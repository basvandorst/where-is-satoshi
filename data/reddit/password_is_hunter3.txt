It depends on whether or not the gold market participants knew that was going to happen. If they did, the halving event would already be priced in, according to the efficient markets hypothesis. If the supply was halved unexpectedly, then the price would jump unexpectedly. Since it is well established that the bitcoin halving will occur after a specific number of blocks have been mined, we have to assume that the price will not change much.

Governments can change Bitcoin's value and influence any aspect at the drop of a policy or regulation at any time.
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:52:45
Or they could just tax it heavily. Same effect.

I believe this is correct. I don't have time to develop a payoff matrix, but from a game theory perspective, it appears that all nodes running Bitcoin-XT would be the [Nash Equilibrium]( unless there is some significant drawback to using Bitcoin-XT in the short term (bugs, glitches, etc.)
*Edit: It might not actually be this simple, since node operators have differing opinions about block sizes. And if every node starts running Bitcoin-XT to account for possible consensus, then is that not a self-fulfilling prophecy? Nodes that recognize this and don't want block size increases will probably avoid switching, especially with the grace period as mentioned in another comment.

Ok let's play out this analogy. Trains required significant infrastructure development. So does Bitcoin; so far so good. Compared to horses, trains require no further user understanding than "this machine you are sitting in will take you from point A to point B faster than any animal". Bitcoin, however, requires the user to not only have the physical technology (train instead of horse) but also requires a much higher technical savviness than what the average person in the U.S., let alone the world, has. This is easy to forget on Reddit, a forum which caters to the tech savvy. And sure, you can make the argument that "people just need to know that they can pay for goods and services just like any other currency-- it's just digital instead of physical", but that ignores the fact that many (most) people won't understand how to receive it, store it, and transfer it. The only way to understand these three key factors is to understand how the blockchain and digital wallets work. Grandma doesn't want to have to figure out her "SHA256-encrypted private key" when she can just drop a $20 bill in the mail for her grandson at Christmas time.
tl;dr Bitcoin is a train that requires the user to also be the conductor instead of just a passenger.

If this happens, it won't be in any of our lifetimes. That's a very long term outlook.

The U.S.Congress could pass a law that says: "Cryptocurrencies are now illegal. Anyone who purchases goods or services with cryptocurrency will be arrested." I realize this is an extreme example but something along these lines could certainly happen.

Of course, by the time the blockchain reaches a few TB, perhaps typical hard drives/network speeds will have expanded/increased?

1. I was merely trying to extend your analogy; if it's a bad analogy, sorry but I'm not the one who made it.
2. "People just deal with any change in the infrastructure of their life". Ever heard the saying "we are creatures of habit"? The human mind resists change, especially when it involves something psychologically important to it. I think we can agree that money is one of the most psychologically important things for humans today (whether or not this is a good thing is for another debate). Think about how long it has taken people's attitudes to change on important social issues like race, gender, and sexual orientation. The timescales of these slow social changes are how I envision the adoption of a digital currency-- it's on the order of generations and lifetimes; not years.
3. I agree with you that bitcoin has not reached it's full potential, I think the disagreement is on how *long* it will take to reach said potential (at least that's what my original comment in this thread was about).
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:59:36
Exactly. Bitcoin income, Bitcoin transactions, and Bitcoin investments could all be taxed.
@_date: 2015-07-13 01:43:32
The fact that you (and the bitcoin world as a whole) are using a USD conversion rate as a metric for improvement for the technology designed to replace currency as we know it means we still have a long way to go.
@_date: 2015-07-13 02:00:59
How long has human civilization been using paper/metal currency? (Hint: millennia). Will that change overnight? No. Will that change over 1 decade? No. Will that change over 1 century? Maybe. All I'm saying is that a change of this magnitude in the financial world will take more time than it took the world to adopt "network technologies" (i.e. become addicted to Facebook).
