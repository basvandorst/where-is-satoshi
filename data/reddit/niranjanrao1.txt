OK this worked, bitcoind is running now, thanks.I have upvoted your answer. But do I have to do this every time I run bitcoind in the future? How do I set bitcoind to pick up my conf file from this location permanently?

I did the following and it worked: on Windows, I opened the Properties of my Desktop shortcut to bitcoind, and within the shortcut tab&gt;target, I added -datadir="C:\\BTC\\Bitcoin Core Data" to make it:
C:\\BTC\\Bitcoin\\daemon\\bitcoind.exe -datadir="C:\\BTC\\Bitcoin Core Data"
Now it works smoothly. But if I use some other shortcut file in future, I have to remember to do this for that file too.

Thank you - how do I start bitcoin-qt with the -server option, please? I added server=1 to my conf file - does that do it? By the way, another funny thing is - my conf file is not in the appdata folder (I'm on Windows) but instead in the bitcoin data directory.

Good. You can enter whatever you want into that file and it will do what you ask it to. Have fun.

Perhaps I must clarify - my bitcoin data directory is not appdata/roaming/bitcoin. It is another directory that I specified during the installation. This is a common practice. The bitcoin.conf file has been created by default in this directory too, which is being picked up by bitcoin-qt, so that's good. Unfortunately bitcoind still continues to look for the conf file in appdata/roaming/bitcoin instead of in the bitcoin data directory. I'm having to use bitcoind --datadir=&lt;path&gt; when I run bitcoind every time. I'm looking for a way to point bitcoind towards the correct data directory permanently.

Check out [ and scroll down. I don't think you can make it go faster but you can prune and do other stuff that might help. All the best.

Thank you - but there seems to be a problem - on cmd, it appears to look for the conf file in the appdata folder (I'm on Windows) but instead my conf file is in the bitcoin data directory chosen by me when I installed the core GUI. I can see that the "open configuration file" button in the GUI's settings&gt;options page is pointed at the correct path for the conf file (in the data directory). In that file, I have server=1 and also daemon=1 (not sure if that applies to Windows). But it's not working since bitcoind doesn't appear to be running. What should I do?  
@_date: 2018-10-25 03:48:50
That doesn't work, I'm afraid. Actually, bitcoin-qt already points to the correct data directory and the conf file within it (not the default directory). It is bitcoind that needs to be re-aligned since it is still looking at the default directory.

Thanks nullc - I'm facing a similar problem. I want all my incoming and outgoing connections to be via Tor only. I have listen=1 in my conf file (no discover command), and have set my Bitcoin Core GUI to connect through socks5 proxy 127.0.0.1 (port 9150 since I'm using Tor browser). The checkbox for Tor is automatically checked under that. I have allowed incoming connections too. The weird thing is, even though I see 1 incoming connection from time to time, the outgoing connections are steady at 8. Any idea why?

Is the conf file totally missing or is it in the wrong directory? For me, it's in the data directory (where bitcoin-qt is picking it up elegantly) but bitcoind still looks for it in the appdata folder. Weird!
@_date: 2018-10-24 04:36:22
OK. Open the GUI, go to settings&gt;options and at the bottom left, click on "open configuration file". It will open the file for you and you can find out where it is located. Does this help?

Slightly confused:  
1. The conf file was not created by me, but by bitcoin-qt itself in the data directory, instead of the /appdata/roaming/bitcoin (default) directory. But still, bitcoind is pointing to the /appdata/roaming/bitcoin directory (default). Why is this? How can I fix this permanently? If I move the conf file to the default directory myself, won't it mess up the GUI's working?  
2. I just ran bitcoind using the --datadir=&lt;path&gt; and it worked (it picked up specific instructions like proxy etc from the conf file which is in my data directory and not the default directory), without any --conf=&lt;path-to-conf&gt; command. Doesn't this mean the --conf=&lt;path-to-conf&gt; command is not needed?

Thanks for the answer, that's clear now. No.1 sounds risky but I'll give it a shot. Hope it works out okay. Thanks and have a great day.

Please help - why is my Bitcoin Conf file in the wrong directory? 
I  am running a Bitcoin Core GUI-based full node on Windows 10. The conf  file is in my bitcoin data directory, instead of being in the  appdata/roaming folder. But bitcoind and bitcoin-cli continue to look  for the conf file in that appdata/roaming folder, which I guess is the  reason the bitcoind server never appears to start. However, Bitcoin-qt appears to work fine and is pointing to the right directory. How do I start  bitcoind and check if it is running or not? If I run it on cmd, it appears to start downloading the whole blockchain again, which is  unnecessary because I already have all of it.

The ease of buying one place and sending it to your own private wallet is awesome - but how is that enabled by the unidirectionality of the payment channel? Wouldn't a 2-way channel achieve the same thing? What exactly is the advantage of the unidirectionality? Appreciate a reply, thanks!  too

First of all, well done to the folks at Bitx/Luno for applying themselves to a genuine problem of long-term consequence to all of us, instead of just focusing on business as usual. Given the numerous business challenges they additionally face, they could be forgiven for simply focusing on those and not investing in forward-looking tech.
Some questions: 
1. Why unidirectional channels? What's the objective?
2. Does this mean customers have to commit a certain amount of BTC as capital, in order to use the moonbeam system?
3. If I have my own wallet and not a hosted wallet, how do I directly hook it up with Luno and perform trades in and out of that?
4. Nice touch with the domain name system. Saves time for all of us.
