But you can't buy anything with Bitcoin

^ The cult of Bitcoin everyone. Please enjoy the ride while you can. I'm sure you'll remember just how low liquidity Bitcoin has when you decide to cash out only to realize no one will be buying at that price.

Can you get me a source? Because Bitcoin's liquidity is infamously low.

So you're an early bird. But there are lots of people being sucked in now by the hype and allure of unrealistic returns. People should learn from the past, all it took to start the Great Depression was a single man withdrawing more than his bank had on hand. This Bitcoin bubble is no different, all it takes is a handful of people looking to cash out and realize that there aren't enough people actually buying at this price. Bitcoin isn't functioning as a currency at the moment, it's functioning as a speculative investment and that's dangerous to both the owners and the currency itself.

Ok then, so how do you expect to be able to get a return on your investment? Do you seriously expect a constant increase in the ATH? Are you never going to sell? Bitcoin isn't going up because it's becoming more accepted or easier to use, it's going u because of speculation and people looking to get easy returns. If you don't convert your Bitcoins to actual eventually, you'll be sucked in when the bubble pops.

It's too late to invest. Now is time to sell.
