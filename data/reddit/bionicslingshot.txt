Why is that?  Are my USD trading volumes off?

Assuming they make 50 mil next year in revenues, I know many investors paying 15-20x 2014 revenue for cloud SAAS companies right now. Look at netsuite (N) , workday (WDAY) etc... 
Honestly I skimmed your post but like some of the points. Know of any way we can invest in these companies?

Nice! I'd recommend "will fork for bitcoin" as well.

Also it's regulated.

It's called deflation.

What is this exactly? Transaction volume in bitcoin?

Thanks. It's common to hear the horror stories but not the pleasant ones. I have had nothing but good things to say about Coinbase so far. 
I do think the site has good backing and seems pretty transparent but if shit hits the fan, I'd like another option. You can never be too careful.

Anyone can print out a piece of paper, tape it to the window,  and walk outside to take a picture. We'd like some real evidence such as a video of a transaction.   
It's like a strip club in here, everyone's eyes are too wide to realize the fake tits in their face.

How are you sure about this?

Currency wars have just taken a new turn.

Pretty sure you can look back at this post and do some research to enlighten yourself on basic market manipulation.  My theory still stands.

Check out Foodler. It's similar to seamless web and you can buy Foodler dollars with bitcoin. I've been using it for a while now.

OP doesn't mean exodus as in price will go down.  Instead exodus of fiat via purchasing bitcoins and sending them to other wallets.
Also, Could be that MtGox has cash flow problems.  
Solution?  
Sell their own stash of bitcoins at any cost and let the withdrawals withdraw before everyone loses faith in the exchange.

You are explaining the exact reason why the "pump and dump" technique works.  As you buy the lowest ask price, the next ask price is shown.  If you have been doing this with a lot of money ($2 bil market cap in the real world is pocket change by the way) on a long enough basis you can create the illusion of value creation.  
Tricking the thousands of people who have no idea what they are doing (research the stock bubble of the great depression) will create a selling opportunity when you and all your friends sell at the top.  Creating a massic panic after your sells since noone else is buying.

I think there is a bartering tax for this reason. You'll be evading taxes even if you do this.
