Yes. Def means nothing to him though.

BTW there is an interesting phrase describing the most tough miners - Iron Head. LOL

Yeah Korea political situation was a huge drive for 2017 bull run.  If you stay there for like 7 days you would clearly feel that.

Maybe I do feel superior deep in subconsciousness because I am different. But consciously I tell my self - just don't do that. LOL

Big congrats dude! Even though I am in one of those countries which can't use your service, wish you a huge success with this launch!

Chinese capital went to Beverly Hills LOL. BTW another reason for bitcoin exchange rate high than dollar exchange rate in Korea is - they don't have any miners. They need to "import" bitcoins from outside.

I am from China. The miners here are thinking in advance. Actually lots of them are building mining farms outside of China now.
For halving, what I can tell is that it seems like miners are CRAZY now. Most of them are mortgaging to expand their farms. Also giants like Bitmain offers renting services for miners which is also boosting the bubble here.
Maybe it is not a bubble. Will see.

For exchanges like upbit, if you go to their HC, you would see a huge space like Apple store. Long wood desks with tablets on the table.  And lots of young colleagues were introducing how to do trading for old people.

I thought they only remove vids about shit coins or promotion for scams. Even tutorials now???!!!

Yes some people are definitely missing the point of owning crypto. It's not about making you a billionaire. It's about giving you some human rights that you never had before.

Secure element is must for a hardware wallet imo.

Buy BTC with your credit card on any major exchange, send to Wasabi wallet, use coinjoin with 100 anonimity, and then send it to Exodus wallet. Once in Exodus, echange to another coin and exchange back.
