This makes no sense? Should I not spend any money on anything, because the price of bitcoin is going up?
You act like spending is voluntary. Have fun starving.

In your example it would still make more sense to buy BTC with that cash instead of spending the cash directly. (Disregarding fees)

You don't seem to understand my point.
You say it makes no sense to spend a currency that will triple in price over a short amount of time.
Then following that logic it makes no sense to own any other currency. 
Following that logic it makes a lot of sense to ONLY own the currency which will triple its value in a short amount of time right?
Now all you have is the currency which will triple its value, meaning you HAVE to spend THAT currency to survive, because you have nothing else.

I'm assuming all your holdings are in BTC, the price is going up, only makes sense right?
So now you have to buy food, you have to liquidate some of your BTC, it doesn't matter whether you convert it into LTC or not.
You have to spend Bitcoin in this scenario, you can't JUST spend Litecoin.
Unless you have holdings in both LTC and BTC, but then let me return to your initial comment and let me replace "coffee" with "ltc".

Depends on how you define 'Bitcoin' in the first place.

I mean I guess, but is it automated?

Talking about the bitcoin cash fork.
Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash are two sides of the same coin.
It's like when a road 'ends' and two roads fork of it, you can't really say one is more the original road than the other, as both are a continuation of the former and nobody driving there cares who built which road.
That said some people will argue, that if one of the two streets is longer than the other, or the other dead ends, that that is the legitimate original road.
endorses BCH which in their eyes is the original road more so than the other one which forked off.
So saying is anti-bitcoin is slightly misleading as BCH is bitcoin too.
That said I think all of this branding is pretty nonsensical and arguing which fork is more bitcoin than the other is a rather wasteful way to spend ones time, as in the end this isn't really meaningful in any way.
Just like calling other cryptocurrencies 'alt-coins' is just semantic nonsense.
That's like calling all IBM Computers 'PC' and every other manufacturers 'Alt-PC', consumers don't give a toss about it and if they don't why should anyone.
