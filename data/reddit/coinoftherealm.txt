Some of my comments yesterday to his tweet posting his letter were missing this morning.   Nothing bad - I just asked him if he had read Ben Bernanke and Larry Summner's comments regarding Bitcoin.   I reposted them.  His letter seems really amusing especially considering Janet Yellen's comments today.   I wonder if some in the US government are not beginning to be much more serious about Bitcoin.   My hope and prayer is that Bitcoin could come along side of a very dangerous system, grow and provide a new system that could be an alternative to forced inflation and potential outright failure.   I know that this is hoping uphill - but I pray that some of the leaders would see the innovation potential comparable to the internet that Bitcoin is.

When I got into bitcoin 2 years ago a friend gave me some for free (I think he was giving away 10 at a time then) and I am thankful for that - I think the best way for people to understand bitcoin is to have some and then figure out what that means.

Did anyone else see this morning the huge wall at 80 that was removed?   Only 25k to get to $100.   At $92/BTC the market capitalization would exceed $1,000,000,000.   That would be a BIG milestone.

I like your point.  I guess as long as their are miners on the Bitcoin network - and the protocol meets no unforeseen flaw - a bitcoin really would not be exchanged at $0.  That would be the case because there would always be a market for exchanging money at very low costs.  Silk Road was probably the reason for Bitcoin having value early and gaining some adoption.   So - the users of Silk Road don't give a shit about government regulations - were the first adopters and would stick with it through thick and thin.

the best way to tell someone how awesome bitcoin is is to give them some and maybe they will see up a client or online wallet.   I got a large stash from two years ago and a friend gave me 10 bitcoins when they were at $.25 each.   Just wanted to celebrate the one billion market capitalization and share some with some new folks.

I have used Mt Gox and it works pretty good for larger amounts - you have to have a bank wire or go through dwolla.   To get some bitcoins quickly I would use BitInstant and take cash to a Walmart and you can have coins that way.   Or find something you could possibly trade for bitcoins using localbitcoins.com or bitcoin-otc.com.  Everyone thinks the price is too high - but my opinion is that bitcoin is cheap right now compared to it's potential.   I would take what extra you could afford and use BitInstant gradually over time to build up a stash.

Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg - a lot of folks are early adopters.   Even when they control large sections of the worth - they still work in their best interests and don't destroy what they have created.   I think there are some large wallets out there - but that is a good thing.   From listening alot in the bitcoin community - one thing about the early developers, miners, etc. is that they value this project very much.   Overtime the coins will spread out as the market sees fit.

The rise in fiat pricing of a bitcoin is part of the neccessary growing pains of the project.   It will go up and it will go down.   I have seen the value of my coins go up 1500% and then down 1500% then up 4700%.   I didn't sell when they came down because I believed in the nuts and bolts of the system and new that speculation would not kill bitcoin.   I see it as a project that is so ripe for today's current events.   It is the marriage of modern technology and money into a new way of relating with the world.   It has more power to keep politicians, central bankers and the priviledged honest than any protest or vote I could cast.
I would advise you to buy some bitcoin - not a crazy amount but some.   If the market goes up great - if it goes down and you still believe in it buy some at a cheaper price.    But I get your point we are in a phase where everyone thinks they have been left out and are afraid to touch it.   But when I bought my first stash a $2/BTC I felt the same way as you do today.   here is something to get you started:

I think if you dont accept it in the next two weeks it comes back.
Or if you set up an online wallet you can get an address and it can be sent there too.   Good luck.

yes do that - a friend gave me 10 BTC in early 2011 when they were about $ 0.25 apiece.   Got me interested and bought a stash back then.   The best way to tell someone about bitcoin is to give them some.   Good luck.

I think that Cyprus illustrates advantages of Bitcoin but the drive in price is also affected by the news that Bitpay has processed over 2 mil in business (in March) and is constantly having to convert that fiat.   Also Satoshi dice is a real world use of Bitcoins that has exploded in volume.   I think also when the mining rate cut in half a few months ago that also kicked up the price.   I think there is also some hedge fund money that is picking up sizable blocks of coins.   Those things along with other developments like bitinstant and coinbase, etc are helping flow broadbase fiat into the market.   I think these fundamentals are what is supporting the price increases.

Question: Since Mt Gox is shut down for the market to cool off - where can you keep up with how the order book is changing? I understand that they are not allowing new orders to be placed - but it is my understanding that old orders can be canceled. Can anyone shed any light on this? The charts I normally look at don't seem to be changing. Thanks.
