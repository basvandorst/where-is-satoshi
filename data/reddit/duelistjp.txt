that would be true if the futures were settled in bitcoin.  but these futures are cash settled.  basically you have someone who says bitcoin is going to go up.  and you have someone who thinks it will go down.  the futures manager helps get these people together and they make a bet.  in a month they settle up as if they had sold bitcoin at that price by giving cash in an amount according to what they value of bitcoin would have been if they owned it.  because they just pay the difference in cash no bitcoin is ever bought or sold.  therefore in the strictest sense these futures have no direct effect on the bitcoin market

and that is an arbitrary limit by the time we get over $100k.btc they'll simply modify to have it divisible even more

the reason is the hashing power on the network is what gives it security.  aside from a few alts that have major issues with centralization beyond bitcoins own the hash market of any other 3rd gen cryptocurrency is inadequate to secure it

i'm saying depending on the amount it is a reasonable idea.  it's nothing serious if it goes to nothing but may make a big deal if it goes on to become the world reserve currency.  if you feel the chance is somewhat reasonable then why not put a little aside for people you want to take care of in your life

the deadline is the 11th but they close on weekends.  there is a rule that says the deadline would be extended to next business day the 13th but lawyers are still debating whether it applies and not ruling would cause severe confusion and large amounts of lost investor money so it is likely they will rule today but we might not see it to monday.  if they don't rule today assume it is monday.  they have never let anything get default approval they always rule

as long as you have segwit active any segwit transactions can't be modified.  if you are in a situation where you need malleability protection you use segwit.  all the soft forks for legacy transactions only address specific attacks not general malleability.  new attack vectors will be found. not too mention transaction malleability is necessary for multiple input transactions and is therefore not something you want to eliminate

 got on a mailing list i figure if i sell within a few minutes of the announcement i can hopefully cut my losses but this is just a little money i only own 1.25 bitcoin.  bought .25 bitcoin a while back and just been playing around with trading to get to here
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:10:34
a lot of people had it set to sell if the price started going down to cut their losses  if the etf wasn't approved.  their buying caused the price to rise enough to get other auto buys to buy raising the price higher. then they sold and made a profit.  the massive selloff caused the price to rapidly fall below what it originally was for a short time.  this caused all those sell orders to be activated.  these people lost money possibly by selling low.  this is especially bad if the coins were leveraged where they had only paid part of the cost for them and borrowed the rest
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:55:24
if the people used segwit their transactions could not have been malleated.  this type of malleability has use cases where this behavior is desirable.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:47:45
the huge benefit is unless you want to spend about $20k making complicated legal entities you can't currently hold bitcoin in your ira.  that would have brought extremely large amounts of dollars into bitcoin reducing volatility hopefully
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:13:16
that only applies to submissions not approvals accordding to many lawyers.  they are all still debating it
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:12:28
when they d=sold their coins above $1300 it caused a drop in the price to somewhat below the original price.  this triggered stop loss orders which pushed it down further

being able to have people put their iras in bitcoin would get a lot more money n the ecosystem.  besides raising the price it would go a long way to increasing knowledge of bitcoin and decreasing volatility after the initial influx
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:24:14
basically the deadline is saturday but the sec is closed on weekends.  there is a rule regarding deadlines being pushed to the next business day but the lawyers can't determine if it applies.  its important because if they don't rule on friday they could very well take it as being passed after the 11th.

@_date: 2017-03-11 00:45:05
no honestly 2% if they dumped it at once might takes us down around $500 for a moment.  2% is huge for a currency.  still would be a good thing overall.  that much centralization is untenable long term for a currency and if they got the etf it would have grown bigger share

? how do you get that.  he decided there was more money there than he was willing to lose so he sold half at a 400% profit.  reasonable decision.  but that means he took out twice the entire amount of dollars he put in and still has some bitcoin left.  that is not a 5% profit and is in fact at least a 100% return more as long as the value of his remaining bitcoin doesn't go to zero

no because in this case neither of them has any bitcoin.  the exchange has a bunch of bitcoin and some sort of bookkeeping saying how much is able to be withdrawn by what account.  so transferring to another account on the exchange is a traditional bookkeeping entry and per transaction has a nearly nonexistant cost the exchange handles as part of doing business.  it is dwarfed by the other types of fees they get.  the person you send it too has no bitcoin still till he transfers it out of the exchange to his wallet which will incur a fee most likely as that is using the blockchain bookkeeping system which costs significantly more

well the portion of the real estate company his father gave him was at least $40m.  there was a million dollar loan and there was a closed settlement on how the estate was divided after his father's death but assuming it was divided equally that would be around $60m.  so he most likely overall got about $100m from his dad.  sure he has managed to get that up to around 3.1b but a lot of people's net worth is 30 times what their parents left them in inheritance
