...for now. People were saying the same thing about the internet in the 90's. Coinbase has already made it easier for the GP to use Bitcoin.

That's weird, blockchain.info is the top result for me. Have you checked your computer for malware?
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:01:59
I'm talking about china. Seems like news from there has the price on a string. Bad news from China price goes down, good news price goes up.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:19:13
They're called trolls. Don't feed them.
@_date: 2014-05-25 03:32:39
Got it, thanks. You're still $4 over the Coinbase price/BTC AFTER Coinbase's fee's etc. are added.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:29:57
get avast or avg antivirus. They're free.
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:46:24
Yeah, seconded.

Get the Dogecoin and Litecoin community in on this.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:06:18
apparently it worked. It's gone.
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:52:08
I smell another drugs.com
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:09:56
You're not gonna quiet the trolls. Just ignore them.
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:54:44
Oh, PICK ME!
@_date: 2014-05-25 03:14:46
Um, hate to point this out but right now the Bitcoin price on Coinbase is $534 while your price is $579. Why the major increase?
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:25:35
I use it all the time. It allows you to tip people small amounts of bitcoin and make sure it goes to use. If they don't claim the tip by the expiration you get your bitcoin back.
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:56:33
It's menufy. They need to take them off. I went to one hoping to pay for my dinner with bitcoin and the server didn't know what bitcoin was. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 03:24:30
I see, my bad. strange that Canadian and US $'s have the same symbol. You may want to clarify that, I'm sure I'm not the only person to open an account and get suspicious on seeing the price.
@_date: 2014-03-21 13:41:12
Yeah, you may be right.
@_date: 2014-03-28 08:56:14
It's all good. You still can't control the Bitcoin supply. If the Dollar fails and people flock to Bitcoin the price will stabilize. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:05:46
So the Cap would need to be 7.5 Trillion $'s. Totally doable. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:04:16
I was more thinking about licencing sales businesses with a trained, full time sales team. Also the neck-beard thing is happening anyway.  
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:15:03
Maybe the government is getting around to offloading all there bitcoins they seized. The 144k bitcoins would be enough to cause the market to dip.
@_date: 2014-08-13 17:48:54
My baseless speculation is big investors are getting in and are manipulating the price to get a discount.
@_date: 2014-04-08 07:47:28
I only plan to do it as a supplement. I just printed my first ones bctip.org has an ingenious system where they make the paper wallets for you and if they arn't redeemed by an expiration date they'll be automatically returned.
@_date: 2014-05-03 20:18:52
It's still here.
@_date: 2014-05-08 05:03:31
Try it AFK as well: bctip.org
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:54:52
Apparently someones already done that: 
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:08:18
Donated, he's actually pretty solid as far as politicians go.
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:46:53
I found a site that does it easily: bctip.org
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:38:42
...has trouble with capitalization though.
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:24:41
Thought of this. I turned my adBlock off and it still didn't show up.
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:40:06
It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do it.
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:47:48
No, my original plan was to print a bunch of paper wallets with their own private keys. send some bitcoin to each one and use them as tips. I found a service that streamlines this so I just use that: bctip.org
@_date: 2014-05-25 08:24:01
Fingers Crossed
@_date: 2014-04-08 07:36:08
Nevermind, found bctip.org
@_date: 2017-02-24 00:50:32
Also people will be a lot more careful with their Bitcoin as it gains value. This has already happened.
@_date: 2017-02-11 07:48:22
Dollar cost average. I buy every two weeks to a month depending on how much money I can put into it. Use limit orders on Gemini.
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:03:32
You won't need to report capitol gains on purchases. You only need to pay capitol gains on income &gt; $600.
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:58:16
Fingers crossed. Look at the double dip at the right side of the chart. That could happen.
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:44:53
Don't store your coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:40:42
You try a credit union?
@_date: 2017-01-11 03:53:51
Samourai Wallet not private, decentralized, or secure. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 17:06:50
I'd use local bitcoins to buy bitcoins in person instead. Better experience.
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:57:45
Damn Chinese miscreants disobeying China's beneficent leaders!

You can get 5% off Starbucks with Bitcoin right now!  
@_date: 2017-01-07 09:54:26
Greed's part of it. Rebellion against the Fed is another. Reading the Bitcoin whitepaper and being blown away by its simplicity is yet another reason. There are lots of reasons, but if your main reason is to try to make a quick buck Bitcoin probably isn't for you.
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:58:59
I sold 30% of my holdings just in case of a bigger dip.
@_date: 2016-11-19 18:45:54
WOO! THAT'S 0.006% BOYS!
@_date: 2016-11-08 04:43:52
@_date: 2016-12-05 01:10:16
And it's far less in fee's
@_date: 2017-01-07 09:44:35
If you'd love to see Bitcoin die then yeah.
@_date: 2016-12-13 20:59:40
5% off Starbucks with Bitcoin here: 
You're welcome. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 03:38:19
The wall just got TEN FEET HIGHER!

You can get Starbucks with it.
