Thanks for the help. I tried that. Also, at around the same time (May 2017) my gf also bought 0.27 BTC and kept it in her own wallet and hasn't touched it since. I have just checked on findmycoins.ninja with her address and it is showing hers as having BCH, so idk about mine. It's annoying that it looks like I've lost my BCH, but it was a free perk of having bought before the split so I guess it could be worse, I still have my other coins.
I'll take the loss with the BCH and be thankful that overall I'm still at a profit. Thanks for your help.

So say I have wallet W1 which is the electrum wallet that I have had since May 2017. Electrum gives you multiple addresses for the same wallet right? Electrum history shows that I had 0.27 BTC in wallet W1 prior to the split date, and on the day of the split I've recorded a deposit of 0.27 BCH in CoinTracking (just to record it).
Since then I have bought more BTC from localbitcoins and used wallet W1 as an intermediate wallet, so have received coins to and sent coins from that wallet to various other places. I have also sold other crypto's since then. In wallet W1 electrum is showing that I now have 0.17 BTC combined in the various addresses. 
So after all of this, should I still be able to access 0.27 BCH because that is the amount of BTC I had in my wallet W1 at the time of the split?

It looks like I must have moved my coins to a different address at some point, thanks for your help though.

Thanks again for the help. I just tried this but it's only showing about $5 worth of other coins when I'd expect about $100 BCH. I have traded some coins on exchanges so I guess I must have sent the ones that would have had the BCH right?
