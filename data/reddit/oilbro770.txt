You can only put in $40k if people are selling BTC at any price.
The higher people hold out the higher the price will be. 
Maybe the first few dozen? Hundred? Thousand? Millionaires could put in $40k on market buys before the market realizes big buys are happening and BTC sellers adjust their price higher and higher..

No. According to investopedia.com the gifter has to settle out in terms of dollars. For example, she acquired the BTC at $1 each and she gifts it at $15k each. She must now pay capital gains (assuming it's been more than 12 months) on the $14,999 that her investment gained. Assuming 10%  capital gains tax rate for her would imply she needs to pay $1,499 per btc to the IRS. 
The IRS is currently treating cryptocurrency as property. We must pay the capital gains. However, in the IRS's favor, if we take a loss, the IRS will only grant a tax write off of $3,000.

According to OP's source,
We've doubled the M1 supply 3 times in 30 years.
We've increased the M1 supply by 8x in 30 years.
According to the below source, $100 in 1988 would be worth $212.77 in 2019. Which translates to 46.99% of the value is retained or 53.01% of the value lost in those 30 years.
Why isn't our inflation as severe? 
Shouldn't our current value be 1/8th or 12.5% with a lost value of 87.5%?
Perhaps someone here can help me out in understanding.

That's interesting but I feel like it's flawed.
When you say


I'm confused by that statement and not sure how you defend it


I think this is absolutely how it works. If we have a money supply of 100 shells and it represents all the value of our village and I suddenly find 100 more identical shells, our currency supply has doubled, the value of our village is still the same, and the value of each shell has been halved.
Now a merchant in my village would take twice as many shells for any good or service they provided as a single shell is twice as easy to get. 
This is absolutely how inflation works.
What my initial question was asking was why wasn't it increasing at a one to one ratio.

@_date: 2019-08-22 08:29:15
Sorry this may be a little long. Hope it can help. 
I don't know why you are talking about fairness. The only people who get to decide how and how much to spend/receive are the ones in the transaction. They have to come to an agreement on what they are going to spend.
At some point in the future Bitcoin payments will no longer be priced in USD. Example: Your rent will just be 20,000 Satoshis per month. (This will in itself be a major driver in Bitcoin value stability) 
With all of that said, if the rental agreement is to pay $500 worth of USD or Bitcoin on the 1st of every month for rent, then when you send the funds it must match that. 
Example of what NOT to do:
If the entire month of January Bitcoin was at $500/BTC and then early morning February 1st it goes to $250/BTC,  you decide to only pay 1 Bitcoin valued at $250 because all of January it was $500. The landlord only receives $250 of value/buying power.
 (You have not sent complete payment)
Opposite Example of what NOT to do:
If the entire month of January Bitcoin was at $500/BTC and then early morning February 1st it goes to $1000/BTC,  you decide to pay 1 Bitcoin valued at $1000 because all of January it was $500. The landlord receives $1000 of value/buying power.
(You overpaid)
The moral of the story is that if you're part of a transaction and you are worried about getting butthurt about the value changing then perhaps you shouldn't be spending from your "HODL"stack and spend and replace your BTC. Over time that will be a DCA method in itself with your replacement costs in BTC.

You can do this. It's called a paper wallet. However there is a large risk with those. See below link. 
(I'm on mobile) 
A hardware wallet generates and stores the keys. So generation of a private key is very important and it needs to be in a secure environment. 
A HW wallet is simply a product to help someone get very high level security with a minimal level of security knowledge.

You now have 3 different paths to your bitcoin. That means 3x more likely to be compromised.
A HW wallet does not contain your coins. It contains the private key. If you lose the wallet, you can retrieve your private key utilizing the "backup" seed that the HW wallet generates when it is first initialized.

In The US they have no cap on how much you can be taxed when you profit.
However, when you take a loss they cap your losses at $3k per year. (You can roll your losses from this year to next year and the next until it's all been deducted)
So if you have $100k losses this year you still get to write off the losses over the next 34 years.

I think using an arbitrary man-made length of time, one year, is not accurate enough for lows/highs. I believe if you took peak to trough data it would be more valuable. 
There just isn't any realistic correlation that a January 1st to December 31st cycle has all of the data.

If you leave the USA and renounce your citizenship the gov will take an exit tax. If you do not pay the exit tax you will be considered a criminal for tax evasion. 
The exit tax is a tax on all your assets irregardless of the liquidity. 
E.g. a home that you are not selling valued at 500,000 will be taxed at 20% (for example) and you'll pay $100,000 out of pocket. (This is true for all assets)

I'm paying my taxes, begrudgingly.. But for some reason I don't feel that crypto should be taxed. It just doesn't connect in the same way that an investment in a company exists. I feel like this is beyond the realm of governments and borders. It's like trying to tax the oxygen that's in the airspace within the US borders.
Regardless of how silly the laws try to classify it.
For example, You "must" file an FBAR aka FinCen form 114 if you have had at least $10k worth of any asset or financial instrument in a foreign account at any given time in 2017 ( even if only for a minute ). So they are using this to say if you have transferred $10,001 worth of BTC from coinbase (USA) to binance (China) you are to report.
However, the problem is that bitcoin does not exist in the physical realm. There is no location for Bitcoin. It is  within a digital network and kept track of on ledgers across the globe. Therefore, there is no "foreign account" 
Btw, you "must" file a FATCA aka form 8938 if you had $50,000 in transactions on a "foreign account"
Both of these things have extremely harsh penalties and I haven't heard anyone winning against the gov.
Penalties include: 
$10,000 fine if you failed to report because you didn't not know you had to 
$100,000 fine or 50% account value (whichever is greater) if you knowingly failed to report
Things to note:
FBAR is simply a report to notify the gov financial crimes department (FINCEN) and there are no taxes on these reports
FATCA is reported to the IRS
