This is exactly the type of reporting we need to legitimize Bitcoin. We are finally seeing the tiny baby steps in the right direction for the general public to truly accept Bitcoin and other digital currencies. I can't think of a better time to start stocking up.

Would love to help in anyway I can. Let me know if you need support

This is the real use case for bitcoin. There has never been a time in all of humanity that a single tool could help lift entire countries out of poverty, war, and collapse, all without any possibility of intervention by a corporation or nation-state. We can, for the first time ever, lend a helping hand directly to people around this world, in real time, with the money going straight to their pocket. No middlemen. No government censorship. No fraud. No artificial inflation. And no bailing out. This is the return of sound money for the globe and the beginning of the end of perpetual war. 
Hearing stories like this just renew my love of this technology and gives me real hope for the future of humanity. Do you have any access to setting up some kind of donation website via Bitcoin? Sounds like you are able to survive better than most over there. Im sure if there was a thing the community would be proud to participate in it. Thoughts?
Good luck out there

This is common story for a major percentage of the worlds population. Its something worth considering next time you go out for dinner.

I don't know, it sure sounds like an email that is looking at the use of digital currency seriously as opposed to not taking it seriously. Ven may be stupid, but recognizing this stuff should be seen as a move in the right direction. Not sure where the conspiracy hate in this thread is coming from.

Yeah this is pretty ridiculous, but the fact that Hillary's camp was (is?) seriously looking into this bodes well for the future of digital currency. It's a tiny, yet interesting, look into how Washington thinks about this stuff.
