Are you sure that the other 7 billion people on Earth will all have that same opinion. If so why? If they missed the Bitcoin boat why would they not want to pump Litecoin?

The great irony is that what started as a libertarian / cypherpunk experiment has been co-opted by the establishment. What was an ingenious solution to the Byzantine General problem with a trustless disributed ledger and well balanced incentives has just become a volatility instrument for the banks to bet on the CME / CBOT. It will invetiably crash and take many greedy late adopters down with it. Sound money does not increase in purchasing power 1000% per year. If you claim it is the dollar that is crashing, there is no evidence of that. The purchasing power of the dollar has not declined appreciably in recent times when considering non-asset prices. What has happened from quantitative easing and the increase in the money supply in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis is the inflation of certain asset prices. Dow went from 10,000 to 24,000, Bitcoin from &lt; $1 to &gt; $10,000 (spot). Thus Bitcoin has become just another financial asset whose nominal value is inflated by easy money. Moreover there is substantial evidence that the price of Bitcoin is artificially pumped within its own crypto ecosystem by the creation of fiat Tethers with no real proof of reserves.

The theory is that quantum computing can crack hard encryption quickly. For example quantum computing would be good at prime factorization (Shor's Algorithm). It remains to be seen if it is technically possible to construct a large scale quantum computer that is stable and can actually do real work. I am sceptical that it is possible but if it is that would render Bitcoin instantly worthless. ***However, the article in the link at the top of the page does not focus on this. Please take the time to read the article, since it raises some interesting points.***

LOL! You prove his point. Superior, lasting technology that is not just a flash in the pan wins on its own merits not on the back of speculators.

Either you have a logical response or you are participating quasi-religious cargo cult on faith alone. What do my motivations matter to your lack of ability to defend Bitcoin as what you claim it is? If it really is "Digital Gold" then prove it.

Never mind. Why did he delete his post and his account? Had had a fair point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:58:54
If they are even possible. Read the article. It does not discuss quantum computing but it does raise interesting points.

"This person" is probably a hedge fund. They may have been day trading / leveraged trading the volatility and decided to pull out.

You people have no idea how money works in society. You think you can become the new elite simply by making your coin a meme? Go ahead waste your money on this delusion.

&lt;&lt;Nobody owns it. Nobody is in charge. That’s the beauty of it!&gt;&gt;
is true for just about any other crypto too. What happened to Myspace when Facebook came along?

Why not Litecoin? It is functionally identical except that transactions are cheaper and faster but it is severely undervalued at $100 per coin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:20:55
Only a true FOMOer would be innocent (read: stupid) enough to fall for such an evil scam.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:20:07
8 years ago no-one had heard of Bitcoin either. Who owns the "brand name" anyway? Who is to say that Bitcoin it is not just a fad or silly meme? Tomorrow some bloke could launch a fork from the main chain and call it "Bitcoin 2.0"

The more you use a Bitcoin adress the more expensive it gets. Kind of a bug.

It is called mass delusion / speculative mania and the greater fool theory. Under the greater fool theory you believe that it is a bubble but you are willing to take the risk that you can sell your bitcoin to another person in the future at a higher price than you paid before it pops. The problem is that no one knows when it will pop. The ad hominem attacks and misdirection in most of the responses demonstrate that many people are getting into Bitcoin who have no business here. There is an old saying that a fool and his money are quickly separated and for many here they may be hard pressed to find greater fools than themselves. See for some concerning informaiton.

Why does everyone assume that everyone else is like themselves? This is probably an institutional investor "with balls" who was speculating on the largest and most liquid exchange. They use the word "we" indicating they represent more than one person. Or it could just be an old school whale who likes trading.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:10:13
Yes. Not likely only benevolent actors would have them. That is not the way the world works. Even with a quantum computer it would take a very long time to crack SHA-256.

It can't be dealt with from a technical perspective. You invested in vapourware.

True. But the whole point of using multiple address is anonymity  / security one of the key selling points of Bitcoin.
