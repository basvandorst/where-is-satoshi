I disagree. Bitcoin has never been about creating a new currency but a new currency system, independent of trust and national interest. It's about "breaking the government monopoly on money".
Physical currencies once required the gold standard to remain stable but now they are most commonly backed by trust in the "word" of a government. Bitcoin has acted and continues to act as the 'gold standard' for the entire cryptocurrency market. It doesn't act like gold, it acts like a commodity.... nobody wants to use that analogy because a commodity is something with intrinsic value  but the value of gold not related to its physical utility, so analogy to gold as a commodity is pretty apt.
Bitcoin creates fungibility in the entire cryptocurrency market and making bitcoin easily spendable would have big effects. Bitcoin has an important macroeconomic role to play in establishing a completely new way for a global currency market to function and focusing on its inability to process microtransactions is extremely myopic.
The following is from wikipedia

If tether ever fails a liquidity test the entire space could go down. So many exchanges rely on tether to avoid regulations that would apply to fiat.

Don't be so pejorative.

That defeats the entire purpose of the cryptographic protocol and existence of miners.

* BTC difficulty increase
* BTC mempool completely clogged with insanely high transaction fees
* BTC futures trading
* Coinbase adding BCH without an announcement
* BCH mining becoming more profitable than BTC
* BCH under threat of a 51% attack by "unknown" private miners
* Roger Ver's inept spruiking on CNBC
* Weekend before christmas

It's a psychological trick to manipulate supply and demand and create a self-fulfilling prophecy.... if everyone holds their bitcoin and refuses to sell, because they speculate the value will rise in the future, then the value will rise because supply is limited by all of the people holding and refusing to sell.
If people stop hodling the price will crash because supply will exceed demand.

There needs to be some liquidity, the price can't move if there is zero trade.

Slash and burn capitalism.

I get this sometimes when splitting my output between a  monitor and television. Only fix I've found is to unplug one of them.

You allow any-pair trading so that the entire altcoin market isn't directly driving demand for bitcoin.

I wouldn't argue it's the "main reason" but a significant factor affecting bitcoin prices in the past 12 months. Altcoins create demand and liquidity for bitcoins.
