@_date: 2017-11-10 12:45:57
How are you so sure that they will regret? Any logic behind?

In my view there is no concept of DIP in bitcoin, you can think of the current price as a dip (forecasting the price over next X DAYS) or maybe the Bitcoin will never see the current price!
Conclusion: if you want to get into crypto, JUST BUY IT

just wanted to get public opinion.. nothing else :)

Can't agree more, these hodlers are killing the point of BTC, it's a CURRENCY which is meant to be spent

The only thing that worries me here is that 50 BTC are wiped out of the system. That's a loss to the community!

Not everyone is in the same game as you, let the people do what they want. It's part of the ecosystem and accept it the way it is :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:58:10

@_date: 2017-11-08 19:17:32

Why are people always looking for shortcuts ? 
As you have already mentioned that you have studied at some top Indian University, I think you must have good programming skills too, not many people know such tools and skills, you could still use your knowledge to build something great (only if you are passionate enough to do that) or you can aim for nice highly paying job.
Nevertheless, you can invest some disposable money into crypto, it's never too late. I hope if you do so, you won't regret again after 5 years or so.. 
p.s never think of this as a FINANCIAL LOSS.
