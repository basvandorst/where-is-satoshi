From the order: Under § 1960 Section 1960 does not specify what counts as "money" that is "transmitted," other than to note that it "includes ... funds." 18 U.S.C. § 1960(b)(2). This raises the question of whether bitcoins are "funds" under the statute. The Court concludes that they are. " When a term goes undefined in a statute," courts give the term "its ordinary meaning." Taniguchi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd., 132 S. Ct. 1997, 2002 (2012). The ordinary meaning of "funds," according to Webster's Dictionary, is "available pecuniary resources." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 921 (2002). "Pecuniary" is defined as "taking the form of or consisting of money." Id. at 1663. And "money," in turn, is defined as "something generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment." Id. at 1458. This definition of "funds," and the corresponding definition of "money," have consistently been adopted by courts in this circuit. In United States v. Faiella, Judge Rakoff defined "funds," in the context of interpreting § 1960, as '"available money' or 'an amount of something that is available for use."' 39 F. Supp. 3d 544, 545 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citation omitted). And as the Court does here, he also defined "money" as "something generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment." Id. (citation omitted). Similarly, Judge Forrest has explained that '"[flunds' are defined as 'money, often money for a specific purpose,'" and that '"[m]oney' is an object used to buy things." United States v. Ulbricht, 31 F.Supp. 3d 540, 570 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citation omitted). Although Judge Forrest reached that conclusion in a case involving a different statute-18 U.S.C. § 1956, which prohibits money laundering-she did so by engaging in the same analysis the Court must perform here. See id. (noting that "'[f]unds' is not defined in the statute and is therefore given its ordinary meaning"). In light of this consensus as to the term's ordinary meaning, the Court concludes that "funds," for the purposes of§ 1960, means pecuniary resources, which are generally accepted as a medium of exchange or a means of payment. Applying that definition here, it is clear that bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term. Bitcoins can be accepted "as a payment for goods and services" or bought "directly from an exchange with [a] bank account." Getting started with Bitcoin, bitcoin,  (last visited Sept. 16, 2016). They therefore function as "pecuniary resources" and are "used as a medium of exchange" and "a means of payment." As Judge Rakoff explained, bitcoins "clearly qualif[y] as 'money' or 'funds"' under§ 1960 because they "can be easily purchased in exchange for ordinary currency, act[] as a denominator of value, and [are] used to conduct financial transactions." 39 F. Supp. 3d at 545; see also Ulbricht, 31 F. Supp. 3d at 570 (holding that bitcoins are "funds" because they "can be either used directly to pay for certain things or can act as a medium of exchange and be converted into a currency which can pay for things"). Courts considering other virtual currencies have reached the same conclusion-those currencies also count as "funds" under§ 1960. See Budovsky, 2015 WL 5602853, at* 14 (relying on Faiella for the proposition that "LR," another virtual currency, "qualifies as 'funds' for purposes of§ 1960"); see also United States v. E-Gold, Ltd., 550 F. Supp. 2d 82, 88 (D.D.C. 2008) (noting that "[s]ection 1960 defines 'money transmitting' broadly to include transferring 'funds,' not just currency, by 'any and all means").

Maybe from an epistemological standpoint, but arguing that an administrative agency's clarification doesn't change the rules is the fallacy of equivocation. The circumstances contemplated by MtGox and Coinlab did change as a result of FinCen's guidance; FinCen could have just as easily defined exchanges in such a way that, like users, they didn't need to register. When agencies have that kind of discretion, its hard to claim that the rules they clarify (and often promulgate by their rule-making authority) are mechanically derived from statute. Indeed, the March guidance clarified earlier rules made by the agency.

The mistake you're making is ignoring how the government is defining money transmitters, viz., anyone who "buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason." You can argue, even correctly, that the government doesn't have a clue, but that is not the same as saying there's no transmission. If you truly believe that, why dont you send me all your bitcoins? According to your logic, nothing was transmitted...

It absolutely sucks for Coinlab that Fincen's guidance came when it did; but according to the contract, they carried the risk of US regulatory changes during the transition period. Allocation of risk during a deal is a big part of transactional lawyering.

It depends on what you mean by part of the original agreement; being an MTB wasn't explicitly mentioned, but complying with all applicable regulations and laws was. If Coinlab had started making good-faith efforts to comply after FinCen guidance or MtGox inquiries into regulatory complaince, that'd be one thing. But, according to the filing, when MtGox asked, Coinlab said we're close enough... So, it effectively became part of the agreement once FinCen announced exchanges would have to register.

Here's how FinCEN interpreted their own rule in 2011:

Agreed; alternative dispute resolution would have probably been a smarter way to go.
