No, it's free and always will be.

The in-browser crypto is considered strong enough, yes.
Being online can be an attack vector if your computer is compromised. One way around this is to use a group vault with multiple co-signers on different machines.

This is correct. 
To manually withdraw, you'd combine the User Key with the Shared Key that you would decrypt using your password.

Coinbase could in theory put a hold on your account. But you can always take the two keys you have and use them manually.
Coinbase can't use the encrypted key. It's encrypted using BIP38 and only you know the password. No way brute-forcing that.

Well, since everything is client-side you can always verify it by looking at the code and inspecting the network requests.

We are planning to update the vaults with the ability to choose a custom time delay. Including 0.

We're trying to keep the footprint small for launch. Will expand to other browsers soon.
@_date: 2014-10-29 22:03:55
Correct. Keep in mind that even if you wouldn't, nobody would be able to touch your coins.
@_date: 2014-07-26 06:46:07
Yes, you need to move the coins from the regular wallet into the Vaut. You can use the 'Transfer Bitcoin' option on your accounts page (

We use multiple HD wallets to create keys at equal indexes and combine those addresses into P2SH multisig addresses.

Yup, same 48 hour withdrawal clearance period.
It is however 0 for group multisig vaults involving multiple parties. Because phishing risks there are much lower.
It is also always possible to bypass the clearance period by manually withdrawing using our open-source recovery tool:

Probably a bug on our side. We'll be working on supporting more browsers very soon.

The shared key is stored encrypted and only the user knows the password. It is there for convenience to enable you to send bitcoin anywhere with just knowing your password.

If you want a long-term storage with multisig that's easy to use, try Coinbase's Multisig Vault solution: 
It's very user friendly and let's you keep control of the majority of the keys (2 of 3).
For peace of mind, there's also an open-source recovery tool that you can always use to recover your coins, in the event that Coinbase would be unavailable.

It's in TypeScript (JavaScript), the code is here

Very nice, you could rename all the CoinbaseExchange variables to Gdax. This was just done with the official Node.js library at
