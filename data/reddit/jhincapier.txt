Split until one of them gets the right features that leads to fulfill the bitcoin promise and leads to widespread adoption. It's called evolution!

The beaming is not for costumers or rural area nodes. The beaming is simply to prevent Man In The Middle attacks, or Eclipse attacks, where an all powerful entity which controls access to internet (say China) want to split the network and control what version of the chain entities under its jurisdiction can see.

Yeah, that's a valid concern. One way to diminish that worry is to focus on alts which value is as independent as possible from bitcoin, such as Dash and ETH. 
The important thing is to realize there is no reason to believe Bitcoin as it is is great. Or that one single group is devs owns the truth. If we really embrace a web approach bitcoin should really be  an open ecosystem, including at the mining/nodea level.
Forks will take us there: either by someone creating a fork with better features and governance, or by forcing the hand of current bitcoin power brokers into agreeing to the changes Bitcoin badly needs.

If the problem is the download time I am sure somebody will be selling the xTB blockchain of BTC, up-to-date, on Amazon on external USB disks. Then the node owner only has to download the few blocks that were created during shipping.

We should not forget that the internet we so much value and love today is the Internet of the tech giants like Google, Facebook, Tencent, Alibaba, etc. This not exactly the Internet the way it was imagined by Vannevar Bush, Ted Nelson, Engelbard, Lee, Metcalfe, et al. That is a lesson that might as well happen again in Bitcoin.

Banks also give mortgages which allow people to buy homes! My point is: relax! Even banks have a role in society!
