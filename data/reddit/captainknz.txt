You're right, I think I read one of your questions out of context.
I thought you were asking if there was a mobile wallet that connected directly to the bitcoin network, without using third party services.

I think this is what breadwallet does -

I think the reason the average joe is starting to wonder what is going on behind the curtain is because the transaction fees are now, on average, higher than they have been in the past.

Did fine on bitcointalk and would probably still be doing just the same as now
There has always been some drama going on to pass the time

The App Store descriptions say it all:
"Breadwallet connects directly to the bitcoin network. This means that there are no servers to get hacked or go down - your funds are always safe. Even if your phone is lost, damaged or stolen, you can easily recover your funds using your personal recovery phrase."

Doesn't segregated witness help fix this sort of problem?
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:31:24
How do you do that?
I've had a few 1 sat/byte transactions stuck awaiting confirmation for weeks now.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:45:42
Isn't it 2 weeks now instead of 72 hours?
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:31:28
Can you link to the sources in regards to issues with Blockchain?
@_date: 2018-06-20 08:09:47
That is not true.
What’s with all the highlighted posts?
That sub has always had that.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:12:27
Is lightning actually available?
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:38:38
They were obviously in a rush, wasn’t it arranged very close to UASF activation?
@_date: 2017-04-11 20:52:39
Simple answer: TX fees and confirmation times are too high

I can't believe more people aren't aware: bitinstant.com takes deposits in the UK :D
There, hopefully the news spreads!

Get the source for the ultraprune branch of bitcoin from github, pay attention to the dependencies and let it download the chain from scratch, it's what you need :)
@_date: 2012-10-06 10:37:09
 have added United Kingdom and have a Bank Transfer option
@_date: 2012-10-11 09:19:59
Or the ultraprune branch of bitcoind
@_date: 2012-05-03 20:10:23
IMO yes, however think for yourself and don't listen to others when making financial decisions.
@_date: 2012-05-23 22:13:39
Yes to all of your questions, with the added bonuses of no transaction fees and only having to wait for 6 confirmations for generation transactions in to your wallet :)

Oops, maybe that isn't what happened this time: 
The Manual Mode is what happened a week ago anyway
@_date: 2012-07-22 03:55:53
To clear up some FUD:
The system does halt trading when it detects orders that are exceptional and have potential to crash the market.
It changes to "Manual Mode" where orders get queued and are still able to be manually processed.
Once the team have sorted what they need to they put it back in to automatic mode and the queue gets processed.

Your username does not inspire confidence, what are you looking for as compensation?

It says how to deal with it at the bottom of the email notification of the withdrawal:
Please contact us as soon as possible by replying to this email if you did not request this withdrawal.

Dear Users,
We would like to officially announce that BitcoinNotify service has been
sold to the CoinExchanger.
CoinExchanger offered the best price, good enough to stop the ongoing
auction immediately.
CoinExchanger expressed the will to keep the service online as it is
(although of course he is not obliged to).
Changing the ownership means that Polish company iVirtuo.com who created
and operated the service until today, is no longer responsible for it.
Also, the official BitcoinNotify.com forum user account will be passed
to the new owner on Monday.
We wish the new owner all the best and hope the service will thrive
under new management!
(this is official announcement by the OLD BitcoinNotify management)
Piotr Włodarek, FORMER  CEO

So keep talking to them, surely there is an issue they need to address.

IMO no merged mining is not killing namecoin at all.
If anything it is strengthening it and raising its awareness.
It is still very early on in both this projects life, and bitcoins life too.

Sorry brah, that was a typo - I meant full nodes.
Have a read of the bitcoin white paper.
