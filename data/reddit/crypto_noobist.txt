I think its important to note that Coinbase is eating the BTC transfer fees to promote GDAX. These fees are PART OF BITCOIN. They are not something that is imposed by Coinbase.
If you are, for example, transferring bitcoin from your own wallet (one you have the private keys for) to your friends wallet, you must pay a transfer fee! 
That fee can be whatever you like, but, if your fee is not high enough, your transaction will sit in the mempool for a long time.
 
The problem is BTC has high fees. Not that the network is slow. If you pay the high fee, your transaction will take maybe 10 minutes.

Plus you can't transact with cash and btc pairs are confusing at first

if your buying with USD in the US, coinbase and GDAX are basically your only option.
dont keep your bitcoin on coinbase. they are not a bank.

People seem to be afraid of alts because they are used to coinbase to buy the bigs. Compared to coinbase, bittrex and poloniex look sketchy and scary.
