That's for dividend stocks. Some stocks do not pay out dividends. 
Bitcoin is used to exchange value with previously unheard of speed and low cost of transactions. The more popular it becomes, the more valuable the units, in this case satoshi/Bitcoin, become.
Bitcoin is also becoming an asset class , similar to gold.

lol i mean, whoever is still in for the long run, unless they have immediate bills to pay, are gonna keep buying even if it hits 250 for some reason. Circle just made it retard-easy to get bitcoin. As soon as high volume, low margin businesses (such as Walmart) realize they can get out of paying 1-3% out of each transaction , they'll start putting out sales in BTC. Watch out this holiday season, they're getting more and more desperate each year, retailers I mean. lol
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:47:19
hmmmmm, drive up the price 100X by selling BTC to major banks as the shares and protocol of a secure and cheap payment system?

"I'm happy to pay 4.4% to PayPal if they help me facilitate easy transactions and connect me with sellers, which is exactly what they do."
Do you work for PayPal or are you just dense? Lol people like you actually enjoy being fucked over like a little bitch because you're too lazy to crawl out of your hole of ignorance. Why do you think Ebay and PayPal are looking to incorporate Bitcoin? So they won't have to charge fucking ridiculous fees for their "safe" and "easy transactions", like when they have to pay fraud insurance. When they do lower their fees and retailers lower prices of their goods because Bitcoin cut down on their expenses and fees, you can thank "dumbasses" like us early supporters, for giving you more bang for your buck. You're welcome you fucking fool. Also yes, if we do it right, escrow services will be close to if not free. You really think Bitcoin is "not taking off" for your dim-witted reasons?
So yeah, shut the fuck up and do your homework first kid.

Holy shit, they should run their credit card systems over the blockchain. Win/win for everyone!
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:31:42
Yeah COIN wouldn't be useful, there are far easier and logical methods, i.e. smartphone.
However, that would be an interesting way of incorporating BTC into the current fiat system. Say you spend a monthly $500 on groceries. So you buy $500 worth of BTC about once a month, that lowers risk of theft or misplacing phones and such. 
With the new ATMS set to go, it wouldn't even be that hard. :)
@_date: 2014-01-20 02:40:00
...The more people using BTC, the higher the price will go as adoption leads to price increases. Supply and demand. Common sense.

It's going really well, sounds like the regulators are getting on board. They're a really sharp bunch.
Bitcoin is a product, (if you don't mind me being metaphorical for a second), of the scientific method. Any logical being can understand that the idea behind it is a paradigm shift. It just takes a while to sink in, that's all. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 09:31:52
um i mean, i plan on buying 5k every month even if it were to sink to 250. It's so cheap right now it's like the whole world went full retard.

@_date: 2014-12-06 06:28:31
um all the coins were bought and there was competition for them. There are two more auctions tba and the usual gang will be there to buy all of them as well. Also, many parties from the last auction banded together in syndicates this time around.

Everyone please calm down. The superintendent of New York state's Department of Financial Services, Benjamin Lawsky (the guy asking most of the questions and swearing everyone in) seems to be a pretty smart guy. They know they are listening to the biased views of everyone involved.
Yes the finance guy from Bitcoin can't comprehend the paradigm shift that Bitcoin is because he is looking at it from his angle, which is to say charts and numbers. The exponential increases in value alone must have blown his poor mind. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 19:59:55

We are confident and arrogant and we do not apologize. Reasons are given below.
1. Economic advantage
Bitcoin is economically advantages for remittance and day to day transactions, while also being a revolution in any business that requires trust. 
2. Vested interests
The federal reserve banksters, the horribly outdated and expensive money transmitting service industry, and the credit card companies that charge an outrageous percentage while propagating a system where your information is kept on file at major retailers waiting for hackers to take them on a whim.
3. [easily] observable advantages
Macy's loses 3% of sales to credit card fees while Kohl's announces it saved a gajillion dollars with bitcoin! 
Oh man, Jose just sent money to his familia in mexico and didn't have to pay like 10% of his below poverty wages to Western Union! 
Oh wow Johnny Sexiness didn't get his credit card information stolen and he uses his sexy iPhone 9000 to pay for everything with the Bitcoin he bought way before it was cool, while here I am in 2020 buying a pack of gum for $100 with my mastercard while the indian guy behind the counter glares at me and tells me the minimum is $500 for credit cards.
4. Conclusion
Seriously man?

@_date: 2015-08-13 03:05:41
what is the ratio of those people vs. the ones who will do something productive with that money? just an honest question, do you know?
@_date: 2015-07-19 05:38:33

@_date: 2015-07-16 06:18:41
Who the hell would accept a zero confirmation transaction before sending product?
@_date: 2015-07-19 06:00:09
nah i think the average joe knows something is wrong, or at least that something's up. Its just going to take a while to wrap their heads around bitcoin, that's all. Standard early/late adopter trends apply dude. Bitcoin is a new technological trend and the smart/curious minds are just getting familiar so far, there's no rush...but when the tsunami does come, oh man.
@_date: 2015-07-18 06:07:40
what else is new
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:03:36
Or the feeling of profits leaving your wallet...
@_date: 2015-07-16 07:13:07
lol the euro is a failure. i feel bad for the germans. i feel bad for them all
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:10:44
Just curious, what happens to coins held by, say, Coinbase or circle
@_date: 2015-07-16 02:04:06
Oh okay, so basically confirmation times are too slow and scammers are taking advantage? 
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:25:38
Ahh greece...The way i see it, they're going down anyway and the referendum won't change anything. 
Vote yes to go down on your knees, pissing in the dust.
Vote no to go out with a roar, heads held high.

Lol, preying on the hookers. Pigs don't have anything else to do?
@_date: 2015-07-11 04:48:22
It has been so boring lately omg
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:08:30
Are you a lender who has to trust you with no collateral on the line? I didn't think so. Do you know how many "well vetted" "borrowers" are defaulting? Arbitration on btcjam is a joke.
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:14:04
And the price has stayed the same, if not gone down. They should publish their real default rates...but if they did, they'd go out of business. Not saying there are not decent honest borrowers on the site but the bad far outweigh the good, and the bad borrowers clearly drag far too many people down, with no real penalties. So by definition, it's a scam.
@_date: 2015-09-03 14:27:04
If they came out and said "YES THE BLOCKCHAIN IS THE ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL AND BTC WILL GO TO THE MOON OUR MODELS PREDICT IT", what do you think will happen to the price? And then how will they accumulate more? Jesus man, are you dense?
@_date: 2015-04-03 06:15:16
No, I think that for companies such as IBM and large institutions such as banks there is a certain [slow] speed in which they have to move, unless it is a time of crisis. These big boys didn't get to where they are by being stupid. Ruthless maybe, but not stupid. If you and I can understand the power of this new technology, then there most definitely are a few individuals at the top who understand it also. They are boiling the frog slowly. Or the sheep rather. So sure, they know they will likely (definitely) fail, trying to use a "blockchain" without BTC rewards, but sure, when it does, they'll have a very public reason to use BTC. They'll be all like "see look we tried, and turns out, this the only way mang. Well time to go off and be rich. Peace out, peasants."

Whether we admit it or not, Mt. Gox was both good and bad for us. Things will settle in due time.
@_date: 2015-09-27 21:57:33
I mean that 
"early-adopter community of anarcho-libertarians... who may be frustrated or disappointed about [increased government oversight of bitcoin]”  
are moving into a different phase too...lol
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:12:38
No doubt, but there is a safe zone if you don't engage in anything stupid. Btcjam borrowers default at all levels. Nothing is guaranteed. There is no collateral. Even worse, btcjam does nothing, just collects their fee and gives out the borrowers info after arbitration. The lenders then have to actually personally find these scammers or just take their loss.

She looks my grandmother's age. She's bound to be a bit confused. Go easy

@_date: 2015-09-03 18:37:27
Who says they're completely lying? Did I ever say that? And no my argument is actually perceptive and intelligent. Worst argument ever? At least I have an original thought while you're just sitting there, all Full Retard. Stop with your drivel and stfu please. Learn to read and think first. 
I hear critical reading and math test scores are at their lowest levels in years for the SAT. You must be one of those morons bringing it down.

Because they are not idiots. There is major brainpower working in big finance and it is a ruthless business. They can't reveal everything, but they drop clues. The battlefield is already being prepared and the pace is quickening.

And im sure the germans had very little vested interest in their currency back then too huh. 
And it's interesting that you get so serious and personal. MY "threadbare rapidly failing funbux" haha so now I'm Satoshi Nakamoto? 
Oh and check out this chart. Educate yourself before you open your ignorant little mouth. Trash. Lawl.

haha interesting comparison, so reddit is my sandwich board? and the internet community is my city? And a two sentence shoutout huh lol. 
oh and you realize inflation is very real right. and fiat/banks/fed. res. has been around much longer than the 50's. Seriously, are you retarded?
Also i find it curious that you said "we're still here". Do you work for a bank, trash?
