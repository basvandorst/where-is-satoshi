what do you mean by you dont take a loss until you sell?
I am sorry but I am new to this and I want to invest right now since I'm pretty sure it is going up back again.If I invest say 100dollars right now and it still goes down like a lot does that mean I still have my money,there is no chance I lose all of them?
I'm trying to play it long term here.
