So.... overall Bitcoin has consistently gone up. But because it cycles up and down like it should... never buy it? I don’t disagree it’s going back below $5k almost immediately in conjunction with the fork.... but it will go back up... it won’t just crash and never go back up.

When you said I do, you did. Whether you think of it like this or not 1/2 of it is hers period. That’s the way it works. When you get a divorce, even if you had Secret loans that the SO did not k ow about it you’re still 50% liable. Tell her the truth, tell her your fears and work it out. If she leaves you because of it she’s a moron and is a bad person. Regardless of if you tell her or not, 1/2 is hers. GL
