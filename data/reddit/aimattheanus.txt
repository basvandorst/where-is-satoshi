Like I said, if you can't wait to buy your new car (really?) you just go to the safe and use the third key.


Use a wallet that's not based in your country, or just use your third key.


Yeah, when Bitcoin becomes a thing I'm not going to be living in a country that can put you in jail for no reason. In fact even though I live in a shit country, I can't be forced to do anything against myself (yay, living here had to have something good!), let alone handle a key.

And yet you have a lot of people doing it, and armies of idiots defending their decision.
Besides I don't know why people here is so eager to defend "day traders". Don't you know that's just gambling? You can't beat trading bots in such a short timeframe. To imply that there are techniques or wisdom to be aquired in that "field" is dumb. The only human day traders that make money are either temporarily lucky, or are selling courses or other bullshit on day trading.

No you don't have to trust them.
If you have to make a large purchase or you decide you want to move everything to a different wallet (eg: If someone shuts down the service) you use the third key, which is in a safe not in your house (you could use your traditional bank for this). It just needs to be inconvenient, to protect you from opportunity attacks like someone breaking into your home.
Or they could let you make bigger purchases if you tell them in advance. Eg: if you are going to buy a car, you tell them 1 week in advance and that day they will sign it.

That's not the reason gold is not used as a currency. Gold has multiple problems due to its physical nature, which Bitcoin doesn't have.
And Bitcoin will not "struggle" just because it's used as an investment or storage of wealth, in fact it's one of its most attractive uses in my opinion. Without the economic incentive almost no one would have bothered using Bitcoin. Why you risk your hard earned money if there isn't a potential reward?
You are not going to convince anyone here by going against Satoshi. If you think you are smarter than him go ahead and create your own inflationary currency like the dogetards did. Just keep in mind that they are the ones that are struggling now. It's all fun and games until you start losing money.

The online wallet holds 1 key and lets you set up a daily limit. When you want to spend coins, you create one signature with the key in your computer, and ask the online wallet to create another signature. They will only sign it if you haven't exceeded your daily limit (they will also use 2FA to protect you against hacking, but that doesn't matter to us in this discussion).
But you don't need to trust them, because they can't run away with your coins. Spending the coins requires 2 signatures.

If you reread the comments, you'll find that I wasn't comparing myself to anyone, just saying that I can't possibly be butthurt after having such success. And it's hilarious to hear different idiots every time a copycoin comes out saying "herp derp, u mad cause u missed the train on Copycoin".
So the one who wanted to compare himself to others was you. Probably to compensate other things...

How many times did you install a wallet, and how many accounts did you create in Bitcoin websites? If the answer is "more than 1", then I rest my case.


Companies say many things. But anyway, like I said, those are accounts, not people. For instance, I have 2 accounts in Coinbase, and never even used the service. I also had 2 accounts in gox, also unused. I usually create an account when the service is launched, realize it's shit and not use it. A year later I might give it another try but I forgot my account so I create a new one, realize it's still shit and not use it. I also installed all of the wallets and tried all the online wallets. I have multiple blockchain.info accounts which I barely use but were kind of useful at times, and I have downloaded and installed Armory at least 10 times (this one is the one I use).

It makes sense because you can't make a global airdrop. Auroacoins might have ended up being worthless after some time, I don't care, but by then everyone there would have learned about Bitcoin. Auroracoin dying so fast is bad news for the crypto world in my opinion. Maybe the next countrycoin can pick a different algorithm and try again, but I doubt it will happen. Having such a small population, the airdrop was actually possible. There aren't many other tiny and highly educated countries out there.

With Bitcoin you can have things that are impossible with fiat. You will have all the features from your old bank, but also a lot more.
See what's coming this year: [Multi-signature](
This will let you create an address that requires 2 of 3 signatures (created using 3 private keys) to spend from it. You could give 1 private key to an online wallet, keep one in your computer, and another one in a safe in a bank. This way the online wallet can't run away with the coins. Someone hacking your computer won't be able to spend them either because they will need the key from the online provider and using the service will require 2FA. If they hack your 2FA they will only be able to spend whatever daily limit you have set. And if someone enters your home, they can't do much either because the other key is in your safe, so at most they could force you to spend the daily limit. If the online wallet is shut down, you can always go to your safe, put your 2 keys together and move the coins somewhere else.
There are already some multi-signature online wallets:
- 
- 
In the future we will have the same but with banks, meaning you won't need to be an expert to be safe. Right now I say you need to be an expert because you still need to verify the code's signature and know when to trust, and/or use the raw protocol with the reference client, but that will obviously change with banks or other local entities you can trust, have insurance, and/or go to the police and/or sue if something goes wrong. But if done right, nothing can go wrong with multi-signature. For instance, I can imagine someone other than the bank building the software or hardware that signs the transaction, so you won't even have to trust the bank's website. The keys should be created separately.

But you are not gonna give any particular examples, right? You are just gonna dismiss them in general, and continue to assume you are right and it's TA's critics the ones who have the burden of proof.
Here's one example, rephrased by me: If TA worked, bots would win every time. Bots only win slightly above 50% of the times. Therefore TA doesn't work. Is there anything you can say about that?

Satoshi solved the Byzantine Generals problem, which is a computer science problem that everyone thought was impossible to solve. And in theory it still is, but the PoW blockchain is a practical solution.
That's why Bitcoin is the first *decentralized* digital currency. Such thing wasn't possible before. For example, gold is decentralized but not digital (so it's inconvenient). E-gold and liberty reserve were digital but not decentralized (so they got shut down easily by the government). Bitcoin is both.

Bitcoin is not a company, it's a protocol. See what happened with TCP (internet), HTTP (web), SMTP (email). They aren't the best protocols but never got replaced because they are good enough and adoption is everything.

@_date: 2014-04-10 17:59:42
- They will still charge 1%
- They will still keep all unclaimed coins, instead of returning them to the sender.
- The truth is you can't know what they will do with your data, no matter what they say now. And we already know their original intentions, so...

The fact that you don't realize that when we say that dogecoin fell we mean it fell in BTC (not dollars) is hilarious.
If BTC goes down in USD and you say it's "not doing well", then dogecoin is doing horribly.
But we already knew dogetards weren't smart... Just look at OP, storing his unencrypted paper wallets in multiple places for other people to steal them, lol.
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:27:37


You mean the attacker will stay in your home for a week? Or go with you to the safe? That's how they get caught.


It is more secure.
Your bank can run away with your money. Law enforcement can seize it. The government can seize it. A multi-signature wallet can't. Someone holding your third key can't either (it could even be encrypted).
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:45:11
Too late to be useful, a lot more people knows about Bitcoin now, and multi-signature wallets are starting to pop up. Why would you want your coins to be vulnerable to a physical attack like breaking into your home and putting a gun to your family's head? You should require from Bitcoin the same level of security or higher than you ask from you bank. This can be achieved with multi-signature wallets.
@_date: 2014-04-01 00:11:41
It's a good idea, but make sure to also spend $200 in a cheap laptop for cold storage if you don't have one, else your investment will either be insecure or inconvenient. With an offline laptop for signing the transactiosn you can have both convenience and security.
The best is yet to come, with multi-signature wallets/banks. But for now an offline laptop with Armory is perfect.

If the coins are already distributed (which is the hard part to achieve in a PoS coin), and you find out that PoS is actually good enough, you could add PoS, tell the miners to go fuck themselves and the network would remain secured. So I doubt they would reject changing PoW for PoS or a hybrid. Besides lots of miners are also heavy holders, and some of them could profit even more.

Except Satoshi compared it to gold, and knew very well you could use it to get rich. In one of the first discussions, Satoshi, Hal Finn and many others discussed what a big opportunity it was to buy some coins so cheap, considering Bitcoin could take over the world and the price of each coin could go to the moon. Seems like you are the one who knows very little about Bitcoin.

Huh? People talked about Bitcoin's price since the beginning. See the initial conversations between Satoshi, Hal Finney and others. They knew if Bitcoin became popular it would be worth a lot.

If they don't offer anything new and good, I'm not gonna watch them because they don't interest me. Bitcoin offered all kinds of new and great things, so it interested me right away. Changing the algorithm to scrypt isn't interesting in my opinion. Neither is adding a cute dog picture.

Etherum shills will try to sell it to you by saying things like "turing-complete!", because complete things are better, right? Nope. Satoshi made the Bitcoin's script system turing-incomplete on purpose. So keep that in mind before buying into their scheme, because apparently they have spent more time thinking about how to market a premined (40%) coin without being called a scam, than any technical matters. Any criticism will make them rage hard, and here come the downvotes.

It's a tradeoff of security / fault tolerance vs speed and energy efficiency.
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:48:23


Only trolls/shills will bash you for that, and you should be proud.
Something I think is really important and no one ever mentions, is the fact that Bitcoin's creator solved a problem of computer science that everyone thought was impossible:


In layman terms, we can now have a decentralized consensus on which transactions are valid and which ones aren't, so we don't need to trust a central authority for the bookeeping anymore, freeing us from all kinds of problems like inflation, excessive fees, account freezings, etc.

A 51% attack can't magically destroy the most adopted coin, it would just disrupt the network for a while. We could add PoS at any time, or use other countermeasures. Shitcoins on the other hand, simply die.

Less money is worse than more money. Hard to understand?
@_date: 2014-04-06 04:01:44
If PoS turned out to be good it could be added to Bitcoin later on, so I wouldn't put money in any altcoin that is just playing around with the concept. Maybe you are not aware of this but many of these altcoins are created by the same persons, and people just keep throwing money at them. I don't even bother reading about altcoins anymore, but if I remember correctly, the creator of Peercoin created others as well. There was a list of cryptocurrencies and their creators, but I can't find it now.

You don't need them to actually hold your bitcoins. You just need someone to hold one of the 3 private keys from your multi-signature wallet. Sure, on top of that they can have insurance or whatever. But you should rely on cryptography first. No one should be able to run away with your coins.

@_date: 2014-04-05 23:27:57
Ever heard about powers of ten units? Eg:
1 BTC = 1000mBTC = 1000000uBTC
You do the same with gold or any other thing:
1g = 1000mg = 1000000ug
No need to create a new stupid coin for that.
@_date: 2014-04-14 00:14:11
There are lots of ways it can degrade. I remember when I was a kid I "laminated" a piece of paper that was important to me, using scotch tape. After a few days the ink disappeared as if someone had used one of those magic erasers that can erase ink from paper.
I've heard temperature and many other factors can do the same to your paper wallet.

They weren't smart, they didn't fix the price high. They fixed it in BTC, so the price fluctuates with it.

He asked for donations for improving the forum (bitcointalk.org), people donated 6000 BTC, he kept them, the forum got hacked, and now the forum is troll central. What's worse, when we were at $1000 and the coins were worth millions, the asshole said he was going to spend them all in the forum, which is obviously retarded and people didn't want that anymore. Who the hell spends millions in a forum? Not even an idiot. So he's obviously going to launder all that money through some software company and keep it for himself.
Every time something new comes up, the asshole asks for more donations. Can you believe he asked for donations to support Coinjoin? Coinjoin devs like gmaxwell said they received too little, something like 20-30 BTC. Fucking theymos could have used some of the 6000 BTC to support Bitcoin developments like Coinjoin, instead he kept them "for the forum" (which is still unusable).

The point is redditors and many other subgroups in the internet seem to *love* to have a few links to use as wildcard to answer any question without needing to think. I suspect they also feel really smart and educated, like every time someone says something remotely related to passwords, someone will invariably post some old xkcd comic. Not that you are one of those, but you were definitely wrong in pointing out Hanlon's Razor. I know stupidity is more likely than malice, but this is not the case, and to imply that it is, even as a joke, is harmful in my opinion. It's about time people open their eyes and realize that maybe malice isn't *that* uncommon, or at least that it's not evenly distributed. I'm pretty sure evil (or emotionless) people have collectivelly a lot more power than normal people, and can pull things like what OP suspects and Snowden and many others confirmed.

Your online wallet keeps 1 key, you keep 1 key in your computer, and another one in a safe in the bank or whatever, somewhere you can't access right away. You need 2 of 3 signatures to move the coins. Your online wallet has daily and monthly limits. If someone breaks into your home, you can only give him what your daily limit allows you, just like an ATM doesn't allow you to take all your funds.
@_date: 2014-04-11 21:42:38
It doesn't matter what they are. If you are on a multi-signature scheme you are safe. You own your coins.
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:59:53
As long as someone like gmaxwell reviews the cryptographic part, I don't think there can be a problem. I mean the spending of your bitcoins already depends on a script and a cryptographic proof. Wouldn't recovering your coins from the sidechain be something similar?


Any changes to the code can introduce exploits. I don't know what's so special about side-chains that makes you think they will be so exploitable.
Why oppose side-chains, but not every other change?


Damn right! :p
I doubt we can lose more coins to side-chains than to all the other causes, like paper wallets. This has never been a problem.
If we thought deflation could be an economic problem we would be using dogecoin or another shitcoin, not Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-04-06 20:05:23
You misspelled "forced to use".

@_date: 2014-04-06 05:16:17
I didn't call it bad, but I definitely think it's not enough reason to create yet another coin, especially since it's only extra feature could be added to Bitcoin (even if it was hard to do). People said it was hard to add anonymity to Bitcoin, and that was the argument for Zerocoin. But now after a lot of work we have CoinJoin and Stealth Address implemented for Bitcoin.

With Coinbase, you don't really own your coins. You are just trusting that Coinbase will give them to you when asked.
With multi-signature done right, you own your coins and are completely safe. I haven't used BitGo, but a 2-of-3 multi-signature online wallet is supposed to let you set up daily limits. This way, even if someone hacks your 2FA *and* your computer, you won't lose much, just the daily limit.
@_date: 2014-04-04 00:38:06
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:46:27
Only virtual things apparently. We can't spend more than $200 **per year** to import stuff.
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:21:46
This is not entirely true though. Multi-signature wallets greatly improve Bitcoin's security for the normal person. If done right, the most you could lose is your daily limit. Watch this video if you haven't already:
@_date: 2014-04-06 09:16:35
Except you can't, and that's the whole point.
For instance, could you take all your money out of your bank account when someone breaks into your home at night? Nope. With multi-signature you could have the same level of security or even better.
@_date: 2014-04-04 01:59:41
The fact that all those improvements were be made to Bitcoin? Ok.
@_date: 2014-04-12 17:44:19
You are being fallacious here and you know it.
You are implying that my reasoning was "They denied doing it, therefore they must be doing it". While there wasn't actually any reasoning on my part, I was simply pointing out the flaw in *your* reasoning. You basically said "They denied it, therefore they must not be doing it", which is simply stupid since fucking shit up and lying is their main function and they have all the protections needed to do so, and in any case there is more than enough evidence against them so that you can't ever trust them again.
@_date: 2014-05-18 09:29:15
Thank you genius, but that's not a problem you can solve. A much more realistic approach would be to use three different setups to generate the keys and then use them to create a multi-signature address.
@_date: 2014-04-10 09:44:54

Well too bad because like I said, no one will fall for that.

I find it quite annoying how Americans are always worried about what happens to "American citizens". What if I'm American but for some reason don't have citizenship? Or what if I'm "just" a human being?
I'm sure you didn't mean it that way, but I still needed to point it out. Probably the media and the education system are responsible for making Americans talk like that. That way it's easier to wage wars, because Americans get used to only care about American citizens.
@_date: 2014-04-01 19:59:26
Interesting, but you can't deny nowadays it's mostly a US-only thing. Sure, some Mexicans and Europeans might join them, but that's it.

You are having a hard time following a logic reasoning, I'll try one last time:
Protocols that are good enough and reach critical mass (of adoption) succeed and are rarely or never replaced.
SMTP, TCP, and HTTP were protocols that were good enough and were never replaced.
Bitcoin is also a protocol that is good enough. So I say Bitcoin won't be replaced, because it has already reached critical mass.
Gopher and telnet were obviously not good enough, and were replaced as expected.
@_date: 2014-04-14 00:19:10

In this context, bubble doesn't mean that the price is higher than it should as KIND_DOUCHEBAG is saying. We call bubble to every time the price goes up ~x10 (the price goes up because of more infrastructure, hashing power, new blood, good news, etc.), and crash every time it goes down to ~1/2 (the price goes down because it went up too much due to the media hype, and we also call this a correction. So the rise is not really a bubble, and the halvening is not really a crash).

I picked 3 protocols that were good enough and succeeded.
And you tried to counter by pointing out two protocols that weren't good enough, and obviously didn't succeed.
Edit: In case you still don't understand it: What you should have done is point out protocols that were good enough but didn't succeed.

Same if it goes higher. And we already know it can't go much lower than this, but it can go a lot higher than this. Making sure to buy everything at ~460 is a great idea IMO.

He didn't use the coins, the forum got hacked, then he claimed to be a great manager when the price went up. People told him to use those thousands of coins for more important things instead like supporting CoinJoin or other Bitcoin developments or marketing campaigns. He refused, he asked for *more* donations for CoinJoin and offered himself to be the holder of the coins, CoinJoin devs complained that they only had like 20-30 coins, but thankfully they developed it anyway because unlike Theymos they are great people. Theymos said he would spend all the coins (worth millions of dollars at the time) in building a custom forum software (wtf??) because he is such a responsible guy that he would use all the coins for what they were intended to be used originally. He mentioned a couple times he would give the money to some "software development company". So he will basically launder all the coins through this company and keep them for himself. He also continues to do shady things like buying the wiki from Karpeles and [fucking up the links]( Some of those links have been posted all over the internet and were a great resource for newbies, but the idiot won't fix them.
