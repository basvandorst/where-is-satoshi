I can of course, but the question is, if I'd like to create a paper wallet, if it's safe to do it this way with Electrum.
@_date: 2018-09-16 13:36:39
Thanks for the Tails suggestion. I think I will try to run Tails in a virtual machine (without networking), guess that would also be safe.

The dates in order of the references from the Bitcoin whitepaper are:
    19981101 199905 1991 1993 199704 20020801 198004 1957
What if the lengths of these dates represent words to create a sentence?
For example: 19981101 could be one of these words:
    abstract
    announce
    document
    frequent
    interest
    multiply
    physical
    possible
    security
    solution
    strategy

Hmm. I can not go to Binance and get a mortgage or a loan. So we still need financial third parties like banks.
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:48:01
Note: there is also 2008 in the picture, which is not in the references but may be part of it. I'm wondering why it is 2008 and not 20081031. Because 2008 probably refers to the date (31 October 2008) the whitepaper was published.

If all BIP39 words with the same angle/degrees would be pairs inside the circle, I get this list:
    0 degrees = ability* attack end fee* find know now post problem proof sign since stay
    30 degrees = air define else open main* split* use*
    60 degrees = agree cash early gap modify next order pool race* rely run zero
    -30 degrees = issue just must one online power provide* trust tail* want way*
    -60 degrees = able almost code easily law model risk try
Words with an asterisk* are the ones inside the Bitcoin symbol.
My brain is also frying now.

Agreed. I like how Nick Szabo explains it in [this]( video (57:04-58:45).

I think you're replying to the wrong person here. I'm very much aware of the advantages of Bitcoin. But thanks anyway :-)
I was actually replying to a comment of newer coins claiming to be faster and having more transactions, which is not imporant because these are mostly centralised.
@_date: 2018-10-14 06:23:05


Not everything is a scam. Those of which claim to be the next global currency, I mostly ask myself: What does this alt coin do what Bitcoin does not?
Some alts, for example Ripple and Stellar, are faster but these have the same characteristics as the current real world payment systems. They are owned by a company/foundation and act more like a centralised (database) ledger. It does not mean these coins are scams, just that the fundamentals or goals are different than what Bitcoin is.
For a global currency/system without a trusted third party, security and decentralization have the highest priority. Speed and transactions can be added or fixed later.
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:59:26
Ah, not nice that you had terrible experiences. Switching away from Bitcoin, I can understand that from a business point of view. I hope Lightning Network will make that up in the near future.

Email or actually Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Application Layer on top of the TCP layer. In its core, it is still much the same as it was back in the days. However, extended features have been added later, like STARTTLS for SSL/TLS connections. An email also exists of two standards: [SMTP]( (the envelope) and the actual [Message]( (the letter).
It's a bit off-topic but just to show that security extensions have been added later to email. So it was not perfect when it was invented but it has been improved over time.

The decimal numbers could be related to the BIP-0039 words. There are 2048 words, so a few of the above decimals are not in that list. 
There is also a number "16" at the right corner of the table. Could be a 12 word seed + 4 extended custom words.

That's some real f*ck my life example! I can feel you a little. I bought 1 BTC in 2013, had to sell it in 2016 with loss because I needed the money that time. Then 2017 came along. :-/

Don't stare yourself blind on partnerships. Bitcoin does not have partnerships. Gold has no partnerships. If the fundamentals and tech is good, it does not need these partnerships to grow or to have value.
@_date: 2018-10-13 20:43:45


Yeah, I suppose Ethereum will continue fine even without Vitalik. I would only wonder how they will select the next leader, if that's even required. Probably by using on-chain voting?


These are just to give some examples. Not really comparisons. Gold is a good example because the fundamentals of Gold and Bitcoin simply have many similarities. 


The Unix philosophy is: "Do One Thing and Do It Well". I couldn't agree more here with you. ;-) 


That would be nice, of course. It will also bring new problems, like storing data "forever" on a blockchain. This could work both ways, good and bad.


Monero (XMR) is a very interesting project. If no privacy extensions will be added to Bitcoin (core or sidechain), Monero will grow much bigger the next years.
Interesting times for sure.
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:48:18
Fair enough. I still believe it is possible to add many improvements on the Bitcoin network (different layers) instead of inventing the new/next Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:25:17


Email is almost 50 years old. We're still using that today. Not perfect but good enough.
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:23:29


In my opinion, increasing the blocksize should not be the first solution to the speed/transaction issue. It (temporary) prevents people from searching and implementing better solutions.
I also think it is bad because it requires miners/nodes to have more disk space and faster internet connections. This will result in a smaller network (less nodes), which reduces the overall security of the network. If you store your money in this technology, security should be the first concern, not speed.
That's how I see it but it's ok to have different opinions. ;-)
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:37:39


It also depends in what the "believer" of the coin is looking for. With Bitcoin, many people want to have a decentral and secure coin. Which can not simply be destroyed or shutdown by any government. Secure and decentral should therefore be the first concern.
Visa/Mastercard/PayPal etc. are already fast and (relatively) cheap. If speed and max transactions is what you're looking for, central databases/ledgers already exist for decades.
@_date: 2018-10-13 20:01:12


Email can be secure if you have your own domain, run your own mailserver and use PGP/GPG to encrypt your mails. However, in the real world, that's way too much hassle or too complicated for average users.
It is more secure because with PGP/GPG you own your private keys and you're not relying on a trusted third party. With chat apps like Whatsapp/Telegram/Signal, you trust their "end-to-end" encryption.
@_date: 2018-10-13 20:55:08
Indeed! Totally agree. I like how Nick Szabo explains it in [this]( video (57:04-58:45).
@_date: 2018-10-13 18:28:32
Privacy is a good point indeed. I think there are some ideas or proposals for MimbleWimble on a sidechain of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:12:27


Very good point! Maybe we need to think more in owning mBTC or even Satoshis.
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:19:56
Ethereum is definitely an interesting project with a great community. I'm following this project also. At this moment however, there are many theoretical promises like: casper, sharding, reducing block rewards, setting a cap on the total supply. Lots of uncertainties, if you ask me.
It also looks like Vitalik is some sort of CEO of the project. That does not make it bad, actually, some people like it more that there is some leader involved. For me personally, I prefer the way Bitcoin has no leader (well Satoshi, but s/he disappeared).
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:55:07


I never tell them what is right or wrong. :-) I only like to explain why security and decentralised should be their first concern. Like if Ripple would ever become to big that it becomes a threat for the government, they will either be forced to cooperate or will get shutdown. Now that's not something I prefer to put my money into.
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:36:26


I guess so. At least on the short term. In the longer term, 5-10 years, I'm not so sure.


Totally agree with you!
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:35:24


The people I talk about here already chose to invest/store some fiat into cryptocurrencies. Why store it in some high risk coin/token which does not do anything new than what Bitcoin is already doing. I know Bitcoin is not prefect (yet), but it is good enough.

FastMail was founded in 1999. When Outlook was still Hotmail and 5 years before Gmail was born.


Yes, of course it affects me. It was a nice-to-have feature, being able to pay with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:44:45
It is an alternative for Gmail and Outlook where “you” are not the product.
@_date: 2019-02-21 19:43:27
ProtonMail does not use IMAP/SMTP standards. They use their own closed source app for mobile and some kind of TLS wrapper/stunnel (Bridge) for desktops. I prefer to use (open) standards when it comes to security and mail.
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:08:32
That’s right. That is also why i posted this.
For example: if there would be 10 extreme large mining companies (so not pools) which would ‘together’ have 51% or more of the hashrate, then they could be bought and/or forced by governments to cooperate.
Well, i guess that won’t ever happen anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:50:09
Fantastic explained! Great job!

Don’t take it too literally. They just do explain the fundamentals very well. :-)
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:41:17
In that case we need some sort of hybrid PoW+PoS solution. :-)

I’m also buying a small amount every week (dollar cost averaging).
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:48:13
So as long pools are bigger (have more hashrate) than a single mining farm/company, it should be fine. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:24:44
It is already a world currency if you compare it with existing currencies. Other currencies all rely on a “trusted” third party, like local banks and governments. Bitcoin does not.
Bitcoin is internet money (value) for the world run by people from everywhere in the world. I’m not sure if it will ever replace any currency but it’s another great way to transfer value all around the world without a trusted third party.

What's the difference between using paper for a private key or a seed? Aren't they both equally dangerous? For pure holding/storing (not spending) I believe a private key is just as safe as a seed.
The point of failure is "paper". A better way to store your keys or seed is: [Cryptosteel](
