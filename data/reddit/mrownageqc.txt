With YouTube, I had made over 12,000$ USD before the age of 16. I was getting monthly direct deposits of well over a thousand dollars every month. In my head, it was never going to stop coming in so I spent my money like an idiot. Sure, I built myself a nice computer, I paid myself some nice vacations in Cuba and more, but I never saved any of it or did anything else with it than spend it. It was all fun and games until I received two (bullshit) copyright claims in two days, shutting down my channel. 
That was all back in 2011-2012, one of my friend was heavily into Bitcoin and loved the idea and concept. He himself had quite a lot, which he ended up using on SilkRoad to buy hallucinating cactus for about 6 or 7 BTC. To this day, he *still* brings it up and how that cactus wasn't worth 60,000+ dollars. 
He spent a lot of time trying to convince me to even invest a small 1,000$ into BTC and sit on it. Back then it wouldn't have been much and it would have been worth it ! But I didn't personally believe in it. I kind of regret it nowadays ! 
But what I've been told is that you can't just keep looking back at "what *could* have happened", because if you do this, you'll go crazy at every mistakes you made. LEARN from the past instead. Which is now why I am heavily involved in Monero (XMR) nowadays with both mining and investing.

I would personally wait, just a bit, to see if it would come down, because over the past 7 days, it jumped from 150$ USD up to 250$ USD, which is really incredible in my opinion. It still is definitely mineable if this is something you would like to do !

With so many darknet markets doing exit scams, how do we know it *isn't* one of those ?
No authorities would go after them. They could as well have decided to cash out and fuck everyone over.

It was more of a shameless plug, since I gave my point of view as someone who missed the Bitcoin train, I really believe in Monero, just as much as I believe in Bitcoin to become more and more popular and widely accepted.

Wait, it's the Winklevoss' creation ?

*"Consider, the snake.."*
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:23:30
Yeah, been reading reviews for the last 10 minutes, needless to say that I should have read those before sending my Bitcoins there ! I mean, I hate websites like that.. 
*"Hey, want to transfer your money here ? No problem ! Oh, you want to withdraw that money ? Nope, verify your account first !"*
@_date: 2014-01-23 15:50:16
Did you send the same type of documents as me ? (Driver license and receipt)
@_date: 2014-11-29 05:50:31
I had 3.29$ worth of BitCoins left. Gave it to to someone in the subreddit I go the most ! :)
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:16:01
I now regret sending all my Bitcoins (+/- 100$) to that website, should have kept them in my local wallet. Thanks for the answer !
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:08:28
They still owe me 0.3 BTC, they're in my account, which is "being verified" for the last 3 months..
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:15:03
Yeah, tell that to my account that hasn't been "Verified" after 4 months of waiting.. They let you transfer all your bitcoins in your MtGox account, but you have to forever to actually do something. They say "Up to 10 days". Contacted their "support", never got a single response..

If I have +/- 30$ in Bitcoin, and I want to buy something that costs, 50$, can I pay 30$ in Bitcoins and pay the rest with PayPal ? 
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:48:39
So far, every 3-4 months I receive a little piece of paper, similar to a post card, with Mt.Gox written on it. When you open it, everything is written in Japanese except the word *"Bankrupt"*. I have no idea what those means, but have my name and address written on it. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:43:11
I'll try to find one, I kept one out of curiosity.
*Everything* was in Japanese except the word *"Bankrupt"*.
Mailed to my name and address
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:35:00
Fair enough, and I don't blame you, don't worry about it. And sorry you lost so much :(
I have a question though, I keep receiving mail from Mt.Gox, pretty much small piece of paper in Japanese, but I have no idea what they mean, I received 4 so far. Any clues as what they are ?
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:26:12
I still lost around 250$, while this is way less than most people, it still hurts a student's budget.

@_date: 2013-12-06 02:10:42
Wow! You're a much nicer person than I am ! :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:49:17
Made a post there. Thanks !
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:13:09
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:12:31
Or he's just a really nice person !

Dude, I can't find 12.11 **NON-BETA** drivers.. 12.11 seems to only be a  beta driver....
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:22:47
You're awesome ! I'd donate without hesitation, but my god damn MtGox account is still under verification after 14 days... so I can't send money.. :/ 
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:20:10
Wel.. now I get **[this error..]( I have absolutely no idea why..
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:06:06
Yeah, but when I downgraded my Drivers to 12.1, I get the "guiminer.exe has stopped working error"...
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:48:58
True, I'll probably think about it before buying.
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:41:24
So I figured out what was causing the problem of the "guiminer.exe has stopped working". It is the 12.11 Drivers. Now I am back with my original problem, *"Verification failed, check hardware!"*
