I don't think it is as simple as you imply.  To attack p2pool during this fork, one would need to:
1) Prevent 95% of the nodes from upgrading their software (sybil attack to create +5% nodes with old software, maybe)
2) Submit mining work to p2pool on the old sharechain while maintaining the sybil attack to keep the upgraded node percent under 95%.
Maybe I am missing something, but what would be the motivation to do this?  The miner would still only get paid for their portion of (invalid) work.  Everyone else would still get paid, although it would be slightly less because of the payments to the invalid shares.
(BTW, P2Pool is not "mine", it was written by [forrestv]( as an open-source project, and my only involvement is as admin of a [node]( and some web services related to p2pool)

Miners don't need to change any software, but the nodes they connect to will need to upgrade.  Often the node operator is the miner with p2pool, but not always, and vice-verse.
@_date: 2015-06-22 07:30:48
I thought some people might be interested in seeing real time transaction counts, block sizes, etc. from a full node, if they aren't able or willing to run their own.  It seemed topical, with the recent discussions on blocksize and node counts and such.
I clearly forgot about the downvote troll patrol on My bad.
@_date: 2015-06-23 03:02:37
[bitcoin.conf]( for the core client can include settings that alter the relay transaction fee requirements, blockmaxsize, and kb allocated for free and/or high priority transactions.






blockmaxsize may be actually set lower than the default by miners (this example shows set to max of 1MB) to reduce propagation time for new blocks.  Any fee less than the "minrelaytxfee" setting is considered a 'free' transaction for purposes of including in new blocks, I believe.  The 'limitfreerelay' setting tells bitcoin how much of the block space to reserve for free and/or high priority transactions, so setting to 1 basically provides little to no room for 'free' transactions.
These, among other tactics, such as outright blocking connections to certain nodes and ip ranges that relay transactions the miner doesn't want to handle.
At least that is my understanding, I might be off a little on some techniques and details.
@_date: 2015-06-28 06:32:08

There are public nodes which run both the core full node and the p2pool service, some for free, some for fee.  It is possible to mine for p2pool without running a full bitcoin core node and/or a p2pool node by pointing a miner at one of these nodes.

Importing or sweeping these keys with a web wallet like blockchain.info is likely futile.  But that isn't stopping people from trying, of course.
The successful transactions are likely very high fee relative to the output, and were probably generated and signed by someone running a full node, or a script that can automate much of the process through API calls.  Even if the transaction gets broadcasted, it may not propagate or ever be confirmed (hence the huge mempool).  Most of the block explorers are showing double digit numbers of transaction conflicts (ie double spends) for the addresses related to these transactions.
tldr; not worth the time, probably won't work, unless you really know what you're doing AND and very lucky.  the more people that try it, the more mempool spam created.
