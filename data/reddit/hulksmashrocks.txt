I think he is right in saying that deflationary is bad. I think Bitcoin should not be so deflationary in another 15 years. The idea I posed would actually offset some of that deflation and maybe keep it at a balance, never inflating or deflating too much for too long =/
Yes I think it is important not to change things mid-point either. Even my idea is fairly complex for what Bitcoin is supposed to be. It's quite possible this will never even be a problem but I like extrapolating.

I think Bitcoin is one of those technologies that you will be able to follow with some amount of interest almost always, even though the early early phase is over, the entire saga is just beginning.
Monetary-wise, oh man yeah I wish I had gone with my gut at ~$5 in 2011, but we live and learn.
Bitcoin definitely is something that more tech-/economic-oriented people would keep an eye one, and it stands to suggest that Bitcoin will grow along with the tech- infrastructure that holds it up. No doubt persons with more tech-/econo- background will pick up on the trends and meanings behind Bitcoins movements more so than the average consumer/investor.
The best way I think anyone can become involved with Bitcoin is to simply use it whenever you can, whenever its advantages outweigh the disadvantages in a particular scenario, and to network with others using it so that the disadvantages can be made clear and a solution can be worked towards. I don't need to say this since it is what has been going on since 2009, but I think it's important to remember that Bitcoin and its community is as strong as its tech, and the tech is maintained in one way or another by the same community.
I'm sure that in 2009 very few people actually could predict anything like what has happened since. It took/takes a very strong and patient mind to have held coins over the last 5 years, but the payoff has proven almost unimaginable to those interested in the monetary gain (Hell I will take +100,000% over 4 years any day)
While we might have missed the starters gun, we have not missed the race! :)

I don't think BTC is working as a store of value for most is that most are still valuing things in USD/EUR/CNY but pricing in BTC, so of course when BTC/USD goes down, that will be interpreted as a loss of value, even if you command the same number (or more!) of BTC. Once customers/merchants/traders begin hanging onto BTC long enough so that at the time of them spending it, it holds approximately the same value as it did when they received it, will it become more useful as a store of value. Bubbles based on hype and speculation don't contribute to that scenario, and may be another reason why most don't see it as a good store of value right now; any holders in the red right now bought in the last year, and bubbles are where most of the buyers are located.
The thought process can't be "This sandwich could sell for $5 so I'll charge *uhh, calculator, etc* 3.5 mBit". It has to be more like "I can live on ~400 mBits per month and cost of sandwich is 2 mBit so I'll charge 3.5 mBit". It seemed to me like there was a good amount of BTC-economy type startups, especially around a year ago. They also seemed to target rich customers who won in the bubble, acting as another middleman in BTC/USD transactions, and it's no surprise they too died with BTC price. I think we need more of these startups, like MOAR!!! They stabilize the BTC economy in some way, and as more join it offers structure for others to fall into place as well. At the moment the price/value is being traded to death, and who knows where it might end up, so until either the price stops jumping around so much, or majority of users quit basing things in fiat, I don't see it being feasible.

Most (if not all) market charting sites (such as bitcoinwisdom.com) allow you to adjust the time interval/range of what you're looking at. Some may have a monthly option (1m), although usually the largest I've seen with BTC is 3d or 1w. I think a reason for this may be that BTC is still 'new' to the markets and 1m candles would make for a pretty short chart. 
Using the 3d or 1w should be fine though as you can then see even more than a simple monthly average; monthly minimum/maximum, as well as price/volume over the 30 days in that month, which provides much more intel than a single number can.

Mine those alts, stockpile them and watch their trade rates closely! Whenever one of them spikes from some pump/dump thing or whatever, trade them to BTC and either hodl on or buy back the alt when it falls again, rinse repeat etc. If you trade consistently and with smarts, you can multiply your gains quite a lot, but obviously it's not as easy as it might seem. Good luck :)

I am used to people using the full 'bitcoin' when describing 1.00 BTC, and while 'bits' to describe µBits (in my mind) was weird at first but now seems quite natural. [BTC, mBits, bits, satoshis] seems to work well enough. The other/metric prefixes are still useful for describing more precise amounts though.
@_date: 2014-11-04 10:41:36
holy moley!
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:50:40
It's a tad confusing. I think when 'bit' is used solo, it means 100 satoshi a.k.a. 'microbit' or 'µbit'
But with the prefix milli- attached, the 'bit' is short for Bitcoin, making it 1/1000th of a BTC.

You mean digital data? The video and sound is analog data and the Very High Frequency band is probably suited to them or who knows why they chose that range... You could transmit digital data (1s and 0s) on the same lines but I think lower frequencies use less energy as well. Radio waves encompass VHF and much more :)

I think the body camera issue is pretty separate from Bitcoin, but they invigorate similar parts of my brain to action :)
I am of the opinion that if implemented fairly, they could be very useful in stopping unnecessary escalation of many situations where police interact with civilians. It's no secret that many members of the police force will absolutely abuse innocent civilians either physically or not, if they believe they are not being watched and can get away with it. This is what they are PAID to do at this point, essentially. The more arrests they make, the more armored trucks get sent their way.
It's also no secret that plenty of civilians have begun recording police forces anywhere they can. This is one of our constitutional rights. We as civilians need to make it known that we are watching for shenanigans and WILL raise a shit storm if we see shenanigans. Unfortunately this has led to innocent cameramen often becoming a target due to the fact that they hold incriminating evidence on their camera/phone/thingy and some police don't like that. What I notice though is that there is a much higher chance of a specific officer being held personally accountable (I'm big on this) for their actions when there is an independent record of the situation. If this would further be helped by putting cams on the officers themselves, so be it! I see it more as a reaction by them at this point; "Oh you civvies want to record us? We'll have our copy too then!" 
Really it's only fair. Civilians make a point of saying "I am audio and video recording" and suddenly they have a *small* hand up over the officer. The officer may as well say "me too" and then we are back on even ground, so to speak.
I think this is great, as long as the footage from these officers is actually made public and reviewed fairly in the event of something potentially wrong going down. If a cop shoots some guy and his chest cam shows the guy was doing nothing wrong, that officer should be ENDED. Like DONE. But it's great if the video can show that the guy was actually pulling a gun of his own and that the officer acted in self-defense, clearing him of wrongdoing. Every video shot from an officers chest should have his name and badge number permanently displayed in the video, so there is no question of who did what.
The only thing I wonder about here is... If more police start carrying these cameras and become known for cleaning up their game because they know they are being watched, will that cause the general population to relax? Will people stop recording these situations on their own based on the knowledge that "there is a camera already on that cop"? This could be bad if it ends up that ALL footage is coming from the officer cameras, as once again it opens the door to abuse and a judge saying "the footage was determined to be non-deterministic and it's also top-secret hurr hurr". I see it as no different from the cameras on police car dash-boards; they are RARELY used to incriminate an officer, because the footage belongs to, well, the Police. If chest-cams become a widespread thing, civilians should NOT stop recording police activity!!!
Hmm I could rant a bit more on so many things here but that's my general view of the subject.
@_date: 2014-11-13 11:29:47

I propose the 'ideal' state of things but in reality the real value of BTC has yet to really be determined and as such it will be crazy volatile for awhile yet. My personal opinion as a dog on the internet is that in ~10-15 years we might start to built actual stability in the value of BTC, assuming historical growth patterns and timescales continue, and nothing too crazy happens before then that might make/break BTC immediately. Maybe more time than that though, and also maybe less.
@_date: 2014-11-23 10:16:20
Yeah try not to jump the gun, it makes for losses in trading. But also don't wager too much of your stock on any one position. I don't like to commit more than 10-15% of my total on any trade, and I set stops to keep me from losing more than 1% of my total on any one trade. Combine this with good TA and unemotional decision making and you can make money. But I can't say I've done well doing this. I'm about breaking even as of late, but hey at least it's not losing a bunch!

Not to poop on your parade, but what benefit does this service provide actually? Besides taxing me 5% on every purchase needlessly... 
If I run out of $$ and have BTC, I'll sell my own BTC and then use the $$ to buy something. And in that case I'm not actually 'buying' anything with BTC at all, it just becomes yet another forex trade that winds up using dollars again. I believe BTC economy will not thrive until it actually becomes detached from the fiat currencies and people start valuing products/services in BTC regardless of what the BTC/USD price is...

¥/€/$ is still too easy to use for most people, and the banks still have enough control to keep people happy and oblivious to the situation. Credit/debit fees are not enough to cause people to leave those systems yet. BTC is still difficult for anyone not familiar with computers to use, and almost impossible to do so securely and safely like BTC users "should". Well like the Internet was a pretty crazy place in its infancy, but with infrastructure came order, and now the Internet is quite user-friendly, and easier to use safely. Give it some time as hardware wallets become better and the exchange rate stabilizes. Microsoft and others accepting BTC is great because it shows that they consider it a legitimate form of value transfer. Once people begin to realize that these "bitcoins" are essentially just like WoT gold, or Microsoft Points, or any other 'token', except that BTC is as universal and free as ones internet access (another key thing IS free internet access...) they can begin to place serious faith in the value of BTC and will want to hold it.

I think the issue you're referring to here is something even more widespread than Reddit (though there is plenty here). Something to do with society learning to embrace high technology and actually using it efficiently to enrich everyone on a day to day basis. We're still in this weird stage where half of people alive today have easy access to almost all the information known to man while the other half are still in the information dark ages. This is not specific to location necessarily. The type of person of yesterday is not the person of tomorrow and this current difference between the two, coupled with human nature to want to look good, turns many of us (myself included sometimes) into wiki-quoting fanatics who can't stay on a single topic longer than it takes to beat someone into submission concerning that topic... Maybe I'm just crazy though I see plenty of goodness in the world and technology is great but I can't help but notice the ways that it cripples us when we do not pay attention.

I was thinking maybe an online wallet server could have an incorrect blockchain, but after thinking about it, that would be very unlikely without them also having the power to fork the blockchain to their version. 
Well I re-installed and re-indexed QT... guess I get to wait now and see if it does the same thing in ~12 hours. Failing that, I will be reformatting my hard drives.

@_date: 2013-12-07 20:07:29
Depends on how many I had, I suppose.
Benefit to spreading them out: if someone somehow got the key for one of your wallets, the others would not be compromised. 
However if someone got a hold of your key (without you being stupid and entering it somewhere you're not supposed to), they may well have a keylogger/malicious background program running on your computer. In that case, all wallets on that computer are at risk.
Personally I feel the best way to keep assets is spread out. Some in hot wallet, some in cold, some on exchange, some in LTC, some in $$$, EUR, etc... That way you are more resistant not only to The Hacker but also The Market.

If the third party does the job securely and with no or VERY small tax, then I would use them. Some things *need* a third party, yes, but I don't think the only easy and fast way to transfer/buy/sell should include loads of overhead and therefore fees.

Wouldn't any company distributing machines that deal in USD be subject to tax laws and all that? I suppose the ATM could double as a miner/node that passively generates income to support itself, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a transaction fee imposed on them as well.
I sorta see an ATM as a third-party getting in my transaction, but maybe I'm not seeing the right way to implement them.
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:15:46
It's gonna take a few days minimum for them to verify your bank account, and a few other steps that can be done in the meantime. At that point you'll be able to buy BTC but they will also take a few days to be delivered. You get them at the price that was current when you paid for them though.
It took them 2 days to verify my bank account, just a few days ago. I haven't bought yet but everything looks groovy.
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:29:58

as far as I know, LTC transactions take 25% the time as BTC (LTC is running basically the same as BTC except with scrypt and all the numbers are at a factor of 4; 21 million BTC max, 84 million LTC max)
Any cryptocurrency could arbitrarily set these values to what they feel is needed. Even BTC could be changed to accommodate, but it is seen as better overall if it is changed only when necessary to prevent network asplode.

Good post, and I think it's true. I've been probing random people I come in contact with lately and almost all non-internet folk just give me "a whatcoin?"
I think part of the issue is the uncertain amount of total BTC in action. As infrastructure grows, it will become apparent just how many coins are actively circulated. Also, as the rate of mining slows down, the value will stabilize due to difficulty in mining lots and selling.
Hopefully fees can be minimized to the amount of electricity that it takes the network to facilitate transactions... A community-funded solar plant that powers a serverhouse for an exchange might be an interesting idea... I don't know how well it would pan out.

I'm really interested in hardware wallets, unnecessary as they might be. But really, if I had any sizable chunk of cryptos, I'd like to be the sole carrier of the information needed to access them, so they make sense to me. Anything else is just mathematically less safe. My only question is how secure this type of device can be?
I'm not any digital security expert, but I'm guessing some malicious genius could figure out a way to pull info from one of those wallets wirelessly, unless the whole card had a shield of some sort that you remove when ready to use the card. Or  maybe another sort of double/triple authentication could be implemented. (Thumbprint scanner? Voice recognition? sensor that only allows transaction if someone (you) is holding the thing?)
I hope this idea gets somewhere! Are you looking at building a few of these?

If you buy now, don't invest a large portion of available funds. The market may go up even higher, or down quite a bit. Buy in smaller increments over a time/price period you feel safe at. Do lots of research and look for trends that may signal things. Don't treat it purely as a means of profit (although it can be seen as such now). You're holding BTC that can be used for things!

Sounds good! Now that I understand it would only be active when in use, it makes more sense. I would carry one! Maybe I was getting a little future-hopeful with finger/retina/dna scanners n shit haha...
If I may point out one thing, the issue of security is even larger with BTC, since with a credit card there is 'almost' no risk; you can report fraud and magical monies come out of the print machine to cover both your expense and the guy that charged 20 Hulu subs to your card. With BTC, once it's gone, it's gone. I see this as a feature of BTC overall, but it's one more thing to consider carefully.

Hang on to the BTC you still have, save what you can, and buy when the markets are down. Buying in during a rise is risky and dangerous emotionally as you're trying to play 'catch up' to the people who bought earlier than you. Don't let it tempt you! If you let logic make decisions, you could still retire relatively early (I don't know how old you are ofc)
For that matter, if BTC can be an investment for you, so can anything else. If this has peaked your interest in trading/investing, look at other markets as well. Obviously read lots and learn how to avoid making big mistakes before putting your money on the line, and play safe with stops and whatnot. Calculative wealth &gt; Opportunistic greed
EDIT: Though as others said, if you're not ready to fully invest yourself in investing, don't peg dreams to the idea.

This is brill! I also loved the surprise paper wallets and think it's a good way to get people in the know and possibly using BTC!
I'd be super happy if it could automate the wallet creation and BTC splitting process like so:
1) Deposit 100 mBTC to the website
2) Select "1 mBTC per tipslip" (or whatever I feel is a nice tip)
3) When I need, say, 10 tipslips, I ask the website and it generates 10 images in a zipfile that I can download and use to print 10 business/index card sized paper wallets
4) Keep a few at a time in my physical wallet and use them to tip people! Awesome way to present the idea to people!
5) If the tip isn't claimed in 15-30 days, it gets reverted to my wallet
It would also be great to have the option to revert certain tipslips, or all at once if I find that someone has taken my business cards...
I think it would benefit to have a SERIOUSLY SIMPLE start page, because quite a lot of people still are just not computer-savvy and are easily scared by complexity, the thing that BTC is trying to avoid in the first place.
An offline tool would be even cooler! I wouldn't mind paying a small amount for the software even, since it represents your (or someone's) time, and to not be paid for the work you do is just silly. As long as I can pay in BTC! But I don't think that will be a problem ;)
EDIT: I did not realize the security concerns that others have pointed out... Yes this could be a problem but I'm sure there are ways around it. An offline application seems even better in this case!

I really am not a crypto-geek or network programmer so I don't know for sure. From things people have said though, I think a change can be made so long as the whole network agrees to and confirms the changes. 
It would have to be a serious problem with a lot of people affected for it to happen, and I think other solutions would be possible for all but the worst crises.

Can I get a picture of you doing something with a Sharpie to verify? 1 picture is easy to fake.
That aside, the best financial advice/experience I have has come from my depression-era grandfather, so I ain't hating!

Based on my unintelligible mumblings and self-important calculations... less than $100 at the moment, but not much less. I will definitely be investing fairly heavily if it goes below $250 though. Depends on how long it takes to correct compared to how quickly it is adopted mainstream, and other things that are basically impossible to predict.

How does FOREX turn your EUR into USD?

Our money (The USD, I assume you mean) is not backed by gold.
EDIT: Other than that, good! I also am nudging my parents in the direction, hoping that it will help them save for retirement. There are many other reasons why BTC/cryptocurrencies will grow! Research them yourself and decide which are the most relevant to your and his situations.
