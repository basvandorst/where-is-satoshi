No. I'm in it for the satoshis.

Making it worthless as a store of value.

Not when whales are in it for the $$$.

There is still incentive if you can afford to buy the equipment. The cost of a miner is reasonable IMO.

He's a middleman by trade. A banker. But at least he recognizes the big problems.

I admire your dedication to the troll. You can't manipulate exchange rate without consequence.
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:46:27
Also ITT lots of salty Keynesians defending fiat currency which all banks manipulate for their own gains.

Why would I loan money to people I don't want to loan money to?
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:22:24
They also spend it building bombs and vaporizing innocent people. Sound money is a constraint on wasteful spending.
@_date: 2019-08-10 05:40:32
You are arguing in favor of fiat currency. How does that prove your point?
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:42:41
Gold has been money for thousands of years. There is a stable inflation rate and the industrial revolution happened under the gold standard. I am not in favor of keynesian economics.

Have you seen Japan's debt to GDP? First you seem to be in favor of QE, now you aren't?
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:15:48
I understand there is a legal definition. QE is still manipulation however you spin it.

I'll stick to investing in myself and scarce assets but thanks.

Says the socialist. Not surprised to see increased Fed shilling in this sub.

Good article. [
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:04:02
Feel free to explain. Keynesian economics is a tragedy.
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:06:48
Butt of course. What is your business with the butts, if I may ass?
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:03:20
Currency manipulation is a vague term. All central banks do it.

Yuan dropped about 2% after Trump tariffs.

Never heard of the depression of 1920-21?

What's a God tier meme by your standards? UBI? Free healthcare for all?
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:09:09
Has there ever been a decentralized currency with 0 inflation? I understand your point, but money and currency is an ongoing experiment.
Fees will be enough incentive for miners as they will increase with the price and additional demand for blockspace. Everyday transactions will be made on a separate layer like lightning.
Edit: Also the halvening means it will never truly reach 21 million hard cap.

Either option has roughly equal consequences. I disagree that it is "very" different. Centralized fiat either way you look at it.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:37:51
False. Increasing the supply of anything will lower the price.
@_date: 2019-08-07 06:51:09
You understand that printing internally devalues the currency internationally, no?
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:47:54
It seems like the usual disagreement between keynesians and austrians. 1000 hours, yeah that's nothing.
@_date: 2019-08-08 06:44:36
It's almost like currencies dont exist in a vacuum or something.
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:08:58
We all know Bitcoin will be manipulated. Gold has been manipulated as well. It's better than manipulating a centralized currency with unlimited supply.
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:52:03
Wow, you really don't understand economics do you? More dollars in circulation lowers their purchasing power (price).
@_date: 2019-08-08 04:09:07
Troll harder. You can't increase/decrease the supply of anything without affecting the price.

From the man himself. "There's no danger of a serious rise in the cost of living."
@_date: 2019-08-09 19:52:29
You are absolutely right, so bring on the downvotes. You can't credit a debt based economy for improving the quality of life. That's like saying  your friend who owns a million dollar house with zero equity is wealthy.
@_date: 2019-08-09 19:39:14
Ok, sure buddy. War bonds used to be sold to finance war. Now they just loan the money into existence to fund it.

Many people can expect around ~$1M earnings in their lifetime. You are there already.

They can't devalue your holdings by inflation. Anything they do comes with a cost.
