You're not very bright are you... I site  as the list of Bitcoin Core contributors... I then list the contributors (and if they work for Blockstream, I put it in parentheses). I never claimed the other individuals worked for Blockstream, you just have poor reading comprehension. 5 out of the 14 Bitcoin Core Contributors listed here  work for Blockstream: 
Blockstream is funded by big banks, for example, AXA.

At current prices, 240GB costs $8.4. It's becoming more and more common for laptops to have 1 - 2 TB hard drives, and the price of storage is only going to continue to go down... Upgrading to 4MB blocks is certainly safe.

Did you intentionally leave out the rest of the quote?


Here's the list:
Dr. Pieter Wuille (Blockstream), Gregory Maxwell (Blockstream), Luke-Jr (Blockstream), Jorge Timón (Blockstream), Patrick Strateman (Blockstream), Peter Todd (maybe contractor for Blockstream?), Cory Fields (possibly connected to Blockstream? Lobbied for SegWit), Eric Lombrozo, Nicolas Dorier, Dr. Johnson Lau, Suhas Daftuar, ฿tcDrak, Michael Ford, paveljanik

Ask any of us at rbtc and we will tell you that sending mass PM spam is unacceptable. is the guy who first accused Roger Ver of "astroturfing". He immediately [apologized profusely]( because it was a blatant lie. You decided to run with it though, and made a [post]( about it. [asked you to remove]( the post, but you [refused]( even though you knew there was no evidence for your attack. But go ahead, and keep pushing your narrative. I'm sure many will believe you.

What a totally unintelligent comment. How do you think it's okay to be so disrespectful towards a bunch of developers who have never harmed anyone in their lives? Developers giving away their time for free, to try and help Bitcoin, and solve the scaling debate. Do you think BU is an attempt to trick the masses? A Trojan horse to destroy Bitcoin? Core is the one whose team is primarily made up of Blockstream employees (you know, the company who received millions in funding from big banks). But I'm sure you're on to something. BU is just a social engineering project.
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:03:19
Maybe you are unaware of what ad hominem is? I called his comment unintelligent, which is not an insult but a factual remark.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:53:32
You do realize that either side can say this about the other? Roger Ver has millions of dollars, and Jihan Wu is a co-founder of Bitmain, the largest manufacturer of ASIC's... But Blockstream received $76 million in investments from big banks, and also employs half of the Bitcoin Core contributors listed on 
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:30:17
I think you are confusing Gavin with Adam Back. He is the creator of Bitcoin (minus inflation control).
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:12:28
The overwhelming amount of upvotes on this post is testament to the fact that the majority of Bitcoiners agree that Roger Ver is a villain, trying to destroy Bitcoin as usual. /s
Oh wait, it's just the paid Roger Ver shills downvoting this post. /s

Are you aware that on average has less than 1,000 users online? Are you aware that the only reason has this many users online is due to [this]( post that hit Are you aware that on average has a lower subscriber-online user ratio than rbtc? Great argument though.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:53:41
Someone's downvoting this thread? Yes, it's me and many others who don't appreciate the tone of your post calling BU a shitcoin version of Bitcoin. Stop trying to scare people into thinking this is some sort of terrifying hostile takeover. BU is a different solution to the scaling debate, and it's perfectly safe despite the FUD people like you spread.
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:35:13
Miners DO control Bitcoin because mining requires vast resources and is impossible to "fake" without spending vast amounts of money. Every POW cryptocurrency can be destroyed by a 51% attack. Every POW cryptocurrency is controlled by mining. The miners have more stake in the game than anyone else,THAT'S why they control Bitcoin. Your comment is nonsensical. How would Bitcoin even work if individual users could change it?
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:26:58
Scam? Are you serious? 99% of the code in BU is from the almighty Bitcoin Core. How stupid do you have to be to think that BU was maliciously designed to be some sort of Trojan horse? Go learn about the Bitcoin protocol, learn how to code, and come back and tell me what's wrong with it? It's open source you know!
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:44:48
How fucking stupid do you have to be to believe that Bitmain (the largest ASIC supplier in the world) is trying to make some side money by destroying Bitcoin and diversifying in Ethereum? If Bitcoin suffers, no one will want to buy ASIC's, but sure, I believe that there is a grand conspiracy here.
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:40:47
Raising the block size allows more people to use Bitcoin, and miners would be incentivized to do so because it will appreciate their investment. Miners are incentivized not to raise the block reward because that would cause inflation and make their investment worth less. Miners are not stupid or malicious, and would never raise the block reward. Miners will do what's best for Bitcoin because they want their investment to go up in value. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:13:09
Really? The Bitcoin Unlimited Developers are paid by Roger Ver? I would love if you could link me to the evidence that shows that! :)
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:40:35
Maybe you're having a hard time understanding this. If the blocksize is not raised, it's impossible for more users to use Bitcoin. Period. Are you aware that home internet connections are getting faster and faster, and hard drive storage is extremely cheap? If the blocksize is raised to 4MB, research has shown that 90% of existing nodes will be able to continue working. So you may not be able to run a full node on your toaster anymore, but at least more users can use Bitcoin.

Your rebuttals are so weak. Please read my comment again, I did not attack the Core developers. called BU a "social engineering project", as if it is an attempt to trick people. I'm drawing attention to the fact that a large percentage of the Core team are employees of Blockstream (a company whose business model depends on SegWit being implemented). Do you not see a conflict of interest?
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:17:34
The more you try to use this stupid tactic to try and convince people that BU is some evil Trojan Horse trying to destroy Bitcoin, the more people will go to the alternate Bitcoin subreddit. People are getting sick and tired of these shit slinging posts.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:56:47
I give myself away? LOL, give myself away as what? I'm not a shill you fool, I didn't write out the link because I didn't want my post to be censored. Certain keywords will trigger that. Also stop randomly mentioning Roger Ver, he has nothing to do with this, and it makes you look like an idiot. Also, until today there has never been over 3K users in this subreddit. Do you even realize the only reason this subreddit is getting attention is because it has a post that reached the front of ALSO, the rbitcoin subreddit almost ALWAYS has a lower subscriber-online user ratio than rbtc. rBitcoin has also been around far longer, and obviously has a better name, so it of course has more users. None of your arguments are valid or prove anything.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:35:41
The fact that you even wrote this post tells me that you don't understand the scaling debate, or Bitcoin Unlimited whatsoever. No one is taking over Bitcoin. If Bitcoin Unlimited is chosen, all that means is that the miners who have mined Bitcoin Core for all those years decided they wanted Bitcoin Unlimited instead. What the fuck do you think is going on? Do you think someone is trying to destroy/take over Bitcoin? The current miners who have supported core for years are choosing BU instead! That's it!
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:56:16
You clearly have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You're just trusting that a poster is telling the truth without even reading evidence for yourself. Gavin Andresen has discussed these points already, and if you're actually curious to learn more, you should go read it. Stop spouting nonsense when you aren't educated in the matter, you make yourself look stupid.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:30:28
Hey, newsflash! Miners will ALWAYS decide what Bitcoin is, and what rules will be in place. If the miners chose BU, then that's that. Miners work for you? What the fuck is wrong with you. Miners hold the ability to vote on what hardfork they want, because they are the ones who have the MOST stake in Bitcoin. They pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in electricity costs, people who run full nodes DON'T. Miners are the center of Bitcoin, and it's solely up to them to choose what hardfork they want. That's how Bitcoin is DESIGNED.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:58:13
THANK YOU! Keep fighting the good fight. I also downvoted the original post due to the presentation, calling BU a shitcoin... Slowly but surely, maybe both sides can stop vilifying each other.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:24:25
Don't try to blame an entire subreddit for a single user's mistake.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:52:11
Well yes  lists 5 of the Bitcoin Core contributors, so that's 5 out of 14, not quite half... The point is that by being both a Core contributor AND a Blockstream employee, there's a conflict of interest. They are paid to do what's best for Blockstream, so they will push Bitcoin towards the direction of what's best for Blockstream, rather than what the community as a whole want.
But you are in the top 1% of the most reasonable people in this subreddit. Most people will just scream at you and yell hostile takeover if you mention BU. This stupid debate has been turned into a political war when it doesn't have to be.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:26:46
I can't believe someone actually took the time to draw this comic in an attempt to bash BU.
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:45:48
How many people here actually believe this bullshit propaganda that gets floated around that Roger Ver is some evil character constantly trying to fuck shit up? Nothing he's doing here is illegal/immoral/or wrong. Stop trying to blame Roger Ver for all of your problems.
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:50:02
Oh yes I'm sure Jihan is SO scared. How about you stop trying to push your bullshit narrative that Jihan is some evil player trying to destroy Bitcoin. Bitcoin Unlimited is simply a different solution to the scaling debate, stop trying to make it political!

"cryptographer, privacy enhancing tech, ecash, inventor of hashcash (bitcoin is hashcash extended with inflation control)"
If anyone is not-so-clever, I would say it's Adam Back. Why should the CEO of Blockstream be trying to confuse people into thinking he's Bitcoin's creator?
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:20:13
Be careful, this entire argument is totally political. Supporters of BU will be called shills and FUDsters. In reality, BU is just another option to the scaling debate. Learn more at the btc subreddit.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:25:46
This is a bad post, and you should feel bad. People are getting tired of these unintelligent shit posts vilifying people. Roger Ver is not the fucking president of BU, no one is. It is each miner's choice whether or not they will point their miners towards a BU pool. Blame the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:13:57
If you want low on chain transaction fees, you will need bigger blocks. Period. BU is the best solution at this point.

This has nothing to do with the China news... This has EVERYTHING to do with the fact that Bitcoin was way overvalued at $1100 (and rose to that price WAY too quickly) and we corrected downward because of that.
