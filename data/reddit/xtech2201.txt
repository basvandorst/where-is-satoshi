i still use coinbase. i like to think im not a noob anymore. are there any exchanges that allow you to sell btc and deposit funds to a bank account (us person here) that are cheaper? i can learn any website, just need pointers on which ones are legit.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:19:34
LOL no
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:09:22
the wallet i have at coinbase is for selling off the coins i make from mining. when segwit wallet support is added to the core GUI client, i can use the address in the receive field as a payout address for the pools i use, correct?
til then i dont have an issue using coinbase since i sell off what i get on that wallet immediately or shortly thereafter. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:00:11


can i use this for the mining pools i use? i only do big transactions to keep fees to a minimum, usually once a month or so. id rather store them on my server at home and xfer them to coinbase as needed for sells.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:26:18
as opposed to faux.news?
rofl you stupid pede.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:42:05
a little. it runs a small variety of programs that make me money each month (gomez peer, koinme, swagbucks). for the most part though, its just a file server and now a bitcoin node.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:17:39
its a thinkserver that ive  locked down pretty tight. my network is behind an edgerouter and behind that is a software firewall.
i actually do IT security for a living so it's right up my alley.  im looking at a trezor... however id like to get one off amazon and my biggest concern is getting one from a 3rd party seller that's done something malicious to it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:39:52
im in the process of switching to the software wallet provided by the Bitcoin core software im using. i currently use the wallet provided by coinbase but after this week im likely going to switch so i can store them on my pc.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:05:55
yep. checked and my node is live :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:40:44
honestly a good part of a week. when i first installed the software, it gave me an estimate of 6-8 hours. this jumped up to a month, then slowly whittled down to a week.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:16:32
yeah probably. however i acquired the server im using for less than 10 bucks :D
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:25:47
no comrade, this isnt faux.news.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:42:31
a node verifies transactions. without them being verified youd never get your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:41:13
upnp but i made sure the port was open on my edgerouter

cisco admin who is now running 2 mines (with a 3rd in production). considering quitting my day job honestly (the pay is pretty damn good)
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:43:12
yeah, no. you cant cpu/gpu mine bitcoin since like forever ago.
ASIC or bust. something like an avalon, dragonmint (if they follow through), antminer s7/9, dash miners if you get em cheap.
electricity i s also a factor. so is 220v. to make it profitable you must have all of those plus cheap power and good cooling.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:27:21
its 100% fake.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:44:59
so, i could set a super low fee for transactions on my end and have my own node verify it somehow? 
go on if yes...
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:01:34
you could pay your taxes like a good citizen and stop trying to pay the least possible. its crap like that that's messing with our economy.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:27:42
its fake.

7963.20 as i type this.
8k shall happen tonight!
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:16:24
so i have an IBM thinkserver sitting around doing nothing. also have a gigabit line but only 50 on the upstream. what benefit(s) are there to running a node besides helping the community?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:24:53


actually none of 45s policies are responsible for the economic rebound. why? BECAUSE NONE OF HIS POLICIES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS HAVE TAKEN EFFECT.
all you are seeing are OBAMA-era policies in action. nothing you are seeing right now is the result of 45s policies.. because none have taken effect!
stop drinking the koolaid!

idk about fake begging, but the entire post reeks of attention whoring / look at me i want to be the center of attention.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:29:08
thats a daily limit for me. my weekly is  105k
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:28:33
furnishing the house for one is going to cost a pretty penny. im looking at a house around 250-300k and the rest (100k or so) in decorating, reshaping, furnishing,  changing, etc. 
also, i mine. i have a good chunk of s7/9s and some avalons coming in.
plus i run a mine  that's expanding tomorrow, were getting in 30 or so units.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:01:02
well. my personal sell threshold will be met when it hits 10k. looks like im getting a house next year like i was planning on.. but without the mortgage. i WAS going to sell at 9500... but decide to HODL a hair longer.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:39:46
i get where you're coming from. i mine also though... so its not like ill never have bitcoin again. i have a constant source coming in from our mining operations.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:14:00
before/after pix pls!
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:32:17
ehh, why are they blocking? my account is verified and ive never had issues with them.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:57:52
just update the firmware as soon as you get it and stay the fuck away from antpoo.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:26:42
LOL fake
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:23:48
ive been looking for a coinbase alternative. thanks
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:18:10
i bought 100 when it was around 5 bucks a pop. 49.something left. held onto em for years because i thought btc would bust eventually.
probably going to cash them in once it hits 8k and buy a house
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:31:58
how the frickin hell is the price STILL climbing?? this is amazing!
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:29:02
what dip? stfu
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:23:59
so if i set it up and let the code block bad actors, id be doing the community a service, eh?
im thinking about setting up a node at one of our mines also.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:21:39
this would be great, mainly because a lot of these 'bitcoin to buy bla bla bla' have popped up since a few people mentioned buying a house with bitcoin in other, non-related threads.
since then there has been a rash of 'bitcoin did this and that, i was lucky enough to buy in the beginning'
i mean it really reeks of attention seeking behaviors and outright jealousy.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:25:10
GTFO you maga shitstain, we dont want you or your racist kind here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:21:07
just saw almost 1k value disappear in seconds on cryptocompare.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:46:43
*hugs* good bot
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:57:12
avalons and possibly draonminers are a far better deal. invest in heat shrouds, you will need them eventually.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:13:39
im thinking about liquidating 80% of what i have, HODL the rest. would give me a really, really small mortgage payment each month and i dont sell all my btc

poor snowflake needs his safe space
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:07:47
i convinced my boss to order 5. we went in halves on em. hoping it pans out.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:07:35
the guys i work for, one is a currency trader and the other owns the buildings we are building mines in. the building owner has thrown about 10k into this and has let us move to whatever space we want. he even pays for the electricity to be upgraded (were dropping in a 400a panel today).
we pay commercial rates: around .04 per kWh. our s7 miners use around 1500 watts @ 7 amps and run about 30 bucks a month. the s9 and d3 miners run a little more. the d3 miners are meh and we arent buying anymore of those. the s9 and avalon miners produce around 10-20 a day per miner and cost about 50-ish a month to run off 220v power.
220v is the key for us that cuts our costs way down. when we were running some off 110, power costs were a little more but still profitable.
also, i overclock the shit out of our hardware. our s7s have been running stable at 5th/s for 6+ months. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:06:25
looking at his picture, he paid VIA bitpay, so hes likely screwed.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:06:27
Thanks. Been into this since almost the beginning, though not nearly as active as i am now(i do actual mining along with HODL'ing and have a full node running off my gigabit line).
10k / 1 btc was my goal. while i wouldnt mind waiting, i want to lock in the price at slightly above 10k.. because as you said, anything can happen.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:44:17
ugh i fucking hope nicehash starts at midnight CST like they did last time. long as the transaction goes in before the shut down im good.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:34:23
pension and 427k
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:38:27
all of our hardware is colocated. we pay around 1200 a month for it but take in way, way more than that.
i have a single 220 connection at my apt for testing miners that are problematic or purchased second hand.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:41:24
a long password with special characters really doesnt help much.
use a sentence. easy to remember vs some random string of characters.

yeah, wife and i  both have gov't jobs. i just run a bitcoin mine on the side that seems to be turning into a full time gig.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:40:57
not sure if this is a high fee or not, but i was charged around 5 bucks USD to transfer $540 through coinbase. can i eliminate or severely reduce that fee with gdax instead? i only do large xfers on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:59:26
man i really think we will vegeta tonight
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:18:49
im planning on holding til next year unless btc happens to spike above 10k. might sell then and get the ball rolling, idk.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:54:20
in the process of setting up a full node (6 hours remaining on sync time) and starting to look into other aspects of bitcoin. the fees and what wallet/exchange to use has always confused me.
currently use coinbase (i usually do one large transaction a month, if that, to minimize fees) but have not a clue on how to set my own fees or if they even support it.
what would be the recommendation for a wallet / exchange to use that allows me to set fees and where can i research on how much of a fee i should set depending on transaction size?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:32:21
dragonmint, not miner, my bad. IF it pans out also...
