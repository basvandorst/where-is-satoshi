True. In fact, only the miner who luckily get the solution  can decide how much transactions to include in the block.

I'd put difficulty as a proportional factor. The higher the difficulty the larger amount should be allowed.

The success rate of spamming is inversely proportional to the hash rate.

The counterparty risk is inadequacy of held bitcoin when user decides to move the coins to their own wallet.  Also to meet the demand, exchanges must have pre-allocated reserve which would require settlement in the blockchain.

The limit is just artificial while mining difficulty  and network bandwidth are low. 
During low mining difficulty, there is a high frequency for spam. Low network bandwidth will also result to higher orphan rate.
Overtime, when difficulty and bandwidth grow, the size limit should go away and fee market will replace it.

In addition, it will be feasible for device manufacturers to subsidize upfront cost(cheaper to buy like smartphones in contract with telcos) for consumers.

Bitsim. 
The idea is that a sender will have to ask first the receiver via bitsim text command his public address. Bitsim then will have a command to transmit a signed transaction to a local relay service. Maybe add a confirmation message too for both parties.

The good thing about a truly fixed supply currency such as bitcoin is that unlike fiat, when the holder dies, everyone gets a slight bump in value.

Probably depends on thermal envelope of a device. If its a heater, all of its power will be used for mining. Sub milliwatts for battery powered devices.

In the philippines, we have  local btc(rebit.com, coins.ph) companies that can pay most utilities/insurance/bills. A bit pricey though, they charge a flat rate equivalent to 0.675 dollars per transaction. If your bill is less than 67.5 usd, you'll be paying more than 1%.

Website. Just type it in your browser address bar. Shlould appear as top result in what ever search engine your browser uses.
It's basically a classified ad for bitcoin. Sellers can post how much they can sell at a defined exchange rate plus premium. Trade can be cash, bank transfer or paypal transfer depending on the seller.

I buy bitcoin monthly to pay for utilities. I normally add a little bit for hoarding. I spend only when the price is equal or higher compared to when I bought it. I end up paying less for my bills and the change adds up to my hodl.

Verified transaction requires at least 1 block confirmation. This is sufficient for most transaction. Transactions are bundled in a block by miners and prioritized based on miner fee, data size and age of UTXO(the coins being spent). This usually takes 10 mins. 
There is also a block size limit. If the transaction happens to arrive when that limit is reached, it will be included in the next block(another 10 min wait). 
@_date: 2015-04-09 01:40:09
Most of the risks are associated with conversion. If the price goes up, debtor will have more difficulty acquiring bitcoin for amortization which results in late payment or worse default.

Bip38. Make backup in all cloud storage you have and print some. This is the most redundunt solution that can mitigate key loss. You don't have to worry about theft since it is encrypted with a passphrase/password. 
Hardware wallet is still vulnerable to loss of device and even its backup. You also have to worry about the resiliency and security of the backup.

pos should be able to generate a qr scannable offline transaction. The customers wallet app can then sign and broadcast. This way, user don't have to put the amount. The pos can even create a tx with multiple outputs for every items, vat, fee etc.

I hope a wallet implement a bip38 hd address. To spend, one needs to type the passphrase. Mycellium has a pin feature but it's not bip38.
@_date: 2015-03-13 00:41:58
With less nodes and potentially a different block packaging mechanism, implementation will need far more hardened endpoints and transport layer. Still decentralized, but way too few participants that it will be a magnitude inefficient compared to even some of the altcoins. The bank will still be vulnerable to existing centralized risks(losing keys) which has nothing to do with the blockchain.

@_date: 2015-03-01 07:33:40
First, generate your keys. I suggest using bitaddress.org and create a single batch (single passphrase) of BIP38 keys. Store the pdf on several locations, cloud, your pc and printed copy.
Scan the first one with any wallet that supports bip38 to test that your passpharse is working. Then discard it. Scan the rest of public keys so you can easily transfer coins to them. Say 1 btc per address.
Just use the default hd address of your preferred app for hot wallet.

Bitcoinaddress.org . if you're paranoid, you can download the source from github and run the html locally. I suggest batch produce keys using same passphrase. Test and discard the first. Use the rest of the batch.

There is no mycelium cloud that stores your btc nor your key. The 12 word seed is just a representation of your private key so you can easily store them somewhere, say a paper. The transactions and balances you can see in the app is derived from blockchain using the public key of your private key.

See bip39. Basically, the private key can be derived from just a couple of words. Keep the words safe and you're good to go.
