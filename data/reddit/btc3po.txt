I believe the anchor is that the subheader hashes are only valid insofar as they have been derived from valid bitcoin blocks, and the resulting sideblocks were added within the intervals between the generation of those bitcoin headers.


Perhaps you are right. There would need be a way to determine if a sideblock was added after the creation of a new bitcoin header. I suppose the timestamp would suffice?

Sorry. It's not quite merged mining as far as I understand. As this sidechain does not interact with bitcoin in anyway; nothing needs to be inserted in the bitcoin blockchain.
Perhaps more simply, each bitcoin block creates the opportunity to add new precedent blocks to the sidechain, with the starting point being the longest sidechain (built from the longest subchains derived within the intervals of each previous bitcoin block).
Each new bitcoin block results in the terminus of a subchain, and a starting point for a new subchain. These subchains build the complete sidechain.

No. :) Just ruminating on a higher tx volume network that leverages the bitcoin PoW.
EDIT: Actually, maybe I am. :P
I believe you could prevent the addition of sideblocks after the advent of the the new bitcoin header by simply relying on the bitcoin consensus; also perhaps making sideblock interval rewards diminish with each block in the interval would provide incentive to move on.

Whomever has extended the sidechain with the hash derived from the bitcoin header of the longest bitcoin blockchain (most recent). Of course, each new bitcoin header might result in rendering invalid the most recent sideblock.
