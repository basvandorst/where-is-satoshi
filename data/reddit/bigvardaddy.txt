What credibility does Bitcoin have that other cryptocurrencies do not?
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:45:55
Monero is more distributed, more decentralized, private blockchain, been around since at least 2014.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:24:56
How do you know he's not around? Are you 100% certain the NSA doesn't have millions of the first mined Bitcoins. To me it is likely the NSA would create the tech to control is before they no longer have a chance, but maybe your just way smarter than I am.

Centralization is good! The new Bitcoin sub lol
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:15:50
Hey I got a grant that covered all of my college here in Canada and I'm getting a decent tax return from my last job. No complaints from me lol
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:03:15
What do you think besides hype supports the price rises? lol
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:21:43
Sure as long as you don't mind it being completely centralized.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:01:28
Sure but why does a cryptocurrency need to be backed by another cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:19:53
I don't think kfc wait times went up thousands of percents
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:47:21
Why is it you guys can only use anecdotes to talk shit about BCash guys while BCash guys talk shit directly
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:29:06
That doesn't mean its backed by bitcoin. If shitcoin xyz goes x100 its not backed by 100 more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:35:29
Harper would be ashamed of you shilling such a shitcoin. He'd be buying Monero
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:59:00
Its an Ethereum killer though. Bitcoin to 25k!
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:57:39
Im so confused lol
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:49:56
Eth isn't supposed to be money and neither is Bitcoin. Rootstock is running on server nodes, might as well use mySQL lol
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:23:14
I'll check Webster dictionary lmao 
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:30:48
Why wouldn't an asset with many features and POS rewards be a better store of value?
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:48:01
Most autistic comment I've ever read bud
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:21:05
Why would crypto have a gold standard lmao
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:14:29
Satoshi has billions of dollars more stake in Bitcoin than Vitalik has in Ether.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:53:42
That's retarded didn't one your buddies just say that the chain with the most consensus is bitcoin and the rest are altcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:32:37
What does Bitcoin have that other coins don't? Smart contracts? Private ledgers? Decentralized exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:08:09
Show us what you contributed to crypto if you aren't just trying to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:25:35
There's no point there. What gives Bitcoin virtue?
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:46:17
Bitcoin shouldn't be for transactions. Just hodl and become a multi-billionaire can't wait for the exciting price celebrations coming to r/bitcoin in the future
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:19:04
What's a shitcoin a cryptocurrency that doesn't work efficiently? I didn't rag on someone for buying a "centralized shitcoin" just because it isn't the holy Bitcoin so I won't answer that question. You're intention in your comment is clear, you think people should only buy Bitcoin because it benefits you when you in turn plan to sell it to someone else. There's nothing wrong with you speculating on Bitcoin and him speculating on Ripple.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:39:41
I own Bitcoin so let's hope illogical reasons keep it the front runner.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:02:33
Why are you guys obsessed with this man?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:55:20
I think western union is beating you guys on txfees lol are you ok with second place? I don't have a side, I think both coins suck, but have you ever thought about what a regular non-autistic user would think reading your post?
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:32:58
I honestly want less people using bitcoin even if it means a lower price. I'm trying to take out half of the 600 I put in to secure profit and fees are not just killing me, I don't meet minimum withdrawal at bitfinex because bitcoin is so slow. Seriously compared to anything in the top 10 cryptos besides Ripple, this coin is worse than useless.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:00:22
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:22:59
do you have small hands like Trump?
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:42:12
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:36:55
Are you poor shaming me bud?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:13:08
I didn't ask you a question lol
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:20:45
Why are you comparing Bitcoin to a centralized company?
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:01:34
Ethereum is up 5% to BTC when is it going to equal $0? I want to buy some
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:05:08
Are you sure you aren't risking being homeless on your Bitcoin holdings? Why would you even need to bring up homelessness and altcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:09:24
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:14:09
I think Bitcoin will slip to  in a couple years without the market dying
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:54:38
They are kicking the can down the road though. Lightning txns are centralized and require an on chain transaction. The devs said they couldn't wait until that fee is over 1000
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:11:50
Features in a protocol are a novelty? Lmao it's like Bitcoin would be better without  Segwit, Lightening and Multi-sig. Damn features.
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:02:02
Bro just because you're an idiot doesn't mean everyone else is. Why the fuck would you put 10k into Tron even if you had that in cash lmao
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:49:06
IT'S NOT HIS MONEY. he's paying interest on 12k and has nothing left, why would you ever use borrowed money unless there are at least historical returns to look at.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:34:54
You're deluded bud lol Bitcoin is still far from a sure thing, do you really feel bad for people who aren't into speculative assets?
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:52:22
YouTube would work without video compression.
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:14:26
Why does Bitcoin need to hit 1M and buy you a lamb to be used as an alternative currency?
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:12:17
Except it hit the peak of its mainstream adoption...
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:54:29
sure but where is Bitcoins EEA? Why are no companies looking at bitcoin to develop things?
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:17:02
Where was this post when I was selling in Dec? "buy now to lock in your gains".
Oh right BTC didn't work but everyone was yelling "HODL" "You would be stupid to sell we're going to 1 million per bitcoin"
