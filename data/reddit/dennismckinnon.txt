There is one guy who is trying to get nominated for an industry seat that I know very well. He runs a company solely dedicated to helping other companies get into bitcoin and has extremely good values when it comes to returning the foundation to a representation of the community rather then a spokesperson for the companies. His name is David Allen and if he gets in I really think he will be a big boon for the foundation.
Aside from him I agree andreas and two bit idiot are good choices.
People are not a fan of 2 bit (ryan) right now. but You have to give him credit. He put himself out on a limb standing up for what he believes is right and he is extremely passionate about it. The foundation can be so much more then it is. Yes he is hot tempered (if you haven't noticed andreas can get hot tempered too at times but for good reason. There are things in this world that deserve getting angry about.)
We need to infuse the foundation with both passion and a mindfulness to the community.

I agree with you. Unregulated means that we as the customers must take an active role in prevention of theft fraud and breach of contract. We have to make it unfavorable for people intent on such actions to carry it out.
Most of this falls under the same laws that we already have. But the execution of it falls to the people since get can't say this particular government is responsible for enforcing the law if my bitcoins while i'm in canada are stolen by a hacker in Belize.
A decentralized government of the internet realm would be beneficial in this execution and I have long thought it would be a very interesting experiment. but that is a tangent.

you were right it was my mistake. I was rushed and read through too quickly. I lumped the hashing of the public key into the "bells and whistles" and didn't stop to realize that some of it was actually important. Sorry. My bad.
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:29:23
not saying that isn't the case. I just don't think its the case in this instance. 
What reason would someone have to use an exchange right now. Its completely quiet. So you aren't going to make any money there. That removes all of the day traders. The fact that there is still activity is probably left to people trying to squeeze a little out of day to day movements. And people either buying in or selling out. Since the price is constant this seems to be equal. so really it tells us nothing.
That said. Would it be an even better sign if there was high activity during the stability? Yes. Critics of bitcoin are always going on about how its instability is why it will never be a currency. But now we are in a period of stability (still less stable than other currencies granted) so why aren't those critics buying in?

I think what Shrem did was good. But was it necessary? I guess since the BF is trying to be a legitimate face for the governments to talk to it was. But still in the case of Shrem its even more noticeable. Gox deserved it. Shrem didn't. Should we have stood behind him and said "We don't care what the government thinks about this guy. We know him to be a stand up individual" 
A similar situation was lets say Andreas was charged with something that seemed like government overreach would we want him to step down?
I haven't trusted Gox for a long time and actively told new people to Bitcoin to avoid it. And in the case of Gox I am fully against them. Its clearly their fault and when they got in trouble they tried to deflect the tarnish to everything else.
I guess the question that it really boils down is... MtGox managed to survive so long BECAUSE we gave it the benefit of the doubt when things started to go bad because of their past contribution to the community. Were we wrong to do so? 
I'm guessing the answer is that its not Black and White (as usual) sometimes it warrants ostracization sometimes it means we need to support them even more. My fear is that getting burned by Gox will make us too quick to judge or too polarized.
This is by no means a bitcoin only problem. It appears in any actually interesting villain movie. 
I'm not concerned about us "old hands" we know what Bitcoin is about we know that if you trust someone it means you can be burned by them. But we do have to worry about the youngins getting all riled up into angry internet mob.

That is sadly incorrect. The Elliptic curve algorithm which is how public addresses are constructed from private keys (with a few bells and whistles) would be venerable. In essence. Given a bitcoin address, they could find your private key and steal your money (which would now be worthless because nobody is going to store their money in it.)

MtGox was using the transaction id which isn't a fixed part of a transaction its basically just a name given to the transaction. Since its possible to change this without the sender's consent what you do it this.
1) withdraw BTC from mtGox
2) find the transaction they have sent into the network. Change the transaction ID so whatever you like and rebroadcast it to the network.
ONLY ONE OF THESE TWO TRANSACTIONS WILL BE INCLUDED IN A BLOCK
3) If the modified transaction gets into the block when mtgox looks for the confirmed withdrawal in the block chain they won't find it (and think that it didn't get processed).
before this we assumed that you had to call customer service and get them to resend the transaction after verifying by hand that the transaction ID was not in the block chain. This says that it was completely automatic. Yes you would have to be a mtgox customer but you wouldn't need very much deposited in order to make a killing on this since you can in theory double you money each time.
Why didn't they do it by hand? I have no fricken clue. How often have you had a transaction mysteriously get lost for all eternity. It might take a long time but I've never had one that got lost forever even without fees...
Hope thats a clear answer

Very interesting. Though I think we have seen enough sci-fis to know that having a robot-police state is a bad idea :P Normally because humans make programming errors and it all goes bad. A decentralized organization is easiest to implement in the internet. A "government" of the internet does not need to deal with physical resources which often lend themselves to centralization (think waste management... It would be hard to do that in a truely decentralized manner). Not saying such a government in the real world is not possible. Just like all things some jobs can't be split. In a world of information those things are far less in number. 
You also have to consider that as far as efficiency goes some things are more efficient being centralized. Power generation for one (until solar panels become cheap and efficient). Health care is another thing. Even though some parts of it are in efficient due to bureaucracy, universal health care costs less over all then the alternative.
one interesting thing about an internet government using this protocol is that since it is totally programmable and your "identity" is tied to a public key. Punishment can be taken out against you in a decentralized manner. You could even program in a method by which you could be judged but some of your peers (internet jury duty) I haven't solved that part yet. But I have figured out voting so it wouldn't be too hard i don't think. Most of its capability is not in the protocol itself. DFC just allows consensus on a collection of files. But some of those files allow rules to be programmed in a semi-script type language. Its those capabilities that really make it powerful.

The most secure way to transfer bitcoins is by using the bitcoin protocol. Since the bitcoins themselves don't exist you can't store the bitcoins on a usb stick. What you store is cyrptographic proof that you own those bitcoins. But the Bitcoin protocol serves this purpose. 
If you know beforehand how much you want to transfer. you could write a transaction and give it to them signed which they can then release and get the bitcoins. 
I'm not sure if this is possible with the whole "Is Standard" thing but you might even be able to make it a universally redeemable transaction. But now you are getting into designing your own transaction by hand (or with a program) and then having to figure out how to redeem them. Its just a mess.

Credit cards incur their expense to merchants because of the risk of chargebacks. Allowing reverisble transactions Is completely unacceptable. However if you have been around for 6 months or so you MUST have heard about multisig transactions. An escrow service which is impossible for the mediator to steal the money is very simple with 2 of 3 signatures. This is the change of mindset that we need to have. Its not important that we can reverse a transaction. Its important that we can not send it in the first place with a mediator able to decide who gets the money.
Pursonally I don't care what we call Bitcoin. Currency , store of value. Who cares? Bitcoin is Bitcoin. It has these features and instead of trying to make it fit into our old models we need to break the models and be creative with what we can do with it. I sometimes think of it as making it practical to store your cash under your mattress and still use it. 
One final point. Bitcoin must establish its value as itself. A large portion of its value is that it makes transacting with anyone anywhere in the world with access to the internet simple. If you do a job for someone (you don't need to know anything about where they live or who they are) and you get paid in bitcoin. you will instantly get how amazing it is. (This was the experience that really astonished me I wrote some code for a guy on reddit and for all I know he could be in china but I got paid (it was a small job only 200 mBTC) instantly. If i was worried about getting short changed. I could have asked for a bitcoin escrow service. But I trusted this complete stranger so I didn't ask for that.
One final point. You mention how use we have become to being safe when it come to money. And this is very true. But who in the end pays for the risk of fraud with credit cards and other things? Visa? The Government? and who do they get their money from? Visa is a company and makes massive profits. You can bet that they are charging every customer in order to pay for the fraud. As for governments. Their only resource is People. The suck you dry in order to pay corporations and banks. The cost always comes back to us. Bitcoin allows us to get rid of some of these giant leeches in our system.

@_date: 2014-03-29 21:22:54
sort of. it works out to about every two weeks but its actually based on the number of blocks. so the network recalibrates where 2016 blocks which is two weeks if the blocks are being found once every 10 minutes but since it doesn't over compensate for speed. If you find those 2016 blocks in 11 days it recalibrates as if the network speed is exactly 20% higher then it should be. And doesn't take into account that the re-adjustment was 3 days early. So as long as the the network hashrate increases exponentially 20% increase (more or less lost of simplifying here) every two weeks we will continue to be shorted those 3 days . eventually they will add up (because the halving happens at a specific block number too not a specific time).
In short it does not matter much if the network is steady at any particular hashrate. That will be compensated for. But a continuous increase in hashing power isn't.
is my model reasonable? I doubt it. Surely we can't keep up an exponential growth of hashing power forever... at some point we should reach the point where the hashrate is increasing only as fast as the factories can produce machines? which should be linear. (at worse. I bet it becomes uneconomical long before that)

So I was a member of the Bitcoin foundation for a few months. I recently left. I joined because I thought they were a method by which the decentralized masses could communicate to the centralized governments. I was wrong. They represent the same kind of centralization governments currently have. And there is definitely an over representation of industry for a representative of people. But I think we have to see them as what they are. They represent businesses. Not people. Simple as that.
I've been working on a decentralized democracy system based on the blockchain that would solve this kind of thing. You wouldn't need to trust individual members. The project involves what i call decentralized file consensus. This will allow editing files to be both programmable and able to be done in a distributed manner. The programmability allows you to turn it into pretty much anything you like. A forum, a twitter feed, a decentralized institute for expressing the values of the crypto COMMUNITY and not the industry (which is important granted but we need our say)
 Unfortunately i don't have the development skills necessary to write this into an easy to use platform. If anyone is interested PM me please I would love to talk to you.

Not quite true. Transactions are less anonymous. They are completely public. The Identity of the person doing the transaction however is only obtainable by doing cross checking from many different sources which can be mitigated. Whereas cash requires Face to face contact. (Unless you are into the whole dead drop box spy level stuff :P). The Point being. It is possible to transact without revealing your identity.

I agree in some sense. I would prefer a foundation set up as a D.A.C (decentralized autonomous corporation) which would give the members direct control. Though the D.A.C problem hasn't quite been solved (I think I have a solution but don't have the skills to implement its myself it basically is using git but replacing head with a blockchain)
Also Like I said the Foundation has some excellent people there. Its easier to absorb and be able to keep those people then to devide and have to fight over the few people in this community
But I agree with you entirely. This won't kill us and if we handle it correctly it will only make us stronger :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:25:33
that was my thoughts exactly. Its great to notify people of the potential if they haven't already thought about this... so maybe we are just jaded from hearing this news over and over while not really seeing many people actually act on this potential. I wish I could do something to promote adoption in places its going to offer significant benefits.
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:22:58
I think that decentralized consensus gathering has great benefits for the community in general no matter which particular tools we used to make it happen. The platform is far more flexible then just replacing the bitcoin foundation. That is one potential application. I'm sure you see how powerful the ability to even have a serverless forum would be to a decentralized community. Now no one needs to host the forum. there is no person at the top with ultimate control. And thats just the first thing we have implemented on this. many many other things are possible.
The idea is that the association should be Crypto agnostic. Of course the important thing to note is that creating your own dao takes just a minute to deploy. So no matter what particular instance is created if you are not happy with it. you can either make the changes to the dao itself using the community to produce the association the people want. OR if that fails you create your own.
I hope that explains why it might be of interest to the bitcoin community...

Otherwise there is no benefit to not passing on the message.
I suppose something you could do is have the next person in the chain to be responsible for releasing the funds to you for your piece. This has the problem  that they could deny you your funds but once again at no benefit to themselves. So...

It doesn't. I believe what you are referring to is called the sybil attack. (Though I may be wrong) But any node queries many other nodes asking if they have a longer chain than what you have record of (Technically I think they look for the most difficult chain to avoid someone making a long chain by mining it on a lower difficulty.) If it find ones it accepts that as the true chain of events. Now if your attacker manages to control all of those nodes it is possible. But it does become pretty difficult to do so. I think there are other precautions built in to avoid sybil attacks (its a common problem) But I don't know what they are.

Your card would be a separate wallet address then your main one. Thats why you "load it" since the card would en essence be able to sign any transaction. You could mitigate risk due to losing your card by both keeping only a small amount in there at a time (Similar to how you only should keep a small amount in a phone wallet since if its stolen you are in trouble. You could also implement a pin method (though thats not particularly secure against someone with your card.) The point is that since the Card signs the transaction not the merchant you stay in control. The merchant's terminal sends a transaction to the card which the card then signs. this would only work with chip cards of course. Strip cards would be useless.
The signing on site isn't really as big of a problem as you think though. Chip cards are capable of a limited amount of computation. (which probably could be improved.) So its no more of a hinderance than carrying around pieces of paper. Not that paper wouldn't work. Its just messy imo.

well for a long time you couldn't get USD out of mtgox because thier accounts were frozen so the price was artificially higher because the only way to get your money out was to convert to bitcoin and do a bitcoin withdrawal. 
Its not so much that they halted the bitcoin withdrawals thats a problem. some other exchanges did it. What it is is people have simply lost faith that mtgox is competent. They designed their software and did not take into account an issue which has been known for years. now people just want their.  Furthermore they don't even seem to be trying to fix anything.

Because the US is too big to fail if they go down they are taking everyone else with them. Unless we have an alternate structure which can support us when the time comes.
You won't be completely immune of course. The economy will suffer regardless. But Bitcoin offers protection for the individual from the banks and governments of the world.
I was worried about this before I found out about bitcoin. and even if I didn't have any skin in the game I would be a huge support. The difference would be that I probably not be as active about learning all I can from programming to exchanges  about bitcoin. I admit that I am obsessive about it because I own some. But now I own "stock" in bitcoin so it only makes sense that I try to do whatever I can to help it succeed. Doesn't mean I feel differently fundamentally about it.

true sorry. I ignored that possibility because you would need to hide the notification of the second transaction from the merchant. As long as they run a full node they will notice something fishy.

Technically nothing is impossible. Some things are harder then others.
changes fall into two categories. Hard and soft forks. a soft fork is a change which the network will still see as valid. a hard fork requires the whole network (miners mostly) to change their software. Its not impossible. Its just difficult.

What is Reddit? CGP Grey says:
What is Bitcoin?
I apologize for the others who gave you a bit of a harsh welcome. In short Reddit is this site which allows posting of things sort of like a forum except reddit uses an algorithm to hide things which are not popular.
As for bitcoin it is a digital currency which is not issued by any central authority. As such you don't have to trust anyone else to take care of your money for you (like banks or governments) You can always verify what you own and everyone has a consensus that you own X number of bitcoins.
For you since you seem interested in practical application of it. Yes chargebacks are practically impossible (there are caveats to that statement which are beyond a first introduction to bitcoin). Its safe to say that once someone sends money to you they are not going to be able to reverse the transaction. 
ps. its crypto-currency the crypto is short for cryptography the means of encryption which secures the currency. 
from a practical point of view accepting payments with Bitcoin is simple you download what we call a wallet.
For a first timer i would suggest this one 
once you have a wallet you create an "address" you can give this address to people and they can use it to send you bitcoin. Its a nasty looking string of characters starting with a 1. Most of the time you will just need to copy this to an email or whatever and not have to type it out.
Its good to note you can create as many addresses as you like. So if you want to create a new one for each sale you make so you can better keep track of it you can do that. you can also send the bitcoins from your wallet. If you want to sell them for what we call fiat you will either want to use an exchange or localbitcoins.com. If you do a lot of business you might want to look into bitpay which is a service which makes a lot of this easier for merchants who sell a lot.
BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN SENDING BITCOINS just like your customers can't reverse their transactions neither can you. 
There is some more you should know. For example "transactions" are only considered secure if they have a certain number of "confirmations" this doesn't normally take long. But it can sometimes take a few minutes (typically less then an hour) you will see the transaction almost immediately but it might take a while for you to be able to spend the bitcoins. Don't worry this is just how the network processes the transaction and makes sure no one can reverse the transaction.
I'm sorry this is a bit long there is a lot to know but I'm always happy to help someone new to bitcoin figure it out! let me know if there is anything else you want to know!
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:38:34
Well not everyone wants centralization. Thats why I've been working on this!
I admit that a decentralized exchange would be awesome. But when you are developing an application you don't tend to ask for the protocol to be changed specifically for you. The community is small still and the protocol is still being defined. If there is enough need seen then by all means modify the protocol but you can't get upset if  the protocol doesn't get changed for your specific application. You make work arounds thats how any of this kind of thing works.
I wouldn't go so far to say "everyone wants centralization" just because of a choice between 40 and 80 Bytes stored in the transaction. Thats too big of a leap.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:13:32
Understandable :) It has been a rough couple months. But to be honest I have never been more excited about bitcoin. I am so looking forward these next 6 months because I truly believe this when we will have huge waves of development and reach the flashpoint.
Also take heart. We have come through these hard times largely intact. :) 
I think we both agree that there are clean and messy ways to pull out splinters in the bitcoin world. When possible it should be done cleanly.

That includes questions about they the price is doing X and "Look at this meme" It has its place and its being moderated accordingly. But its not a one size fits all. Besides the BTC-e troll box is not big enough to fit all the trolls in it. So they are bound to end up somewhere. :P
That said I would like this subreddit to be modded a little more strictly so people are at least civil. there has been some nasty atmosphere here lately.

I thought so too when i received it but I used the phone number off their website to call in which matches the one provided.
I told them they should probably make it more official since it is pretty sketchy. And I made sure when answering their verification answers that none of it would be very useful "what kind of documents did you submit?"
That said. I would prefer something a little more secure in the future. maybe mail everyone who is verified (Real mail) some sort of identification number and require it for this kind of verification. (If its good enough for taxes it must be good enough for exchanges right?)
even signing the message (even though not everyone would know how to verify it) would be better. And they really have a chance to step it up a notch here and set a better standard. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:43:06
Thats very interesting. I love Game Theory. I feel it is the best protection against our own human nature. I have no doubt that eventually we will get there. We have all the tools, Even things like reddit is itself a democracy of sorts (though not the greatest since it has the downside of favouring junky popular things and not posts like this which could have a good discussion. these just get buried) we just need to take the leap to put it all together. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 02:58:09
honestly. I think bitcoin easily has the potential to hit 100 000 within the next 2-3 years. IF it achieves its potential to full extent maybe 1 million? but thats like 20 years imo. of course I have no crystal ball to check it with. 
I'm optimistic but i'm not certain Bitcoin will be the one that hits that target. It might be something else easily. (another blockchain crypto currency)
That said I don't think it will be any of the currently existing alt coins. they don't offer sufficient benefits.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:16:56
litecoin requires 60 confirmations instead of 6 in order to have the same level of security. so it takes exactly the same time.
There might be some benefit when it comes to 0-conf transactions since you know that an attacker has less time before they will need to start racing the network.
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:55:27
um... why?
and more importantly what?
The altcoins don't matter and are not harmful. and they can only be mined and sold for what others feel they are worth. easier to mine means less valuable. simple as that. People are free to invest in whatever they feel like.

Two-Bit Idiot is actually bringing up a very important issue and I am glad that it has gotten as much publicity as it has in the community. The Foundation is currently broken. But there are good actors there working to bringing it back to actually representing the community instead of the business interests.
Speaking out against things which you deem to be wrong is good. I spoke out against how the foundation was set up when I was there. eventually some of their unilateral decisions made me delete my account and leave. There are really good players at the foundation But they are currently overshadowed by people who only have their own business interests at heart.
Admittedly its an incestuous community. It will be hard to have a foundation that does not have internal conflicts of interest. But we do still need boundaries and I really hope that this produces a positive change in the Foundation. Replace some of the industry board leaders with people more concerned with disseminating information about bitcoin then making profits. Bring it back to actually representing the community. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:16:04
The problem I see is filtering the noise. Without MtGox turning over all its data of every transaction it has ever made. How many transactions were auto-resent its pretty much impossible. Even with that data its an insane amount to process and could take a very long time to figure out which resends were legitimate and which were fraudulent. Once again this is do able. But you need to go through every transaction which was resent and then check the blockchain for the same outputs and same amount but different transaction ID. That would be a good start though it would not be perfect because you might catch people who withdraw money twice of the same amount.
Still doable but only if MtGox is completely transparent which i doubt will ever happen
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:50:22
I hope you are kidding. There is a big difference between a designed protocol and an implementation of it. Not only that but while a protocol can remain unchanged for many many years increasingly improves implementations of it can be produced introducing new features and more security. Think about the internet. Its protocols are defined but new browser versions come out very frequently. security patches, feature additions etc. same thing with bitcoin clients. you should be very thankful to the developers. solving problems with implementations like transaction malleability.
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:41:53
Yes and no? I mean I have the skills to be able to write the code. I would have to learn a lot about specifics of implementing two-three things. Blockchain, Bitorrent (communication of files and file edits are exchanged through bittorrent) and maybe Git (to track updates in a manner which doesn't require downloads of the complete file over and over). I currently am working on the Blockchain aspect. The system works on "notifications" of file edits which reference what someone is trying to do. These basically act like transactions.
My real issue is not that I couldn't learn these things. Just that it would look amateur and I do not know "best practices" which could leave my program vulnerable to attacks. If this is to be a thing people would use there has to be some reasonable assurance of security. It could take me months to learn it all (which is what i'll do if I can't find someone) or it might take someone with the necessary skills a couple hours to spot the flaws and figure out the best way to implement this.

I find it interesting that Bitcoin is mostly time travel proof. you can't take a bitcoin to a time before the output was signed to you.  what you can do is take a copy of the blockchain with you and perform easy double spends. But even releasing the blocks from the blockchain don't help since the reward address is already set. so mining is probably the way to go. Bring a 2 TH/s machine back and you can make all the bitcoins.

This was not a hostile design choice. just a choice of convenience based on where our skills lay.
Also I should note that our primary goal is not to replace the bitcoin foundation. The platform we built is very versatile. the first application we made for it is in response to Olivier's Bounty but it is really a generalized consensus gathering and decentralized governance structure. As such we figured any platform we can make it run on is a worth while endeavor

7 transactions per second is arbitrary. the real issue s blockchain size. but you do have a point the barrier to switching is lower then something like IP for now.

@_date: 2014-03-15 05:39:52
It is fundamentally a democracy of the miners. If the devs wrote code which instantly transferred all the coins to their wallets (they could technically do that) everyone would simply ignore it. That said... If every developer who works in bitcoin was in some secret agreement and the miners were lazy and didn't check the code themselves. Yes its possible that something like that could happen. The problem is everyone would know immediately. Furthermore since the blockchain is public. It would be really easy to roll back the blockchain with enough consent to undo something. 
ALSO it would be completely counter productive because bitcoin would instantly be worthless so there is no reason for them to do it. 
This kind of democracy is one of the most beautiful things about bitcoin and the blockchain

Thats a fair point there does seem to be a lack of focus. Groups like the Bitcoin Foundation attempt at this sometimes. (I was once a member) I left though because that kind of organization doesn't support the decentralized spirit.
Distributed consensus Is hard though. I have been working on technological solutions to this problem.  but in this case. I don't think we need an authority per-say. Best practises put forth by the devs should be sufficient. Follow them or face the consequences. of course while that works for software having a monetary system work like that is troublesome. The MtGox issue is an example. They did not follow the best practices and got burned for it. but they also burned a lot of their customers too.
So i guess the question is what would an authority provide that a best practices handbook wouldn't? would they have the authority to enforce them? not really...
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:51:16
This doesn't seem to be much of anything with regards to MtGox. If anything it seems Japan has taken the same stance as Canada and the UK. If you are buying with it then you have sales tax. if you are trading with it you have capital gains. "regulate" would be better replaced with "explains how to do your taxes"
The whole banks side of things is not entirely surprising. Considering that bitcoin is in general unregulated. Letting banks operate in an unregulated environment is the smartest way to proceed. Otherwise banks might find some loop hole that allows them to do illegal stuff not illegally.
None of this really says anything about exchanges.
@_date: 2014-03-02 06:27:03
I can't see the previous comment since its deleted so i'm missing a bit of context. But your response seems like just the thing this kind of scam is hoping for. Acceptance of whatever crumb they can give you in the end. It SHOULDN'T be win-win. because then there is incentive for more people to carry it out.
In short we need to make them lose. If its a lose-lose so be it but it can NOT be profitable for them or it will never end.
Edit: I should note now this ONLY applies if it is infact a scam. If this route is taken and is legitimate then the customers should be paid back the full amount no matter how long it takes in bitcoin not dollar equivalent. Maybe even some extra. They should not be allowed to steal peoples money and continue operating. and yes whether intentional or not. If they set themselves up in a situation where they only have to pay back a fraction of what they lost. It is stealing.

It took this reply for me to actually understand your lack of scarcity argument. But I think I understand now. My argument against it is that you can not turn dogecoins into bitcoins and vice versa. You can exchange them. but the exchange rate should be (if we are saying both networks offer identical abilities and value) the ratio of the number of coins.
For example lets say we had 1000 dollars in both markets but one has 1000 coins and on has 10. You would expect the exchange rate to be 100:1 alternatively you can look as one coin as adjusted to be written in pennies and another to be in 100 dollar (divisible) bills. Its just how you package up the money. so yes you have to pay more for a larger package. But you don't need to buy a whole package so there is really no issue. The higher price for bitcoin is a temporary mental block. 
Now will that mental block kill bitcoin? Its possible. I doubt it though because bitcoin offers more value currently then the altcoins. By far the Bitcoin development is far larger then the alt coins and support for bitcoin is greater making it a better transfer of value. so it truly is worth more. (though the development community still needs far more people in it and also security experts. It makes me wonder if the altcoins cause a fragmentation of development resources. Ideally improvements in an altcoin will feed back into bitcoin since they are practically forks.
As for the public opinion. That is clearly important. And it has been a bad news ~~week~~ ~~month~~ 3 months. So this argument has some validity. However 1.5 million users so far and despite news coverage the number of people who know about it is still small. 
So how can Bitcoin win? The next 6 months are going to be huge for infrastructure and lowering the barrier to entry. This will likely be accompanied by good news! Also we can break into Africa, India, south america argentina. That will be huge bringing areas of the world previous disconnected from us will bring MASSIVE value to using bitcoin since it will allow global commerce.
Can an altcoin win? yes. But it needs to offer legitimate benefits. Also Bitcoin has been the one under a microscope lately this might benefit altcoins in that they are basically shielded as Bitcoin takes the heat. So Bitcoin's name recognition is both its greatest asset and potentially greatest risk since it paints a target on it. But I can pretty much guarantee that only one who has heard of an altcoin has heard of bitcoin first and the altcoin still becomes associated with bitcoin. i.e Litecoin is an cryptocurrency just like Bitcoin.
Gunna be a fun ride!
Oh and as for the a premium paid to earlier adopters I don't really understand this thinking. If you are saying other people in Bitcoin are going to have more money then me so I am not going support it until I can find an alt coin where I can be King that is kind of petty and will never succeed as a strategy (since everyone will live in their own little currency world each having no value. The value is in that it can be used.) Also YOU ARE STILL AN EARLY ADOPTER!!!
By buying bitcoin and using bitcoin you are supporting bitcoin. buying "stock" in it which allows bitcoin to grow. and as a result you get paid for it. How is this any different from buying stock in a company that explodes in value? You invested in it early on when risk was greater and it paid off.

Ok well personally I wouldn't have use for a physical QR code since it can only be used to send funds securely (If you make one of the private key it would be pretty easy to steal all your money).

Fair enough technically free speech excludes obscenity but that is a very squishy footing to be standing on since I might find rudeness towards  each other reprehensible but others might not. At the same time you can have expectations of a code of conduct. For example MPs must address the speaker of the house and not each other (supposedly) to keep discussion civil. In court you can find yourself in contempt even if you have the right to free speech. Thats what I was getting at. Despite freedom of speech there are still codes of conduct in place.

Two things about this. The First is simple. I have a friend who works at the CBC and the government was asked today about the use of the terrorism reference and the response was that there was no official position on the matter. So possibly just puffery.
Second (kind of ranty) As far as governments go they would like a currency which they can both track all the time and control what you can spend it on. People doing illegal deeds want neither of these (many others too). But they can't have that because if they did, illegal actions would simple transact in something else. Cash is currently probably the governments worst case scenario. Its hard to track and they can't control it. In which case Bitcoin should be favorable to governments! They CAN track it. not just transactions over 10 000 dollars or what not. EVERYTHING. (and before any one says its anonymous... its not. With focused attention and surveillance a government could easily pierce the cloak of PSEUDO anonymity) 
So why aren't they jumping on board? because they have to do some work? It gives them far better ability to monitor suspected criminals then having a stakeout (with luck with appropriate warrants) .

well now the analogy is starting to break down :P the building is a democratically enforced open source protocol. The graffiti is not so much a vandalism but the choice to add a particular type of functionality. The value added to the building is not clear in both cases since no actions are limited by not including it. It simply requires a work-around. Whereas including it definitely does have a cost to the public who are the building...

The reason for a ten minutes confirmation time is a because it reduces the number of forks and orphan blocks while not being an excessive rate of growth. When blocks are found in a shorter period of time it increases the likelihood that two blocks are found in the network before they have fully propagated. this results in a fork and the block which is on the fork which doesn't grow next becomes orphaned and the reward is lost. this means that the shorter the confirmation the more wasted effort the network produces.
Furthermore if a block was found every 2 minutes you would need to wait 5 times the number of blocks as long for the same level of security. Since its now easier to grow a chain. (So you end up with exactly the same amount of time you have to wait for the same level of security)
Eventually there will be solutions to this that probably involve payment processors or something. But for right now. 0-conf transactions are typically good enough. (they ARE insecure but its foreseeable that you could track double spend attack attempts. Basically if your transaction gets to the majority of the network you are pretty confident that it will be in the next block.)
hope this helps.

Litecoin is not necessarily a "rival" it is an alternative cryptocurency with a slightly different structure but basically the same thing as Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin is "open source" (anyone can veiw the code and make changes) There are a ton of these "altcoins" as we call them. you can use them if you want but few offer significant advantages over Bitcoin. for example Litecoin produces blocks every minute instead of every 10 minutes like Bitcoin. The advantage is that things get into the blockchain faster. The problem is that it doesn't really make it more secure (at least not in typical use. It has an advantage in weeding out 0-confirmation double spends). Another downside of litecoin is that it has less support infrastructure wise and less users.

Almost certainly. But to be honest we are more interested in getting this out there for people to start working with and collaborating with us on. We started this project loooong before the bounty. But when the Bounty came out we said "we probably can do this why not give it a shot?" after the bounty is over (no matter how it turns out) we will be continuing development. :)
To be honest. Our team does not like "pre-sales" and "tokens" as a way to monetize work. We are building something we think is awesome. We are building because we can and because we nerd out over it :) If we are to make money it should not be off the platform.

I have seen you around on here a lot and normally you are reasonable and not a squid of anger. So I normally decide to not comment to you. Here though you seem particularly squidish and I am curious as to why you seem so angry. Do you own bitcoins and are angry that they are dropping in value? Do you not own bitcoins and hope that by being angry and a constant downer you alone will drive down the price? Do you just hate the ideal of bitcoin? Or are you actually jealous of the people who owned some back in 2010 (I didn't own in 2010 I own some now but not a lot. I'm making a small investment that a student can afford and hoping that one day I can pay off my debt with it I don't expect to be a millionaire.)?
For the last two options I don't understand what your motivation is for taking potentially many hours a day to browse this site and spread the poison you seem to carry. Not that I mind. You are free to express whatever you like. But I don't understand the motivation. If you don't like Bitcoin just ignore it. That would seem like the logical solution. Getting angry over what you call magical internet funbucks seems like a total waste of time.
Is there something else going on in your life that you are angry about but you can't fight that part so you find some other outlet? If so I'm really sorry for whatever is causing you the distress. If not I would like to know what motivates you.
Ps I'm not a shill. I think bitcoin has potential. In fact I truly believe the blockchain technology is going to lead to many improved systems for the internet. But I am not certain Bitcoin is going to be the one thing to rule them all. and yes I get tired of seeing people pump it up here. I'd like a serious conversation about things like 
but these things get buried under "why is it going up" "why is it going down" "why is it not going anywhere" "look at this cool picture"
But I don't feel the need to be the reaction to their action. I just do my thing and hope someone out there finds it interesting. But if not I just do my thing. Be like a neutrino.
Anyways I would love to understand what is driving you.

Hello fellow Canadian. I don't understand why it "broke your heart". I mean yeah its kind of crazy to smash your phone when there are other things they could have done with it. But they were expressing frustration in a way I assume made them feel better. Sometimes the world seems like its spinning out of control and you just want to scream. 
Will that act be heard by apple? Probably not. Will it make people realize just how anti-competitive apple really is. Making the tech world about patents and suing rather then about innovation. If they didn't realize already probably not. 
What it did do was give those people a feeling of being together in this anger. They aren't the only ones who realize whats going on. Its a rallying cry.
And they got a nexus 5 :P
If there wasn't such high walls to overcome in order to buy a new phone then there would probably be more people making a switch. Luckily I'm already android but thats because i saw what apple was becoming about a few years ago and made a conscious choice.
Don't be disappointed. Its not enough to say apple is acting in a bad manner. People have to do something about it. And these people did. It doesn't matter if their actions alone change anything because all we really need is a lot of tiny actions from people.

Hmm great idea but how to implement? Getting the big exchanges on board would be an excellent start. They could volunteer to be certified by a joint commission (though i'm sure they do their own security audits on a regular basis). But who carries it out? How to you avoid "trade secrets" being leaked? 
certificates that best practices are being employed is an excellent idea but the problem of course is how do we actually make it run so that:
1) Its useful to the customer
2) Its not exploitable by the big companies to keep new exchanges from growing.

Thanks for explaining the slightly angrier tone then I'm use to seeing from you totally makes sense now. If those stalkers are reading this I really hope they will grow up. There is no reason to target a person just because they hold a different viewpoint (Have the multitude of terrible wars not proven this yet?). I can see how this crowd could easily turn hostile. There are definitely too many shills wanting to get rich it actually detracts from having the discussions which would solve problems which would make the price skyrocket like making POS easy and simple to use. Increasing security. Creating services which allow the average joe to actually easily get into BTC and have it be useful for them.
Luckily the people working on those things are not wasting their time here. I still feel the need to be a reasonable voice in the chaotic nature of this subreddit. I just tend to lean towards the its funny how insane people can be and not directly confrontational.

Ok so there is a small issue with this. They will only have value if you include the private key with them (I suppose you could set up an intermediary for redeeming the funds but that would be kind of silly). But then you need to protect the private key in such a way that its hard to access and basically destroys the bill entirely to do so. Also when you give it to someone and say this is 5 mBTC  they need a way to verify it which is possible but in order to make it easy its probably best to design an app which can quickly verify that the bill in fact has the funds you say it does.
At that point its not really like using cash anyways. I suppose the intact seal could be the proof that it still has its value but personally I wouldn't accept it. Because it would be so easy to counterfeit one all someone would need is what ever paper you use (maybe not even) and a printer of equal or greater quality. stick a bogus address on it or better yet stick an address on it which actually contains the specified amount but whose private key is bogus.
In essence what you will have created is one time bills.
as for printing. Typical dollar bills use some kind of cotton mixture. I'm pretty sure its illegal for you to obtain any. not sure on that.

Dishonest companies are being audited by their neighbours and thereby present additional risk to the companies covering. If that risk is too great then those companies will choose to no longer be neighbours in essence kicking the dishonest company out and loosing support.
Without a very detailed analysis I don't see what incentive a company would have for basically insuring a company with bad practices. Even if they had bad practices themselves (One might be worried about a subnetwork that is dishonest). I may be wrong on that though.
I'm also worried that when taken beyond a first order analysis there are problems. I know there is math out there for that kind of thing but I haven't yet had time to go looking for it. Just a first edition to get the discussion rolling.

I am confused a little about what you are saying.


By this are you saying that when I go and buy goods or services with bitcoin that not only am I going to be charged sales tax but they are going somehow backtrack the amount I spent to me and charge me capital gains on it too?
I should note that if my understanding of this is correct then its very similar to what the UK was doing until recently which hugely stifled Bitcoin development for a while until they reversed it.


This would be discouraging to miners since they will have to pay more for their bitcoins. For example when I bought my miner it cost me 52 bitcoins. To date it has mined 52 Bitcoins (stupid pre-orders) but I have helped support the network during that time so it was worth it. What you are saying would discount how much I had to put in to actually mine. In short Mining is an investment in itself both in money and time and shouldn't be discounted.

This is how things always start. When smartphones were first a thing you rarely could find a tower that would be able to download a single webpage. When wifi was first a thing most computers couldn't use it and if you did have wifi you had to get this awkward usb stick to plug in. 
When computers were first a thing they were only a few. And you had to go find one at a university or business which was rich enough to have one. The internet could fit in an appendix even 10 years after it was first built.

Dennis from Project Douglas here. I'd like to thank Olivier for rewarding us. (The bitcoins have been received). This was the only money we will ever get for the platform itself. Its all completely open and there are no "founders shares" or any pre-sales with the Project Douglas crew. Everyone is an equal judged only by their contributions to the work.
We are constantly looking for more talent so please if you are interested in contributing please message me either on reddit or at dennis.r.mckinnon Though I should note that we are a crew of doers and less of talkers or wishers so not to scare you off because we have people of all kinds, Its important that you are wanting to build something amazing (which might involve a significant amount of your spare time eaten up) Programming skills are Ideal.
Right now we are in need of people particularly with strong understanding of network codes, p2p applications and peer discovery as we wish to implement the third piece of the  web3 platform called whisper.
Economists are welcome to discuss other methods of funds allocations without hierarchical structures (so they can be implemented in DAOs) Assurance contracts are good for one off projects or projects which are a series of well defined projects but they suffer when it comes to day to day expenses.
Mathematicians and cryptographers of course welcome. We have a lengthy discussion on incentivizing content hosting in the network which would allow us to truly replace the web that we know.
We also are working on the interface of making smart contracts real legal contracts and hopefully having DAOs as legal entities. Lawyers welcome (you will be working for free but I know there are some crypto lawyers out there who nerd out as much as we do)
Thanks again to Olivier. We were working on this anyways but the bounty kicked us into high gear to get somewhere we didn't expect to be for a couple months.

Thats not what he is saying at all. He is saying that you could make all kinds of special uses for Bitcoin to add functionality for a particular group of people but you have to consider what Bitcoin's original purpose is and whether or not adding that functionality will affect its purpose. Storing extra data has real costs to the networks. We are already worried about scalability of the network. The Blockchain is already at 20GB which isn't much right now (it would have been a huge amount 10 years ago) and increasing the amount you shove into it pushes more people away from being a node. Which in turn makes Bitcoin more centralized and defeats its original purpose. The Devs may seem like they are being overly restrictive and slow to develop but you have to remember that they are dealing with an open source protocol worth multiple Billions of dollars. Do you really want them to slip up somewhere and destroy the entire thing?

Unlike the others I actually like the fact that you brought this up. I disagree with number 1 though practically speaking its currently true. But I don't think it needs to be. You could develop a system by which all the computer resources are made available by default (or for compensation?) when not in use. I know I only get my computers up to 100% use on rare occasions. That said, we are not currently set up for this. And of course some computational tasks don't lend themselves to decentralization. Some graph theory problems come to mind. And anything for which the communication between different machines becomes the bottleneck.
That said... Its not completely out of the question. And you can imagine situations in which donating computational power could take the place of things like advertisements. (That proof of concept from MIT for example).
Number 2 I agree with completely.
The ultimate problem is that there are some tasks that just can't be efficiently broken up. This isn't a new issue though. For example if you want to write a paragraph. you don't get 500 people to write a single word. there would be too much overhead in communication to make it work. :P
Thanks for bringing this up. Its not "Bitcoin" but its bitcoin ideals. and its important to note limitations.

well I might be ignorant in this fact but i was under the impressions that in a typical case a transaction gets broadcast to all nodes on a network within 30 seconds. The only way this can be circumvented is if the attacker controls all the nodes to which the merchant is listening. There are ways to mitigate this though.
Oh I think I know what you are saying now. A node thats already received the merchants transaction won't forward the attackers? Is this the behaviour.
I'm confused as to why transactions being forwarded with priority would benefit anyone. Is your thinking so that in order for the doublespend to be more likely accepted in the next block it would have to pay a higher fee then the merchant? because only if you make it massively expensive to get significant priority over the other one would this be feasible. I guess I'm confused though. Lets say a transaction does not have significant priority and a node receives it. Is it just going to sit on it? wait for 30 seconds before forwarding it? Also if the double spend had the same fee. Wouldn't you expect it to reach at least 50% of the network anyway?
Not saying there is nothing to be worked on or improved there. Its definitely an important issue. but i really doubt Merchants will work with the bitcoin protocol directly. So its possible whatever application they end up using as there terminal could be listening on a separate network for double spends.

Nothing happens? at least not yet. Looking far into the future you can have the rich controlling governments through bribes.... but that already is happening. 
but if you are asking protocol wise.... The worst thing they can do to you is dump them on an exchange driving the price down temporarily and giving us all a lot of cheap bitcoin to buy...
Since Bitcoin is Proof of work and not Proof of stake owning more bitcoin does not give you more power (beyond that which having money in general does)
So what will happen? You will have very rich thieves (You already do(I had to include one of your expected responses)).

My goodness everyone on this subreddit seems obsessed with predictions and the fact that bitcoin is stable.
The relative stability lends support to the fact that this is not a bubble. And really just be patient. More people are becoming aware of bitcoin. But are not yet sure if they want to buy in. Once that pool gets large enough. You just need a significant movement to trigger people buying in.

Nope. they just turn bitcoins into goats and push them down a hill.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:27:19
There is a slight problem with your assumption. Miners can't put doublespends in the blockchain. At least not honest ones. Otherwise the entire protocol is completely broken. When you doublespend you hope that the merchant sees one transaction to them but a different one containing the same inputs gets placed into a block.
But that said. For the most part the cost of performing a 0 confirmation attack outweighs the reward of doing so. the easiest way to do it is to pre-mine a block with a transaction. and then you buy something within the approximately 10 minutes that the next block will be found in. and then release your block to the world. You run the risk of losing the 25 BTC reward so basically whatever you 0 confirmation doublespent in order to buy has to be worth more than 17500 dollars. How many things would you expect you can buy in 10 minutes for that kind of money. and how many places with that kind of money are going to accept 0 confirmation transactions?

then that bubble was entirely speculative and bitcoin never really increased in value. If the entire value goes to 0 or near 0 you can call all of bitcoin a speculative bubble. But I don't think that is possible (yet) there are comparisons to the dot com bubble. but that was only AFTER a ton of investment capital went into it. So the next bubble might really be a bubble :P but we will see. I mean the internet is still here and definitely worth a ton. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:11:24
well as for "more secure" than bitcoin. Bitcoin is using the highest cryptographic standards as far as I know. So if you intend to make a more secure cryptocurrency... you are going to need to do a lot of studying in cryptography.
Looking at the other explanations you have given about what you are getting at. Its a very interesting idea. Specialized bitcoin hardware will definitely increase "street" security. It will need an internet connection (in order to be able to verfy any transactions you receive). You will also need the ability to sign transactions which shouldn't be too hard. the trezor does this (once its finished). It should also have some sort of either bluetooth or NFC capability. There is a BIP about how to do point of sale securely which will be of huge benefit to you. Alternatively you could have a solid connection (the sticks plug into each other) which would be the most secure in theory.
I would also not simply rely on a fingerprint scanner. Its a neat idea but  not as secure as you might initially expect. (You have to think that if someone gets the stick they will be able to open it up and mess with the electronics unless you use a tamper proof circuity)
Overall I really like the specialized hardware idea. You just need to be careful about implementation.

In this decentralized world. We DO need to do our own investigations to hold parties accountable. Whereas normally this service would be provided by law enforcement getting a warrant. We do not have that luxury.
These hackers did what was necessary in order to get the information this community needs in order to hold MtGox accountable. Whether or not these actions are considered illegal in the real world. Here its the only way to force compliance. We have no judges to rely on. Not until the first decentralized government of the internet exists and we set up our own legal system. but that doesn't happen for a while.
Infact if MtGox were transparent about their books then this action would not be necessary. The only reason to hide this information is to lie to their customers.
as long as no damage was done and they took the appropriate precautions to avoid revealing any personal information. Then this is a service to the community and its existence should not be hidden.

well the concept is flawed to begin with. The method by which the blocks are mined and by which you find a public key from a private one are very different.
Lets assume however for arguments sake that you could just do that and were able to process the current hash rate (18000 TH/s) The key space for bitcoin private keys is 256 bits so 2^256 = more then is comprehendable and we go through them at 1.8*10^16 so it would take 6.92*10^92 seconds.4.9*10^17 seconds old. There aren't numbers big enough to describe how long this would take. But imagine it running until the universe ended and then did that millions of billions of times. Then you might be in the neighbourhood.

What if it was something like each message passed has a tiny amount of bitcoin attached to it. You know for each of the 3 hops (I believe that is standard) You could unwrap another piece of bitcoin. You then have proof of bandwidth because you are only going to get paid for the messages you pass along. The more messages the higher the bandwidth you are providing.
Only flaw I see (though there are probably many more) Is that this promotes people to try and keep the messages inside their own network or even worse repeatedly tell the sender that it didn't go through and they need to resend. I suspect there are ways around that. I mean if its just as easy to forward the message correctly as it would be to stop it. and the attacker knows that he very likely won't get the next message passed to him then there is no real benefit for not acting honestly. except to be annoying. (Unless could you fake a higher bandwidth by not forwarding messages? I'm not sure about that since this isn't really my area of expertise)

Because a "why bother trying to make improvements" attitude is what leads us to stagnant environments. 
Its possible that we can do it with less fees. The risk from a doublespend may be less which allows lower fees. competition in a regime without broken systems being propped up by regulation. These are the possibilities. If you want to try and invent a new protocol which has absolutely no doublespend risk so that you can have 0 confirmation transactions which are perfectly secure. Be my guest. I will be the second (i assume you will be the first) to buy in. But as far as bitcoin goes. We have a place for innovation in financial services which is something the western world has not seen for a very long time.

I think you mean to say with impunity. Impunity means without consequences.
The more you know.
Were you one of those people? You know why no one has rectified the situation? Uncertainty over jurisdiction. If you really want to make sure that criminals can not act with impunity on the internet maybe you should start thinking about how the internet could get its own government and justice system. The people here have proven that they are capable of tracking things down and getting evidence. Why can't we set up a government of the internet and then we will no longer need to wait for our ineffective "real world" governments to come in and save us while simultaneously stripping us of our rights in order to "protect us". We can do better than that.

The way it works is BIP38 makes it slow to make guesses. But you still need to make sure that the pool of guesses is sufficiently large. for example if i choose my password as three digits from 0-9 thats 1000 possible choices if it takes 6 seconds per guess and verification then they will crack it in just over an hour. Passwords derived from typical words are venerable to a dictionary attack in which although you have a 11 letter password the pool of names of famous characters is significantly smaller then 26^11. So just keep that in mind. Password cracking is almost a sport these days. people are coming up with ever more clever methods of searching for common keys.
One good method even for a dictionary attack is to pick between 4 and 8 random words. and put them in a sentence. such as (the XKCD example) "correct horse battery staple" if you make the dictionary of words you randomly picked from large and obscure enough you should be fine. "taciturn jungle lepidoptera forecast" for example.

If you are looking to buy bitcoin. Do NOT buy at MtGox. They currently have suspended bitcoin withdrawals. Its unclear If/when they will re-open the withdrawals. As usual choosing something like Bitstamp. Or a local exchange. Or even find someone on localbitcoins.com is probably your best bet. Don't get fooled by the low prices on Gox because its somewhat likely you will never see the bitcoins.
hope that helps

I'm sorry. I totally understand where you are coming from with this. And I accept it is frustrating. BUT your tone and method for bringing this all up are kind of hostile. 
Bitcoin is still in development. That by definition means that its not feature full. And I believe the lack of compatibility for the blind is more of an oversight then a malicious act. 
The way you should have handled this instead of venting to the internet and making the bitcoin developers (who work really hard) look like jerks would have been for you to contact them directly. Their emails are public. If they still ignored your request then you would have a right to feel slighted. Until then, Give them the chance to right this themselves before crying foul.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:05:42
Those are all excellent point and I agree with all of them. And yet also disagree too :P
So heres the problem with the top down approach, If the exchanges mutually decide who gets licenses then if you assume power corrupts, eventually you would end us with a few big exchanges which conspire to make it hard for new exchanges to enter the game. Stifling competitions and likely innovation.
I also agree that total decentralization is not possible. when a job needs to be done there are only so many packets of work it can be broken down into until the overhead required to support such a system becomes too large. However I definitely think this is in the realm of solvable by decentralization.
I love the idea of the community consensus. You are right, the correct platform does not exist. Thats why I have been working on a decentralized democracy framework. We have the technology to make it happen. When you are on the internet in a world of information. You can have governance by the people in essence. Of course there are still practical issues.
The thing i have been working on I call DFC for decentralized file consensus. Its not a new idea but it has some new features. Namely that the rules of how an organization is run is just another file that can be edited if certain criteria are met (such as a vote).
The enforcement of these rule would come about if the community got large enough since non-compliance would me no business. It would allow for both discussion and "action" (as far as action goes in a world of information)
But you bring up a good point which is always a huge problem. I refer to it as the "Expert Problem". In a system like this you want to be able to tell who the experts are. But how can you do that if you don't have enough knowledge to distinguish between them. In this case the experts clearly are the devs and the exchange operators. One thing I like seeing on this reddit is that people frequently ask to see sources. The other problem is Apathy. Why would an individual bother putting in the effort to do something or even get enough information to vote on an important issue.
A colleague of mine proposed a system for voting which is interesting but I have some small issues with it. What he proposes is that when its time to vote, you can put give your vote to someone you deem to be more knowledgeable than yourself. This would repeat until it eventually finds some experts who would have the power based in the community which could be pulled at any time. He wants it to be completely anonymous what this chain is but i think thats impractical. The other obvious issue is that in this community i think &gt;50% of the vote accumulation would probably end up with Gavin. You wouldn't get a council of experts. others might be Gmaxwell and luke-jr and Andreas but since thats the will of the people. Of course in theory Gavin could give his votes to whoever he thought was best informed on a particular issue.
Combining the two systems has some promise and could actually be carried out fairly efficiently. you can pass out vote tokens to everyone tied to a particular vote and then use transactions to pass them along. But thats all implementation. 
Anyways yeah that took a bit of a detour. I'm always really glad to have these kinds of discussions though. :)

I'd like to point out. These are not problems with the Bitcoin Protocol. This is basically a wish list of services you would like to be present. 
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE FIXED BY THE PROTOCOL
People don't use TCP directly (anymore) they use applications we need to follow this but instead of applications we need "financial services"
What we need is for people to step up and create these services on top of the Bitcoin Protocol. Bitcoin Insurance and protection systems.
We went a little overboard I think and now shun the very idea of companies working with our money. And while I agree that we need to be very careful to learn from our mistakes and not re-implement the old financial system with a new currency. That doesn't mean companies providing new financial services are evil. 
If anything this is exactly the kind of innovative environment we want! We want financial services to be competing with each other to offer us the best services possible and not to be protected by laws which stagnate the economy. Yes this means that there is risk for the consumer. So develop services for that too! For example the previous service for this kind of protection is several thousand years old. Its the legal system and its stood unchallenged for all that time. Its time we create something even better!

 Article 19 of the ICCPR states that "[e]veryone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice". **Article 19 goes on to say that the exercise of these rights carries "special duties and responsibilities" and may "therefore be subject to certain restrictions" when necessary "[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others" or "[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals".**
I'll grant you that the idea of freedom of speech has no exceptions but in practice when it comes to intersecting with other rights there are definitely restrictions. An off topic example is graffiti. Technically it should fall under freedom of expression. to take it to an extreme what if you want to "express" yourself by burning down a building or killing people? 
reducto ad absurdum is of course does not prove anything about the more sane interpretations. But it does show there is no such thing as an absolute right.

My solution to the generating new keys is to make it time consuming to create an "Identity" sort of like how you have the identity telepathic which takes time to produce enough reputation to be considered a real person. Basically you need to prove you are human over a long period of time in order to earn the right to vote. Its not fool-proof. but it could prevent botnets. Its sort of like the stackexchange system for rights.

It has its downsides thats true. but its not only used by miners and developers. When you have a copy of the blockchain you have undeniable proof of your money instead of having to rely on someone else's copy of the blockchain (or what they tell you). Its a minor thing but if you take your logic to the extreme you end up back at centralized banks. The more copies of the chain there are out there the better :)

Wallets are simply human interfaces for generating cryptocoin transactions and for reading the blockchains to find balances. since each cryptocoin uses slightly different transactions and has different blockchains to read each coin would need to be hard coded in order to understand whats going on.

I'm fairly confident that bitcoin will be around for at least 2-3 years MINIMUM in which time I feel it is highly likely it will reach 100 000. whether or not it will be the protocol of exchange for the next 20 years and achieve 1 million I don't know. That is too far in the future for me to make predictions. Not to mention in 20 years we might actually have Quantum computers which will be strong impetus for an overhaul of the protocol anyways. 
What I'm saying is this is wild speculation. but I see Bitcoin having a lot of benefits over old systems which I believe will draw people into it.
I don't see the benefit of you asking me what the price will be. Are you curious for an opinion? or are you asking whether or not you should invest. If its the latter, you need to decide for yourself. Do your research look at what areas bitcoin is poised to take over.

I agree Ghash.io going down to 30% is not really all that much of a victory. There are still 2 pools containing more than 50% of the network hashing power. Raising awareness that some of this responsibility is on the miners and they should make good choices is a bit of a victory.
You wouldn't give your voting ballot to someone why should you give your mining power to them?

incompetence? 
... I do not think that word means what you think it means
Also if someone values those 500 000 doge coin then they should be able to buy it. Bitcoin frees people to transact on their own terms. You would be no better than the banks if you told people what cryptocurrencies you could and couldn't buy.
As for "Dilution" The only thing i can figure you are referring to is people's perception of cryptocurrencies. And I agree this might cause a temporary user base split. But whichever one has superior support and features will win out in a free market. That will very likely be bitcoin since no other coin has offered truly significant advantages over bitcoin and bitcoin has more support.
So why do you feel personally threatened? Is it that you want to be on the "winning team" If thats the case what you should do is work on making bitcoin a more lucrative choice then any other altcoin. build support in the community. don't try to tear others down.
in otherwords... Don't be an Apple

If you are right about the green spike then the red spikes might be forwarding transactions.

The purpose of the decerver is to act as a middleware of sorts. Yes 2gather takes calls for videos and sends them to ipfs the filesystem we currently have a module built for but it doesn't need to. You could module for any filestore you like and expose those functions to ate so that the javascript running on the decerver can access it. Its a multi-purpose extendible glue. Furthermore in the 2gather example thats not ALL the decerver is doing. 
The larger part of the the logic of the application is built on smart contracts. Instead of storing the videos on the blockchain we store pointers to the content stored in ipfs. we could just as easily use magnet links if we had the module. The smart contracts stores informations about accounts, posted videos. controls who has access and provides built in administrative/moderation functionality. This could not be done by IPFS alone. The reason i think you have only found the stuff regarding IPFS is because due to the fact that IPFS has provided their own server, its actually far simpler then going through the module we wrote for it. therefore those interactions are "closer to the surface" if you wish to see the component relating to the blockchain i would suggest taking a look at  where most of the blockchain smart contract interaction is coded. This will become increasingly simple over the future iterations and it is entirely possible that the decerver as an application will boil away completely. but for the moment. this system is a huge improvement over our first attempt last summer which involved a massively unweildy set of ruby scripts to connect blockchains and bittorrent.
I hope that helps answer your question.
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:49:53
I would take the position that there is functionality available that does offer value. What else would you use to communicate between bitcoin a smart contract chain and something like IPFS. It works its not ideal but it works. 
If you can point me to specific things that are not possible at all (not just less then ideal) I will speak to Casey and Preston and get them to correct it. Thelonious does allow you to spin up new chains with custom permission settings. you can do EVM based consensus scripting (But i would agree that its highly impractical at this point) Epm works. The decerver can run back end Javascript to interact between decentralized technologies.
 "My research and conversations with you lead me to believe that any value that the Eris stack has to offer is still in development."
Of course. If it wasn't under continuous development then there would be no point in caring at all. we all know that once development stops on a project (and on the value that project is trying to provide) then the project is dead. There is no active project out there from linux to git to docker to us that is not working on their value.
But like I said if there are specific passages that you feel are grossly misrepresented I will look into getting them corrected.
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:41:18
The abstraction is implemented in the sense that you can write the module exposing the functionality to any filestore you like and use it. We have limited resources as a team and therefore picked a few of our favs.
However I do agree that decerver need not be a fully fledged application. the next "version" if it deserves to be even called that will be node.js libraries and probably a set of docker tools for quickly setting up "decerver" (in the sense that it acts as a decentralized server of the web application) instances.
But please keep in mind we are a small team and we did not go the route of a massive crowd sale and instead pursued VC funding like a normal startup would. And as such there is only so much we can do at any given moment. we try not to promise that which we can not give. That said there are many things we are excited about pursuing and you have touched on a few of them to be sure.
decerver is capable of scripting access to any functionality you have a written a module for to expose functionality. I believe 2gather has bitcoin tipping functionality. At the very least i know when i wrote the smart contracts for it it stores the bitcoin address. But we designed the decerver to be extendible with more functionality. Part of the problem is that go does not allow dynamic linking so you would have to recompile for each module you wished to add. This is why we have started work on dockerized services sort of set up. Because we want to move towards making the structure better and in the end the decerver will be a library. So you are right on the ball with that. I'm really glad you invested the time to really understand what we are trying to do. (evidenced by the fact that you are suggesting future courses of action which make sense) Its refreshing. I will admit its not perfect. but nothing is. At least it works which up to now scriptable interaction between the decentralized technologies has been a real pain in the ass. This is our attempt at simplifying the process.

Percent adoption will probably be a determining factor. If you look at the M1 of the world (essentially cash) and say bitcoin replaces 1% the prices should be 10000 dollars approximately. Of course thats just assuming cash is replaced. You also have to think about what is probably an easier direction for it to grow into. Online payments. Replacing Paypal, Visa, Interac Online. this is significantly smaller number In which case Bitcoin is overpriced already considering level of adoption. We are probably in a lul for a bit price wise. We have the worlds attention. But we need to catch up. Make it usable develop infrastructure have more businesses adopt it. Allow more people to become familiar with it. I have a theory that when 1 in 20 people know about bitcoin or own some we will have reached critical mass and there will be a huge surge of adoption.

Constitutions don't work. Nobody can plan for 200 years of corruption on a document (except Hari Seldon). What is important is that the citizens are actively engaged in their own democracy. That is the only true protection. The lack of outrage by people today for our fundamental rights being stolen from us is saddening. We shouldn't just not like it. We should all be absolutely pissed! Bitcoin is fundamentally  democratic. The only way it will be corrupted is if we as a collective allow it. Its not enough to just build the system. We have to watch it and ensure that it is not subverted. That powerful people can't change the rules to suit them.
Its up to us. I'm glad there is so much discussion about these things. Its a good start.

I see two places altcoins fit in to the future picture.
The first is. They are obviously very speculative. In fact as Bitcoin becomes more and more stable (currency-like) I expect altcoins will take over the investments side of things. They are like the stock market today though not really tied to anything. I could foresee a future where an altcoin of sorts could be used as a stock for a company. It would have to be modified of course and wouldn't satisfy decentralization as well. you could have the company produce a certain number of these coins. Sell them to others for Bitcoins. and then they can be traded. It would actually be a very elegant system. You would have to restrict the production of coins only to the company but still.
The second service I see is as a testing ground for future features in Bitcoin itself. The alts don't need to compete. They can show what features are useful tested in a real world environment (not a test net) and if sufficiently useful it can be pulled into Bitcoin in some ways. Bitcoin must be stable. But it must also evolve. We can't assume that Bitcoin will be in the same form it is 50 years from now.
The war is not with the alt coins. Its not even a war. We need to be quicker at building the infrastructure around Bitcoin. 
Ps the Bitcoin foundation is not in the business of telling people how they can use software. Or which they can use. They will not take a stance on altcoins I don't believe. They work for promotion of Bitcoin and paving the way for easy adoption and that's what they should continue to work on. Discussions about other things occur but mainly their work is for helping centralized authorities communicate and learn from decentralized ones. It might seem like they do nothing. But they do good work in Law and policy, regulation, and education. They aren't going to be the police force of crypto currencies.
Did you consider that maybe this has gotten too much media attention too soon? That maybe having a bit slower of an adoption for a year might be a good thing while we get the systems set up?

But are these loans true loans? Or do they only work because we currently have magic money machines producing fiat that we can balance against? I'm having trouble picturing an insulated bitcoin economy (where people no longer convert to dollars). There would be economic benefit to lending bitcoins to someone to start a business. but it might not be immediately obvious what it is since there is still risk. So I guess banks could still take large amounts of peoples money. invest it. and lose out and not be able to pay everyone back. That would be bad. Say if they were hacked.

There is an interesting problem like this called the birthday paradox (though its not really a paradox) that talks about the chances of collision the more random entries you put in. If i recall if you are trying to guess a single hidden answer then it is of order N attempts you need. Does that mean its impossible with such an extraordinarily unfathomably big number of possibilities? no. but the expected time to crack one is so large and the probability so small thats its practically negligible. 
To the second part if many people are doing this what are the chances of collision? this is where the birthday paradox comes into play. it can be shown that your expected number of attempts before succeeding can be sped up by a quadratic  factor. so instead of order 2^256 you now have order 2^255. Which pretty much makes no difference at all.
I thought about this at one point but no. its not a venerability practically. you might say that even our best security methods are simply extreme forms of security by obscurity but thats sort of a fuzzy area.
Now brain wallets. Those you can hack by the described method since words and password have way lower number of possibilities (entropy).

What I was trying to address was that the previous post at the time was talking about how there is nothing we can do. I was pointing out that its not over. we are too use to not having any say against an entity like the government. In this we DO have the power. And as long as we are vigilant and take action against these kinds of threats. Bitcoin will continue to stay free. It will only be controlled if we let it.

There is a lot of hate directed at the Bitcoin foundation right now. I joined the foundation so that I could participate in this discussion precisely. (A $25 fee is worth being able to actually have a say). People saying they have no right to represent us are absolutely correct they aren't elected by the general assembly of bitcoiners. However they work as a decent interface from a decentralized form of organization (us) to the centralized form of organization (the governments). As long as they represent the viewpoints of the collective all is well. And if they don't we can pull our support. That being said nothing I have seen has shown Mike Hearn was not pushing for redlisting. Just calling for a discussion of what the official position of the Bitcoin foundation should be. I strongly oppose this being supported by the foundation. I don't think it will solve the problems that its supposed to solve considering there is already a public ledger. But to come to that position without discussing it with the community would be definite grounds to rebel against the bitcoin foundation. So far i have seen no untoward behaviour. the majority of posters are anti-tainting. And the pros have yet to demonstrate any benefits. But having the discussion is not prohibited and doesn't mean the Bitcoin foundation is evil just because it was discussed.

I agree with all of this. Its not that there aren't interesting topics produced but they instantly get flooded to the bottom of the new pile within minutes.
I would say lets just all go start our own subreddit. (bitcoin banhammer might be a bit too aggressive in their mission statement) The problem is even though there are thousands of get rich quick people coming on here getting excited that the price has hit a new all time high. there are a few new people who are genuinely interested. As much as I hate wading through shit. Finding those few people who are experiencing the wonder at the potential of bitcoin and helping them is worth it. And if we leave then those people would be left with only the meme creators and price posters
That said,
Cutting down a bit on the shit would not hurt. As it is those new curious people are also buried under 7 feet of shit and this subreddit is only amplifying the mania surrounding bitcoin that has led to both the insane run ups and the insta-crashes.

I have been thinking of something like this for a while. Something that you can't do right now but might be useful sometime in a future be if you could verify a public key identity (likely with a company), You could then sign assets to that identity. For example you could sign over your bitcoin address to your identity thereby proving you own both.
The benefits of this go beyond this particular instance. If the company enforces the strictest KYC routines then instead of signing up all the time and getting verified everywhere you simply answer a challenge from the company that wants to verify you. Passwords for websites would no longer be necessary. And potentially one of the more interesting possibilities would be internet justice. Lets say a person is a scammer. You could report their ID to some sort of decentralized internet justice system. If proof seems sufficient then punishment can be exacted in the form of suspension of key recognition. Of course checks and balances would need to be in place. Also it would solve the problem with voting. We could have truly representative voting. Possibly even implement elections or something similar because the identity could be trusted.
some problems but overall an interesting idea no?

as for the fast hashing i'm not sure if thats a problem or not. After all how do you know when you are done? You can essentially unscramble to any valid private key (thats the basis of the one time pad) I only used the Hashing function to quickly generate a random seeming but reproducible digest of a particular length to use as the one time pad.
Also having a single share should not make things any easier for similar reasoning to the one time pad arguement. Without the  share the secret could be any of 59^len(message)
Unless i'm missing something of course

Thats a very interesting point. Of course the question really becomes which will be cracked first the Elliptic curve cryptography (Through quantum attack)? or the SHA256?

you could try buying BTC at mtgox. Transfer to your wallet and sell with localbitcoins.

Easy security. But that might mean specialized hardware. If you could have something that allows secure transactions in a card like format that would be awesome. especially if it could potentially work with existing hardware like card readers at grocery stores. Could you do that? If you could that would amazing for bitcoin.
Another thing you can do is develop a method for tracking coins through the blockchain. Just a tool that makes something like the sheep marketplace theft tracking easier then looking at blockchain.org.
Other then that... You could look into developing contracts.
my understanding is they don't yet work on the bitcoin network. But if you even got the m of n working on testnet for escrowless mediation that would be amazing (and you probably could start a service/company)
I've also been thinking about a decentralized know your customer service where you validate a private key identity that you can then associate bitcoin addresses to in order to to not have to always go through account validation proceedures on every site or exchange.

Luckily for me dictionary attacks won't work that well on this particular implementation since the password i used was a random collection of numbers and letters (upper and lower) and symbols greater than 8 in length but you are right a poor password is likely the weakest link in this thing. maybe including something like a pin number that is added to the hash would be a good thing if it is 4 digits thats 9999 times they have to search for your password. 
I don't like relying on the hardness of the hashing routine for security because all that means is someone sufficiently determined could reasonably attack this. Good password creation is something people should just learn or we should use private keys to identify ourselves online.
What the attacker (you in this case) has is the private key combined with the hashed password in one-time pad style. You don't have the hash by itself which means in order to attempt a brute forcing you would have to know what the hash is SEPARATE from the private key but at no point do you have this (unless you have compromised the computer itself in which case we have bigger problems).
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:15:32
It can be prevented. Bitcoin is fundamentally a technocracy. It votes based on mining power. So yes we can stop "clean" address listing by getting the majority of hashing power to not accept transactions from them. However stopping people from keeping track of "bad" addresses there's nothing to be done about that. but who in their right mind would not accept bitcoins just because they come from a questionable address. It doesn't make sense. The important thing is that nothing is impossible with bitcoin. We the bitcoiners are in control of the future of bitcoin. For all their posturing the government and the companies do not own this. This is ours. We must protect it. But don't forget nothing happens to it without our accepting that change.

The only thing stopping someone from doing a 51% attack at any point is that its not finacially  a good move unless your goal is to crash bitcoin. why would you want to make your money worthless? also do you know what they can do with a 51% attack? It sounds horrible but all they really can do is block transactions going through and double spend in places that accept 1 confirmation transactions.

wow 500M h/s... Thats a lot. Switching to a slower hashing algorithm definitely makes sense in that case. You would need... a string of 8 random alphanumeric characters to make that unfriendly (assuming a 10x increase in hashing power in the nearish future)
Certainly glad I used my alpha-numeric-symbols password with this one...
Slower Hashing is going on the modification list!
I'm working in base 59 because the easy to read private key format is in base 58. I need a prime number so that every integer has an inverse. My reasoning was that if someone is going to use this they probably have the easily human readable form of the private key already and want to add further protection. however there is no reason you can't modify all of this to work more automatically. You could even get fancy with specific applications of it to have shares on a laptop and a USB key and to have the private key automatically reconstructed.
If you really wanted to you could modify this to split your whole wallet.dat file into multiple parts that can only be reconstructed if you put your usb key in your laptop. But I thought I would start with a simpler implementation and I already had the intmod class written from a previous project so why not?
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:38:40
not really sure. It hasn't happened yet. If it was a malicious entity it is basically a security feature. they can't tamper without consent of 51% of the network. If this hard fork comes because not everyone adopts the changes immediately. It would cause a period of time where certain transactions may or may not be accepted for a while. It would be bad if let to go on for a while thats why changes are carefully considered. and if a hardfork becomes necessary they will probably implement as many things in one go as possible so as to keep stable most of the time

The "keys" people talk about are what is known as private keys. There is a type of encryption known as asymmetric encryption. or more frequently called public key encryption. In this type of scheme there are two types of keys, a public key which everyone can know and can be used to encrypt stuff. and a private key that can decrypt. These schemes can also be used to "sign" things which is a means to verify that you the owner of the private key has sent a message or similar action.
In bitcoin what you are doing when you transfer money is signing that transaction (authenticating it) to the network. Those private keys that allow you to make signatures are what your wallet is. Without it you can't use your bitcoins. and if someone else gets it THEY can use your bitcoins. Since your bitcoins are never actually physically stored on any device. As such its very important to hold onto your wallet. Maybe encrypt it. etc.
When you have an account on an online bitcoin wallet. You don't actually have the keys yourself. You trust the website to keep your keys safe. This is a remarkable bad idea.
Depending on what type of app you have on your phone  its either the same as your wallet on your computer. or it links you to an online service.
Hope that helps

technically nothing. BUT nobody would use a bad version of bitcoin. Because what versions you run are up to you. Thats part of the problem with updates that cause "hard forks". fundamentally different protocols that are not compatible.

Right sorry. Its because i'm using the integers mod 59 in order to encompass the base 58 alphabet. Got mixed up jumping back and forth. The rest of the math holds though?
I would have gone with integers mod 58 but since 58 is not prime you can't be assured that every element has an inverse which is rather crucial to the algorithm.

Some things will require "hard forks". Its unclear at this point what effect that will have on bitcoin. Unless there is network wide co-ordination you essentially have bitcoin becoming its own altcoin. It is possible that instead of this, you would simply have a superior altcoin eventually take over. As long as it was entirely compatible with existing infrastructure you could simply plug in the new protocol at some point. Also its possible that in the future multiple coins will be useable with layers on top which makes them compatible. 
Will this happen? Maybe. Will it happen tomorrow? No. None of the altcoins have any real benefit to date.
Will it make Bitcoin fail? Depends on what you call failure. It bitcoin ushers in a new era of digital money allowing commerce and co-operation across borders bringing the world closer together. Then even if it goes out of use I would say its a success. Similarly if the internet were replaced. Doesn't mean the internet failed. We need to leave ourselves open to the idea of redesigning our systems whenever they are no longer useful.

I'm not sure if you are aware of bitcoin contracts. But they are probably one of the most awesome things about bitcoin. We are not even using a tiny portion of the capabilities of bitcoin that are already built into the code.
here is a link in nearly indecipherable techno talk:
and here is a youtube video of a talk mike hearn that describes it in english:
Definitely worth a look. The reason I bring this up is many people do not realize the true potential of bitcoin to revolutionalize aspects of our life beyond simple currency. new and creative methods for using it are being created everyday like the guy who incorporated a business that did not have any existing government certifying it. He used the blockchain as a notary.
I think this more then the price swings or silkroad are the important things to know about bitcoin. people compare it to the internet or email. though a pretty good comparison, I think its more like Linux in the sense that its an open source platform that allows people to build new and interesting things on top of it.
Good luck with the movie. I will be going to see it!

There are many options available to you. A paper wallet is essentially a piece of paper with both the public and private keys printed on it. In your Bitcoin-Qt your wallet file (wallet.dat) is located in %Appdata%\bitcoin i believe
You can get to %appdata% by typing that into the windows search bar in the start menu (assuming you are using windows) I don't know where it is stored for other systems. 
Encrypting your wallet (which bitcoin-Qt can do) is probably a good measure for security. There is also Armory wallets which is supposed to be even more secure.
Personally I don't like the paper wallet idea. Too easy to accidentally loose. I'm more of the encrypt your wallet. and then maybe save a further encrypted copy on a USB that you keep in a safe deposit box.
You can be as paranoid as you like.

For dumping. Yes its a problem. It would also be a problem is China sold all the USD it owns. Could trigger a global economic collapse like we have never seen. but it would also hurt china. In fact it feels like these days people have faith in the USD not because it deserves it but because anything else would be devastating. Similarly why would someone want to crash the market and lose all their value?
If it we achieve currency like status this will no long be a problem. people with large reserves would just pay for everything in bitcoin improving the economy.
The second one is more interesting. People have certain absolute requirements. food shelter etc. so they will be spending it. the question is will they spend it frivolously. And the answer is as far as i know we don't know. this leads to something i have been thinking of.
Debt/loans in bitcoin. If you want to loan bitcoin from a bank. the bank must have exactly that amount of money to give you. no more money from no where. no more credit card debt (until someone thinks something up) but all the money must eventually add up to the total bitcoins. This is good cause banks can't do stupid things like sell mortgages that lose money (at least I think, I'm not an economist). And the interesting thing is that by loaning money. the bank contributes to the improvement of the bitcoin economy. making the bitcoins they receive back worth more overall. So potentially interest-free loans might be possible. 
Its very interesting. This is quite the experiment.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:19:41
Right you did say byte sized numbers. So in essence three favourite ASCII characters? I suppose that that should be enough. Of course since we are working in base 59. You could have a sequence of 5 base 58 characters and that would provide 714M increased search space. 
I'm not exactly sure how many SHA512 hashes you can do per second (maybe i'll run a quick test) if it is around 1000 h/s and if they knew your password then it would take 8 days to crack. If its significantly faster (which i believe it probably is) then it could take less.
honestly I don't know why people don't just create strong passwords. I have one password that is simply a string of letters numbers and symbols (it was a default password). Was it hard to remember at first? Yes. Was it worthwhile? Yes. I use it for things that require top security. 
Of course a word + 5 alpha numeric values (completely random)  would be pretty decent password. 
I might go in and change the hash algorithm though to something like you suggested. Maybe Hash(Hash(password)+password) or a couple more iterations. That should defeat rainbow tables right? 
Passwords are annoying though. What I would like is an NFC ring with a tiny amount of processor power (I've heard this is being worked on, i know the rings exist but NFC currently is not able to do any processing) Your ring would have a private key tied to a public key identity. In order to log in a device would request your ring to sign something or answer a challenge using it's key. Then you wouldn't need passwords at all. Wouldn't that be nice? (For High Security like Banking you could still have passwords but for the thousands of sites we use no longer would we need to bother with that.)

This was a very interesting read. Not sure I followed everything in depth but looks good. 
A couple of questions.
1.) You make the assumption at the start that all blocks are of maximal size. In practice this isn't the case. Since this could make propagation of smaller blocks faster does this place any sort of pressure on mining smaller blocks? If so can you think of some method for rewarding full blocks more fully? (This is already an issue I believe i am interested in your veiwpoints)
2.) Can un-even propagation threaten your security assumptions? Either from smaller blocks moving faster or Lets say that someone (say a telecommunications company) sets up some nodes on ultra low latency networks. If they were honest this would in theory decrease loss but what if they were dishonest and selectively propagated blocks. They could in essence update the majority of the network faster then otherwise possible.
And one last question. Would it be possible for someone to run a scan of the bitcoin network similar to the scans of the internet that have been done and construct a network graph which simulations could be run on? Or is this impractical/ not useful?

I've been with bitcoin for almost a year now and understand most aspects of it. One thing that i'm still uncertain about is in several years the cap of 21 million bitcoins will be reached after that point the total amount of accessible bitcoins will be on a slow decline as people lose their wallets occasionally. Not that the bitcoins will be gone but nobody can use them making less of them available over time. I assume that since bitcoins are divisable to such a large extend that the values will just increase a corresponding amount even if there were to only be one bitcoin left in circulation. Is this correct? Or am I wrong about this? There is a definite limit to this process since bitcoins are not infinitely divisable. Though this event could be many many years in the future it is strange that there is a perceivable death of bitcoins. (I'm sure other things will happen first, miners shutting down their machines allowing a 51% attack)

QR codes are read by the camera. Almost everyone has a camera and the necessary software to read it these days. NFC would (will?) be way more convenient but it requires the majority of people to have that capability which currently isn't the case.
If someone designed an NFC device that was card-like, easy to carry in your wallet. That could sign transactions. We might be able to use some current tech to implement a system. But this would have to be a NFC that has a little processing capability too. I have heard this is being worked on but not quite there yet.

In that case very cool. I have been pondering similar problems as of late. I want to create decentralized Tor-based mail-servers. Essentially each one is a node running hidden services.  The problem I was having is establishing a first time encrypted connection without accessing external servers for pgp keys or such. Since that would give a clue as to who was being contacted. I want it so nobody knows who was being emailed. what was being emailed. or who sent the email except the two end parties. Not an easy thing. I wonder if something like this would work for that or not.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:17:24
Haha yes the password is to keep the thieves out. But since it is one time pad (you only have access to privatekey + hash(password)) I don't see how the particular hashing algorithm used matters. I would understand if you had hash(password) it would help to make it nasty. 
the two avenues of attack I see are brute force the whole thing. OR brute force the password to create hashes and try to find the privatekey from using the more limited password space (though since it is a hash digest I assume you can essentially choose any size password you like) Though now that i think about it. Making it a nasty scrypt hash procedure would deter people from attacking the password. its not information theory security... Its more like storing your diamonds in the bottom of a barrel of sh*t security. Yes you could go after it. But you don't really want to :P
of course as time goes on the barrel gets shallower and shallower. So I want to ensure that the algorithm is secure assuming worst case scenario that it is easy to hash.
Also is a checksum really necessary in this? I mean after the split there is no guarantee that any behaviours from before are going to still exist. Infact it would be a risk if they did.... I simply convert into integers mod 59 (with b58conv) and then take that and encrypt it as is with no assumption that any checksum should hold. Shouldn't that be more secure than limiting the share-space?

"The Foundation" is not the only one. There are several all over the world.  They are probably just the most publicized one. The foundation also doesn't rule over Bitcoindom.

Its hard to find exchanges that will allow purchase of a few dollars worth of bitcoins. However I'm sure you can find someone on localbitcoins who would be willing to let you get your feet wet. Honestly you are probably better off investing $100 now and waiting and seeing then doing smaller amounts over time. If you assume the worst case scenario and it becomes worthless you have lost $100 dollars. but if bitcoin is successful (which all signs point to, not just me hyping it up but it has gained some serious ground, still has a long way to go) then you will make far more this way.
I know the fear to jump in though. I thought I was absolutely insane for investing $1500 nearly a year ago. But I invested what I could afford (but did not want to) lose and it paid off with a 26X return.
Don't be too afraid. We aren't at the top yet. buy $100 dollars of bitcoin or whatever you want. And just sit on them for a year. You'll very likely thank me a year from now.

most likely scenario to me is its superceded by an altcoin that shows SIGNIFICANT improvement over bitcoin. However Bitcoin already has dozens of features built in that we are not even using yet.

I don't think there will be much of any particular type of slant from the coverage. The government is excellent at doing nothing. If it was something like the supreme court making a ruling that would be different. But we are going to watch a bunch of men sit in a room and listen to people talk about bitcoin.
Long term policy? I don't think the US wants to take a negative stance. I think its clear now that Bitcoin is not just a fad. It survived the first pop. It recovered. There is more interest then there every was before. Its starting to actually develop as an economy (still long way to go) but you would have to be insane to not want a piece of the action. And the government can't effectively tax something it makes hard to participate in.

The original key space is 59^len(key) correct, In otherwords the probability of any randomly selected key is (1/59)^len(key)? Given one share you can look at what possible values in the second share could be. for each character there is precisely 1 value it can be out of 59. Over the full message this gives (1/59)^len(key) probability of a random guess at the second share giving you the original key. Same as if just bruting it. and the keyspace 59^len(key) is sufficiently strong I believe for protection (Otherwise you would be able to brute force any private key).
The purpose of this exercise is not just to go get some of-the-shelf software and use it. Anybody can do that. I wanted to learn something. Make something. And then test whether or not I did a good enough job. After all the Armoury people built some system themselves and tested it. Why can't I?

The choice to encode every character with a separate polynomial was deliberate because you know that the first character of the key is 5. Which means if you have k-1 shares you should be able to crack the whole key. This way even if you figure out the polynomial for any particular set of characters the integrity of the rest are still maintained. 
I'm not entirely sure what the checksum you are referring to is...
Password hashing is not for transmission on a network it is to avoid having to come up with a 51 character password.  Since the output of sha512 is always 64 bytes (If i'm not mistaken). The hashing algorithm is not to add security in itself, just to turn what is likely a short password into a longer hash digest which can then be used as the (easy to remember) one-time pad.

There is no real way of telling for sure and stability is relative with bitcoin but a good way to judge is where the bottoms of the flash crashes are.
Today we flash crashed (On Mtgox even though I don't use gox as my gauge for price) from 1070 ish to 925 ish. plus a near immediate recovery. That says to me that we probably won't see below 900 again or if we do its only because of a massive crash. So yes i think 1000 is sustainable.
The problem is that the majority of the price of bitcoin is still speculative. The infrastructure to set up the economy has not been put in place. We need more businesses that accept pure bitcoin. After that we need people to accept bitcoin for rent. and then we need bitcoin accepted for larger things like down payments on houses. I'm not sure if you will ever be able to get a bitcoin loan though. It seems fundamentally problematic, at least not the way banks do it today. So the price is basically bets on what the price will be in a combination of the short and long term. 
short answer. Yes
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:42:00
The key space though is still 59^len(key) which is the same as the original key. After all the problem has become one of trying to brute force the one time pad.
Your second point is very good though. There could very well be some leaked entropy from that. But I would need to do the calculations very carefully to see how much this affects the security. I don't know what the distribution of sha512 is though...

I'm not sure politics is the correct word. If you had a Loonie and I changed it out for 4 Quarters would you be so upset? You still have the same value but in different denominations. Same would be true with Bitcoin. But it wouldn't be decided by a single individual. It would be a response to the need of people having to pay things in less then a satoshi. And unless we stuck our heads in the sand until satoshis were worth more then a dime or somewhere around there. We would be fine.
