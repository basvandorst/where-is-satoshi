Simply because it seems the BU is about to win the scaling debate. Antpool is huge and respected in the mining community. Others will likely follow soon and the deal will be done. So it will be BU that is majority and the official Bitcoin network. Which will be fine. We will also get to have Segwit and Lightning and this terrible stalemate will be over.

I love bitcoin and have been involved since 2012. But I won't go down with a ship if this ship sinks. The Core vs Big Blocks issue has torn the community apart and development is stagnant. Smart money will not go down with the ship either, it would be stupid to do so, so we've got to hope this situation is resolved but we can't be stupid and arrogant... Myspace can happen to ANY first mover. Betamax, HDDVD, Myspace so forth were all great technologies... Lets fight to makes sure it doesn't happen!

Segwit isn't being blocked by anyone. It simply has never gained much support over 23% of the network in the four months since release. It would need to climb to like 70% before it was being blocked by BU.

The post Satoshi Gavin years were the most productive and successful years in Bitcoins history. Everything since... the 'New Core' years has been a catastrophe. They have turned the community into a cesspool with toxic, gas lighting, bullying leadership, and support to divisive deletions and banning. They can make some good code, but their vision of Bitcoin has nothing to do with what Bitcoin was designed to do, or the original plan for how it was to proceed forth.  BU plus a malleability fix like Segwit and Lightning would be fantastic super Bitcoin going forward.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:49:07
Exactly what has happened. The big blockers aren't just for big blocks... they want Core no longer in control. They want decentralized development with many clients, many minds from many teams. If Core was still one of those teams I'd be happy. Decentralized development could actually make Bitcoin stronger. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:03:34
Roger Ver only really joined up in a real way last summer. Big blockers were a thing long before he took a leadership role. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:41:51
They don't support it because they've been telling Core for years they want bigger blocks as was always the plan since the beginning. Core ignored them and now miners are ignoring Core and starting to support BU which is more in line with the original concept of Bitcoin anyway. The blocksize was always getting bigger... it just had the cap at 1mb... BU allows that cap to be increased or decreased as needed. Nothing all that bad about that. Plus we could have a malleability fix... be it Segwit or similar... and Lightning too... we can have it all. Lets put an end to these high fees and network clogs by using the way Bitcoin was designed... then we can have the other fun stuff too. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:07:02
It has nothing to do with politics or me saying so. Bitcoin was designed in a manner that 1 hash = 1 vote. That is how Bitcoin works. If the miners support BU that becomes the majority chain and the official Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto designed it this way... and it has functioned this ways since the start.
I have no say in the matter but now the writing is on the wall which is why people are freaking out here. With Antpool supporting BU, it will soon have nearly DOUBLE the mining support Segwit has. The remaining miners currently supporting 8MB blocks will probably fall in line. That is how Bitcoin's consensus system works.
Afterwards Segwit or a similar malleability fix would be adopted, and Lightning too. The stalemate will be over. I wouldn't be surprised if quite a few of the Core devs actually help out with BU. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:09:38
Valid will be whatever has the majority hashing power based on the rules of Bitcoin. BU might eventually have to experience a similar event when some other client is deemed better. They might kick and scream... but it won't matter... the majority hashing power determines what Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:00:16
Then keep yourself purposefully half in the dark. That sub at least allows for the full story to be communicated. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:45:43
Core was already taken over though... like Core doesn't have any of the original superstars that guided the protocol during its most successful years. It isn't the original team in anyway whatsoever. There is cross over, many hold overs... but the people that made bitcoin what it is are gone. The current team is trying to make it something else, they have some great ideas, but much of the community isn't impressed. I feel BU and Segwit+Lighting would be a great final outcome. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:44:04
The Core side really believes Core is in charge. They are very talented coders... but their insistence on centralized planning via a single team leads to group think and has lead to this situation. More teams would be fantastic. We should have Segwit and BU,Classic, Core all together. Many different teams along with Core to make a stronger whole and have less fighting. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:01:41
That number two position is going to eat Bitcoins cake at this rate. 25% marketcap of BTC. Any smart investor should diversify for the possible event of this happening. Love bitcoin but don't be foolish with your money. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:46:41
Yes, same thing happening here with BU. People need to listen and communicate more. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:00:33
The POS system coming out next year puts an end to supply. Supply will be locked and in fact have less inflation than Bitcoin for many years afterwards which is kind of cool.
@_date: 2017-03-13 02:41:34
I don't see why the Core devs involved in Lightning and Segwit wouldn't want to be involved. Do they believe in Bitcoin or just themselves? 
If BU majority chain happens, Segwit or something similar, along with Lightning would be fantastic. I would seem a large portion of the BU supporters quite like the idea of BU+Segwit+Lightning. If decentralized development happens I would seriously hope Core stays involved... why throw in the towel? Some kind of tantrum reaction? How about prove to the whole community... the BU side as well that they truly love Bitcoin even if they have to share the development in a different way. If their ideas are as fantastic as they say they will be... and those concepts do seem great... then those ideas will be accepted as they should be. Core do its part to help heal the community this way.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:32:10
Segwit hasn't been blocked by anything. Even with BU's rise in hashing support to 40% as of today... it isn't actually blocking Segwit. Segwit grew to about 23% support and never got higher than that in about four months of existence. It needs 95% as per its design. For a long time Segwit should have needed to climb to 75% support for BU to actually be blocking it since BU only had about 20%. Segwit simply doesn't have network support. Today with BUs new hashing power support... Segwit would need to be at 55%ish support to have BU blocking it. Bitcoin was designed for 1 hash = 1 vote... and that is it... that is the consensus system. BU is playing by the fundamental rules of the system since the start. Segwit just hasn't achieved the required network support. 
Fortunately the BU devs and most of their supporters seem happy to have Segwit or a similar innovation applied to BU after the fork. So BU+Segwit+Lightning is their goal also. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:22:58
Why don't Core even support decentralized development and fight against it at every opportunity? It would only make Bitcoin stronger. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:54:11
Core should immediately move to include other teams in the development and stop this fighting. They should embrace decentralized multi team development for the health of the network and community. They should take a leadership role in doing this and come across as ultimate heroes.

They see this mess that has been created and go 'nope'... many are just going straight to the current number two crypto. From one platform with less utility... to another... social network history 10 years back had something similar happen. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:53:19
BU hasn't actually stalled anything yet. Segwit just hasn't received the support it needs. It has been stuck at 23%ish for four months. It would need to climb much higher, like to 60% to be blocked or stuck by BUs 40% hashpower. If it actually did climb higher maybe more miners would ditch BU, rather than cause an actual block. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:36:03
Yeah this, the is the exact opposite of what the OP is saying here. The guy is saying rBTC is being attacked by sockpuppets. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:42:02
Bitcoin wasn't designed with any way for users to have power if they aren't miners. Nodes is the most users can do and vast majority of users don't run nodes so it isn't a realistic or measurable way to attain consensus. The whole word consensus was based around mining hashpower... Nakamoto Consensus, the famous term is literally talking about miners voting. Voting was designed 1 hash=1 vote, mining, and the blockchain we all made for the purpose to attain consensus. There is no 'Reddit Users Upvote Algorithm" in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:34:31
Bam Cohen has done nothing but dump on Bitcoin since the beginning. I won't trust this guy no matter what side of the debate he is on. Great he made Bittorrent... awesome invention... but then he watched Bitcoin fly all the way up to 1240 and spent the whole time shitting on it, declaring it a useless failure causing people to lose money. Beyond his Bittorrent work... not exactly visionary. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:34:40
If Bitcoin Unlimited client receives majority support it is officially Bitcoin, not an altcoin, based on the fundamental design of Bitcoin since the start. This is how Satoshi Nakamoto designed it. It will be BTC... not BTU. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:19:14
Don't have much choice. 1 hash = 1 vote. That is how bitcoin works. The is the consensus system. I highly doubt BU will be anything bad for Bitcoin. It will be more like nothing has happened but free up space for transactions, stop the backlog, and make fees low the way Bitcoin was designed to be.
@_date: 2017-03-09 05:50:21
Charlie's boss Brian Armstrong is a long time supporter of decentralized development and larger blocks would likely override this. I imagine he would desire to follow the majority chain since that would be Bitcoin based on the rules that have existed since Satoshi's whitepaper. Calling a BU majority chain BTU is in direct contradiction to the fundamental design of Bitcoin. A majority chain BU would be the official Bitcoin whether we like it or not. 
We don't just get to change the rules because we don't like the result. Otherwise why are we even following any of the rules to begin with. The ETF will follow the majority chain too... so playing games like this would just cause more unneeded confusion. 
Just make a temporary name "old fork BTC" and "new fork BTC" until it is resolved and the final name of BTC is given to the majority chain.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:16:36
Because what is its really all about is ego and control. If it isn't exclusively theirs they'd rather burn the whole thing down than put Bitcoins needs first.
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:16:06
Bitcoin was built on the concept of 1 hash = 1 vote being the defining consensus making tool. That is what Nakamoto Consensus actually is. Nodes are good to show support but don't actually make changes to the network. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:30:36
It was at a steady 20% of the network for the last month and Antminer just started signaling... BU is about to have about 38% of the network. Facts. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:47:52
When the Core team was gradually upended from the instead out it didn't kill Bitcoin... despite all the originals superstar leader coders leaving, replaced with secondary or completely new ones. Though with time it did cause massive clogs to the system, high fees, and a toxic divided community. I feel it would be fantastic to unite the community once more and have all the great innovations. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:15:59
Got to love your 'I know you are but what am I?' poor excuse for an reply just mirroring my words. Gavin and Mike were both professional, upstanding, polite coders that wanted Bitcoin to proceed as it has always been proceeding. Jeff Garzik as well. Their work brought it from the $1 Satoshi era to $1200+ and being taken seriously by the world. Gavin stepped down from his leadership position to try and help remove a figure head single point of failure... but the vacuum was filled by poison. Greg Maxwell is a toxic mess who has a long history of damaging communities dating back to his terrorizing of Wikipedia a decade ago. Everything that has happened since Gavin stepped down has divided the community, damaged Bitcoin, and ruined confidence from many people because of terrible leadership and attempts to turn Bitcoin into something it has never been instead of continue what it actually is. You spend so much time in this insulated happy place of a forum that you aren't even aware of what reality is, let alone being able to declare an inversion of it.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:28:15
It is a great news, BU is in line with what Bitcoin was originally designed for. That original concept is what made it so successful in the first place. Segwit, Lighting, all those things will be awesome also and work wonderfully with BU as the majority client. The stalemate must end... it shouldn't have existed in the first place. Bitcoin is awesome and can have all these innovations together. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:14:42
Which is exactly why Core is about to lose. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:09:57
"So BU seem to think that the original Satoshi design was for Bitcoin to be a controlled, centralised dictatorship privately run by a tiny group of people who shower themselves with grand titles to fit their egos."
Well... that effectively could describe what Core has done too aside from the 'grand titles' part. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 02:43:08
Gavin was a great dev. The guy was appointed by Satoshi Nakamoto! The guy who is the cause for all of us being here! He has made some mistakes along the way, but no one is infallible. I'd love it if he was back in the fold, and all the various teams could work together to overcome these differences that have happened along the way. =)
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:19:45
I love BU, Segwit and Lightning. The stalemate must end and using all three would be fantastic. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:14:46
Miners already control the blocksize... at least the were able to until it reached the 1mb limit. BU wants to remove that cap and let things continue as they have been. I really wouldn't say the ruler is everyone. Users get no real say aside from nodes... and few users actually run nodes. The rulers are currently Core AND the Miners. Core has centralized development with a single group... and the miners have all the power to signal what they want. What we need is Core stepping up as a leader and adopting decentralized multiteam development. Having just Core, talented as they are, has allowed this situation to unfold. More teams, more brains, less group think, more success for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:59:15
No it actually isn't. Segwit does not have network support. It has about 23% of the support of the network currently. If that support increased into 70% range... only then would BU supporters be blocking Segwit. 1 hash = 1 vote. That is all that matters. That is how bitcoin was designed. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:55:46
You are correct there will be HF given prevailing attitudes like that. BU will become the majority chain and BU will be Bitcoin. Those are the rules of Bitcoin from the start. That is what consensus is... the network hashing consensus. This is part of what has made Bitcoin work from the start. And you are correct, that style of thinking is 'head the clouds' or head in the sand style thinking. It would appear BU majority chain is inevitable now... and most BU support having Segwit and Lightning go along with it... but had Core behaved differently this situation likely would not have happened.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:02:40
Unfortunately rbitcoin and rbtc do not represent the entire community. Segwit definitely does NOT have 60% of the support of anything. Exchanges saying they are ready for it doesn't mean much... they are exchanges... they will get ready for anything that comes down the pipeline. For the most important metric... hashing power... 1 hash = 1 vote that has always been the consensus voting tool... Segwit has stalled at 23ish% and been stuck there for four months. The blocksize has always increased, it just had a 1mb cab that has now been reached... BU allows this to be increased and decreased as needed. BU+Segwit+Lightning would be a killer Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:23:47
Core+EC would be great. Having multiple teams with decentralized development would be fantastic too. This entire issue/debate/war has shown a weakness in Bitcoin. Group think can cause polarization. If we have multiple clients and teams, no one team can be accused of being a 'dictator' and we can gain strength from all of their combined wisdom. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:13:53
That's right people! How about we just erase everything Satoshi Nakamoto made, no proof of work, no miners, no blockchain, nothing, just users and Core, that would certainly make something special! Why didn't Satoshi do that in the first place and just make Core coin? That certainly would have risen in value for absolutely no reason. /s
Come on! Proof of work IS Bitcoin.. Erik is correct! Core is full of talented people... but this is out of line... is would turn Core into an altcoin by their own logic they have repeated over and over. Lets not do this! 
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:49:57
Currently the 'power' effectively is split. Core has control over the protocal. They want certain changes and small blocks. Miners and many other users want larger blocks since it was the original plan and they don't want to alter from that. The large blockers generally want decentralized development also to prevent further problems like this from happening. So Core plus many other teams, BU, Classic, others, all providing their own groups brain power and preventing any single team from getting lost in group think becoming centralized. The fact that these two parties both have power in different ways has lead to this stalemate. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:57:36
The original whitepaper doesn't say anything about a community influence or voting algorithm. Bitcoin can't detect 'community support', reddit votes, or any other straw poll equivalent. In fact Bitcoin was designed to not have to deal with such immeasurable issues. We can't actually measure support for anything accurately online and Satoshi knew that... and thus 1 hash=1 vote became a thing.
Bitcoin was designed for 1 hash=1 vote and that hasn't changed yet. Core should make a new proposal for how to move forward and win this thing... not claim that bitcoin is something it isn't. This denial of the fundamental protocol level rules doesn't help anything. Segwit didn't gain the support, stalled at 24%, how about giving something else a shot and win over the entire community? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:43:54
This is simply the fact of the matter based on the rules of the Bitcoin system since day one. Longest chain, majority hashrate IS Bitcoin. Be it Core, BU, or some future client that attains the majority... call it Bitcoin Forever or something down the line. 
The rules for Bitcoin don't suddenly change when people aren't getting their way. BU may eventually have to deal with this also. Those are the rules. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:52:58
Segwit has never actually been blocked. It stalled at 24% months ago and remained their for four, coming on five months now. It was only recently as BU's hashrate increase did it even get close to 'blocking' Segwit. Still... Segwit would need 60% of the hashrate right now before it would actually be blocked by BU. Instead it simply never gained support. Segwit needs to gain actual support... maybe then BU support would drop. Or Core needs a different solution to bring the community together.
