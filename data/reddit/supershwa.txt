Everyone sells data.  *We are all leads.*
The focus here seems to be purely on Facebook, but the real issue is that everyone does it to some degree: *Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Visa, Mastercard, government records (state/federal), ISPs, Experian, Amazon, PornHub, games, search engines, phone companies, real estate agencies, grocery stores, the neighbor kid's web page*, etc etc.
The details may not be specific to "John Doe" in their individual databases, but instead as userid   Either way, cross-referencing all of this data allows you to create a detailed profile of userid  (you), and even determine that it is in fact, John Doe at IP address 101.101.0.1 who lives at 123 High St., is single, has roughly $40k/y income, rents for $500/mo, follows Elon Musk, watches 80 hours of porn per week and just spent $2000 on a new TV...so let's show him an ad for the new "Hot Chicks From Mars in 4k" game!  The next website will show you an ad for Rice-A-Roni just because your parents used a coupon in 1980.  This data, just like deepfakes and Pepe memes, *will be here forever*.
The paradox of the internet.  The frontier of **all** types of information meaning **anyone** can (and will) abuse or respect it.
But now I wonder: why do we give such a plop about our "privacy" in the first place?  Why are we so secretive we're afraid 7+ billion people will give a shit versus the few in our lives?  Is it so bad to get an ad for the Dollar Shave Club instead of that damn Nigerian prince who won't pay up?!
TL;DR - We're just numbers anyway and have been for a loooong time.  So what?

In a nutshell:
July 2018, Thailand SEC announced its citizens would be allowed to invest in ICOs using the currencies: Baht, BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC, LTC, XRP and XLM.
Thursday, they removed BCH, ETC and LTC from that list.

You posted the exact amount you bought, so one could sort through recent blockchain transactions and figure out your wallet address.  While this might not be a big deal to you personally, it's common practice to maintain anonymity in crypto.

I didn't.  I'm sure it's ridiculous - these things normally have a 10%+ fee just for converting change to paper fiat.  But, the slowly growing use of Bitcoin as a real currency is exciting, nonetheless!

We have a few Bitcoin ATMs in Denver, and I've used them.  
They are KYC, so you have to scan an ID and/or verify your phone number.
The machine will give you a QR code/address to send your BTC to, and it will spit out a "claim receipt" for you to use when the transaction is verified.  I walked away for about 5-10 minutes and got a text message confirming the transaction, went back to the ATM, scanned the claim receipt, and the machine spat out my cash.
The fees are high, but if you're looking for a quick turnaround, it's pretty convenient.
Try  to search for BTC ATMs in your area.

Algebra.  Understanding simple formulas is more important than knowing personal variables.
For example, to calculate a DCA strategy: your monthly income is M and your monthly expenses is X, then
M - X = I
So, I is your net income after expenses.  The rule of thumb in crypto is to invest only 10% of your net income, so
I x 0.1 = C
C is the max amount to invest each month.  Now, to determine an estimate for gains after a year (12 months) of investing, we'd use
(C x 12) x P = T
Where P is a hypothetical percentage (let's say you hope/expect to make 20% in gains) so
(C x 12) x 1.2 = T
Now, T represents your total investment with gains, so to determine exactly how much you made off the money you invested
T - (C x 12) = G
G is your gains.
The fun part about this is that you can use these formulas with any salary and any currency, and, to prove they work you don't need to know how much I earn from my job or how much I expect to earn in gains.  You can simply fill in the variables with your own numbers.
There are many ways to calculate wealth, earnings, gains, losses, etc. but I just wanted to show how easy it is to use Algebra to explain the math without revealing personal information.

Nope, Colorado.  When the news about Coinstar supporting Bitcoin came out a little while back, I was checking around town and couldn't find a machine that had the update.

I get the point, but people need to understand that finances, whether Bitcoin or fiat, should never be revealed in public.  You shouldn't tell people how much is in your savings account, assets or investment portfolio, either.  This is information only you, your spouse/partner, lawyers, accountants and the tax man should know.
Some people turn entitled and envious when they hear about others' money.  Example: if you win the lottery, then tell everyone about it, there *will* be certain friends and family members beating down your door asking for "loans".
Be smart about your money and *protect* it.

Good question.  I'm not sure - I'll make a point of feeding it a few bucks this week just to experiment and will report back with details!

Agreed - it's more efficient to take your change to the bank and just use it to DCA your Bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2019-11-08 03:43:33
Bitcoin won't replace anything.  It's setting a new standard, yes, but it won't replace the USD.  The USD will certainly turn into a centralized digital currency, but Bitcoin is the trailblazer that will likely continue to hold the highest value.

Dude, relax.  People who use trading platforms are not after long term store of value.  They're trading for short term gains.

What is Spot Price
The spot price is the current price in the marketplace at which a given asset—such as a security, commodity, or currency—can be bought or sold for immediate delivery. While spot prices are specific to both time and place, in a global economy the spot price of most securities or commodities tends to be fairly uniform worldwide when accounting for exchange rates. In contrast to the spot price, a futures price is an agreed upon price for future delivery of the asset. 
@_date: 2019-10-14 02:32:58
Nope, $6500 soon.  Price usually cranks up within a few months *after* halvings.  I know, history doesn't repeat itself, but it sure echoes...

Can't cancel if they processed with the bank, but check your wallet confirmations.  If they went through, just wait a day or so to sell.  The market is 24/7, so there's bound to be a high point you can sell at unless you were buying at price peaks (which is a very bad idea IMO).

Good time to buy and hold for a day or two...not sure why all the complaints.  Buy in a bearish market, sell in a bullish.  The best time to sell was when it hit $11k, then buy again at $9k.  This stuff happens every time exchanges go down -- it's a great opportunity!  $1000-$2000 of profit in a day if you have $9k in capital...really, it's a good time for daytraders, and has nothing to do with a "bubble"!
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:27:24
Was looking for this.  I could easily see banks using Bitcoin (or similar) to transition into cryptocurrency in order to stay afloat.  They will, of course, charge a fee for it in order to profit.  Those who don't understand how the wallet system works will prefer to rely on their banks - the problem in the US will be FDIC insurance, but that could change, too.
It's complete speculation, but very possible it could happen.  We'll have to wait and see how (and *if*) it works in Germany, first.

This.  Watch out for that "Bart Pattern".  Rallies like this are often followed by a 50%+ crash due to the popularity of shorting.  We cleared the resistance level it's been fighting for months so I'm keeping my eyes open for a bounce around $4440.

Bitcoin can mostly be *traded* for money right now, and the price fluctuates **rapidly**.  Some vendors accept Bitcoin *as* currency, usually based on the daily pair value of the local fiat, but not enough of them do.
If in the U.S. and buying for store-of-value, use Coinbase and/or Coinbase Wallet - there are small fees, but it's the easiest for a newbie.
Over time, the value will go up (according to the concept and analyses) so "HODL"ing is recommended, but not required.
Do your research.  This is still a new tech, and has people shaking in their boots - don't sacrifice everything you own on it, but if the outcome is positive, you'll be happy you jumped in.

No way it'll be $100k by the end of 2018.  On a logarithmic chart based on previous years' prices we're looking at anywhere between $9k and $40k.  Maybe $100k in 2019.  Keep in mind after it hits peak prices it is usually overvalued and enters a correction phase, with the price dropping dramatically for a while.  Over time, it just keeps going up, so as long as you can be patient, you'll always have another opportunity to catch it at the tip of a bull run.

Flash crashes created some awesome opportunities in '17.  If that's what this is (and I'm very skeptical), then it could be a strong bullish sign for coming months.
As far as the TV networks go, I think when it comes to Bitcoin, the older they are, the less they understand.  Their understanding of crypto is based purely on the stock market, which is like comparing Pac Man to Skyrim.  Both have their qualities: one is a stable, timeless classic with basic, established rules but the latter is superior in quality and complexity, with a few bugs, glitches and cheaters, unfortunately.
