Well, Coke used to cost a penny, now it costs at least a dollar.  100x inflation after several decades, it's close to bitcoin.

Isn't price drop good for mining? Less people mine causes a drop in difficulty.

I have serious question about this lightning network thing, how come everyone have to implement their own version?  Shouldn't it just a library and an api?

What other exchanges that are able to accept usd?  I am wonder why coinbase can find a bank that works with them but other exchanges cannot.

China is going to discourage bitcoin mining.  Chinese miners will either sell their rigs or move oversea.  The politics of bitcoin will be different after this.

He got balls. He could potentially lose all his bitcoins.

In theory, you can leverage infinitely.  You can take out a loan and use the money to buy bitcoin, then take out more loan and do it over and over again. 
I wonder what happen if there is a flash crash to like 10 cents, it happened before in eth. Does it dump your bitcoin immediately?

Didn't jeff garzik just fork United bitcoin several weeks ago?!!  Now another fork?  In United bitcoin, he also took away the bitcoin of the original inventor of bitcoin and distributed it. 
In last fork, i think hardly anyone was able to take advantage of the last fork because there was some funky requirement like the user was required to send bitcoin to his own address to prove being active.  Does this new fork have similar requirement?

If bitcoin goes to 0, it's 4 billions of 0s.

Hundred thousand bitcoin is alot for a single seller if you think of it as a percentage. Imagine same thing happens to dollar or stock.  
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:04:48
The problem is that there is no real value. Just like gold and diamond, they have value because people say they do. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:29:45
Nothing to worry about, just print more dollars to pay the debt. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:18:23
Well, you can still sell yourself.

I don't understand why he dumped in the exchange instead of auction or dark pool. This guy knows nothing about trading, he must be just an admistrator. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:37:38
But can you imagine when there are multiple applications that utilize blockchain in your pc?  Now they even talk about storing documents in blockchain. Why would people buy huge hd just to use these applications?
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:42:00
This guy needs to setup an auction, don't be cheap with investors' money.

Japan is a first world country, but it has as many idiots as any other countries, he looks like one of them literally in the photo.

Hey, bitcoin is crashing again, your lost is actually decreasing.  
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:13:20
Old news?

Good, they should move to China. They need more girls. Guys in china are responsible for owning a house before marrying, his daughters win. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:08:37
People said no. Yes or no?
@_date: 2018-02-27 03:29:24
Email can easily be faked, it's just text. Why not just ask him to provide the private key for the billions worth of bitcoin?  That's the only acceptable proof. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 03:35:07
Why didn't they just pro rate return the bitcoins to the investor? Investors will get alot more. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:41:20
This world is so fake.  Speech has ghost writer, now app has ghost developers. Win win for them.  The girl gets to be famous, the developer gets to make money from the app. And the world just becomes more fake. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:37:04
Why desktop? You should have done mobile. It's like people still asking why bitcointalk is still only a desktop website.

There will be tons of used cards in eBay after this crash. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:29:37
Well, this crash partially solves the problem. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:29:36
They act like Goldman Sachs is a real person.  Many people in the company have different opinions. They can make money with bitcoin even if it goes to zero.

Call them to waive them, never heard of a bank that does this. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:58:24
Yeah, there is nothing constructive about this subreddit. No serious discussion. I am unsubscribing. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:47:31
Now people went from extremely optimistic to extremely bearish.  Time for reversal?

This title is confusing as hell. I read multiple times and still don't understand.

Well, stocks don't rise 30x in a month.  Crypto does.

Did Roger sell his bitcoin for bcash? Why did he care about bitcoin cash so much?
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:58:49
The pizza guy thought that he's getting rich because bitcoin yard to worth $20k, then he realized that he's only getting fraction of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:39:22
What? They charged the fees of all those transactions that you did in the past in one day?
