I believe just sending the coins outside of coinbase is still considered a taxable event.

Seriously. I never took any geography class and I went to public school in California.

I would imagine this applies to massive debt that the person feels is unescapable. Not being rich by losing a lottery ticket is less likely.
Sorry for your loss though.

Place stops at your baseline profit levels and your odds of losing your shirt goes down tremendously.

Any ideas on the monthly bandwidth required? I'm capped at a certain monthly amount

Basically, nobody wants to be the first asshole to buy bitcoin at 10k but eventually someone does and we move on
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:52:21
I still can't fully wrap my head around this. Exchange withdrawal limits (at least with GDAX) seems like it would slow this at least.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:05:47
How do you efficiently get the funds back to the original exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:19:02
Surely Bitcoin profits had to outweight the debt compounding, no?

Even with age based mutual funds the "risk profile" is set to high when they're young so it is aggressive and gains value. It then switches to be less and less risky as they approach college age. Bitcoin is risky but also giving back 100%+ gains. The best you'll find in mutual funds is 5-8% or so. 
It's a wise move if you ask me. This train still has some rails in front of it. Nervous about a huge drop? Set stops and move them up as things progress.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:24:47
Next stop is 15k for sure
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:22:00
There’s plenty of people still waiting for 3,4,5,6k to come back and it never did (yet)

My wife is currently at this crossroads. She could pay off her student loans by completely cashing out of crypto but the future gains are enticing her. I’m not really sure what way to advise her to go. 
Edit: thank you everyone for the ideas and strategies. I’ll go over these options with her. Basically everyone said to at least pay off half but she got a chunk of money in the last year and already paid off half her student loans and put the other half into crypto (on my brilliant suggestion). So I feel like she’s already done the “right thing” and knocked it down a lot. We targeted the higher interest rate loan first.

* Withdraw daily limit from ATM
* Stamp all currency
* Deposit all currency into ATM

I missed it by literally seconds and my buy was never filled until 3750.
@_date: 2017-08-31 01:49:27
I've thought this at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and now 2500.
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:27:27
Wouldn’t that be a taxable event? All of your spending would be considered capital gains. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:35:52
Depends on the way the price is going but most here would hope for up which would then be capital gains.
@_date: 2019-10-06 14:58:30
Nothing bad will ever happen to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:32:19
And if it doesn’t? What’s plan B?
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:05:25
It is a little shady, I agree
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:22:23
10777, this is wild
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:11:34
I thought the price was going up due to people jumping in to get both coins, then would dump after the split. I figured the canceled split would cause people to leave early due to no extra coin but maybe not?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:25:00
Thinking $5500 or so but will keep a close eye as it approaches 6K
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:37:47
The difference is chump change in the long run
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:33:33
Besides, Tesla could easily reach out on a business to business basis and Coinbase would have to be idiots not to fast track their account.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:23:32
I was too since it broke 8k. Bought back in a few hours ago because I was tired of waiting.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:46:17
Most people use Coinbase as it is the easiest and most convenient. That comes at a price.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:23:03
True, but at this rate you'd recover them and be in the green in a matter of days.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:25:58
I wish I would have went all in at $250 and then entered a coma or something so I couldn't have sold.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:48:53
I would and am waiting for a correction
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:20:48
Thanks, so it’s “Informe tecnico gringo”
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:17:06
Ah right next to “Rusty Trombone”
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:43:13
I’ve been trying to hardest my to follow the battle but get confused at times so forgive the question, but what’s the next attack or hurdle we can expect from BCash? The drama isn’t over yet, right?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:27:02
Recession FUD though means getting your cash out of the market to use it/store it. The average person wouldn’t be reinvesting it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:32:52
I went to buy $1000 worth of BTC just now and the coinbase fee was $14.68. Really did your dad a solid there! Lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:22:00
Such a random spike. I had been waiting in fiat for a few days and finally tonight said screw it, a dip isn't coming. So glad I did!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:24:51
It really depends on the speed of the crash. A regular retracement your spread should be fine. It's the true FUD news like a hack or goverment regulation/shut down and makes it dive so fast the stops won't trigger.

Family is on vacation in Hawaii, just took some profits just under 6k and will now fly home worry free when it comes time to pay the credit card :D
@_date: 2018-07-09 02:27:55
You can use it on any vending machine, you would just get about 6499 Sacajawea coins in return
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:09:57
On the main Coinbase site if you check the price on the dashboard and then hit “buy” it’s always more expensive on the buy page.

[My exit plan](
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:18:11
Could be 40-50% though which does make a difference
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:30:25
I forgot about the reddit sign up form that comes with every bitcoin purchase
@_date: 2017-06-28 07:37:34
On the bright side, at least they prevented OP from buying at the peak of the bubble
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:00:02


Can you elaborate on this? What do you mean?
