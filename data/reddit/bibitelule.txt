after several issues with coinbase i'll get ride off this shit. Everytimes it's needed to be fast it's taking hours to withdraw but to put cash in it's taking few minutes... I sent this message to the support let's see what they will reply What wrong with you ? Ok there is ethereum network congestion , but why this long with not even 1 confirmed ?why from a wallet only taking 10 mn to transfert fund in coinbase, but whithdraw taking ages? why we can't track the transaction ? why nothing is clear? Why all the time it's needed to be fast it's not possible at coinbase? it's this way you making money ? i'll post on every forum i'm able to post , every fucking forum talking about coinbase for me it's too much . I had to many issues with coinbase. For sure i'll move to another exanche website but be sure i'll make the worst pub i can everywhere i'm able to post. That's too much
