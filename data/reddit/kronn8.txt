But isnt the total amount of currency in circulation supposed to reflect the value of the economy? (I have a very limited economics background).
Lets assume each product has an energy investment in it, between the cost of the educations of the people who designed it, th cost of extracting the matter used to make it, the cost of manufacture, etc... if there are 100GJ worth of products in the economy in a given tear, and the follow year another 10GJ is harvested and turned into products, shouldn't the amount of currency need to increase by 10% in order to hold constant the average price of a product? Therefore, since the supply of diamonds increases slower than the supply of cell phones, the added cellphones would deflate their value and make them cheaper, while diamonds should increase in price since their supply is a decreasing percentage of the economy. Meanwhile, some third product, like corn, maintains the same price in that period because its supply increases at the average rate of 10% in a year. 
Sry for typos, I did this on my phone

This is a pretty interesting idea. Could you elaborate? Im assuming that for a macroscopic system like this, the velocity of money would instead be represented as the 'temperature' of the economy or regions of the economy.
Entropy is also a very interesting concept here. Keep in mind that At maximum entropy, money would be as spread out as possible and would have a very high temperature. On the other hand, low monetary entropy would mean that the temperature of the economy is very low and/or money is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals.
Could somebody with a better background in economics interpret what these two situations would mean for an economy?
