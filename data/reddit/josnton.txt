Complaining about manipulation in a free market is kinda pointless though? 
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:48:24
Not even close, they said they're working on the technical issues, but its been 2 weeks now and nothing has changed. They're now simply buying time while the value of their bitcoins plummet. 
Not an expert, but i'd say Coinbase is safe. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:30:19
I'm not sure where you're looking, but it's definitely not all good news. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:08:50


So you're telling me there's a chance. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:06:38
Didn't people post this at $600? 
Looks like catching a falling knife just leads to more blood. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:34:07
News: newly received or noteworthy information, especially about recent events.
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:29:05
It's a free market, you can't do anything about it.

Stories like this is the reason mtgox going down is not 'good news'. 
Confidence has been shattered and people have lost truth and faith. Hope everyone affected is financially ok, would hate to hear stories of people going into debt due to mtgox's error.

Inquire doesn't mean create a conspiracy and try to find facts to support it. 
It means gather the facts and then see where it leads. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:23:46
Yes, it may have been financially irresponsible, but it doesn't change the fact that the fault lies almost completely with mtgox. 
Not every investor is a reddit user and may not have been aware of the stories surrounding the company. In some markets gox was the only way to invest in bitcoins in that currency. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:13:01
Do they need to somehow throw race or gender into every news topic they come across? So dumb. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:59:17
Normal business losses shouldn't be seen as the same thing to 'lost' like keys down the back of a sofa.

Post of the day. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:18:27


The smugness from this post is in the stratosphere. Bitcoin isn't rising because it's far too intelligent for those simple minded plebs! We're so much better than them. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:59:36


So basically, he's thinking not Bitcoin but an alternative. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:40:37
Pro-Bitcoin news: Price rises, they benefit. 
Anti-Bitcoin news: Price drops, they lose out on money. 
Can see them making the decision to try and dismiss small stories that could impact the price downwards.

I'd personally hold off until the Gox situation has been worked out. 
If you're looking for long-term holding, you may as well get in now. But don't go anywhere near Gox. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:25:19
This is one of those cases where bad publicity =/= good publicity. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:36:13
Get them a proper gift. 
Only buy people bitcoin as a gift if they are actually aware of what it is and would be grateful. Don't use their wedding as an excuse to promote bitcoin, seems a bit tactless. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:10:41
We must have different definitions of the word 'proof'. 
Seems that with most things, blame the US government seems the in thing. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:48:40
Is there any way to find out who the thief might be? 
Unless they're incredibly stupid and brag/sell all of it at once, it'll be hard to catch them. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:06:42
The full amount? Pretty much 0%. 
You might get a part, but still very low odds of that. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:46:55
Is there a 'worst run company' award? Mtgox has it sewn up for 2014 already.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:13:31
I would like to think the overall failing of the business is down to incompetence and not criminal activity. Would be tough to get away with shutting down a huge business and disappearing. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:42:46
Mtgox dragging out their death is actually good news! 
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:50:10
Work in percentages, small change in the grand scheme of the currency. Not the case for mtgox and Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:19:40
'There's nothing to discuss' 
Hmm, gonna have to disagree with you there considering this is a massive hit to Bitcoin holders and consumer confidence in the currency. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:59:02
Reminds me of ManBearPig. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:45:36
You don't think Mtgox giving up and filing for bankruptcy isn't noteworthy? 
Even if it was obvious, the confirmation is big news anyway. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:02:55
Best opportunity to buy since last week! Though according to some it's been a great opportunity to buy since $750. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:53:42
Have we heard any actual details about the thievery? 
Is one guy just sitting on £500m right now? Though if they've stolen Goxcoins aren't they all worthless now anyway? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:29:18
Them filing for bankruptcy is pretty big news, sorry. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 11:58:35
People actually believe this garbage.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:22:35
Please don't put any more money in mtGox. If they haven't managed to stay solvent with the volumes they've been trading over the past few years they aren't going to now. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:03:53
Also, lost in this case is a simple normal business loss. 
Mtgox have actually just lost a load of money. It's like a bank being robbed of trillions or accidentally burning it, unheard of. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:51:47
Had they been more open when things fell apart it still wouldn't have given people their money back. 
Sure they're being dicks right now with their shadiness, but it doesn't change anything other than bad will towards that company. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:51:40
They aren't going to pick bitcoin as a currency, lets be serious.
