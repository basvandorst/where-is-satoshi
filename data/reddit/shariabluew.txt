and just wait until they start asking to take btc payments or btc funds from their husbands as alimony (allhismoney) or settlement in a divorce

Look into gamergate, the nfl, sports channels, spike tv, science industry, comic books, movies, corporate office politics, affirmative action, europe's migrant crisis, etc.
Keep burying your head in the sand, it won't change anything.

marketing towards men is mostly a waste of time, everyone knows to market to women
however it doesn't apply across all industries, forced introduction of women has genuinely been to the detriment of several male dominated industries. (ie. engineering, videogames, comic books, movies, sports, etc.)
what i mean to say is gender politics should not even need to be a factor but unfortunately it all too often is and it's to the detriment of the industry.
This push into male space is rarely due to a true desire to belong to a traditionally all-male institution or condition, but women are encouraged to believe they’ll make some dent in the universe simply by being the first to push past a “gender barrier.” It’s not about making a true contribution to that male institution or endeavor, but rather a goal of being ‘the first woman to do it too’.

look at any male dominated space and tell me how the forced introduction of women into the space helped (videogames, sports, etc.)
im not against women entering the space at all, just against doing it for the sake of doing it without any other reason than “muh equality”

He is warning normie investors from putting in too much money and getting scammed.
If you don't know what you're doing it's really easy to lose a lot of money very quickly.
I had a friend of mine over the weekend tell me after he sold his motorcycle he put the money into coinbase and bought 1 BTC.
That represents $10,000 USD at the time he bought in.  I had to explain to him what a wallet is and that he is an idiot for keeping that much money in an exchange.
Needless to say I walked him through the steps and setup a nano ledger wallet for him over the weekend and showed him the transfer of BTC to his wallet.
He was happy and ended up giving me 0.01 BTCs out of it for helping him.
I would warn any newcomers to setup your wallet and crypto infrastructure first and practice with small amounts before moving any amount of serious money in.

This is a big impediment because people don't understand you can buy fractions of crypto coins

better have your btcs on a hardware wallet in cold storage, at any moment these exchanges could get hacked or crash and poof your money is gone in an instant.

banks are a mess, after using btc a couple times for transactions and wires, i dont ever intend on going back, it's a complete joke in comparison and rip-off

anytime someone in the past said we would be lacking the power capacity required for new tech they turned out to be wrong and grossly underestimated the growth rate of computer hardware capabilities and software optimization

Bch is a scam, rogers just picking up btcs and dumping bch on people. At least you made profit off your btc though, a very good return.

Push to be acknowledged by what you are contributing to the community not because of your gender, whenever the gender card is played it's a pathetically obvious power play
