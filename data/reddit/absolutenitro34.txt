Thanks for that
But that will push through the transaction to my new wallet address which seems to be BCH only on the electron cash app
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:30:43
The BCH all transferred, does this mean I can expect some indication that my BTC also transferred, within the electron cash wallet?

Sure- for the sake of my simplistic understanding of BTC i'll use the same nomenclature I've been using, but your point is well taken
The first transaction (from the address of my original multibit wallet to the address identical to me electroncash wallet) does not even appear on blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info. When I click the links to that transaction in multibit it goes to an error page (transaction not found)
The second transaction (the one from my multibit to electrum addresses, for the same coins) has a fee of 516.175 sat/B

If it is stuck in limbo, how do I get the BTC out of limbo? In multibit classic, when the BTC transactions are shown, my old transactions are all confirmed but this latest one does have a marker that says "not yet confirmed". Can I reverse or push it through somehow?
When i go to blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info it also says the transaction is not found

Thanks for your help! I will wait for the BTC confirmation and hope it goes to an address that I can access

If that did happen, should I be able to see the transaction in which my btc were stolen on a blockchain site like blockchain.info ? There is no way for a "hidden" transaction to occur, correct?

Well for the electroncash wallet, when I swept the multibit keys, the BCH immediately entered that wallet and was confirmed instantly. Then the multibit wallet shows an unconfirmed transaction for my full amount of bitcoins to a wallet with an address identical to the BCH wallet
I then downloaded electrum and swept the same keys again and in my electrum wallet it shows an unconfirmed pending deposit for the full amount of BTC. That transaction is also showing up in multibit, also as unconfirmed.

well, as I understand it they are two seperate wallets- electroncash is for BCH and electrum is for BTC. I got this info from this forum:

i downloaded it from 
so should i export keys from the electron cash wallet and then import them into electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:41:31
OK, I did that- so now I should just wait? 
My one fear, which alludes back to my first post. What if the bitcoins go to the wallet (or to the keys) associated with the electroncash wallet? will they be retrievable? That transaction isnt appearing on the blockchain websites so I'm hoping the one associated with electrum gets verified and that one goes away... should I be worried?

I downloaded electrum and ran it. Created a new wallet and used the "Sweep" function again to transfer the coins over into that wallet. It appears to have worked and I "broadcast" it- now the new electrum wallet has 0 BTC in it but an uncomfirmed amount of BTC equal to my original total.
It appears the BTC are in limbo between three wallets- my original multibit wallet. A wallet with the same address as my electroncash wallet, and my electrum wallet. How do i navigate this, or steer the BTC to go to my electrum wallet? Thanks for your input
