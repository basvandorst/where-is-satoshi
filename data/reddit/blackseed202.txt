This is true.  I spent almost 4-5 hours yesterday reading articles and trying to sell 0.1 worth of btc for profit.  
Crazy. Thats what money or btc can do.

Lets say i buy/sell from localbitcoins. And its private to private right. How do they know its for trading btc if i dont put any reference about bitcoin? 
How do they differentiate that from normal money from friends or families. Or can i just declare thats a gift from friends etc. 
Or maybe if i have banks at different countries with less regulation,  how do they even track that

Is it better to buy from exchanges or p2p websites? Rate wise and security?

How much btc revenue should i consider registering as a business? Or is it okay to just buy and sell?
@_date: 2016-12-12 22:29:32
Lol ok. Tax wise?

So basically buy online and sell by cash?

Right. So when i pay by my card there was no foreign currency fee. So im not sure if the rate provided by the card is better than the circle/base conversion rate?

Quick question. How do you calculate the fees associated etc lets say i want to transfer money to China, like £200, i mainly used revolut card to pay for items but lets say through btc, how much do you save?
Im very new to btc and just lurking around.
