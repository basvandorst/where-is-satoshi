I occasionally ask myself - after 50 years I will reach my pension age. Is the current pension system still going to work after 50 years from now? I highly doubt that outcome.   
At the end of the day it all depends on how our governments will resolve this work in the future.

Not your keys - Not your Bitcoin!  
Remember the good old saying - If all people knew how banks operate and use their money, they would cash out immediately. Unfortunately, not a lot of people know this.
