I have been away for awhile, when did this Reddit turn into a staunchly anti Bitcoin site?
@_date: 2019-11-01 18:52:29
I agree. I first discovered BTC in 2014. I found it incredibly interesting. For me approaching retirement, I will hold forever or until I feel I have enough to comfortably stop working. And I'm not including social security. I'm sure this is gonna happen within the next two years. Still, I hodl for BTC not myself. I'd love to leave behind a world better after I left. The when I got here. And there's not many in my generation that can say that.
@_date: 2019-11-13 23:23:20
Holders. Say, 10 year holders.
When I want to retire. That sounds like I'm asking for a price prediction. What I mean is. China has what 1.7 billion people. What affect could it have world wide. I know it will be closed source. I don't think there's any question there. Will it be a healthy affect or more of a negative affect or none really at all?

I think if trump hates bitcoin enough and really starts to badmouth it enough, Bezos might start using it. If for no other reason then to piss him off.

5000 years and $2,000 is the best we can get? SMH
@_date: 2018-10-29 15:16:20
Maybe I should stop hodl and get out as fast as I can. 
@_date: 2019-11-13 06:22:29
I'll bet they both holding btc.
@_date: 2018-10-31 16:56:09
Who? What? A house?
@_date: 2019-11-14 17:40:42
Any one of us that bought BTC around 2017 or less and are still hodling. Are basically doing the same thing. We could have cashed out at ATH's but we didn't. We holder on and still hodling.

Another year is what it will take for the public to put trust in bitcoin again. I got in early, but many of the people I talked into buying “in”didn’t do so well. And don’t forget about the 1000’s or millions that foolishly bought in December 17. Just imagine how many wives that talked their husbands into investing some or all of their life savings into crypto. It will take awhile for both of them to trust bitcoin again. Although I really don’t like the idea of an ETF.  It may speed the trust for bitcoin again.

I loved reading it. It’s pure tongue in cheek I’m sure. But it amuses on an otherwise dismal day. Lighten up guys.

I bought at $200. Made Lots of money and smart guys look at me like I lost because it dropped from its alt. Honest. I haven’t made a million dollars, but they look at me like I’m an idiot for buying at the price I did. That’s how much they don’t understand. Not all of them tho. Some give my a negative shake of their heads, but I can tell they’re pissed because I made money and they didn’t. Then you have a small amount of people that start asking questions and want to learn about something they don’t understand.
@_date: 2019-08-26 01:40:34
Ahhhh ok. Yes I got it from the Bitcoin Cash fork. Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2019-02-02 14:57:00
I hope your not trying to promote Bitcoin with that!
@_date: 2019-12-26 05:12:08
Ok thank you.

Capitalism run amuck is just as bad as socialism run amuck. There’s plenty of flex in both systems. Just like anything in life everyone has to bend a little to get along. The USA has been a little socialistic ever since Social Security was passed. Although capitalistic purists still hate it, it has kept many alive who’s only crime was being to old to work. America is primarily a capitalist country with some common sense socialism in place to help its citizens that need help.

Carbon copy of the letter they sent to me. Fuckers!!  I didn't loose much and I was a noob. And it was kinda fun, being new to it and all that. But that letter made .e feel like I fell for a scam. Which is something I pride myself in not falling for. Since I've just bought and held. I've also found myself being a believer. When I first bought BTC I never would have guessed that. If it can make a believer out of me. Maybe there really something good in this.
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:52:46
Wtf. An IRS agent with a Gun? What they’re gonna Gun me down for not paying a small amount of taxes on crypto? So they can do what? Throw it into a hole called the USS ford? A ship that’s keel was laid 14 years ago and still doesn’t function properly. They think the next war is gonna be fought on the high seas. Haha why on earth should I give a government money that can’t even figure out how and where the next war will be fought. Which most of my taxes go anyway. 
Welfare??? Haha that’s a joke. Welfare is less then 1% of my taxes. Unless of course you’re talking corporate welfare.

I had no luck with the ledger. Face recognition wouldn't work for more then a week and it would almost never synchronize with my account. And it has my Bitcoin Cash locked up and will not let me have access to it. Support is the worst I have ever encountered.
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:58:58
Fuckin asshole! Seems there's more con-men then honest to good people theses days. HTF did that happen?
 Tell me again why we want Wall St. in crypto?

Hands down the BTC !

Don't bother looking here for Bitcoin censorship content. It's not here.
@_date: 2019-12-05 13:55:27
That's true. But it has still save a lot of old people from dying in the streets like dogs. But hey! Let's give it to Wall St. Those wise souls would put it to work, Lord knows they need more yachts. Hippity hurrah!
@_date: 2019-12-25 05:29:37
I don't see it.

Was watching Fox and friends make fun of bitcoin I figured if those idiots thought it was nothing,it had to be something.
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:45:11
Why does it seem like Reddit is so full of BTC haters? Please leave!
@_date: 2018-11-10 04:44:14
I heard about it at $200. I just happened to watch Fox and Friends one morning. When I saw those three idiots laughing at Bitcoin. I figured if those morons thought it was a joke, it had to be something serious. 
@_date: 2019-09-08 18:22:32
Great way to spread the word. I'm sure some of the recipients of those have no idea what they are. Next year when word gets back to them that BTC is worth one $ million. They will be ripping their house apart trying to find them. Wink wink

I’ve bought things with Bitcoin that had a escrow.

Many ads are played for weeks after the actual game. For free on many television shows. The better the ad the longer its replayed.

You order a product from a market. Your funds are put in escrow until you receive said product after you get what you ordered you release your bitcoin from escrow and the vendor gets his money. If you’re not happy with your order don’t release your funds. Then a third party will look at the transaction and see why you’re not happy or the vendor is being dishonest.
@_date: 2019-09-18 18:34:06
I never bought them.

Go on the TOR Browser buy a fake passport with your name on it. Some of them are very good representations of the real thing.  I'm not sure how you could change your age once you turn 18 though. ��. Just kidding.

Bitcoin backed by guns!!! Hummmm something to think about. IRS could get army uniforms, say in a nice brownshirt style. 
With stylish armbands!!!

The Ledger is very finicky. One day it won't synchroniz the next day face recognition won't work. Just little things like that. It's kind of frustrating. And support is all but not there at all. Getting them to pair with your phone is almost impossible.
@_date: 2019-09-18 18:32:17
Then you just make the transaction.
