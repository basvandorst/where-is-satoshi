Why would you want to change the name to something (bits) that is already defined as the basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. Traditional bits can have one of two values, these "new" "bits" would not. just more confusing IMHO.
While I have no real say, satoshi's seem perfectly fine.

I would suggest it's a combination of people who just want tips, others who really are new and people who post and surprised they got a tip for their comment. I think that transactions (tips) in the blockchain increasing is of value to bitcoin over all.

with your analogy the funds were taken and the wallet was left on the ground. honorable ? not really.
also no update. I would like to see OP return the coin but that probably will not happen.

OP says he "swept" the wallet. seemingly leaving the wallet and taking the funds. But all is well now that OP has returned the funds. oh wait , he hasn't. you are right , this makes very little sense.

I found this link 
From the thread 
"Netflix partners with many different other brands to offer limited time promotions where netflix memberships are bundled with products like LG Smart TV's or Google Chromecasts. The people I get the codes from either get the codes from the people who buy the products and already have netflix/don't want it; or they buy the products, get the code, and sell the product on ebay or wherever."
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:09:51
Agreed. I actually find m/uBTC to be more confusing.

Same goes for influential people who say anything but nice things about Bitcoin. For a while it was Paul Krugman and now it's time to beat up on Warren Buffett. Basically FU if you are not 100% pro-bitcoin. No dissenters allowed.

I am quite familiar that 2 bits = quarter in the US. shave and a haircut. and that 1 bit was originally from the spanish coin , "pieces of eight". Bit is also short for binary digits.
I also don't care about the "average joe", whoever the hell that is....most IT professionals don't use the word bits very often either (bytes yes, bits not so much)
I still vote (meaningless vote) for satoshi's as the base unit. Also the abacus likely older than the term bits for money.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:14:58
bit of loaded question. "use MtGox again". if you have a balance on MtGox that is probably the only way to get anything back.
if you have no balance on Gox you would be IMHO an idiot to use MtGox again or ever.

hmm, interesting. I do have a smartphone, but I do not use it for 2FA. I use a 2nd phone that is txt/voice only for 2FA.
 I have the Coinbase app on my smartphone but I may remove it since it enables the API's@ Coinbase. The mobility and access of a smartphone is one thing that can help make Bitcoin ubiquitous but seems to be an achilles heel at the same time. 
I am looking at Android wallets now so maybe that will change my mind on smartphones and Bitcoin. There is a place around the corner where I can buy bakery items with Bitcoin so I have motivation!

rancher comes home to find his land burned, cows dead and his   wife raped. He hunts for years till he finds the person responsible. He then asks "are you the man that burned my land, killed my cows and raped my wife? " when he answered "yes!" the rancher said "you better cut that shit out".
