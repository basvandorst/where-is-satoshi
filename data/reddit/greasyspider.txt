How long have you been using BTC? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:49:20
As a hodler of both, I would think the bitcoin would look at it's decreasing market share since the fork and reflect a bit.  Especially considering that Satoshi explicitly stated that increasing the block size was exactly how to deal with this.

Over where? This is r/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:47:22
If fees and transaction time don't decrease significantly, I am afraid it won't.  I've been hodling since 2011,  The stats are getting worrisome.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:15:37
Why is r/bitcoin so focused on hating other coins?  I have been holding since 2011 and this is truly out of character for the community and frankly it is terrible for the brand.  BTC has stated that it is no longer a currency but a store of value.  BCH is working to be a currency.  According to satoshi, increased block size is how to do it.  Why the hate?
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:41:11
Or just increase the block size and not need to rely on added layers of complexity.  Take BCH for example.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:36:30
I am still confused as to why r/bitcoin talks more about bitcoin cash than bitcoin though.  If BTC is now a store of value and no longer a currency, why continue to hate on it?  It doesn't make any sense to me and hurts BTC more than it BCH.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:21:39
Actually, it's like setting up a Mcdonalds next to a burger stand.  Faster, cheaper, and more convenient.

BTC hodler since 2011.  Currently hodling both coins.  I will that the the BTC we have today is NOT the BTC it was when I first jumped on this bandwagon.   Back then, I could send a few hundred BTC between wallets for almost nothing.  And a few times actually I sent for nothing.  Core has decided it does not want to be a currency, but a store of value. Cash wants to keep things as they were in 2010.  I do not understand the controversy.  Roger Ver is not a BCH dev.  He is an investor that gets media attention.  He has no more to do with it than silk road had to do with btc years ago.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:40:10
I wouldn't know who Roger is if I stepped on him.  I have held BTC since 2010.  Let me tell ya Bud, it ain't what it used to be.  If Bitcoin is to succeed, it can't cost $50 to send a dollar.  This isn't rocket science.    If you are saying that bitcoin is no longer aligned with Satoshi's vision, then BTC is the alt coin now.   If BTC is to now be simply a star of value, it cannot also be a currency.  If it isn't a currency, it isn't Bitcoin.

Stating facts is not "rooting".
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:33:34
So putting money into a "channel" is not at all similar to putting money into a bank? Why have a second layer at all?  I don't recall a second layer discussed in the white paper.  What is discussed is larger blocks.   Anyone can be a node, in theory.  Just like anyone can start a bank.  In theory.  In reality, it will be a handful of whales running the show.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:40:18
Was it Bitcoin Cash, or  Bitcoin Core-by Blockstream™ that had 300,000 unconfirmed transactions and transfer fees so high it was rendered unusable?  In addition, Core has had how many forks since the Bitcoin Cash fork in August?  It is starting to seem like Bitcoin Core-by Blockstream™ is the real alt coin... but that is just me.  I'm no expert though.  I've been hodling since 2010.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:15:47
They are like banks in that they hold a reserve of currency for distribution.  Centralizing the network.  Bitcoin ceases to be peer to peer under LN and becomes peer to node. Stop spreading nonsense.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:40:05
Because it is like the 3rd fork since BCH and none of them have amounted to much...
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:23:10
So what you are saying is that the lightning network will make btc faster and have lower fees? Like BCH? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:02:45
Anti-status quo does not = Russian propaganda.   It is possible that on occasion, Russia speaks the truth.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:06:57
I have youtubed several of Putins speeches, and I gotta say, From where I am sitting it seems like the Russian govt aligns more with the will of the American people than the US govt does.  If we are being objective about it.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:40:48
Wasn’t LN supposed to launch 3 years ago?  I personally don’t know as BTC will survive the next couple of difficultly increases.  Perhaps if ln rolls out.  And everyone starts using it.  Like today.   In any case, it essentially puts blockstream in control.   Doesn’t sound appealing to me in the least.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:58:25
These transaction fees are totally predictable and expected from a 1MB block.  The White Paper states that raising the block size would be necessary to lower fees as  the network grew.  Hence, BCH.   Have you guys ever considered that perhaps a group of miners and or exchanges might be benefiting from these astronomical fees and that is why they continued with "core" despite the original devs recommending increasing the block size?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:18:58
Increasing block size was part of the plan all along.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:44:09
Not saying it is bad, just that it is the project of a company that is heavily funded by central banks.   Not increasing the blocksize went so well for btc, I am skeptical as to how ln will work out.   
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:01:18
Transfer to gdax, convert to BCH then hodl.  Fees are far lower.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:59:46
Yep.  This is why they forked.   Buy BCH.  It is on sale until everyone figures this out.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:29:40
10k-12k is the median right now.  Based on the trends of the last 5 years.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:44:46
Those are BTC fees.  This is why it forked.  Buy BCH and wait for everyone to figure it out.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:49:16
A high of 11,480 and low of 9740 according to Kraken. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:24:48
Yet it is still higher than it was 30 days ago.  Unlike BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:29:56
In 6 months.  ~Blockstream CEO in 2015.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:59:30
BCH was a needed upgrade.  It was the upgrade recommended by the original devs included Craig Wright (who was once thought to be Satoshi Nakamoto).  BTC is now under control of exchanges and miners.  The opposite of its intended purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:02:14
M4eanwhile, BCH is holding.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:35:53
BTC was 11k on Nov 30.  BCH, 1400.

I have no idea what you are trying to say?  Using the MS-DOS analogy would indicate to me that bcash is the way to go.  I am responding to you, not op
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:13:29
If it drops as much as it did in '13, it won't recover and BCH will take over... Judging by difficulty and mining profitability.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:51:57
Huh?  I am simply asking for the evidence that brought you to this conclusion.  I am 50/50 in each because I can't make heads or tails of which coin is real.  After reading the white paper, it seems cash is the true vision satoshi had and that core should not have remained alive.  The only reason it is still kicking is because of the exchanges keeping it going.   I am not saying I am right, or that I believe this, just that this is the conclusion I am closest to given the info I have.  I  am interested in how you came to your conclusion.  Not looking to argue. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:27:52
This would assume that btw is the only crypto that remains viable long term?  Otherwise the theoretical value would be split among the other coins...would it not?

@_date: 2017-11-28 00:29:23
It is as legit as any other alt coin.  What matters is where miners ultimately put their power.  My guess is it will be bch as it would be easiest.   Value is in the eye of the herd.  
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:59:11
Valid point.  The mystery surrounding Satoshi is very suspicious however.  I would it be surprised if Satoshi was actually Goldman or another entity.

This is the reason I hodl ripple.   It seems to me that if the central banks begin issuing their own currency, it would be xrp.

Disrupting the fake fiat money supply and power structure will eventually lead to regulatory assault on bitcoin and crypto IMO.  Unless those cryptos are controlled and sanctioned by the powers that be.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:10:06
I agree.  The threat to the establishment is highly underestimated when it comes to the future of bitcoin.
