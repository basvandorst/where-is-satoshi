I transferred the 6 bitcoin in my Coinbase account to an Electrum wallet. I feel better with them there instead of with Coinbase  anyway. But, Coinbase offered me an easy way to buy bitcoin by linking a bank account. I don't have problem closing my Coinbase account because of this letter but I don't know a better way to buy bitcoin. And I really don't feel I should have to provide the info they're asking for. What if I tell them my source of income for buying bitcoin is male prostitution? What is coinbase going to do with that information?

Why would we complain about the government? Coinbase never said the info was being requested or required from the government.

If that is so, why haven't I gotten those questions from my banks, brokerages, and credit card accounts?

The euro is a paper currency. The two regulated, insured, banks in Cyprus went belly up. People there still lost some of their money.

Would love to see something like this in Costa Rica.

Thanks, I think I understand if I have "watching only" addresses in my Blockchain.info wallet, I do, transactions associated with those addresses will show up in my Blockchain.info transactions and balances. Still not sure why Blockchain.info has the private keys to "watching only" addresses.

A bumbag, daypack, and a Cutler Hammer CH240 40 amp double pole breaker from Amazon via gift card at Gyft. Purchased today.

I would and already do just that. I buy Amazon, Lowes, Cabelas, and Home Depot gift cards through Gyft and EGifter. At one time they carried Walmart gift cards and I loaded up on those too. So sure, I'd use something like that.

Sure, as long as I can add..........Amazon accepts gift cards which can be purchased through Gyft or Egifter which can be purchased with bitcoin.

Don't forget CampBX. Yes, I've read all of the horror stories. I've been using them for over two years now with only minor problems. No more problems than with Coinbase, BTC-e and certainly Mt. GOX.
