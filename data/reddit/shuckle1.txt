Sorry guys. Last night I sold all my bitcoin...cash! Hodl btc until the moon!

Honest question here. I've been involved in BTC since 2013. What are the chances it ever gets that high? I have no idea what limits the price will go to.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:10:26
I'm seriously hoping Mt.Gox will come back up though. I have 16 btc in there and I don't want to lose it.
@_date: 2014-01-02 05:51:29
Email support is taking FOREVER! and i cant even withdraw BTC without verification so I dont know if Ill ever get my BTC out of there :'(
@_date: 2014-09-30 23:16:45
I filled one out as well
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:19:13
I wonder how US customers are going to get their share of everything. Will they have to file any sort of legal documents with the new gox for that?
@_date: 2014-01-02 05:43:40
Im afraid I might never get my BTC or money out of there :(
@_date: 2014-08-04 18:55:43
Edit :)
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:01:09
So youre saying I might get my first tip?! :D
@_date: 2014-01-02 05:41:33
Sadly I can't take out any BTC from Gox :/
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:19:05
Where did you donate the $10 to?

This girl is giving away coins and no one is upvoting her charity? Time to give some upvotes.
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:25:30
Voting for blue on this one
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:41:20
This is insane. Plus the people who lost money in Mt. Gox haven't gotten payed back yet have they?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:07:47
Yupp, here it is I think! I bought at 10k last night and sold at 9.7k like an idiot when it crashed to 8800 then rebounded so I only lost 300 total but damn. I'm just gonna wait for it to settle down now. It grew way too fast in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:44:18
Oh I totally bought at 10k. I can't really see it going down for at least a week. This milestone is too big.
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:57:26
But aren't exchanges such as Coinbase insured?
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:53:25
Why do we need to take our coins out of exchanges? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:43:14
Personally I think long term the bitcoin will get to $5000 or so. we've seen such a huge increase in the last 2 years, I wouldn't expect it to slow down in growth just as it's gaining more and more popularity.
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:45:19
Very nice idea! This will definitely get Bitcoin some publicity!
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:57:39
BUY NOW! the price just dropped a huge amount due to a correction (scared novice speculators leaving the market and panic selling imo). it's bound to go up and I believe you will have quite a big return in less than a year from now. I'm currently holding long term but selling to gain more BTC short term so I say go for it!

"tl;dr - mining by hand is no longer profitable."
Aww :'( tis a sad day in the world of Bitcoin :p
@_date: 2013-12-31 21:50:06
Thanks for the advice. I'm super excited to see how this year plays out with BTC! :D
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:12:59
How is this not age appropriate?
@_date: 2013-12-31 21:50:52
is Mt.Gox really that bad? They do seem to have the highest BTC-USD ratio.
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:24:58
oh shit. and I have a lot of coins in mtgox and cant get them withdrawn without getting verified :/ I;ve already waited a few months to get verified :(
