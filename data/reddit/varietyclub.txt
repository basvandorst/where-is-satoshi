I think that this is one of the clearest mainstream pieces that I have heard on Bitcoin.  They let Mark have long form quotes, they explained on a deeper level how this is a way to circumvent fraud- hell they even nailed the two generals problem.  They even made a great comparison with the first internet companies.

That is a really unhelpful characterization of the report.  Basically the report outlined the risks and the positive parts of Bitcoin and talked about how its future is unknown. 
As a former World Banker I can assure you- this is as glowing of a report as one will see out of there.

In a way he thought that, but my impression is that he also really liked bringing products that made the complicated stuff happen behind the scenes so that ordinary people could use it.  You don't think he would have been creating wallets or other hardware to make this more accessible to regular consumers?

I am the author of this article and I just wanted to write and say thank you to the Bitcoin community for being supportive.  It is really important that all of us keep getting "out there" and talk about the elegance of Bitcoin before FUD crowds in and makes the whole thing a lot harder to get accomplished.  
Cheers to everyone who is willing to be mocked and ridiculed in an effort to find people who can see Bitcoin for what it really is.

In my previous career I spent a lot of time working with economists and academics to help explain their research to lay audiences.  One thing that always seemed to help them get away from using so many details that they killed their audience: use metaphors.
On some level almost everyone uses a metaphor to understand some complex thing.  truly knowing how a single thing works is nearly impossible because like a fractal as you get closer to what you think is the final answer you realize there are only more questions.  In every learning experience we eventually just accept that *this, is like that.*  
As humans the more we have specialization of subjects we don't suddenly become experts in both molecular chemistry and have a deep understanding of biology... for much of the time the places where your specialization overlaps with another you have to use metaphors to learn enough to have a functional knowledge.
The real trick of influence is the ability to make someone believe that your metaphor satisfies their questions without overwhelming.  Try using metaphors that incorporate their own questions... *"Let's talk about 'secure' credit cards... can you tell me a little bit about how your credit card is secure?"* You aren't trying to trap them you are trying to expose that on some level they take a leap of faith in the banking system.  You aren't starting an argument, you are instead showing that very few people really understand things that we use every day (particularly the internet... if you show some non tech person how to run a traceroute and show them what packets are... they are totally blown away) and yet they use the internet every day.
This will inherently open a door (albiet tiny) to suggest that on some level they are placing their trust in a system they don't understand, and that it is always worthwhile for smart people to be curious about new things- and this is a new thing worth paying attention to.  
Often times you have to just open the door a crack, curious people will walk through it and late adopters will need to be told to walk through the door... and that is ok. We should  never be perceived as defensive- but welcoming- Bitcoin should be the most welcoming nurturing place for learning and talking about the metaphors that made us believers too.
TL;DR: All people think in metaphors, you just need to give them a metaphor that satisfies the level of information they think they need.

I actually really appreciated the interview.  I have been interviewed twice on the radio and it is really rare to be given that much time and that many questions that someone knowledgeable can answer.
I felt like the interview was structured so it felt like you had a conversation about something that is complicated (and kind of scary) to non-users. I really liked the interview and am glad everyone agreed to do it.

This is the type of thinking that is not looking broadly enough at the possibilities.  It doesn't matter if there is a use for Bitcoin in the US (there is- but let's ignore that for now) there is a major demand for a currency that doesn't wildly fluctuate all over the world.  Who cares if the Bitcoin are purchased here or there. Since Bitcoin can be used anywhere in the world- as supply remains constant and demand goes up in response to Bitcoin solving a real problem that people have... prices will  also go up.  If you don't believe that, then we are not talking about the same economic theory- and really we need to go back to square one.
Also- just wait when NATO countries start freezing the accounts of Russian oligarchs who are using fiat currencies in Western Banks- suddenly all of Eastern Europe has a major incentive to move their money from a traditional system. 
I think we should all buckle up, the world has already changed and as people realize that, things are going to get turned upside down.

I think the only way that Bitcoin becomes a solid way to donate is if you are donating above a certain level to make it more valuable to avoid the 2.5% credit card fee than the cost of conversion- but there is a break even point and it isn't very high.

fair enough- we will need to judge what companies are coming online to address those issues, but the protocol is certainly not a mirage.

you are totally correct it is estimated (because no one really knows) that paper money only represents less than 8% of all of the US currency. Because even if you had a magical quantum printer you could not keep up with [the amount of money the fed is printing](
@_date: 2014-03-14 15:17:21
yes.  Regardless of the audience I like to start talks by saying something along the lines of:
On November 30th a kid at the University of Auburn was sitting in his dorm room making a sign that he was going to wave in front of the cameras who were there for Saturday's big football game against the Crimson Tide.  Now waving signs in behind the commentator at a game is a bit of a tradition at colleges ever since they started showing games on TV.
While all of the other kids were holding up signs about like "Kappa Gamma Gamma is the best sorority" and "Roll Tide!" this kid had a different plan... Instead of putting up that funny sign that we have seen dozens (if not hundreds of times) when a kid writes "Mom send money!"  which commentators will bump each others elbows joking about the poor college kid using his 15 seconds of fame- knowing his mom won't really send money... This kid held up a sign and it said "Mom send Bitcoin" and it had a little QR code which it turns out was the public address to where people could send Bitcoin.
The commentators chuckled at this sign but people snapped a photo of that QR code and spread it around the internet... no there is no way to know if that kids mom sent Bitcoin, but we do know that over 100 people from all over the world saw that QR code and they sent him donations- totaling over $22,000 worth of Bitcoin.
Think about that for just a second, because while a whole lot of reporters were getting chuckles over that, and the story was shared in sections of newspapers highlighting weird things... we should not look at that as "news of the weird"  in that moment everyone should have realized that the entire world has changed and that kid was proving it right before our very eyes.
He was able to get complete strangers to be able to send him value, like transporting gold over the internet from 100s of people to one single place.  Everyone else can laugh about how he was lucky- but really the Bitcoin community had just demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt that Bitcoin could do something regular money (like dollars) couldn't do.  
This is something that we should pay attention to, so today I am going to teach you what was on that sign (a digital wallet), why people think Bitcoin is safer than other forms of holding value, and I will show you how the world will change if we can send value to anyone in the world with no currency exchange and no need to give away any part of it for security or reliability.
That is what I start with- I am open to corrections and improvements but this seems to give people a concrete example to start to see the value of Bitcoin when they don't understand the protocol. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:55:00
you mean the link? nah- I used to live in Kenya and I like bitcoin so I was going through coinmap and looking to see if anyone in Kenya was using it.
I did it mostly because I want to find out if I can get my old homestay father ( I was a Peace Corps volunteer) a secure wallet, because I know how bad corruption is there (I studied corruption mitigation in graduate school after living in Kenya).  After looking on Coinmap, I realized the infrastructure isn't there even if I did get him a wallet so I thought- "well if I can help move one group forward maybe other businesses would follow... and down the line I could get Bitcoins in the hands of the people that cared for me while I lived there... which I think would really help them out.  
I was hoping that this would lead to a ton of Twitter followers and tweets and hitting them up with support- I am glad to see it is getting up votes, but I would be happy to hear about other ideas to move Bitcoin forward in Kenya (this seemed like a teeny tiny first step).

With that amount of time you will want to focus on telling a story that illustrates how the Bitcoin system works.  Consider just telling your story and how it has impacted you. Keep it genuine, and give only enough "facts" to validate that you know what you are talking about.  Arguments are won by stories that explain.  And stories are shareable so you can create more evangelists with stories than facts!
You won't have time to give the ends and outs- your only goal should be to cultivate curiosity and give them a really good way to learn more...

Buffet flat out said in that interview that the economy was saved by central banking jumping in and providing liquidity to money market accounts which had ground to a halt.  Bitcoin doesn't need or want intervention which means we spread the power of how to use the money system among all the people using the system not the people with the licenses to start the printing presses.

When he says that, he is playing for the camera- he is a master of PR. The companies he is investing in for BH - Geiko, CocaCola, railroad, energy- are using massively complex technology. He is pretending to be a down home guy about this stuff- it serves to re-enforce his grandfather image. No way he doesn't see the value of spending money safely without fees. His opinion is an act- he is absolutely capable of understanding this. 
The BTC community should take him to task over his statements about Bitcoin because the general public will build their mental arguments against Bitcoin based on that single quote they will read.  Our PR strategy must be to call people to task that slam Bitcoin without using arguments against the protocol.  
Speaking up and explaining what Bitcoin is and how the protocol works is of vital importance and exactly why everyone that is even remotely capable should be talking non-stop about the system.  It is the only way to win hearts and minds and it is public opinion that will determine how quickly mankind will adopt digital currency.
I am 100% willing to help people practice explaining Bitcoin.  I am going on the radio, contacting print reporters, speaking before chambers of commerce and talking at tech startup meetings and I am practicing relentlessly to figure out the best way to explain Bitcoin to lay people.  I will share my pitch letters, talk about how to explain your point of view, look over slides that people are using at meetups and offer the best advice I can about becoming better.  
I do this professionally and I am deeply committed to digital currency, I hope people will direct message me if I can help in any way- we are going up against the established system that mocks this very complicated thing we must get better and better every day, and the way we will do that is by sharing what is working.
TL;DR Warren Buffet is a master of PR, his opinion is just being used to re-enforce his down home persona. We should all be talking about why he is wrong.  I will help anyone get ready for news interviews or presentations to help win hearts and minds of the general public.

It isn't informative as far as teaching us about BTC, more it shows how they are thinking.  The presenter made BTC seem like a magic thing, couldn't describe hashing, and they talked about it being scary because there aren't "consumer protections."

Time is worth money and Bitcoin could have saved me over 2 hours in that example alone- there must be millions of these examples.

No, this logic is not correct that are aware and have been for a long time.  I meet with many heads of large banking institutions (not quiet as big as multi-billions -but certainly people in charge of multimillions...) and you would not believe how many of them know nothing more than Silk Road or the unicorn on business week.  
Many of the people running these gigantic institutions have come up through the traditional channels, many (not all) barely know how to use their iPhones fluidly let alone being capable of conceptualizing a virtual currency network.
They may be learning now, but this is a change over the last few weeks/months, not "long ago."

That is very fair and very good that you are pressing for real answers.  
In a country where the currency appears very stable and we have a banking system that is working very well (relative to the past or other countries without strong banking systems) then the first real place of value is the donation economy.
Right now millions of people donate billions of dollars to charities [(citation)]( and if they do that using a credit card 2.5% of their donation goes to the credit card companies.  If you could decide that you were going to donate a certain amount of money you could purchase that amount of Bitcoin and then send it to them (if they have a digital wallet) without loosing 2.5% of the value.  Sure you won't see all donations going that way but we could easily see that being one major benefit right away.  
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:06:00
No, you should not invest everything you have saved into Bitcoin. You should put only into Bitcoin that which you are willing to loose. I really like Bitcoin, I like the system, I like its potential but there is just too much volatility and risk close out your bank account and put it all in Bitcoin
