Whats even funnier is you have a post from 4 years ago clearly stating you couldn’t afford to buy more bitcoins at 1000 dollars, and how you’d wish they’d drop back down to $200 USD.

I think your confused, mainstream adoption on a peer to peer basis, bitcoin was a system meant to get away from central control, and that would mean institutions and banks as they were the ones who screwed it up in the first place.
But as you stated if bitcoin succeeds, it hasn’t in general, neither has it by adoption because over 40% of BTC are owned by a few and the market is niche.
If you knew about markets and what adoption means you would see a far higher price today if bitcoin was a success and you clearly” don’t”.
Recently two large hedge fund managers have clearly stated no one on their books has asked for exposure to BTC, why because like I’ve told you already it way to risky as an investment.
Nakamoto could crass the BTC price down to dollars just by realising his coins onto the market, that’s not favourable for investors who could put large amounts of cash in.
There is no insurance, you can’t insure something that’s borderless, people can play the game in their own back yard so to speak, but others elsewhere effect the price, a butterfly flaps its wings in one country and causes a hurricane in another.
This is why they won’t get a bitcoin traded or linked ETF.
And if they ever do BTC may as well die as it would become centralised poop.

Everything in that reply is complete crap, yes of course other countries are going to dump American debt and hurt themselves in the process, you should read more, America’s debt is a fallacy, used by stupid people to try and win an argument they can’t.
I’m not bothered about BTC price, you’ve missed the point and you need to learn about bitcoins price correlation with its adoption, try reading some books.
I can do an international transfer in 15 minutes with my bank in the uk, you’ve seriously got a bad bank if your having to do what you’ve said, you’re talking rubbish for the sake of talking.
The reason bitcoin won’t be used for international transfers anytime soon is clearly its too volatile.
They get by with swift as they don’t need to settle immediately, just because something maybe slower doesn’t mean it’s useless.
Bitcoiners crying out wait this does it better doesn’t mean it will get used, really I’m dumbfounded you can’t see it, brain washed.

Serious enough to see that most of the issues I addressed to you, you’d never even considered, they’re called potential market risks.
Most serious investors wouldn’t touch BTC other than the novelty factor, so I don’t care how invested you are.

He said that if the price dropped low enough that the miners had to sell their equipment, that equipment would be sold off cheap because no one would want it, and whoever bought it could preform some form of attack.
I suppose he’s correct in a situation like that, I don’t know what kind of an attack he means, I’m guessing a 51% attack.
Like right now I’m guessing the BTC price is in some way being manipulated down, my reason for saying this is, I believe people want to buy in cheap as they can, hence the price is being held back.
Buy in cheap or cheaper as they clearly see large gains ahead.

This ETF stuff is boring now, they’re not going to issue one” simple”.
And all this talk about something that may happen just gives a false price, only for that price to tank right down again.
Good for speculators but is not good if you want adoption, general public just see these price swings as more of a reason not to buy BTC or other.
If you’re truly at the point where the BTC price is so stagnant because people are not adopting it, and you’ve come to rely on institutions and government bodies for price increases, then I’m afraid to say BTC has failed in the way it’s creator envisaged.

Normal people don’t want to walk down the streets in the uk to see reprobates of the like we talk, with their banners and bullshit we’ve heard it all before speech’s.
They’re weak people with empty lives, so twisted because they’ve failed in life and would like to blame others from elsewhere or other religions for their own failings.

Adoption is new investors, what people use BTC do they without buying it hahahaha, do you know hardly any where accepts it.
That’s not adoption seriously.
Yes the global housing market relies on new investors.
BTC can’t go anywhere unless more people adopt buy in, that isn’t happening.
Niche market that’s why the price is £5k uk, well what do you expect 40% of BTC are owned by a few people, the rest spread between 17 million max.
TX are well down even including batching so less adoption.
Considering there are 8 billion world wide and bill gates or Jeff bezos could buy all the BTC in existence you see it’s a flee on an elephants back.

Bitcoins dyeing, the price shows it’s not being adopted.
When it’s having to rely on mainstream financial institutions for its long term price boost that’s not good.
Facts are the hodlers are holding the price up, if everyone starts selling that price will soon drop way lower than it is today.
Facts are it’s really not working other than in its niche market.
Literally everything is not working for it, power consumption compared to price is way high.
Then there is all the price lies, none of them are anywhere near what they have been touted as because the truth is, price Spurs adoption and adoption Spurs price, neither is happening in a wider context.
The price is what it is because of the people involved no more, cut half those people back and the price will more than half ect ect..., you can be a realist or lie to yourself.

Having an ETF granted doesn’t take away risk, all it does is transfer it to the brokerage that buys the BTC for customers, it’s a case of maybe they can keep them safe or maybe not.
Doesn’t take many mistakes to get hacked and the last thing you want is to lose  millions in rich peoples money.
The fall out from this would rubbish BTC for ever, it’s way different from an exchange getting hacked.

If the government of a country decided they would buy BTC, the more they bought and stored the less would be available for others, this would in effect create a supply issue and if interest from others to buy was there it would push the price higher.
But it would be very difficult to own all the BTC as not everyone would sell, and even if you wanted them to you’d have to pay ever increasing amounts for them.

I suppose the death spiral part, I personally don’t agree with the article as it seems to clean cut and matter of fact, where as you say there are to many variables.
I mean I cannot see a death spiral for BTC, he’s basically saying when no one uses it and thus miners fees make it not profitable any more.
But that is incorrect anyway, as wouldn’t the algorithm adjust down, even if BTC went back to home computer mining and was only worth a few dollars or no dollar, it still isn’t exactly the end as he’s saying, am I right in my thinking.

Just out of interest, I don’t really understand “LN” I understand that you have to fund a channel with BTC to be able to participate.

You’re clearly the most stupid person I’ve met on reddit, of course when no one was buying BTC it had no value, as people bought in the value rose.
You’re so stupid you even disagree with the person who conceived the idea, in fact his own words were FOMO.
It’s kinda when the next buyer pushes the price higher and then more people buy, I think this is what’s deemed as adoption.
But if you can’t see a correlation and you’ve invested money as a hedge without even knowing what fundamentally drive the market price you’re stupid.
I mean xmas 2017s price was adoption and manipulation, but the price didn’t get to 20k usd without people buying in, dumbass you could see this in the TX volumes.

Well that’s not absolutely true as “LN” transaction are way quicker than anything on the planet, it’s that on Blockchain transactions aren’t fast.
But those transaction clear within 6 confirmations, visa, swift or other can’t confirm a transaction that fast (meaning the money is yours and can’t be taken back.
As for volatility that is to be expected in a young market, liquidity for sure would calm volatility, but I’d rather that liquidity come from other sources than institutions, which wasn’t what satoshi planned.
The problem also with the public is they don’t invest other than in ISA or the odd company shares with guaranteed returns.

Bitcoin wasn’t meant to be about institutions and mainstream financial systems, you should read the white paper, it was a vision of a peer to peer network void of financial system like I’ve mentioned.
Also if you understood that because of all of the greedy people in BTC that don’t understand its true cause, you’d realise that to get an ETF you’re going to need to eliminate this space of corruption.
The reason for this is let’s say someone is blind enough to grant an ETF licence and those investors get ripped of in one way or another “and they probably will” any price increases that BTC may  have gained will be eradicated in an instance and all faith will be lost by institutional investors.
That would mean a rapid tanking of the BTC price down to tens of dollars and everyone sells on mass.
That’s why ETFs may look like a great prospect, but what the SEC can grant they can take away.
The BTC price gains were meant to come by adoption “public adoption” not mainstream financial institutions.
That’s why BTC won’t get an ETF, or at least till a time when the manipulation has gone and the bad players, considering some CEO did a runner the other day with 30 odd million I think the BTC isn’t there as regards it’s own regulation yet.
You will say WTF when you lose your money, you’ve been advised.
And do you really believe that just because BTC gets an ETF everyone will all of a sudden trust it?
No no and no are the answers.
The general public want solid insured guarantees.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:09:21
But there not it’s going to be regulated how those powers want it.
Taxed like they want it, and Blockchain monitored like they want it.
They will basically own it, it’s happening now.
It will die, it is dyeing slowly, the majority can’t be arsed with it, it’s geek money, you can’t spend it and buy the time you do it’s worth less.
The banking system is all powerful, the fed can’t go bust ever they can create money for ever if they choose.
Bitcoin is a little niche market that’s it.
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:03:51
Yes, basically you’re correct, BTC price is fuelled by speculation and adoption, but the price will fuel adoption.
If your 10k BTC dive to 1k that’s because the market participants are selling, the price will only rise when people buy in.
It’s a Pyramid scheme, let’s say we had a market now and no one else joined and BTC wasn’t used by anyone else, it’s price would be stagnant for a while, until that is some people in the market caught wind of what’s going on, those people would start selling and as more sold and the price went lower more and more sell, until no one can sell because the Blockchain can’t handle how many people want to cash out.
But when the price is rising, people want in through FOMO, when those people buy they push the price up, and then more people are attracted and it goes up and up.
Adoption up, or people selling out has a correlation with the price up or down.
Or ask yourself if you woke up tomorrow and the BTC price was 1000usd  you’d clearly know there has been a huge sell off, less people in the marked (minus adoption).
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:13:51

There are many BTC haters, if ETFs get approval and investors lose money through fraud ect.., the BTC price and confidence in crypto could be damaged badly.
Done correctly and patiently with the correct insurances and regulation then it could be big.
I worry also that a borderless decentralise network, isn’t ideal for centralised financial regulation, my meaning is that regulation on one continent isnt law on another and the price can be manipulate as its borderless.
Also know one knows who satoshi is, maybe he’s a pure bank hater, having nearly a million BTC to dump on the market at will, would kind of scare me as a big investor, he could crash the price in theory.
The above is far fetched but slightly possible.

Well I was in BTC well before 2017 and I remember a time when BTC wasn’t worth much at all.
I’m not saying if you read it’s not up, I’m saying that it should be higher IMO that it is, based on technological breakthroughs, software advancements and general good news.
Also debatably if adoption is growing the price should be higher.
My view is the price is being manipulated to lower levels because clearly institutions want to buy BTC before they can’t hold back price spikes, just how the price is being manipulated down I don’t know, but I’m convinced it is.

No it doesn’t, the volatility makes no difference as long as the seller gets in dollar, sterling, Euro or other what the house was worth when advertised and the estate agent gets their cut.
It’s the BTC or other crypto holder who takes the volatility by either paying more or less, depending upon the volatility, on a good day he or she would receive more good or service for their BTC, or on a bad day less goods.
End result is that the shop, restaurant, or in this case seller and estate agent gets their advertised sale price.
Personally I see a better day when we do away with the estate agent middleman and sell direct, but that’s a discussion for another day.

That’s because they’re not and it’s a stupid idea.
You can’t regulate decentralised, borderless tokens, that is impossible, regulation in one area doesn’t effect another, it’s the Wild West, that’s fine for decentralised but when you start letting in centralised companies that deal with rich peoples money “��ummmm there may be trouble ahead”.
Fraud is rampant, it only takes one person who has access to a private key to say hey I’m off, and run away into the sunset.
BTC isn’t ready for this shit, payment system first as envisaged, and patience, not full blown greed, it make you as bad as the banks.

Why would institution or any investor wait out a bear market, surely it’s the best time for buying.
And those cost 15 million per day mined, they must be selling those amounts to cover the electric costs, isn’t OTC trades liable to take up a lot of these sales.
Personally I think most of the people who invested late 2017 are either cleaver enough to know they must hodl and wait out any losses they occurred by buying at the top of the market.
Or they’re long gone. Sold out ages ago as we are in August now.

Crypto doesn’t have problems scaling, your confused, BTC could scale over visa levels from day one by just using VPN wallets as satoshi said it could.
But we have segwit now and moved to LN, which can also scale a lot higher that visa, hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, even increasing block sizes can scale.
The scaling debate is over.

You miss the bigger picture about banks, I find it quite pathetic really, I’m presuming your from the U.K., if you are you should look at today’s rally by the TUC, real wage growth in the U.K. has been squeezed so badly since 2008 banking fiasco, that real term wage growth won’t return to normal till 2025, to equate that in finance in real terms it means each worker will have lost around £18,500.
You talk about banks as though they don’t cost tax payers money, your even wrong about overall bank charges, business accounts have higher charges than anything you’ve mentioned, in fact Lloyd’s charge £100 per annum just for an overdraft facility.
So when you also take into consideration the cost to the tax payers kitty from bank bail outs, you’ll clearly see that banking fees and only half the story.
And by the way an international transfer has a £15 charge and often isn’t clear for days.
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:05:08
No no no no,you don’t understand BTC because the price may well be up from the 2 dollars days, but the price today shows it’s not being adopted.
When people sell the price goes down, less adoption.
When the price rises people buy more adoption.
The BTC price isn’t adopting, since dec 2017 many have left.
Your deluded if you think the *FLOOR* as you put it can’t go lower, Urrrrr there is no floor, anything could take BTC down and down further, FLOORS are for fools who believe and don’t air caution.

If you watch the videos, buffet, gates, munger, you clearly see none of them understand bitcoin, even gates is trying to split the bitcoin from the Blockchain.
This guy is right, we should ignore them,buffet invested $130 million in silver a non producing asset as he clearly states he doesn’t invest in.
Gates just doesn’t have big enough balls to disagree even if he did (pathetic) so let them  go.
They like most people fail to see that technology produces productive things, because bitcoin is a programmable technology, it can help cure problems now, and into the future as those layers are added to the Blockchain, this is how bitcoin produces in real term scenarios.
Sure a farm produces corn or munger beans but that’s all they are always, BTC can change and adapt to new problems through software upgrades when those problems arise and are cured, this adds mor productivity than corn or munger beans, they just can’t grasp it.

Fiats in the future ehhh, the federal reserve can create as much money as they like forever.
Errr and it’s not a fact that people clearly need it, yet again check the BTC price and work out the link between price and adoption, don’t lie to yourself.
Please that doom and gloom scenario is the only way BTC can succeed is laughable, and when is this great event coming ehhh, or is that more guess work.
You’re completely misguided about BTC price and it’s link to adoption,so let me explain so it sinks in.
When it’s tanking that’s people dumping ok, when it’s climbing that’s people buying.
So when it’s stagnant no ones buying as if they were there would be price movement.
Speak based on fact, not rubbish and conspiracy theories.

Don’t forget when the price is tanking it’s people selling, meaning less adoption, I’m sure even you could work out what the opposite means.

I know all about tether also, that’s manipulation of a price, Nouriel Roubini has pointed this out also long ago.
Now for you especially you, what do you think happens to the price or a stock or commodity when all the market dumps.?
That’s right it goes down, sometimes becomes worthless, now the exact same effect makes the price increase it’s called buyer adoption.
There is nothing to BTC price other than speculation and people who buy in.
Enlighten me on anything that has made BTC price have more realistic value?
Facts it’s slow.
Without LN it would have failed as a payment rail.
Not many retailers accept it, for you that mean niche.
40% is owned by a few, the rest is owned by about as many people as the price reflects, and that’s a few million max.
Are you seeing yet how the price does or does not spur adoption?????
I could go on to murder you a bit more but why as you’ve not even gave any reasons why it’s price increases any other way.
In fact I think you’re so retarded that you clearly wouldn’t understand why so many are so desperate for an ETF (which may i add IMO goes against what BTC should’ve been for in the first place) they’re desperate because its stagnant *NO ONE IS BUYING IN* that’s why the price won’t move between a few hundred dollars.
���� but clearly there is no correlation between price increase and adoption.

Oh please don’t bore me little boy, as again you couldn’t answer the questions.
What this shows is you think you know BTC and you don’t, I’m glad you’re in it for fun, in my opinion sooner or later you’ll get your pants pulled down because you have not a lot of knowledge.
I’ve watched most of Andreas YouTube links, * AND WHAT*?
Yes he’s knowledgable and I agree with most of what he says, but then many people have believed in what others have said before and it’s come to no avail.
*ADOPTION* matters more than you could believe.
You asked the most stupid question earlier about fiat, fiat doesn’t need adoption to succeed, that’s correct, FIAT is the people’s money it doesn’t need adoption, BTC does and what ever any one thinks unless it gets it, it will fail.
Your probably far from stupid, I’m just arrogant and playing with you (NO OFFENCE INTENDED) but you mentioned Apple earlier, and Apple is only a success because it gave us * *THINGS*, if those things hadn’t been adopted Apple would be valued at zero.
Question can BTC do what Apple has done and why?
You couldn’t answer this, Andrea thinks he can, that’s in an ideal world where the masses listen, at the moment they’re not.
FACT most people are not interested in BTC, ask them, they’re not interested because they get a wage, a safe steady supply.
BTC is volatile, nor safe or steady, most people have debt, they don’t have spare money, IMO the task for BTC is an up hill battle.

Wait I see what your saying hahahahahaha, you think that the best time to buy is in *YOUR WORDS fomoing* (fear of missing out) and you think that because the price will be rising.
NO NO NO. You buy in a  bear market as the crypto is cheap, you hold and sell when the bull market has run its course.

Because the greater fool investors aren’t lining up, like people thought they would.
Does that sound about right.

Once  joe public’s wallet was hacked or their fake Blockchain s where attacked in some ways, then the banking system would be in chaos, just look at TSB in U.K., CHAOS.

No it doesn’t this is all bullshit.
Anyone with half a brain know that if this was happening BTC price would be rising rapidly as this would be classed as adoption.
If the BTC price is dropping or is stagnant it’s not being used or adopted.
It was simply laid out that BTC price increases to a point where people buy BTC.
Then the BTC price lure takes over FOMO
(Fear of missing out) when it’s price climbs higher and higher through adoption.
It’s the price that spurs adoption and the adoption that pushes prices higher.
If all these people are running to buy BTC in these countries the price would be rising and it’s dropping so this is rubbish.

Problem there is, it’s fine to surmise something is different or ground breaking and BITCOIN may well be, the problem is, if the public aren’t interested in change it won’t work, and that’s no matter how good it could be.
And at the end of the above thread it stated this is why more and more people embrace bitcoin each day, which is wrong wrong wrong.
Yet again if more and more people were investing or embracing BTC each day the price would be rising, NOT DROPPING, NOT STAGNANT, or relying on institutional money or news.
The above are facts, be as blind as you like, but say it works when it is, not when it’s not.

You can’t answer can you, your intellect is slow, I mean you could of said innovation Spurs price increase, MAST, TAP ROOT, GRAFT ROOT ect the list goes on, then I would have said *NO IT DOESNT*, because if you take a close look at the market all these things do little too increase price.
Why because adoption increases with price so if the price doesn’t increase people aren’t interested and the price simply doesn’t increase.
There is no way BTC can do anything unless more people buy in.
It’s not called bigger fool investment either, it’s called greater fool *like you* get it right.
But yes it’s a Ponzi like the housing market or stock exchange, being a Ponzi isn’t bad, but it means it relies on other investors (adoption for you) if it doesn’t receive that fix it dies and so does it’s price.

Bitcoin is dyeing a slow death, but a death none the less, it will either end up being another financial instrument for mainstream financial institutions.

What’s so so funny about your response and also buffets response, is that buffet is heavily invested in gold, and gold itself is a non productive asset.
Money that is invested into gold doesn’t produce any kind of real economic growth.
Personally I think BUFFET, is your classical idiot with money, most produced by luck.
He understands nothing about tech and people only listen because he’s got money, but he’s been wrong multiple times, and his statement about bitcoin may be right that it’s not productive but neither is gold so he’s a fool to not point that fact out also.
Fair is fair.
And may I add gold isn’t classed as an investment either for the reason it doesn’t produce anything, unlike stocks and bonds.

Rubbish fiat currencies have 8 billion ish people backing their faith, they also have the lender of last resort and armies behind them.
BTC has little apart from a few million that are convinced it won’t fizzle out, hello it all ready is as it’s not being adopted.
Plus yet again another person who cannot answer the question who is relying on basing BTC like fiat, by saying what gives fiat value.
Fiat is massive BTC is a flea, barely more than a milk token, that’s why asking why it has value is way more pertinent.
Simple fact tax trades by 80% that would collapse the trading market and over night BTC would be worth a few dollars at most, and that would be before everyone else panic sold.
People aren’t interested in it period, the adoption rate shows this and that adoption rate is set against its dismal price.
Think about what you’ve said, there are only 16 million in circulation, rare and only rare because no one is interested in buying into them, people into BTC are brain washes into believing there is a mythical door and behind that door there are millions of people who want in like all of you clever people.
But there are no millions of people, or they would be in already, why would anyone wait to buy in at a higher lever and not a low one????
It’s rubbish that’s why.
Is that sound money when it is tanking down.?
Or sound money when it’s rising?
Or sound money when it’s being manipulated.?
Or sound money when people tokens are hacked ?.
That to the general public doesn’t look so much sound money, more like risky involvement.
Sound money with a fixed supply as a global currency won’t work* here why*, all economies need to increase their money supply from time to time regardless to spur growth which makes us wealthier in the long term.
A fixed supply would hinder that process and cause untold damage to a countries economy, when you look at the real truth BTC is niche but could never replace fiat systems, anyone who proposes so is a fool of the highest order.
Simply it won’t work.
Also people who own BCH say theirs is sound money, the point here being that *you can’t create money from nothing*, oh but wait THATS A FALICY ALL SO because you can and that’s what BCH is, and all the other folks that have happened, either way new tokens exist.
Let’s go further I mean how many times can we split a satoshi down, micro satoshi, maybe a mini micro satoshi, who knows it’s code we could go down and down.
The point is under serious analysis the whole sound money argument doesn’t hold up.
Plus most western nations have no need for it, a debit card is faster and also insured and accepted globally in all shops, why do we need BTC, what does it fix or cure.
It’s not anonymous, you can’t generally spend it, I can’t interact with my bank with it or from account to account, they aren’t compatible, being immutable is a weakness and not the strength it’s sold too be.
Private keys addresses are complicated for users without a QR code to scan.
There are way to many security vectors like master seeds ect.. that have to be kept safe, the general public want security, insurance, ease of use, and acceptance, * BTC offers not one of these things in real terms (NOT ONE), so it’s easy like I originally said to the other guy on this thread that the BTC is what it is because it’s not being “ADOPTED” and only a higher price will spur more adoption.
It is a Pyramid scheme end of discussion, these are the facts no matter what a book says that Andreas may or may not have wrote, and it’s long term chances of survival are slim.
Apple the company have wealth because they create products that the public desire, for BTC to work it would have to have the same appeal as the new IPHONE, then those sales create wealth which reflects in the share price.
BTC produces nothing ZERO and it’s not ever going to be as popular as the latest phone, this is why it’s market cap is ridiculously small.
It doesn’t produce anything meaningful.
And it looks like it’s not going to anytime soon.
Price predictions are based on investors trying to pump their investment nothing more, until it produces value other than through speculation its already dead.
That’s the sobering really of niche products that have little utility.

No no no no, you don’t understand the word Pyramid, or what a Pyramid scheme is, I’ve just tried showing you that BTC needs new investors to survive that a Pyramid  scheme.
Would you like a link sending so you can educate your self on how they work?
No it’s not a store of value either, a store of value has a steady price, volatility doesn’t count for a store of value, stupid people who listen to others say this.
ECONOMIC NODES �� what are they the same as computer nodes hahahaha.
LN is only in beta.
*this is sound money not a Pyramid* ummm so you’re saying the global housing market which is worth trillions isn’t sound money ???????
As that housing market is a Pyramid scheme as those house values and it’s stability rely on new buyers (Pyramid).
And the last part is bollocks with a capital B, there may be people use BTC in those countries but not many, some, their skink (poor) struggling to feed themselves, and the BTC price doesn’t show that kind of adoption.
Censorship resistant doesn’t mean regulation resistant you decide which has more power, I’d think that was obvious
And it’s a poor medium of exchange, ironically it has to be pegged to fiat to make it work, because it to volatile.

Here’s why it’s better, firstly your transaction confirms quicker than Visa, swift and other payment networks, you may not get it, but after only 6 confirmations on the Blockchain your money is there”settled” can’t be taken back and no middle man, with future fees lower and lower.
And it is way faster, none of what you mention is reality, only cash is instant and you can’t use cash in many situations to send money, it has to be face to face so it’s ultra limiting, plus you can’t send micro payments.
Read this Bitcoin is better period and more secure, the debate was over a long while ago. 
There may be those that try to argue it but that would be silly, and this is before a fully working LN network.

There is a reason for open source protocol and you have missed it, the reason for having many coins is a good thing and not a bad thing, let me explain.
BTC is a programmable protocol as you well know, what a lot of people miss isn’t what BTC can do now, but what it can do in the future so if you have lots of competing coins some may have valid usage in their programmed software that may suit BTC in the future, meaning those good parts can be added making BTC better.
We all know most will fail, that’s not the point, the point is any good bits can be used, this leaves dedicated people working on each coin rather than just BTC and it’s a brain pooling experiment in many ways, early days yet.
Bitcoin is revolutionary for the reason it’s never finished and that it is programmable as money, store of value, smart contracts, and many other, all kept secure via a dedicated Blockchain.

Debt, credit, hidden fees that fools don’t see, stealth tax from elsewhere making up for what you think you don’t pay. 
Oh and Payments on you’re  home loan that by the time you’ve payed it off, you’ll have payed enough to buy 2 or three houses, “yes of course you beat inflation we all do geez wake up sonny.”
It’s called the never never what you speak of, that’s the reason most are in debt, your an idiot to believe you’re getting away with a good deal, maybe one of those kicks in the head would wake you up, please think a little harder.
And you’re  from the states right, well you’re  getting screwed buddy with health insurance ect, you’re less free than people in many other places in the world and you’re  banking system is probably the most controlling on the planet.
America is bollocks, there is no freedom, the American dream died after the 50s and 60s, it’s been down hill since then and is going all the way down.
You’re  given you’re  home loan, not out of the kindness of their hearts but because they want too enslave “you into a payment cycle that lasts for years, “taking away some more of you’re freedom, and tying you to you’re  mundane job, which in turn pays them tax.
You’re  given you’re  car from the car dealer ship and malls and shops, so that you have somewhere to spend you’re earning, buying crap so you may feel a little better about you’re  sad existence, we are all lead in this way, it’s called control,and buying that crap never makes us feel better.
This cycle repeats!!!!!.
They create competition so you’re  pay rise is small, because you daren’t ask for more because there is a ready surplus of joes just like you waiting for employment.
“Take a look at the big picture”,

I think it does, I believe that Bitcoins true potential can only be realised with faster payments with low fee.
I believe the gateway for mass adoption is through LN, without it BTC will be around in some form and have some use, but for sure the big money is through LN capability.
I believe people are fickle, like kids with a video game are, they soon loose interest and move on, and they also easily forget.
It’s not like BTC doesn’t have competition either, and every NO coiner always uses the argument that BTC can’t scale and never will be able too.
I agree with all you’ve said but IMO 2 years is the max we want for this system to be user friendly and rolled out on mass, this can truly be the silver bullet for BTC to be a world beating  payment system.

All the lost coins you talk of which were down to criminal activity, the perpetrators will be dealt with, lost bitcoins make other bitcoins worth more.
Mining groups aren’t cartels, they are in competition, cartels own the whole Shebang like OPEC owns oil, this isn’t the case with bitcoin.

Is it more that the algorithm adjusts only to the computing power, more hashing power equals harder algorithm, and less computational power equals easier algorithm like in the early days.?
But why isn’t there a link between higher computation power, and BTC price,?
There must be some link or the BTC price when the algorithm is easy to break, wouldn’t always be low, and it was always low.
The more people buy in with prices rising then the higher the price goes and the more computational power is needed to secure the transaction and find new Bitcoins, So there must be a link as he’s saying in the article?

Thanks for the reply, that’s a lot less than what I was thinking, I thought for a set up like that you’d be looking at 30k uk.
So is my chain of thought correct also, that apart from halving events which in theory should increase the BTC price, most of the BTC price is market movement up or down, rather than mining influencing the price?
And if I am correct if a Bitcoin does become worth say 50k, mining with a 7k to 10k rig could be highly profitable going forward.
More a win win win situation as electric will only rise at normal market rate but BTC could in theory rise dramatically.?

I don’t think you know or have been anywhere that has poor people, if you had you know that the last thing they have is money to invest.
Your kinda contradicting yourself as one moment your talking about people who earn a dollar a day, then mention investing.
When you have a dollar a day it goes everyday on just living.

I think most of his points are perhaps correct, I’d argue that there are many people who don’t understand bitcoin enough yet to be tempted in investing.
I also think wallet adoption will have peaks and troughs also, and not be as consistent at times.
But ultimately he’s correct about adoption, this is one reason Bitcoin need LN as fast as is possible.
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:42:12

Well you should go and read more on LN, general consensus is that LN will work, of course it is still in its early days, but there is no rush like a lot of people think.
I can’t really be bothered to argue about weather LN will or won’t work as most computer scientists have already agreed it will and is, and it’s fast.

There are already companies like bit pay I think that work on that point of sale model, the cost of the item is irrelevant.
When people talk of BTC losing its volatility IMO it’s a bad thing, as you open up one industry and loose a huge part of another, trading is BTC,s biggest usage at present and people are making a good living, there will be less and less to make if volatility goes away.
So I personally see no reason that it’s volatility needs to be curbed, as long as point of sale rule is applied.
Bitcoin by design is meant to make everyone wealthier, this it cannot fail upon as long as we have adoption.
The latter is it’s only challenge converting for want of a better word the stupid or the lazy, we can forgive the old.

Their  deluded their banking is free they don’t see the bigger picture, if governments bail out banks with large sums of tax payers money which periodically they do, this tax payer money doesn’t get spent in-society on important things, this has a loss effect.
Also when on occasion interest rates are negative which we have seen, you end up paying the banks to keep your money.
Banks have large cross border fees and considering most people on this post aren’t sending large amounts into there hundreds of thousands they are ill informed as to the true fee costs of sending money through banks.

You were correct about the LN network only working on smaller payments at present, larger payments would have to be split and sent via multiple channels to their destination.
But LN is basically designed for everyday payments, it’s faster than anything that exist now (way faster) and the fee is usually only one satoshi, which no other payment provider can compete with.
The larger payments would be better done on chain, as I’ve been told that the fees on chain for large payments are very cost effective compared to traditional ways of sending money.
LN may well be able to do a few thousand dollars in time, and that’s really all it needs to do.
Either way you look at the technology it’s probably going to increase money velocity because it settles faster, creating more wealth in society, and making BTC tokens worth multiple times what they are today.
This is a game changer, even if people have doubts, IMO it will work.
Plus it can do micro payments which no other payment system has ever been able to do.
It’s plain evolution in play.

No I said institutional money didn’t buy in on mass like this guy was told it would when the hash rate was down, because I pointed out to him that the hash rate had been that low before.
And I did not say institutional money wasn’t in, I said institutional money can’t control all BTC or the network.
My comprehension is fine by the way, I’m wondering though if it’s you who can’t comprehend what I am saying?
And if you think institutional money is the sole reason for crypto price swings you need to look at the bigger picture, you are clearly wrong on that also.
I think you will find that these institutions are in no great rush as the guy said for anything crypto, they have other markets they can play in all day with far larger returns.
And you clearly have not one clue about supply and demand metrics, let me explain in simple terms for you for the future.
Firstly when you have a limited supply of tokens and large buy orders are coming in daily, that makes the supply less thus this action pushes up the prices of the tokens.
Also you will see way larger transaction volumes.
Theory if so many institutional investors and their  trillions were buying up BTC then we would see large and steady price increases.
As for the above we are not and haven’t, most price increase even upto 20’000 US was public FOMO, nothing more.
These institutional investors are not in yet believe me, and believe the supply and demand model.

Just my opinion, I can’t save the world but I cannot condone something that’s purer crookery either.
Not sure I’m with you on international payment there, as I suppose it depends how much your sending ultimately, I get charged £15 by my bank for each transaction internationally, and I’m not sending thousands or hundreds of thousands.
I can’t comment on the latter my knowledge doesn’t go that far, but I’d be interested to see some info on that if you have it.
What are your thoughts on “LN” then or future add ons for BTC are they all a waste of time and effort, clearly I see more and more institutions and people not saying bad things, but more good.

People should not use or accept it if they are worried about volatility PERIOD.

There probably will never be mast adoption ��, so FUD is spread by people especially on here LIKE REST IN PEACE BITCOIN haha, when this is rubbish here’s my guess why.
People are sheep, most can’t be helped.
Some think it’s a scam, some think it’s cool not to buy in, so no mast adoption.
So let the capitalists buy them all in one way or another, they have the money and they know there  are usages for this tech, they will make the masses use it in one form or another without them even knowing they are, especially in payment networks.
Because the masses don’t own them they don’t profit from their price rise, kinda you had your chance and didn’t take it haha, some of the public who have faith and patience will benefit financially over time who are brave enough to ignore volatility and FUD.
Either way BTC and the network is going to do things like it’s promised and value will come from those usages, and multiple added usages going forwards.
I say to those people either stay and stop moaning or leave and let other whales or people buy your crypto up.
May I add BTC will never be a global currency, there is no way governments will have something they can’t inflate or control.
But anyone who sells BTC today is a pure fool, because BTC price is so artificially manipulated low IMO for reasons of buying, it’s under valued.

Well you just said it, fiat cash “NO intrinsic value”, ahh but yet YOU use it, there is nothing saying people won’t be using crypto on mass that has no intrinsic value in the future, and we all know about faith. 
That is the most laughable part, but you wouldn’t understand.
“CEMENT” has an industrial utility also.
Bitcoin doesn’t listen about what a currency could be, or needs to be, it doesn’t care, it will be here or there in this form or that form, but it will be there.
If I look through history at all the people like you who talked from a book with no deviation the world would have stood still.
There is more news in crypto each day it is spreading.
Oh yes “AND IT HAS TO BE” could never be something else or buck a trend, because an economist said so haha.
That is a reference related to what money has too be.

Yes bitcoin is volatile, for me and many others that volatility has been one way UP, you work it out.
Oh and I didn’t say 1970s prices, I said 1970s value of fiat currency and their value today, there is a glaringly obvious POINT, that is that devaluation has taken away most of the value, this is hardly a good store of value like you claim, devaluation is volatility by rights.
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:43:11

Well no actually, you should take it as I can’t be bothered to argue or explain that finding bitcoins doesn’t always mean more wattage, as you seem to think it does.
Just to explain that to you if the hashing power is cut back the algorithm adjusts and is easier to crack, this doesn’t require more power in fact it requires less.
Plus your transactions per second stuff is complete nonsense as you can have many more TX per second without increasing wattage consumption.
Going forward the model doesn’t take into account any industries which BTC may take over or make redundant, in theoretical terms cutting power consumption elsewhere.
Renewables more effective mining equipment, and many many more, and all this on top of the fact that energy is paid for by the miners and that creates wealth elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:10:36
That’s totally confused me, because I always thought that one of the main reasons BTC price increases is because of adoption, and adoption can be seen by either higher network traffic, or lower network traffic less adoption?.
@_date: 2018-06-16 11:04:07
4 years stagnation haha, bitcoin traffic was through the roof dec 2017, yes it’s dropped way lower now, but how you figure 4 years is beyond me.
And like I’ve shown you why do you believe that BTC can’t work in the future, I don’t see why you think it’s a failed project, because that’s basically what your hinting. 
And in all fairness that’s laughable.
Must be all over then if it’s reversing haha.
I mean realistically do you really believe on the few statistics you’re talking about, that probably don’t take into consideration all and every aspect, do you really think all the people out there are wrong.
Because if you do you’re  way cleverer than everyone and somehow I doubt that on what you’ve said.
@_date: 2018-06-16 17:27:08
No go back, you said realising a profit or buying a property isn’t an investment, your exact words were,  “NO that’s not what investment mean”

Bet your in a corner cringing now haha.
@_date: 2018-06-16 11:44:28
But why would that matter even if that was the case today, it doesn’t mean it will always be the case?
You’ve got this weird view that only mast acceptance will pave the way for higher prices, when it’s not accurate.
BTC has usage even if people don’t know they are using it, meaning it could be incorporated or used as a payment rail by who or what ever company,  without the user even knowing they are using BTC.
This in return gives it everyday usage and value.
Personally I don’t care weather it is vastly adopted as business or corporations or other will find use cases for those tokens.
Also you don’t know or have a clue wheather the BTC price has purposely been manipulated down at the moment,
There have been many leave who were in it for short term gain, many have been burnt in the process.
Take also all the banning and regulation that wasn’t clear or in play at that time.
Also the tax implications ect.
We can see there are many reasons why transactions may be down, and many more we can’t see or don’t know.
That’s why I don’t see BTC as a done deal, far from it, there will be some factor that will spur an upward trajectory in time, and time we all have so don’t sweat be patient.

The dumps because the crypto space is full of juveniles that couldn’t afford to buy in the first place, hence they panic sell.

@_date: 2018-06-20 18:17:24
Arguments your arguing with yourself I think, personally I don’t care how much power bitcoin uses, I don’t care then, now or in the future, it’s boring.
Same as I don’t care how many coal powered power stations the Chinese erect monthly, or for that matter how many people leave their electrical goods on stand by, or how much power we drain daily off the world grid to charge our phone so that we can talk on talk forums and take selfies.
So not bothered or what ever.
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:48:50
I’m not talking or thinking of a system where only BTC or any other crypto exist, I don’t think that is possible but I do believe that there can be a co existence, the facts of the matter are societies need growth and if crypto including BTC can provide that growth or add to it then that’s a good thing right.
You say crypto is slow but for cross border payments that usually take 1 or 2 days under a system like swift seems crazy, as BTC can do that in 10 minutes and probably confirm within an hour.
Surely if this is the case it will increase money velocity and add value into the global economy.
But hey your a computer scientist and I may be wrong about those speeds.
I don’t have any answers about power consumption as I really don’t have any ideas, but if the money in time generated is more than the annual use surely this is ok.
I know that maybe won’t be for a number of years I admit.

The more BTC rises, eventually people will sell as everyone has a future price or profit they will be willing to sell at.
Eventually as the price goes up bitcoins won’t be affordable, you’ll only buy fractions of the Bitcoin.
It’s complete tosh saying no one will sell, they will,  and there will and are ready buyers waiting in the wings.

I find that bizarre that your willing to argue the fact as to money creation, as I sent you a link that clearly stated what I’m telling you to be fact.
Hey ho I will agree to disagree 
Yes I’m speculating for sure about “LN” I don’t have your technical know how, but I think anything can work in time, there may be trade offs I’m sure, probably ones that aren’t perfect.
But I think you’ll agree that as a payment rail that is fast and secure and promotes money velocity that must rationally add value.
Ultimately do or die, there is speculative money to be made in this space and I don’t believe we’ve even started seeing real price growth.
I would like your opinion though as you said there is beauty in Blockchains simplicity, yet Andreas said Blockchain isn’t anything special without a token, it is in fact no more than an insufficient data base.?
I get the token, miner reward and ultimately security.

Watched this earlier, goes to show how many cleaver people work for BLOCKSTREAM, BTC is programmable money and this along with TAP ROOT, GRAFT ROOT, BULLETPROOFS, and of course the LIGHTENING NETWORK, shows that you should never listen to NO COINERS of SHILLS that say BTC is broken or it can’t do this and it won’t be able to do that, as they haven’t a clue what BTC can do and are being proven wrong daily.
There isn’t any doubt this was one of Bitcoins major problems, and there is no doubt we all knew this, so maybe soon we will be moving into a new era for what BTC can do NOT WHAT IT CAN’T.������

Interesting, how will the power consumption go down, if adaption becomes greater, as I’m not savvy with power consumption but I would like to understand?
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:42:11
My guess is adoption will need to be way higher, “LN” may be this saviour, remember how fast the price will rise with higher transaction as we saw before.
FOMO kicks in real quick, and once you reach a point where the markets adoption spirals through the above, add in a halvening  (less coin) and those institutions will pay what ever the price is.
The reason for this is that there is no ideal price to buy BTC, if BTC works as a payment system store of value and currency these tokens will be worth million per coin.
Let’s just hope that the computer scientists can provide what BTC needs if they can institutions may well have too form a line to buy in.
Have faith we are satoshi.

But your views are your own and mine are mine, we are all entitled to them.

I think your lack of being able to comprehend is limiting your ability to understand hahaha��, as satoshi said if you don’t get it, I can’t be bothered to make you understand LOL.
You should read some books and find out what securities are first, if you did you would find as I pointed out CHIMERA “which means can take many form,so you understand this word “meaning  that BTC has elements which do make it a security,
FGS don’t get me explaining what a security is.
So if you can read and you clearly can’t, “refer back” you’ll see I said what ever compartment they do put BTC in it won’t be right as the rules need re writing as it can and does do all “CHIMERA”.
For that reason I said this will in one way or another stifle a branch of innovation, so please try not to be cleaver as you are clearly not.
SEC typical American authority that clearly cocks up the definition of a security in the first place, that said the Americans cock most things up in the world.

Wow how many times would the stock markets have died if a down trend meant imminent DOOM haha, it’s so funny hearing the same boring rhetoric.

Do you know at most 15% of gold produces goes into jewellery and technology?
The other 75% is stored in vaults, saying that the belief in gold prices comes from that reality is stupid.
It comes from the fact that the supply is capped by the mining companies and that it is a rare product, limited a store of value.
Bitcoins are less manipulated than gold and can do everything better, apart from the utility things you mentioned which you think gives gold value haha.

No I know why you fool, because they are saying it is more of a currency, yet again I am telling you that it’s highly debatable that BTC isn’t also a security as it’s a traded value.
What you miss “THICKO” is they have compartments and it either fits or doesn’t, and even if doesn’t fit they will push it in anyway.
I’m saying they need to re write their rule book for crypto currency.
As you’ll see they will call some securities and others not, yet when you look at those they probably do the same things, this is why it’s confused.
And I don’t give a shit who you are LOL.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:52:35
That’s not correct though, as bitcoin uses way less power than the banking system, oil exploration and gold and diamond mining.
Plus it will become more efficient over time, the problem with this silly article is its basing power consumption and the bitcoin network as something that is black and white, without taking into consideration all the other variables.
I would consider this pretty much pointless and in accurate.

That is a very well put point overall, especially as adoption may well follow price I’ve never thought of it that way, I know FOMO ect comes into play at some stage as well.
So In theory more people could be using BTC and we may not see a price rise, kinda making us think adoption isn’t taking place, when it could well be.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:41:24
Why would it be a funeral, most of this selling off is illogical, panic selling is for fools as selling something you have made a loss on and not holding in for better times is irrational.
IMO bitcoins are like futures, by this I mean their value rests on real world use, or should I say realist value for that use.
So if you can think or can see potential for BTC to solve a problem now or in the future through added software or programming then  you can think of a reasonable value for today.
As an example money velocity is one of the main things BTC can do better than traditional systems and more securely, probably not quite yet but it’s potential is there.
I think there are many people who own bitcoin for the simple reason they think they will become rich overnight, when they haven’t and the price drops they sell, simply because they couldn’t afford to buy them in the first place.
Please leave and don’t come back is my view.
But there is no funeral, if people can buy BTC for cheap prices they are the ones who will be laughing later, markets can turn in an instant.
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:15:51
That’s black and white isn’t it, kinda makes sense until you throw in the fact that no one knows they are buying bottom, because you only need slight bad news to drive bottom lower.
And transaction movement or adoption is key for price growth long term, so the more it’s used the higher the transaction volume will send the price up.
Really these people think they are needed more than they really are.
All helps of course, but on transactions alone BTC as a payment system can bring big money.
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:46:15
I was probably into BTC before you’d even heard of programmable money, for that reason you do your homework.
Anything that people say I have heard a million times, yet here BTC still stands.
I personally, and others I know have made large amounts from crypto in one way or another, and I would prefer to take notice of someone like Andreas antonopolous , or big money investors than the likes of people on reddit.
If you understood anything about what bitcoins potential is, you would see firstly that it’s capacity to enhance money “velocity”world wide must be up there with its best use cases, that increased money velocity can or should make bitcoins worth far more money, and this is without any other use cases that will eventually come into the global market.
The right regulation, will equal more expansion. 
Please read this link, you never know you may just get it, think of the $298 million transaction when you read it.
You should also note or read about transaction batching when you point out TX being lower than say December 2017, as this batching process can have a big impact on what may appear at first glance to be lower TX, but in reality doesn’t show the true figures, and this is only one reason, I’m sure some expert could explain way better than I.

If the miners shut down because the price becomes lower (scale back) does the network become less secure or does security adjust also, I mean would be network still be as secure but just smaller.?
And at the moment is the price break even or profitable, how low would BTC price have to drop to get to the scale back point.?

Just because the price drops you shouldn’t sell, hold it until the price rises up again.

 Because BTC only works because it’s decentralised, you see if people distrust centralisation  they are more likely to want change.
If institutions own all the BTC it’s centralised, everyone on here will cash out and walk away, waiting for the next phase.
Gold is useless, look at it seriously, BTC does virtually everything it can’t.
Gold for me is just THERE in the corner, NO MORE.
Irony of talking about bonds hahhaha, the bond markets are the biggest bubble that exists.
So the answer is not if “when.”
You see you’ve answered you own questions, all that is owned by centralised authority is a huge bubble waiting for a pin.
This is why they can’t own BTC, because if they do or can it goes south like all the other false profits they own ��.
Now you should understand what true value a deflationary token has, and what no value the centralised system has long term.

It’s the retailers that loose out big time, when such a global payment system goes down.
If retailers are tempted to use crypto in the future the channels that process crypto payments must not let the retailers down like this.

Ummm the problem you have with the pyramid analogy is that for the structure to be a pyramid scheme or ponzi as it’s true name is, you have to have an outright owner at the top controlling proceedings, you’d be well placed looking up Bernie mandorf as this was the biggest ponzi in history.
From this you’ll understand BTC can’t be by definition a Ponzi scheme and only a fool at this late stage would lay claim to such a comment,
What you mean is buying at the top of a market isn’t ideal, but selling lower than you bought out of panic is for fools, this has nothing to do with ponzi (pyramid schemes) just people who are generally investing what they can “afford to loose”.
From the link above you will see a Ponzi scheme is a fraud, where the promised investment never happens, who said that in BTC? 
No one is the answer because no one owns it, it’s a decentralised system.

Answering your first question, overstock.com prefer it to visa, and they don’t seem to have problems using it.
Plus any shop has to keep track of its sales receipts, even using fiat.
Second answer is TX per minute, scaling through “LN” and these things are happening now and being improved into the future.
@_date: 2018-06-18 16:20:08
Ok firstly failing or failed economic system is debatable and here’s why.
BANKRUPT a person or organisation that cannot pay their debts, so isn’t it the case that central banks create more liquidity ultimately to stave of bankruptcy, they do this to spur growth also in an economy but really it’s because they’re in the SHIT.?
Now as the saying goes lender of last resort, a central bank, “LAST RESORT” hey ho let’s not create more money out of accounting procedures and we can then watch our country go down the pan, as this is what would happen.
So they do create more and promise they will pay it back, I mean the uk, America and Europe, problem is they don’t pay it back they kick that can down the road until next time.
Like “LN” you’re sceptical but you’re not saying it won’t work or evolve into a super global, fast, secure payment network that dwarfs all other that came before, WHY because no one knows, but it could than what is BTC useless and has no economic return?
Yet you know and I do and so does everyone else that BTC’s network is strong and fraud resistant, that alone should be praised not debated.
I have read two articles on power consumption, one was that gold proponents said it uses more than gold, this wasn’t true, as gold mining over all used lots more barrel of oil equivalent over the whole process.
Store of value I know you’ll say it’s terrible ( well in true sense or the word STORE OF VALUE, kinda put in £1000 today and get out £1000 in ten years or a years time, fine we get that, but BTC is good depending upon when you get in, or long term like Andreas said.
I certainly agree humans are greedy, the greediest being those in charge of the current monetary system, as they can and do manipulate to their advantage.
Oh and I’m not saying crypto isn’t manipulated, it’s just not by them.
And I don’t get your pay international transfers with fiat, here’s why if you pay with a slow antiquated system, that will do nothing to speed money velocity, if we globally speed up money velocity we create wealth, that instrument that can preform that or that token should then or will rise in value, because it’s useful and creating wealth.
Oh and not only quick but for anyone who does take part, knows that transfer is 1000% secure and some.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:35:56
Thank for the that, I’m still digesting it, I find LN harder to understand than bitcoin, but thar has helped a lot.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:22:52
Bitcoins are worthless unless they can do something, it’s the technology that exists now or the tech that is added that makes BTC more adaptable, if you realise this then value will be added.

So am I right in thinking, that if the network ran on lesser amount of hashing power, this is possible because the algorithm would adjust down?
And visa Versa if hashing power was increased (algorithm adjusts up).
The formers trade off being a less secure network as hashing power secures the network.and the more hashing power  the miners implement the more secure the Blockchain.???
Adoption isn’t  really a result of either, really this is only to confirm network transactions either way.?
@_date: 2018-06-15 21:42:31
In fairness it doesn’t need stability short term as if the shop owner or individual can get fiat price at the time of sale this eradicates that volatility.

I think he means because it’s deflationary, agreed it’s not a good store of value unless the price is always higher that you paid, in the latter case anyone who’s in profit could argue that their value is fine and stored haha.

Blockchain doesn’t matter, it’s nothing but a data base without BTC token or other token.

Clearly it isn’t, so that tells me what ever you think isn’t worth my time.

The miners walk away, who secured the network then, the incentive is decentralisation.
What you mean like banks say I know we will adapt Blockchain without a token ��,
See you can’t own BTC.
In fact you pay just like everyone else and that should be the way, and will be the way and is the way.

Regulation like what they propose stifles innovation, it has been clear for along while BTC doesn’t fit in one of their little compartments as it is a chimera.
For this reason they should change the rules, when you change those rules, you also let innovation that may come from those rule changes flow, that in turn created economic growth.
If you put something into a compartment where it shouldn’t be you do they opposite and strangle what it can do or could be, this is what would be deemed as stifling innovation.

@_date: 2018-06-15 18:21:06
Virtually all you’ve said is what I had already told you, please read between lines, all a country does by increasing the money supply is cause long term debt, that as you point out they sell.
Debt just the same, which is a stealth tax and a debasement of the money supply.
And” NO you said Japan had more public debt your words,” I said no it doesn’t, it may have double debt to gdp, but that’s not what you said.
You really have faith in the US dollar, it’s butt fudge and countries want away from it, China for one.
A ticking bomb.
Think you should educate yourself on debasement and also then you may see that eventually the more funds you falsely create the less the dollar is worth, until the point it’s worthless.
So you clearly are clueless 
Oh and your comment about them selling debt”well you knew clearly what I meant by that analogy, but I will put it another way for you, anything that they create that they don’t have or isn’t backed by value is DEBT PERIOD.
This is why they had a gold standard.
Probably when you’ve read the link I sent, you’ll be able to go back and look at the comment that started this conversation, remember you said the USA knows how to handle money unlike other countries well the link above proves you talking SHIT. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:21:18
Oh it’s deniable haha, do you know how much debt the US has and logically as I pointed out Europe, your clearly insane or financially un educated to believe that a system like exists in those western countries isn’t on the same path as the former.
Just sounded like a way of statement that the west manages money better, bond buying credit ect ect.
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:27:39
No I didn’t say that’s all central banks do, I know they do much more than that, but I believe it has been and will continue to be a cycle of boom and bust.
No one will Change my mind on this as I’ve seen this cycle throughout my life, the only thing I haven’t witnessed it a mother of all crashes.
I kind of see the issue with LN I think I’ve heard something similar before and I’ve heard of hubs also, I’m not technical enough to truly know what if anything could or can be done there.
I don’t see the problem with looking at anything as an investment vehicle, if I can make money from it I will, ideally most things to do with money and investing is so we can have more than we started with.
There is an irony in what you’ve said, you stand up in part for the banking system, yet you feel for a few who may hold an empty bag over BTC speculation (a sympathy).
Yet the system you stand by rapes people for the good of the rich and the bankers, as it’s always at the cost of the tax payer.
But it’s been interesting and we can agree to disagree that’s ultimately what I think we do.

@_date: 2018-06-24 19:21:40
Well firstly you don’t understand money velocity, it’s not about how many bitcoins there are, it’s about how fast and efficient you as an economy can move money, this believe it or not creates more wealth, from this you can calculate a reasonable price for a bitcoin if it can add value in said economic structure.
It may be a weird futures analogy but you are investing in future tech, BTC isn’t worth $300 because if it was it would be $300 dollars today and it’s clearly not.
How exactly do you fathom if money velocity increases there will be more bitcoins?
They are devisable, I can sent millions by using just one token��
Oh and they aren’t buying two times the amount of tokens back, the price is dropping not by that amount, they are selling and then wondering or regretting they have, and that’s because people are sucking up their cheap tokens.
Oh and without the FUD $300 dollar scenario you put forward, the market works by people buying up those cheap coins the fools sell, and they have always bought up thousands above the $300 dollar price you talk of, if you watch carefully you’ll see and it’s not difficult to spot as the price will rise haha.

Where have you got your statistic from for the 99% can you post a link?
In fact I’ve done a google search on adoption and that’s barely proof, as for everyone that say increasing there is one that will say decreasing urrrrrrr, that’s not proof, as who do you believe?
And like I said barely 0 statistics that say no, why don’t you do your own google search and find out?
And yes I do believe that they will be wrong, I did give you reasons why BTC can still be viable even without public adoption, but I find you selective in what you’re replying too, meaning you don’t have the all the answers.
Funny really selective correspondence.

I agree these seed storage devices aren’t going to burn in a fire or get damaged by water, top product.
The only problem I had with them is the 24 seed words would not fit on just one device, I had to use other spaces on a second one, maybe because some seed words were longer than usual.

Maybe that’s correct, but that’s not the end of BTC or other.
At the end of the day people have the choice as they can use it or not use it, if they choose the latter and many will, there may not be mast adoption by choice.
If the above is the case then the capitalists will buy it all up and use and find used for it, and people will use it in one form or another without even knowing, truth is either way Crypto and BTC have use cases and they are here to stay, over time their value will rise but no one knows how much as it’s guess work.
Another thing you said in one of your posts was cash is cheaper to use than BTC, I agree it is, but it’s splitting hairs for the sake of it IMO.
If the network fees are ultra low and eventually they will be, crypto payments for me beat carrying dirty cash around.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:15:08

BTC doesn’t need to keep them out, but they will never own BTC.
The power is in the decentralised system, not long ago they said BTC was nothing, fantasy, beanie babies, now they want in at the lowest rate possible ��.
It won’t work like that because BTC burns everyone, we all say shit I wish I’d bought or I wish I’d sold then, so will they, personally I think BTCs true value is around 5k uk, we are bottom now so they should buy, and so should everyone else.
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:28:40
I didn’t say store of value, that’s also debatable as it depends on the price you buy at and the future price, I’m personally finding it a huge store of value from at what price I payed for it, as I said debatable as it would need to drop way more than 50% for me to be out of pocket.
And payment rail is what I meant, any payment company could buy up BTC and use it and it’s network globally, and it would have use case and value, any financial institution could buy all the bitcoins in existence and use them for their own ends.
That is facilitating trade.

Investment, the action or process of investing money for future profit.
When you buy a property you don’t buy because you think the property will go down in value, you buy because it will go up. 
Can’t you comprehend that by definition you’ve made an investment are you illiterate also, because you don’t understand investment in its basic terms.
All the people here with me now all agree and are laughing at you, because they can’t grasp why you don’t think a property is an investment.

That’s utter rubbish, they will just mine other coins, there are more coins to mine than just BTC, if that’s all they are waiting for they will be disappointed.
The cost of a bitcoin has many other factors, you are talking like it’s black and white.
You seem to have this idea that BTC needs those investors, but what BTC needs only is public adoption, that will come in time FOMO.
Think they are more awaiting clarity on regulation, detail of that regulation.
Nice try though thinking that you have a magic formula for buying cheap BTC.
The proof your theory isn’t correct is that the hash-rate has dropped too that point before, yet we haven’t seen this huge influx of institutional money.
For the reasons above I think is not correct at all.
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:13:50
As I said you are selective in what you choose in answering, as I noticed you did comment on the proposal I put forward that BTC would have value even without mast adoption, I believe you are sensible enough to know there are many powerful and wealthy people who could turn BTC into future profit like I said without the public.
Oh and I don’t need people to make me into a millionaire, I never said I was waiting for that, I made a five figure sum uk before Xmas 2017 and I know there is more in the future.

Well it’s there now and so is the network, that’s why it’s used now, that’s why they aren’t doing what you are implying they could, BTC network is proven secure and all is in place.
And aren’t they implementing software soon that gives transaction that anonymity, I think they are, any way software can be implemented into BTC without creating and setting up a whole new network.
Store of values meaning means nothing to me, all I know is I’m not losing money so it’s keeping value for me, note I didn’t use the word store.
But hey ho, I don’t think you’ve convinced me of anything, in fact I’m more convinced than ever.

I think the point really is that economists arguably do understand money more for sure, but how is the financial system of the world in such bad shape, and keyed more towards those that have money than those that don’t.
You would think in the respect of people who fight their corner they would be worthy of that because they produce stability and fairness and equality, they don’t though and they have never, they can hardly agree in bad times the best fixes for the problems.
I doubt they do understand BTC and it’s system because most that aren’t tech don’t.

There is a total cap because it is a deflationary token, meaning a fixed supply over a period of time that cannot be manipulated or inflated, this secures it value as deflationary tokens will hold their value or go up in value over time.
Fiat currency is inflationary which means central banks create more for projects or bail outs, when they create more they debase (de value) the notes and coins already in circulation, meaning you and I become poorer through inflation.
This system they use is fractional reserve banking and no matter what anyone tells you, sooner or later all those currencies die through hyper inflation.
As this other person said BTC is devisable by 100 million places, so you can buy a fraction of the bitcoin and use it or hodl it.
So buy now haha.
Not sure what you mean by accumulate more, some tokens are created all in one go or at the start, if you create large amounts, there is little supply and demand and supply and demand or shortage pushes up the price or value.
Coins that have billions in supply aren’t going to make big money as they are common and over supplied.
Mining costs alone don’t dictate the price of a token, there are many aspects that dictate the price, usage and adoption would be top of the list and institutional money also that invests into BTC should mean higher prices for tokens.
Rare painting fetch large prices because they are rare, 21 million bitcoins and 8 billion people, this makes Bitcoins rare.

No the post was about institutional money waiting too buy in when the miners no longer’ or are on the verge of breaking even or even losing money, he said this is bottom of the market.
I said that’s happened before and they didn’t buy in on mass, so the theory is lame at best.
I said BTC doesn’t need institution money, it has other options like a global payment rail for one, just this one thing brings big money.
There are a lot of people in the BTC community that don’t care about institutional money coming in, there more interested in the tech for the other purposes set out above.
Usually these institutions have sock puppets on reddit ect, for the reason of pushing their wares, and you can tell who they are SOCK PUPPETS.
And as for my debt remark all of those markets are based on debt and bubbles.
Every one without exception, because all of the so called wealth is based on the dollar, which is the biggest bubble of them all, why you don’t get this is beyond me.
Don’t think institutional money is always a good thing as they tend to fuck things up in the end.
I’m not anti that or this, but I mean BTC or crypto doesn’t need them.

You’re  wrong the European central banks creates that money and divides it out to the banks around Europe, the trick is in the name lender of last resort, this is the same true of the federal reserve bank.
Next is a cop out,  I could answer the question better for you in this way, I’m sure there are more computer scientists that would argue or tell you that it will work and be able to tell you why.
From this IMO BTC is a long way from dead in fact I think it’s got more chance now than ever before.
And it has high numbers of miners now and it has the computing power,  but I’d like to know what would change that so that this attack could take place?.
I mean it’s kinda WHAT IF and we could do WHAT IFS all day long.
If you read you will see the ECB stands for European Central Bank, it clearly stated that the ECB prints the money or creates it through quantitative easing then distributed that money around the Eurozone banks.
You will find this policy the same for all central banks, this yet again is why they are called the LENDER OF LAST RESORT.
So Andreas is clearly not an economist as he stated and clearly neither are you.
Also if you read that link you will find an interesting part about inflation and deflation, but let’s focus on inflation because creating more money causes inflation, which devalues all and everything, call it an added tax on the poor.
The problem is can you always control this inflation or will it turn into hyperinflation, if the latter rears its head, they the central bank create more money through quantitative easing, making more inflation and then its end game.
BUT THIS COULD NEVER happen of course, but this is one reason that BTC was created as it can’t be inflated to the point of worthlessness and economic chaos that comes from the above economic system.
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:53:22

You can buy bitcoin at 100k and still make a profit long term, anyone who doesn’t understand being long on bitcoin, doesn’t understand why satoshi made them so devisable.
You buy any time, just it’s more for-filling buying when there is a downtrend.
People who bought at 20k should hodl and ride the market and then they will not be at a loss, in time.
The whole point is “BUYING “any amount from a few dollars to any amount you can afford.

That’s because they don’t understand BTC, it’s bollocks about when you buy, as no one knows what is dear or what is cheap.
Example is most people on here say they believe BTC could be worth 100,000 let’s say, so why do they panic if the price goes lower than when they bought it?
The point is you have to be long on the price, oh and don’t listen to price predictions they are idiots who predict and idiots who listen, look at what it can do now and going forward and think how much you believe its value could be.
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:47:21
So does gold mining and all that goes into gold mining, or like the article states about the banking system at present, use way more power overall that mining crypto?

@_date: 2018-06-13 14:03:36
But you can hold any amount and still be in the position your talking about, I mean I’d say 1 satoshi is worth 1 dollar, just one BTC would be worth 100 million.
If you have the money to buy why not buy now instead of waiting.

Why would you need to integrate them, what’s the advantage.?
I’m not seeing that it’s easy though what you’ve said, is it easy for someone who has no experience “NO” is the answer, so for a crypto to succeed it needs to be easy, or what’s the point.

It’s the Bitcoins that make Blockchain interesting, one with the other works for certain reasons, one without the other doesn’t.

It is higher by many times, even when people talk of a crash from 2017 levels, BTC is still very much in profit, just not enough to start people spending, they are still inclined to buy and hold rather than spend.
I see it as kinda like having an extension on your house, and selling the house before the extension has given you all the benefits of the extra space.
The BTC ecosystem is growing through software and ideas. And the token that makes these ideas work is capped at 21

BTC started at 0 now it’s £6’250, it doubles each year, is deflationary and exempt for inflation, because it has a limited supply of 21 million coins, and those coins are divisible by 100 million places, over the long term it will only go higher, there is your financial advise.
And the main point is you can buy as little as £5 worth, you do not need to buy a whole coin.
Go out and ask how many Brit’s know what Interest rate they are paying on their mortgages and you’ll get the same kinda results, also you’ll find brits will buy houses no matter how much they go up or how big the housing markets bubble is or becomes, it’s the same scenario except the housing market is encouraged so you’re enslaved to the banks and the government gets its cut.
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:24:37
I’m not sure there is a next hype wave, I think that BTC is moving more in the direction of usability, take a look at the new bitfi wallet.
And also all the hard work blockstream  are doing and also lightening payments, all of the above should clearly have a big impact on the price.
But that said institutional money will no doubt be the overnight game changer on BTC price, and i believe people who own BTC will no doubt be more liable to spend their funds.
I am convinced that higher prices will spur more spending.
@_date: 2018-07-01 12:21:48
No your young and clearly naive, you don’t own your house you just believe you do because it says your name on the deeds, but if you miss some payments who comes and takes your house off you?
Ahh yes the bank who lent you the money, this is why you never own a house until you’ve payed it off, you’re paying rent in a roundabout way.
I’m late 50s I have payed for a 1.2 million pound property in Yorkshire, I have two rental properties and all those rules applied to me as I was buying, they also apply to my son and daughter now they have their own houses.
You own nothing until it’s payed off.
Plus your pay many times over what your house is worth in interest over the term of your mortgage.
And a friend of ours son who owned BTC payed cash for his house at 21 years old, no mortgage as he cashed out dec 2017, BTC will hit those highs again and that’s why I would tell a millennial to invest and hold bitcoins.

@_date: 2018-07-18 16:51:10
I have a question and it’s something I don’t understand, firstly I understand a “Ledger nano s “ stores the private key on a chip on the device ok, and I understand that you access you’re  nano through google chrome app, what I don’t understand is how is that app not connected to the internet, or is it, and only the nano is not connected because it uses a USB?
So can’t malware get into the chrome app, and steal you’re  private key in anyway?
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:49:23
IMO the fastest route to price growth, is firstly “clear regulation”, followed by an influx of institutional money.
Once the above happens the price of a Bitcoin will increase dramatically and that will put bitcoin back in the news, public interest should grow through FOMO and there should be a point when BTC price velocity just takes off.
I think basically this is the model satoshi thought would happen or could happen.
Everything else like software upgrades, “LN” payment network and more user friendly wallets and anything else that is in the planning stage, will of course have added benefit and value.
But we are just not there yet so patience is what we all need, it is coming.

No bank will create its own digital currency.
1. They don’t have a secure Blockchain that is open, as it can’t be open if it’s centralised.

I didn’t say you couldn’t I said they’d be better investing in BTC and buying with their profits longer term.
Oh and you haven’t bought a house, you are renting it off the bank that loaned you the money, you only have bought and own a house when you’ve payed it off.
And you clearly live somewhere north of London or you wouldn’t have bought because wages aren’t enough to buy.
IMO owning houses in the U.K. isn’t the be all and end all.
Millennials should fight back at authority that put them on low wages, and that have let house prices get out of control, by not buying and investing that money into crypto.
I mean you would have to be living at home but if that’s possible why have the stress of an over valued house and mortgage.

If you want to talk about global warming like some do, I suggest any one who argues against “BITCOINS MINING” or any other mining process first goes and takes a look at the biggest polluter on the planet, “BEEF AND CATTLE INDUSTRY”.
Where you will find this industry pollutes more than everything else literally that we use including cars combined.
Any one who does “NOT “consume meat, has the right to argue, any one who “DOES”consume and props up that industry doesn’t have the right to argue against “BTC mining”, ask yourself a simple question do I eat meat.
So why hasn’t the beef and cattle industry been banned?
SIMPLE it’s too big to ban, there are so many people in Congress and other industries who financially benefit from beef farming, economies rely on that money.
But morally let’s see, Animal abuses, people being executed for speaking out against big beef producers, even cancer research institutions receiving money from the beef industry to keep a lid on them peddling one of the main causes of human cancers and heart disease “you guessed it MEAT.
So without further ado check out this polluting cancer causing money greed industry, and you’ll truly see how mis conceived all arguments about any mining of any materials are compared, *YET I SEE OR HEAR NO PROTESTS FROM THE MASSES ��*.
So I think we ought to compare it to the beef and cattle industry and not gold or visa.

I know the Philippines and I’ve had to do with their banks as a westerner, not had any major issues as such, but as a Filipino I know it’s like you say it is.
If crypto works for certain people that’s great and I hope it does, but you know like I do that if you only earn dollars a day there isn’t much left if any after rent, food, water, so any accounts only really work if you have spare money to fund them.
I know people in the west that live month to month pay check, they don’t have spare cash for buying crypto.

Why everyone thinks  a BTC “ETF” is so special is beyond me.
If you can’t see that even if they grant one, which they never will, they would crash BTCs price down the instant any fraud or manipulation was committed, they would do this by revoking those licences.
“What they give they can take away”, it will end badly because bitcoin is borderless, meaning you can’t truly regulate it.
No matter what anyone says all the promises they make, there will be fraud and manipulation in Bitcoin because it’s fuelled by greed only.
There is no libertarianism any more and the dream of a peer to peer cash system cannot work with these institutions involved, It’s creator would be horrified.
@_date: 2018-07-05 07:54:23
I can’t comment on the risk, but you could have said that about a ledger nano or a tezor or any other wallet that has come to market.
I think the point you are missing is the bitfi wallet is better if you read, it’s hack proof and easier to use, it’s designed for making mass adoption for non tech people easy.
The facts are about all hardware wallets in the market at present is they are hassle and not secure, as soon as you start explaining about master seeds people walk away, as there is way more risk involved, bitfi has got over this with an easy to remember 5 word brain seed.
@_date: 2018-07-29 11:56:21
There is no point what so ever in passing licences for ETFs while there are chances of fraud or manipulation.
Wait until these things are banished from this market and then it will be viable, but granting a licence that potentially can be revoked a short way down the line would cause more harm to BTC than good.
Investors want security and a level playing field, not the Wild West of investing.

You will find most markets rely on someone else buying, the housing market is a typical example, this isn’t a flaw it more a sign of a buoyant market when people are still buying in.
There are other issues at play regarding the price also, don’t be under the illusion that the price is all based upon buyer demand, innovation also has an effect on market prices.

It’s not that I’m uncomfortable with it, it’s that bitfi wallet has made that 24 word seed redundant, they have achieved this with a 5 word seed of your own choosing which you can remember rather than write down, or do both if that’s what you are comfortable with.
So let’s think about it for mast adoption would the dumb public choose “hassle 24 word seed, remember you only have to write one word incorrect or miss one, or a simple 5 word phrase.
IMO it must be the latter, because the former isn’t what a non tech person will want to trust their saving too.
No more crypto steels, bank vaults ect....
Just a simple brain wallet seed.

I would say that there is far more chance of said price going much higher indeed, but alas nothing is written in stone, loans on something that may be if that’s which way you want to go is fine, but i think patience is safer.
BTC wasn’t designed for this, this is all like traditional financing markets, their Moto is why wait till tomorrow to have what you can have today.
Now take a look at society and you’ll see this is how it is, banks debts and misery, but most of all uncertainty.
Loans don’t always work with sensible lending, if they did no one would be bankrupt, it encourages spending you don’t or haven’t got.
Be patient hodl you’re tokens and be the bearer of financial happy days in time, all good things come to he who waits.
This is just some company wanting to make a fast buck.

I think you understanding of bitcoin is probably on the lowest par I’ve seen in a long while, also you and your friends don’t make any difference to the total outcome you are deluded.
An example is low wattage LED lighting, research has proven that if there is an energy saving device, humans just use more of them, there is no energy saved over time or overall.
You also forget that the energy used by BTC would get used anyway, and your thoughts on petrol cars is ludicrous, as even with battery power the energy has to come from somewhere. 
Gold mining uses multiple times more energy than BTC in oil barrels per year, do your research before you speak.

From what I understand from speaking with US citizens and Canadians, their banks are far more controlling than those in Europe.
Example being in U.K. a debit card is basically plastic cash, you’re own money Its debited from your account balance, so no one has any right to either restrict or tell you what you can or cannot spend you’re own money on.
And in the U.K. I’ve not heard of debit card payments being stopped, and rightly and morally so.
I was told by a Canadian that Canadian banks don’t allow crypto buying with debit cards, I think they are insulting their civil liberties, and imo they should be protesting on the streets and outside parliament, as it’s getting very close to communism.
But they don’t protest they just take it year in year out.��

Bitcoin is meant to be decentralised, it shouldn’t and it’s price shouldn’t be manipulated by news from the SEC, BANKS or GOVERNMENT, by applying for these licences you’re turning BTC into a centralised system in effect giving those institutional people power over its price.
This guys post is correct, BTC price should be spurred by adoption outside of the government controlled financial sector of old.
This is how the white paper set out expansion, not by begging for licences, the real way was and still is the best way, keep them out until they beg to come in.

They have little idea of what an ETF means, and like I’ve pointed out it could cause bitcoin lots of damage, because you’re selling something as secure to investors that isn’t and never will be, because there are too many greedy people in it now.

I don’t have any connection to any of the companies , I just find it a ridiculous exercise, anyone can create a test to destroy something or test it way past what would be needed.
The point is does this make it a “good test” or a “bad example of how not to run a test”? I believe the latter.
Bearing in mind a normal house fire isn’t direct heat immediately it builds up over a period of time, and to a max of 1100 degrees Fahrenheit, Steel will easily take this kind of heat period.
A crematorium burner runs at about 1800 degrees Fahrenheit, this guy has used 2500 degrees direct heat.
Now think about what I’ve said and what would be needed to run a test that would pass a European kite mark, I assure you his would be ruled out because there is no need to take it  that far.
It could hurt those peoples businesses for sure, unless he has a plan to dissuade people from using them, because he himself has a plan to bring something to market as a competitor.
It’s just a crazy test.
All of the things tested would stand up to normal conditions.
“Yeah drop one into the sun”, or in a “nuclear test site” in case the world ends and there is a nuclear winter blah blah blah, “BUT then we all wake up and realise this is all pointless”, so you see my meaning.
I see most of the people on here with lame views as fantasists, bitcoin and it’s ecosystem didn’t used to be like this, because of these people I worry for bitcoin, I mean look at the down votes I’ve received for pointing out the obvious flaws, it’s truly ridiculous.
Let me give you another analogy of a test, let’s take a mouse trap, that trap only has to exert a certain amount of pressure onto said mouses bones in its neck, I don’t have need to test it or make it so strong a mechanism that I could break the neck of an elephant.
Do you see it would be a stupid waste of time resource and effort.
Or an oxyacetylene torch that can burn at 6300 degrees Fahrenheit, and you keep said crypto steel in a safe, if I cut into your safe with said torch it may melt your crypto steel, so any crypto steel that can’t stand this 6300 degree Fahrenheit temperature must not be trusted just in case that situation arises.

Bitcoin and it’s tech is decades in advance of anything the world has seen, this in part is why people don’t get it, I mean the general public, but it’s so important and people in government know this is the future of some finance.
I would take an educated guess, and say I believe the ETF is fundamental for bitcoins financial rise, I believe that institutional money would come in quicker and easier, once this happens and BTC is 10s of thousands, the public herds will be buying in, even the no coiners who say they never would, because once you reach a terminal price velocity it will moon.
The problem is whether the financial markets can handle the amount of cash that will be being pumped in as the price goes higher and higher so will the pumping in of fiat.
This is what they know and are scared of because nobody really knows what the final outcome will be.
The price can latterly act like a run away train and IMO it’s coming.

Basic supply and demand.
If the supply for bitcoins is high, and you cut the amount produced the price will go up.
If the demand isn’t there then the price won’t go up, it could even go down.
But LONG TERM and IMO this is where people go wrong with bitcoin, long term those halvenings  will effect supply and will benefit price rises, as long term more people should enter the space.

@_date: 2018-07-21 14:14:59
I think you’re kinda mixed up and not seeing the big picture, you may be right about the lending and loan side of a banks business of course it’s how they make money and enslave the masses, the only point you clearly miss is that accumulating assets is fine as long as the currency you’ve accumulated those assets in keeps its value.
What do you think happens to all those assets linked to fiat if that fiat goes to zero, that’s right they become worthless also, or near impossible to sell.
It’s not bank hating it’s pointing out at last the system is broken and they the banks can’t be trusted.
In the main the article is correct, but the main reason banks want a cashless society is to stop the public doing a bank run for their money, where as if it is all online digital transfer they can take the site down and stop you dead and keep you’re money in their coffers.
It’s all in preparation for that coming event, this is also why banks can’t have open Blockchain or digital tokens, as it would make it easy for all their customers to transfer their funds, leaving the bank bankrupt.
Be under no illusion banks that have stopped withdrawals in the past only survived bankruptcy because they refused to let clients have their own money.
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:42:45
So your taking a loan based purely on the fact that BTC will rise in value of the amount of the loan you have taken and then you pay it off with that profit.
Small question what if said loaner wakes up in the morning and the BTC price is 500 dollars, and they’ve had a loan of 10 thousand dollars, as that’s what the value of their BTC holding were before the crash?
Usually in imo if your not playing with you’re own money it equals debt.

It goes onto the debt clock, ultimately what ever you create has to be paid back at some point.
We all know they can’t pay it back that’s why they keep subsidising things with more, and that’s fine while they can keep interest rates low.
But once market forces push interest rates up and their money printing isn’t working any more, the end game could be closer than ever.
And if you look at history this is usually what occurs at some point, when you rely on a never ending train of QE to stimulate economic growth.

I can tell you exactly how BTCs price will go, the same way as satoshi said it would, why people forget this is strange.
Firstly BTC was a bubble at 20k due to tether and trading, not a stable enough price for long enough, this is why it crashed or corrected.
An ETF could just spur the price to where it needs to be to get the public interested, GOLD went from $320 to $1800 dollars when it’s ETF was launched 10 years ago, if this happens to bitcoin that would make BTC worth about $35k each.
That figure would hit the mainstream news and would be all over social media, this is the point where FOMO would kick in and the price would climb higher IMO.
This was how satoshi envisaged the latter part, also you will find the higher the price goes the more liquidity is in the market, this should stabilise some of BTC volatility , meaning it would be harder to crash.
My only concern would be that the network can handle that buying volume, but at some point terminal velocity through new buyers will put BTC on a course for world dominance, in theory the latter could happen.
But I assure you the temptation to make easy money will sway the herd, as it’s “money and we all need it.”
Satoshi was cleaver indeed.
The only reason it hasn’t happened yet is the price hasn’t been news grabbing for long enough, and over shadowed by the crash.
And in theory the governments of the world will have shot them selves in the foot, because wages are suppressed for the masses, the draw of easy money will kill them and make BTC king.
You also have to keep in mind all the other things that can add value to BTC, and there are many from tech innovation through to taking percentages of trade from other markets.
BTC will win, hang on in.

There are so many posts on reddit claiming banks in the US and Canada randomly close or suspend bank accounts for minor reasons, you’d think you’d see street protests on the news over these issues.
The reasons you don’t is because combined the people are strong and can protest and make change, but individually they are greedy and weak and lazy, the latter is why you don’t see change.

You don’t understand deflation clearly, this is for you especially, “LONG TERM”
Deflationary BTC will only go up in value, this is based on its limited supply.
There are no losers long term, the only loser is an investor that panic sells due to a price drop, you always hold until the market changes and an up swing in price occurs this puts you back in profit.
If a BTC token is 50k and it rises to 75k you have made 25k profit easy.
But if you pay 50k and the price drops by 25k yes you are 25k down short term, if you hold the price will rise.
Sell and that’s when you lose 25k.
Most people that have lost just don’t get how to play this market.

Beef farming is way worse than all cars.
The point was people haven’t got a clue when they talk about mining power use.
It takes 1’800 gallons of water to create one pound of beef, that is shocking, that’s not without the energy needed.
Over 51 % of global energy is used directly or indirectly farming beef.
It take 284 gallons of oil to raise a 1,250 lb cow for slaughter.
The United States slaughters over 25 million per year, that’s “355 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL “ for cattle production and processing alone.

Elaborate more.
You mean you don’t like the amount of energy needed to keep the network secure through proof of work?
You believe that there is a better way like proof of stake ect....
But I was talking in my description about the price, not the power consumption or proof of work, which for the record is the best was to secure a network bar none.
In fact I can prove that part of what I have said is correct, it’s the part that hasn’t happened yet and this is how it goes.
Put 1000 people in a room and tell them to go to a certain address or addresses as when they get there they’ll be given free money, all of those people “ALL” will head off to those addresses, no one refuses making easy money.
Now when bitcoins are 50k or less and rising you bet your bottom dollar the crowd will follow, through FOMO just like satoshi predicted and this in turn will push the price higher.
Proof of work in the eyes of most of the worlds top computer scientists including Nick Szabo is for sure worth the electricity costs as when you truly understand the network effect on the economy, you realise it’s future cost and money saving aspects make it worth while and that’s without the savings it can make by taking away electric costs say from gold mining as now people who once bought gold now buy coin.
You know the biggest irony when you talk about power consumption, is that to have a truly secure network where people will leave fortunes on it, you need hashing power and the electric to make that happen, try to take short cuts because you think it’s secure and cheaper and you’ll be doomed.
BTCs Blockchain is unbreakable because it consumes.

This statement is rubbish as gold would have to match the price of all the fiat in existence “meaning each ounce of gold would need to be at least 10’000 USD” if that was to happens it would cause hyper inflation or very near, this is why it will never happen and why it “GOLD” cannot work.
BITCOIN can mathematically and on the value side needed, schiff is too dumb to know the truth.

I cannot for the life of me, understand why people still argue that gold is better than BTC.
Satoshi gave the world an opportunity to develop financial thinking and wealth storage.
Gold may have been around for thousands of years, but this doesn’t mean that something that is better can never come along, because if you are awake to technology you can see it already has (BTC).
We can with BTC move huge amounts of wealth across borders instantly, gold has never been able to do this and never will.
In most cases gold isn’t you’re own, third parties will be the keepers and store it for you.
Gold audits some times show the gold isn’t even there.
It can also be “FAKED”.
You could argue BTC is more volatile, but we all should know that with a more liquid future market the price volatility will be tamed, this is hardly an excuse to say gold is better.
If all gold was replaced by BTC then we could offset the total energy consumption of gold mining (in Barrels of oil per yer) against that of BTC mining in barrel of oil, leading to a huge saving.
We need gold and it has its place but logic should show that digital code with value is far superior.
You will get the gold bugs arguing for gold against BTC, the simple reason is they don’t understand just how important a revolution BITCOIN is yet, I assure anyone that the strongest and most influential changes always win in the long term, BTC will take at least 40% of the gold market over the next 15 years.

I think your looking at it short term like most people do, think of all you’ve said now over many years, people will be introduced by friends or family to crypto and if the wallets become easier and less hassle, maybe people will prefer using crypto eventually.
You’ll be surprised once people get used to a system they’re less likely to change, that’s why they use traditional money at present basically because they are programmed for using it.
Plastic cards are doing away with fiat money everyday, when you realise plastic is easier you naturally move over to using just plastic, Bitcoin can do what plastic can more securely and without the middle man.
So it does have the chance for replacing fiat, I wouldn’t under estimate its draw, especially when it’s made easier and its value increases.

You are all stupid, all people are interested in is the greed, making fast money.
An ETF is the worst thing that can happen to BTC, in the longer term it will kill it, and here is why.
Granting an ETF for something that’s highly manipulated, has little security off the open blockchain, is only held by a tiny amount of people.
So if an ETF is approved you will see a huge price spike, but within 2 years the market will commit fraud, the SEC will take back their licences, the BTC price will crash faster than any other time in history, panic selling on a scale never seen until BTC is worth $10 max.
And human greed and deceit will be its downfall 
Please give us an ETF I promise we will “BE GOOD”, apart from the fact that BTC is borderless and no one can make all the others behave, if you can’t see why this would be a disaster and why they have turned this down you’re stupid.
It will KILL BTC not make it.

Cause you’re in control of your own destiny.
Wouldn’t say comparing your economy with Japan’s proves longevity, but if that’s what makes you sleep well hey ho.
And of course there can never be other market forces that force a country to push up interest rates, I mean Argentina was the richest country at one point and look what happened there.
But if the fed set their own rates and America is immune to market forces from elsewhere in the world, maybe you should get a noble prize for showing everyone how an economy can become bullet proofed like you’ve said and shown ����.
Being under the uneducated banner of thinking a central bank can keep interest rates low forever is the most delusional argument I’ve ever heard.

I’ve watched this, very little I understand as it’s beyond my comprehension, but when I hear random people say that BTC and it’s chain have no value I am staggered at their ignorance.
I believe and have for a long while that because this crypto token is programmable it has ever changing benefits going forward, no monetary system has this benefit.
When you have these super brains working tirelessly for improvements that they achieve, it makes me truly believe that crypto is the future of global finance and that those tokens that are part of these open Blockchains must be worth millions if they have the limited supply as BTC does.

I’m not buying one because John mcafee has endorsed it, personally I find him tedious, but that said he’s good at security.
Yet it wasn’t mcafee who designed it, I believe it was a team of people and the ceo of bitfi seems to have a good record if you read.
As far as their initial mistake which you pointed out and rightly that was a big mistake, I don’t see how that dooms the article, correct me but wasn’t a security flaw quickly patched recently with all Ledger hardware wallets, I remember the software update.?
All updates on bitfi are automatic which is less hassle for potential investors IMO.
As for the ledger blues apps, what apps are you meaning exactly as I’m not familiar, it doesn’t have monero integration but bitfi has monero from the start and a lot more crypto storage than ledger.
At present you’ve not convinced me Ledger is better or certainly less hassle or more secure.

I thought you’d have seen I answered your question, price Spurs adoption, the same as it does in the housing market and many other markets.
I think you’re problem with BTC is you think it’s a Ponzi scheme, when it’s a pyramid scheme, the latter is like most other markets.
Go and do some research on the BTC price you will find it always has gone back up and most times after a correction it goes up 6 times as much.
This is no different to other trading, you can win and lose.
But I assure you unless something major happened like the open Blockchain was hacked, BTC price will always rise long term, and we haven’t started yet, I could explain why in detail.

Whether it be cars and deforestation, beef and cattle farming, or general tech charging devices that use power.
I think they are all lame arguments as the power gets used in one way or another eventually, it’s not like if we don’t do this we save the planet, “NO” the power saved will inevitably be used elsewhere in time.
You’ll find most people who argue environmental are hypocrites.
Humans don’t stop consuming power, as power equals economic growth, and all countries strive for continual growth, 
Shut down power usage and inevitably your economies will suffer.
You could argue power use that doesn’t spur economic growth is bad, and that would be the first places that you should look at cutting, anything that uses power and makes money in and for an economy enriches our lives and stops us living in the gutter.

I wouldn’t say you’re wrong, it’s a well thought out reply, the only thing I believe you left out and ultimately gives most Asian countries the upper hand, is respect, they respect more in general.
Look I’m not anti American or anti anyone, but the west in general is seeping down the toilet through greed, personal greed and institutions.
If you point out to an American that their society is based on gang and drug warfare, prescription opioid OTC drugs which decimate society.
Gun laws that suit the terrorist and the gang banger, not the innocent, a country so blinded by being NO1 they forget regulation until it suits them, and is steeped in racism towards black people.
Do you know what they do,? “THEY DENY IT” in Asia most of those problems are not there.

They believe that if they create a bank backed crypto coin, they will give BTC and other top crypto coins competition they believe by creating a bank backed crypto coin their coin will make “OPEN BLOCKCHAIN TOKENS redundant or of far less value.
What their IT departments don’t understand is that the crypto they create will be centralised and not “decentralised” so it wouldn’t get chance to be in competition.
Also they don’t understand yet that people buy into BTC because it is permission less, this is one thing they can’t copy.
Plus it serves no purpose for the general public, if it was me I would just use fiat and my debit card, I see no reason for using a central bank backed crypto currency.
Next there is the issue of security, anything they create won’t be secure.

That’s bollocks you’re incentives to buy things would decrease hypothesis �� and there would be no incentive to invest, ummmm,
If Goods are cheaper in 12 months time, that doesn’t stop people buying now, it’s an argument in economics that’s had its day.
In fact if the bitcoin price rises year on year, that alone would spur spending, not what your saying.
Also there are shares and stocks that will always out preform BTC, so savvy investors will still invest.
The only downside is inflation, keeping a cap on that inflation, because increased spending Spurs that inflation higher.
Deflationary economies have not been ruled out from working.
You’re clearly ignorant when you speak of central banks aiming for 2% inflation as usually they fail miserably, history has shown this, and like the author of this post has mentioned money debasement isn’t a good economic model, as long term you go bankrupt.

I’m no expert but If your dealing with decentralised systems like tor, how come they haven’t succeeded in stopping it?
Take terrorist propaganda, it’s always existed and always will you can’t stop it, you can only defer it somewhere else.
My personal view is they know how valuable bitcoin is, they may not admit that yet, but once their closed so called “Blockchains” that they intend implementing fail, they will see just why bitcoin and is Blockchain mean so much.
I don’t believe you can ban bitcoin, more over I do not believe they want to do that.
I also think there are more trolls on Reddit that would like to see BTC banned than people who exist in government and financial authority, as I guess these people will be invested “just in case”.
You cannot take away the fact it’s a beautiful system born from beautiful mind.
Just as a point of issue, the banking system banned terrorist organisations depositing and laundering money, if you look at HSBC they had a list of known terrorist organisations.
Example being don’t take money from or flag up “terrorist organisation” they the terrorist got around this by adding a “dot” so “. Terrorist organisation” and just by adding that dot the payments went through and were not flagged.
This is barely high tech, yet people believe they can ban bitcoin, with the cleverest minds on the planet working 24/7DON’T  THINK SO.

I think most of that drawn out sonnet  is crap, people have to sign up for a
Traditional bank account, you could have said that was hassle back in the day.
What you miss is each time someone opens a new wallet crypto spreads.
And how weird that you state you have no interest for lending them all your money, I mean from my stand point
Your a mug.
The only thing you mention is a mortgage loan, which most people have to have, BUT BOY IF YOU CAN DO MATH , you will pay.
When I sign to open a bank account I basically sign to say I agree to lend a bank my money, note “ MY MONEY”, they then lend out my money for profit, if they the bank fall in hard times when my money is lent out, then it’s a clear case of fuck you ��.
The later happened in Cyprus in 2008/9
If you believe in banks on the basis they can give you a manipulated loan that’s fine, but to trust a bank I’d stupid.
Hence crypto is that hedge.
Tax evasion is with cash payments generally not through the banking system, this is why the banking system wants a cash free society , you’re  clearly an idiot to say BTC is the sole driver of money laundering.

Bitcoin wasn’t designed to be accepted or manipulated by these agencies, let the US get their dirty hands on anything and it will turn to shit.
The system was created to be purely peer to peer, can you see anywhere in the white paper the greed and speculation that has ensued since the creation of BTC.
And all the greedy people in BTC are worse than the banks, these are the biggest hypocrites, spouting for freedom but still wanting to get rich.
It’s one of the biggest jokes in history and it’s probably failing for these reasons.
Any true believers would say FUCK the SEC, fuck governments and banks and carry on a path of pure decentralised money purely “PEER TO PEER”.

Well you I agree in part, but they state a random 5 word or 5 word phrase, I am still a staunch believer that it’s easy that people want and need, in some way you answered this when you mentioned average joe.
Ledger and Trezor and others need to make it easier but just as secure, I believe bitfi have done this.

I would disagree completely, choosing any 5 word phrase that only you could know, would be multiple times harder to hack as it could be anything.
If someone loses their 24 seed word list or has it stolen their bitcoins are gone for good.
Brain seeds are harder to get as they aren’t kept written down.
Humans are bad at choosing random words, I could choose 5 now that with a brute force program would take thousands of years to crack, just like the 24 master seeds words, but without the hassle.
They won’t get hacked IMO, I don’t think you realise how hard it would be to crack a random 5 word seed.

It’s called living in a bubble society, the only reason London housing costs are so high is because of city trader money or the main cause foreign people with huge wealth to spend.
They push prices up, that then has an effect over the rest of the U.K. and this is worse because these people elsewhere have lower wages and less opportunity.
IMO while the party music lasts things will be fine, but there are signs that these over inflated prices sooner or later will drop or come to an end, housing relies on new buyers just like Bitcoin except houses aren’t divisible in such a way.
Many people eventually especially the young will wise up to this grand pyramid scheme, those people won’t buy, then markets will stagnate and foreign investors will cash out for something new or somewhere new.
The point is the party always ends in one way or another, it’s an illusion of wealth broadly speaking that is.

Generally crypto is seen as moving forward yes.
But America is a illusion, they don’t have as good a standard of living as say Norway, or many other industrialised countries in the EU, they are rich militarily and this is what they choose to spend the money they print on.
Not the poor, or those who just scrape by and there are many of these people in the states. If you’re serious go and drive through some of the places around the states, you’ll see lack of work and lack of wealth.
I consider it way from being a NO1 country, as given the choice I could choose from numerous others that have better living standards across society, less crime, less racial aggravation, and an overall more rounded societies.
So yes in my eyes I do see the states as backward, I think they are getting left behind in many fields.
You’ll find the US is about 12 richest country in the world, miles behind the likes of Singapore and Qatar and Luxembourg and Brunei.
The list goes on but these places per capita are more wealthy than the USA and far more advanced generally.
Americans just have the illusion they are the best ��. 
As I said backward as apposed to what people are sold or meant to believe.
And for anyone who wants to argue how forward and not backwards the US is, I read a story earlier about a guy who had prostrate cancer and no medical insurance, they only gave him pain killer till his death, not the drugs that could have saved his life, or even given him a fighting chance.
Backward as I said, as backwards as some third world countries, and many in the US have no access to medical treatment, barely first world.
The only Americans that argue different are those on the side of having well paid jobs and money, the hypocrite types.
And BTC hasn’t spread in America as it should because they’re still scratching their heads trying to figure out what it means.

There are so many stupid statements you’ve made, everyone knows gold mining uses overall way more power than BTC, also the banking system as a whole when you take all into consideration uses masses more, I mean I could go on but you and your friends still contribute and use those systems, maybe not gold but banking.

Of course they will, that’s why I sent you the video, it’s not an open Blockchain, and it doesn’t have the security through computer hashing power that real open blockchains do.
It will be hacked or manipulated, you cannot have a centralised Blockchain, it’s no different to what they have now.
Central banks must be able to manipulate the money supply, even if they create a token it serves no value as it can be created at will and manipulated.
If you’ve watched the video I sent a link for, you should realise that all this Blockchain talk from institutions is bullshit, they just don’t understand yet.
Who cares about the royal mint, you can get a gold backed token maybe, but who owns the private key? 
“Them or you”, if you don’t own you’re own key you don’t own anything.
Check what I said most economists think, central bank backed crypto currencies are folly at best.
This won’t let them not try, but it’s not BITCOIN and it can never have all of what makes BTC so Stella in its invention.

It’s a game of cat and mouse, these people aren’t stupid, BTC is on the radar of the wealthy and those who work for them.
The facts are first mover advantage, once one moves the rest will follow at some point, because that first mover and their clients will push the BTC price up.
The above scenario will make the other investors want exposure, in the long term you’ll end up with a BTC acceptance and a terminal price push (MOON).
The big question is who’s going to take that initiative.

Only about 20% of global gold is used in industry barely a valid reason to mine gold just to store in vaults.
Sounds like a good point until people see the percentage then it falls down.
POS has in general been looked at with scepticism as regards it’s overall security, all sounds nice and ideal, but for now nothing it more secure than POW, I know where I’d want my finances on the BTC open Blockchain “PERIOD”.
Maybe in the future bitcoins algorithm may change to a more energy effective method, but I doubt a shit coin will un seat it as it can adapt going forward.
Read the above about the beef industry and you’ll be staggered by the amount of energy used and how much pollution comes from that, all arguments become void, ���� listen.
And also may I add, I know of people who know people,  who are or were into gold and precious metals in a big way, most of the reports I’ve heard or asked opinion about, comes back as them saying that they believe BTC will in time decimate the gold industry, why because simply it’s better and easier to store and transfer.

But without these guys surely bitcoin is no different to normal money, normal money can’t adapt or evolve,

Schiff wants a gold backed currency just like the old days, because he knows that would push up gold prices, but the facts remain he’s uneducated about crypto and his speeches are always the same.
Digital currency or tokens just work so much better.
I personally think if they found a huge gold vein tomorrow and gold all of a sudden wasn’t scarce then its value would plummet, not that they have but BTC can only be 21 million.
Golds price like oil is manipulated via either mining more, or cutting back or storing, it’s a big lie really, and it’s second hand value is appalling.
Here in this article “in the last part “ is why what schiff argues for is complete nonsense, yet when you look at BTC it can easily do just what would be needed and what this liar says it can’t.

No physics has a general consensus, meaning their analogies of a situation or for an outcome that is agreeable to all is generally the rule, also you will find this in chemistry and biology.
Not so in economics, it’s “Mickey Mouse sudo science” at best, that they can’t get to work properly, they have variable degrees of disagreement is more the point between the existing so called world renowned economists, rather than agreement.
Looking back at 2008/2009 and please do, you will see numerous panels of these so called economists that couldn’t agree ways forward, they could hardly agree what day it was.
Now go and look at the world economy, keeping in mind some of these fools are advisers to the word bank and seriously tell me economics is serious stuff.
What you mean is it needs to be taken serious for all, and not the few and it hasn’t been and still isn’t being, hence the “debt piles of nations”, and the “can kicking.”
If you’d like I could give you a list of their names.
You’ll find they are all tantamount to being useless.
Oh and let me add why bitcoin is better than all of them, it’s real simple as BTC doesn’t need a nobel prize or a medal pinning on its chest, or any glory, so it not in competition it does what it was programmed to do.
Systems that have people competing for grandiose fame, end up in shambles.

There is only one coin “BITCOIN” fuck wasting time in the rest.

I had bitcoins on a paper wallet worth very little for four years, hope that puts bitcoins into perspective.

Bitcoins not going to become that big, you won’t sell it to everyone, it will become big enough probably to overthrow the likes of visa, MasterCard and Paypal and there will probably be a few billion transacting in it over the coming decades, but it won’t threaten state currency.
They won’t let it period, that’s not to say its value won’t sky rocket because it will for sure,  but they will find means to cap that price.

Yes I do now, still think most of the people from the USA on reddit are the ones who moan about American bank tyranny the most, can’t see much of a difference in personal freedom and speech between India and the US IMO.
How American are so anti free speech, ironic really as they’re usually the first to moan.

America has never been right “EVER” they are a fucking war monger mentality, that is hated the world over.
With numerous heads of state that have IQs below 40, just like the idiot who’s been elected now.

It’s the way people think and talk about doomsday scenarios without giving it a though, gold is better because it doesn’t need power hahha, yeah of course like we are all going to barter in a chaotic world with people we don’t know, with our gold.
Just pointing out how stupid you sound, and how vulnerable you’d clearly be.

You’re perception of the BTC market is strange, you’re basing all of your observations on the fact that BTC was in a bubble.
As long as you hold and BTC evolves there are no losers.
Like I explained losers create themselves by panic selling.
When you have far more liquidity in the market you will find the volatility starts to become less.
Until that happens you will see price swings.
The facts are bitcoin has doubled in price year after year, this is deflation.
BTC has nothing to do with decentralising banks, BTCs ecosystem just gives you choice, choice that your money goes up in value and not down, and getting over that middle man.
Your wages will be generally devalued at 2% a year if banks have their  way, sometimes it’s more than this.
This erodes purchasing power and discourages saving, leading to debt in society and debt that’s the wrong kind.
BTC encourages saving which is a good model especially in light of government debt, it isn’t a game it’s a serious player, you’ll only make money properly when you see it and understand it.

How long before wallets are integrated into all mobile phones as standard.?
Is this a good idea or a bad?

It’s not always about having a bank account, it’s more about having a job and a wage to be able to fund the account, people who have little money need it to live, there is none spare.

He’s in general boring, his books are boring and you’ll only see him on or in institutional programs or papers.
Barely worth giving him or his views the time of day, as realistically like all these economists, if they truly new the answers they would have implemented them along time ago and countries wouldn’t be running debt mountains.

I’m saying you prick that America isn’t a free country and most of the ass holes there moan about it on reddit, moan about their banks and their banking system, your not that more free than most people in India.
Americans have their accounts closed all the time for buying crypto, come on, land of the free FFS.

They’re backward and in massive debt.
