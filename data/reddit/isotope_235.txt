I knew I should of got more yesterday.
@_date: 2019-06-02 08:19:06
$8k was tough, but this is a good thing. Slow and steady.
@_date: 2019-04-11 18:58:46
Thank you for the warm welcome.
@_date: 2019-04-27 07:54:42
Morning! Buy whilst Low!
@_date: 2019-04-20 08:11:28
To own more bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-21 17:39:28
Entry? As in late into the bitcoin world?
@_date: 2019-04-25 20:46:11
I buy bitcoin when I have spare fiat. Don’t have a limit but just little and often.
@_date: 2019-04-12 10:42:36
Didn’t think about it like this, kind of a eureka moment. Cheers for that.
@_date: 2019-04-20 15:24:04
Why’s Coinbase pro better than Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-04-20 12:17:32
How do u buy everyday?
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:53:29
@_date: 2019-04-28 20:43:55
That’ll be nicked by tomorrow...... (Joke!) Good to see.
@_date: 2019-04-26 10:29:30
Sod it. I’m buying!
@_date: 2019-04-21 16:54:14
Yes I suppose you are right in this aspect. I feel there needs to be more competition in this market.
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:03:10
Why don’t they make a Coinbase pro app? Don’t expect an answer to this. Lol
@_date: 2019-05-17 09:42:58
It’s doomed DOOMED!! Better buy some more then. :-)
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:58:24
Pssst...bitcoin. Can you slow down a little, can’t get my fiat to clear fast enough!
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:46:48
You’ll probably look back at $8k and say the same thing.
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:13:52
Shitcoins are going crazy. Anyone wanna take a guess at what this means?
@_date: 2019-05-19 08:51:57
Morning all! I see the next increase has started. Good to see.
@_date: 2019-05-18 10:25:40
If it reached 100k per btc would you sell or are you hanging on until it becomes a currency which you can spend anywhere?
@_date: 2019-05-22 19:02:03
Finally got my trezor today and my btc are now off the exchange. Feels good.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:25:39
I have trezor and is excellent for cold storage, but the only issue is if you wanted to spend some bitcoin you can’t just use it.
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:54:34
I’ll have it. :-) ....please.
@_date: 2019-05-16 09:18:04
Nothing happens on a Thursday. I predict this weekend to be the 10k barrier breaker.
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:34:38
Etf decision?
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:28:54
Ok I’ll take my idea back. :-/
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:12:38
I highly doubt it’ll effect it now.
@_date: 2019-05-18 19:10:45
Nicely done.
