It's a very good idea to buy bitcoin, but yet I'm not sure, if the price decreases some more days. I hope Bitcoin will rise soon as possible.

Banks are deep in work because of Bitcoin.

Binance and it's history is really impressive. One year ago there was no Binance.

The probability to make profits by holding Bitcoin is much higher than buying a lottery ticket...
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:54:08
LOL, go BTC 
But it's not a Lambo :)

Logarithmic chart is definitely interesting and very underestimated.

Well, a Bitcoin is made of Gold and we all know how a Bitcoin looks like. It's a coin mixed with a **B** and a **$** sign. It's very difficult to divide a Bitcoin in it's own Satoshis.

Satoshi knew why he created the halvening ;)
@_date: 2018-07-15 21:07:13
Halving is a good thing, and it's still at it's beginning. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 16:16:09
And he still receives 50 BTC per block

It's in Poland?
@_date: 2018-07-15 19:57:53
Oh I don't hope so...
The price per Bitcoin is ridiculous low! 
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:02:50
I totally agree here, digital currencies controlled by governments can be easily abused...
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:51:56
True :)

A great community is not to be undervalued. And Bitcoin has one, since it was created. As stated in the article, Satoshi (or other early investors) could dump their coins to be rich, but they don't. 
And this is appreciated by the community, it's not all about making profits it's about making the money system better in first line. And the result will be profits for everyone who is trusting Bitcoin. A win-win situation.

Buy buy buy! 
It's time now, great move of Bitcoin. Next days will decide if we can break $10,000 again. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:39:22
Definitely not...
@_date: 2018-07-21 14:57:02
Would be a great move to ask him, if he could buy some for us...
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:41:56
Yes, and not burning them down :)

Transactions won't become slower if miners switch off, but difficulty will decrease to mine a block if it's no more profitable for miners having the most expensive conditions.

And when he buys a Lambo he'll add a sticker "successfully HODLed"

Great post! "The bank never goes bankrupt". Monopoly inventors know how things work :)

I agree, but ATM are good to get new people known of Bitcoin. If fees are lower, it would be much better.
