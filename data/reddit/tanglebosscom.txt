Yeah, in ideal world no one cares what his channels are connected to. But the coffee shop cares. And cares much. And is even going to pay for reliable services. And this leads to centralization. Even if you don't know. You are connected to John, and John is connected to centralized authority. And centralized authority - to the coffee shop. And the outage of the authority disconnects you both.
I really don't want to advertize the providers here. Looks like you don't keep yourself updated about the industry if you don't know what i mean.
I am also glad that you googled about the coin and that today you learned about the DAG. Btw, the idea can be implemented over the brilliant and flawless Bitcoin as well.

Pure Lightning forces POS operators to break channels every day to withdraw. In order to overcome this issue centralized providers are introduced. So Bitcoin will end up having centralized authorities. VolleyCash seems to be a simple replacement instead of centralized providers of persistent Lightning channels.

The whole conversation took the wrong direction. VolleyCash is better Flexa, not better Lightning Network. It is a solution for today. With only one disadvantage - a server, however it does not track and does not require to sign in. Probably people would like to try some cryptocurrency-based payment solutions today, not some day when LN grows, or whatever.

Withdraw means that at the end of the day a coffee shop will need to close LN channels with all today's payers in order to make today's payments be settled on the blockchain, and then the coffee shop will withdraw the BTC to fiat. In order to overcome this, providers of persistent channels arise today. Payers create channels with the provider, and those channels survive the night. The provider takes the responsibility for passing funds to the coffee shop. In short, the provider is that centralized party of LN that we all would dislike. Sad but true.

Right. But your QR and URI (from the phrase "you can pay the following invoice \[[QR]( / [URI]( instead" above) are generated by some third party. Think of VolleyCash like that third party.

Lightning already has a set of flaws, including centralized providers of persistent channels. Lightning Network will be a kingdom of few centralized services/authorities for retail use case. Please red this comment: [

I look forward the future that you are describing. Probably exceptional complexity of what you say is a severe obstacle why it is not around yet. Everything looks clear to you, but those who want to push that into prod, understand that it is highly immature. Let's wait. Also if you really need the example of the providers i said - it is https breez technology

Visa possesses funds solely. VolleyCash seems to share possession, so that the authority can not spend your money. This looks like a pretty new idea. I am surprised no one invented this before 2019.

Same as this [

Right. All you described is "ideally". Your point is in using some magic existing channels, opened elsewhere, that solve all problems. I simply feel like those channels will be against persistent authorities (your words "Those customers already have channels open elsewhere"), that provide dedicated wallet apps and services for retail owners. The outage of those authorities will impact the system severely (decentralization?). Does coffee shop want all money? Yes, they want all and now. And you are going to explain them "please wait for magic existing channels to appear". About the providers - i don't want to point fingers on those services. Please google.

I don't imagine entrepreneurs that magically solve all problems. Also large providers will always offer lower fee (than entrepreneurs) and earn due to higher volumes, reliability and additional services for retail. There will even be no fee at all (please google "dumping" economic term). Authorities will not block any traffic. They will simply concentrate it until there is no one in the room except them. Ecosystems, that are by themselves, concentrate. No exceptions. We have Google. Where are other search engines?
