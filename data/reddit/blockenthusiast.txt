Lol. Ok bud.   
The Mexican cartels are the direct product of state sponsored prohibition on the supply of goods desired by the market. Had the state provided the market with a path to accumulating those goods, Mexican cartels wouldn't be a thing. This does not meant that supporting the state (not that I do) means you support Mexican cartels.   
Plus we are in a blockchain sub. Silk Road (and similar markets) made drug dealing and purchases orders of magnitude safer because by default, supplying and buying drugs are not violent activities.   
The specific set of drug dealers being discussed here are darknet vendors who fall into that category of non violent for the vast majority of their subset. These are people putting their lives at risk to allow me, and many others to have safer and more regulated (thanks to reviews) access to substances that I will be doing regardless.   
Down the line, most purchases support:
* the exploitation of workers
* the destruction of the environment.  
* a system of violence.
At the end of the day, the market will get what it wants. Currently the state is obstructing that flow in a way that amplifies the violence. So I am totally fine suggesting on the record that I do not blame market providers for the environment established by the state.

Imagine you are browsing Amazon and intend to pay with BTC. Do you have an account with them? Have you paid for something before with that account? Once that first link of your address to your account is created they can check not just that account, but any account its interacted with. Even if you keep a main account of funds, and move smaller amounts to a hot wallet, that link is there, and they can see your worth. (Sure you can wash through Monero, or use a tumbler, but practically that should not be required). 
Once they have that information, and know how much you are worth, do you think they wont use that to their advantage? If they see you have a 50 BTC stashed away, they may be down to increase the price they charge you vs those who have only a few hundred satoshis in their account. They may just not show you cheaper products, or vice versa, not show expensive products to those with few satoshis.

He has phased himself away from being a requirement for the project. The only people who would sell at that point are the uninformed. Though I recognize that is the majority of the market.

It's good for us to have transparency on public organizations, and i'd agree that is somewhat worthwhile in that domain. However private citizens deserve privacy.

No one here think's he's a saint unless they were already a bit nuts to begin with. If your read what I wrote, you would know Vitalik has already been phasing himself out so on one is expecting him to guide the project forever.   
You have a biased view of what creating a distributed ledger technology entails, limiting it to only be launched as a clone of the first. That dogma will get you nowhere fast, and blind you from seeing objectively. The people mining and the people developing will always have control of what happens. Its those people who are actually making the whole system work. Fortunately, DLT is fairly opportunistic and open to anyone participating in that process. Even BTC/BCH/theforkdejour all have developers and miners who are in control of how the chain evolves.

Decentralized Oracle's are advantageous for things that do not have a trusted reporter. They have an additional benefit of having no downtime. 
For large scale, it wouldn't be crazy to have a trusted reporter. This could be handled like DGX though. Tokenize the asset, centralize the storage.  That already works, but would likely require a change in audit format for this application.

Ok. Let's put it this way. Nodes are nodes. Different entities are running nodes. Bob can't shut down Tom's node, and Tom can't shutdown Bob's node. 
Bob and Tom previously formed BT Inc. They let BT inc handle the workload of onboarding people to their network, and getting these individuals to collectively review and approve smart contract changes, before updating their own infrastructure to hit those new contracts. 
The blockchain they use is private. It is permissioned. It is distributed amongst their network. BT inc can shut down their own node. They can stop onboarding. They can stop upgrading, but they cannot shut down other people's nodes, other people's infrastructure or alter data that is not owned by them as an entity. They cannot push updates to other people's nodes. If Bob and Tom and all other participants want to stop running it they can, but that's how all blockchains crumble if they lack support.
It is a blockchain. And its leans very far toward centralized.

Well decentralization is an asymptote that cannot be achieved. It can only be approached. Your definition lacks nuance and basically can be used to say no current blockchain is truly a blockchain since all of them have certain centralized aspects. 
The tech is the tech. If its implemented by the world, or used for inter party commerce by a group of 400 participants it's still the same tech. To give that tech a different name by the number of participants doesnt make sense to me as a strategy

But such a solution wouldn't limit your access. Whereas JPM's coin will allow you to only control your coins, but they have admin privileges to control anyones coins.
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:59:28
What specifically doesnt make sense. Say there are 10 min without a transaction? Who will produce that block at a loss. 
You may find fees go up, difficulty decrease, but unless there is a transaction every 10 min that block either wont happen or be produced at a loss while the difficulty decrease lowers the security of the network and the higher fees make a higher barrier to use.
@_date: 2019-02-23 00:14:41
Say you have many parties who dont trust each other. DLT allows them to all be in agreement at all times without trusting a singular actor to control the data. It allows them to define rules for how data can be changed in the system as well.

So what you are saying is if the evm is run by less nodes it is no longer a blockchain?
If the evm is run by nodes that need to approve new nodes it's no longer a blockchain?
If the evm is altered not to use a native currency to reward nodes, letting them eat the cost, it is no longer a blockchain?
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:27:06
Not true. Blockchain technology only uses tokens to pay for the network costs when it's truly distributed, but private/permissions blockchains dont need a token as they can have alternative means of funding nodes.
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:58:04
Everyone keeps saying that. Super easy line to toe. Yet banks keep dropping serious money on these solutions and demonstrably saving significant money. Maybe it's worth questioning that parroted view?
For one example, say the central actor granting permission to participate on the chain is a non profit that already exists made up of all the actors that will participate. As it stands its opperating costs are high and its able to save money implementing dlt. In such a scenario no party trust each other so they all currently run their own DBs. Using DLT they no longer run into the problem of their individual DBs getting out of sync.  
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:27:49
Empty blocks are only processed because the blockreward covers the cost. Since the supply wont increase there will come a point where the block reward no longer exists. 
At that point, what would be the incentive to process an empty block at a loss?
The current idea is that there will be enough transactions to make the fees cover the cost of mining the every block but that wont work if the block is empty.
@_date: 2019-02-14 23:45:01
But that doesn't give individuals the ability to only edit their own transactions.

Basically in the cartoon, Vitalk is a person who wants to learn about BTC and thinks its cool when he see's it but did not found it. Hal Finney already knew what BTC is.   
I wouldn't take Vitalik being the first person the drug dealer met who was interested in BTC to suggest he understood it first. It's clear Hal Finney knew way more about what's going when introduced and I'm sure other major players will be introduced with a wealth of knowledge from their first intro, whereas Vitaliks journey is trying to understand what it is.

Centralized exchanges are necessary for fiat on ramps. Once on a chain, decentralized exchanges are generally better, though that is a can of worms in terms of how the DEX works and comparisons between methodology.   
However, it doesn't change the fact this push is to remove money from exchanges, not to pivot or drive that traffic into a new exchange. So if successful will lower the liquidity of all tokens removed from the trading circulation.  
I don't think its a conspiracy, but that's the attack vector that derives from the scenario.

People care because despite the fact that the public consensus came to an opinion on the matter, BCH supporters, and Ver in particular, publicly make the opposite claim, and try to confuse people. 
For instance Ver at one time set up "Bitcoin ATMs" that only served Bitcoin Cash. 
The issue is that people want the conversation to be clear. If I talk about Bitcoin, I expect you know which chain I am discussing, but if I talk about Bitcoin with a BCH fan we will be talking about two different things without explicit differentiation.  
If I changed my name to Vitalik, and started quoting myself saying, well Vitalik said "X", I'm sure people would also ask me to stop, since I would be muddying the waters of the conversation with misleading info. Objectively yes a person named Vitalik said "X", but in the context of the conversation, it is a play to provide misinformation purposely.

It's a world computer that can execute programs. These programs are often called smart contracts. There are some who feel that many don't actually meet this criteria including the man who coined the term.
According to him, the key difference between a smart contract and a regular contract is that a smart contract does not need any third party to enforce a transaction. It governs the ownership entirely during its applicable period. 
A regular contract can say Bob owes Sue $100, but that doesnt mean Bob will pay Sue that money. Often a third party is required, like a court system and wage garnishment to enforce the contract.
A smart contract is entirely self enforced.
Things like Ethereum and its competitors are platforms which have a native token (like ether) and can also have many tokens live within their platform enforced by programs loaded into their virtual machine.
You might use a smart contract on ethereum to send value and receive a different form of value back. 
This has applications in consumer protection, derivatives, governance, automated markets, and more.

Meh. Last year I was worried about buying an ebike instead of eth at around 200. I ended up getting the bike with the assumption my quality of life would improve from having this asset now rather than the possibility of more assets in the future. It turns out that was a good move cause now I've had that bike for over a year and had a ton of adventures that would not have existed without it. Plus I can get even more eth now for the same value.
I think every purchase should be weighted by its specific merits in the specific scenario you are presented with. It's not always a hard yes or no for passing up the purchase for more crypto .
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:28:40
You can mine it instead of buy it, however that's just abstracting the cost. To mine will cost you in hardware and electricity which may or may not be cheaper than just directly buying it depending on numerous factors ranging from the current price, to your personal electricity costs, to the amount of hash power currently in use on the network.
Otherwise you can buy it from numerous exchanges. I personally like coinbase pro, but there are tons of options to outright buy btc.

Alright so theres a bunch of computers that need to stay in sync. They do this with trees of hashes or data condensed into a set number of bits. It makes it way easier to compare.
Miners secure transactions by wasting resources trying to find a hash with the right number of leading 0s. The leading zeros are the "difficulty". They basically add a value to a specified attribute. This changes the value of the hash. Mining is just trying a bunch of values until you get a hash that has the minimum number of leading 0s. The difficulty allows the system to maintain the blocktime or the time between network synchronizations while allowing the hashpower of the network to fluctuate.  
The miners are incentivized to expend their hashpower which costs them resources by being rewarded by a block reward. This block reward ensures there are always blocks being mined since you can always get paid in the secured currency for doing so. However there needed to be incentive to actually include transactions in a block, as this makes finding a hash more effort. This is done by transactions including a fee which encourage miners to include their transaction over just mining an empty block.
So now that we've covered the basics of "securing the network", what is the network. The network is a ledger which tracks who holds what number of the total supply. It is censorship resistant since anyone can submit a transaction so long as they can cover the fee. It is peer to peer in that you can send value directly to another party without a middleman digitally. Sorta like if your money itself was the third party rather than paypal or its competitors. It also prevents double spends which basically negates the ability to copy and paste a digital asset. This means it prevents fraud.
People seem to have found intrinsic value in these benefits. Since people have found intrinsic value, they use the network. So long as people use the network, there is demand for the network token as the network can't be used without it. Since there demand for the network token, the miners have a path to profit by selling the network token to participants who desire the token. This completes the circle in that the network is able to self propel itself.
Currently people are speculating what the intrinsic value of the network will be, and this causes price volatility. The greater the intrinsic value, the greater the use, the greater the demand, the greater the price.

ICOs are Initial Coin Offerings which tend to be basic trade-able tokens on a smart contract platform.  
These tend to be fairly unrestricted investments in potential future microeconomies. Newer models are being worked on to add more consumer protection features such as the DAICO. These models have more structure on use of the funds raised.  
Microeconomies can be really cool when delivered.   
The money raised is intended to be used towards building the economies structure, and are often very complex missions into uncharted territory. Many will fail. Some will succeed.

There are different kinds of contracts. ICOs are typical very bitcoin like tokens. Contracts can be very complex functionality.
ICOs are generally contracts that are tokens and typically on the ethereum network. There is a token standard that enforces having certain functionality called ERC-20. This standard is interacts very much like bitcoin or ether. It however does not cover gas fees on the network is lives on. It can be traded. Sent between addresses. Some have additional functionality. Most are bought to fund the development of some kind of new functionality either on their platform, or transition them to their own platform, like eos did.
Some ICOs have lead to products like the decentrally backed stable coin dai. Some coins fund networks, or plan to be used as the currency in some kind of micro economy. They can represent voting rights, ownership, or whatever functionality can be coded.
Some smart contracts can be games, gambling, etc initially, but also complex financial institutions, and other value/access transferring mechanisms.

In that profit maximizing sense, yes Binance would like to lose less than what Hacker poses for the move to make sense. However by bidding for the reorg and forcing the Hacker to counterbid, they can deplete the hacker of hacked funds. So even losing the Bid and not achieving the Reorg can be in Binance's interest as it can reduce the profit of the hack.
