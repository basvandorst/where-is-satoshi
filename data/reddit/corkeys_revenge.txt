You know we can see your post history right? You know that it shows you're a a loser that plays too many video games, has never bought crypto in his life and only comes around here when bitcoin drops? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:53:28
Don't be jealous that I called it nearly perfectly. Anyone that followed my advice is already up. Big time.

Lol at all the people from All trying to rub salt in people's wounds. Watch as they disappear when we bounce from the impenetrable 10k floor. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:51:14
To lose so much money that we swear off material things and turn to Buddhism to find inner peace. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:33:31
This thing will obviously rocket off of the $10k floor. Might as well get in now at $10.5k for guaranteed gains.

I want to get off Mr. Bitcoins wild ride :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:00:47
Identity theft.  Possibly to steal your penis and sell it on the black market too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:53:58
Nah, $14,500 is rock solid support.  At least for a few days.

THE GAME HAS CHANGED, SON OF FLYNN!

Even Beanie Babies didn't drop to zero.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:52:42
I thought I bought the dip when I went all in at $16,500.  January rent is going to be tough...
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:44:37
Feels like a lot of people are looking to lock in some of their huge gains, but not before the new year so as to delay paying taxes on it.  The selling we're seeing now is some of them getting nervous over what could be an avalanche of selling at the start of the new year. So they're unloading now.  Thus the slow bleed.

Any particular buys you'd recommend at the moment? Not that I'm trying to get out of doing my homework on them or anything.  Actually, that's exactly what I'm trying to do.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:23:58
You're forgetting half of us are newbies that bought at $16,500 or higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:00:25
Yeah, but there was no dips along the way. It was all "one million by 2020" and talk of ball eating a couple weeks ago. Seemed dumb not to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:03:09
It will see $200k before it sees $2k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:27:15
And now it's back to $14k.  Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:59
It recommends buying BCH

In these trying times, I take solace in [Captain Picard's]( words of wisdom. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:31
I already went all in when it dipped to $16,500.  What more do you want from me?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:47:47
You don't own any coins.  Look at your posting history.  First mention of bitcoin ever.  You're just having fun because you smell blood in the water.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:38:20
Forever.  Just like our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:08:20
Once you hit buy, you can't sell until your funds clear.  So if bitcoin shits the bed over the next few days (not likely) you're fucked.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:05:29
So you're saying it will either go up or down? Thanks, Warren Buffet! Hey, could you write an ebook about crypto currency and sell me a copy? If you don't mind. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:43
The US government is taking out Bitcoin at the behest of the big Banks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:06
Not for long.
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:24:51
Now this is the kind of grounded, well thought out DD I can get behind. Jesus, take the wheel. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:52:55
Yeah sure, redditor for three months.  What's wrong? Got your previous bitcoin calls so wrong that you needed to create a new account to hide the fact that you're talking out of your ass?
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:16:28
It worked! You guys are going to get it back to $19,000 on meme power alone.  I don't own any, but I'll still wave to you from earth after you land on the moon.
