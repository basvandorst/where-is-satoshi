Here's what you want to do:
Go to localbitcoins.com.  You will find a seller who will be happy to sell you bitcoins, usually late at night in an alley behind a liquor store.  You'll need to get into his car with the cash.  Since there is a likelihood that he will try to rob you, you'll need to be armed.  Good luck.

None.  Walmart would save no money if all purchases were made using bitcoins.
Credit card fees are as high as they are due to customers receiving cash back on their purchases, and fraud protection.  If everyone was using bitcoin, they would be using bitcoin credit cards, which is what coinbase and bitpay would become.  Governments and consumers would demand fraud protection, consumers would want cash back incentives, and the fees would rise to the 2 to 3% that we see today with credit cards.

Think about this:
The network is supposedly protected by the fact that it takes a 51% attack, which would require hundreds of millions of dollars in ASICS, to compromise it.
But, oh wait!, it only takes $300 per hour to shut the network down with spam transactions.
$300 per hour to shut down a network valued in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars.  If you all can't figure out something is wrong here, something which badly needs fixing, you'll certainly have it figured out come Monday.
Be glad the people doing this have the best interests of everyone in mind.  A destructive group could do the same thing.  Or simply a greedy individual could short bitcoin, shut down the network, and wait to see how far the price falls, and then repeat the whole thing again and again.

I was unable to follow most of that, as happens whenever someone attempts to explain lightning networks.
However, there are a few alternatives.
1 - Lightning networks offload a small or medium percentage of the bitcoin transactions.  Like 10% or 25% or even 50%.
In this case, there's no point in having them, you might as well just fix the bitcoin network and do it all with bitcoin.  The clumsiness of having two separate networks isn't worth it.
2 - Lightning networks offload a large percentage of the bitcoin transactions, like 90% or 99%.
In this case, why not dump bitcoin altogether and just use the lightning networks?

1.  Yes, until Bitcoin collapses, government regulation and insurance and so on will start to be put in place, all of which will raise fees on the network.
2. The amount of time it takes for a transaction to be utterly complete and final is not the issue.  You don't have to wait a month at 7-11 to buy your gasoline and your big gulp, your credit card transaction goes through instantly.  
3. You're ignoring the big picture in this statement.  The fees are being paid by someone, and in the long run, it will be you, the online vendor.

The general opinion of this thread seems to be that the bitcoin network is, in fact, less efficient than traditional banking, but that it still has value in various other ways.
However the mainstream financial community and media are completely unaware of this, and are operating under the assumption that bitcoin will have value in the future due to the low fees resulting from its inherent efficiency.
The business community, the financial community, can be interested in a currency or money transfer system which promises to save money.  If Bitcoin is about some anti-establishment ideology, will they ever get behind it?
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:29:27

Monetary inflation is an increase in the money supply, and the cost comes from everyone's pocket who owns that currency.
The more bitcoins there are, the less each of them is worth.  If everyone involved agreed to change the bitcoin software so that the network was flooded with coins and there were billions of them, each coin would be worth a tiny fraction of what it is today.  If instead, 95% of the current bitcoins were lost forever, but everyone still wanted bitcoins, the price of them would go up 20 fold perhaps.
Mining rewards ARE monetary inflation, whether you realize it or not.  It's just that no one ever talks about it, since bitcoin's exponentially increasing price makes this seem trivial.

If it's done based on the bitcoin protocol, it will have all of bitcoin's weaknesses.  The only (and simple) solution to the various problems of bitcoin is to ditch the blockchain and the hashing and just have a centralized network.  But we already have that, so no need to recreate it.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:28:20
Care to briefly explain how you will make a decentralized currency which will solve the core problems of bitcoin?  (Long transaction times taking place in a highly inefficient network)
@_date: 2014-03-13 05:01:01
Nope, I'm not confused.
Due to the fact that processing power on the network is increasing all the time, blocks are actually being solved quicker than every 10 minutes.  The blocks that should be taking 2 weeks to be solved are being solved days earlier than that, which is why the difficulty rate keeps increasing to compensate.
Since blocks are being solved quicker than 10 minutes on average, this means that more than 3600 bitcoins per day are being added to the network.

The bottom line is, a bitcoin miner imbedded in a cell phone is going to produce something like 25 cents worth of bitcoin a year.
This doesn't produce enough revenue for anyone to make any of this make sense.  If 21 Inc gets all of the mining revenue, this doesn't allow them to give away the cell phones or provide incentives or do anything else, it's not enough money.
But 21 inc can't even get all of the 25 cents per year, because there has to be some incentive for the user to leave the miner running down his battery all the time.  If the user gets all of the 25 cents per year, it's not enough money to make it worth having his battery run down all the time.
There is no money in cellphone mining, which is why nobody's doing it today and nobody is ever going to be doing it. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 11:09:32
The great thing about this is that we could simply shut down the blockchain altogether, since consumers would be paying with dollars and the merchant is receiving dollars.

Let me explain the way it would work, in the event that Bitcoin became widely used as a currency.
If you had a job, the government would take your bitcoins right out of your pay, just as governments do now with fiat currency.
If you were self employed or a business owner, the government would require you to pay taxes on your bitcoin earnings.  If you tried not to, or tried to cover the earnings up and got caught, the government would order you to pay what you owed.  If you tried not to pay, they would seize all your possessions and throw you in prison.
So, can the government force you to hand over your bitcoins?  No, just as they can't force you to divulge where you buried a box of cash.  But you won't enjoy those bitcoins much when you're in prison, or when they've seized all your possessions and continue to seize any new possessions you acquire.

Yes, consumers are going to be overjoyed to receive a phone which gets half the battery life of a normal phone, in exchange for receiving 3 cents a month worth of bitcoins.
And the manufacturers of said phones will absolutely not see their sales tank because consumers are all buying phones with normal battery life instead.
But what makes it all work is that consumers will be tricked into taking these phones, which will be given away FREE, because the 5 cents a month worth of bitcoin which the mining company gets will easily pay for the manufacture and distribution of the phone.
And the real purpose of 21 inc is certainly not "dupe investors into giving us $115 million".

is actually a spin-off of the somethingawful forums bitcoin thread.  There has been a thread on somethingawful continously for at least 4 years now, stretching into the tens of thousands of messages, and it's always been critical of bitcoin.  The general attitude and criticisms (and terminology such as "buttcoin") all transferred over from somethingawful to The real purpose of the somethingawful thread and of is to provide a critical view of bitcoin, which is almost nonexistent anywhere else.  The bitcoin software and protocol are complex enough that almost no one who isn't a bitcoin enthusiast knows anything about it, and as a result, a critical view of it is difficult to find.  You won't find it in the media, as reporters generally just parrot whatever previous reporters have said.
Why is there so much mocking involved in the criticism?  A more reasonable question might be, how could one NOT mock the current bitcoin community?  The general view here is that bitcoin is going to replace all currencies worldwide, destroying all governments, and leading to some sort of global libertarian/anarchist utopia.  This is utterly laughable.
I believe that is valuable because we need a critical view of bitcoin, and you'll never get that here.  I believe there are major flaws in bitcoin which make it impossible to scale up, and that the financial community and investors are wasting their money on something which can't possibly go anywhere.  Perhaps I'm wrong, but somebody needs to be taking the critical view, and people who are simply interested in cheerleading their investment will never do so.

Some roads would be free, with advertising, some would have toll booths every few miles, some completely undriveable unless you had a previous contract with the road's owner.
A 300 mile long highway might have 30 different names/numbers along its length, as each owner makes up their own name for the road.

So, there will be a centralized banking system, under the control of the large banks and the government.... but with bitcoin.
If the purpose of bitcoin is to make current bitcoin holders wealthy when the price goes up, then this would be good news indeed.

The person receiving the shillings has to pay an additional 3.7% to withdraw them in cash.
And this has nothing to do with "Bitcoin in Kenya", nobody in Kenya is receiving any bitcoins at all.  You pay Bitpesa in bitcoins, they send fiat currency to the Mpesa network in Kenya.

So, let me get this straight.
Despite the fact that Bitcoin was developed by cryptography enthusiasts, despite the fact that the Bitcoin community is full of libertarians and anarchists who hope to weaken their governments, despite all the currency speculators and Satoshi dice gamblers and silk road and the online tipping culture and all the attempts to get amazon and microsoft and every other big company under the sun to accept bitcoin....
It's really all about poor Africans and rural Mexicans who don't have bank accounts?
Was it just an oversight that this somehow didn't make it into the Bitcoin FAQ  or that none of the reddit bitcoin communities seem to be focused on this?
I don't for a second buy that bitcoin is about helping out poor disadvantaged people who don't have enough money for banks to be interested in.  Instead, the hope is that maybe the poor disadvantaged Africans might buy up large amounts of bitcoins, which will make those privileged white guys who already own them rich.
For christ's sake, be honest about what Bitcoin is about.

From the website:
"Tools such as ChangeTip have given us powerful ways to interact, exchange value, or simply say thanks using Bitcoin without any trusted third parties involved". 
Changetip isn't a trusted third party?
So I, party number 1, want to send a tip to Bob, party number 2.  The money goes through changetip, who I trust to send the tip to Bob.  Which party number would changetip be, exactly?  I know it's the number that comes after two.....

So I could go somewhere with a low price for human life, such as an African country, for example, and buy up a number of them.  And then transport them across the ocean the most efficient possible way, which would be on a large ship.
And then sell them to the highest bidder in the U.S., for use in various farming activities.
This does sound promising!

Something's wrong with the math here.
10,091 tips x 79% acceptance rate x $1.49 average tip should equal about $12,000.  But only $3163 was successfully received.
Unless the larger tips were significantly less likely to be accepted than the smaller tips, which would be very odd.

You're assuming that what happens is:
1. Coalition of miners forks the blockchain and possibly attacks the old blockchain.
2. The rest of the network valiantly resists this attack.
What I'm saying is more likely is:
1. Coalition of miners threatens to fork the blockchain, tries to talk others into accepting their new version of the protocol.
2. They succeed, as no one wants to experience the battle which you described above.
The miners will, on the one hand, have a reasonable argument ("Bitcoin has always had inflation, we're just going to continue it at a low level"), and on the other hand, a big stick that they're threatening to whack everyone with.  There's also the potential of them bribing the developers and exchange operators in various ways.
It's usually not necessary to actually fight to get what you want, merely the ability and willingness to fight will often get everyone else to compromise.

It's 2020, there are only a handful of large miners, not hundreds of them.  They've formed an OPEC like organization and decide between themselves how much hashing power each of them will or won't add to the network.
They realize they're all about to be screwed when the block reward is cut in half, so they go screaming to developers, exchanges, everyone, that they're going to have to raise transaction fees substantially(refuse to accept transactions with fees less than X), thereby taking away the thing that the public and business likes so much about bitcoin.
They half convince people they are right, and half threaten the hell out of everyone, as everyone is afraid they will just hard fork one way or another and attack the remaining blockchain.  No one wants the chaos this would create.  They bribe exchanges and developers by also adding to the new protocol x% of block awards going to the developers or the exchanges, or whatever other bribe they think might work.
It's the nature of humanity that people in power conspire with other people in power to get all of them what they want.

You could make the same claim about literally anything.
Never heard of dead racoons &gt; misinformed about dead racoons &gt; informed about dead racoons &gt; ambivalent about dead racoons &gt; supporting dead racoons is a one way transition.
As it is not violent and totally optional, everyone without an underlying emotional issue (such as bitterness at the feeling of missing out, or a pathological need to tear others down to prop up ones own ego) cannot help but arrive at the conclusion that dead racoons' existence is good competition in a free market for competing services, even if they don't want to use them.
Then all it takes to get another dead racoon lover is any of the following:
 a dash of curiosity (humans are naturally very curious beings, in fact intelligence highly correlates to curiosity)
 discovery of a practical use case (such as roadkill stew, taxidermy, doorstop, garden fertilizer),
 significant support among local peer group so it becomes normalised to like dead racoons unless justified by a specific reason, rather than the other way around,
 realisation of personal potential for profit, indicated by an ever growing volume of media mentions of dead racoons and a broader trend to mammal corpse utilization.

Without the miners, no more blocks are added to the blockchain and the network no longer functions.
With only 5% of the miners, blocks are solved... every 200 minutes. Everyone will go to the fork that is actually functioning, which is going to be the one that the miners have chosen.
I'm pointing out something you may not have realized, which is that the miners control the network, if they choose to do so.

Our primary means of information exchange and communication 20 years ago was not snail mail.  People spoke on the telephone when they weren't close enough to each other.  Perhaps you're thinking of 1895.
Also, nobody was preaching the merits of email 20 years ago.  Email began with Arpanet in the 1970s, originally it was researchers, and then college students, using it.  As this and other networks expanded and became the internet, email grew with it.
The general public finally began to be interested when the web was invented, and when companies like AOL were able to provide web access cheaply and easily to everyone.  Email was part of what made this whole internet thing sound worth trying.
There was never any preaching involved, although big companies like AOL were certainly advertising.  There were fears that one day the entire mass of the earth would consist of AOL free trial disks.

I don't want to take the chance of losing my bitcoins, so naturally I don't store them where anyone else can access them.
I use a paper wallet, which is buried 20 feet underground in a lead-lined vault which I constructed specifically for this purpose.  The vault has several feet of concrete, surrounding a lead layer, and inside this layer is a waterproof layer which keeps the inside of the vault entirely dry.
I'm currently living inside this vault, and I've tunneled down beneath it, excavating a vast cavern where I grow mushrooms for food. At one end of the cavern I tapped into an underground lake, where blind cave fish provide protein, and they're actually quite tasty as well.
After the collapse of society, there will be a period of time, which I refer to as The Cleansing, where large portions of humanity will perish.  I shall wait out this period in my underground vault, until the day I ascend to the surface, bitcoins in hand, to take my place as one of the world's financial elite.

I'm interested in getting involved in what is sure to be the top zero capital business model of the next decade, collecting wild berries.
After spending the day out wandering the roadside finding and picking berries, I proudly come home to my wife to show her the bushel I have collected.  "Oh honey", she says, "I'm so proud of you.  Now the kids and I can eat. Well, berries anyway".
She will no doubt become proficient at cooking many recipes with berries (she'll pretty much have to).  Berry pie, berry milkshake, roasted berries, boiled berries, berry surprise (the surprise is, there are small berries inside the big berries!), berries with berry sauce.  The possibilities are endless.
As I understand it, berry picking opportunities are quite limited during the winter, so we'll have to store up plenty of them ahead of time.
It will be a brave new world for my family and I, a world of fun, adventure, and berries.

The anti-bank bias in r/bitcoin is preventing many people here from being able to read and understand the article.  Nothing is beginning that will affect you, unless you happen to be a large institutional investor trying to temporarily park your $5 billion in a bank account.
The WSJ has more on this story (behind a paywall).  From the WSJ story:
"Since the financial crisis, new rules have been put into place that require banks to maintain enough high-quality assets that could be converted into cash during a crisis to cover a projected flight of deposits over 30 days. Because large, uninsured deposits would be expected to leave most quickly, the rules will now require that banks maintain reserves for those deposits that they cannot use for profitable activities like making loans. That makes it much less efficient or profitable for banks to hold these deposits".
What this means is that if some group has a short term billion dollar deposit which appears likely to be taken back out soon, the big banks such as JP Morgan will have to keep most or all of it in reserves, and won't be able to loan it out or do anything with it.
Since they can't do anything with it, they can't make any money from it, so they'll have to start charging fees to hold it.
None of this has anything to do with bitcoin.

The entire bitcoin network is funded through monetary inflation.  Without inflation you'd be paying high transaction fees, and would have been all along.

Multiple people gave this same reply, that miners would never do such a thing.  Yes, today they wouldn't.
But what about in a future where bitcoin is being used much more widely than it is today?  Where some portion of the public has become used to using it on a regular basis?
If bitcoin were widely used, everyone wouldn't just abandon it because of some (to the average person) trivial concern relating to inflation.  They'd go right on using it, which means the price wouldn't collapse.
I think it's naive to believe that miners would never attempt to use their control over the network, which they do have, in order to grab more money for themselves.
