A trailer always briliant and free, for sure :) . When u acept 15$ per tx and they give u LN fee for 5$, u must be happy. Lol no more free currency, no more decentralize, u sure that’s Bitcoin like u think?

No, cryptocurrency first thing is about transparent which something Facebook/Mark never ever has.

I dont think so, or it would take a long long time. But who knows, market is crazy.

I remember one time when everyone in this sub talk about Lightning Network and how amazing it was, how it could be game changer. Come back after over a years and no one want to talk about it anymore. Yes, its bullsh*t

Why was BTC up?
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:11:47
2.000 stop loss for 10x leverage is too risky
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:57:18
Or just invest 999.000$ and you will be a millionaire for sure.
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:58:29
This is more brain washing than lightning network.

Not sure If it can bounce back stronger. You know It different between rise from 1.000 to 20.000 and from 4.000 to 80.000 ( both 20 times ). And the market never be the same, next time It would be harder. I would buy under 3.000, not now.

Nothing you, me or we can do. Market works itself, we only follow it.
