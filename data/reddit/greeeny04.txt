Ok but if they lose your bitcoins how can they replace it? Anything FDIC insured is "insured" by the government by printing fiat if the banks (Coinbase) fucks up. So they can give you fiat but your bitcoin is not insured.

If you've been following bitcoin since 2010, how can you say that its a fad that died, when the price is 4000 today and under a dollar in 2010? Nothing has changed? Do you believe the words you are typing?
Maybe you don't see a reason to use bitcoin, but many other people do. 
Can you elaborate why you like "crpyto" but not bitcoin? I'm under the impression that you have no idea what proof of work is.

You can’t claim it’s horrid if you don’t know how the consensus protocol or payment system even works. Bitcoin has the best utilization of blockchain in the world by far. Please stop saying “acts like a stock” because it changes in value lol. Bitcoin is an investment for me and a hedge against our fucked up economy. For others in less developed countries, it’s a very powerful tool for censorship resistance and preserving wealth among other benefits. The market price will move faster and slower than the actual progression of bitcoin in terms of adoption and development. In 2017, a lot of dumb money entered strictly for speculative purposes, and they got burned. When bitcoins bubble pops it consolidates at a higher low, and then begins another ascent to higher highs. This would be the fifth or sixth time. It’s a long term investment for me, I don’t get bothered by the volatility, I know where it’s headed. 2017 probably wont be the last time bitcoin ascends too quickly either.
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:38:34
There can never be a crypto that is stable from inception unless it’s pegged to  some other asset which would make it centralized. Goods are not valued in bitcoin yet because it’s too early and has many more years to mature. The transition is “slow” meaning it doesn’t happen overnight, but no asset/commodity has ever risen as fast as bitcoin has in history. Bitcoin would  be as stable as the dollar is today if everyone transitioned from fiat to bitcoin. Instead of a slow stable decrease in value like what the dollar experiences, bitcoin would be a slow and stable increase in value. Slow deflation is better than slow inflation. Bitcoins only flaw is that it can only handle 4-7 transactions per second. Hopefully lightning network fixes that problem. Seems to be already. If not, bitcoin will become a gold 2.0, in which case it’s still severely undervalued. 
Our currency has been relatively stable through its existence, barring the fact it lost like 98% of its value. Bitcoin is not just for the United States. Most other currencies are worse off than the dollar, and I believe the dollar is in for a rude awakening. People have too much trust in the financial systems, the mortgage bond crisis should be a red flag.
@_date: 2019-03-27 04:40:47
To say currency and money can't be used interchangeablly would be saying that fiat currency aka dollar bills are not money. I think its quite irrelevant to differentiate between the two. As for the payment system, bitcoin was created to be used as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system aka payment system. Don't need to read an entire book when I can read the first line of the whitepaper. Yes, I agree that bitcoin as a store of value, a Gold 2.0, gives it value, but its use as a currency (money) will give it even more value, assuming bitcoin will be able to scale (lightning network).

Why would you define a payment system as something that can match Visa. That seems so arbitrary. If bitcoin makes 4 transactions per second, it is still a payment system. I agree that the money we use today are debt instruments, still considered money by the population and dictionary.com's definition, I think its pointless to debate the intricacies of these definitions.
@_date: 2019-03-27 19:39:19
I have been, and bitcoin isn’t a stock btw, it doesn’t provide cash flows or expectations of future cash flows. It’s not a business. Saying it is a stock because it’s price changes is similar to saying gold, wheat, bonds, oil, etc. are all stocks.
@_date: 2019-03-27 05:07:57
You have a lot to learn. It will be tough because your opinions have been flawed by many misleading media headlines.

@_date: 2019-03-30 03:29:41
I agree with your advice, but I don’t agree with it being negligible. The more bitcoin increases in value, and let’s be real, it has wayyy more to go, the bigger the difference between 4500 and 3800. Still not worth the risk of waiting, buy as much satoshis as you can when you can.
@_date: 2019-03-28 19:29:43
If people start to see goods priced in bitcoin, buying milk would be something like 5000 satoshis. Volatility decreases as more and more people and companies jump on board the bitcoin train. It would not be priced as .00005000 bitcoins lol. All your fears are catalysts for the future.
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:10:18
I think there’s a reason your being so closed minded on bitcoin. Someone has influenced your opinion on bitcoin early on, maybe the first article you read, someone you know, or someone you trust for information. It’s very hard to admit when we’re wrong, so no matter what I say, or how high bitcoin goes in price, or how much adoption grows, you will always reject it for this reason. But you are misinformed and you are wrong. Best of luck holding fiat, hopefully the fed doesn’t fuck you up too much.
The way you think bitcoin is like a stock proves how illiterate you are with financial assets/ commodities. It might be best for you to not buy into bitcoin. They do say don’t invest in what you don’t understand, and you seem to spend more time debating why bitcoin is bad than learning about why it is not. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 19:36:17
I believe in a world where people use a currency that actually has value because people find value in its utility, not because the government declares it to have value. The gold standard was great, and provided a natural economy, once Nixon took the dollar of the gold standard he created an unsustainable bubble economy. Our economy right now is artificially pumped by cheap money and low interest rates, it’s not sustainable and I don’t trust the Fed to allow stocks to fall (by raising rates) to protect the dollar. 
Rapid deflation is bad I agree same as rapid inflation, but to compare a bitcoin standard or gold standard to a deflationary fiat currency is a bad model to use. Using a finite money provides a healthier economy that doesn’t create bubbles like the one we are in today. Stable deflation is better than stable inflation like the US dollar.
The irrational fear the bitcoin can just drop to zero as if it doesn’t have any utility is similar to worrying about buying gold cause it can fall to zero. There will always be people that find value in using the bitcoin network. That number continues to grow, which is why we’ve seen bitcoin rise to where it is today. 
You don’t want transactions you make public. Are you aware that governments are striving for a cashless society. That way it will be easier to monitor every transaction made, and if they decide a transaction shouldn’t happen they can stop it, freeze accounts, close accounts, and confiscate money wether the transactions are legal or not. How can you favor a system of money that is constantly being censored? You don’t want the public to see transactions, only the central authorities that have power to do whatever they want with your money.
It’s popularity is growing. Corrections/crashes happen when enough uninformed people aka weak hands, buy strictly out of speculation and to sell when price goes up. When all these people leave and get rekt you’ll see bitcoins new bottom is now higher than its previous high. It’s been growing at this pattern for 10 years now. If you still don’t believe it’s popularity is increasing, check the graph of bitcoins hash rate in 2018 when the price dropped 80%.
@_date: 2019-03-27 14:38:34
Bitcoin is not a stock. Leading an argument with an aggressive incorrect statement is a bad start. 
Fiat currency fails by design. The average lifespan of a fiat currency is approximately 27 years. The dollar as a fiat currency is 48 years old, and the current climate it’s in at the moment is not promising in the slightest. Watch out for QE4.
The no stability argument is a thoughtless one. As bitcoin grows from a market cap of basically nothing, to one that can sustain a global economy (tens of trillions of dollars today), of course it will be volatile. The more it grows the more it’s volatility decreases, as already seen in its 10 year history.
Set cap is one of the features. That’s what gives it value. Things that are limited are more valuable. This is why fiat currencies fail, inflation is bad and only serves as a hidden tax and a benefit to the first spenders (the rich), while everyone else spends a less valuable dollar.
You don’t even understand the tech, so how can you make these claims. Any crypto that doesn’t use proof of work isn’t decentralized. Any stable cryptocurrency isn’t decentralized, it’s tied to a centralized fiat which is controlled by the few at the expense of the many. Any bitcoin copy is a less popular and less secure network.
If you were actually following bitcoin since 2010 which I think is absolute bullshit. You should be kicking yourself in the foot cause a one dollar investment then would be worth over 20 grand today. You’re also wrong, bitcoin is not a fad and it’s not going away, if you don’t learn why you will continue to be very frustrated at its existence.

Invest in what you believe. If you think stock markets, bond markets, and fiat is a safe long term store of value then save your money in those assets. If you think the risk/reward of bitcoin or other cryptos is worth it than ride it out. I personally think bitcoin has a much better chance of succeeding than not, and the payout is life changing. Why would I sell because it's going through its 5th market cycle? I also think fiat is destined to fail. Buy when others are fearful, sell when others are greedy.

Just because no one can give an exact date doesn't mean it wont be within a decade. Just because you can't use it at your local grocery store doesn't mean it isn't being used at all. Adoption is growing by the day. You need to do some research about fiat to understand why cryptocurrencies is the real deal. Maybe it isn't bitcoin, definitely the safest bet right now, but cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and centralized money backed by faith in incompetent governments will be worthless. You sound young, so you should be able to handle the volatility, why do you think so many people say it's a long term investment. If you can't handle the volatility don't buy it, but when adoption grows, and bitcoin stabilizes, price will be much higher then.
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:31:42
Mass adoption takes time. Clearly no one can give you a date that's not possible. This isn't a crisis. Bitcoins long term trend is doing extremely well. People who think and say this is a crisis have no idea what they're talking about.

Bitcoin and stocks are obviously not comparable and anyone who thinks they are shouldn’t be commenting. However, if you had to point to which one was a bubble, you’d have to point towards stocks. I don’t know why people choose to reject bitcoin after reading negative headlines. If you read/ listened both sides of the bitcoin argument, and learned why the tech behind bitcoin (not shitcoins) but proof of work is amazing, I don’t see how you can think this is just a giant fad. The value is real, the utility is real, and more and more people will become hodlers. If you don’t bother to truly understand why, as in not asking people on reddit, but actually reading books articles and videos of really smart people in the community.

Your understanding of history is majorly flawed. Gold mining being slowed down isn’t even a thing, and even if it was it didnt cause the end of the gold standard. Gold mining being slowed down would increase the value of gold. Dollars aren’t backed by oil, they just used oil to increase its demand globally. Being tangible doesn’t give something value, utility does. Bitcoins utility as money is far greater than any money in the history of the world. 92% of dollars in circulation arnt tangible, and who cares if it is, its a piece of paper lol. Read the Bitcoin Standard if you truly want to learn about the history of money, it goes into a great length about it.
@_date: 2019-04-13 01:41:21
Then by that logic you’d have to say dollars are a risk too? Bitcoin is less risky than dollars in my opinion.

It won’t be mined out into like 2140. But that doesn’t even matter. Wealth gets distributed as production of real goods causes holders of bitcoin to spend there bitcoin for real goods. Obviously the miners and first adopters with the most bitcoins will be able to buy the most goods.
I don’t see your logic behind why when bitcoin creation stops, its value would drop? All it would do is put a halt to its inflation rate making its stock to flow ratio basically infinite , meaning it would be the scarcest asset on the planet. The only possible way to get bitcoins would be from someone else through trade.

Financial institutions soul purpose will be providing loans and matching investors with investees. With the transparent nature of bitcoin, I don’t see a firm who practices fractional reserve banking, meaning a bank who loans out more bitcoins than it has, surviving in a competitive market. It would just add risk to its customers by doing so.
Financial industries today incur basically 0 risk because they are able to lend out more than they have, and if the loans get defaulted, the central bank bails them out. This allows them to take on risky loans, meaning higher profits, without the downside of default risk. A bitcoin backed currency, or even bitcoin itself would not allow banks to behave this way. Any loan that was defaulted is at a loss to the bank and not the tax payer. 
I recommend reading The Bitcoin Standard, if your actually interested in learning why bitcoins value went up so much and will continue to go up. It will do you a lot more good than seeking answers on Reddit.

I think bitcoin will be used for lending. Banks won’t be able to lend out more bitcoin than they have, like they do with dollars, and they will face higher default risk with the loans they do lend as they won’t be able to get bailed out. Definitely will be a thing though if bitcoin takes of as a scalable reserve currency.

You still believe in your TA? Lmao

It’s a global phenomenon, anyone country which tries to regulate it will be at a disadvantage to those that don’t.

What’s your stop loss
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:02:28
Well when I bought at 1400, the price has yet to go below. Good thing I didn’t use your advice or I’d still be waiting for 1200! Ha!
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:45:52
what happens if the next time it drops 1200-2500 the price is 10k higher? Bad advice.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:17:09
because you're short sighted?

Nice save, real smooth
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:56:41
Your TA is clearly garbage
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:56:28
Looks like your losing lol
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:15:59
I don’t think you understand how bitcoin works tbh
@_date: 2019-05-31 23:04:02
Why 80k

You prob listen to Tone Vays. You sound like you do. So use his advice. If you're a long term holder the best time to buy is yesterday.
