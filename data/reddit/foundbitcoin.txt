Bitcoin is not a credit card. So yes only people with savings will be able to spend it. Not a problem for the success of BTC/LN

I can totally relate to that. My wife and I had a total of 5 tries. The first ones were free on the NHS. For the other tries we had to pay. We started also PGS for the embryos. We did a total of 4 egg collections because in egg collection 2 and 3 all embryos had genetic abnormalities. Egg collection number 4 produced finally 2 non abnormal embryos. One of them implanted, my wife is now pregnant in week 17. Bitcoin helped financing this. I am very thankful for that. If the baby is a boy we will call him Satoshi as a middle name (my wife said yes to my suggestion). Message me if you want to talk, it has been a very tough time for me and my wife

In the stock world prices adjust in minutes. The +1k was the correct reaction, but it took too long. Well done that you bought at ATH

maybe the order books were thin, also it was a massive whale order of 152 BTC :)

I would not do any prediction about the hard fork, there are some scenarios which will shoot up BTC to 10k. In any case in a big correction I will be a buyer of BTC
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:15:01
not cashing out... 
maybe at 20k I would sell 10%
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:24:12
Yes I am prepared to load more BTC

I hope this time for good. And beyond 20
