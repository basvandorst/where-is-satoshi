Considering how many people are still waiting on a return of investment, I do feel kinda rich. My first ASIC paid itself off and bought 3 more, before the fall. Eh, at least I didn't lose money.

I have a line of shot glasses coming out that are more discreet, lol
I know what you mean, though. My wife gets this glazed look whenever I say the B word. :)

I'm bringin' it back!

I have always been an ebay guy... But why not? It'd be new to me, but that's the way to further the cause!
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:08:51
Ebay has always been my go to marketplace. If I get a greatly positive, or greatly negative response from there, I may expand outward. Thanks for the idea though. I may do that.
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:03:16
lol, you may be right. I was going for the counter culture angle with that one, but it might be "too soon". I definitely wouldn't be making a lot of "I got goxed" images. :P
@_date: 2015-08-07 04:15:48
Thank you. It's nice to get some positive feedback. Imgur.com ripped everything I put up to shreds, lol
@_date: 2015-08-07 04:17:34
I'm getting ready to put some shot glasses up on ebay... You should get one of those. That way, even if he doesn't like it, you always have one reserved when you visit. :)
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:07:32
Here is me putting together one of the products. The last image is a last minute addition. I put a reverse, upward facing bitcoin logo on the bottom of the glass, so you can see it as you drink.

They are stickers, but the die cut vinyl variety. I find they last longer, and the raised topography of multi color designs gives a pleasing texture. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 04:15:12
I am, indeed. If you search for "Bitcoin Vinyl Art" on ebay, all the various glass styles come up. And you can get any of the 20 supplied images put on them.
They're starting at 7.99 for a pair; free shipping.
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:01:43
Yeah, I can do that. I was leaving it open so I could put any of the logos on any of the glasses. You can see my portfolio at  but I would be happy to make a couple samples.

I'm going to put these on some beer glasses in vinyl to make some money and promote the cause, so helping out is just fine.  Let me know if you have any ideas, cause this is sort of what I do.  I like the barter system too, so let's trade some things.  😊

this is (holds fingertips an inch apart) soooo close to being perfect. If only they didn't expire. Thank you for the mention though.
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:21:48
Ah, I didn't even think of paper wallets! My one concern is if a person has one of these preloaded paper wallets, can they get at my other coin? Or is it limited to just what's preloaded on it?
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:16:30
I might be able to use this as a workaround, thank you very much for the nod to it's existence!
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:38:03
...is a service I alllllmost used for an idea I had. What made it bad for me, is that while you can generate a set amount of bitcoin and use it as a "tip" with a physical token, it expired after a month.
Since it does expire, all you'd have to do is send out an image or printout of the tip card, and if a person doesn't use it, it automatically comes back to you.

Would you believe that my sticker company was instrumental in funding my first ASIC purchase? 
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:09:05
Exactly! Competition is good for the consumer. Plus we're both supporting the cause. Any profit is just frosting.  (...Is my hopeful outlook) :-) 
@_date: 2015-08-23 10:13:57
agreed. Welcome to bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-07-21 03:48:33
This may be it. My only concern is that technically, I will have had access to both keys. I want to help foster use of a system that is built on trust, and show that it can be trusted. If I've got a hand in their wallet, so to speak, I don't know how I can do that. 
So close.
So it sounds like either an untrustworthy long term solution, or a trustworthy short term one.

I put up some designs: a few gathered, a few original. 
I would be proud to wear any of these
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:32:29
I was wearing a bitcoin tshirt one day, and the cashier said "oh, bitcoin, I've heard about that" So while I was in a hurry, I couldn't pass up the chance to plant a seed, so to speak. I opened with a comparison to paypal, and how it was basically internet money. She nodded, but when I got overzealous and stated that it would eventually replace money in general... Lost her right then and there. People are going to have to use it to understand it. In the same way that in general, the public has no idea how credit transactions really work, they will use it when it's useful and easy.

So since satoshi is supposed to be a group or otherwise unknown person, who is supposed to accept the prize? Are the proverbial "they" trying to lure out whoever created the blockchain? And worse, what if it's Karpeles!?! :D

That's what I did after my first miner ROI'd... Back when I was lucky to have that happen. As the bits accumulated, I'd let one miner pay for the next and so on, until my electricity got too expensive. Still, I didn't lose anything, and I just watch my last .3 fluctuate. :)
