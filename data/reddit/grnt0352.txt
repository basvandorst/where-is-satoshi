This kid wrote a two and a half page opinion piece involving emerging technology and monetary theory and his teacher punishes him?  As much as I'd like to debate monetary policy with this person, the more objectionable point is that she was a gigantic, unprofessional, dick to a ten year old.

I noticed there's not really a mapping function to allow renters to sort properties by convenient location.  Location is easily the biggest criterion I have when selecting apartments, so I rely heavily on Craigslist and Zillow (mostly the former).  You might consider integrating a map so that users can explore neighborhoods around their workplace or other hotspots, or, alternatively, partnering with one of the aforementioned sites.

I believe there's a daily processing fee that's passed along from the recipient bank.  I've been told it's about $0.15/day, but I've forgotten what's it's called.

I'll be honest.  This is the first wide fluctuation I've seen where people *weren't* losing their shit.  Remember the suicide hotline being stickied?

As do I.  Nothing but good things to say about the business.
