Coming from the Dogecoin sub, I found the responses on this post to be pretty awesome. Can't help but think much of any animosity that exists between Doge and Bitcoin is due to a few jerks trying (and failing) to play both camps against one another

UK has just recognised cryptos in general as a form of currency... keep them fingers crossed!

We do have our bad days as well. Trolling and the like. But there are a lot of good people, always vigilant, and we're learning to handle good and bad times both.

Thank you :)
You just brought a little ray of sunshine into my day :v

Well tbh if wikipedia took donations with a certain other crypto which shall not be named I'd gladly donate, great publicity

Those are wonderful things, but life isn't just a competition to be mr nice guy. This is a big moment for us, I contributed 1337 doge to that fund, lol. +8.0085 doge (hope tipping here is okay)

Haha. You cheeky monkey! :P
I'd say it's not marketed aggressively, so much as enthusiastically :P

Great point. It seems to me (as a dogecoin native) that there are a lot more of them. If this thread was on it would be filled with random tips. The low price is good so I (hopefully) don't take myself too seriously
+8.0085 doge

Bitcoin is for money as:
+ iTunes was for HMV
+ Netflix was to Blockbuster
+ Amazon was for Waterstones

He was messing with OP. The lesser of people need to knock others down in order to feel big themselves. OP wasn't arrested for saying the word bitcoin, he was screwed around with because the security guy saw a lack of social bearings, someone who might not be able to defend himself, and lacked the tact to ignore it.
The correct response would surely be something along the lines of "I have no idea what you are doing, but I am extremely concerned. Are you accusing me of illegal activities? These are very serious allegations. Who is in charge here? Who do you work for? I want to speak to your supervisor. Where is he? The airline is going to be hearing from me about this, [name of jackass], I came here to catch a plane, and I have done nothing wrong. The level of professionalism in your behaviour is shocking. Is this how customers are treated here? I will be lodging a complaint, [name of jackass], and I will follow it up" - pause while he realises that his actions may have negative consequences -
The key is that you take control of the 'frame'
I would then gauge my response on how the employee responds to this, but if you stand up for yourself, (if you are not just merely posting this to cause rustle jimmies) then people like that should leave you alone, and you won't feel bad after this kind of interaction.
**tl;dr** stand up for yourself, and people dick you around less. Most people act on base instincts, that are like algorithms, which can be learned and used to your advantage.
Also: sadly people like that are not interested in reason

It's a poor precedent that has been set. That needs to be changed

You'd think when the PM used drugs himself, and his predecessor, the POTUS, his predecessor and the one before him they'd be all for it, since they're all doing it themselves. Guess not though :/

Fellow shibe... please don't taunt our bitcoin friends. They are smart good techy people mostly. It's not a competition, plenty of room for crypto in this world. \^.^

Haven't laughed like that in a long time :3
