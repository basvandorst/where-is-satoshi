I used premire, I dont think its ideal for this but it was just to see how it looked. I think it looks ok for my first try.

we were due for a correction for a bit now. I think its still going to drop down to 10k ish in the next couple days. then big slingshot back above 20k, hope im wrong about another dip. But its a cycle of this thing, happened 5 times this year where we had a 30-35% correction.

just noticed I started the clip at the wrong spot.. sorry guys kinda new to this :/
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:03:34
its really simple! First you put in $100 into it, then check back in a week and it should be worth $30

in case people dont know, USAA are for veterans and active military, plenty of the younger crowd and old retired folks with money to invest
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:55:49
the real talent would be the guy who has been holding from 20k lol!

I was a big fan of USAA until they refused to replace my car keys that were stolen from my gym locker. someone broke in and took my things, I had full coverage and companies like AAA would of replaced the keys, but USAA said its not covered for some reason :/ usually you expect FULL COVERAGE to cover EVERYTHING including those little things that you know, start the fucking car..

No gyms will never cover anything u get stolen even if someone cut your lock off and took things right in front of the manager they really don’t care. As for the keys it’s to my vw gti. Key fob alone was $400+ and programming another $250, ofcourse my car had issues and needed further work and keys never got programmed. So I’m out $600+ for keys and still need to pay out of pocket to get things worked on. All which would of been easier for me to pay a deductible for $500. I mean, this is what I thought I paid the extra for full coverage for. Incase something like this happened, guess not

Why are the rounds key-holing? Either you poked holes with a pen or you need a new barrel

@_date: 2019-10-03 18:54:38
So the less you profit the more they take? Sounds like a bank to me
@_date: 2019-10-18 06:03:09
Why do people always feel the need to tell everyone. Keep it to yourself, people don’t care about your magic internet money lol, but seriously most people could care less about BTC, I tend to not badger them about it if they’re not interested. Some friends laughed at me too so I don’t bring it up. I HODL and wait.

I meet a guy a while back who deployed to Iraq, he was running a money operation where he would wash $5 bills and print $100 on it. he said hes in the process of writing a book called "95% profit". turned out he only got caught because his crackhead sister in law rated on them. printed something around $200k+ worth
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:23:48
can you buy stuff with it? and resell it to drastically lower your taxes? buy a $220k lambo, sell it for 200k, lose 10% but better than 50% isnt it?
@_date: 2019-10-12 19:53:23
Make sure to always screen shot exactly how much you have, and let everyone know any personal information. That’s always a good start
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:07:59
you mean more like 250 BTC after you cash out and get taxed :(
@_date: 2019-10-04 03:36:11
Watch it dump back down to 8k and say goodbye to any profits cause I’m too patient to cash out

Charts are usually a measure of price and the real professionals don’t like to give a time line, will 16k come? Yes, when? NOT October, but 16k will still happen
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:38:26
not paper.. cotton.. at least get it right
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:39:21
coooooooottttton :D
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:13:40
that indicator shows how the market sentiment is. Most people are selling.
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:11:22
First off it’s just Bitcoin.. no need to say “core” unless you’re taking to a bch potato
@_date: 2019-04-27 07:43:05
Money is name of cotton

It’s looks like homer in the fishbulb episode from the simpsons

As a designer, I think it looks great! My input would be to make the area where the btc amount is print, flat. It was tricky to see the amount is for “.1 btc”and not “1 btc”
Your design has several dots around and near the decimal. Making a flat area to print would clarify things. Just my two sat

Curious how many electronics I can plate in bitcoin to achieve better conduction
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:41:31
obvious manipulation is obvious  
@_date: 2019-01-09 10:31:47
Isn’t that the equivalent of someone who counterfeits money claiming its real? Lol
@_date: 2019-01-09 08:34:06
wouldnt bitcoin forks like BCH be considered counterfeits? 
@_date: 2018-03-25 01:13:50
the thing is, who actually held from back then? most people sold long ago and re bought in. even know, people dont hold too long :/ takes a lot of discipline to hold during down trends
@_date: 2019-01-25 01:24:57
Plot twist. Patient is really in a insane asylum imagining bitcoin eventually pulled out of the bear marker 
@_date: 2019-09-18 03:52:48
nice interface, what app is this???
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:19:04
I remember when my family and I left Argentina at 6 years old, the dollar/peso were about 1:1 if not the peso was slightly higher. Last time I visited for 2 weeks, markets were selling 1 USD for 11 Peso. By the time I got back from my trip I was lucky to get $1 for 15 Pesos
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:00:09
how are you getting it to look like this? mine looks like it did 2 years ago just a list :/
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:37:18
my best guess: its probably the best way to link BTC accounts to names, and for the gov to see whos not paying taxes
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:11:10
Dropping 80% isn’t considered bullish lol! Kewl edit doe
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:12:29
You’re retarded? Remember that guy who spent 10k btc on pizza? What about that other guy who chucked 7k btc in the dump? Or all those people who invested in bitconeeeeeect
