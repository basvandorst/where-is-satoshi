Bittorrent required napster to fail to take off; Spotify required bittorrent to succeed to take off (and create enough leverage for Sean Parker to push labels into evolving to meet the growing challenges they faced with piracy eating away at old revenue streams)... Everything is about timing in the end.
Facebook and other tech giants do not exist in a technological vacuum, nor are they necessarily against decentralised, open source solutions.  Coders have always shared code and ideas freely.  It's how things like Facebook got built afterall.
The problem has been one of how we fix an internet that has been existing in a medieval world powered by advertising, where people's lives are seen as nothing more than bits of data to be profited from.
That's the challenge everyone in this industry faces this year, and it's very exciting to finally see a way out toward the light; where everybody (including Facebook) can come out 'winning' when they embrace the changes ahead and get behind ideas borne of collaboration over competition.

The way I see it most people in the West who truly understand what this community needs are happy to hold onto their coins.  They recognise they're very very early adopters involved in a technology that is as transformative as the internet itself.
Patience is needed, and those that aren't computer scientists or engineers should just step out of the technical debate unless they feel they can add something.  In which case Reddit isn't the place to do that, the peer reviewed Linux Foundation dev mailing list, GitHub, IRC and the BIP (bitcoin improvement proposal) system is the place to do that.
If we want the best for Bitcoin we ought use Reddit for public outreach; sharing news and information that can help the masses catch up on the last 9 years they've missed, teaching them the basics in security and the social side behind all this.
For those computer scientists in here wishing for the tech to move faster (who think they could help) then reading and understanding the many whitepapers around sidechains, lightning network and the various initiatives going on in sidechain elements alpha, would be the best way of truly informing the trajectory of all this in a proactive manner.
For those excited but without the knowledge, may I recommend [codeacademy]( as a great introduction to programming.  One of the best things you can do with your brain is learn how to code; it's a skill that will greatly improve your life, and not just career prospect wise... the logical and rational discipline required to understand programming, can be applied to all kinds of everyday situations.
If none of that is your kinda' thing then there are plenty of other skills needed in this amazing project (design, art, administration, forum moderation, local community outreach).  
And if all that sounds too much hassle, simply HODLing and focusing on the light is the very best thing you can do to help secure your investment in this, and in doing so, keep us all moving forward.

If you grew up in the 90s as a computer nerd (during the home computer revolution) and you were reading sci-fi back then, you regularly time traveled into the future via those great works (Isaac Asimov's works, for instance, predicted the internet).  The games we played had us being captains of starships, economic strategists, town mayors, aircraft pilots; strategy and adventure games taught us about wargaming and complex puzzle solving.
It was inevitable then when dreaming about what the future might look like (and what might go wrong) that when these nerds eventually found each other on the early internet that they'd begin rebuilding the world anew and making a lot of that science fiction they read, science fact.
The fallout comes when those free radicals go head to head against an old guard that weren't brought up on any of that.  Even worse when the vast majority of the population (and their leaders) know very little about science and technology.
Those 'time travelers' then end up looking as crazy as our great ocean fairing ancestors who were the first to realise the Earth isn't flat.  Imagine being part of 0.01% of the population who could read and write, chart the oceans, understand trade and speak multiple languages.  
And so, just as those great captains had to wait for the world to learn to read and write, so do we wait for a less cynical, more tech savvy younger generation to form the rear guard as that older generation (who thought computers were a passing fad) stop fighting change (and their children) and finally retire from the game board... taking solace in the fact they taught their children just enough to figure out how to one day free humanity from a system that has reached its natural end.
The players may have changed but all this has all happened before.  It is the neverending story of life and it's been going on since time began.
In all that is the realisation we are *all* time travelers, living in a universe comprising ideas and thought forms that are unbounded by conventional notions of time and space.  And it is those thought forms that make the future.
If you can imagine a more beautiful future in your mind (as satoshi did), and effectively convey that future vision to people in the present (who are willing to help you realise it) then congratulations, you *are* a time traveler.

Don't forget the second programmer on bitcoin was Mike coding in his 20% time.  I don't think the world is lacking good coders willing and excited to contribute, it's just perhaps they're a little shy coming forward and/or assume you all have everything you need?

Sure, if that's your view.  But it was the DoA comment we are refuting here, not the various merits of Ethereum's longterm viability.
Further, Rootstock != Ethereum.  Indeed, it's possible to run Ethereum contracts *on* rootstock.  
And regardless what you may think of either of the technologies, the amount of skills being learnt in these spaces and jobs being created, is a boon for bitcoin longterm since, however all this may play out, those disciplines (and indeed code) will be absolutely transferrable.

Not so different to when Travel Agent package tours offered the same thing.  
Fortunately, things like Couchsurfing and BlahBlahCar allow people to find authentic experiences that embrace the sharing economy, and the lonely planet forums are a Godsend.  
There is no doubt that social media and all that sharing of those experiences has brought humanity closer together by allowing people to 'store' lifelong friends in off-cerebral storage for later retrieval, which has allowed younger generations to go way beyond Dunbar's number in terms of friendship circles.  
Crucially though, social media has shown us just how beautiful (and similar) all people and nations are.
None of this is that dissimilar to filofaxes and business cards in the old world.  Or those Uncles and Aunts that would come back with a million slides from their adventures abroad to show the family at Christmas via the projector.  
We are story tellers, we like to share experiences - that's why we invented the camera and the movie reel and then the hyper-connected digital version of all those things.  Things will get even weirder of course, when VR and AR actually *takes* us to those people and places in realtime ;)

I've seen a million posts like this dating back to the inception of all this.
At the moment people are just bored because there's no rollercoaster euphoria to post about.  And so they resort to water cooler gossip because they don't feel they have any other way of making an impact.  Which is a shame, because we all have a proactive role we can play in helping spread awareness.
As with the last series of dramas, these will soon fade into bitcoin history and then there will be another episode in the soap opera to deal with.  
Absolutely nothing has changed with the underlying technology itself, and compared to where we were say, 5 years ago, things have never looked rosier.

It's an addiction like any other.  Facebook, YouTube, Reddit; just tools like radio and TV that came before.  They can be used for good or ill (just like bitcoin).   
In the 60s we had rockstars throwing TVs out of hotel windows, in the 80s comedians like Bill Hicks warning of "56 channels of American Gladiators".  
At the end of the day it's up to individuals to navigate all this and find their place outside the echo chambers.  Just as you can choose to watch the discovery channel on cable TV over the entertainment channel, you can choose to use the internet to learn about the world and connect with people who will enrich your experiences for the better, or you can choose to 'waste' your time in a fake plastic world of cheap entertainment and celebrity gossip.
Many of the problems online - as with the degradation we saw with TV and the newspaper industry - came with advertising hijacking content.  
But there's plenty of light on the horizon: Reddit, Google+, YouTube, the actual communities and events run by groups within Facebook, are all helping to bring the world closer together.
It's never been easier for youngsters to crowdfund an idea, make their own YouTube show, or travel the world snapping photos that years ago would have required oodles of money and in-group contracts.
Have faith we'll all get there.  If there were no big problems to solve in the world, what would be the point in it all eh?

Ok let's take a step back.  
Bitcoin is growing up.  With bitstamp and coinbase adding upwards of 100,000 users a day, it is now becoming mainstream.  People are flocking to bitcoin as a means to shield their assets and personal wealth.  Millennials, for the first time in their lives, are now able to save money and pay back student debts.
It is no longer a good choice for darkmarkets and the 'grey' economy.  In fact, owing to its public ledger, it really never was.  If your business revolves around that kind of market then fine, but pivot to Monero or ZCash which are more privacy oriented.  
With LN channels enabling better privacy, Layer 2/3 may prove more beneficial to you, but again, you're going to have to have patience, and in the meantime work with what you have. 


Nopes, the open source nature of this project is what created r/btc.  And I support their right to do it.  They have a different philosophy, different (business focused) principles and different ideas on how to solve the world's problems.  I think they've largely missed the point of bitcoin's longterm utility, but that's OK.  Similarly, ZCash and Monero and Ripple and CarbonCoin have different ideas (and the same right to fork the code and go try them).  If you threw all those people, ideas and big personalities into the same group, nothing at all would ever get done because of all the differing opinions and inevitable oneupmanship that comes with that.
Bitcoin does not exist to solve your business problems, any more than the internet does.  It is a rapidly evolving tool and technology in its infancy.  Those behind it can see where it all leads, just as we could all see the impact Napster / Mpeg / Bittorrent / HD Streaming would have on the internet long before the rest did.  Of course, for those things to evolve, the internet backbone had to evolve first (can't stream a HD video at 3.5kb/s).  We had to be patient for those things; from Napster&gt;Spotify took 10 years.  
We're 9 years into Bitcoin.  In a years time, I highly doubt you will even recognise this space; just as the internet of today was unimaginable just 10 years ago prior to Youtube, Twitter, Facebook and the many other Web 2.0 sites and services that now define it.  
 
HODL in there buddy. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:17:30
The most important thing for people in countries suffering from massive inflation and corrupt/broken economic regimes is that Bitcoin serves as a trusted source of value storage that can shield assets that would otherwise be rapidly depreciating.  It is not, yet viable as a cheap payment instrument for basic goods.  Every single other alt suffers the same scaling dilema btw, once it gains the kind of mainstream adoption that bitcoin has.  Which is why off-chain scaling that will cater to (eventually) billions of transactions per second is the only longterm solution.  We can prove that btw, with science :p
We also forget that many merchants outside the West still run on a bartering/trust based economy.
They are far more willing to give store credit notes and maintain LETS style databases (as we see arising in Greece).  In such a scenario it is not necessary to have every single purchase in bitcoin go through the merchant, but rather credit balances are settled on a weekly and sometimes monthly basis. 
Of course, as in the West, LTC is proving an accessible and viable means to do those cheap transactions, which is perhaps reflected in the insane price increases, which in turn, is helping move more economic energy to those places and people in desperate need of our help.
The Pineapple Fund and other philanthropic initiative coming from this community is also pushing economic aid out there.
In the meantime, Ethereum and Bitcoin is being used by the U.N via initiatives like the World Food Programme to build systems capable of alleviating the issues that come with TX fees.  Rootstock, LN, will further streamline these.  The smart contracts governing these systems (currently running over ethereum) may be ported to rootstock and they've been built in such a decentralised way that they would outlive even the collapse of the U.N itself. 
Of course all of this was foreseen; we only have to listen to people with a very deep understanding of technology (like Chamath Palihapitiya) talking back in 2013:
"Are you going to trust the chain that's been running for 9 years (and subject to strict peer review) and, as such, has proven itself anti-fragile and resistant to every attack or when borne of vested business interests?
If you believe you might have anything truly useful to offer to the discussion, why not join the IRC groups and dev mailing lists, or start submitting Bitcoin Improvement Proposals?  Or, why not author some whitepapers and submit them to organisations like the UN?
You could even apply to join Amir Taaki's hacker academy in Barcelona (he's not just looking for coders).  He is a person in this space that has actually been on the ground in places like Syria and Argentina, working really hard to understand the problems they face.
Here's his talk on all that, at HHCP17 Congress earlier this year:
Of course it's not for you or I (or any business) to decide where this technology will go, or which blockchain will become humanities most trusted.  That will be for *ordinary people* to decide.
Although, I would venture it will be the blockchain that remains most anti-fragile and has a 9 year history of proving time and time again, that through rigorous peer review and calm, rational upgrades, it will be *the* blockchain most people will actually trust to register the sale of their house or company and, yes, eventually (through sidechains) their retail purchases.
I will be humble enough to acknowledge that I cannot foresee into the future any more than you can.  For now, I am immensely proud of everything this community has achieved together, and very happy with how things are going. 
And I look forward to hearing more initiatives like the Pineapple Fund that show the world just what this amazing group of nurturers can do with this even with the technology at such an early stage.

The only thing that has come before that Bitcoin is comparable to is the Internet Dotcom Boom.  
In this respect, Bitcoin (the money protocol) can be likened to the Internet (the information protocol).  Had the world wide web concept been patented and the Internet IPO'd you would have seen a similar meteoric rise in price... Your shares in that game changing technology would have been largely unaffected by the dotcom crash and today you would be sitting pretty.
To understand this requires months of research and a clear understanding in computer science and technology.  Even those most knowledgeable in this space, will tell you it's nearly impossible to keep up with the pace of innovation, just as it was nearly impossible to keep up with all the world wide web developments.  
The crux of the problem with commentary and talking heads in this space is when traditional investors and finance 'experts' are rolled out to speak on it, without understanding the technology well enough yet to see the nuances between altcoins, ICO's and various infrastructure services that are appearing around the Bitcoin money protocol.  
So... sure, you can liken altcoins to penny stocks, ICO's to ponzi's and those infrastructure services (exchanges etc.) to dotcoms.  But none of those things affect Bitcoin - The Money Protocol, that serves as the backbone to all that.
Remember it was the dotcom boom and crash we experienced, not the Internet Protocol crash.
And don't forget those same old skool finance talking heads had this to say about the internet.
*"By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's.”* — Paul Krugman 
In the end, we can only hope to expose ourselves to the greatest range of information and knowledge in this space, listen to the people who know the technology (and have been here before) then be confident enough in our understanding to be able to think for ourselves.

There's plenty of well loved companies in this space who haven't implemented segwit.  
Let's lose the tinfoil hats and appreciate for a moment the crazy risks coinbase have taken to be the only company with enough of their shit together in America (alongside Gemini) able to pull all this off under the insane regulatory environment out there.
Most companies moved to the UK / Japan and other places more supportive of bitcoin.
The coinbase API and UX is stunning and the fact they've been able to cope with the insane numbers of signups is something they should be applauded for.  Compare this to, say, Kraken (who haven't had to deal with any such pressure) and, well, there's no contest.  
Bitcoins success this year coinbase have played an important role in.  One might even argue their 'neutral ish' stance in the whole B2X drama at least put a rocket up everyones arses, which ultimately pulled the group closer together and showed the world how we are able to deal with all kinds of external pressures effectively.  Which, of course, made bitcoin stronger.
It's worth remembering also that Bitcoin != Coinbase nor is it run by American interests.  Its destiny as a global technology that will prove to be as important as the internet itself, does not revolve around what any of these companies do.  
That destiny is being forged by the armies of coders silently working on Layer 2/3 tech and companies like Google, AirBnB, Ebay and the myriad Y-Combinator startups who are also taking their time to get this right.  And most importantly, the people that will actually want to use the things they build with all this.
Yes those companies are taking their time to see how this all evolves; perhaps because many are acutely aware of all the mistakes made building the internet.
Of course most of the people working on those things aren't the vocal minority we will find on twitter and reddit since, well, they're actually *working*.

This whole luck thing is a state of mind, which is why I linked you to the [Science of Luck]( piece.  Ironically, the fact you didn't follow it would put you in the batch in that study that consider themselves "unlucky".
It's all about taking your time to spot opportunities, getting to know people without expecting anything out of them.  Taking your time, working hard yes, but mostly enjoying the time you don't have to work and spending it around people who look at life like a beautiful adventure.
Have a goal in your mind maybe it will be "I want to live in Australia for a year of my life".  Then leave it there.  Don't force the thing to happen, instead appreciate the things that are already good in your life and be happy with your lot.  Always in the back of your mind you will have that Australia goal then one day *poof* an opportunity to realise that dream presents itself.
Then, it's about taking a risk, and going out of your comfort zone.
At least that's the way I look at things.  Your reality is yours though, and it's not for me to tell you how all this works, it's something we have to figure out ourselves I guess...  FWIW: I didn't listen to my elders when I was a young teenager when they tried to explain all this either, and it all worked out OK in the end :D

Bear in mind Chamath - like many of us here - is currently operating under BST (Bitcoin Space Time).  As such, all BC (Before Coin) time references need to be adjusted accordingly.  
Whilst astro physicists at CERN are still trying to unravel the enigma that is BST, we can make a rough "back of lunar napkin" estimate based on rudimentary kindergarten moonmath: 






This phenomenon is of course the *only* way to explain how massive software engineering projects like the lightning network are actually running ahead of schedule :)
Odd as it may seem, for those currently under the influence of BST those 1.53846153846 years cited above will actually feel like 20 (hence all the "what a long year that month was" posts we have seen of late).  So in that respect, both estimates are accurate, since our experience of the passage of time is entirely subjective anyhoo.  
Many argue this strange timewimey dilation effect is due to the rapid increase in the speed of information transmission via the interwebz, whilst others argue there is a direct correlation between BST acceleration and the rate of increased production we are seeing coming out of decentralised meme factories.

IIRC, the word 'meme' was first coined by Richard Dawkins to refer to "ideas that are passed from one brain to another".  He was able to demonstrate how certain species of birds are able to pass on memes in this way.  
Crows, for instance, will place hard to crack nuts under car wheels in standing traffic and then come back after the wheel has broken it open.  This action is then copied by other crows.
The human pastime of cigarette smoking was something that spread through the West in a similar fashion.  
Popular music, movies, books, all ripple through society through the memetic effect, as do the constantly changing societal codes of conduct that bind us together.
Nearly every human made thing we see around us (material and abstract) was, at some point in time, just someones idea.  Usually those ideas were written in books or carried through music and the arts.
In todays globally connected information rich world, ideas can spread at practically the speed of light... A single tweet can start the Arab Spring, a shared article can lead to a global protest movement arising from nowhere...
Internet memes that go viral are therefore as powerful as any carefully orchestrated media campaign.  One might argue even more so since there is a certain amount of integrity that comes with ideas that are freely shared without an advertising budget backing it up.
Bitcoin is perhaps the greatest example in modern times of how one persons idea - if it is powerful enough - can sweep over the world and change the very fabric of our reality.
Perhaps with this understanding we can begin to fathom just why it was Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman (when asked why he turned down the $1m Nobel Prize fund for solving the Poinjere conjecture) remarked: "I can control the universe with my mind, why would I need a million dollars?" ;)

The bitcoin *protocol* and layer 2/3 tech is ultimately agnostic to those external companies who fail to 'level up'.  Those that do, will win user support, those that don't will fall behind.

Failure to understand this and to let go of the need to control, puts us in exactly the same mindset of those who failed to grok just how fast the internet would render old ways of doing business obsolete.
"Try streaming a DVD quality movie over the internet...  Hah!  As if *that's* ever gonna' happen." — some Blockbuster execs
We didn't get to where we are today with that mindset; we got here by constantly re-imagining the way *everything* works, including bitcoin itself.  It starts by questioning everything we hold as being 'true', and beginning each new encounter by asking "Why?" and "What if?"
In such an environment, there is very little room for negative thinkers afraid of change.  The best way of finding your place in all this (and peace amidst the chaos) is simply to just do good work and support others doing the same... then let the tide carry you, rather than trying to fight against it.

The fork happened in such a frenzied cloud of fight or flight, bch had very little time to think about it professionally yet alone develop a comprehensive branding and identity strategy.  Heck, the initial bitcoin cash site was built on WIX.  
I think as that fight or flight simmers down, bch can start thinking about those things and how their PR campaign of relentlessly attacking 'core' will keep backfiring.  Negative campaigning simply won't cut it in this open source world of collaboration.
And the same applies to ardent bitcoin core fanboys/girls too.  Everytime we see a Roger ver attack, or a sleight on bcash we see an old world borne of hate and tribalism rearing its ugly head doing its destructive thing... 
So, the sooner both 'sides' snap out of fight or flight and get on with collaborating and the sharing of mutually beneficial ideas... the sooner this entire space begins getting taken more seriously by the (fewer and fewer) crypto skeptics eager to enter.
Ultimately, there's no rush, figuring out how to get there does not ultimately effect the moral arc this technology is on, it just makes the ride less enjoyable for those that haven't yet figured out how to get along ;)

At the beginning of the internet (back in the days of green screen monitors and BBS boards) I remember my schoolteachers thought I was wasting my time reading computer books.  They would openly ridicule me in front of classmates, convinced, as they were, that computers were a passing fad.  
Try as I might, as I sat there looking at calculators on every desk, there was no explaining to them that computers were already in charge of the world.
Suck it up... You're an early adopter, the archetypal 'nerd'... the ridicule and naysayers come with the territory.  
Eventually, this technology will permeate the very fabric of our everyday world and we'll be as exquisitely dependent on it as we are the internet and computers today.
As all that becomes self-evident to the masses, be prepared for the onset of their collective amnesia as those naysayers that once labelled you a fool will literally forget they ever opposed any of this.

Sean "A million dollars ain't cool, you know what's cool? A billion dollars" Parker is also undergoing a WTF moment it seems.   
[Ex-Facebook president Sean Parker: site made to exploit human 'vulnerability'](
Also check out [his comments]( on billionaires becoming the new 'immortal overlords'.
The world will not go that way, any more than it went the way of those demagogues of the 80s who saw a future where we'd all be embedded with RFID chips that could be turned off if we 'did something wrong'.
**So what are the solutions?**
The way out will be through removing profit incentive; focusing on collaboration over competition and decoupling billionaire status from numbers in a bank account.
Jason Silva has [the right idea]( regarding the latter: "a billionaire should be someone who can positively impact the lives of a billion people".
In that future, if your company, idea or project can't demonstrably show it is doing good in the world, the crowd simply won't back it.  
We've been through all this before of course: it was the crowd (consumers) that stopped buying CFC fridges and aerosols in the 90s that eventually lead to us saving the ozone layer.  Those companies that didn't give a shit about the ozone layer went under.
Bitcoin enables us to turn the tables around on all this much faster and create a more fair and equitable world for all by removing "gatekeepers with good intentions" that might otherwise enslave us all.  With the ability of conscious companies now being able to expose their entire supply chain via the global bitcoin public ledger... millennials and other conscious consumer groups simply won't engage with companies that are shown to be doing harm.
Most companies (which are just *groups of people* with a common goal) will themselves be decentralised by all this, as will hierarchical governance structures.  
Layer 2 tech such as Blockstack will enable huge global web of trust style networks to evolve that are decoupled from gatekeepers, and ensure our data is no longer held (or sold) by untrustworthy entities.  
These entities will feed into company structures giving us trust ranks in much the same way we see Google feedback ratings for cafes and so forth.  Reddit karma, eBay seller ratings, AirBnB, Uber ranking etc. will all be fed into blockstack giving us bulletproof trust ratings married to real world identity on *our terms*, that are tamper proof and encrypted in such a way that we need not give away information to third parties we don't ourselves trust.
The amazing pineapple fund currently on the front page here is just one example of what the incredible group of wayseers that got into bitcoin from the beginning are capable of doing when we enable "permissionless altruism" to blossom.  Such drives are just the tip of the iceberg (only a tiny fraction of charities that are doing *real* good are yet to understand bitcoin).
Facebook (and many other web 2.0 'giants') have an important role to play in all this, and they seem to be aware that they also have a *lot* to fix.  The kinds of Layer 2/3 solutions currently being built give them the tools they need to tackle the problems Chamath highlights, as we transition to web 3.0; we'd be unwise to write Mark Z. and others off once they get onboard with the plan and find a way out of being beholden to advertisers and shareholders with less altruistic aspirations for where this technology might go.  
The most complex part for those gentle tech visionaries, has been convincing old world shareholders about all of this. 
 Fortunately though, bitcoin and the networks of collaboration it is now feeding, needs no such convincing... Especially when ordinary people get onboard and begin feeding their economic energy into these projects.
Those early believers in bitcoin - the idea, who have risked the most to get us thus far, can rest assured knowing that the moral arc of the bitcoin universe is exactly where it needs to be.

I have no more clue than anyone else why segwit has not been prioritised, and without any firm evidence one way or the other, will refrain from getting involved in the silly drama.  But the salient point is this:


So, as usual, bitcoin - the protocol - does not care for the silly zero-sum games humans think they are playing...  
Nor does it care much for armchair critics getting people all worked up over yet another drama that is going to subside (how many do we have to go through?).  
I for one, look forward to us getting back to the old days of tinkering with new ideas, and getting excited about the many beautiful things we can already build with all this.  That's when this subreddit really shines - and by extension -  bitcoin (an outlook which is nearly always reflected by the market itself).

It once took me two weeks to download Southpark the movie  through an IRC friend's FTP dump.  The UK didn't have residential broadband back then and I would have to wait a whole year before the movie was released in UK cinemas...  As such, 2 weeks constantly downloading over a 56k modem seemed like a small price to pay, given I was such a huge fan of the show.
At about the same time, Napster had changed the way we shared music.  Prior to that we either used FTP dumps or DCC file transfers via IRC.  It was clunky and cumbersome, but we did it anyhow because the payoff was worth the effort.
We could of course see that in good time, HD streaming and on demand music services like Spotify would be a reality, but that there would be many challenges to getting there, both technological and social...  
In the meantime, we did the best with what we had and enjoyed every minute of this new borderless cyberspace.  
Our conversations were about the beautiful adjacent possible of where this technology could go... This, of course, left very little time for complaining about things like download speeds ;)
It was a whole ten years on before those dreams crystallised in the form of Spotify and YouTube... When they arrived, did we stand still?  Nawww, the next adjacent possible unfolded, another set of dreams ten years away from reality.
TL;DR: We can get busy complaining about problems in the present, or we can get busy inventing (and championing) solutions capable of pulling us forward and overcoming those problems.  We can only do that by appreciating how far we have already come together and getting behind a unified future vision, just as we did at the beginning of all this before the current imperfections were even an issue.

Wouldn't read too much into any of this.  The general theme of the talk was "things that keep me awake at night", it included such things as youth unemployment.  He didn't say anything interesting other than "meh, not something we are tasked with dealing with."  
His advice was pretty good though and is not all that different to that espoused by many bitcoiners themselves.  Essentially "do lots of research, and understand that you're getting into something that is still at the experimental stage."

We don't need to look at this as a zero-sum wargame.  There is room for all the alts presently, including BCH.  Whilst I think their brute forcing and attacks on the bitcoin community has been pretty abhorrent there have been villains (and mob based mentality) on both sides revelling in the schadenfreude and angst. 
Best thing for bitcoin is to live and let live, have patience with one another and faith that the ecosystem will figure it out eventually.
Worrying about other alts is like worrying about r/buttcoiners back in the day.  Ultimately, the only way to prove naysayers wrong is to get on with improving the technology (and community) you support and care about.
That can be different things for different people, which is why bitcoin was created as an open source project to allow those groups to go run with the code under a different set of principles.  
In the end, atomic swaps will allow all these alts to work in tandem with the bitcoin blockchain anyhow, and it won't even matter what alt you are transacting in.  This is good news for small communities in say Africa, that may want to bootstrap their own alt that can piggyback bitcoin infrastructure.
BCH / Litecoin pose interesting solutions in the meantime whilst we await Lightning and Atomic Swaps - they provide a means for Layer 1 companies (bitpay etc.) to continue to onboard merchants that wish to use bitcoin as a retail payments network.  These companies are embracing Layer 2/3, so there's no need to panic about this.
Remember, we all came from the same (bitcoin) seed.  As such, we have [far more similarities than we do differences](

We can't on one hand champion core for prioritising safety and security of the protocol and user funds over rushed upgrades, and then criticise coinbase for doing the same thing.
Like it or not, the most important thing right now is they don't go the way of Mt. Gox.  Keeping user funds secure is paramount.  Second should be ensuring the site doesn't keep seizing up under heavy load (which rocks confidence in coinbase and the market itself).  
TL;DR: Perhaps give coinbase the benefit of the doubt and the oxygen they need to get this done right and let go of the need to see this constantly as an "Us vs. Them" 'fight'.  And appreciate you also have the option of exiting to another provider if you disagree with any of this (a luxury none of us had when we were at the mercy of Mt. Gox).
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:19:24
Yup, you are exactly right.  Ultimately, as with all great technologies, it comes down to two key things:
1. The platforms we build with bitcoin that ordinary folks want to use.
2. The people behind those ideas and platforms.  
In that respect, creativity, imagination and good old fashioned collaboration are more important than the intelligence of individuals or the 'bigger, faster, stronger' backbone running the technology.  After all there were plenty of competing internet protocols potentially superior to IP after the idea of the internet was unleashed upon the world.  Indeed, if we were to go back and rebuild it all, IPV4 would look nothing like it does today. 
Perhaps this is why:
*"We build our computer (systems) the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, on top of ruins." - Ellen Ullman*
As such, in the end it was the most open protocol, with the greatest diversity of imaginative minds intellectually and emotionally invested in its long term success, that thrived and captured the imagination of ordinary people wanting to play with it.  
This is why things like the DAOhub failed, even though (at least ostensibly) the technology platform was superior to say, discussing initiatives over bitcointalk or on IRC, and ethereum (which DAOhub was built on) was, arguably, technically superior to bitcoin. 
Rootstock, Blockstack, Sidechains, Drivechains, Lightning, MAST and myriad other Layer 2/3 'upgrades' address all those early bitcoin growing pains of course, but in a way that is slow, cautious and methodical, with working groups that have been together for nearly 9 years that, in many ways, mirror the way W3C shaped and continue to help shape the evolution of the internet.
None of us have a crystal ball and, as you say, time will tell.
In the meantime it's OK to not know for sure how it will all unfold, as long as we continue to enjoy the ride, and keep shaping this technology in a way that solves *real* problems that will improve the lives of billions of people across the planet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:55
Think about all that real world infrastructure that's been developing over the last 9 years (ATM's, Hardware Wallets, Bitcoin Debit Cards, all those merchants with those 'Bitcoin Accepted Here' signs...)
Bitcoin already has the network effect and, with bitsamp and coinbase announcing they're on-boarding up to 100,000 new users a day, is now reaching the point of mass adoption.  We can think of these companies currently providing an on-ramp for the less tech savvy, as we do AOL Online and Compuserve in the early internet days.
So the infrastructure is in place, but the internet of money is still very much at the email stage.
When Atomic Swaps go live (which have already been successfully tested the first LTC&gt;BTC swap happened just the other week)... What we will see is that anywhere that accepts bitcoin will be able to accept all of those other alts without the merchant (or ATM) even knowing you're using them.
I guess we could liken this to the invention of Wi-Fi... Suddenly you didn't need a fixed modem and a long ethernet cable to get the internet anywhere you go.  This is great, because it means none of those ATMs, Hardware Wallets, Bitcoin Accepted stickers have to change... They can be currency agnostic.  We might think of this as the second wave of bitcoin adoption, that altcoin ecosystem starts to make sense because it has the exact same real world utility as bitcoin does through the ability to piggyback the bitcoin network via these atomic swaps.
Great piece by Charlie Lee (Litecoin founder, ex-Googler / Coinbase tech lead), here explaining this vision:
[My Vision for LN with Bitcoin and Litecoin](
The third wave of adoption is the most interesting for me.  When all those sidechains start getting dev teams from Google, Ebay, Alibaba, AirBnB announcing their own versions of all this...  We can begin to see a world where, if you're a user of any of those services, you will automatically be able to transact in their tokens via atomic swaps.  We can imagine the value of those tokens being almost the same a stock price, and even a machine-payable world where billions of transactions per second are happening in realtime between, say, YouTube and Disney, everytime a video is streamed via the site.  
With the final settlement happening on the bitcoin blockchain, outside of those sidechains.
In that respect, the majority of alt coins as they stand today are really just a dry run for when this gets really serious and we see proper ICO's and large established tech companies announcing their integrations of this tech.
Ebay hinted just the other day, they are "seriously considering" adding bitcoin, but haven't yet figured out how all this fits in.  Likely, they are waiting, like many others, for this Layer 2/3 stuff to mature a bit more.

So twice the market cap of gold.  As Lloyd Blankfein said the other day "why does gold even have value other than the jewelry value we place on it?". Let's be honest, it's a pretty inconvenient and cumbersome store of value in comparison to bitcoin.  Moreover, gold scarcity is by no means guaranteed for a species on the brink of ascending to a type I civilisation status - your average asteroid is choc full of the stuff. 
For most of us who have been here a long time, predictions of 1k and 10k seemed crazy...  With that in mind, it seems 1 million is looking more and more likely as the network and infrastructure further matures.  
The fact that 16 trillion equates to the national debt is rather poetic.  One might even forsee a scenario where these imaginary numbers are simply wiped so we may start again, just as national debts were forgiven after WWII and countless times before during debt jubilees.
Let's just endeavour to do amazing things to make the world a better place when we get there, and not forget our humble beginnings.

How much have you actually paid in fees if you take all the price increases into account?
Whilst discussion is great, it would be more beneficial to the community at large if you can all leave the high level technical debates to the people with the actual computer engineering qualifications to debate them.
Causing a ruckus in here just slows down those actually solving these problems since they end up having to stop coding to deal with the disinformation.
Indeed, the very same people deriding economists for wading into bitcoin discussions without understanding the technology are the very same people proffering an opinion on scaling without even having read (let alone actually understood) things like the lightning network whitepaper.
Scaling *will* be solved, but like all grand projects of this size, it will take time.  
In the meantime, please focus on the positive things happening and be grateful for small mercies - such as the fact this thing has been running for 9 years without interruption, and that your funds are as secure as they were on day 1, thanks to the due diligence of the team doing the *actual* work on all this.

Lightning network payment channels will solve these issues.  
Litecoin, which has 5 minute confirmation times and lower fees, may also rise as a quick and easy payment solution for merchants, and will be able to operate in tandem with bitcoin via atomic swaps.  
Charlie Lee (Litecoin creator) wrote a nice essay on this vision earlier in the year:
Since he wrote that, the first atomic swaps have already been successfully tested and lightning network is ahead of schedule.  
The most important thing to understand about all this is not the technology but how closely the teams are interlinked.  Litecoin has been here since the beginning of all this (it was the first alt).  
Charlie and the Litecoin community have been incredibly supportive of bitcoin and implemented code (like segwit) on Litecoin in advance, to smooth the way forward for bitcoin developers.  
This, for me at least, tells us there is a terrific level of teamwork and mutually beneficial support networks that have evolved together over the last 9 years.  
I can think of no other alt pairs that operate in such a collaborative way.  
All that would make Bitcoin Gold 2.0 and Litecoin Silver 2.0. 
Perhaps ETH would get the Bronze 2.0 moniker if they can figure out a way of joining forces with lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:02:12
Good post.  Now let's see if there's a flipside to that coin(base) we might consider?
The stampede of new users coming in that erroneously see bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme has seen coinbase servers go down a number of times and record numbers of people signing up.  For anyone who witnessed the early 2013 Mt. Gox run-up, that saw the site buckling under the load, this rings alarm bells.
Many of the new people coming haven't the first clue about bitcoin or how to properly secure their coins - they just want in on the craze.  Anyone who has been in this for many years have perhaps observed this through the influx of messages from old friends desperate to get onboard (who are still unsure how to actually use any of this).  
Case-in-point: the other day, I found myself in a random taxi and - apropos to nothing - the driver struck up a conversation about Bitcoin and the various merits of Litecoin o_O, which was a real WTF moment for me (as someone who has all but given up talking about bitcoin to complete strangers).  The driver was the first to admit, he had no real clue about how to use any of this yet but felt it was definitely 'the future'.  Makes sense... many taxi drivers find themselves listening to the radio all day and it's all some shows have been talking about...
OK, so that's where we're at... the average Joe Public have just heard of email and are excited at the thought of sending an electronic message to their long lost Aunt in Australia, but they don't yet understand the basics of using an email client or ensuring their account is protected with a strong password...
Coming into bitcoin without knowing the basics is going to be bad for bitcoin in the longterm, last thing we want is that long lost Aunt accidentally firing off her lifetime savings into the hypervoid...  It's therefore incumbent on us all to nurture these new users and teach them about the responsibilities that come with actually being in charge of your own wealth... We *do not* want to get everyone hyped up about lambos and coming into this without doing the groundwork.
I hope coinbase will focus on putting some professional video primers together that teach all this to new users.  Perhaps they could even look into doing a deal with Trezor that would see new users getting a free hardware wallet with each purchase &gt; x amount.
Another reason the mania needs to be tempered: with the huge spike in new users, we risk overloading the protocol and the nascent ecosystem (coinbase included) that is still finding its way in all this.  Bitcoin and that ecosystem has come a *long* way this year - more than many of us could have dreamed - but we have much, much more work to do.
Bottom-line: regardless of the actual motives of coinbase in all this, by adding more and more alts to their platform they *are* giving bitcoin the oxygen it needs to keep growing, by allowing new users to spread their investments out across the altcoin market without throttling bitcoin in the process.
If coinbase are choosing a slow and cautious approach to scaling the rest of their tech to comply with Segwit, then perhaps we should be OK with that too.  It may turn out that prioritising alt support and keeping fees high (and thus coins more difficult to move) is the best thing they can be doing in the interim to defend against the stampede of new users?
Will all of that value stored in other chains mostly come flooding back into bitcoin as new users start to learn about the true value of bitcoin - the idea?  I'd say the chances are very high it will (in fact we witness that alt coin money flowing in all the time when market conditions change).  Is there a rush for all of this to happen?  
I'd argue, no.
I don't know any more than the rest of you of course, but coinbase is not the be all and end all of bitcoin... and in light of all the above, perhaps, just maybe, everything is as it should be ;)
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:54:33
Then take the exit option if that's how you feel and be grateful you have it.  Ultimately bitcoin - the idea, does not care about the talk of coinbase (or yours or mine) any more than it cared about the drama that surrounded Mt. Gox.

Thanks for the balanced perspective.
We have been through all this before many times with each new wave of adopters.  We were newbies once too predicting all kinds of waffle about bitcoin that, in hindsight, was flat out wrong.
After awhile that teaches you a certain amount of humility, and you learn to just stop trying to predict the outcome of all this... That wisdom (like your post above) you then pass onto the newbies, and then they pass it onto the next wave of adopters and on it goes...  
I guess the *key* thing to remember is no-one understands bitcoin (even those building it), just as those building the internet didn't understand that either.
In the end, we just gotta' embrace the chaos, have faith that it leads to a very beautiful place, but be OK with not knowing what that place looks like or how or when we will arrive.

This has been said of every advance in technology, from the printing press and farming equipment being smashed by luddites, to nuclear power that saw coal miners up in arms and the splitting of the atom that eventually lead to the Cuban missile crisis, to the internet scaring the crap out of the paperbelt era protectionists afraid of information wanting to be free, to bitcoin that had all the financiers in a tizz...   
But here's the thing.  The good guys and gals that actually invented those technologies (and therefore know them the best) thought very, very, very carefully about what they would do to the world wayyyy before they were unleashed... and, whilst it always seems to come close to the wire, and the vast majority of people ignorant of the technology get in a little bit of a panic (since we fear change more than we do destruction)... in the end... those good guys and gals who made it all, are always 10-30 years ahead of the rest... making backup plans for backup plans for backup plans... until change becomes self-evident and we all breathe a collective sigh of relief and wonder what all the fuss was about...

The protocol cannot be updated without consensus.  In the last 9 years there's been some 10,000+ techies from all over the world contributing to this project; with computer scientists and engineers peer reviewing every single line of code and idea (via Bitcoin Improvement Proposals).  
Nothing happens without everyone agreeing, which in some cases requires months of discussions, all of which are completely transparent and open to public scrutiny via GitHub, IRC, and the LinuxFoundation mailing lists. 
What's more, anyone is welcome to join the team; all that's required is a sound grasp of the *actual* technology and an ability to work well within this 'leaderless' (although I prefer the term leader*full*) environment, and an understanding that no one person or group can control (or decide the fate of) the technology or code.
This can often be a slow process because it requires so much due diligence, which can seem counter-intuitive to those who want to 'move fast and break things'.  That's a fine methodology for, perhaps, a young startup trying new things, but for protocol level code, 'breaking things' is not an option.  Fine to move fast and break things in a prototype sidechain, however, as this won't affect the integrity of the underlying bitcoin protocol (and the security of the value stored there) ;)
Should anyone disagree with the governance and peer-review model or the overall trajectory of the project, they are of course free to fork the open source code and go their own way and try shape their forked code in a different way (exactly as the many 1000's of alts out there have done).  
In fact, it is encouraged.  There is room for everyone in this space to co-exist, none of this has to be zero-sum ;)

Bitcoin is a global phenomenon that crosses all socio-economic strata and cultures and has many adoption use cases.  
The banks treating other people's money as casino chips to be gambled away is what lead to the *need* for bitcoin in the first place.  As such I have no interest in gambling sites and zero sum games.  I think part of the big problems we have in society are those companies that prey on others weaknesses and addictions (gambling being one of them).  Hence the rise of pay day loan companies with 4000% interest and the like.  
All of those old world businesses that simply exist to make numbers in a ledger go higher and care not for their social and environmental impact are, in my opinion, going to have to work really hard in this new world if they want to gain patronage from a crowd of increasingly savvy consumers.


I don't think 'spanking' devs is a good approach either, that's just a mirror of the old hierarchical governance systems lead by 'benign dictators' that bitcoin (and consensus based, decentralised 'leaderless' decision making) is also set to disrupt.
If your ideas cannot stand up to egalitarian scrutiny from a wide group of people (devs or otherwise) then perhaps the ideas simply aren't good enough.  One should not be afraid to be wrong and letting the wisdom of well informed crowds inform our views of the world.  Especially when those crowds have more domain expertise and experience than we do.  Some of the keenest entrepreneurs are the ones that speak last after listening to the entire groups opinion... and are *happy* to be told they are wrong.  Anyone who leads the group with a stick risks alienating members, too afraid to tell the big boss he or she is wrong. 
You got into this game early, which shows you have a lot of imagination.  If you want to stay in, now is the time to level up and think about where all this is going in the next few years.  If in doubt, remember the cognitive dissonance borne of hubris that the chiefs of blockbuster displayed when they refused to acknowledge the internet was about to render their empire obsolete. 
We can only figure out what that future looks like if we take the time to step back, read the lightning / rootstock / sidechain papers, watch the demos, listen to those that have a *deep* understanding of the technology and accept that no-one is in control of this spaceship.  
With those insights, you may have a number of lightbulb moments that will see you pivot your business in preparation for this new future in ways hitherto unforeseen. 
With respect to your enterprise, something like [Augur]( running over LN is a good example of where sportsbooks are most likely going to go.  In that future there will be no need for old web 2.0 layer 1 intermediaries, or indeed, many of the tokenised ICO vaporware projects that rushed into all of this too quickly.


Indeed it will :) and I wish you the best of luck in your endeavours!

Could be for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, the video is an hour long (most people haven't got that kind of attention span).  
Secondly, there are so many quality speakers now who are at the bleeding edge of all this (such as Andreas Antonopoulos) it's no longer a niche subject for armchair commentators recycling second and third hand information. 


I would highly recommend editing them down to more digestible chunks (5-10 minutes max) and providing an extended version for those interested.  
Otherwise, even quality material is just going to get lost in the noise, especially with all the traditional finance news commentary bitcoin is now attracting (which come in smaller, more easily digestible doses).

It gets tricky this freedom thing.  You end up procrastinating for awhile - enjoying the sunsets, stars, contemplating existence and wondering about what it all means.  Then you get to join the dots, make sense of things, and get on with the business of living instead of just surviving.
If you're lucky and have access to the internet, you'll get to throw yourself into learning about as many things that interest you, simply for the joy of learning.  
If you're really lucky you'll get to a point where the only belongings you need worry about will fit in a backpack and you will go wander the globe and see how connected and similar we all are once you put our petty tribal differences aside.  Travelling and going out of your comfort zone like this makes you wonder why it was you were so worried about 'letting go' of all those material trappings you thought made you happy.
You'll find yourself smiling more and you'll begin to notice that newfound happiness you exude is contagious.  You'll stop talking about money and events with people, appreciate the little things, and start indulging in what it is other people dream about, and how you might subtly help make their dreams come true.
And if you're really, really lucky, you'll find a way of turning your passion into 'work' and put all that wisdom and experience you've accrued into making the world a better place for the friends you will pick up along the way.  With that, you will let go of the need to control your life and the lives of those around you and simply enjoy the beautiful dance.
And at the end of the dance, you will find yourself procrastinating for awhile - enjoying the sunsets, stars, contemplating existence and wondering about what it all means ;)
And then you will join the dots... Until it's time to join the next dance... And on it goes... ;)

There's plenty of space for everyone to co-exist peacefully and no rush for any of this to happen.  Unless you're in somewhere like Venezuela where bitcoin is literally providing a lifeline to many people at the moment.  Then look to things like [the pineapple fund]( and all the bitcoin already flowing into massive charities around the globe as we speak.
In that respect, bitcoin has already proven its utility and gained widespread love and support around the world.
No amount of advertising campaigns, slick websites or 'move fast and break things' blockchain startups can say they have (or necessarily ever will) achieve that kind of awareness and real-world utility. 
It's likely alts with truly interesting properties will co-exist via atomic swaps, but those that are simply whitelabelled clones of the main code will fail to keep up with the rapid rate of peer-reviewed development that we see going on both at the protocol level and through things like [elements alpha](

Be wary of swanning around telling people this or that won't happen in the future.

Not sure if you read the parts about stepping outside the status quo and envisioning a completely different world and socio-economic system that all this is set to exist in?  
There are sooooo many ways all this could evolve both on the software and hardware level, the mind boggles...  Only thing we know for certain, the space will look nothing like it does today even a year from now.
So here's some thoughts off the top of my head.
1. Perhaps we'll only ever need 7 mining 'stations', one on each continent, with economic nodes housed in embassies.
2. Perhaps we won't need mining at all, or maybe we'll create a global distributed compute grid, and laptops and hardware will become a thing of the past, with nearly all tasks happening in augmented reality and VR. 
3. Maybe we'll use a different proof of work algorithm based on hard drive space or free bandwidth capacity.
4. We may see huge drives to create solar and hydro powered mining farms.  The early adopters of this tech are millennial and Gen-Z and they are highly conscious of the environment.  It may be that green energy based cloud mining becomes *the* driving force behind greening the entire energy sector.  If Google can run it's entire server infrastructure on Green energy, this tells us it's more than viable.
Of course, that's just focusing on bitcoin.  We are ignoring the fact that Green energy is now cheaper than fossil fuel energy and that initiatives like Elon Musk's solar roof tiles and breakthroughs such as windows that can now generate energy through solar, and even solar panelled highways will increasingly decentralise energy production and allow ordinary people and townships to go off-grid in increasing numbers.


Blockchain is one of about 4 technologies that bitcoin is built on.  We should try to avoid getting *trustless* systems confused with human networks of trust.  In that respect, payments was the *easiest* problem to solve at a network level once the double spend problem had been cracked.  It did not, however, solve the human trust problem.
Web of trust style networks, identity services, voting, land and property ownership... these are the really really exciting things bitcoin and blockchain are truly there to solve.  From the conferences I've attended and devs I've met, I'd say Blockstack looks like it's going to do just that.  
When it does, we'll wonder how on Earth we managed to sign into things (from our email accounts to the doctors surgery and voting booths) without it, and these dark times of having to remember a million passwords and trust our data with centralised services (happy to sell it on to third parties for a profit) will be behind us.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:05:12
Oh we need to be wayyyyy bigger than Visa to take this to where it really needs to go, none of which can happen on the main chain...  
All those reddit upvotes, facebook likes, ad impressions, retweets, youtube thumbs up, medium claps... and then... motorway toll booth charges, PoS swipes, one click shopping cart purchases, electoral votes... all of that has to start being translated into economic energy on sidechains married with blockstack and rootstock...
Thinking the primary aim of this technology is to 'compete' with the likes of Visa / WU (or any other financial incumbent for that matter) is like building a space rocket with the intention of strapping it to the roof of a lorry.  
When we get the machine payable web working for the likes of Google, AirBnb, YouTube, eBay, Alibaba, Lyft, G+... that's when things start getting really interesting... because it will completely change the way we think of the internet.  It's not just meatspace this then disrupts... 
Many of us can already see how this then crosses into gaming and VR, with massive in-game economies every bit as real as those in meatspace... Altcoins start to look very interesting when Eve Online currencies, WoW Gold and Second Life's Linden Dollars become real mediums of exchange in meatspace (as altcoins running via Atomic Swaps)... And why not?  After all, the very first bitcoin ATM was in Second Life where Linden Dollars were used to buy BTC.  When that starts rolling out, I think we all need to embrace the idea of a VR "third life". 
Competing with financial incumbents then begins to look positively pedestrian compared to the untapped economic energy this is going to unleash through hitherto unimagined applications of this tech.
As for Visa et al, they will of course have the opportunity to build their own sidechains and rebuild AML / KYC models through solutions like Blockstack...  Some of those incumbents will pivot with all this, some will no doubt call it a day.  
And if that last part sounds a bit far fetched, cast your mind back a few decades and think to how financial incumbents used the internet backbone to revolutionise their tech infrastructure and pivot their customer services.  
See how fun this gets when we no longer see it as "us vs. them", when we all start playing on the same team and actually begin thinking in truly imaginative ways of how to apply all this tech outside the financial world? ;)
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:12:36
I don't know if you were here at the beginning; if you were you would have seen a flurry of excited activity from techies actually building user facing things with all this (sounds of bitcoin, bitcoinity, blockchain.info, and myriad cool little things evolving out of ideas being shared though the community...).  All that creativity was lost as soon as VCs moved in and the guys and girls building those things had to divert energy to essay writing and FUD fighting... 
We don't need intellectuals discussing hardcore systems architecture over Twitter and dragging non techies into the 'debates' (that kinda' discussion can be entrusted to the 10,000+ scientists who have been in and out of the bitcoin GitHub for the last 9 years and openly discuss this via Linux Foundation mailing lists and IRC).
What we need are artists and creatives able to build truly unique and exciting frontend propositions that are decoupled from the profit incentive.  There are plenty of APIs out there now for tinkerers to make that happen without concerning themselves with protocol development.
That is what I mean when I say let the ecoystem figure the next bits out.  It's time to start playing with all this and getting ordinary users and developers excited about the possibilities.

Ensuring exchanges are operating with integrity is a good thing for bitcoin.  It means ordinary people are less likely to fall victim to fraudsters, and security audits ensure precautions like proper cold storage procedures are in place.  
This in turn reduces the likelihood of a price crash due to exchanges getting hacked, and generates more trust in bitcoin services (and bitcoin as a whole) with the general public.

Andreas is not central to these observations.  
It's more to do with how long I've been thinking about Pay What You Can Afford models routed through the numbeo API, after hearing Netflix launched in Cuba to great fanfare (for something like $7.99 a month) where the average Cuban wage is $20.
So more a commentary on the original volatility joke (and how that would be amplified when travelling if pegged to the relative values we place on stuff like food and entertainment; and just how out of reach things Westerners take for granted (like egalitarian access to music and the arts) is for many people on the globe).

Whereas in reality, the average Westerner now lives in more abundant luxury and comfort than Kings and Queens of old.  The world (despite the mainstream media knee-jerk rhetoric) has never been as safe as it is today.  We have less absolute poverty, less disease and less global war than at any other point in history.
Whilst that old system of shell companies and wealth hoarding is very much broken, Bitcoin is not the golden chalice that will simply fix it all.  First we need to stop equating money with wealth. You cite millennials are worse off, but if you were to take all those luxuries into consideration, are you?  
Wasn't that long ago when in the West, the best job prospects for many youngsters coming out of school were working down coal mines or in filthy factories...  Today, your vocational options are so wide, you can practically go fly anywhere in the world and find fulfilling employment.  Or just sit at home putting your creativity to work via youtube, patreon, instagram, blogging sites...
Bitcoin may serve as a release valve to allow all that boomer wealth currently stored up in property and speculation to flow back to a younger generation, but it will serve as a wealth *exchange*.  Not a takeover.  And it's not even certain in this new future whether property ownership will be that big of a deal.  Many millennials are opting to become 'digital nomads' and travel the world, free of the responsibilities that come with home ownership, bills and the like...  Their mantra "spend money on experiences, not things" is one that gels with many, and with flights now as cheap as a bus ride, and AirBnB a phone swipe away, there is no longer a need to stay in one fixed place.
There can be no 'revenge'; millennials of the "V for Vendetta" persuasion who missed the point of Alan Moore's original work (he hated the movie adaptation)... would do well to think about extending an olive branch to those boomers working in the light who have toiled so very hard to keep that old, broken system ticking over.
Bitcoin is not zero-sum.  It needs everyone onboard to reach its full potential.

A better analogy would be that sidechains and LN are like fitting that infant with a jet pack, which would of course make her (by orders of magnitude) faster than any athlete on the ground.
But yup, these are the big aspirations I and many other academics and scientists have for bitcoin...  Not dissimilar to the crazy ideas we had for where the internet might evolve back in the olden days, when I'd talk of being able to stream music and DVD quality video over IP, at a time when you could barely download a jpeg in under a minute and my friends (some of them computer scientists) were all telling us "but... nothing will replace CDs!".
*"An invention has to make sense in the world in which it is finished, not the world in which it is started." — Ray Kurzweil*
Again I ask people to think about the adjacent possible as opposed to getting caught in the here and now... And then dare to come invent a more perfect future instead of complaining about imperfections of the present.  
After all, it was only with that kind of believing in a new tomorrow that bitcoin got from being an outlandish idea on an esoteric mailing list to where it is today - with over half a million subscribers on reddit and an entire world in awe at the potential of it all.

Well then may I humbly suggest you read some [Nick Szabo essays]( attend some conferences, and join the dev mailing lists if you're keen to learn about all this.
Here's the dev mailing list:
With more digestible formatting for lurkers here:
If you are not a computer scientist and/or aren't able to grok these high-level discussions, may I humbly suggest you find a more proactive role within this ecosystem where you can positively help us with the many things that need doing to raise awareness (public outreach, teaching your parents how to secure their keys, submission of cool ideas, newbie on-boarding, raising awareness with your favourite charity, producing movies/music/art, talking to local merchants in your community about bitcoin, starting/attending local meetup groups, forum moderation etc. etc.)
We can't all be programmers or system analysts, but we each have brilliant skills we can offer to the community when we step outside the oh so boring echo chamber of armchair critique of things we don't understand, and actually get excited about the things we *can do* to help support this movement :)
All of that requires actual effort and commitment, but the reward from knowing you played a part to help is more than worth it, and is nothing compared to the efforts that were required by a tiny minority in the very very early days.

The more oxygen and airtime we give bcash, the more bitcoin detractors enjoy the division that has been created in the community.
There are many good people on both 'sides' vested in bitcoin - the idea.  If you really want to see us all thrive, we'd do well to divert our attentions to the good things happening in Bitcoin and build bridges, rather than perpetuating divisions across people who, ultimately, have the same longterm hopes and aspirations for Bitcoin - the technology.
In the end, it's the ordinary users of the technology that get to decide where all this goes.  Showing them we are a good bunch of people with their best interests at heart (as opposed to school kids calling each other names and fighting over a toy) is the best route to longterm adoption.

First, let me tell you I'm from a working class background; have done all kinds of low-paid jobs (from factory work to van driving) and was, in fact, one of those Gen-X bunch that couldn't find a job after graduating in computer science, thanks to the dotcom crash.
I ended up doing it all on my own and starting a web development company from scratch.  That first year as a solo startup nearly killed me; it meant working solidly (and I mean 16 hours a day 7 days a week) for probably around half the minimum wage to pull it off, but I managed it in the end.  
As a result of that slog, I have had the privilege and joy of being one of those first 'digital nomads' to be able to travel the globe with nothing but a laptop and my ideas...
The truth is, you really can do anything in this world if you believe in it (and yourself) enough.  But you have to get off your arse and find a way out and understand that the best things in life take time and hard work...  Complaining or blaming others for your situation gets you nowhere fast.  Why?  Because it's a downer, and you will attract the same type of glass half empty people, instead of those who believe anything is possible if you put your mind to it.
Like everyone I have ups and downs too and some days are darker than others, but mostly I believe we live in a friendly world full of opportunity and good people.  The best way of finding those good people is through helping others without expecting anything in return.
I've been in bitcoin for a very, very long time.  When I realised what this technology could do, I dropped everything to support this movement.  It's never been about money, or lambos or get-rich quick for me, it's been about fixing all the world's problems (many of which you cite above).
Your anger and vitriol is not something I don't understand or feel viscerally and, indeed, was the reason many of us got behind bitcoin in those early days, because someone needed to make a stand...  As such, in those early days I sat at conferences and meetups with many of the people you are all now just discovering... back when we were all being laughed at... Back when everyone thought we were just a crazy bunch of nerds who didn't understand the 'real' world.  
But that was a long time ago.  
What many don't yet see, is that Bitcoin is a salve for that old world, not a battering ram.  It - and many of the people who helped bootstrap this community - have moved on from having to fight to get this technology out there and there are no longer any 'sides' for people to take...  You're either with the idea that bitcoin was built for the whole of humanity to exit, or you're standing alone in the arena shouting into the darkness.
You can keep shouting if you must, or you can take these beautiful gifts we have built for the world (bitcoin, patreon, youtube, indiegogo) and use them to create things capable of making the world (and *your* world) a better place.  That, of course, requires the courage to stand up and become a leader in whatever it is you are most passionate about.
Whilst we may all be walking different paths in this strange bitcoin universe, we all seek the same thing...  A free humanity.

His/her point is that the new Layer 2/3 technology is really happening (see [atomic swaps]( and when it goes live, we will look back on these days and laugh at how everyone fought over different alt coins, since they will all be running on top of bitcoin - the protocol.
It's likely a few alts with interesting properties and good teams with integrity behind them will have a future, but the vast majority will be seen as competing protocol concepts that failed to gain traction (much like the various competing protocols to IP that came out after the internet was announced were eventually shelved in favour of the most open protocol).
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:49:59
So the community noticed a problem - people weren't comfortable learning how to secure their coins - and came up with two solutions.  In this case, paper wallets and hardware wallets.
Some enterprising and hardworking individuals then released bitaddress.org and created entire new businesses (Trezor and Ledger) off the back of those problems.
None of this would be fun if there weren't challenges to surmount.  Any more than a game of Sim City would be fun if the city was already pre-built for you and working perfectly.  
You are all really early adopters of a network and technology that is still trying to understand what it is and what it might one day become.  There are many opportunities ahead for creative spirits excited by these challenges, and many teething problems that must be endured.  If you are expecting everything to be there for you served on a shiny plate in a walled garden, you should settle for Apple Pay or stick to the the Visa network.  The West doesn't really have it all that bad when it comes to cheap payments.  Indeed, you can even get a bitcoin debit card that uses the Visa network that you can link to android pay if you want to.  
Personally, I'm much more interested in what Layer 2/3 will do for machine-payable web, micropayments and the internet as a whole.  When that stuff is viable, then cheap retail payments will be the next obstacle.  In the meantime, bitcoin serves as Gold 2.0, something we've never had before as a species.  
So my advice is this.  Have patience, enjoy the journey and remember how long it took the internet to get from Email to HD Streaming.  
Have fun, and try not to get too worked up by people who complain about the tough challenges we face... and don't forget all the incredible problems that have already been surmounted.  Nothing is impossible.

You set yourself up by saying things with such certainty, ending up in the same company as people like the head of IBM who in the 70's said "There will never be a need for more than 5 computers."

Yup there's a great deal of over privileged ignorant talking heads on TV and in newspapers standing in the spotlight who like to throw mud and talk nonsense.  But that world of false idols and false 'experts' have all but had their day.
My advice is to ignore it.  Literally.  Stop reading newspapers and watching news shows.  They thrive off causing tribalism and anger.  So take away their oxygen by rising above it all and just get on with making peoples day better...  Could be as simple as taking your used coffee cup back to the counter and saying thanks to the waiter serving you.  Before you know it, that tiny act of kindness might lead to you making a new facebook friend who turns out to be a designer you might one day hire...
The boomers did all this before by the way, with business cards and filofaxes.  We have the privilege of being able to do it at light speed with the swipe of a smartphone ;)
Ultimately, those old airwaves and that news print no-one reads anymore will have less and less impact...  Which is why, in London and other places in the UK they're actually having to give those newspapers away for free.
No-one reads them anymore except for those stuck in the echo chamber.  
That old world can't stop what's going on in this globally connected digital realm of relentlessly optimistic collaboration (powered by youtube, reddit, G+, and secret facebook groups).
So have faith in yourselves, take the insults on the chin and rise above them (just like bitcoiners had to rise above the billions of insults at the beginning).  And appreciate that in the middle of all this are an entirely different group (Generation X) that actually built the many tools of the internet (and bitcoin) that you today take for granted.
Then say a big hello to Gen-Z 'cause they're a group who grew up with a fully formed Wikipedia and, as such, are capable of filtering out all the noise better than *any* of us.
Then, when you're ready, go teach the old people how all this works...  Because that's the crux of the problem here: ignorance from all sides.

Well I've been reading about AI for 30 years.  I actually have to take with a pinch of salt most of Elon's comments on the subject.  He's not a computer scientist; he's a marvellous visionary CEO and a great 'generalist', but he's not an actual scientist specialising in any of this.  Those that are grew up reading [Asimov]( and others who had been writing and talking about AI for some 50 years or more...  Heck, Elon only just read Nick Bostrom's [Simulation Argument]( (a paper I read back in 2004).  Now Elon and a bunch of people in the public eye are jumping on the simulation argument and are an authority on all this when I and people like me have been thinking about it practically every single day for the last 13 years?  Come on.
So yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about what Elon says or what newspapers say, they like to get everyone worked up in a state of panic - that's what sells.  Elon has legitimate concerns, none of which weren't already considered by the actual scientists working on all this.
If you're really keen to form a well rounded opinion on all this though, go study A.I. properly, read some science journals and some Asimov, and you will have the knowledge to be able to think for yourself on these matters.  Just like bitcoin, A.I. is a massively complex subject, reading a FUD article in a newspaper on bitcoin or AI, does not an expert maketh. 
As an aside: Have you ever seen 12 Monkeys?  You could raise exactly the same concerns about the fact we have the ability to engineer a biological virus capable of wiping everyone out...  Or nuclear missiles...  Or computers (and the internet) now running the entire planet.
I don't see anything going drastically wrong with A.I. - because techies building it are not gonna' be stupid enough to let that happen any more than those handling dangerous viruses in labs around the world are going to be stupid enough to make mistakes there either.  That's why we have peer-review and why things like this are subjected to such wide scrutiny. 
That's not to say there aren't going to be lots of cock-ups and "holy crap!" moments along the way.  But, like in bitcoin core, everything will be subjected to that constant peer review and it will all happen in very slow stages.
Here's the first thing they taught us in A.I classes at uni some 20 years ago btw...  [The Milgram Experiment](  All of the discussions and debates people like Elon are bringing to the attention of normal everyday people today, we were all having in class back then.

At no point, in my comment, was I talking about *you*.


At no point did I say I support centralisation (in fact I said quite the opposite).
Ultimately, it matters not what you or I think, it's down to what solutions we collectively *build* to solve *real* world problems that users themselves choose to get behind.
And out of all the competing blockchains, so far only bitcoin and ethereum have made any real impact in addressing those real world issues (such as the UN world food programme that uses both BTC and ETH to deliver aid in a decentralised fashion).
Drop the hate and anger, we're all on the same side here.

Decentralised, focus on security and peer-reviewed cautious updates; has the world's leading experts in all this fully behind it since the beginning; full transparency and commitment to consensus based development; working groups from MiT to UCL and Stanford, some of which have been together for 9 years.  
In the end it's all about people, their belief in the idea, and their ability to work together toward a beautiful shared dream and the collective understanding that the project itself is bigger than the needs of any individual members or groups.
And you are right in highlighting other blockchains with utility... All of which can work in tandem with bitcoin and the atomic swaps network (ethereum can run via rootstock for example).  That's the beauty of sidechains.
What we're really asking is what underlying protocol will be used to ratify everything in the future?  Did we need more than one internet protocol?
Time will tell.
It's up to what *users* of the technology choose to adopt in the end.  Will you secure your house and assets on a blockchain run by a small coterie of businessmen behind closed doors or opt for the one that has 10,000+ of the world's smartest scientists operating in a completely open who have already proved for 9 years straight that they're up to the task of securing those assets?

Well we all know money is created out of thin air and just produced on a whim.  There's no real mathematical cap to a magic money printing machine.  Especially when that money can be counterfeited so easily.  Which is why many economists tell us the debts owed by countries can never be repaid back.  
Since a debt is 'an amount of money owed, to be repaid at a later date' by saying it can never be paid back they are actually admitting it doesn't exist.  
Understanding this was what lead Henry T. Ford to say "it's just as well the average person doesn't understand the banking industry; if they did there'd be a revolution before breakfast".
Bitcoin is different of course.  It's not a debt based currency, it cannot be counterfeited and, unlike fiat, there is an *actual* mathematical cap to the amount that can ever be produced.
That makes it exceedingly valuable for anyone interested in using it to shield their wealth as we transition away from those old systems.

If you had been around that tiny group of early believers you would perhaps realise it meant dropping everything to support this movement.  
Many ended up devoting nearly every waking hour and all their intellectual energy, wearing multiple hats (without financial reward) to keep this ship afloat.  Pamela Morgan (Andreas' partner at third key) is another early devotee that risked everything.  
Same goes for the guys and girls keeping the code together.
It's really hard to explain all this to people whose world revolves around money - i.e. how one can be so in love with an idea, that as long as basic living needs are covered, everything else is secondary to that idea succeeding.  
We can perhaps sum it up in the image of Aaron Swartz who, after selling Reddit for more money than most can possibly imagine, continued to live in a tiny box room apartment, bought no new clothes, no cars or other material trappings and, instead, devoted his life to activism and freedom of information.

If it does, I think it will take a lot *less* than a decade if it follows the same trajectory the internet did.  
It was a much harder climb from 0 - 1k than it was 1k - 10k.  Same should hold true for 10k - 100k then 100k - 1m, as the numbers become more and more relative to inter-subjective ideas of 'value' (think how quickly we get used to 1000 Indian rupees being equal to £10).  After awhile the added zeros mean very little.
By then the masses using bitcoin will be thinking in terms of satoshis and millibits.
In the run-up, as we see more and more announcements from institutional investors coming onboard coupled with the near exponential user growth, those crazy valuations we're hearing almost become a self fulfilling prophecy.  
We may all look back in hindsight and say, "well duh, it was the internet of money, of course it was going to become the most important store of value on the planet."
We're really only at the tip of the iceberg with all this.   Just as we look back at the internet pre-YouTube era, I feel we won't even recognise a post-bitcoin internet a decade from now.    
Of course I can't see into the future any more than you can, there will be many more obstacles ahead this community will have to help navigate, but I feel the hardest part is over.

Regulating an on-ramp for ordinary people is not comparable to regulating cryptocurrency.
I think we can all agree that exchanges like Coinbase have a duty of care to people finding bitcoin for the first time and ensuring their funds are secure and safe.

Yeah, Lloyd has shown a lot of humility and I feel his common sense, cautious approach to all this is how all finance 'experts' should be looking at bitcoin.  Sure beats the talking head hubris we are so often exposed to.

I don't find it painful compared to what we've been through to date.  If you live in the West, hold Bitcoin and be glad you now have a way of saving that is not pegged to the old system.  
Be grateful too that you can get Bitcoin visa cards and signup to things like bitwage that will allow you to exit.  This isn't a fight between visa et al and Bitcoin any longer; they may all adapt their old systems to cater for Bitcoin when it eventually becomes just another currency like the euro or the pound.
But as with lightning, it will take time to upgrade those systems and for the old world to figure out how to adopt bitcoin safely.
I mean, step back a moment...  What is so wrong with your life in the West that you actually *need* lightning in day to day life right now?  For us programmers, the real excitement is what this tech will enable us to do with the internet in terms of the machine payable web, internet of things, micropayments on websites rewarding and incentivising good contributors and creators.  We literally won't recognise the web when all this evolves...
If you do absolutely *need* cheap and fast crypto payments (perhaps in a business startup in this space experimenting) then use Litecoin or one of the other alts that are currently better suited.
This will lesson the load on bitcoin and the mempool and actually help bitcoin during this interim scaling phase.
The solutions that come, including atomic swaps will eventually be adopted by all those other alts anyway.
And remember if the price was mooning the posts would be about that (again missing the point of the tech revolution going on).  When there's a relative lull, the same impatient minds start weighing in on issues like scaling which they don't have any real understanding about.
We can be excited by the future, but we can also let go of dreaming away the present lest we forget to enjoy the moment and all the amazing things happening right now.

Money, btw, is usually a terrible incentive for these kinds of things (look at the billions mySpace had vs. the one man coding army that was Markey Z at the beginning).

First questions we should be asking everyone (be they people in r/btc r/bitcoin or economists and 'experts' on MSM) is "Do you understand the technology?" "Have you read the whitepapers?"  "Do you have any computer science credentials?" and so forth...  Just like, if your car needs a tune up, you are going to ask a car mechanic for advice, not a car parking attendant, right?
Now, on scaling, bear in mind that *even* the vast majority of computer scientists (I am one) will be the first to admit they don't fully understand the exact mechanics of say, the Lightning Network.
However, that's not to say we don't have a good understanding of how *best* to scale technology in general (after all many of us have built websites that had to cater to millions of users on much lower end server tech than is available today, so we do know a great deal about the best approach toward robust scaling solutions in more generalist terms).
Andreas Antonopolous - as I am sure you are aware - is an incredible computer scientist and bitcoin educator, and he is the first to admit he too doesn't fully understand the mechanics of the Lightning Network and other Layer 2/3 tech; even after reading the whitepapers some 3 times.  Most of the people proferring an opinion on all this haven't even read those whitepapers, let alone digested and grokked them fully.
Rewind some 9 years: It took many of the early believers in all this months and months of reading like maniacs to understand bitcoin the first time round...  Understanding where Layer 2/3 takes us is, for many, like going back to the drawing board...  It means going back to school for many of us, which takes time, effort and patience.  
As with *everything* in life, we have to take what we read and hear from 'experts' who think they know the future of all this with a big pinch of salt.  Truth is, there's only a handful of people in the world who truly understand the technology right now, and just what is going to be possible...  The honest ones involved in all this will be humble enough to tell you *they don't truly understand the tech or what's going to be possible* because it's *not possible* to understand it all - there are too many variables and it's all moving at a breathtaking speed.
The one thing we can say for sure though: Ultimately, as with the internet, it will be infrastructure developers creating beautiful things that users actually want to use, that will decide how all this unfolds.
We must be patient, as everyone else plays catchup and, in doing so, learn to be confident thinking for ourselves and being ok to say "I don't know enough about xyz to offer an opinion either way".  The good news is, everything so far is ahead of schedule on the Layer 2/3 front and you don't have to be a techie to offer something amazing to this community.

Great points!  The only thing that makes sense is letting go of the need to control.  There are way too many variables at play for any one group to be able to truly shape this technology.
Whilst it may seem counter intuitive, the faster we let go, the faster the ecoystem will find the best way forward. 
Finding our place within that ecoystem is key - instead of wasting energy trying to influence events outside our sphere of influence, we ought to choose to engage instead in areas that *are*.  That's often as simple as finding a niche within all this that fits in with things we are passionate about.
Rewind 20 years... It's not unlike discovering this internet thing and building a website about x,y,z covering a subject we are excited about.  At the moment, people who could be building those websites are instead getting involved in pointless debates, trying to tell the architects of that internet that made it all possible how to integrate the next series of protocol enhancements.

Which is fine right?  Way I see it, coinbase are kinda' like the Apple App store - a nice safe walled garden for non tech-savvy people to get onboard, and that is something we absolutely need right now.
As beautiful as bitcoin is, much of the infrastructure around it needs massive amounts of UX work that will make it more accessible to the ordinary user.   
The alt space creates a nice little playground for people to experiment and spread the load off the main bitcoin chain.  If the only option for the 100k+ people coinbase were adding each day was just bitcoin, I'm not sure even a segwit upgrade could deal with the load. 
How does all this play out when Layer 2/3 is ready and companies and projects start launching coins and tokens for *real* things via rootstock and atomic swaps?
Well, all those youngsters and grans who have been playing around in the (mostly junk) alt coin sandbox, are now pretty well versed in trading and buying 'stocks'.  In future iterations of this tech, we'll then see them investing in everything from, say, TESLA shares to backing *real* ICO's that will have a positive impact on the world.
Whatever the motives are behind coinbase's actions then, the end result is a win for everyone (however it all plays out).

Atomic swaps allow all those alts to work anywhere bitcoin is accepted seamlessly via Layer 2 tech.  The Lightning network and wallets like Eclair and Zap means micro payments, the machine payable web and western coffee purchases can happen instantaneously and with close to zero fees, with bitcoin being used as the base settlement layer.
Rootstock (smart contract platform) brings all of the functionality of the solidity lanaguage and ethereum, to bitcoin, and a new programming language called simplicity is currently in development.
Sidechain elements alpha has been running for some 2 years with myriad projects (such as Lightning) having been developed there, many of which are yet to announce.  
We're at the 1996 stage of the internet where everyone has just started using email, Layer 2/3 tech represents the invention of the world's first web browser.
Incredibly, all of the above is happening *ahead* of schedule, which is almost unheard of in software projects.
Where this goes no-one knows (it is for users to ultimately decide) but it's going to be fun watching it all unfold!
And the beauty of bitcoin is, since it touches (and changes) everything when we come to think of value transfer, you don't have to be a coder or techy to get involved :)
In the meantime, bitcoin continues to be used in places like Argentina and Venezuela this very moment to shield tens of thousands of people from currency pressure, and via UN initiatives like the World Food Programme.  Over in the West it is creating a form of social mobility for a new generation of tech savvy youngsters that would have otherwise been caught in the trap of perpetual debt (many people, for instance, have been able to pay off student loans early thanks to bitcoin).

This.  Imagine what happens when the third world can hook into something like the Blockstream satellite, bootstrap their own ICO / Crowdfunder / Alt Currencies that run over atomic swaps...  Then imagine all those ad-hoc maker economies (everything from music to traditional handicrafts) hooking into this mega global P2P 'tradenet' that would result...  
This gets even more interesting when they can launch as sellers via revamped (bitcoin enabled) eBay and Alibaba platforms...  Suddenly a traditional, hand-made wedding dress no longer has a 9500% retail markup to western consumers.  Similarly, music/video/art can flow to western audiences without distributors giving 'permission' or taking a cut.
When Layer 3 rolls out Blockstack / Rootstock can provide a means for exporting those seller / producer trust ranks gained from places like eBay and Alibaba into immutable trust records that can be tied to smart contracts without any intermediaries or fallible 'big data' custodians.
This big old world then begins to look at lot smaller, and a lot more friendly ;)

It's this kind of hubris and 'too big to fail' attitude that got the banks in trouble.  
Bitcoiners have a lot more in common with Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and the alt coin crowd than many would like to admit.  After all, it was we bitcoiners that FUNDED ethereum (via the first ICO).  They are our slightly better organised (through centralisation of leadership) cousin.  And the people trailblazing there are teaching both bitcoiners and finance incumbents a heck of a lot about what is going to be possible with this tech (and vice versa).
Whilst I prefer the decentralised ragtag bunch of beautiful crazy misfits that comprise bitcoin, and think that's the only thing that can work longterm once we smooth out faster ways of reaching consensus, there's still a lot to be said for the 9-5ers over in Ethereum who are bringing some much needed organisation to the space thanks to the more centralised leadership approach.  
Both approaches have their pros and cons.  As such, there's a lot of good ideas coming from all camps.  And a whole bunch of bad actors in those camps that often spoil it for the rest by getting all worked up over the technology and forgetting that **this is not a race**.
We'd all be better off collaborating and losing the religious zeal: we are *all* far stronger working together, reminding ourselves that we are all seeds from the same pod... and allowing the ecosystem to find the best solutions, without needing to take ownership of ideas that belong to no-one.
This is a far more efficient use of time than throwing toys out of the pram whilst deriding one another with "my blockchain is better than your blockchain."
I'm with Bitcoin because I believe in the people first and foremost.  But I'll fight for the right of others to go fork the code and try a new approach with different governance models.  That's freedom of speech, and code is speech.
It is absolutely possible to co-exist once you get out of the zero-sum mindset.

I see sidechains evolving that will enable WhatsApp style money movement that will be instant and free, yes.  All you'd need is a trusted blockstack ID.  I see this being integrated in everything from Microsoft passport to Facebook, Gmail, Android Pay and even WhatsApp itself.  
I also see energy around the globe becoming free.  There is no reason it couldn't be once we begin removing the invisible borders that separate us and the profit incentive that sees everything as zero sum.  
It's clear we yearn for a new human narrative and increasingly we are looking to the stars and imagining what a Type I Civilisation might look like...  Some of us will need to lead the way, and endure the wisecracks and hubris of naysayers and luddites unable to see that far ahead...  Just as the original motley crew of bitcoiners had to endure the ignorance of those who failed to think outside the confines of the status quo.  And, indeed those maverick futurists who came before, such as The Wright Brothers who dared to believe that heavier than air objects could fly (whilst the rest of the world shook their heads and laughed)...
Time will tell, I can't see into the future any more than you but I see we humans are capable of achieving the impossible when we put our minds to it and work towards a common goal...
In the meantime, there is no need to know how all this unfolds... Why spoil the journey and feel the need to jump straight to the final movie scene when there's so much dancing to do along the way?

I'd say this is very little to do with development budget, and more to do with time constraints and management of priorities.  Bear in mind they're juggling a lot more than just development.  
Further, very few techies have the actual expertise to pull this off and when so much is at stake - as with core development - slower and more cautious beats running at it full tilt.  
Take a look at all the other wallets and exchanges that also have "WiP" or "Planned" and you will see Breadwallet, and Mycelium (who are well loved by the community) also haven't rolled out Segwit yet.  Even though they (presumably) have far fewer pressing concerns than coinbase who are perhaps growing a little too fast for their own comfort.


I'm sorry but this is absolute poppycock.  
BTC has already reached the tipping point toward mass adoption.  It did so the moment it was being embedded in movies, cartoons, artwork, tv shows, sprayed on walls and used as the only real escape possible from broken monetary policies in places like Venezuela and Argentina.  Westerners moaning about transaction fees who fail to see that the price increase alone has paid for every single transaction fee they've likely paid (simply by holding onto it) have entirely missed the point of why bitcoin was created in the first place.  
It wasn't to fuel cheap retail transactions in Starbucks (get a bitcoin debit card for that) it was to provide an Exit - through science - for a world economy that has had old world 'leaders' and 'experts' desperately looking for a solution to the madness.
Yes those cheap retail payments will become a reality in the not too distant future, with sidechains scaling to billions of transactions per second, and it will bring something much more exciting than cheap coffee purchases with it: the machine-payable web, micropayments and massive immutable web of trust networks which will completely change the way we look at the internet and the world.  
And yes those solutions will take time, just as it took 10 years of the internet before streaming video was feasible... but no, no other alt will be 'king' (as you put it) since the sidechains being developed are designed in such a way that those alts will co-exist (via atomic swaps) if they represent a niche value proposition to the groups they will be built to cater for.  None of this is going to be zero-sum. 
Further, if people think that other alts wouldn't suffer the same problems with scaling outside those layer 2/3 solutions then they truly don't understand the technology or the hurdles (and incredible solutions) that lie ahead.  That's OK, most people don't understand the SWIFT network that powers their internet banking transfers either.  
Only difference here is, we don't have a bunch of non-techies debating the intricacies of the SWIFT network on reddit ad infinitum.  
So think of it this way: ordinary people in this space know a LOT about the basics of how bitcoin works and when they see a bunch of old economists (who haven't spent months researching all this) talking nonsense on MSM, they quite rightly facepalm and lambast those economists for getting it all wrong.
So how do you think the techies actually building all this who understand the technology inside out (and the solutions that are coming) look to those same people on here who seem to have lots of opinions on highly technical discussions, but haven't even as much as looked at, say, [Elements Alpha]( let alone read whitepapers or done any actual development through it.
Yet whilst all this armchair debate has been going on 1,000's of software engineers have been working on these things quietly behind the scenes for the last two years.
I think if people really want to help this community then the first thing everyone who seems to have an opinion on all this should be asking is: "am I a computer scientist?"  If yes, then "do I understand enough about this to proffer an opinion, or do I need to go spend 6 months learning about this new layer 2/3 technology before I start thinking about coding (or advising on coding)?"  
If the answer to the CS question is no, then perhaps we should be asking why people feel they should have a voice in what is, essentially, a computer science discussion?
It's kinda' like me going into an automobile forum telling all the mechanics in there how to fix the carburettor they're having problems with... It won't be long until they'd realise I am completely out of my depth and I wouldn't be too shocked if they then politely ask me to go do something more useful with my time.
Fortunately, because bitcoin touches absolutely everything, you don't need to be a computer scientist to find your niche within all this, any more than you needed to be a CS to bring something interesting to the internet back when that was being built ;)

First you need to understand that bitcoin is a work in progress.  It has evolved in myriad complex ways as we all tried to figure out exactly what it was, and where it needed to go next.
Many people shouting for 'bigger blocks now' fail to see the elephant in the room.  A blocksize increase does not allow us to scale to the billions of transactions this is going to need.
Sorry if you do not quite yet understand the long term proposition of all this, or why priority has to be on keeping the main chain and user funds secure (Gold 2.0) whilst we await those Layer 2/3 solutions to come online.
In the interim, Layer 1 intermediaries like Bitpay are adding support for some of those alts and also preparing their services for Layer 2/3.  Give them a try if you think that might help in the interim.  And be aware, that ultimately, all alts generally tend to flow back into bitcoin as *the* most trusted store of value.
You really do have a plethora of solutions out there to explore, but perhaps you ought ask yourself seriously if bitcoin is ready for your purposes.
Ultimately there's only one question we need to ask when trying to figure out which blockchain has the greatest merit:
When people are selling houses on the blockchain (which is happening already).  Which one would you most trust with the value of that property stored there?
P.S. I'm not *just* a programmer.  Like many of the early believers, i'm also technically a businessman / entrepreneur and systems analyst.  First internet startup was 15 years ago.  Programming teaches you patience.

You could say that of *any* area that like-minded people congregate.  
If you started a jazz cafe bar for Lous Armstrong fans in town, and a bunch of hells angels came in one day, started pissing on the floor and took over the soundsystem with heavy metal music... would you be in your right to explain to them it was a jazz cafe bar, and the people that started it had certain guiding principles, like not pissing on the floor?
Would you be in your right to turn the heavy metal music off and ask the new people coming in to respect the space that was made for jazz aficionados?  And if they refused, would it not be your right to ask them to leave?  
And vice versa, if the Jazz fans visited the heavy metal bar, would not the hells angels have the right to turn away anyone who loudly and proactively insisted on playing Louis Armstrong?
Fortunately, in meatspace, we automatically respect these kinds of boundaries and the basic rules and societal contracts that govern places.  We do not usually think it OK to walk into a church and start shouting "fuck you!" at the congregation, because we respect the right of the people to assemble there.  Nor do we go into our parents living room and start jumping up and down on the furniture without expecting to be rebuked.  Nor cry 'censorship!' when we are...
We are, of course, free to go elsewhere and create our own communities if we don't like any of that.  We can start a hells angels bar, we can go jump on *our* own furniture... 
The same basic common decency and respect applies to nearly every subreddit on this website.  We don't go in and expect a depressing story we post to go down well there, any more than we would invade (as laymen) a group of physicists and start telling them how the particle accelerator they've been working on for a decade is supposed to work ;)

I can only speak for my reality, but that seems to be the way of things from my own personal experiences over the many years I've lived on this planet.
And it's a common thread with the people I have met along the way who have done extraordinary things with their lives.  Very few had it easy.  It seems 'success' comes down to how we cope with failure, and how prepared we are to get back up again when things don't go as planned.  And just how determined we are to learn from those mistakes and keep moving forward...
A good example might be J.K. Rowling, who wrote Harry Potter whilst on welfare with 2 kids to look after as a single Mother.  She had to go to 13 publishers before she finally got a break.  Just think if she'd given up the 12th time!  The world (and hers) would look very different.
This shows life has very little to do with the things you came into this world with, or the rough hands you might have been dealt, or the things you think might hold you back... and everything to do with what you believe you are capable of achieving if you put your mind to it.  
A similar thread runs through the rags to riches stories of everyone from Charlie Chaplin to Arnold Schwarzenegger.  And of course, bitcoiners themselves who, at the very beginning of all this, had to believe the impossible dream even though the whole world was against them... Where we're at today was just that back then - a dream.  Today, it's as real as the flying machines the Wright Brothers dreamt up back when the whole world said they were idiots.  We call those flying machines aeroplanes of course; it's taken for granted it took two guys believing in the impossible just a little over 100 years ago to have such a profound impact on life for the rest of us.
Of course it's not easy, this realisation that your entire reality comes down solely to *you*, how you treat others, and what you choose do with your own mind.

Many of the most altruistic tech people I know from the beginning of all this, (i.e. those that truly see bitcoin as a way of creating a more fair and equitable world for us all), put their existing businesses (and a whole lot more) on the line for all this, and actually gave away 100s if not 1000s of bitcoins in the early days to friends and family.  
They're the real believers btw... Those obsessed with money and Lamborghinis are just a grotesque mirror of the greed that lead to bitcoin being needed in the first place.

Anyone in this space advising honest, hard working ordinary people to leave their coins on an exchange when they *know* these exchanges are vulnerable to exploitation, is a person who clearly does not have one shred of respect for the *people* using this, and certainly has no respect for the technology itself or the engineers building on it.
Many, many companies and individuals in this space have worked tirelessly these past few years to create services and products (such as hardware wallets) that will protect users from the vulnerabilities that come with leaving your bitcoin on centralised exchanges.
In the end, people who think they can play fast and loose with other people's money and view this is a silly little game, will come to find, we reap what we sow.

The more I reflect on how it all played out (and how slow to adapt Segwit tech teams have been since the B2X drama), the more I wonder if tech teams advising NYA companies just wanted the easy way out, instead of rewriting existing codebases.  
It's much simpler for coders to simply add a bigger MySQL instance when the DB is sluggish than it is to diligently optimise the code that lead to the bottlenecks.  
Perhaps, in the end then, it was simply sloth that lead to the impasse.

Why would you think that? Was ethereum DoA because of centralised governance? 
Rootstock merely adds another layer of functionality that allows for all kinds of interesting smart contract infrastructure services to blossom, without sacrificing the integrity (and decentralised nature) of the underlying protocol.  And bitcoin sorely needs this kind of Layer 2 push if it is to compete with the rapid pace of innovation coming out of more centralised blockchain protocols.  
Remember, whatever gets built on this, is opt-in, and does not impact your right (or the right of those in oppressed countries) to use bitcoin as a store of value.  
I would love to see, for instance, a truly trusted ICO platform with tokens secured by bitcoin (as opposed to ERC20) where we know each ICO offering has been properly vetted by a crowd of trusted bitcoin engineers who have performed full due diligence on the proposals coming in.  Safe in the knowledge that token issuance is similarly compliant thanks to bulletproof code reviews, and a number of airtight checks and balances that have been placed there by the Rootstock team (similar in some ways to the faith we give to professional teams keeping coins secure at centralised exchanges like Coinbase).  
Imagine then, an ICO working group that operates under peer review in the same way BIP's (bitcoin improvement proposals) attract the scrutiny of 1000's of techies... feeding into all this... and we start to see the amazing places all this will lead :)
If we crack that, the kinds of scams we see on ethereum via ICO's simply can't happen on bitcoin due to that peer review and due diligence.  
All of which further solidifies bitcoin's long term fundamentals as *the* blockchain of trust and security.

Nicely said.  Ultimately, I think what all 'sides' (in old world and new) are trying to avoid is the [tragedy of the commons]( setting in before the technology is fully matured. 
It's a subtle game (almost the reverse of a bank run) that needs a calm, measured and rational approach.  As such, we need to exercise immeasurable amounts of compassion and patience, as everyone gets to grips with the (soon to become self-evident) reality that science has figured out how to move economic energy around the globe as easily as we send a whatsapp message.  
And why not?  A .jpg email attachment essentially has a far greater data payload than a a simple debit/credit in a global ledger.  
Remove all the blockchain hype surrounding that old paperbelt world governed by "protectionists with good intentions", and this idea of "money as unfettered information" is the *real* elephant in the room.
As this new reality slowly dawns on us all, I am quite sure humanity will perform a collective facepalm and wonder what all the fuss was about. 
 
Whilst the ramifications of all this are as mind boggling (and intimidating to some) as the idea of connecting every computer on the globe via this crazy idea we called the internet, they are in equal parts thrilling and awe inspiring.  The greatest lesson of the internet is that we have nothing to fear from technology that is designed to bring people - and the world - closer together.  Bitcoin is no different in that respect.  Good people in numbers will always be one step ahead of those that mean to do harm.
All that is required for the last bits of this grand project to fall into place, is for those wayseers who are 5-10 years ahead, to stay humble, wait for the rest to catch up, and never stop believing that we live in a friendly universe.  Because, as anyone who has travelled extensively will tell you, we absolutely do ;)

Yes, it's all a state of mind.
The system is built in such a way that those determined enough can change the laws and beliefs that govern our current state of reality, and with it our models and collective understanding of how the world works.  
*“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” ― R. Buckminster Fuller.*
if you're not happy with your reality you have the opportunity to change it...  Civil rights, women's rights, the anti-war movement, the fall of the Berlin wall, gay marriage, anti SOPA movement...  All things that took one or two people who cared enough to change a reality they were unhappy with that gained enough momentum with the crowd to actually change the world.  Bitcoin is one such example of a determined group of people that decided to upend our understanding of the way money works in this world. 
*"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, dedicated citizens can change the world.  Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." — Margaret Meade*
Now, not everyone can be a revolutionary, or driven/(crazy?) enough to change some of the really big things... but we can change things in our own lives that are within our sphere of influence, simply by changing our state of mind... and the way we look at things and people around us.  
In your example above, if you are not happy with skyrocketing real estate prices, or your 401k...  You can choose to Exit.  You can choose to go out your comfort zone and move to another country just like your American ancestors did when they chose to leave England/Ireland/[insert country here] to find pastures anew.  You could, for instance, buy and move into a house in Spain near the beach, for less than half a bitcoin TODAY.  Same in Portugal or Eastern Europe, India, Ecuador...  You could join a volunteer organisation and do a year out.  You could go do a crowdfund and ask people to back your big idea.
Take material objects and money away and start looking at the world as it truly is (this big old spaceship floating in space with no *real* borders at all) and what do we have then?  Is doing a job you hate for years on end just so you have enough money to buy a porsche or that dream house actually worth it?  
[Hedonic Adaptation]( tells us that the thrill of moving into that house / driving that car will wear off very very quickly — we all revert back to the same level of happiness regardless of the things we acquire.  
So the key to 'happiness', it seems, is a mixture of constant exposure to novelty and new experiences, and accepting that 'happiness' is a fleeting thing; a state of mind that we can be OK with not always being in.  Key is figuring out how to escape a rut when being unhappy becomes a cyclical thing.
Steve Jobs would say: "Every day I ask myself 'if this were the last day of my life, is what I'm about to be doing, what I'd *want* to be doing?'.  If the answer is 'no' enough times in a row, I know it's time to change something in my life."
This hedonic treadmill is why on this journey I've met so many unhappy millionaires in finance (and other jobs) they hate, and yet, I've travelled to places like India and seen unbridled joy on the faces of old folks and street kids, playing together in the slums.  By Western standards these people have 'nothing'...  Except, of course, they have each other, the sun and the stars and, crucially, the time to actually enjoy and appreciate nature and the pulse of life each new day.  
The sun, stars, moon, birds flying high above; these stunning things that those street kids see every day which remind us of our place in the universe... these are things people working infront of a screen, 9-5 in a bland office cubicle in the West may never get to see their entire working life, save for a few fleeting moments on vacation... 
Of course the thing holding people back is fear of going out of our comfort zones... Many of us in the West have been tricked into thinking money, rabid consumerism and cheap entertainment will fix our ills and make us happier, when in fact the best memories we carry are those we have that don't involve money or property or little trinkets.  Your first kiss, waking up to the sunrise, looking at the moon through a telescope for the first time...  Few people say on their deathbeds "I wish I had made more money." but plenty say they wish they had worked less, been kinder to others, travelled more and taken more risks.
My most precious possession?  A necklace my friend made me from a piece of old string and some shells she gathered from the beach.  Not because of any material or aesthetic value, but for the moment it represents and the memories it brings back and the fact that she *made* it.
So yeah, it's a state of mind.  You can change jobs, location, friends, pack all of it up in a backpack and exit... whenever you want to.  You can travel and soak up the sunshine and sit under a blanket of stars and think about your place in it all.  
And reflect on how privileged you are to be able to do that, living in a time where you can be on the other side of the world in less than 24 hours, with a world of geographical and vocational choices just a mouse click away.

It's not in the spirit of co-operation and shows that you perhaps see this as a zero-sum affair which is not very 'charitable'.
I'm sure you meant no harm, but with bitcoin being money, there are many scam artists that the community is hyper sensitive to.  And certainly your actions did cause harm (those other projects people posted deserve the same share of voice yours does).


Building relationships and trust takes time.  Perhaps work on building reputation here and getting to know some people in this space, rather than appearing to be someone who sees this as a 'get rich quick' scheme to fund your project.  You might begin by starting some meetups in Haiti and reaching out to existing well established charities there that have already seeded networks of trust, and may be able to help and advise you with your own setup.
I would suggest [Partners in health]( as a starting point, who are doing amazing things there.  
They don't yet accept bitcoin by the looks of things, why not talk to them about it and see if you can discuss your own project ideas with them?

If you purchase over your computer, then 2FA via SMS is used to validate ownership (mobile phone number is as good as a device id).  
Note I say that when you do FB connect it will check how long you have been friends with this person, so using a fake account is going to fall down here.
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:07:08
Even if this were technically superior to facebook in every aspect, it will not take off for as long as facebook owns the majority of mainstream users and all the years those users have invested in building their profile and friend network.  Not to mention all the sites and apps powered by FB Connect logins now.  
Hell, not even google can compete via the Google+ platform. 
The only way to take on FB will be to offer something that can import your entire FB profile in a matter of seconds and x-post to your old FB profile should users of this new system want to still communicate with their old FB friend network.  
Users would need to be incentivised to do this - offering better privacy would not be enough, it would need to also be more convenient to use this new platform.  Perhaps one that combines twitter, linked.in, reddit and facebook profiles into one glorified bulletproof, truly decentralised p2p network that x-posts all your content across multiple legacy social networks would be one way of gaining widespread adoption?  
This is absolutely doable, but not if the system is centralised, no matter how well-meaning the devs may be, since FB/Twitter et al could shut it down in an instant for ToS violations.
In the meantime, the only way I see Minds gaining any kind of following is if it closely focuses on one particular niche (the activist community perhaps).  Even then though, the kind of people being attracted here are those who are paranoid about data privacy.  These are the exact kind of people who should be wary of trusting all their data with an unproven 3rd party development team, operating via the same centralised server architecture.
@_date: 2015-06-18 21:17:41
I agree but I don't worry too much.  IMO, the ecosystem will find the most elegant solution and it will of course be one that is open-source and decentralised (and therefore impervious to being shutdown even it it does allow importing of 'facebook-owned' user data).
I think of Facebook as I do Napster: a brilliant, mould-breaking tool for connecting people that has shown us what is possible on the internet, but one that has inherent design flaws due to its centralised nature and its business need to generate an income from user data.  Facebook v2 will be more like Bittorrent and users will flock to it in droves as long as the user experience is on a par with FB and there is an easy way to import legacy data.  
In addition I think the concept of 'provable-privacy' will become a thing, much like the recent phenomena of provably fair betting games, especially when Bitcoin opens up micropayment channels as a primary income generator tool for websites and their users.

Yeah, but I think there's a very clever shortcut to solving that problem.
Building a decentralised, open source, p2p version of the facebook connect platform.  
The decentralised version offers developers and users all of the functionality facebook connect does officially (access to friends lists, photos, etc.) but all via p2p with provable privacy controls in place.  This essentially allows users to hand over their FB data to 3rd parties in much the same way as they do now, with the key difference that they can be 100% certain that data being handed over is encrypted and safe from 3rd party exploitation.
What we would then see emerge is a whole host of new services that are ethically minded and user focused.  
We'd see decentralised p2p versions of: tinder, facebook and facebook messenger, meetup, twitter, google+ etc. and, crucially, programmers would finally be able to build a killer social-networking site that acts as the main hub but is controlled by no-one (and even cross-post to all of those 'legacy sites' for those users who are not on main hub yet).
We'd then see an explosion of innovation on the main hub as programmers worked on cool new modules (let's call them hub 'spokes'). 
All without requiring any permission from the various platforms themselves.

The difference between coinbase and paypal, is that coinbase are operating in a completely new monetary paradigm powered by a protocol that is still evolving and a currency that still has an uncertain future.  Granted, if successful it means an end to banking as we know it and a revolution in the way we all think about value transfer.  But that future is a long way off for the majority of the public.  And there are a lot of gatekeepers who are doing just fine with everyone staying in the dark.

I think bitcoin has unleashed a new *demographic* of talent, that is now free to run around 'the playground'.  
A wave of young, imaginative, energetic mavericks that see an industry ripe for disruption where the ordinary rules go out the window and where collaboration and out-of-the-box thinking is encouraged.  There's very much a feeling of anything (and everything) is possible.
Prior to this, the talent in fintech had been locked away in grey buildings, doing 9-5 and subservient to the rules and regulations of lumbering financial giants intent on protecting the existing infrastructure.  The only incentive for innovation in such an environment is a big fat paycheck at the end of each month...and money is hardly ever the best motivator, especially when it comes to encouraging creativity and innovation.

Same, G+ is aesthetically far more pleasing than Facebook, but what's the point when very few of the people I'm friends with are there?  And why would I go to the effort of posting things twice (and learning a new interface) if I can only reach 5% of my friend network on one platform vs. 99% on the other?
This is the crux of the problem and it can't be solved unless we go p2p and circumvent FB et al's ToS to essentially mirror their service in a secure, private, decentralised environment.
The service would import all your friends, contacts and historical posts to a distributed encrypted file shared via something akin to the bittorrent protocol, connect to your existing FB profile to keep you up to date with friends' posts on FB and allow you to x-post to your old FB profile if you choose to.    
There lies the key to building a truly decentralised, censorship resistant, globally connected hive mind that would be impossible to shutdown.
The efforts I'm seeing to date, whilst laudable, fall way too short in getting anywhere near that vision.

I mean I'm a Vegan, this twitter person runs a site called Justmeat.  There's a massive idealogical divide from the outset :p
Likewise, how can he speak for Wall Street traders, when there are a great deal who have been pro-bitcoin virtually from the start?

The moment a CryptoBank launches with bricks and mortar buildings all over the world (specialising in blockchain insurance, securities, IPO's, derivatives, loans, overdrafts and so on) and is able to communicate with legacy banking infrastructure and policy frameworks, is the moment bitcoin launches into the stratosphere.  
Because that means, right then and there they can allow customers to simply transfer their existing bank account / bills / debts straight into the new paradigm without needing to learn any new technology and with the same consumer protections in place that they currently enjoy.  
And people will do it for the same reason people join credit unions, with the additional perk of knowing if they keep X% in BTC they are going to likely see interest on their savings that far eclipse anything the current legacy system offers.

So now you can participate in the bitcoin playground and enjoy zero volatility risk (one of the biggest arguments marring mass bitcoin adoption).  
The only catch of course, is there's still a bank somewhere in this equation.
How long then, I wonder, until CoinBase get the necessary shit together to launch 'CoinBank' and completely transcend the lumbering banking incumbents all together.  Given that multinational BBVA bank invested in their Series C round, I'd say we're not too far away at all...
Then we have BitPay's recent announcement about banks being 'very excited'.  Let's not forget Richard Branson invested in BitPay not too long ago, a guy that has his very own set of banking licences over at Virgin Bank.

That is especially true of those alchemists of the old world being paid to try change conciousness through dusty newspapers no longer relevant to the realtime, global digital world we actually live in.  Hard to teach old dogs new tricks, so accustomed are they to the power that came with that uneven share of voice afforded to them by that old paper belt world... that they are struggling to understand a world where we all have egalitarian access to the truth via *true* democratisation of information and broadcast information networks.
You want these emperors with no clothes to go away, the best approach is to stop giving their OpEd's oxygen.  It's only a matter of time now before that moral arc makes its final bend toward justice either way.

I guess a 'transfer to friend' option could be implemented and your ticket could be moved through the same system with your friend prioritised in the queue when matching you to a buyer.  But something clever would have to be implemented to ensure it wasn't abused as this would enable touts to transfer ownership 'off-chain' so as to speak.  
One basic check that could be done would be to link your FB account and check the person you are transferring to has been on your friend list for X time.  Or perhaps a device ID check that only allows you to do this ownership transfer once every X months would suffice.

Bitcoin is now Coldplay.  We are no longer the cool indie kids swapping bootlegs of Yellow... even if we sometimes feel the crowd might not care about the lyrics, and have no idea how to dance... that doesn't mean we can't be happy for the band now they're playing bigger stadiums :p

Bitcoin, like money, touches every single facet of society.  With so few people who understood why bitcoin was even invented, this gargantuan project has required a lot more than code to get us to where we are today.
Ironically, had it not been for people trying to rush this process, things like sidechains would have been running before a single article in MSM had even been penned.

If you wish to change things you have the power to do so, you must get used to the idea of using the system to exercise your voice.  As more and more tech savvy young people do just that, we see them entering government offices across the world and showing the old guard where they went wrong.  
All that requires effort of course.
There will be no need for "crushing", any more than the myriad reformations that got us to this point in history required uprisings... in fact, arguably, Occupy *was* the west's uprising that began the long process of figuring out how to fix an old, broken system.

Stupid is a very emotive word and if you have fact and reason on your side as a result of the knowledge you have accrued, there's no excuse for belittling others who haven't learnt as much as you have.  It's no different to being a school bully taking the piss out of the 'stupid kid' in class who fell behind on her maths problems.
By virtue of us all being here discussing these issues, we are clearly dealing with highly intelligent people.  Sadly, there are some in this space severely lacking *emotional* intelligence and basic inter-personal skills. 
Whilst it may be fine to call a close friend whom you know well 'stupid' (with a wry smile and a wink) the impersonal nature of online communication means it's incumbent upon us when discussing highly contentious issues, that we do so courteously and with good grace (it's thought 55% of communication is body language, 38% is the tone of voice, and 7% is the actual words spoken).
In doing so, we often expand our own understanding of the complexity of the issues at hand, simply from hearing another viewpoint and forging allies on the other 'side' (even if we don't agree)... Since BCH supporters are themselves concerned with issues like CSW's patent trolling, there is clearly common ground between us all that calls for calm, rational dialogue.  
The core group of Bitcoin aficionados that kickstarted this movement didn't get us all here by calling classical economists stupid (they are anything but).  Rather, it was through objectively weighing up arguments on both 'sides' and appealing to common sense and reason.
Bitcoiners that fail to see the duality in all this are themselves being ~~stupid~~ ignorant :p

It's just a tool, same as pen and paper.  If you read every book in print right now, you would probably end up more stupid than when you began, and certainly would have very little time to make any meaningful impact in the world.
As with browsing books in a public library, the key is learning critical thinking skills, and figuring out how to filter the noise so that you can think for yourself... Then - when you feel you've learnt enough - putting the books (and app feeds) down and taking action by positively contributing to the world... 
We fall down by letting ourselves get caged into a circus of endless 'debates' that have no real bearing on the *actual* work being carried out by those behind the scenes who are far too busy building *the future* to get caught up in a sideshow debating the status quo.

At no point did I say PT is clueless (far from it).  Neither was I alluding to myself when I spoke of the humility of those that have been here the longest (I've only been truly active in this space since 2013).  
Plenty wiser folk than myself been here much longer... and they all seem to have that humility in common.  I guess because they've all seen so many unpredictable things come along noone could have possibly foreseen.
So... If we're in the business of going onstage as talking heads and telling people what to think and feel about the future... we ought have the self awareness and decency to explain to the audience our views are no more important or reliable than anyone else in the crowd, since the entire scope of future possibilities is in the hands of the users (and builders) of this technology, not unelected leaders who - like us all - are going to be prone to subjective biases.
If we have come to the conclusion that we have no idea what will happen... then best to leave it at that, since we don't have enough data (or a crystal ball) to forecast anything that percentage ranges of probability are applicable to.  It's literally just pulling nonsensical numbers out of our arse for the sake of a soundbite or two.
In doing so, we give the false impression we *do* have an insight into exactly how the adjacent possible is going to unfold.  When in actual objective reality, it is clear that nobody does or possibly ever can.

The best way to change the government is from within.  You will find many politicians and civil servants working in the light who are as excited by what all this means for humanity as we all are.  They too look at the same stars and contemplate existence, have kids and husbands and wives that are students, doctors, teachers.  Many have simply lacked the tools and imagination to think about more creative solutions to problems.
The Renaissance came through truth and beauty carried by art and music.
Peaceful, calm, rational dialogue and relentless optimism is the true route to changing things for the better.

Well, I mean, if he's talking about an education system that prepares our children (and their brains) for mindless drudgery then the answer to his question is "you already do it."  
"We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. **The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.**" — Buckminster Fuller
Sounds to me like the world would be a much better place if Munger and his ilk took Bucky's advice and go back to school.
Maybe he could start by addressing his technological illiteracy and [learning to code](
Until then, our stock response to ignorant people telling us what to think and feel about something they do not themselves yet understand ought be "Do you actually know anything about computer science?  Have you ever used a bitcoin wallet?  Can you code?  Do you know what a BIP is?" etc.
If the answers are no, asking their opinions on all this is akin to asking the Janitors working at the large hadron collider what they think about the latest detailed specification drafts for the worldwide LHC compute grid.
Most of those janitors would of course be humble enough to shrug and say "not my field of expertise or interest, but if you want to know about how toilet plumbing works, I'm your gal"...

We have to be careful about ramming messages down people's throats in a world already saturated by noise. Bitcoin got here without hard sell, people will come when they're ready to find it; we do not need to weave the same dark magic to brute force this change.
Bitcoin is not a pancea to the community erosion we've seen propelled by mass marketing and over consumption; it's just a tool that helps us do things faster. 
IMO, better to showcase local grassroots initiatives, music, events, art, live tweets (which may include local bitcoin meetups)... These are the very *real* things that truly bring people together and help empower people across all social strata.
If you're in London do take a look at the gigantic Google screen above old Street roundabout that does this already, and the many iPhone ads that are focusing on art and photography from *real* users, for a glimpse into how things are getting fixed.

At this juncture it doesn't matter whether we're moving money in and out of fiat, bitcoin or any other crypto as long as we're building things and learning faster than that old world tied up in red tape can allow.
Which, given the massive online infrastructure development, real world businesses, university courses, new ways of thinking about global value and *real* wealth all this is all inspiring and generating it's good to sometimes step back and look at the bigger ontological picture, lest we miss seeing the wood for the trees.

It's all about providing the most elegant, secure and joyous UX to the end user.  That is best arrived at through multiple brains collaborating on the same mission plan, much like core do on something wayyyyy more complex than a basic infrastructure surface like a wallet (or even, exchange - all of which essentially do the same thing differently).
That doesn't mean there can't be white labelled versions and different skins (like say, WinAmp back in the day).  But it does mean scammers and just flat out bad designers can't compromise unwitting users funds, because we know the underlying wallet source is maintained to the same standards as the bitcoin core repository.
It also means ordinary people would be able to submit Wallet Improvement Proposals to a diverse team capable of implementing great ideas across the entire ecosystem with one update push.

Corporations are just groups of people with a common goal.  Some make that goal all about money and believe business ought to be ruthless, other groups make their goal about discovery and the betterment of humankind. 
If you're own understanding of the world is born of a zero sum mentality and the ruthless pursuit of money it may be difficult to understand that not all companies share that dog eat dog worldview.  If they did we'd never see non profit foundations or grassroots initiatives like bitcoin.
I remember when the CEO of Yahoo was asked what her primary aim was many years ago: "to increase revenues for shareholders" was the response.  When Google were asked the same thing, the reply was "to make sense of all the world's information."
The Wright brothers, Nikola Tesla... None of these people were motivated by money.  Neither is Ray Kurzweil (now chief of Google engineering).
Google came up with the corporate philosophy "don't be evil" which today, has been further evolved to "do the right thing".  Alphabet and Google have done more to embrace all this and champion open source movements than any tech companies on the planet.

This is for the ecosystem to decide.  Atomic swaps and rootstock will allow a multitude of niche cryptos and tokenised assets to co-exist, using bitcoin as the underlying settlement layer. 
Indeed, many of the existing alts / tokens are already prepping for layer 2 and relishing the new opportunities ahead.
There will be all kinds of use cases: e.g. local currencies in townships in Africa powering a grassroots makers economy, crowd owned websites, the machine payable web, digitised stock markets for traditional company flotations, digital customer loyalty schemes, social network capital, IoT... to name but a few.
All of them will require some kind of niche ledger off the main chain untethered to bitcoin as a unit of account, but reliant on Bitcoin as a trusted, tamper-proof settlement layer.
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:58:26
There will likely be great need for all kinds of localised currencies and token schemes built through sidechains.  For example, I envisage practically every existing fiat currency having a digital version rolled out in lieu of humanity getting used to the idea of trading in bits.
Likewise, I imagine LETS style adhoc economies springing up in various towns and villages.  Such experiments will need all kinds of different rulesets and mechanisms for shielding from the underlying global currency which is susceptible to external market forces.
We can therefore think of these 'alts' running on layer 2 (but settled on layer 1 through atomic swaps via bitcoin) as websites running on IPv4.  
That *is* building on the foundation.  By doing so we move away from this whole 'blockchain' hype and more toward actual products and services that can be built on top of the base layer which has been firmly established as *the* blockchain.
Then it's for the ecosystem to decide which of those layer 2 projects have merit.

I adore Nick, he saw the much bigger picture of all this right from day one, but Tom Lee has a greater handle I feel on the nuances at play here.
I could be wrong, but seems to me this is not just about volume of searches from everyday users... sure, the sheer number of folks onboarding via the FOMO hype train was an incredibly important 'ordinary' user drive last year, but what we're seeing now is computer nerds (with high net worth) finally grokking all this.
2013 (when Nick arrived) felt like the 2nd wave of computer science innovators (like Andreas) collectively getting behind all this...  3rd wave feels like now... That's a big deal: this is a demographic whom are extremely well paid, and also one that - unlike many of those FOMOing - can see for themselves the long-term technical utility behind the science of this, and what it means for the industry and the internet as a whole.
When they onboard, they should also help pull up all those from Q4 last year currently on the exchange fence poised to buy back...

I don't think art and education should be driven by subliminally implanting messages.  That is, afterall, exactly what advertisers do to stimulate artificial needs and wants.
Instead, such a system ought to be asking the crowd in its entirety what they want to see...
That way the wisdom of crowds gets to decide, which is not all that different to how old world town planning meetings work, it's just that an entire generation is excluded from those meetings due to an inter generational (and digital) divide.
Building a system accessible to both 'sides' of that divide ensures the makeup of the area becomes a reflection of the creative output and diversity of all the citizenry, where everyone feels they have a say in the evolving aesthetic which gives everyone involved an incentive far greater than profit motive, leading to a greater sense of pride and ownership that comes with having an equal share of voice.

We are likely moving to a world governed by the consent of well informed crowds.  I mean, when a single tweet can start the Arab Spring, we are arguably already there.
As Ed Snowden tweeted awhile back "It was once impossible to imagine a world without the rule of kings and queens.  One day we'll be saying the same about prime ministers and presidents."
To get there, it begins with individuals taking responsibility for their own actions and to stop asking for permission to fix things.  
That requires us all taking responsibility for our own wealth instead of leaving that job to a select few unelected representatives in private corporations and institutions, who have shown time and time again they can't be trusted, neither with our wealth and money management, or the technologies that underpin all this that they barely understand.

The issue is those that have a deep understanding of all this and truly care about the technology rarely get off on the thought of telling people what to think via a YouTube talking heads channel... 
There are rare exceptions like Andreas Antonopoulos who has taken years away from coding to educate on Bitcoin, but the rest of the engineers and scientists in this space are busy working on the *actual* science.
**Note how Andreas' channel carries no advertising, no promotions or price discussion; how his mastering bitcoin book was released for free online, and how he originally relied solely on patreon donations to keep going.  This is how we are able to discern those with true integrity in love with knowledge and technology vs. those who are just a digitised echo mimicking agenda-driven MSM entertainment platforms.**
It's crucial to assess these hidden (often unconscious) agendas / biases when allowing  subjective YouTube discussions to inform your worldview.
Luckily, it's the science that will do the real talking in the end... and these kinds of noisy YouTube videos from armchair commentators will be consigned to the dusty recesses of history... whereas the technology itself will continue to evolve through crowd governed consensus well into the future.

Well it's possible bitcoiners got a little too big for their boots (what with the silly lambo stunt and paid for demonstrations)... and the invisible hand of the market that requires EVERYONE to get onboard this crazy train, saw some grumpy old boomers (a little put off at the over exuberant millennial hubris) giving us all a little bit of a slap :p
That said, iirc, you should all take note that Tom Lee actually said the price hike usually happens in the WEEKS AFTER consensus.
It's also going to take time for people and organisations (especially those that didn't attend) to digest all the video content and think deeply about the only thing that really matters: the technology.
Lesson from all this: bitcoin doesn't need paid for publicity stunts, especially if they can be seen by a certain demographic as antagonistic.  And it certainly doesn't need a lambo parade (no matter how tongue in cheek) that make us all look like a new elite bragging about the size of our abs... As boring as this may be, we ought focus instead on the very real social good this technology is enabling.  
An outside stall / exhibition stand showing the pineapple fund, helping educate passersby (i.e ordinary folk) would have been far more effective publicity wise and would pique *positive* interest across all social strata. 
Let's hope next year we have a (non paid for) Tesla parade and organic flash mobs that use positive art, music and humour to show how bitcoin can unite everyone :)

Bitcoin was built with this love; the creation was the reward.  Being able to tell future generations you were part of building something that helped save humanity, that is the reward.
As a result it's been running for 9 years without missing a heartbeat.
This love and passion is infectious; and has seen this movement quietly gather an army of supporters... spread out across the globe from every socioeconomic strata imaginable... and these supporters have proven time and time again they will do whatever it takes to ensure bitcoin succeeds.

More often than not we're dealing with ignorance, not stupidity.
Insulting someone in this fashion is counter intuitive; it immediately gets them worked up into fight or flight making it much more difficult to get over the ensuing cognitive dissonance.
A much more effective way to phrase this would be "You're too intelligent to believe x".
The compliment will release dopamine, and make them feel more valued.  In this reduced state of anxiety, we are then more able to weigh up new information that questions our understanding of the world.

Well, I can only talk from my experience of being here the first time around and having built and scaled internet sites from zero to millions of users over the last 15 years... Invariably that was best achieved with code optimisation and carefully planned load balancing as opposed to simply rolling out bigger, faster, stronger tech... 
I'm also very conscious of the many mistakes we all made along the way building those sites... chiefly because of having to pander to the interests of the big business crowd that know nothing about computer science.  
I'm tired of that - we don't let the janitors or the electricity company preside over the science teams working at the large hadron collider, so why should VCs and salesmen dictate over computer science decisions?
Of course, if you believe there's a better way, this is all designed in such a way you're welcome to try.  Just be wary of ramming 'your way' down others throats, especially when it's clear users will be the ultimate arbiters in all this.
If nothing else the 'my way is better than your way' debate is very boring... Most of us have moved on.
Perhaps then, rather than fighting over the intricacies of the technology (afterall IP was far from perfect) good developers ought work with what we already have and think about how these new tools can already be wielded to create amazing solutions for those users.
That's happening already of course and I've been blown away by some of the prototypes I've already seen that solve much bigger problems than simply moving monetary value around.

It's more down to a lack of imagination...
"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution." — Einstein
When the survival of the species requires we change the rules of the game it is those with imagination and creativity that are best able to harness new ways of thinking and sharing information to pull us away from the status quo.  These are the "1 in 10,000" Bucky Fuller talks about who are capable of "pulling the entire of humanity forward".
Eric Weinstein made a distinction between two very different kinds of people in this scenario: the “excellent” and the “remarkable”. 
The former, he says, have optimized for playing and winning the current dominant game. They have gone to the best schools. They have worked at the best institutions. They have excelled. Echoing evolutionary theory, he calls them “hill climbers” – and if you need to climb a hill, they are the right people to call.
But if the challenge is not to climb some well understood hill, but to cross the “adaptive valley” of the unknown, the excellent are woefully unprepared. If you need to wander through uncertainty in search of an as yet poorly understood but potentially vastly superior game, you need to call on an entirely different kind of person: the remarkable.

When Steve Jobs got going with Apple they, like bitcoin, were underdogs.  Were it not for the ardent support of 1000s of spirited hardcore geeks in the early days, the iPhone would still be just another crazy idea scribbled in the back of a dusty old notebook.  I like to think that if Steve were still alive today, he would already be busy behind the scenes trying to work out how he can capitalise on the marvellous new opportunities in innovation that bitcoin brings to the fore.
And, just like he pushed the record labels to drop DRM, I imagine he would already be changing the rules of the App store to embrace bitcoin.  Why?  Because Steve knew that if you tried to fight progress, you die.
Sadly, Apple no longer have his genius to turn to, so we are left with a bunch of lumbering pen-pushers and right-hand men who don't know the first thing about progress, especially when it means rewriting rules to your own eco-system.
The only surprise/outrage I have is that Apple - a company that I once admired if only for their beautiful, cutting-edge products - have failed so badly to do anything, even slightly innovative since Steve departed.  Instead, they have been left holding the baby, desperately trying to keep the shareholders happy in the absence of new ideas, by squeezing every last cent out of the few remaining assets they have left - and to hell with Steve's legacy/company ethics/long-term future.

The economy is beyond our comprehension yes, which is exactly why we've gotten into this mess.  No longer can any one human or group of humans with hierarchical networks fathom the flow of information.  And money is just that, information.
Of course there was a time when connecting all the computers in the world and allowing information to flow freely was just as terrifying to custodians of a pre-internet / printing press world.  Remember the clerics that fought the likes of Galileo?
What about old world telecommunications providers and rentiers that fought Skype and AirBnB (both services were once illegal)...  The list is endless... Taxi drivers Vs Uber, Napster Vs. the Music industry (which pivoted into Spotify via Sean Parker), YouTube Vs. Viacom, Blockbuster Vs. Netflix...
Whilst those early innovators lead the charge, it has taken *everyone* in old world and new to figure out how to make all this work.  Bitcoin is no different.
The end result is no less transformative than the internet itself.

There is, infact, a heck of a lot *more* going on.  I've been to enough of them in my time.  And yes, they're organised through secret and closed Facebook groups as are many activist movements, including a whole bunch of Bitcoin and crypto groups that are closed.  
As for whether that's all being watched, I guess that depends on the members and whether authorities have learnt their lessons from things like the criminal justice bill (it appears they have).  
I know of a number of well organised secret forest raves for instance, that rarely get closed down nowadays.  It just depends on whether the organisers have a reputation for being peaceful and respectful and clean up after themselves.
Indeed, even during the London riots, and Occupy (which were all organised via social media) there was never a crackdown on social media groups in the UK.  The concern is more with private entities like Cambridge Analytica abusing these tools (and peoples' privacy) for profit.
More and more impromptu raves and festivals are also happening with permission of land owners (many of those land owners are our generation now, afterall).
All of this was of course inevitable the faster and more free information exchange became.  We have Tim Berners-Lee and the internet and music / video sharing services to thank for that.
TL;DR: Information will always find a way to be free. Get with the times (fellow) old man! :p

Really depends on your disposition.  I don't understand how people could find a cartoon of Mohammed offensive or how fundamentalist Christians would find a picture of two guys kissing offensive - but they do.  
Some people view religious texts and what they preach as *the* greatest evil on this Earth and, when you look at the division, war and poverty that those WORDS can often cause, it's perhaps understandable.  
He could argue that religious clerics have caused more harm and misery to children in this world than any paedophile, and certainly in terms of the numbers of children killed in all the wars committed in religions name, he'd have a point.    
Ergo, he has as much right to be as outraged by someone pushing those words onto the blockchain (and down his throat) as you do over illegal photos of children or a fundamentalist Muslim does over photos depicting the Prophet Mohammed.
It is not for you to stamp his views with a moral barometer and tell him which evil is greater any more than it is mine.

Of course the vision here has to be an internet without ads, which is one of the first things bitcoin is set to bring about if we all get this right with Layer 2/3.  Google surely see this; the ideas behind Brave browser aren't happening in a vacuum, and they maintain the Chromium project it's based on afterall... I guess they just need scaling solutions to roll out for that vision to be practicable for an organisation the size of Google.
Let's hope them simply banning all crypto ads is the first step to this immunisation process (which should take care of the phishing sites in one fell swoop).

Steve Baker MP (who tabled the debate) had hoped for a full discussion on the merits of crypto currency, and was hoping to reinforce his views on the importance of avoiding regulatory measures in the crypto space.  However, it became obvious that no-one there knew enough about crypto to even begin debating those points.
So, they mostly ignored crypto altogether and ended up debating the role of banks, banking regulations, Q.E and lamenting the fact that the average MP doesn't have the faintest idea how money is actually created.


Eventually, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Andrea Leadsom) turned up and briefly mentioned the importance of supporting crypto currency innovation, before dropping this:


The Treasury are currently seeking advice and guidance on crypto before officially announcing any recommendations.  
What hope we can have for them having a clear understanding of the crypto world when the average MP - by their own admittance - doesn't understand how FIAT money is created, is up for conjecture.  
Steve Baker is on the treasury though, has an MSc in Computer Science and has actually used bitcoin, so perhaps there is hope yet :)

My first project on the interwebs looked exactly like bandcamp.  It was 12 years too early.  The technology, and society as a whole was not yet ready, but I learnt some invaluable lessons.  The first being patience and understanding everything is about timing ;)
Just as the world needed bandcamp and it was clear from the outset that the internet could provide it, there's a clear need for things like decentralised identity which bitcoin will eventually solve.  
Lots of people are getting ahead of themselves before the nuts and bolts of the base technology have been properly cemented by trying to solve everything with 'blockchain', just as I got ahead of myself with the bandcamp idea before we even had ubiquitous broadband or viable streaming protocols.  
The solutions will come through blockstack, rootstock, lightning, and sidechains running over bitcoin as the defacto settlement layer.  Those scientists who have been here the longest and see how we've all been here before can see this, which is why people like Tim Berners-Lee tweeted their blockstack ID's out some two years ago...
In the meanwhile people without that experience are going to get all excited and make lots of mistakes just as I and many of my colleagues did during the dotcom years.  That's ok.  It's all part of growing up, finding your way and having fun tinkering with things.  Main thing is we all keep learning from each other and stay humble.
In the grand scheme of things, the *people* working on those alts are very much going to be a vital part in helping shape this nascent industry in the future and yes, they are all part of the ecosystem figuring out the optimal way forward.


Bitcoin needed the malleability fixes that came with Segwit to make lightning possible and, more importantly, it needed consensus to bring them about.  A lot was learnt along the way as to exactly how (and by whom) that consensus is arrived at.  This setback actual development and adoption a long way because it meant computer scientists who would otherwise be coding, spent an inordinate amount of time writing essays and convening conference discussions in order to convince people this was the right approach to scaling.


Don't think that small programming groups are necessarily a hindrance.  We've a saying in programming circles "what one programmer can do in a month, two can do in two months" ;)
As with all workgroups, it's nearly all to do with how well the group can work together as a team and how committed they all are to the same plan.  It can often take just one person to upset the entire balance which is why bigger teams != better outcomes (and why so many agile small startups are able to take on lumbering incumbents and their huge workforces).

By that time, there would be no need for WU (or any agents) acting as intermediaries at all.  It would be like the postal service offering to print out your emails and bring them to your door for a fee.  Or Blockbuster installing pay as you go Netflix booths in their stores.
Are the postal service / blockbuster / taxi firms kicking themselves now for not adapting quickly enough to shifting consumer trends brought on by new technology?  Or is it perhaps just a natural state of entropy that when corporations get too large and unwieldy they do their damnedest to defend the status quo they're invested in, as opposed to proactively exploring and taking advantage of new threats (and hence, opportunities).

This could be seen as paving the way toward a cashless society.  Kinda' like blockbuster video handing out Netflix loyalty cards whilst preparing for a dignified exit?
In the interim, perhaps this is a necessary transition on the road to incumbents understanding where Layer 2 takes us next. 
Certainly, it helps legitimise crypto amongst older generations and, in doing so, makes bitcoin more accessible to inter-generational wealth.

I think many are looking at it more as a high interest savings account that, for the first time in the history of the world, is enabling mass global social mobility at an unprecedented rate.
This is actually a beautiful wealth exchange between two generations hitherto separated by a digital divide.
Those on both sides of the divide who see this who are patient and cautious, have an incredible opportunity to free up wealth that had, until this juncture, been tied up with red tape.


The aeroplane, computer, radio, internet, bitcoin are politically and idealogically neutral *technologies*.  Tools that conform to laws of physics and mathematics.  They do not care about dusty old ists and isms from a past that didn't see those technologies coming along.
Being a global phenomenon used across all social strata in this hyper connected digital world, bitcoin will always remain agnostic to such human pretensions.

Yep, it's just the iPhone walled garden app store all over again that results in the entire planet getting DRM'd for the sake of quick convenience and "bigger, faster, stronger" rollouts from companies that think life and business has to be a race to some sort of finish line.
Since the speed of communication in this space seems to be running 15x faster than the old pre-Twitter / YouTube world these tech companies were born in, I'd be surprised if this idea (that misses the point of *actual* decentralised, consensus based solutions) gains much traction.
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:24:17
To be fair, Keynes had no idea this thing called the internet would come along that removes the need for fallible central planners to create nonsensical jobs most people don't want to be doing...  
Instead it offloads all that brainpower to the wisdom of well informed crowds who are free - through consensus - to deploy their collective global energy for the betterment of all... without needing to seek that permission from gatekeepers, to work on things we all collectively agree is a good idea.

The future is going to be a lot more interesting than that.
You can already get bitcoin loans btw, issued instantly with no credit checks.
Nexo announced the other day, and you can even keep making money on bitcoin you've cashed if BTC goes up in value.
Great silicon valley team behind it too.  But they're just stepping stones to something much, much grander...
Eventually, we'll likely all be thinking in terms of bits and there will be no need to use fiat on/off ramps or worry about loans - you'll simply crowdfund everything through social capital linked to things like global identity web of trust networks built on tech like blockstack.
The concept of ownership is going to change; the idea of being stuck in the same house or job for twenty years or being tied to material objects will become rather passé for a globally hyper connected generation able to work from anywhere.  People will be free to explore the world, and, later explore inner and outer space.  
The sharing economy will be the backbone of all this.  Using a car, boat or vacant airbnb won't require anything but a smartphone swipe (or facial recognition gesture linked to your Global Blockstack ID).  It would automatically ratify your trust rank, driving credentials etc.
Your friends will all be on a Google map, you'll be able to see them in real-time and, with little to no emphasis on work and timetables, life will become much more fluid; multiple serendipitous moments will be engineered as your friends come and go freely.  You'll meet strangers this way too of course.
That future is a way off (a decade maybe), it comes through lightning and decentralised exchanges, sidechains and a very, very gradual process that will see the internet and then real world retail outlets using dual pricing on items for sale.  
When the money part of bitcoin becomes as pedestrian as the technology of debit cards (which were also lampooned initially) then the internet as we know it is going to be completely changed through micropayment tech.  That's when all this starts to really amp up, as multiple crowdfunding projects bolstered by global web of trust networks begin to enable that bold new future to unfurl at an exponential rate... This leads to a new golden age and the onset of the technological singularity.
Sounds crazy, but then the internet's only been here a few decades, and smartphones are less than one decade old.
Today's world is equally impossible to believe to someone who still remembers a time before text messages ;)

I very much doubt he would be mocking it when you have Bill Gates and other contemporary tech luminaries calling Bitcoin "a technological tour-de-force".  Aggressive visionary, yes, but Jobs, just like Gates would have recognised the beauty of what Bitcoin is, and the world of possibilities it opens up (currency is just the start). Can there be any real net benefit in trying to stifle its rise at this juncture?
He was instrumental in turning the music industry around on DRM and if there was anyone who could see outside the box and move the company with any sort of agility it was surely him.
But, I guess we'll never know for sure.

This.  
Presently younger generations are grappling with an old paperbelt world they don't understand and have little interest in getting involved with... since the thought of filling in paperwork and jumping through hoops to move their economic energy around is insanely archaic to them.
When youngsters who grew up as digital natives can invest easily in stocks of companies (and crowdfunds) they believe are making the world a better place, such as Tesla stocks, by simply pushing BTC into those endeavours with a smartphone swipe... we will begin to see a huge shift in capital moving toward more ethical, sustainable businesses.  These generations do care deeply about fixing the problems they have inherited, but until now they've been largely impotent in being able to solve them because of economic capital that's been frozen by red tape. 
A year from now the (largely junk) Alt Coin market may well look more like the Fortune 500 with *real* businesses (both old world and new) listed alongside their realtime 24/7 crypto stock tickers.  In that respect, we might consider the current landscape a 'dry run' for much more exciting developments ahead.  Indeed, companies like Binance already have the tech infrastructure and reach to make this a reality.
Older generations need to get to grips with all this too, and there's no reason they won't since all of this is merely an extension of UX principles firmly established by the myriad smartphone apps they're already comfortable using.
Props to Giancarlo for recognising all this and the need to share the baton with a tech savvy generation who mean to do good with this technology.

“Eric Weinstein made a distinction between two very different kinds of people: the “excellent” and the “remarkable”. The former, he says, have optimized for playing and winning the current dominant game. They have gone to the best schools. They have worked at the best institutions. They have excelled. Echoing evolutionary theory, he calls them “hill climbers” – and if you need to climb a hill, they are the right people to call.
But if the challenge is not to climb some well understood hill, but to cross the “adaptive valley” of the unknown, the excellent are woefully unprepared. If you need to wander through uncertainty in search of an as yet poorly understood but potentially vastly superior game, you need to call on an entirely different kind of person: the remarkable.” — Jason Silva

You just simply can't state as FACT that Jeff_R hasn't read the bible when  you have absolutely ZERO empirical evidence to support your claim.  
His decision to remain silent when questioned does not impart absolute guilt, only suspicion, just as a suspects decision to exercise his right to remain silent in a murder trial could never be used as absolute 'proof' that he committed said crime.

The radical transparency bitcoin brings to public purses via a global, immutable, public ledger that no-one can cheat is the *real* breakthrough here.  It's this crowd-lead scrutiny backed up by a decentralised governance system that cannot be subverted by the powerful, that leads to a truly egalitarian sharing of wealth.  The digits themselves in that ledger are virtually meaningless; it's what we collectively decide to do with them that matters.  In the meantime we have to accept that the initial distribution is going to be chaotic and uneven until the ecosystem figures out how to get us to that Type I Civilisation.  Much like all those interconnected hard drives on the early internet gave birth to a truly chaotic information sharing frenzy before things like the Mosaic browser (and later Google) came along to help us make sense of it all...
Bitcoin is *the* stepping stone toward a world computer running a resource based economy that *truly economises* and where money as we understand it today is no longer needed (due to us all coming to the realisation we live in a world of abundance). 
It will take time to get there; humanity has a lot more to learn (and unlearn)... but keep in mind [this is the end game](  How we get there is up to the whole of humanity to decide.

You may not be aware, but the second person to begin coding on bitcoin was Mike Hearn (a Google security chief).  He worked on Bitcoin in his 20% time, put together an internal email group of some 400 Googlers to discuss and help shape the technology.  He would also regularly report to Larry Page on developments.  He went on to leave Google and go full-time on bitcoin.  
Charlie Lee who created litecoin is also an ex Googler.
Google are not perfect, but people like Mike, Charlie and other Googlers have done more to protect our data and our rights, and champion open source technology than any other tech company on the globe.  
When we move to a web no longer powered by advertising, I can easily envisage Google becoming one of the world's first fully autonomous companies owned and governed by the crowd, or even AI ;)
Indeed, the first time I heard the concept of a Distributed Autonomous Organisation was through one of Mike's lectures.

What about when Apple went after PC users, Microsoft, IBM?
Or when Samsung trolled Apple with their brilliant piss take of iPhone fanboys?
The list goes on...Are you saying it's OK for those big companies to troll their competition because they have large marketing budgets and a fleet of lawyers, but if the bitcoin community dare employ similar tactics then it's all of a sudden off-limits / over the top company bashing? 
The fact is, there was just one ad before WU got all their big boy pants in a tizz this morning.  It was WU that went after and tried to silence the little guys via legal threats (for using similar tactics, as a community, that any of their competitors would).
That tactic has now clearly backfired, and the bitcoin community are rightly enjoying their 5 minutes of good natured payback (you will note that every parody ad upvoted so far is humorous and tongue in cheek).
I'm sure WU will survive just fine without the need for your impassioned defence.
And we should all remember that, ultimately, whatever your thoughts on the methods, this ad going viral *has* done a great deal of good in raising bitcoin awareness among the uninitiated.  Any publicity is good publicity as they say (and I'm sure that goes for WU too - this is probably the first and only ad they've ever seen go viral).
Why not rejoice in the fact that this community is full of brilliantly talented people who are keen to lend a hand in all aspects of spreading bitcoin awareness and acceptance?  Afterall, WU probably paid upwards of $200k for their ad, wheras we got ours for free.

I agree pag_el that this has nothing to do with platforms/performance or any other tech evangelist nonsense…However, the bitcoin community response to this is far from a child spitting its dummy out and more akin to the bullied kid in the playground being punched one too many times before shouting enough is enough.
I also agree with your final point "don't give apple your money."  So how best to hit them in the, ahem, wallet?  Raise awareness through viral videos and civil disobedience (even if that means smashing up phones in a rather OTT fashion).  The more people who hear the message (including apple execs) the more likely we are going to effect some kind of change.  And if only a handful of people choose to ditch their iPhones as a result of exposure bought by bitcoiners venting their rage, then we have done more than any petition could possibly hope to achieve.
Disclosure: I made this on a mac.  I love macs but have decided as a result of their proprietary iTunes bullshit and, more importantly, the disgusting treatment of FoxConn workers, that this will be the last one I buy (hackintosh all the way after this).  This latest crap from them is just the nail in the coffin on what I once revered as an amazing company.
I gave up on iPhones some 3 or 4 years ago btw: built in obsolescence (why can't I swap the battery out, why can't I use a universal charger?) and the fact that their screens seemed to have the same breaking-limit as tissue paper (once went through 3 in a year) meant I switched to android a long time ago (and boy am I glad I did now).

The sub is as chaotic as the ebb and flow of the market; there will be weeks when it's full of memes; weeks when it's flamewar posts; others when it's mostly full on tech discussion...  All depends what's going and what the crowd freely votes to the top.
Few people realise that, since there is (quite rightly) no central bitcoin marketing division, memes going viral are, at least in part, the very reason so many people have found (and continue to find) bitcoin.
If you have issues with the somewhat disordered nature of the Reddit, you will find a whole bunch of forums dedicated to various technical discussions over at [bitcointalk.org]( all nicely ordered.

The problem is, in doing so, they are giving oxygen to bitcoin.  It is in their best interests at this juncture to keep it as underground as possible, in the hope that regulations/some other event will ultimately strangle bitcoin's potential.  
It will be the younger, more agile and less risk averse companies that eventually replace WU with BTC insured services and the like, not entrenched incumbents that would have a hard time justifying such a massive shift in focus to existing shareholders.

I remember when I was once caught by my English teacher reading a computer book many moons ago.  He attempted to embarrass me in front of the class by telling me with absolute certainty "The sooner you get your head out of computers and into Shakespeare the better; computers are nothing more than a passing fad".
I could have countered his argument by simply pointing at the ubiquity of  calculators on our desks, or the fact that without computers we wouldn't have landed on the moon.  Quite how this old man couldn't see the obvious was beyond me, but we had long surpassed the need for me to 'defend' computers in an attempt to convince him otherwise, so at 12 years old I simply retorted with this:

Yeah I agree, then on the other end of the spectrum you have Minecraft.  
Somewhere between Second Life, EVE, Elite, WoW, GTA and Minecraft lies the ultimate MMORPG where the players are building and coding the universe themselves and where anything is possible: a game that mimics life itself but has no boundaries and no limits beyond the imagination of the players taking part.  
I see a future not too distant now where people will opt to have a *real* second - virtual - life, with friend circles unbounded by real-world geography where user generated products such as houses, clothing, factories, cars, spaceships and even planets and territory are all up for ownership backed by fully realised in-game market economies, political rulesets, natural resource allocation etc.  
The rules of the game would require mining operations, resource transfer, vendors, inventors, business owners, trading entities and so forth...In-game careers such as couriers, bar tenders, army contractors, programmers, designers, 3D artists, inventors, drugs traffickers, stock brokers, entertainers, even politicians and PR agents...
All of this is at least technically feasible to create virtually, but hitherto we have lacked a frictionless means of being able to reward players monetarily in real life for their efforts.  Could we create an artificial world where the average player might earn more than the minimum wage tending virtual tables in a virtual cafe?  Where a player could apply skills he or she has in the real world to contribute to building a virtual in-game business empire?  
I think we are only a decade or two away from this.  I mean, could we have imagined WoW 20 years ago when the most sophisticated game of its time was [Elite II?](

But I don't think OP is suggesting we go back to the days of punch card ATM's: He/she is simply pointing out how tech we take for granted today was once showcased as something completely alien to the average person, in the same way that 2-Way bitcoin ATM's being shown for the first time in contemporary news broadcasts are being met with a similar WTF raised eyebrow by the non-bitcoin initiate.  
Should crypto ATM's become ubiquitous a decade or so down the line, the average person will indeed look back to footage of the early launches with a wry smile (as they swipe their Trezor wallet over the auto-drone that just delivered their $10,000 [0.1btc] Amazominoes pizza).

Way I envisage future systems working: multi-sig keys hosted at more than one super secure storage vault in separate geographical locations, requiring the beneficiary and one signature from either storage entity for release.
That way if one vault gets hit, your coins are still secure.  
Obviously they could bolt on indemnity services on top of the storage fees so that your coins are fully insured against loss.
In fact, that's about the only real world use I can think of for the soon to be deprecated banking institutes :p

What alternative could you possibly offer to the bitcoin ecosystem when you only own an app store and a mere 1/5th of the smartphone market?  Could Apple compete with the 1000s of nerds all tirelessly building infrastructure around bitcoin (ATMs, Exchanges, PR, Lobbying politicos in every country in the world, etc. etc.).  It's like telling customers they can no longer use email apps because apple are planning on launching a new apple-only version of the POP3 protocol and hoping everyone else in the world will convert over.


Exactly, so it was a sound business decision, but he had to make some very tough decisions to make that happen and it pissed off a lot of old dinosaurs and scared a lot of people (including shareholders) at Apple.  Bitcoin is very similar, in that Apple have no stake in protecting the interests of credit/debit card companies that currently make $100s of millions a year in transaction fees from app store purchases.  And, just like Paypal and WU are thinking of adding bitcoin as a payment instrument, long-term, it would make sense for the App store to do the same, with the added bonus of enabling frictionless in-app micro transactions/alleviating identity fraud etc.)  
Would Steve have seen that before others?  I'd say, with his experience, understanding and love of technology, the answer is yes.

It indicates no such thing as consensus; the more MP's present, the more questions arise, the more opinions are weighed, ideas tested...This is an opening debate and as such it needs a broad range of speakers and listeners to actively participate.  As for the issue being non-controversial or a consensus being agreed: if you read the transcript in full you will see that this is not the case at all.  How could the question of radically reforming 'who gets to create our money' be non-controversial?


The Hansard transcript details many of the MP's present expressing their dismay at there being such a low turnout for this debate.
Indeed, it is only by going to the debates, taking an interest, asking questions and meeting with those afterwards (often in the commons bars) that one gets a greater grasp and understanding on the issues at hand (not by passively listening to a BBC Parliament broadcast whilst going through your emails/filofax/luncheon invites).
So no, the fact the nobody is there, is not a good thing at all.  But at least, as Zac says, we are having the opening debate.

If you found the original tongue-in-cheek comment pointless, perhaps you missed the point.  Even if BTC goes to a value of $10,000 which is certainly plausible within the next few years, whether it behaves like a future currency or is more akin to an asset bubble waiting to burst will still be open to endless debate.  Further, whether its tax determination falls into currency or asset class  will have major implications on your returns and how it's treated for the purchase of goods and services.
Not as succinct as my original comment but, meh, bitcoin.

Personally, I think altcoins are providing a much needed sandbox for those who were late to the party to throw around ideas and play with the technology.  Meanwhile *the* blockchain matures to the point where layer 2/3 tech will enable ideas and talent currently working on those altcoin sandboxes to eventually come back to the original chain and hit the ground running on layer 2 dev.
At that point, bitcoin will settle down, and this whole battleground of ideas will begin anew in the sidechain space.
What a nightmare it would be right now if core (and the mempool!) didn't have this vital alt coin "load balancing" ;)
Exactly the same happened on the internet i.e. the initial fight was about open internet vs. closed intranets... the game then moved onto websites after it became self evident to the world that, despite its messy and chaotic beginnings, the internet was where the vast majority of ordinary people wanted to congregate.
With that in mind comes the realisation everything is as it should be and there's no need to fear how this will all evolve.

There was plenty of incentive - it meant you couldn't copy the music from your device to another person (which meant you had to make lots more iTunes purchases kerching-a-ding-a-ling).  But obviously, Jobs et al realised that everyone would eventually ditch iTunes if they carried on down such a clearly draconian route, just as they will realise (eventually) that Bitcoin poses the exact same threat.  
And Apple not being able to provide a payment system to rival bitcoin isn't just an assumption, it's a fact.  Hell, don't you think the banks would have done it if they could?  Heck, both paypal and the bank of america were present in the bitcoin/CIA meet in 2011 and even back then they knew they couldn't beat bitcoin (because of its open source nature).  It's the same reason all mission critical apps (including the ISS) use Linux over any closed-source counterpart.
And of course, bitcoin isn't just about currency - [the blockchain tech changes everything...](

Humans naturally seek protection from danger.  In organised society that protection is afforded to us by governments and leaders who we believe to be better intellectually equipped to safeguard us from those dangers.  
"Laws control the lesser man... Right conduct controls the greater one." - Mark Twain
Laws exist to stop the biggest man simply taking what he wants through physical force and whilst, yes, monarchies have fallen and better forms of government have evolved in their stead, be under no illusion: we are still ruled by force, it's just more nuanced in contemporary society; the governments we elect exploit those same base instincts of fear and tribalism that governments centuries ago did, they still plunder other nations' wealth and resources, they still wage illegal wars, still lie, cheat and dupe the masses.
Indeed, those ruling classes at the top of the governmental, military, corporate pyramid act no differently than any bloodthirsty monarch or despot did centuries ago; they enjoy the same impunities from laws we have made (one rule for HSBC caught money laundering another rule for the mom n' pop small business owner, one rule for America invading a sovereign nation another rule for the rest of the world). 
This is all conducted under the tacit approval of an ill-educated, fearful populace, hyper adrenalised by a well-oiled machine that requires constant war and anxiety in order that it may continuously manipulate its subjects innate need to feel safe and protected.  
Then herd mentality sets in and all kinds of evils are committed in our name.  We know Hitler and the NSDAP were wrong, we know the Vietnam War was wrong, we know Iraq was wrong, we know dropping bombs won't solve the ISIS problem and we sure as shit know 1% of the population owning half of global wealth is wrong.  
That splinter in your mind that tells you something is very, very wrong in this world is there because, there is.   
The internet stands as our last beacon of hope.  It will be co-opted; the machine will try to silence those that dissent, as it tried with books and the printing press.  But the machine will fail because, for the first time in human history, the internet has meant knowledge and truth has become global with a zero access cost and a near-instant dissemination time. 
As history has shown time and time again, [truth always wins]( in the end.  
Humanity stands.

They're coming at D.A.C's from a community angle: how leaderless systems of consensus-based governance/decision making can occur within groups that have no hierarchical control structures.  
This is largely how the Occupy Movement (which Daniel was a big part of) organised its activities, i.e. via General Consensus.  Effectively, Occupy had no leaders (in the classic sense) and qualified as a D.A.C.
They're musing in the video on how this kind of system could be strengthened and streamlined with an online backbone, and have probably never heard of D.A.C.'s in the way we have.

Governments comprise of ordinary human beings, elected by other ordinary human beings to carry out the collective will of the people.
When disruptive technology, like the internet, comes along, usually it takes a small group of early innovators to lead the way, but if the masses see the potential in it, it's eventually adopted and accommodated for.  And that's when the entire world changes, and the unknown we once feared becomes the new 'normal'.

Just checked the video demo of this out and it's very impressive.
I think you will have some difficulty finding a market for this: as others have pointed out, the ubiquity of 3G / Free public Wi-Fi will make the prospect of finding target audiences willing to pay for this extremely narrow, not to mention the even denser niche of bitcoin users within that coterie.
Personally I would look into the following:
1. Build a web portal into the hotspot landing page that promotes bitcoin and related businesses in the area of the hostpot.
2. Offer free access to the internet and seek sponsors who are interested in front page advertising (coinbase et al spring to mind). 
3. You might consider speed/bandwidth rate limiting after a set period of time that can be upgraded to unlimited via a bitcoin payment and/or entry of a voucher code given at the PoS (if hotspot is in a retail outlet).  But I still think free is the way to go if you want to compete within the existing hotspot space.
4. Partner with a search engine such as duckduckgo and seek whitelabel branding so that you can direct users of the portal to your own search results (thus generating ad revenue on search clicks).
5. Approach businesses that already accept bitcoin (coffeeshops etc.) and split revenues from the portal.
6. Launch a home consumer version of the above that lets users share their internet connection and take a cut on revenues generated from the portal/search engine.

I don't think the ad should focus on the price either.  Bitcoin's strength is its utility, it shouldn't be promoted as a get-rich-quick scheme and, at this juncture, simply getting the word out and showing how beautiful it is to use, should be the key objective.
So I would argue for a basic, gentle primer and a simple call to action (go to bitcoin.org to find out more).  Something along the lines of: "Bitcoin is changing the way we think about money, the same way the internet changed the way we think about communication."

Agreed.  The first MMO that comes along that integrates bitcoin on such a level that it is intrinsic to the user experience will be massive.  Imagine something along the lines of the WoW auction house running on real 'virtual' money: an in-world economy based on the scarcity of objects and player skills in the game world.  
How many people would opt-out of the 'real world' rat-race to take part in such a fantasy if they could be rewarded monetarily IRL for their efforts?
The huge WoW user base gives us an insight into how many people *do* choose fantasy over reality but this may prove to be merely version 1 of the MMO experience.  When coupled with in-game economies that have real-world value the 'game' changes completely...It's no longer just a game.  
Couple this with VR (Occulus Rift etc.) and in a few decades we could see billions of people 'hooked-in' to these alternate realities.

3. I take Y to Bitstamp and cash out...
Unless bitstamp has some kind of arrangement with SealswithClubs there's no way of knowing what went on behind the scenes there and - even if they did - there's no way of proving account Y wasn't a legitimate user since SWC is anonymous.
And that's just ONE way of doing this.  Bitstamp can monitor all they want but anyone clever enough to make off with the funds in the first place is sure as hell clever enough to get them onto an exchange undetected.

I don't think the solution is in simply tacking BTC onto existing gameplay mechanics, rather it lies with inventing a whole new MMO user experience that is built with virtual currencies in mind.  We need not limit our thinking to what is only possible right now.  
Think of where Second Life might be in a decade or two for instance when coupled with VR.  Look at how far minecraft has come...  Fuse those two ideas together with bitcoin (a sandbox world where anything is possible that rewards you in real life) and we may well see a blurring between real-world and virtual.

I hate to be negative when I see people doing creative stuff but...I am not sure of the ethics in canvassing a community of enthusiasts for money to help market and promote a product.  Should we also be paying the Coinbase adwords fees under the spurious guise of spreading bitcoin awareness?
A TV commercial would be great but it should be product/service agnostic (like the protocol itself).  If some companies want to jump onboard and help with the fundraising of such an ad then, sure, some sponsor logos at the end could be subtly tied to the promotion...  
Whilst I wish them the best of luck, Pheeva seem to have this whole thing the wrong way round.  
As an aside, not sure an ad mentioning Silk Road and reiterating all the nonsense talked about bitcoin is especially effective at converting the uninitiated (or indeed the trolls themselves) regardless of the 'witty' punchline.  
I would envisage armchair discussions at half-time going something like this...
Dad: "I don't get it." (Already on the defensive)
Kid: "It's about bitcoin, this awesome new currency."
Dad: "What's Silk Road?"
Kid: "An online drugs marketplace that uses bitcoin exclusively, but that's not all bit..."
Dad: "Drugs are bad son, M'Kay..."
Far better, IMO, to focus on positives and use clear, ELI5 language (with a bold call to action) if your aim is to target the 99.9% of people who don't have a clue what bitcoin even is.  Heck, even the weusecoins 'what is bitcoin?' ad would work better.

At which point a pigeon snuck in through a crack in the door and pointed the Eagle in the direction of a world atlas.  The Eagle squawked in horror, realising for the first time, that the world is a rather big place.  Some brief discourse followed where the Pigeon explained to the entire class that there was a severe lack of empirical evidence in support of God, Jesus or the utility of any political party, regardless of stripe, and it was up to them to make up their own minds on the subject.
The class had just enough time to wonder what the hell this 'Pledge of Allegiance' was all about, pontificate over the Eagle's spelling of 'Saviour' and ask "Why is the American flag hanging in place of the Union Jack anyhow?" before 150 'precision-guided missiles' took out the dastardly pigeon along with the rest of the classroom 'collateral' (hitherto 'children'). 
The Eagle returned home to the land of the free and was met with trumpets and fireworks and chatshows, only to find he no longer had a home and was subsequently placed on paroxetine and sertraline to treat PTSD.

Tell that to the million Jews who were killed as a result of Hitler writing 'Mein Kampf'.  What came first the pictures of mass-graves and torture at concentration camps, or the words?
Tell that to those Muslims who issued a Fatwah against Salmon Rushdie for his words in 'The Satanic Verses'.
Or, how about the photos of Abu Ghraib prison torture released by Wikileaks: Men forced to lick each other's genitals whilst American marines laughed, jeered and tortured them.  Plenty of redneck Americans would find those photos hilarious but the average Muslim is going to find that at *least* if not magnitudes *more* offensive than any child porn.  But the point is, those pictures wouldn't exist had it not been for the words of George Bush et al.  
And yet I would still argue that the world is a better place for WikiLeaks releasing the pictures, if only as documentation and proof that these kind of evils have been committed.  How else can we address the root cause of the problem if it's been brushed under the carpet?
Same is true of Child exploitation - burying them in a darker closet won't stop people looking for those images.  The fact they exist in the first place is what needs to be addressed by society at large.
Language is the most powerful tool we have and what sets us apart from other primates.  We should not underestimate the untold damage words can cause when used in the wrong way.  And advocating censorship (of words or pictures) is no different to book burning.

Isn't the crux of the discussion here about verifying that a particular bitcoin address is tied to one person/entity?
One neat way of achieving would be to have various tiers of verification locked into a particular address:
1. Facebook / Twitter / LinkedIn / Email
2. Mobile Phone 
3. ID Scan/Facial Recognition
I realise this has already been done on several sites, but let's take it a step further and see how bitcoin fits in:
With each authentication tier, the wallet associated with your account gains more trust within the network and your vote / karma is positively weighted accordingly.  
What's more, if a particular ID is seen to be abusing the system, their vote / karma weights can be set to zero and/or the user associated with the ID banned from the given network/service;  this part is crucial, spamming and vote rigging becomes a one-time only deal if you are risking your own identity on not getting caught.
Various tweaks can be put in place at each tier level to further influence the weightings: Age of facebook account, number of twitter followers, wallet analysis etc. 
With regard to 3. AirBnB use Jumio to achieve ID validation and it's pretty damn cool - Hold your passport or licence up in front of your webcam and it's instantly authenticated.  Jumio also have a product called [Bitcoin Identity Open Network]( (which I've only just discovered). 
Anonymity can still be preserved within the system; personal details such as social media profiles, ID scan results can simply be stored as scrambled hashes; their purpose only to ensure no duplicate identities can be associated with any given bitcoin address, meaning a user never has to actually associate that information with any site or service.
Trust levels could be stored on the Blockchain, rather than a centralised service, with a simple one-off spend on the associated account that stores their tier level after verification is complete.  Karma levels associated with various sites on the network could also be stored and updated on the blockchain, albeit more infrequently.  Alternatively, these kind of identity association requests could, ultimately, be hardcoded into the protocol or handled by an online wallet provider such as blockchain.info as an extra service offering on top of their standard web wallet.  
We are left with one multi-use, transportable and unforgeable identity, locked to a bitcoin address that can be used for logging into various services (electoral voting, social network presence and all kinds of cool stuff that is currently impossible) whilst still preserving a persons anonymity.  And, perhaps crucially, an identity that the average layman can get to grips with for as long as they have an ID/mobile phone and/or online presence (basically, if they can use AirBnB to build trust, so too can they use this system).  
Only issues I can foresee:
*Trusting a third party like Jumio to ratify all of that information:* I see no reason why any 3rd party would need to know which bitcoin address is requesting ID validation (except as a scrambled hash that can be passed back to whatever open source service handles the callbacks).  
*Misuse/Hijacking of addresses:*  This could be solved with a 'cooling off' period whereby user weightings are frozen at zero for a set period of time if a particular service deems the address blacklisted.  Subsequent hijacks elicit longer periods.  Details of bans available on a trusted web service similar to ebay rankings that give banned users of a given service the right to protest / rebuttal.  Ultimately though, how blacklisted accounts are handled are completely up to the service provider (It doesn't matter if you've been a naughty boy on Reddit - you still get to participate in Electoral votes for instance).
*Service bias:* Sites and services themselves (such as Reddit, Youtube, Disqus, AirBnB) would be linked and ranked by the crowd in a similar way to users so that any specific services misusing the system (say blanket banning users) can be weeded out.

In order for bittorrent or indeed, the internet itself, to function as intended it is **mandatory** that people be free to seed whatever information they choose to.  
When Tim Berners-Lee first drafted the www specs CERN knew that it meant opening the world up to all kinds of information - good and bad.  Yet that didn't stop them going ahead with it - the pros far outweigh the cons.  As it is with bitcoin.    
As for your permanency fears: the 3D printed gun is now there forever on the bittorrent network, as are those pics of Jennifer Lawrence, leaked Snowden and Wikileaks documents and all kinds of illicit material.  Yet none of that is an argument for shutting down bittorrent or the internet, and never will be.

Gavin, this is like arguing html5 is not html. Bitcoin is whatever this grand project matures into via consensus. Satoshi's original vision has had to morph to deal with all kinds of unknown external pressures: Mt. Gox crash, Wikileaks pushing us above the radar too early, vitriol from mike hearn and your own attacks on core to name but a few of those pressures.
The latest core vs. unlimited debacle will also become a distant memory: one out-group trying to apply pressure on the beautiful gang that have already given 7 years of unbridled support and dedication to ensuring the most important thing: integrity. 
The bitter attacks (and I'm looking at Roger and his doxxing as much as Gavin and his insidious tweets) need to stop now. Either get with core and help them reach consensus or build your own coin with a new team - I hear the r3cev crew are looking for new jobs ;)

@_date: 2017-02-07 22:17:32
To extend this well thought out piece:
10/ The next phase will see all the crypto anarchists and original hackers that bought into this experiment from the beginning supporting the original core ethos and, if necessary core code will adapt to deal with the new unfolding landscape. 
11/ Those who are primarily invested in bitcoin for monetary rewards (i.e. big blockers) will see a huge backlash from those that bought into bitcoin for political reasons (i.e. the original crypto anarchists that built bitcoin).
Coders from core would no doubt infiltrate and perform sybil attacks on big blockers and generally make a nuisance of themselves, slowing down big blocker development to the point where only coders interested in the monetary incentive would derive any value in what would soon become a bitter and extremely high pressure working environment.  Big blockers would start losing clients, capitial and credibility at an exponential rate.
Meanwhile with Big blockers busy plugging holes in the sinking ships, Core would be left to develop real, practicable solutions without needing to divert energy currently being expended on meaningless argument and debate.  Massive infrastructure development in this new collaborative environment, including the maturation of various sidechain initiatives, would follow.  Indeed, we may even see Satoshi's original vision of having exchanges running through the client enacted, causing a crash of some of the existing models of those businesses/investors pushing so hard for big blocks.
12/ In parallel we could perhaps expect major hacks and boycotts on any exchanges and services that are seen as ROI focussed and/or in support of the 'big block business brigade' (similar to how GoDaddy saw a massive backlash when they came out in support of SOPA).  We'd see enterprising coders attacking the new protocol itself similar to what we saw happen with the DAO hack.  
Eventually mining pools that had bought into the big blocker rhetoric would break rank and revert to core.  The new fork - unable to sustain itself in a state of perpetual fear - would eventually go the way of R3CEV.
To Conclude/
Might happen that way, might not, might take one or two years for all of that to play out, or a few months.  Either way, we can be sure if one side is having to resort to using 'blackmagick' (paying for support, doxxing, buying ads, disseminating false information) then it's likely an apple that has a very bad core indeed (pun intended).  At the end of the day, big blockers - just like everyone who tried to fight this or shape this technology according to their own autocratic vision (Mike Hearn et al) - are damned if they do and damned if they don't.  
So, they may as well get onboard with the following groundbreaking idea: teamwork, collaboration, consensus and patient, rational debate are preferable to competitive 'dog eat dog' tactics.  Indeed, as we all unlearn the brain-damage inflicted upon us by the Geckoesque 'greed is good' mantra of the 80s, that applies to all areas of business if you want to ~~survive~~ thrive in this brave new era unfolding.

2. I spoof a bunch of requests that to all intents and purposes look legit. 
1. I amend a few SQL tables so that a bunch of customer balances are moved over to a new account.  I then move the coins out before anyone has realised what's happened.

At the moment Spotify pay around 1cent per play to artists, for $10 a month this translates to 66.7 hours of music per month or 2.7 days of constant listening.  According to Edison Research, the average American listens to 4 hours of music per day, so 16 days could be sustained under the current model.
However, bitcoin enables artists to completely cut out the middlemen and market direct to consumer; 70% of revenues currently go to record labels and distribution platforms.  Remove them from the equation, and unlimited listening could still be provided for $10 per month with the artists *still* getting a greater chunk of revenues than they do under the existing centralised models.
This doesn't even take into account extra micopayment channels that bitcoin opens up though video, merchandising and crowdfunding platforms that allow artists to market directly to their fanbase (See [Amanda Palmer TED talk]( on raising $1.3m through Kickstarter for her album release).

IIRC the wonderful James D'Angelo cracked decentralised identity via bitcoin (1000x more effective than a passport) around a year back and has been presenting his solution to the UN this year.  
Sir Tim Berners Lee also tweeted his [BlockStack ID]( mid 2016.  
I'd be surprised too, if AirBnB haven't figured something glorious out with the ChangeTip team given they already have a rock-solid legacy ID verification system in place via their relationship with [Jumio](  Bitcoin ATM's also have fingerprint / ID scanning solutions in place.
Conflate all those things, and I would hazard a guess everyone is waiting for this scaling nonsense to be over before coming out of stealth with a tsunami of innovation that will once and for all solve the problem of decentralised global identity.  
Then things get crazy: we have rock solid decentralised ID, unstealable wallets and funds, but also rock solid KYC requirements if those Global ID's are required at exchanges (and virtually everywhere else you want to interface in a cashless reality).  The whole thing only works if literally *everything* is decentralised...  Pandora's Box has been opened and inside we find... another Pandora's Box...

Yeah this has to change.  Right now we're basically seeing a company producing ASICs also running a massive Pool and bitcoin.com running their own pool and paying 110% the normal reward, basically bribing miners to side with BU.  Which isn't that far removed from the very problem bitcoin was trying to fix - i.e. commercial banks creating money out of thin air.  None of it matters too much, since Core have so many freakin' backup plans.  But it is a frustrating bump along the lunar launchpad.
The mining industry will surely evolve to the point where commercial users have mining chips embedded in everything from lightbulbs to smartphones and toasters.  
I know bitfury have a working lightbulb mining chip implementation, 21inc also doing interesting things and I imagine the first smartphone manufacturer to figure out a clean way of doing this and integrating cold wallet storage is going to be heading to the moon.

This whole journey from the moment Satoshi opened Pandora's box has been about backup plans.  I consider BU a 'dry run' as should Daniel.  It does not require force of will, or to use the Microsoft brand as a battering ram, it requires only calm and rational dialogue.  That’s the only way we got this far, thanks to the likes of Andreas Antonopolous appealing to the rationality of senators and financial incumbents.
If Microsoft see Bitcoin and Global ID as just another ‘Microsoft service' that needs to get to market and their billion users as nothing more than cogs in another money engine – exploitable as they were during the browser wars you mentioned – then not only is that an insult to their users as citizens, but it really tells me that Microsoft don’t yet understand where this technology is heading... and the plethora of ontological issues that bitcoin, blockchain and decentralisation opens up.
It’s early days for us all and we’re all still learning… but I’m confident, as ever, we’ll all get there together.  And I’m glad Microsoft and Daniel are on our side, but for now reserve judgement on what colour hats they are wearing ;)
Should the day come when it is the billion user Microsoft fork we will be resisting, I’m sure Roger will be welcomed back into the fold to deploy all his FUD cunning to help freedom prevail :p  Failing that, there’s always the Satoshi 10% red button.  
I hope in future Daniel comes to understand his own 'red button' is every bit as dangerous and, whilst BU is a worry, it's not such a threat it requires going to [DEFCON 1](
Peace.

Sounds good, on the proviso this 'user-protecting' default can't be unoptionally changed at the sole-discretion of whatever tech emperor with no clothes happens to be 'chief of blockchain' at the time (no matter how well informed he or she thinks they may be).  


Which is to say, if there's a breakdown of consensus in core, under a normal hardfork scenario, it's incumbent on Microsoft to remain *completely* impartial as to where its tech points the world's citizens (and all their personal data) by *default*.
If that makes you or the brand you are playing with uncomfortable at this stage, then there's a perfectly good centralised playing ground over at Ethereum bitcoiners funded for you whilst we iron out the last few kinks over here.  Or follow Google and all the other tech 'giants' (and indeed governments) lead and wait and see how this nascent technology develops before rushing into something that may well blow up in your face.  
ProTip: People who truly grok Ƀitcoin (and where it's headed) rarely use price as a timestamp for when they first 'bought in'; preferring instead, to cite the reference client number.  Or, in some very extreme cases, whatever particular [warzone]( being run by emperors with no clothes Ƀitcoin [saved them from]( at the time.
Genuinely: thanks for your work with Firefox, let's hope your experience there means you think very carefully about how the future is going to unfold so that history doesn't repeat itself.  I admire your chutzpah and trust you and Microsoft will eventually find sound footing in this space.  In the meantime, as you can see from the front page, Team Ƀ has got this ;)

All I hear in this interview is a man obsessed with money and price, someone who completely misses the reason bitcoin was invented in the first place.  If all we wanted was a bigger, faster incarnation of all the greed enshrined in that old world, then we wouldn't have struggled so hard for the last 7 years to get to here.
**Which side would Satoshi be on?**
Roger is constantly presuming what 'Satoshi' would have wanted.  Well, he/she/they have approximately 10% of all bitcoins in existence and not a single one of them has moved to date.  That's how much Satoshi cared about money and price.
Indeed, he/she/they may well have envisaged a hard fork like this coming one day, and see those holdings as Operation: Last Resort...  Those coins moving may well end up being Satoshi's 'last vote' to secure the integrity of the original idea.

The reason a hard fork exists as a possibility *is* to preserve the very decentralisation you are clamouring for.  BU is the third 'attack' on core (XT/Classic driven by Mike/Gavin being the other two).  It is not for Microsoft to push their users onto one side or the other through force.  If you do, you will receive the same kind of backlash Jihan Wu at Bitmain is experiencing right now from the Bitcoin community at large. 
Microsoft would, however, be expected to weigh in on the debate and curate sound arguments for the blockchain tech industry (and wider public) to contribute to.   Thus helping the decentralised network *as a whole* decide the best route to take and the optimal solution - *even if* that goes against what the tech majority (in Microsoft or otherwise) are against.  The only way to make all this work is to consent to this wisdom of crowds and start work on building and driving much, much better consensus and discussion platforms that involve the entire community, and reward those impartial contributors best able to filter out noise and uncertainty.
It's important to understand that whilst techies are well versed in the algorithmic method and sound, logical reasoning, they are not necessarily experts in the *very real* ontological issues that make this world spin.
**Learning from recent events and evolving this space**
Techies and entrepreneurs alike are all rightly excited by this tech and we all want to push on and 'break things' but a certain restraint is needed if we are to avoid putting the ecosystem into a perpetual state of fight of flight.  In part, bitcoiners have been constantly in this state given the massive disruption this space has caused to incumbents over the last 8 years.  
We got here by being bloody [paranoid]( of everyone's motives and that kind of culture isn't set to change soon, especially when there are [so many people]( thinking this has to be a zero sum game.
In truth, whilst I trust the majority of the old-timers I grew up with building the internet who are the driving force behind most of this, even they have made questionable decisions.  For as long as the secrecy of board meetings (and commercial deals remain an incentive) none of us can say for sure what Blockstream, R3Cev or any other seemingly benign entity (remember the Bitcoin Foundation? ;0) may end up accidentally screwing up.  Which is why we can *never* be certain what option is best to 'protect' users, except the option of truth: no-one is or can be in charge.
What I *can* say about those old-timers, however, is that given we've been [thinking and dreaming very deeply about this tech]( for nigh on 20 years, they above anyone will exercise patience to a fault.  Failure is no longer an option, even if it takes another 3 years (which sounds excruciating to well meaning actors like Roger who wants to start seeing bitcoin coffee purchases enter the mainstream tomorrow).
Really this blocksize debate should have been fixed a few years ago.  Many of us in bitcoin have been wearing so many hats (PR, Coding, Essaying, Ramen procurement :p) it's been very difficult to balance everything for such a small group of misfits.  But the biggest problem has been facing the ongoing onslaught of FUD and people who have good intentions and are excited by bitcoin but are easily swayed by poorly understood information (and that goes for people at the very 'top' as much as it does new adopters).
**Moving toward the obvious solution**
Clearly we need to create a new open source platform outside of the twitter / reddit echo chamber that allows citizens to login with their Global ID, take a series of blockchain and critical thinking awareness tests and establish a 'web of trust' that begins to plot out individuals and their links to other people within their sphere of influence.  Reddit Karma style systems would aid rational discussion and I'd even go so far as allowing contentious discussions to run in 'anonymous' mode so that ideas and direction cannot by swayed by powerful personalities or the loudest voice.  
We would need experts in all fields (not just techies) to be able to create a diverse ecosystem able to meet the many challenges decentralised governance is going to face in this brave new future.
I'd see a Khan Academy style points system feeding back into Reddit, Facebook, Google+ to establish further trust and begin to plot out links within their sphere of influence...For example, users in r/bitcoin would be able to display 'flair' based on their participation in the above system enabling ordinary reddit citizens to begin to filter out 90% of the noise and 'paid shills'.
I'd also like to see skills, knowledge and bios next to users in this web of trust (perhaps beginning by social media data migration as well as testing and certification results both from the platform itself and programs like Khan Academy).  All of this is possible when social media and indeed *all* online platforms are using the same immutable Global ID login.  Schools and universities would also be natural partners here.
I would envisage this as a precursor to a consensus / global trust rank system that could be used in everything from global political platforms right down to local governance, voting platforms and even crowd-driven funding for new projects and businesses.  Naturally, your global ID is going to be needed for this to really start gaining momentum.
Given that the most searched for thing on Google post-Brexit was "what is the EU", this kind of craziness simply **couldn't have happened** had you needed at least *some* basic *objective* knowledge and critical thinking pass mark to register your referendum vote.  Same with blockchain discussions under this knowledge-led regime.
Only then will we be able to start bridging the 'intellectual gap' that has seen 'right' against 'left' nearly tear themselves apart in recent times, leaving so many citizens of this world feeling absolutely powerless at the endless barrage of 'post-factual' noise levied at them by those with specious interests.
The UK government and [Bank of England]( have coined the term 'glass governance', which I rather like.  I see this as crowd-driven glass governance, and it seems natural to start with governance of the bitcoin blockchain protocol itself ;)
For now, whilst we are reliant on a somewhat opaque trusted 'inner-circle' the threat of a hard fork must always loom in the background.
But with the above systems baking in all kinds of checks and balances, the need to initiate drastic measures through technical brute force is reduced to virtually null since the ecosystem itself will find the optimal solution.  In that scenario, Microsoft becomes a trusted voice able to influence the project path, but a voice that is no louder than anyone else who has established ecosystem trust.

This cuts to the very core (pun unintended) to why we have struggled so very hard these last 8 years to ensure no benevolent dictators get to shape this project.  Daniel B, whilst I'm sure means well has missed the point of why that struggle has been so long and hard and, crucially, why it can take no shortcuts or dirty hacks...
Daniel forcing his political viewpoint on a billion unwitting participants is no different to the nefarious practices of Roger et al (e.g. forcing their subjective 'truths' on unwary users through advertising and the near 'hijacking' of the bitcoin name through his bitcoin.com purchase).
Daniel cites himself as a voluntaryist (as does Roger).  As I understand it, a core tenet of Voluntaryists is that no goal should be achieved through force or coercion over the individual.  Put Simply: What is or isn't *safe* or *right* for those users is down for each individual to decide for *themselves* after being presented with well rounded, unbiased arguments designed to shed light on **both** sides of the debate.
Forcing them to go one way via a *uni-lateral 'invisible hand' of 'benevolence'* leads down a slippery slope to that age-old problem of absolute power corrupting, and is no different to the strategy adopted by Jihan.
That is not decentralisation.

Haven't heard from him since the UN announcement and can't find the YT videos he did about this...  But basically, you can walk anywhere without even needing a phone and access services via facial recognition (which humans are very good at) linked to a public bitcoin blockchain record.
You elect to give permission to various actors to decrypt different levels of record access which can comprise multiple 'things' (photo albums, soundbites, DNA, medical records, whatever).  
Essentially this means you can walk into a shop, airport, high security office naked without phone or wallet and still prove identity and pay for goods and services.  Lots of intricacies I'm missing out but you get the picture...
Couple this with [Amazon Go]( style shopping stores and AI-led facial recognition and today's world of security guards, ticket barriers and checkout clerks starts to look like the middle ages ;)

What is or isn't *safe* or *right* for those users is down for each individual to decide (which I imagine is a key tenet of the voluntaryism 'bible').
By all means present those users with a 'critical alert' and well rounded, unbiased arguments based on objective reality designed to shed light on **both** sides of the debate.  And by all means make it simple for users to then pledge preference to one technical solution over the other...
But force them to go one way via a uni-lateral 'invisible hand' of 'benevolence'?  Well, that leads down a slippery slope to that age-old problem of absolute power corrupting, and is no different to the strategy adopted by Jihan.

This is the tweet I am referring to: [
Where Daniel B mentions actively blocking BU.
To be very clear on this issue: BU is a sideshow, but the next one may not be... Any change to a system that will affect the lives of a billion or more people cannot be made solely at the behest of one 'chief' no matter how well intentioned. So, just as you are given a choice whether to make a critical update on your OS (and the various patches explained in depth), so should you be given a choice on any 'patches' that will affect the entire global monetary and identification system. And, never, ever should those billion people using your product be used as leverage, or your ability to affect them with a code change be used to make threats against your opponent.
And that's right, that means even my 71 year old Mother who was coding computers with me back in the 80's and is still tinkering away on her PC and Smartphone, and yes, even those Old Grandpas that cracked the Enigma code at Bletchley Park, get to decide what version of Bitcoin they want to run on their machine if they are interested in the ramifications of the update.

Again.  You're conflating an unsafe reference client push (which is technical) with a hard fork scenario (which is idealogical).  I know you mean well Daniel, but until you can grok those two distinctions and why the latter scenario is so rare, then in my view you are not fit to be in charge of the codebase of a billion users of this technology.  
Indeed, should your 'Microsoft Blockchain Passport' gain user traction, the internal politics of Microsoft will one day pose just as significant a threat to the network as BU does currently. That is, just enough to be annoying, but not enough to truly stand in the way of where those invested in bitcoin - the idea, are headed.
To be clear: A hard fork scenario can be viewed as a healthy thing for bitcoin and any open source project that has reached an impasse that blocks progress.  It doesn't mean bitcoin needs heads of division in for-profit corporations stepping in as 'protectors of the coin' with the equivalent of a LOIC.  It means big problems need to be solved, rationally and through consensus.

That is certainly a strong argument for going with Core and one of the main reasons I support Core.  But loathed if I will force others to do the same.  Instead, I will remain confident that the ecosystem (that begins with core and ends with the users of their code) will make the right choice, precisely because there are no benevolent dictators in core using black magick to force those users how to think or what code to run.  As we are seeing... Ultimately: truth, passion, belief and self determinism will be what prevails.

IMO, you're thinking too much in the status quo.  Let's imagine in 3 years time we have one Global Pass for everything, running through the blockchain.  Your money, house, medical records, drivers id, visas, everything on one immutable, impossible to counterfeit Decentralised Global ID that relies on protocol level code not dissimilar to the http protocol.  
By then of course there will be bitcoin blockchain mining chips and nodes running in everything from smartphones, toasters, and radiators to pc's and supercomputers so there will be none of this BU nonsense... However, the protocol will still want to be changed from time to time just as W3C upgrades internet protocols from time to time via a series of workgroups that require consensus.  So that's all great, 'decentralised systems experts' work out the various changes via a series of BIP's and the code moves on and upgrades without major concerns or controversy (as we've seen happen countless times from the first reference client right the way up to 0.14).  
Now, let's say one day there is a proposal that has split consensus (like the BU / Core proposal).  By now the entire planet is as reliant on their Global Pass as they are today their email, bank account and passport.  Do you think that one 'chief' of decentralised security should get to decide what happens, or do you think everyone whose destiny is going to be affected by the change should get a right to decide for themselves if they have an idealogical position one way or another?  BU is what we programmers call a 'dry run'.  But what happens in the future if all our records on the blockchain?  Suppose one of those future forks means no Americans will be granted Visas issued on the forked chain for political reasons a large portion of the world supports...  Whilst that scenario may sound ridiculous, not too long ago the idea that a President might propose banning migrants from 6 muslim countries would also sound ridiculous.  
Question is, when Blockchain is Law and Law is Blockchain, do you want Daniel in Microsoft deciding what happens?  Or should we all get a say in the matter?
This discussion goes to the very bedrock of democracy itself.  By your reasoning, 'ordinary' people shouldn't be able to vote Democrat or Republican, since they are not experts on homeland security, finance, technology etc.  And yet, the entire purpose of democracy is to allow non-governmental experts (i.e. ordinary citizens) to be informed if they so choose to be (and in doing so exercise their right to vote and guide policy).
You see the arguments in Core Vs. BU aren't terribly difficult to understand if you so choose to take the time.  Many do not and will choose instead to let their vote be informed by a trusted 'expert' like Andreas, who has explained the ramifications in simple terms and has proven his integrity over many years.  The crux of all this though, is that you **DO** get to vote and have a voice.  What Daniel is suggesting is the equivalent of sending a nuke (or performing a botnet attack with a billion PC's) without giving anyone the ability to choose to be informed on whether they consent to being a part of the attack.

The option that results in more robust decentralisation is the option that remains vulnerable to a fork if there's a split in idealogy / philosophy.  By all means Microsoft, Google and others will get to state their position, just as Google / Wikipedia / Reddit got to voice their opinion (and influence the senate) over SOPA, but brute force a democratic vote via their userbase?  Nawww.  That's not Bitcoin.  That's E-Coin.

Haha.  Well the modern business world, obsessed with increasing imaginary numbers, is a breeding ground of tired and unamiganative ideas that simply repackage something someone else is already doing and think throwing a slightly different logo into the mix and bombarding people with adversing double speak, constitutes success.  Do we really need 100s of exchanges, 'revolutionary' banking apps?  Or have people just run out of ideas?
If you asked 90% of businesses what they're doing to truly make the world a better place, in the end most would only be able to say "creating jobs".
Fortunately, I think citizens are beginning to want more out of life than the endless 9-5 grind that ends in the shopping mall.  As automation kicks in and we wake up to the realisation that job creation and GDP growth is meaningless if everyone hates the world those metrics have lead to... the next generation of businesses really are gonna need to answer that "why?" effectively if they want the patronage of younger generations yearning to find a more meaningful existence.
Advertising will likely be the first industry to be upended by all this as councils and citizens take back ownership of their precincts and vote these companies out unless they are offering something deemed truly beneficial to the local populace that is devoid of marketing gimmicks and dark magic.

For instance, I'm cool with medics getting decryption keys to important life-saving medical data attached to my encrypted global identity record, not cool with them handing that out to third parties offering it up to medical insurance companies. 
I'm cool with visa provisioning services determining length of stay in a country based on my employment records and the karma / social capital scores I've accrued in life and online, not cool with facebook using that info to target ads at me.
I'm good with Google using my location data and the photos i've taken to build up an online diary of where I've been, not cool with some terms and conditions that say they can sell that info to some 'big data' company (even it has been anonymized) for a price...

What is incredible about all this is how  youngsters that have found this old wisdom (that was once only available in esoteric circles) and remixed it into a more accessible form for the whole of humanity (with the exception of the 3 billion without internet). 
Which has made it much easier for old people like me to digest the information in new ways; especially beautiful are the addition of new visuals and audio and crunching it all into bitesize nuggests of info.  Young YouTuber TJOP is a good example.  As are Jason Silva's 'shots of awe' which are even more intense bursts of information lighting up new neural pathways and idea spaces.
Alan Watts - What is the Secret of Life? (from The Journey of Purpose)
Jason Silva - New Definition of Billionnaire 
TED and TEDx talks another great example about how contemporary 'gurus' can now convey their ideas across a global audience; again removing barriers of class, race, status. 
Of course, as Alan would attest "my gurus are no better than your gurus."  It's for all of us to find our own way and learn from the giants whose shoulder's we stand on.

I appreciate your concerns but would say this:
For those actually interested in Bitcoin - the technology, there's plenty of good information out there to be found, both in this sub, on youtube and the myriad articles, journals and technical papers out there.  
The problems you cite are not endemic to r/bitcoin itself; they are an internet-wide issue.  It's the same problem Paul Graham faces with hacker news, same dilema twitter and facebook are wrestling with when echo chambers of misinformation various internet subcultures have spawned railroad discussions and groups.
The internet as it stands is broken.  We have created a global village that long ago breached Dunbar's number and the aging tools we built to preserve the flows of information integrity.  Truth is, there are very few people in the world that understand the problems, let alone understand how to deploy tech like Blockstack to solve those problems.  It's a mammoth re-engineering project and it (like bitcoin) will take time.
Luckily for us, the future of bitcoin (and the internet) is not contingent upon reddit subs.  Indeed, the 4 billion people it can most help on this planet have likely never even heard of reddit.  For those that have, well the onus is really on them to wade through the noise (as it is with every other subject they have a keen interest in) to sort out fact from fiction, whilst we work out how to reduce the signal/noise ratio across the entire net.
If you are keen on understanding this more (and why it has happened), I highly recommend the excellent documentary ['HyperNormalisation']( by Adam Curtis.

It has potential because the paper lays down facts about what the system can and will do (not opinons).  The paper is not a glossy advertisement, it's science.

As Einstein once said: “The most important decision we make is whether we believe we live in a friendly or hostile universe.”  It is worth noting that in 1952, Einstein turned down the position of President of Israel.
Be under no allusions here.  McCafee ran for President of USA in 2016...  His words (and actions) suggest he and his cohorts are as much about power and control as those he seeks to oppose.  Adopting such a stance means you rarely get to break bread with those who actually hold *real* influence in this world, i.e. those people who have been holding things together day in day out for decades whilst we all try to figure the optimal way forward as a species.
Maintaining an adversarial stance means you become increasingly ignorant to the wider world (and the unfolding future) since you have such little access to those shaping it (and the information they will convey).  Indeed, the old adage "it's not what you know but who you know" rings true throughout all ages.  The less open you are to those on the 'other side' of the fence the less diversity of information you are able to take onboard, and the more you become entrenched in an increasingly myopic vision of the world and confused when events don't go your way.  
Bitcoin - by design - is diametrically opposed to any vision that requires a coterie of individuals wielding 'power', no matter how well intended those individuals may perceive themselves to be.  
The more friendly humans are, the more trust and information we are willing to share with each other.  Therein lies the only true 'power' and the only real 'currency' of value in this world.  Personally I find life, and the world, makes far more sense when we let go of the need to control it; in doing so, we invariably find ourselves surrounded by those who fervently believe we live in a friendly universe.  From this comes an energy borne of optimism and belief in a better future for all, which is infinitely more powerful than entropic energy rooted in fear, control and Machiavellian impulse.
As MLK observed: the moral arc of the universe always bends towards justice.  This is because, in the end, the stewardship of spaceship Earth is always passed onto those who have been entrusted with the greatest access to information and, with that access, the truth.

Sure, dependent upon how the code evolves to define that security model...  If we're talking longterm (and Daniel is), then a proof of work change backed by users requires relatively little (coding) effort and completely rewrites the rules of the game.  It is the Operation: Last Resort core will always have up their sleeves if necessary.  
In such a scenario where ASIC mining cartels have zero influence, we would then be looking to see which chain develops the best user features over time...  And it will of course be the chain that has the best coders, the best ideas and greatest user and internet/tech industry trust and support (including support of incumbents like Microsoft).  Not to mention the change that has the widest global reach (hence the satellites being an incredible leap forward for organisations like the UN and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation who have been pushing bitcoin in awareness in places like Kenya).
I don't see *any* major innovations like LN / Blockstream Satellite / Blockstack coming out of the other stable, only rehashing of tired old business models like Shapeshift that do nothing but place more middleware between users and chain services to enrich a small coterie of bitcoin business elites who run those centralised services.

99.9% of people on this planet are basically decent human beings stuck in a broken, rigged system that erroneously assumes everyone is selfish and out for themselves...  These bureaucratic antiquated protectionist systems that label everyone wishing to participate a 'bad guy' until they prove otherwise, leads to a percentage of those good people living in fear due to all the mistakes and basic rights people are denied along the way, whilst actual 'bad guys' figure out how to step around it all anyhow.  Rather than using a carrot to incentivise good behaviour we constantly threaten the stick to de-incentivise bad behaviour.  It's all backwards.
Cut the read tape and the inspectors doing jobs to inspect inspectors and, for the most part, those doing stuff in the shadows will stick out like a sore thumb.  
As for how all this is related to bitcoin unfolding: it's likely by the time the old world has caught up with all this most of the people inheriting and making use of this technology (Millennial's and Gen-Z) have been so used to living their lives out in the open on the web (e.g. facebook) the entire concept that people used to live in secrecy and give away their entire lives (spending habits, identity) to complete strangers tasked with 'protecting them for their own good' will be alien to most.  
Meanwhile, there's a good portion of the politicians now debating these bills who have themselves invested in bitcoin and other crypto because they too have realised fractional reserve banking is an illusion... so there's now incentive for a good bunch of politicians working in the light to actually ensure this tech thrives so they can be deployed to upgrade those old systems.

As Einstein observed "the most important decision we make is whether we live in a friendly or hostile universe".  Having travelled to over 60 countries my main take away is that everyone is the same once you strip away preconceived tribal differences.  I mean we all descended from one human (mitochondrial Eve).  Go back far enough and that is literally true.  
We just lost our way a little I feel, but we'll get there, we always do (as everything from civil rights to bitcoin is showing, the status quo never lasts long.

Andreas' brilliant sewer rats analogy I would go further with:
A while back, experiments with mice confirmed there was a gene that governed our intelligence and ability to learn ([see Dr. Robert Sapolsky discussing here](  
Whilst this got much MSM press coverage at the time ("Hey you might be stupid because you inherited it, stupid!") what got far less press attention is that in the same experiments scientists found if they took the 'stupid' mice out of the drab environment they were bought up in and placed them in a rich environment with lots of stimuli they quickly overcame the genetic disadvantage.  Which tells us that intelligence is all about environment.
And that's really the story with modern day humans who grew up on the internet - an environment rich in culture and stimuli that allowed kids to overcome environmental and cultural constraints placed upon them by a system of wealth inequality that, prior to the internet, saw most 'proles' at a disadvantage.  
Everything changed with the internet - no longer did 'ordinary' children born in poor environments have to rely on the limited knowledge of their parents and substandard schooling, since the internet now gave them equal access to information and data that prior to this was normally only accessible to a privileged few (think JSTOR only being available to rich college kids for example).  
So the sewer rats began to quietly evolve into super rats, to the point where denizens of the net invented their own [dictionary]( and took command of the very thing that holds everything together - language and art.  Indeed, to old world 'leaders' who used to decide what got added to the Oxford English dictionary for instance, acronyms like FOMO, LOL, TIL are as alien to them as their esoteric latin was to the proles.  No longer did old world newspapers and tv stations get to control the cultural output of the masses.  
And then there's the language of computer code that these super rats have taken command of to rebuild this world anew; a language and secret code that positively looks like witchcraft to most who grew up in the old world.
Of course, the shit really hit the fan when these super rats began to think about the old world language of money and just what exactly Henry T. Ford meant when he said "if the average person knew how the banking industry worked, there'd be revolution before breakfast" to which, after much witchcraft and wizardry, the super rats announced to the old world with great enthusiasm - **[FTFY!]( ;)

He is talking about vanilla segwit (non-2x).  i.e. don't get confused by the 2MB+ reference, he's discussing what *effectively* segwit increases blocksize to through code improvements.
In that respect, 2X is neither ready, nor does it have replay protection in place (so can in no way can be deemed safe for the overall integrity of the ecosystem).

Yeah the information flow and noise is likely directly correlated to the amount of irrational fear many of those not versed in computer science / engineering have during times when protocol coding / maintenance is at its highest (generally when there's a perceived 'crisis'.
I'd hypothesize it being correlated due to the actual people working behind the scenes being away from reddit and doing *actual* work as opposed to moderation and commentary.
Therefore those most able to quell people's irrational fears / erroneous comments, aren't actually around, creating a catch-22' the noise reaches a crescendo until the code and work is done at which point the irrational panic is over.  Perhaps?
Would be very interesting to run an experiment with github / dev group activity vs. reddit FUD (sentiment analysis cross-referenced with Google trends / reddit user count) should give us some worthwhile datasets to build a model on this... Results should be able to conclusively prove or disprove the above hypothesis, though nothing to worry about in the long run; as more and more people get clued up on all this, the FUD / confusion will depreciate if historical records are anything to go by.

Is Coinivore.com a credible source?  Given the typos, this suggests a lack of thorough editorial oversight, so be wary of anything you read there until cross-checked with other more credible sources; they may be concerned more with advertising clicks and 'scoops' than doing cross-reference checks of multiple sources themselves to verify fact from fiction (my apologies to Coinivore if it was just an honest mistake).
Not that it really matters much what the press are saying at this juncture; seems to me this reddit and bitcointalk is where you will most likely get closest to the primary sources on the cool stuff going on, which will then inform press and all key influencers outside of bitcoin.
By the time journalists get there it's been subjected to so much noise along the way, the truth is often lost and reddit / bitcointalk have already moved onto the next thing.

Can we name any absolutes though?
Given we don't even know what 'reality' is it seems what we think is certain is actually in constant flux, much like how we observe the behaviour of atoms in the quantum world.  Bear in mind there was a time when scientists declared "yay! High five everyone, we've worked everything out an know everything we're ever going to need to know about the universe" and the 'head' of IBM told humanity the world would need no more than 5 computers.  That was an absolute in his eyes, and yet, as the future rolled forward it was proven to be wrong.
For instance, for those that have read Nick Bostrom's simulation argument, reality starts looking very weird indeed.
See: 
If it is shown to be true that we are indeed living in a simulation then ill conceived inter-subjective notions like "time is linear" and even death itself are no longer absolutes; in a simulation we could see it's architects bring simulants out to a new layer of 'reality'...  Sounds crazy, but so does Bacteria in a world without microscopes, as does the idea of heavier than air objects flying to an establishment that thought this would go against all absolute observed truths of the time.  
Key is to question everything you think you know and understand it could be wrong; then start thinking for yourself and enjoying the gift of life by looking to your immediate environment and see how it can best be shaped in a positive image of the future.  
There is a reason that Einstein said "The most important decision we make is whether to believe we live in a friendly or hostile universe."
Indeed, recent scientific studies show that the universe moving towards entropy may be yet another absolute that is absolutely wrong.  Question is then, is it all a matter of collective belief in the end?  Does seem to me that we humans can do anything we put our mind to as long as we're willing to let go of the need to control.
"The ball is round, the game lasts 90 minutes, everything else is pure theory.  Off we go!" - [Sepp Herberger](
You may be keen to read Isaac Asmiov's short story "The Last Question", which was his favourite piece of work. 
See: 
It basically predicts the internet almost exactly 40 years before it came into being, and he then goes onto to describe what comes next in this great journey.  The running theme through it all is "can we reverse entropy?"  The final answer is quite stunning in its beautiful simplicity.
:)  
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:21:37
There's the thing, how can you have an opposing argument when we live in an inter-subjective reality that is based on probabilities and not absolutes?  Why not simply discuss what we *think* we know and let objective reality and the wisdom of well informed crowds weigh up the evidence for each of the possible 'truths'.
Science has gotten us this far because it is willing to be wrong and accepts that nothing is certain.  In fact it's happy to be wrong in the face of extraordinary evidence (but still accepts that even in light of new evidence assumed truths can still be wrong).  Newton's equations being slightly out is a good example (but they were enough to get us off the planet until later perfected).
Of course, there was a time when all the 'great' scientists and 'experts' declared "We have discovered everything we need to know about the universe!"  
This is the epitome of hubris. 
So... Just as we cannot say there is a God with absolute certainty we also can't say there is not a God for the same reason.  Simple Boolean logic here applied to societal cognitive constructs.
When we figure this out, we can make a firm commitment to "never ever lie".  When we do that, our neurons will re-shift and, instead of having to remember an invented false reality, we begin to divert all our brain power to existing in *actual* reality rather than a semi-real invention.
In poetry, this was expressed by the great [T.E. Lawrence]( ("Laurence of Arabia") who wrote:
"All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible. This I did."
Or, in simpler terms: "To travel is to realise everybody is wrong about other people." — [Aldous Huxley]( (author of Brave New World).
I daresay this could be further revised to read: "To travel is to realise everybody is right AND wrong about other people."
Aldous was talking about physical traveling but of course books, and now the internet, skype, messenger, reddit allow us to leap vast geographical distances at virtually lightspeed, which allows us to take the same vast leaps in consciousness as Aldous and T.E. Lawrence took in the old world.
The only sensible thing then, is to be open to both possibilities and push those emotional knee-jerk responses we all have a tendency to revert to (when cognitive dissonance threatens our world view) to where they belong: that primitive ape brain that helped defend us off from predators. 
So there you go, my natural conclusion to all this is: I'm happy for you to be right and wrong in your assertion; my worldview is not threatened by whatever belief structure you feel the need to ascribe to.  
Note, a debate could be expressed programmatically (using say, PHP) thusly:
10. $one_side_right = true;
20. WHILE ($one_side_right == true)
30. {
40.  echo "WE ARE RIGHT!";
50. }  
60. echo "The only winning move is to not play the game...
";
70. playNiceGameOfChess();
(Note this creates an infinite echo "WE ARE RIGHT!" loop, and we never get to play a nice game of chess) :D

Yeah absolutely.  The BitWage API is incredible in this respect and already fulfills nearly all of those admin use cases (and massively reduces the costs and overheads that come with them).  I think you can even integrate directly into SAGE so no manual entry required from staff.  Remember EY / Deloitte have been accepting bitcoin for their accounts too so we have two of the biggest accounting firms in the world with a keen interest in streamlining all this and seeing BTC thrive.
Also worth mentioning Stripe already integrated bitcoin ages ago, so there's potential there for BitWage and Stripe to talk directly to each other when shoppers make purchases.

Lots of people write code.  I find the most interesting and beautiful code often comes from those rare programmers that can do both design and coding.  So, whilst cypherpunks (as a general rule) are great at the more analytical and technical side, when it comes to UX and creating things people can actually use, not so much.
Whilst we certainly need the knowledgable rocket scientists ensuring that all the numbers have been crunched to the point there can be no launch failure, just as important are the designers, coders and engineers who are able to think through actual real world needs of people using the rocket... Else it's just a rocket reserved for an elite privileged few with esoteric knowledge.  Moving it along to the next stage is an entirely different art form.
Phase 2 requires ensuring we get to a place where space tourists can comfortably sit down at the control panel of the rocket without accidentally pressing the eject button and Phase 3 would see us working on the interior so that people enjoy the experience of using the craft, all with the user having close to zero prior navigational knowledge.
To build that requires taking what the cypherpunks did and passing it over to imagineers.  But the thing is cyclical, if it's evolving; with no particular 'group' of creators more or less valuable to the overall success of the project.
"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution." — Einstein

There can be no 'seizing of control'...  Garzik, who has been so divisive in all this, just lost access to the Git repo.  
That *is* the bitcoin code resisting control and ensuring that those who want to bruteforce consensus are politely asked to 'go their own way'.  Which Garzik is perfectly entitled to do given this is an open source project.
Try to temper the fear you have of people and corporations in this space.  It's like worrying that Redhat or Ubuntu are gonna' destroy linux.
Remember that Gavin and Mike got kicked out for trying similar 'my way or the high way' stunts.  
Ultimately, bitcoin is CODE and all that matters is the CODE and the integrity of the people maintaining it.  We've got a good bunch of people doing that and they have backup plans for backup plans for backup plans...
I know it's harder to see this when something you love so much is threatened; we immediately go into fight or flight mode.  But no good results come from taking actions out of fear.  
Truth is, there really is absolutely nothing to fear.  
So I would urge anyone worried, to remember our history, take a deep breath, and enjoy this beautiful journey, because there's a lot more history to be written in the months and years ahead.
In the meantime, keep learning and stay cool :)

I understand that, although there is so much work to be done (and redefining what is possible in your own life now that BTC has boosted your social mobility) I think we each have a duty to get out of reddit at times and see how we can shape our communities and explain what is happening to those we can influence in day to day life.  
This could be you starting a meetup group in your town if it doesn't exist, or as simple as taking the time to gently demonstrate bitcoin's utility to your parents / grandparents without pushing them too hard down the rabbit hole...  
Patience is the key here.  
Ultimately though, it's important we convey the message that Bitcoin is not a get rich scheme, it is not there to simply replicate old problems with shinier tech; we wanna' use it to enable everyone on the planet to finally escape greed, poverty and war.  
Fixing the disparity of wealth (*actual* wealth, not numbers in a computer) is crucial to getting to the moon - together :)))))
Price updates spoil that vision somewhat, both by making those who cannot afford a monetary stake yet feel excluded, and in terms of making it appear as if the same bunch of greedy westerners are going to repeat the same mistakes as those that came before.  Which the architects behind this (due to the system design) absolutely *cannot.*
All is good though, we'll get there :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:14:58
Exactly.  You have hit the nail on the head :)  
Right now we have, in most major western cities, the carbon copy dystopia you speak of, largely because economies of scale have lead to major chains being able to take over what were once close-knit communities.  It has worked well (at least ostensibly) in terms of international trade routes and a plethora of new exotic goods; there are now more people in the west living in relative abundant luxury than at any time in history.
However, actual levels of happiness are still no higher, depression being the number one 'disease' in the west.  Indeed, one only has to travel to 'impoverished' communities outside the west to witness first hand how community cohesion and a sense of unity and purpose within these communities often leads to far more levels of relative happiness than the luxurious consumer-driven lifestyles we have in the west.  Turns out that having that sense of purpose and a goal to strive for collectively is far more rewarding than material gains.  Not to mention the reduction in fear, paranoia, jealousy etc. that comes with knowing everyone in your community.  
Sit outside any Vietnamese home in any major city at night, for example, and you will see kids and old folks playing together around huge communal barbecues; very few houses have a cooker.  There is trust there you will not find in the west – we've had to outsource that to silicon and CCTV cameras to avoid total social collapse.  I choose Vietnam by the way, because there is no religion that binds them together (they are largely agnostic or buddhist).  But we can observe similar cohesion of this kind in India and even Malta and parts of Spain and Greece where religion and old 'family values' have played a part in holding communities together.  
But ultimately, the one-size-fits-all model that has crept into larger urban conurbations leads to a stifling of creativity and bottom-up enterprise within western communities.  Millennial's and Gen-Z are rejecting this kind of lifestyle.  They are not content with 9-5 or sitting infront of cable TV, they are more interested in buying 'experiences' over material things.  They don't want to stop learning, they want to travel, eat healthily and feel that the work they do is going to have a positive impact on the world. 
Couple that kind of thinking with this new technological renaissance and we now have an opportunity with this technology to help this new generation empower those communities who are collapsing under the weight of consumerism, and to help link them to the global village so that they can design and get access to trade channels and resources on the same level playing field as those faceless corporations that previously dominated the supply chain (and real estate).  This will lead to increased diversification and self-sufficiency within those communities as the oil ('money') that was hitherto controlled by a select few intermediaries will now flow freely to the local crowd via online crowdfunding style platforms.
As with everything though, it us up to 'leaders' within those communities to step up and harness these technologies and to thoughtfully and patiently help those in old corridors of 'power' understand and begin to embrace these new possibilities.  Most importantly, all of this must be done with humility, this is no longer a fight; everyone gets to 'win' if we conduct our affairs with integrity.  
It will take a few forward thinking cities to lead the way in this regard, but all the tools are now there and more accessible than ever, and I believe we are already seeing the beginnings of this new renaissance take hold in this regard.

LOL!  Absolutely, that's exactly what it's all about.  Bucky Fuller said it best "The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living."
Few people realise that everything in this world has been built by 'mad' people who never stopped being curious, wonderful, playful children.
I like to use the example of J.K. Rowling who sat for 4 years at the same cafe, with kids, on welfare, dreaming up Harry Potter.  Only to be turned down by 12 publishers, but she never stopped believing.  Had it not been for the welfare state affording her the time to do 'nothing' but pursue that which she was most passionate about Harry Potter wouldn't exist.  Same is true of the woman who came up with CATS the musical in that she could never sit still in class.  Today she would be proscribed with ADHD tablets.  Back then?  The doctor said "well she's a natural born dancer, the 'cure' is to send her to music school."
We didn't eradicate slavery, we just normalised it and dispersed it across all 'races' and with that came the idea that only 'special ones' get to escape: wear crazy clothes, do drugs and grace award ceremonies and the spotlight...
Modern tools like youtube, HD phone cameras, instagram photo filters, facebook livestream... only go to further pull back the wizards curtain and expose those emperors with no clothes as we slowly realise the obvious truth: we're all special, all capable of shining in our own unique way and enriching the world.  All we need is enough oxygen to do so.
All that's left then is a collective goal we can all share.  That goal must surely lie in the stars, and if the UK is anything to go by, the fact that NASA Tee Shirts are now amongst the highest selling items in those chain stores I mentioned previously... the meme is now firmly set in the cultural zeitgest and with it, the idea that we humans have a lot more exploring to do ;)
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:21:24
Socially, I see a bunch of interesting things happening in tandem where three 'groups' split off: Nomads who go back to the land and live simpler lives off-grid with access to all the modern luxuries we've been accustomed to with drone deliveries/pickups ensuring they're still able to access the global trade grid.  
I see another group preferring to create vast inner VR worlds which themselves will have in-world economies.  Many will no doubt opt to live in these worlds of their own creation and reject 'reality'.
A third group will begin the 'restoration' of the material world where modern day 9-5 slavery is eradicated and 3D printing, nano tech, AI and robotics do much of the heavy lifting (and thinking).  
In addition, we will begin to take exploration of outer-space far more seriously, and the new human narrative in this world of abundance (and potential immortality) will turn to thoughts on how we populate the solar system and beyond.
In a world where age reversal is possible and we think of our lifetimes in terms of millennia the 'race' slows down and fewer and fewer will elect to have children (we already see declining western populations right now).  Population growth will flatline and the nuclear family and 'child ownership' becomes increasingly rare lifestyle choices (mostly only happening in the above 'nomad' groups where children are seen not as 'belonging' solely to parents but part of the entire community).  Arguably, this is how we lived before monogamy became a thing with the invention of the plough and land ownership.
The only real barriers that stopped us all from getting there was, ironically, the 'economy' and a system that placed middlemen and gatekeepers reliant on profit margins and personal gain in the way of true innovation for the good of the entire species.  Even the majority of bitcoiners underestimate what blockchain is gonna' do to change all that.
If it all plays out as above, we live in a world where no resources go idle (cars, boats, land, gadgets) and the idea that every house on a street needed 2.4 cars or, say, their own lawnmower used for &lt; 0.0001% of its lifespan becomes absolutely retarded.

McAfee (who is relatively new to bitcoin) and his cohorts are a group that are yet to grasp that in this 'new world' we *all* get to be leaders regardless of wealth or status.  Neither do they grasp that the old world and new are currently working in tandem; that those fathers and mothers who have worked in the light holding onto the decaying threads of that old world are as proud as any that their children have figured out a way to solve problems that for so long eluded them.
These problems are not solved by creating another 1% or by seeing this as a game that will have winners and losers.  They won't be solved by people ploughing millions into mining farms who see accumulation of digits (be they in crypto or otherwise) as some kind of metric for success...  The problems will be solved by figuring out where best to spread those digits globally to ensure every single being on this planet has equal access to her resources and the means to live a dignified, unencumbered life.
We are at a pivotal moment in human history.  No-one knows how this is going to go, there are way too many variables.  Anyone who tells you they do, have no understanding of bitcoin or the internet and understand even less when it comes to the rather fuzzy field of human relations and emotional intelligence.
Be wary of false idols, especially those riven by the same avarice that required bitcoin be invented in the first place.
Never forget... this world, and how the future unfolds, is down to you as much as anyone else.  
So think for yourself about the kind of world you want to see in 10 years time.
Then step up, and lead the way.

Indeed, and I am pretty much in agreement with James D'Angelo when he talks of the need to remove anonymity from voting in the senate.  
However, it doesn't really apply to actors and companies in the bitcoin space who invariably need to conduct their business in the open.  The loudest voices then, are gonna' be scrutinized from every possible angle.  
Which means looking beyond the masks; to the information they choose to share; the friends they have in their circles; companies they are linked to and, above all, the way they speak to and treat others (especially those in disagreement with them).  It is then possible to make a broad assessment of the motivations behind certain actors as increasingly their online personas become irrevocably linked to the social capital and influence they have in the 'real' world.  
This is the same stuff Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen spoke about in [The New Digital Age]( and a result of the blurring of cyberspace and meatspace.  That blurring is only set to increase as we carry these personas into VR and beyond.  
And, of course, it all leaves a digital trace for future historians to trackback through when charting the history of humanity (of which bitcoin is surely to be a major stub).  So it would be wise at this juncture, to think "how do I want humanity to remember me?" for it is sure to all come back one day, good and bad...
Conflate all that with the openness and accessibility of github, bitcointalk, facebook, twitter, dev mailing lists and youtube talks/discussions and what you have, is the most transparent project build (of this magnitude) in the history of humankind.
Under such conditions, those working against bitcoin from the shadows, whilst they may come and go, will never earn enough trust to be able to influence the long term aspirations of this groundbreaking project.

That's the beautiful thing about democracy, if you don't want to 'cast your lot' you are perfectly entitled to not do so (simply don't vote).
The system is setup in such a way that if you really really want change, enough people can get together and enact it...  Think to the Arab Spring and the worldwide Occupy movement in modern times that have had such a huge impact on moving us all forward as a species.
This is the story of civilization, each new generation comes in and inherits the tools and ideas of their parents and applies them in new crazy ways that upsets the status quo.
The internet and speed of communication, and the fact that is borderless has merely amplified that in an unprecedented way, just as the printing press did in times gone by.
See the UK [Pamphlet Warz]( to see how all this played out with printing press technology...
At the end of the day, the only thing that really matters is information and ideas.  Which is why Einstein said "imagination is more important than intelligence."

Not that I condone these tactics any more than I condone buying up Adwords keywords like "Mycelium" to push your version of the hard fork or the underhand tactics of bitpay doing the same via blog posts, but it's perhaps worth pointing out that [Andreas predicted stuff like this back in march](  
(when discussing the implications of contentious hard forks and 51% attacks).
"Every bug in the software is going to get poked and then poked again... in every possible way and immediately.  
And if you try to fix it, you better write that code well because if you put another bug in that's gonna' get poked too... And then **it becomes a battle of who has the best software development team and how quickly they can maintain that code and keep uptime**.  This is not going to be an easy game..." — Andreas
Whether it's related to what's going on or just the usual 'poking' that goes on around bitcoin infrastructure, who knows.
Anyhow, let's hope they get it fixed and we all remember that there are normal, good people in the middle of this 'battle for bitcoin' that are relying on both 'sides' to get their shit together.

Since LN will be able to do atomic swaps, wouldn't it be able to convert to something *like* TetherUSD to shield users/merchants from market fluctuations until they wanna' cash out?
Since the end goal is to be in a world that requires no fiat off-ramp this seems like a pretty cool way to move forward and keep fluid money in crypto (without market risk) for as long as possible.
In the interim, something similar to the Bitwage API could be used for creating a gateway to and from fiat for those users/merchants that absolutely need to cash tethered coins out.

You are exactly right to say "the worst evil is committed by those with the best of intentions."
That's why we created law and all kinds of acts like the data protection act.  And that's why, in the UK we stripped the monarchy of their power and created so many chambers in the halls of power to balance things out (we have the lords full of wise old gurus and parliament that has the younger up and coming MP's; the gurus first look at ideas and problems and then pass them onto the young ones with their advice, then it gets passed back if there's a problem)... then there's various civil servants unattached to government that ensures no-one is cheating.  It's a beautiful balance of young and old working together and sharing inter-generational wisdom.
The Queen, although has no parliamentary power, is important as an influencer and as a massive hub of knowledge.
But we are straddling two worlds now: the internet and that old world...  We can kinda' look at the internet as Sir Tim Berner's Lee's vision of what a "Common Wealth" could truly be if we just freed all the worlds information and knowledge.  Information is the only real currency in this world after all.  Note how the UK never ever say "we are the greatest country on Earth" since they know the very idea is preposterous, given they were the first "Great Pirates" to get the travel bug and sail the world's great uncharted oceans.  
None of this is because the British are particular special, it's just they had a nice little comfortable "think tank" on a lush green island with no nasty predators to worry about.  So they had plenty of time to sit around and contemplate existence (cooking was the first technology that spurned the cognitive evolution of humans in that it gave us lots of time to sit around and divert energy to thinking as opposed to raw digestion and hunting / gathering).  Being small too, means they had to get along and sort differences out.  But they also dreamed of exploring and getting off that little island... so began building lots of big boats, taking information and ideas and trading with other nations ;)
All of that happened before of course in the incredible shipping port that was home to the Library of Alexandria, Egypt which was burnt down (we only recovered 0.2% of the information there).
So we get to now... Democracies, finance, governments and the internet are all a bit broken, (mostly because of the disruption the internet released onto the world but a lot because the internet was never supposed to be powered by advertising, and as soon as it became a for-profit business endeavour, things got very messy.  So for we computer scientists that have been in this a long time (I've been programming for 33 years), we have for a very long time been thinking how we get back to the original ethos of the early internet "Information wants to be free".
"The only thing we fear more than destruction is change, because destruction is something we are used to."
So back to law and government: Just as law is constantly evolving and updating to the changes happening, corporations too (which are just groups of people with a common purpose) need to adapt to new changes; just as they had to adapt to the ozone layer problem in the 80's and had to go CFC free or risk depleting the ozone layer.  It was again a UK scientist that finally proved beyond doubt we had to fix the Ozone layer (by crunching all the NASA data with a computer - it took them 10 years!).  We'd have no planet without that guy.
Democracies and Governments will adapt (and are adapting as we're seeing everyday with the positive announcements).  We will move toward Athenian style democracy where you will need to have actual knowledge (not certificates or degrees but proven knowledge) to vote in given areas.  We've seen a good 'Alpha' of how this "wisdom of well informed crowds" works within LukeDashJr's scaling vote collation the other day.
So, knowing that humans can be compromised when given power, and that the old systems are not fit for the new world, what must we do?  Well you're karma score on Reddit is again a good alpha of what social capital can be accrued when you're nice and kind and helpful on the internet (imagine if one day reddit converted all that karma to karma coin and bolted it onto the lightning network).
But money must not be the incentivisor since it's not actual wealth, it's just a measurement tool and the only things we really need to measure are resources and human energy.  As automation takes its hold, things will start making more sense and we will realise we didn't actually eradicate slavery, we just dispersed it across many races and normalised it via money as a motivator...  We look to the UK again to see how the welfare state it created (and NHS free healthcare) meant this tiny island could work as a sorta' massive incubator for very quick change  (a law can change in the UK overnight).  It realised, if they allowed everyone to live in dignity with a comfort blanket moneywise then those people doing 'nothing' would end up creating art and inventing things and just doing amazing stuff (J.K Rowling was on welfare for something like 7 years when she wrote Harry Potter).
Google were not incentivised by money either, there's tons of things they've done just for the love of creation - the artificial lab burger or even the automated car (they didn't have business plans and had no idea if they'd ever make money they just thought it would be great for humanity).  Same is true of many sites that have had to scale to millions of users because they became popular (because they were built with love, not for money).
So in future, companies if they want to exist will have to ask "Why?" Google would say we want to make sense of all the world's information.  Yahoo have said "to maximise shareholder profits".  
That latter why will become redundant as people, like with CFC carbons in the 80's will want to know the company they're trading with are morally and ethically doing a good thing for the world.
Bitcoin is about getting the 70% of the world (4 billion people unbanked) with access to the global economy and internet.  Change that we change EVERYTHING because it means economic migration ends as we empower individuals to run their own communities with nothing but a smartphone and a satellite uplink to the Blockstream sat.
There's lots more work to do and lots more unknowns, as many many sites are trying to figure out what amazing things are gonna' be possible in this new future.
If you're interested in all this, here's Austin Hill and Adam Back's vision of "Can't Be Evil".  I'd personally revise that strapline to "Must Be Good".
And here's the UK government's amazing report on Bitcoin and blockchain and how very excited about it they are (don't forget the UK gave the world SMS text messaging and the internet, so they know a thing or two about disruptive technologies ;) LOL).
Peace and thanks for all you do to support and spread the word of bitcoin :)

Constructive criticism based on objective, rational (and positive) discussion, yes.  Given my internet startup has been going 15 years or more, there would have been no way of achieving anything without that process between us all when major design / systems analysis decisions needed to be taken.
The key though, is operating to majority consensus in a non-hierarchical group where everyone has an equal share of voice.  That way no one person feels they need to be 'right' since it is 3 brains (or more) figuring out TOGETHER what is best for the group.

With regard to Albert: Einstein said socialism had its merits but did not pledge allegiance to any single political or idealogical position and his thinking on the subject evolved over time.  In fact, his exact words were "I believe that Gandhi’s views were the most enlightened of all the political men in our time. We should strive to do things in his spirit: not to use violence in fighting for our cause, but by non-participation in anything you believe is evil."
You can hear him saying this, in a lovely old audio snippet here:
Thanks for the fine discussion, very much enjoyed it.  And thanks for supporting bitcoin! 
Peace ☮️

I am familiar yes, even did research on the first rationalist magazine; but even they, I feel, end up in echo chambers of group think.  I like dipping in and out of everything; I'll go into a mosque one day, a church the next just to try to understand what is going on around me better and why groups come together and think what they do.
Found myself staying with an eclectic group of muslims for 6 months last year (of all types from moderates that drunk alcohol to more strict muslims that observed prayer rituals etc. all living happily together in a commune with western travelers from all over the world).  It was fascinating to learn about the faith properly from the source (instead of white people on TV talking about a culture they have never been a part of).  Even more fascinating was the debates they'd have within the various groups within the faith itself, and of course for me to sprinkle science over it all when questioning why they believed certain things.  My conclusion was we were all right and all wrong and that really all that matters is you're a good person (all religions are trying to say that when you cut it down to the essential core value systems behind them).
At the end of the day, I venture that we only join these groups to feel a sense of belonging and safety.  Cognitive dissonance occurs when our worldview is challenged (the exact same fight or flight kicks in as it might were we faced with a hungry predator) so when we are surrounded by 'the choir' all thinking and saying the same thing about our world outlook that fight or flight doesn't occur so we feel physically safer, even though it's all an illusion if you can accept the fact you might be wrong about everything and all that really matters is making the lives of those around you as enjoyable as possible whilst we push the human race forward toward exploring the stars and inner worlds of our own creation.
Extend it back even further and what does all of this really boil down to?  I think we all just wanna' know if we are alone in the universe or not.  
Getting to the moon, will be the first step to finally figuring all that out :)

What is BitPay if not a hub running from an SQL database that we have no idea is secure?  Worse, what is BitPay if not a centralised payment processor with opaque accounting and same old tired closed door predatory business ethics?
It's up to various companies building Sidechains / Drivechains and stuff like smart contracting through Rootstock to be open about what they're doing and EARN the trust of their users.
Fail at that and your sidechain project fails, but at least we know the underlying tech for moving stuff around isn't relying on an SQL database (with all our personal data on it) on someone's private server.
So it's up to individuals then to choose which sidechain project they like and trust, just as you are - through your language - expecting people to like and trust BitPay as a centralised SQL database closed server hub.
I have already seen Zap and how it may end up being a replacement for BitPay, and gotten to know Jack a little from his posts on here and on his blog.
He's a youngster who just wants to make the world a better place and has already turned down VC's and open sourced the entire thing.  So he has earned the trust of the community already by being so wonderfully open and transparent about all this.  
That's the first sidechain project that will get my patronage and shows how you can do really beautiful things in this space without resorting to "business has to be ruthless" tactics.  Indeed, if you resort to such a predatory old world mindset, you're not gonna' last too long in this new world of collaborative open innovation IMO.

See [GroupThink]( if you have a genuine interest in what is happening there.  Then ask yourself how you formed the opinions you have.  Was it from appeal to authority (and the most authoritative figures in the community there) or was it after reading whitepapers and forming your own opinions outside of the group?
At the end of the day, I can only show you the door and hope you see what I see.  
Fortunately the only thing that truly matters is the code, and the people who actually do the work to understand that code (and the whitepapers that birthed it).

The key is taking kids out of rote, structured learning and allowing them to stay curious and simply follow their passions.  Kids aren't sucking their thumbs in maths class because they're dumb, they're just not interested in the subject they're being force-fed.
Here is a good example I heard in a TED talk.  There was a young girl who could never sit still in class and found it hard to concentrate on the subjects she was being taught.  Today we would give her ADHD tablets...  Back then, the doctor her Mother took her to see simply asked her what she enjoyed doing "Dancing!" was the reply.  "Ahhh then the cure for you young lady is music and drama school!" 
That young lady went on to create CATS: The Musical.
(As an aside, I wouldn't be able to tell you about that TED talk were it not for the internet that gave me free access to it - TED talks use to be exclusively for the elites that could afford to attend).
I was terrible at maths, not because I was too stupid or had inherited poor intelligence (ironically, my Mother was the youngest woman in the UK to ever become a turf accountants manager and regarded a Maths genius.  Incidentally, Mother's - not Fathers - pass on the 'intelligence' gene).  
No, I was terrible at maths because it just didn't interest me.  
Luckily my school encouraged me to pursue the things that did.  I became head IT monitor at school (before IT was even a subject), head Librarian, started 2 school magazines...  Was great at history and biology, sucked at P.E., geography and chemistry.  
Would have been even better off to just let me double up on history, do more computer stuff, and forget about 'competing' against others in maths, geography, P.E., and chemistry.    
Now, with regard to your comment "we all knew from an early age how relatively smart we were" this is erroneous thinking - as recent studies have shown "when you encourage children and make them *think* they are 'smarter' than they are they actually *do* become smarter."
You really can do and learn anything with that brain of yours and it's never too late to do what all humans ought do and "go back to school and think about whatever it was you were thinking about before you were told you had to go and 'earn' a living" (as Bucky Fuller put it).
All it takes is effort, belief in your passion and a little encouragement from those around you :)

I don't profess to know the future, I have no great insight into how any of this will unfold since there are way too many variables at play to make any firm predictions.  But I will say this:


The fact that bitcoin's price held steady during the last maelstrom tells us the 'old guard' are really starting to believe in our ability to pull this off now.  The sheer amount of bitcoin marketing both online and in places like the London underground also tells me it is now beginning to permeate mass consciousness of ordinary working people in the West in much the same way it already has in places like Venezuela and India.  


Bitcoin has already [worked its way into popular culture]( via TV Shows, Hollywood movies, music and art.  In that respect the 'war on consciousness' that eventually leads to mass adoption is already 'won', which was always going to be the hardest part of this 'struggle'.  I am frankly amazed and humbled at how far we've come from the early days where we were considered nothing but a fringe group of lunatics (some would argue we still are but Reddit subscriber count and meetup group attendance worldwide says otherwise).
The fact that BCH's price didn't plummet also tells us that those who don't believe in the core principles and see bitcoin as a money-making enterprise now have a nice playground to feel that their ideas are being listened to which will enable them to do things a different way, just as bitcoiners funding Ethereum allowed Vitalik et al to try things in a different way.  
This is good, the devil makes work for idle hands; and the last thing we need is for any 'out-group' to feel disenfranchised and without a voice.  Afterall, bitcoin is for everyone, including those people who don't believe bitcoin is for everyone ;)   
If there's a 2X fork we can see this as yet another alt that will relieve pressure on core with all three groups able to breathe in different waters governed by different rulesets (and different ideas about what the future of this space might one day look like).  
**The net result actually leads to a stronger bitcoin.**  
Rather than needing to soak up wave after wave of speculative pressure, each 'version' gets to prop up the ecosystem as further innovation unfolds with nearly identical blockchain mechanisms in place.  Much like, prior to this, alt coins have helped spread out the investment (both economic and cognitive) in the space.  Imagine what a mess bitcoin would be if all those people with whacky (and sometimes brilliant) ideas in the alt space only had bitcoin to play with.
Ultimately, three closely related bitcoins may lead to the Lightning network eventually creating a bridge between them (much how Charlie Lee envisaged bitcoin and litecoin working in concert) that enables triple 'blockchain lock-ins' of sensitive datasets for things like visa issuance, housing and land title registry for instance.  This would also mean one blockchain going down for maintenance (or flat out failing) would not necessarily mean 'Game Over' for anyone relying on one sole blockchain for data integrity.  


More interesting, perhaps, is that no-one signing NYA (bar the usual suspects) have come out to say they intend to honour the agreement.
As usual, everything in bitcoin world, [is up in the air]( ;)

Owning bitcoin != understanding bitcoin or what it means for the world at large, nor does it excuse ignorance.  
In much the same way as owning a bank card doesn't mean you understand the various complexities of the banking infrastructure and fractional reserve system that lead to the need for bitcoin to be created in the first place.

If you look back over the comment you will notice I wrote the words "If we must *listen* to anyone, listen to those who DON'T seek to impose subjective viewpoints..."
Logical conclusion of that is it seems *you* are the one not listening (listening extends to reading and understanding what the other person is trying to communicate on reddit / messenger as much as it does the spoken word).  
I even gave the example of Andreas (who has been invited to speak all over the world and has been a key educator and influencer).  Look up to those wise elders (of all ages!) by all means, and ask yourself "what is it in the way they speak that leads them to find so much peace amidst the chaos?"  Then [stand on their shoulders]( and lead the way.  
The notion of a debate btw, implies there must be a winner or loser.  Which is a little retarded given there are way too many variables in this grand project we call bitcoin for any one person to be absolutely right.
In the end, better for the group as a whole to [not play the (zero sum) game at all](

That's good, we don't need to be scared if we're decent, honest people.  In such a scenario bad players and companies (at all levels) are those that need to worry about the digital footprint they leave behind.
Google has done more to fight for net neutrality and protect the freedoms of the individual and have been more committed to transparency than any company in this space.  Just look at the fight they made for Youtube so we could all enjoy access to the unfettered knowledge and art it gives to us.
And all this comes from the moral foundation it was built on was to be a good, ethical company.  Same with Bodyshop and many others that followed the Don't Be Evil philosophy.  
It's only screwed up somewhat (like so many internet companies) because we were all forced to fund our sites with advertising.  But contrast Google+ with facebook (G+ has no ads) and you will realise Google have been playing the long game there just as we all have with bitcoin.  Patience is the key.  Good things come to those who wait as they say.
You see, originally the web was supposed to be powered by micropayments not advertising.  The best qualitative content would be that which thrived then, just like TV, it got subverted when in 1996 big business swooped down and the dotcom bubble began...  It's been a constant battle since then.
We've seen the same play out with bitcoin but in a much, much shorter timespan.
As bitcoin evolves and physical cash becomes obsolete, the public ledger begins to show everything, it ensures all actors remain good without any individual, government or corporation needing to be the arbiter of what 'good' is.  Eventually it devolves to a fluid democracy where each individual can vote on micro and macro decisions within their sphere of interest / knowledge domain.  This enables us all to simply rebuild communities with nothing more than good ideas the rest of the community back.
Not saying they're perfect, but we can trust Google for getting us this far, and building and encouraging devs to create tools that will get us even further to that holy grail of all information being free.  But it starts with a future where no good people need to fear being open about everything they do.
Future looks so very exciting...  But as always, it's the journey and the building of this new world that is the most fun part ;)

It's true of ordinary folk in my experience.  I spent close to two years trying to get a very smart friend onboard with the idea whenever it came up in conversation but he was highly skeptical (this is why he is smart).  Only when he actually downloaded a wallet and I sent him a small amount, did he go "oh wow!" and realise what a game changer it is. 
I'm sure Janet has seen it in action, and she's more than aware it's the future, since it's what ordinary people in the early adopter demographic and what experts most well versed in computer science, want to be using... However she's also aware that whenever she opens her mouth on certain subjects she has the potential to destabilise the entire economy if she says the wrong thing.
The new world of Bitcoin is not yet ready for mass adoption, nor is the old world ready for a crypto bank run.  
At the moment she needs to just quietly keep the stalemate in place as that old world catches up and figures out how to adapt to the seismic changes on the horizon.  
Seems to me, she's a master chess player saying exactly the right things to keep everything chugging along...  The rest, is up to the engineers of the new world building all this.

Please read my full comment again; I didn't say modding of this nature didn't exist and even said I may have been modded a few times myself (and likely deserved to be.)


I trust the people in here to do their best to keep this community going (which includes shutting me up with a block button if I'm angry/stressed and talking crap)...  Just like if you're in a bar and you say stuff that might get you in trouble or you just start smoking in there which is gonna' get you kicked out 'cause there's a 'no smoking' rule... you are going to respect your friends coming along and telling you to calm down / put the cigarette out, to keep the peace and make your life better and the lives of those around you who don't want smoking / angry shouting in the bar, better.
If you focus on the positives in this: today your comments seem fine and you're not being modded, so all is well.
I try to just focus on the great things happening and not worry about the technical side too much; even though I'm a computer scientist I'm not actively involved in the core group aside from passively reading the dev mailing list, so I don't feel qualified to comment on the super technical stuff.  I do, however, have full confidence in the people who are involved and the consensus process in place, since it's their passion.  
Happily, I have found my own passion in all this and I feel I'm making a positive and helpful contribution to the overall project, as do many others...  so all these "working-groups" get to do their thing and report back to r/bitcoin base and share all the good stuff they've been doing!  This is actually much like how the internet itself works with W3C working groups.
We are all connected and you are as important to bitcoin as everyone else; it's great when you find your passion in this (maybe like me, it's not technical discussions, but perhaps there's something else you're amazing at – art, music, you name it, there's going to be a group of bitcoiner's that share your passion and something positive and worthwhile you can contribute).

That's not a debate you're describing, it's a discussion which I'm all for.  
I think, it's all in the language we use and respect we give each other and differing ideas. Including rudely proclaiming "this is the dumbest shit" instead of "but, have you considered..."
Of course, I'm in the same school of life and this is just my subjective viewpoint, as much as yours are yours.  Feel free to disagree.

*sometimes* is the problem, there was wayyyyyy too much noise and schadenfreude going on in buttcoin for anyone to be able to devote any attention to it.
I think it was Nick Szabo who observed awhile back "It's infinitely easier to generate noise than it is to deflect."
Buttcoin was like that (the braying masses laughing at the black sheep who dived over the fence and dared to be different).  Now it's basically a cult comedy classic archive which I kinda' hope survives in this new world and continues (backed by bitcoiners) as a sort of hilarious parody of itself.

Why are you all so paranoid about government 'agents' (whatever they are)?  The point of decentralised sidechains is not because anyone fears governments or banks, but to simply streamline the entire process so we can do away with ageing infrastructure (and substandard tech implementations that leak data).  
Eventually banks AND governments will want to embrae these things just like they wanted to use computers when it went from a hobbyist movement to having real world practical implementations.  
The key is balancing all the joblessness this automation is going to bring (this goes for every tech / job area) and doing it in a slow, humane way so we can avoid the kind of crazy scenes we saw in places like the UK when coalminers went on strike due to the coal industry getting a massive clean energy tech 'upgrade'.  Prior to that, same story with the 'luddites' smashing farming equipment.
We've had Visa/Mastercard bitcoin debit cards for years, UN and Governments trailing bitcoin UBI pilots and so on, it's early stages but clear everyone is on the same side... We humans are like that, strip away all the nonsense and we all just want the best for each other really.  
That's why we're all still here ;)

Sure but it was users of this subreddit that asked that highly technical discussions like scaling go through appropriate  channels staffed by scientists and engineers working on this (github / dev mailing list / bitcoin improvement channels) wherever possible.  Therefore the subreddit has evolved its utility over time (just as bitcoin has).
Back in the early days, when the community was much smaller there was a similar thing that happened with market discussion.  Most in here are not traders or speculators and so politely asked those that wanted to discuss those things to form another reddit discuss that.  Iin the end, they formed a brilliant community called which still goes strong to this day.
It's a win-win.
For technical discussions involving the computer scientists / ideas / proposals building this here are some great channels:

I'm not criticizing at all and everything you say is spot on (except there are no actual experts since that suggests they've learnt all that can be learnt about a given subject), all I'm cautioning against is cypherpunks getting too big headed and thinking they are more or less important than any other people on planet Bitcoin.

Lol, could we not say the same of BitPay / Shapeshift / Coinbase and all the other centralised services out there?  Do you have any clue what Jeff et al are doing with your KYC?  Have they encrypted your data properly on their centralised SQL hubs?  Have they had proper security / accounting / server audits?
Given that Gale seems a genuine nerd who is just incredibly passionate about seeing bitcoin succeed who has just fully announced her private information in the reddit, I'd say she is a person that can be trusted unless proven otherwise.  Given she's asking for help and announcing she will pay people for good work, I guess more and more trust will be built up over time.
I will remind you that Ross Ulbricht started Silkroad this exact same way by dropping his gmail addy on bitcointalk asking for devs to help with TOR.  That's how bitcoin was built - trust your fellow human until they betray that trust.  Indeed, it's how all village communities operated &lt; Dunbar's number.
At the end of the day though, whether you trust Gale / Jeff / Shapeshift is down to you.  The advice is always the same, don't leave bitcoin on an exchange for long periods of time unless you are comfortable there's a risk (and that goes for every single service that requires these Layer 1 centralised kludges).  After Lightning of course, different story, no need for dirty hacks of this kind.  
Either way, Jeff / Gale / Coinbase should be applauded for the bravery, creativity and passion they have given to helping push bitcoin forward and for coming up with ideas that have become actual reality.  Beats sitting around all day cynically deriding good people on reddit anyhow :p 
P.S. Amazing work Gale, this looks awesome!

This gets even more powerful when something like TetherUSD is backed by government central bank funds / bonds and even gold and silver atomic swaps.  
We kind of already do have all sorts of early stage versions of those things via some dirty 'hacks' various companies in this space have done (TetherUSD being one), LN / Sidechains just makes it all beautifully clean and safer for incumbents like those central banks to start getting involved.
I see BitPay as one of those dirty hacks too, a kinda' v1.00 hybrid of old and new world fused together that is rapidly depreciated after Layer 2 Bitcoin tech starts rolling out.
Which is why I agree with OP, BitPay ought to innovate here instead of trying to fight the disruption that's coming.  
Ironic, given those are the very same arguments BitPay et al used to justify their own inception!

I was thinking more of making use of the idle time time when people are charging (especially during the 8-10 hours at night when most of us have phones plugged into the wall doing nothing).  It was initially something Kim Dotcom mentioned over skype during a bitcoin conference a year or so ago that got me thinking along these lines, not sure how realistic it is yet...
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:07:10
I'm kinda' a massive massive history buff, and I think it's fair to say it's wayyyyy more complex than that.
Churchill wanted to 'finish the job' after the Victory in Europe but the UK people had had too much austerity and could take it no longer.  Strangely though, they'd never been healthier because of meat rationing.   
Meanwhile Einstein had urged Roosevelt to pursue the atomic bomb since he feared the Germans would be developing it... Turns out they weren't and Einstein forever rued sending the letter.  He later had said NO NATION should be given that much power and that all nukes should be left in the charge of the UN.
Einstein was offered the presidency of Israel in 1952 which he turned down.
There's silver linings in everything of course.  Churchill losing the election did lead to the creation of the welfare state / NHS and it was an amazing leap forward...  but one must wonder if Hiroshima woulda' happened had he still been leading the allies.
Charlie Chaplin, who left America in 1953 because of being accused of being a socialist (he wasn't anything) feared that the American Industrial complex was now out of control as did so many others.  Charlie opposed Hitler before the American government did and in his first speaking movie "The Great Dictator" (in 1938) used his amazing art to reach out across the airwaves and plead for sanity.  
He was born within 3 days of Hitler.  It's worth remembering that Hitler was a failed artist (his art is amazing!) and probably idolised Charlie whose trademark moustache style he seemed to copy (he saw the movie and thought it was incredible).  No internet or mass media back then of course to send Charlie's message out to the world so only a small coterie of elites got to hear his words.
One of the British politicians spent 10 years of his life travelling to and from America to try and convince them it was morally bankrupt to be charging the UK interest on loans for doing their part to save the world from facism.  
In that sense, the UK and her allies actually LOST WWII; they only finished paying back their WWII debt to the Americans in 2006, which lead to them either going bankrupt or debasing Sterling Silver (the strongest currency in the "common wealth" and world).
And let us not forget the Russians lost more troops than anyone.  No Russia, no Victory.  But of course it took the entire of Europe pulling together to make it all happen.
There's loads more beautiful crazy stories, like training 50,000 pigeons to find U-Boats and deliver messages to spies in Europe (2 of them received the Victoria Cross for pigeon bravery, ha!) and every citizen of Malta received the Victoria cross (although the UK could only afford to send two - one as backup).  That's why there's a cross on the Maltese flag btw, it's the VC cross.
Then there's Agent ZigZag, the only spy in history to get both the Victoria Cross and Iron Cross (the German equivalent of the VC - Germans thought he was on their side)...  And of course Alan Turin and the Bletchley park crew who cracked Enigma thanks to Polish people getting them an Enigma machine...
The war has been ongoing ever since as George Orwell explained in 1984 (this is a book every British Child at school reads, alongside Lord of the Flies and Watership Down, at least back in my day).
The modern day follow-up would be Little Brother by American author Cory Doctorow.  It's fab.  
We could go onto discussing how Music and art exported from the UK (Beatles "all you need is love" etc.) during Vietnam / Cuban missile crisis did more than a little to bring Peace to Vietnam... and... well... how far down the rabbit hole do we go?
It's true though, if there's anything to learn from all this, it's that: all we need is love and lols (and maybe a cup of tea ;).  
[Rest Peacefully Charlie](
Keep calm and carry on! 
EDIT: One small caveat, when I say 'the' Americans I am not saying the entire nation agreed on these things (America and her people, like all countries, are awesome when you strip away the nonsensical tribalism).  As with so much in this world, it was only a tiny tiny fraction that made those choices at the time and I am sure they thought they were doing the right things... 
Afterall "the worst evil in this world is committed by those with the best of intentions."  Today is no different, hence bitcoin and the many people / companies at the epicentre of this technology are creating blockchain in the image Sir Tim Berners-Lee originally had for the internet (information wants to be free).
Consider this a framework for building a completely incorruptible system where no evil can be committed again.
Adam Back et al call this "Can't Be Evil" but i prefer the term "Must Be Good".  Alphabet (Google's sister company) coin the new corporate philosophy "Do the right thing."  We'll get there :)

In a similar way to how [nerdalizer do this with distributed servers]( which double up as household heaters / aircon units. 
Another exciting development is [bitfury's lightbulb]( which they built on necker island as a proof of concept.  As mining chip costs come down, we can expect mass consumer driven mining networks to be the next logical step toward further decreasing centralised points of control, especially now Nvidia and AMD are taking a keen interest in the space.  
Could the Bitcoin PoW algorithms eventually evolve to work with a specialised mining chip built by Nvidia shipping with all new PC's and macs?  Could those algos be tweaked to actually do productive folding type work whilst securing the network in parallel?  Certainly, if it can be built by software architects and it's within the realms of possibility (it is) then such a development cannot be ruled out.  That's the thing with Bitcoin, it's rapidly evolving code, not a company that stands still subject to hierarchical leadership constraints.  As such we must be prepared to expect the unexpected. 
Indeed, I would hazard a guess that the first team that manages to ICO a viable solution to this will have on their hands, the most successful ICO on the planet.  After all , back in the day, ASIC MINER managed to do a loose 'ICO' before we even backed ethereum.

I realise of course that reading complex technical papers isn't everyones cup of tea, but the beauty of bitcoin is that anyone who is humble enough to take the time to understand what this incredible project ultimately means for the world, will be able to find a way of making the most of their unique set of talents in helping with its construction.
Those that have jumped down that rabbit hole (for the right reasons) invariably come out finding they are surrounded by some of the brightest, kindest and most diverse group of people on the planet.

Isn't it all just unfolding beautifully towards a new fearless future?
Being an 80's child I remember how all this happened before during the great Ozone layer scare, before one maverick scientist proved beyond doubt that we were in our final hour providing the spark humanity needed to shift to CCF free products...
The most influential work on this front from a cultural perspective during the time came from British author and comedian, Ben Elton...  
[This Other Eden - Ben Elton]( predicted exactly what's going on now.  Bitcoin hedge funds of the super rich being the cyber equivalent of Ben's 'Claustrospheres'.
Whilst there are some exciting twists and turns ahead in the story of bitcoin, the future is now more certain than ever, just as it was when major fridge and aerosol manufacturers began stamping their products with "CFC FREE" in the 80's.  We have already crossed the chasm towards an unbreakable unity of people focussed on the light (information) and a flight from the darkness (lack of information).

Yeah I read this :)
I mean ViaBTC got what they wanted, which is BCC, so why rock the boat?  Ultimately, we must acknowledge miners and pools invested a lot of time and energy in building their empires...  Empires that are already looking to me to be on their last legs.  
I am somehow reminded of the actual miners strikes in the UK during the 80's...  
Although those miners suffered terribly as a result of the government pulling the rug from under their industry (and the resultant job losses), one surely can't argue that today isn't a better world without the pollution and harsh conditions that those miners faced underground day in day out.
The future *has* to be consumer level mining chips in practically every device that uses electricity.  It kills not only the ridiculous waste of energy we're seeing, but ensures no players with vested business interests can ever again threaten the network via closed door agreements.  
If these companies truly have the best intentions for bitcoin at heart, then they should be exploring ways of getting mining chips into smartphones and laptops.  If they don't, they will go the way of the *actual* miners during 80's Britain.

Yeah but it's the third film you ought pay attention to ([Zeitgeist: Moving Forward](  Especially the sections on epigenetics with Gabor Mate, when he talks about the rat experiments and the dutch winter hunger crisis.  Jacques Fresco's Venus Project insights are also incredible; his take on what went wrong during the great depression are remarkable and eye opening.
But, most importantly, rather than just outlining the problems, the film shows viable solutions; how a resource based economy makes sense, and how it might be achieved via a 'world computer' monitoring all global resources.  Many computer scientists began pondering on this, and how it might be built back in 2012.
Clearly bitcoin+rootstock/ethereum *are* that computer.
Peter has since continued down the path of 'fighting', and I've been banging on at him publicly for the last few years in the hope that he would come to understand how bitcoin/ethereum have now all but rendered his fears for the future obsolete; mostly to no avail (he's not a computer scientist and it takes a heck of a lot of research for non-techies to grok all this). 
So, good to see him finally taking notice of the crypto space; I hope that he can channel all that he has been working on into more positive action, now that we have all helped create the tools for the visionary ideas his film collates to become reality.  
He and ZMF will go down as a pivotal turning point in all of this, just as Snowden et al have.  Now we just have to see if he has a reason for getting out of bed in the morning if he realises there is no longer anything he needs to 'fight' for.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:56:22
Woooh that's quite the repertoire you have there, great read, thanks :)  And very similar story to me, my head is full of about 17 or so different computer languages as I first started coding at like 7 just as the first ZX Speccy was released (well 5 really if you include the 2 years prior when BBC Micros came into schools... Though coding was down to pressing the big red BREAK button whilst the teachers weren't looking and wondering what all those weird lines of stuff did if I changed things).  Then after Speccy onto Amigas...  head is a mess of Procedural and OOP, as I grew up as everything was still evolving and did 2 different CS degrees.  (I feel people will be saying this about Bitcoin / LN / Rootstock one day).  Lectuers had no idea what to teach us as it was all still evolving so rapidly, so they figured they'd better teach us a bit of everything (business, law, psychology, maths, animation, design, you name it.)
They saw computers would change every single part of society, so they better get the first group clued up on everything.  
But I sucked at maths 'cause I had no interest in it lol, had to retake it and blag my way through the maths part of my CS degrees (I am proof that you don't need to know how to do maths to program :p)  But I LOVED design as well, I guess I musta' been one of the first kids in the UK to master using a Mouse and Paint programs on the Spectrum... Look at this [BEAST](  Hahaha.  7 years later, they just started coming into schools... People had no idea what they were as IT wasn't even a school subject until my 2nd year at high school (kids would pick them up and wave them around in the air and I would be like errrr... ok I'm just gonna' play Lemmings here on the Archimedes whilst you all figure that shit out...lol).
My fervor and enthusiasm for computers and internet was not shared by many... they just thought I was 'weird'.  And so I didn't really talk about them much to people who didn't get them, which was cool as I'd go out playing football too, or listening to music, playing in the park / woods...  
I only realised recently, that bitcoin has been the same for us all, but global... Just as I would get a blank stare when I'd say to people "have you heard of computers?" that's what bitcoin was like just a few years ago...  Now, well yeah, everyone's heard of bitcoin.  It will go the same way as computers did, just as the internet did when I was talking to people about email and they'd be equally nonplussed...  But gradually, people will get used to it and start trusting it just like the did with email instead of the post office.  
I remember back in the day when my English teacher told me "Sooner you get your head out of computers books the better.  Computers are a passing fad."...  Only time I ever lost it with a teacher, stood up and shouted "With respect sir you are full of shit"... Promptly go thrown out.
Wonder how many kids today have been shouting at their elders "Bitcoin is the future." and being met with the same hubris?
Funny thing about Amigas and that whole scene was we kinda had the internet before the internet, there was a huge public domain movement where we just shared everything swapping disks.  Man shoulda' seen my collection.  Obviously we ended up getting exposed to info and knowledge that only our 'wise elders' woulda been privy to, then you realise it *was* our wise elders giving us all that info - we were their insurance policy to preserve art, culture and knowledge incase the 10 million other backup plans they'd put in place didn't work out :p 
Kinda' like how Plan B now, *literally* has 10,000 Alt backup plans :p
Then games like Sim City, Civilisation, Monkey Island, Elite II: Frontier) that teach you everything from how to do space trading, strategising, running the world and seeing how its all built on trading and inventions, and yeah being a city mayor managing budgets).  Heck, even Frogger on the speccy taught us epic road crossing skills :p
Think I played Elite for like 72 hours straight once with no breaks, until reality merged into the computer and I thought I was actually in space trading minerals and medicines from distant galaxies, lol.  Meanwhile my friends were making music, and making Acid house demos, and we were all digitizing stuff from VHS videos and TV and sound sampling, others had insane pirated VHS movies, we created like this massive movement I guess of learning and creativity in this new nascent tech that no-one really knew how to use apart from us kids... The UK was insane during those days if you were a computer nerd.  It's no wonder we all went a bit loopy lol.  
There's still a thriving demoscene to this day.  [Check this beautiful video made by Fairlight]( (a game cracking crew back in the day).
 
But yeah, I come to understand as I get older, it's no different to ages gone by: Churches lead to public libraries and universities, and so on... which lead to the Library of Alexandria (the internet of its time - we only recovered like 0.2% of the information they gathered, how crazy!)... But yeah, this is how it works: each generation that bit wiser than the last because of all the wisdom passed down by those giants whose shoulders we get to stand on.  The internet changed everything, probably not a coincidence it came from a British guy surrounded by us kids going "Mom look what we made! :)"...  The internet just took our little public domain movement and made it global...  And of course, Tim knew it would lead to chaos but that eventually the truth would find its way through the darkness (as all good history books taught those elders)...  
Ada Lovelace predicted exactly what computers were gonna' end up doing of course, so it's fair to say the wise elders have been thinking 30 years ahead constantly drawing up backup plan after backup plan not knowing what the chaos will lead to but knowing that if we keep reminding everyone that history teaches us time and time again if we remember "all you need is love" we will figure it all out...    
Which is why UK schools were flooded with BBC Microcomputers and we were the first nation to arm the populace with [Teletext]( (kinda like a really slow internet via the TV) which you could book flights through and read the news and all kinds esoteric things, but also get Subtitles on all the TV shows - we like to look after people in the UK so they did all kinds of cool things for the deaf here...  
Mostly I used it for football results and a weird puzzle game called Bamboozle though :p 
I had / have millions of ideas for games too but, like you, never had the ability to sit down and figure out how to do it (was too much maths back in the day) but UNITY and stuff looks very doable nowadays.  Daresay you could create something amazing if you put your mind to it. 
Who knows, you get old(er), you start putting it all together, this huge puzzle that got us here, and realise everyone is beautiful and we all just want the best for the world and fear it all ending, and forget just how beautiful the journey is when you accept you can't really control anything but your own mind and whether you decide to look at the universe as being friendly or hostile...
Man I could write for years about this.  End of the day though, I'd just say this:  Don't worry too much about high marks in the certificates, Steve Jobs didn't, he just focused on what he was passionate about, sounds like you're in a position (with your 10 years head start to help a lot of your classmates out and forge some really beautiful bonds with people, when you finish, may be you will have the people around you to do your own bitcoin startup :) )... 
It's never easy this climbing the mountain... But if you believe in the beauty of your dreams enough, by hook and by crook, you will get there.  
And if you are nice and kind to those people who come into your life, they will find a way to help you get there.

Then again, I have tried to do a whole lot of research on the loudest voices posting there.  Take JohnnySnipe's "redditor for one week" [alt-right posts]( (who has just posted the 'Jesus Christ' comment above) for example.
Question is, what share of voice should people like JohnnySnipe have when it comes to bitcoin and complex technical discussions like the scaling debate?  Is he/she just considered by Roger et al to be one of his foot soldiers parroting the lines of the commander-in-chief, or is it a case of 'any noise is good noise?'.
That's the thing with the whole crypto-anarchist, voluntaryist movement Roger and people like Jeff Berwick (who is aligned with Alex Jones) represent - they have an ideological agenda to push and see bitcoin as a tool to drive that, whereas in truth, it is a technology that will always remain agnostic to political worldviews and idealogical pretensions.  
Not saying they're intrinsically bad people btw.  After all, some of the worst evils in this world are committed by those with the best of intentions.

We forget of course that economists and political philosophers are human beings first and foremost; they only become those things when we put labels on each other.

Based on what metric? 
I mean, I might be wrong here. I can't see into the future.  
I'm purely looking at this through the eyes of a computer scientist that's been programming for 33 years and recognises systems of this scale are gonna' have teething problems growing up, but...from what I'm seeing, a non-segwit compatible BCH run by devs ignorant to what LN and Blockstack means for creating Layer 2 solutions has no long term future capable of fulfilling the needs of IoT, machine payable web and yes, those all important western retail purchases.
 I guess it depends if you measure success in terms of short term market gains or long term viable Layer 2 products capable of rebuilding the fabric of both the internet and the very socio-economic structures that govern meatspace. 
As a programmer, designer and systems analyst, I'm more interested and excited in the latter and building amazing things that bring the world closer together.  Indeed, many of the whitepapers and ideas I've had over the last three years have been waiting for LN (although a few could have been done on BTC/BCH as it stands with some dirty centralised kludges).  
I daresay then, same is gonna' be true of the myriad developers working on stealth projects at YC etc.  
As such, I have no interest in the market cap or price (although money tends to come in as a by-product when you build cool stuff people wanna' use).   
Perhaps at the root of all this then, that's the fundamental disjunct going on here?

Thanks for the Link.
The research you have linked to is mostly based on old (pre-internet generation) studies and doesn't factor in the relatively new field of behavioral epigenetics.
Even so, from the same Wiki with the twins study you cited, we see environment is key:
- Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.  It may seem reasonable to expect that genetic influences on traits like IQ should become less important as one gains experiences with age. However, that the opposite occurs is well documented. **Heritability measures in infancy are as low as 0.2, around 0.4 in middle childhood**, and as high as 0.8 in adulthood.
- In simpler terms, IQ goes from being **weakly correlated with genetics, for children, to being strongly correlated with genetics for late teens and adults**.  Recent studies suggest that family and parenting characteristics are not significant contributors to variation in IQ scores; however, poor prenatal environment, malnutrition and disease can have deleterious effects.
*This strong correlation in late teens and adulthood is most likely again, due to environment (poverty and wealth inequality restricting access to good schooling, rich environmental stimuli, and the inevitable reduced social mobility that comes with that).*
- One proposed explanation is that people with different genes tend to seek out different environments that reinforce the effects of those genes.  The brain undergoes morphological changes in development which suggests that age-related physical changes could also contribute to this effect.
- A common error is to assume that a heritability figure is necessarily unchangeable. The value of heritability can change if the impact of environment (or of genes) in the population is substantially altered.  **If the environmental variation encountered by different individuals increases, then the heritability figure would decrease.** On the other hand, if everyone had the same environment, then heritability would be 100%.

This is sooooo cool mate :)
I envisage something epic using google maps one day, with full nodes appearing as throbbing production centres, whilst merchants using and accepting bitcoin appear on the map as places of interest with all other places greyed out.  All accompanied by bitcoiners on electric bikes zipping down cycle paths as they go in and out of places and interact with merchants.  
Scan over to China, and it's just a gigantic hive of mining power pumping electronic 1's and 0's into the air ;)

Ultimately it's down to us all as individuals to educate ourselves as Henry is suggesting.  As such, we don't need to unify the two 'camps'.  
That's the beauty of all this.  As with BCH, in the end, the code will ensure they will reap what they sow.
Feel no remorse for those that fell for cheap advertising tricks and got carried away with the price and promise of riches...  Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme.  It's a fix the frickin' world scheme.

It's kinda' like saying "why does twitter limit me to 140 characters and force me to link to complicated blogging services, when I just wanna' post my 4000 word dissertation!"
Roger and the big block crew are all very lovely people who have played an important role in promoting bitcoin awareness over the years; but they are not scientists and really should have absolutely zero say in how the code is developed.  
Indeed, had they not caused such a hoo-hah these last few years, we'd probably already have scaled to the size of visa and beyond with off-chain 'complicated blogging services' like Lightning network to deal with millions of instant (and in some cases zero fee) transactions for micro-payments and western retail purchases.
When the very grand visions of Blockstack and the myriad Sidechain initiatives start unfolding, and things like Brave browser roll-out properly, we're gonna' see billions of micro transactions happening on the machine-payable web (imagine Google and Yahoo being charged tiny fees for collecting search data on your website, or every youtube video being paid out in realtime to the content owners and publishers).
With that future in mind, the entire idea of doing every single micro transaction through the blockchain is preposterous if you want large scale institutions, merchants and the entire retail industry running services on top of the bitcoin blockchain.  None of that can happen on-chain (even with 8mb blocksize) without significantly bloating the blockchain over time and, in addition, we limit the openness of bitcoin; only those with access to expensive hardware / bandwidth are able to onboard.  
Given we want to ultimately see bitcoin rolled out to the 4 billion people on this planet without access to basic banking and internet services, a big block future is incongruent with that broader vision.
Which brings us to where we are today.  Those who grok the above and see how incredible the future is going to be with off-chain scaling in place are prepared to sacrifice short-term gains in performance over security (without losing sight of those long term aspirations).  
So yes, ultimately bitcoin is going to be an amazing payment instrument when all the above is ready, but right now bitcoin is playing a more important role in the world by securing assets in places suffering currency pressure like Venezuela and India.
As for the others who simply rage "MOAR BLOCKS NOW!" - well, they should probably drink less coffee ( ;) ) and chill out whilst the architects behind all this (and the users themselves) figure out the best path forward :)

Of course it is all down to how much control the mothers and fathers believe they can exert over their offspring now that one of those half-brothers has been let out into the wild and has seen with open eyes, the big wide world...whilst the other hides in the shadows of plato's cave, quite content in the faux bubble wrapped protection the father's favouritism ostensibly affords.
Luckily the brother that travels will embrace this unknown and through it, know [the world and everything in it]( and, whilst the family may get postcards, they will never get to taste, smell and touch that air from deep within the cave...  Nor will they realise that the whole of the human family *is* family, all sons and daughters of mitochondrial Eve.
Thus is the burden unleashed by over-controlling patriarchs riven by greed who cannot see that having one son or daughter to one wife he truly loves is really all he needed if he truly believed in equality for all humankind.

I absolutely DO agree with you.  
In fact, I have written very little code in this space because I have been wearing so many other hats (bridging the old business world with the new world, attending panel discussions at banks, talking with politicians, educating artists about what's going on etc. etc.).  Having spent time listening to them speak on panels, I have complete trust and faith in the integrity of the guys who are maintaining the repo.  
 
This has been the ride of my life and an incredibly humbling experience to see such a diverse group of people, skills and professions all coming together around a single technology we all believe in to try to solve the myriad problems facing this species (irrespective of individual backgrounds, beliefs, politics, or professions).
But that has created new problems as people have gotten carried away with markets and price and the usual spectres of greed, apathy, ignorance raise their ugly heads with each new step forward.  It comes down to this in the end: there are those that see bitcoin as a business and those that see bitcoin as a transformative tool capable of rewriting the very foundation of those businesses and the socio-economic structures that govern them.  
The former wanna' go full speed ahead without thinking of that bigger picture and that means making decisions that break consensus.  Just look at the bluster of CW et al when he talks of patents and '$20,000 nodes' and completely misses the point of what we're all trying to do here.
And so it always comes down to code in the end, because ultimately ordinary (and extraordinary!) people and companies have to want to USE what we're all building.
As soon as some of the amazing apps being built on LN and Blockstack actually start getting used by the masses, this entire period, like all the other great 'crises' that preceded it, will just become another forgotten hurdle along the way.

That's the thing, we all know how to google, and look through evidence and do objective research.  So I would say first, have you read the whitepaper, seen the discussions already had?
Many of us are actually *coding* as well as dropping into reddit to volunteer our help to this rapidly growing community (there were just 20,000 when I first arrived here).  So, given that I'm coding right now I'll give as much time as I can spare to discuss things, only ask that you come armed with the knowledge above...
A good place to start is Elizabeth Stark's Primer Here:
**"The Importance of Layer Two"**
You can also find a really briliant and active community on the lightning [slack]( who are really open to new members coming in and introducing themselves and will answer many things I won't be able to (since, like you, I'm still learning all this myself and not as knowledgable as I'd like to be in this still nascent tech :) )

It's a shame we have "debates" of any kind; which are just about imposing one set of subjective beliefs over another instead of letting the entire group work it out in a non-confrontational way without seeking to sway the will of the masses to side with an idealogy.  Debates can't be 'won' *or* 'lost', there's too much fuzziness.
The technology is evolving far too quickly for 'sides' and the needs of the entire group (and planet) are way too diverse for any one (or two) brains to hold all the keys.  Therefore diversity in ideas, opinions, values must be embraced across the full spectrum.  
This is why, when there was a rumour that Andreas Antonopolous might be debating Roger, Andreas responded with "I don't see the utility in debates, but thanks for asking me directly instead of spreading rumours Roger." (I am paraphrasing there, couldn't find the exact tweet).
Note that Andreas when he takes the stage, doesn't ordain to know the future or impose his subjective opinions on others.
People need to think for themselves and, if we must listen to anyone, listen to those who DON'T seek to impose subjective viewpoints, deal in rumours, gossip or partake in vicious personality / ad hominem attacks.
"Weak minds talk about other people, average minds talk about events, great minds talk about ideas." — Eleanor Roosevelt 
If we can sear those words into our collective psyche, it becomes far easier to arm ourselves with objective facts, which in turn helps all overcome cognitive dissonance, which, when applied to all the little worlds we each inhabit, allows us to work out how best to deploy that new knowledge to help with expanding our own circles of influence.  
This is about empowering your own communities with the transformative capacity of bitcoin (where you know best what is needed) and letting passionate scientists and engineers get on with the job of building and codifying the actual system behind this (where they know best what is needed). 
We're still building all this together, but [here's a glimpse of the future of fluid democracy]( when we embrace the wisdom of well informed crowds. 
Imagine something like this working for your own community, and we see how we will be far better at solving the many challenges we face as a species **collectively**, rather than putting 'experts' on a stage to tell us all what to [think and feel](
"Everyone is a leader, it's just some of us haven't stepped up yet." — Andreas
If you are able, step up, and trust yourself (you don't need to follow Roger's view, mine or even Andreas') when you are armed with the facts and sheer will and determination to succeed in making YOUR ownworld a better place.
The moon is far, but not far enough ;) 
TL;DR: Trust yourself to trust the ecosystem you are a part of.

Yes I well understand (I was there at the beginning with the Jolly Roger's cookbook on my Amiga and BBS boards in the school library).
Also designer and programmer (learnt around 17 languages since BASIC on the speccy 48k ;) ).  Must have been one of the first kids in the UK to own a mouse (an AMX) and was designing back on the speccy before photoshop existed.  
Have also had to write secure code and do linux/unix admin.  I'm not an 'expert' in any of these disciplines, I just know enough to get computers to do what I need them to do, be that with a paintbrush or the console.
Lighthouse by Mike Hearn is a good example here of how strong code will end up doing nothing without good artists taking that and applying it to real world needs.  Some of those needs the cypherpunks haven't even realised yet, which is why this requires everyone feeling they are an equally important part of the ecosystem.  There can be no "I am a cypherpunk and therefore holier than thou".   
Each of us are on our own paths and applying our unique skills and passions to this grand project, and we each have our part to play.  Roger has been fundamental in taking risks in the real world to carry (and back) those ideas in different communities; Roger, like all of us, just needs to find his niche and avoid treading on people's toes in areas he has limited knowledge.  
As an 80's kid, I also grew up during the punk era and rave movement, loved punk back in the day but adored even more how it could be mixed into dance tracks like John Lydon in Leftfield's Open Up...  Then witnessed how Noel Gallagher from Oasis would be mixed into Chemical Brothers in tracks like Setting Sun... What is it then, if we take a punk or indie track and remix it into dance music?  Is it punk, indie, dance or something else?  Why do we need to label it as anything?  
I dipped in and out of all music genres and have a very eclectic music taste, you would not find me saying "I'm a mettler, I'm a goth, I'm an indie kid."  
I find you can dance to anything if you take the time to listen to what is being said.

I've been thinking about the best way of approaching this.  Would be interesting to start a guerrilla style marketing agency that starts small (a few billboards in select towns) that is not about pushing bitcoin in people's faces, but enriching the towns vibrancy and morale by replacing ads that would otherwise be advancing more consumerism.  
This might be an inspiring daily quote on a screen that brings a smile or a simple, beautiful photograph of people in a local cafe that accepts bitcoin and a small unobtrusive message at the bottom that says "Made possible with Bitcoin." with no call to action or nonsense being pushed in people's faces.  Think the Apple iPhone ads that just feature stunning photography from ordinary iPhone users and you see the route I'm going down here.
Attach an unobtrusive QR code to the bottom of each ad for the marketing 'agency', that allows fellow bitcoiners to pay for the next ad in a 'pay-it-forward' fashion and see it snowball.  
Eventually, locals themselves would be able to beam bitcoins to it to ensure the next billboard slot remains 'ad-free' and submit local photos / art / ideas for what they want to appear there.  With all ads and submissions to be voted for by the r/bitcoin sub and/or local community.  
This works for online too as it would for newspaper full-page ads and the like.  But same rule would apply - no bullshit pushing an agenda or message beyond celebrating how wonderful the world is and stuff.  Perhaps we could start with a stunning image of the moon on the horizon taken by an amateur astronomer and work our way forward from there ;)
**As for how this might work with TV ads...**  
How about just [time lapse Creative Commons imagery]( of the cosmos set to some stunning classical music that runs for the entire 'ad-break' and ends with the "made possible with bitcoin" message.  And that's it.  Just a celebration of art and all the beautiful things humans are capable of.
If you wanna' be classy (and bitcoin *is* classy) that's how we do this the right way :)
I daresay it would bring a tear to Bill Hicks (and Carl Sagan's) eye ;)
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:02:57
I personally feel the only publicity bitcoin needs is honest, grassroots word-of-mouth publicity spread by art, truth and good will.  People need to know what it is, how it may help them, how it is still an experiment and how no-one and no 'expert' outside of science and engineering really have much clue what's going on, and that even the scientists building it will tell you even they can't honestly predict anything; any more than they could predict where the internet would lead.  
Oh, and also that the [price is just a distraction](
But what do I know?  I'm no expert! :D
@_date: 2017-08-31 01:28:53
Wholeheartedly agree, just also recongise that your subjective interpretation of a 'good idea' is not necessarily the same as the person sitting opposite you.  There are no absolutes, only probabilities.  Therefore it does not matter what 'clan' that idea 'belongs' to.  
If you think it's good, go with it, and keep moving; no need to stick a badge on and assume all ideas associated with the group that birthed it are equally good.

@_date: 2017-08-18 22:46:06
Well thanks for reading through my guff and the kind words :) . Here's a bit more!






If we take a step back from it all and marvel at how far we've come in such a short space of time, we will see that every single 'takeover attempt' has failed.  In reality, it matters not to those that built this if the price is $5000 or $5; it's utility and ability to transform the world for the better remains the same.  There are those that grok that and see bitcoin as a way of increasing the freedom of humans across the planet, and there are those that see this as a way of increasing their own material wealth.  
One group is cautious and slow and hyper aware of the massive responsibility that has been placed upon their shoulders, the other group just wanna' go full steam ahead regardless of the consequences (for bitcoin or humanity at large).  One group loves bitcoin and the transformative qualities imbued within it; they work silently behind terminals humbled by their involvement; the other group loves the new found lifestyle and power that comes from being in the spotlight.  They revel in the adrenaline rushes that comes with money, material trappings and 'followers'.
Only one of those groups is cognitively equipped to have the long-term prosperity of the species in mind...  
And so in the end, that is why the only thing that truly matters is the code and the integrity of the people behind that code. 
As a result, those people have already done the hard work of convincing those with real influence in this world that bitcoin is the answer we have all so long been searching for...  Such a grand vision takes time, patience and an unwavering belief in the collective good and ability within all of us to pull this off.  
That's OK, it's taking part in the beautiful journey that really matters, and knowing that one day you get to say to humanities children that you once played a very small part in the greatest socio-technological advance in humankind's history.
The other group?  Well, they're new to this whole power and responsibility thing so they're gonna' break stuff in all the excitement and hubris...  They'll have their fun and games and the other group will fix the things they break...  
Meanwhile, the world gets rebuilt around them regardless of whether they're onboard... and one day, when they wake up from the hangover, they will forget they once opposed the changes they now see around them, just as those that opposed the abolition of slavery, gay marriage, civil rights and all the other incredible advances we have made as a species, forgot they too were once on the wrong side of history.
In other words: Don't Panic.  There's backup plans for backup plans for backup plans.  
As for which of these great two powers you want to see succeed?
Well, that's for you to choose boy ;)

"An invention has to make sense in the world in which it is finished, not the world in which it is started." — Ray Kurzweil
At the moment it's very hard for people to conceptualise a future world where everyone is responsible for their own wealth; or how an economy that *truly* economises based on the actions of billions of truly independent sovereign individuals would function without a hierarchy in charge of such a system.  Same with the p2p consensus based leaderless governance behind it all.
The old world were equally perplexed by the importance of electricity, the printing press, the plough... Until it became self evident they would completely reinvent the way societies were structured.
So too with bitcoin over the next decade as multiple breakthroughs and ideas begin to gain traction with ordinary people... Imagine, for instance, what it means for taxation if individuals contributing to the public purse got to see where every penny went through a transparent public ledger... What if they were able to distribute that economic energy to public good projects and local infrastructure as they see fit, as opposed to trusting unelected representatives in centralised institutions (and all the wasted energy that goes with that)?
What does Web 3.0 look like when billions of micro transactions are powering websites and services instead of advertising?  What happens when bitcoin and federated coins blend into VR and gamer realms?
What will it mean for the world when every single resource can be measured and tracked and the entire supply chain piped through AI on a bitcoin sidechain monitoring their every move?  Same with realestate and property sitting vacant...  We get to see a realtime tradenet emerge as prices meet *actual* supply and demand without intermediaries stepping in creating artificial scarcity and inflating prices.  Conflict minerals and goods with unethical or environmentally costly supply chains are exposed to the network.   Governments and public bodies need to be more mindful of wasteful and fraudulent behaviour.
Just as we couldn't quite imagine what the internet would evolve into back in the days of clunky BBS boards and dialup modems, that world in which bitcoin finishes is still a battleground of ideas.
Fortunately, the younger generations just learning about all this through the myriad universities and online material will have a lot of thoughts on all this by the time they graduate, and I'm quite sure they'll build hitherto unimaginable things that will completely take the world in which bitcoin was invented by storm.
As Andreas Antonopoulos often likes to point out: 
The children of tomorrow will not know of a world where paper fiat currencies exist.  In such a world bitcoin is as 'normal' as social networks, GPS  and smartphones are to today's kids.
That means we're at the very exciting part of the journey here, where we get to build the impossible and tell those future generations we played our part in this beautiful transition :)

And in the beginning, email infrastructure wasn't ready to accommodate 'most people' either.  You needed to know a bit of weird esoteric nerdy stuff like UNIX and, at the beginning, be prepared for your email to potentially get stuck for a week as it got lost being routed.  There were no snazzy point and click email clients.  And yet it was still a joy to use and a complete buzz to be talking and collaborating with people all over the planet you'd never even met.
And we could see why... with time and patience, as the infrastructure matured, the advantages were sooooo great over snail mail that one day the whole of humanity would want to be a part of it all.

The point of bitcoin is to reach a point in time where noone needs to hide anything.  The problem the old system caused was it became impossible to find who was hiding what where which meant good, kind, loving people had to constantly stay one step ahead bending rules.  
Lots of good, loving people fell for your rights to internet freedom just as women, conscientious objectors and civil rights activists did before us.  Like Aaron Swarz, founder of the site you are on / Creative Comments and sooooo much more.
That's all this is about, getting us toward that vision Aaron and others so wanted this world to go in.  I know it's hard to imagine a world without war, fear, poverty and greed but it's now on the horizon...  
Remember it was once impossible to imagine a world of computers (except Ada Lovelace did 200 years ago).  Whilst Charles Babbage is credited with much of the work, it was only Ada that could see where it would all lead and just how transformative they would be. 
She was the first programmer (before computers existed) and foretold nearly all of this.  
There's always been a plan.  And it's absolute chaos :p  But we're figuring it out step by step :)
There's been lots and lots of mistakes but if you're gonna trust anyone in this world, why not let it be those that built computers and then used them to build the internet and declared "information wants to be free!" right at the beginning?
Whilst it is true we are each on different paths, we all share the same goal: a re-united human family capable of reaching the moon and beyond ;)

I guess that depends on whether you think the doctors and social scientists who believe just that are in "their right minds"?  Interesting turn of phrase that btw, were MLK, Steve Jobs, the Wright Brothers, Howard Hughes or even 'Satoshi' in their "right" minds?  
What constitutes a "right" mind?  Those who conform to the normative social influence of their time or those who strive to step outside that narrow thought bandwidth who see from history that the only thing that got us here were those that yearned to grow the species' collective intellect and push our understanding of the universe we inhabit to even greater heights?
In respect to the subject at hand, [Khan Academy]( trials prop up the epigenetic studies.  
Remove competition, exams and rote learning from the syllabus, encourage a culture and environment that allows kids to follow their passions and mentor each other instead of competing and nearly all the kids end up attaining the same level of mastery of subjects they're interested in. 
I am constantly blown away at the amount of self-taught Gen-Z polymaths I see (across all social strata) who have used the internet to absorb everything from psychology and quantum physics to computer science.
This is hardly surprising when we think that platforms like reddit and free online university courses give kids access to a global array of, not only thought 'leaders' in a given subject, but a wide range of peers able to give them help, advice and guidance on whatever subject they happen to be interested in.  
Conflate that with the fact "no-one on the internet knows you are a fridge." and we have also removed discriminatory barriers (age, race, gender, social class, location).  
The authoritative boundaries that used to separate teacher and pupil are now completely blurred (indeed, I have no idea if you are a rich 12 year old kid from Monaco sat on a yacht or a 70 year old retiree from the Bronx; I therefore have no option but to cast any preconceptions aside and engage with you as an equal; I am forced to 'judge' your input solely on your words and the quality of information contained therein).
If you are genuinely interested in *why* this has happened, we need only look to the great polymath Buckminster Fuller, and his seminal work "Operating Manual for a Spaceship Earth".
Of particular interest to us here is the chapter on the Origins of Specialization.
**2. Origins of Specialization**
Obviously we need to pursue further the origins of specialization into deep history, hoping
thereby to correct or eliminate our erroneous concepts. Historically we can say that average
human beings throughout pre-twentieth-century history had each seen only about one-millionth
of the surface of their spherical Earth. This limited experience gave humans a locally-focused,
specialized viewpoint. Not surprisingly, humanity thought the world was flat, and not
surprisingly humans thought its horizontally extended plane went circularly outward to infinity.
In our schools today we still start off the education of our children by giving them planes and
lines that go on, incomprehensibly "forever" toward a meaningless infinity. Such oversimplified
viewpoints are misleading, blinding, and debilitating, because they preclude possible discovery
of the significance of our integrated experiences.
Under these everyday, knowledge-thwarting or limiting circumstances of humanity, the
comprehensively-informed master venturers of history who went to sea soon realized that the
only real competition they had was that of other powerful outlaws who might also know or
hope to learn through experience "what it is all about." I call these sea mastering people the
great outlaws or Great Pirates - the G. P.’s‹ simply because the arbitrary laws enacted or edicted
by men on the land could not be extended effectively to control humans beyond their shores
and out upon the seas. So the world men who lived on the seas were inherently outlaws, and
the only laws that could and did rule them were the natural laws-the physical laws of universe
which when tempestuous were often cruelly devastating. High seas combined with nature’s fog
and night-hidden rocks were uncompromising... **they were the antithesis of specialists. They had high
proficiency in dealing with celestial navigation, the storms, the sea, the men, the ship,
economics, biology, geography, history, and science.** The wider and more long distanced their
anticipatory strategy, the more successful they became.
The Great Pirates said to all their lieutenants around the world, "Any time bright young
people show up, I’d like to know about it, because we need bright men." So each time the
Pirate came into port the local king-ruler would mention that he had some bright, young men
whose capabilities and thinking shone out in the community. The Great Pirate would say to the
king, "All right, you summon them and deal with them as follows: As each young man is
brought forward you say to him, ’Young man, you are very bright. I’m going to assign you to a
great history tutor and in due course if you study well and learn enough I’m going to make you
my Royal Historian, but you’ve got to pass many examinations by both your teacher and
myself.’" And when the next bright boy was brought before him the King was to say, "I’m going
to make you my Royal Treasurer," and so forth. Then the Pirate said to the king, "You will
finally say to all of them: But each of you must mind your own business or off go your heads.
I’m the only one who minds everybody’s business.’ "
And this is the way schools began as the royal tutorial schools. You realize, I hope, that I am
not being facetious. That is it. **This is the beginning of schools and colleges and the beginning
of intellectual specialization.** Of course, it took great wealth to start schools, to have great
teachers, and to house, clothe, feed, and cultivate both teachers and students. Only the GreatPirate-protected
robber-barons and the Pirate-protected and secret intelligence-exploited
international religious organizations could afford such scholarship investment. And the
development of the bright ones into specialists gave the king very great brain power, and made
him and his kingdom the most powerful in the land and thus, secretly and greatly, advantaged
his patron Pirate in the world competition with the other Great Pirates.
But **specialization is in fact only a fancy form of slavery wherein the "expert" is fooled into
accepting his slavery by making him feel that in return he is in a socially and culturally
preferred, ergo, highly secure, lifelong position.**
Not only does that lead us to the obvious truth that the only real currency of value in this world is information, but it also begs a question:  "Are today's 'Great Pirates' those who have mastered the art of navigating and extracting information in the vast uncharted digital oceans of the internet?"
Food for thought.

IMO, internet generation did realise this and the power being taken back is around for all to see (from Panama leaks to Bitcoin and Silkroad, we are tending toward a beautiful stalemate that favours those who seek to free information, borders and control...).  The evolution was inevitable the moment the internet first sparked unfettered information into the ungoverned territory of cyberspace... As soon as the answer to a child saying "Mom, why is the sky blue?" went from "Ask your Dad" (Dad makes up erroneous answer) to "Ask Google", humanity began to collectively take its first tentative steps towards a Type I civilisation.  
A newly empowered, global citizenry, each with a supercomputer in her pocket represents a newly enlightened humanity with no single point of failure, minds free to roam and dream, uncluttered by lies, bias and the need to exploit others.
As we step, collectively towards this new light with the swipe of a finger, the push of a message that can reach the other side of the world in a millisecond, we overcome the illusion of borders, fear and control that has kept us from boldly going where no previous generation dreamt possible.
As we do so, the voting booth (and with it, idealogical tribalism) will seem as archaic as the old telephone boxes we see decaying on street corners.
Powering up for complete system reboot...  Moon, Mars and Alpha Centauri await this newly confident interconnected species that will emerge from the ashes.  We will barely recognise ourselves, these dark ages and dim and distant to the species that allowed abject slavery and subjugation of women... And as sure as we ask our Grandmothers what segregation of blacks and whites was like in the 60's these children of the stars being born today, will one day ask with the same incredulous wonder  "Google, what were voting booths for?"

That's not how the majority of VCs work.  They don't say "hey is this innovating?".  They say "can this make money?".
The *only* reason we have automated cars is because Google chucked billions at the idea just because they thought there might be an outside chance it could be done.  There was no business plan, no idea if they could ever make money from doing it.  
They are about the only company on the planet capable of doing that, just for the pure love of pushing the human race forward.
But they are rare... The rest of the VC game is nothing but a casino with the principle aim of increasing numbers in a ledger... and it's time we all lifted the wizards curtain on that, and got on with the more important mission of getting humanity into the stars.

Of course this is what Blockbuster execs said about streaming internet video.
This doesn't just impact lawyers but *any* profession that doesn't require a large degree of creativity (such as accounting).
It's not only bitcoin and smart contracts disrupting all this, but expert systems powered by AI that are able to do much of the grunt work.  Law is, afterall, just code.
The idea that we had to pay hefty sums to legal middlemen to deal with, say, the simple contractual agreement between two parties consenting to the sale of a house, is going to look ridiculous soon enough.
On top of the high end technology disruption, you have crowd based legal services that cut out the need for a law firm entirely, enabling lawyers to freelance and work from their laptop anywhere in the world, much like a programmer might.
See Raad Ahmed's [Lawtrades]( backed by bitcoin entrepreneur Tim Draper for a recent example of startups that are already making that a reality.
Perhaps in the future, there will be multiple online hearings that, rather than relying on the particular subjective whims of a judge or jury picked at random, will instead see cases heard and decided upon via a multitude of experts checking in online and conversing with large crowd based juries.
With a combination of the crowd and AI making for fairer assessments, perhaps things like [ego depletion]( (which makes a mockery of the current system) will never be a factor.  Assuming those online crowd based jurors have eaten of course :p

What people forget as they get worked up over price charts and 'free market' mechanics and lost in the champagne fueled company after parties... is that **the only thing that matters is the code.**
People also forget that, aside from Microsoft (who have sided with core) absolutely no tech giants have yet come out to reveal their bitcoin plans.  Do you not find it odd that even though Google hard-coded the word bitcoin into the Google Trends dropdown years ago they have so far remained silent about bitcoin?  Odd too that twitter and facebook have been paying bitcoin to ex "hackers gone good" for security penetration.  Odd too that FB execs have come out [talking about the amazing potential of bitcoin]( but still no roll-out announcements...
Odd, until you understand all that matters is the code...  
Most have been waiting for Segwit so they can get to grips with Lightning and Blockstack (essentially the http:// of bitcoin).  And by most, I include people like Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the world wide web) who [tweeted out his Blockstack ID]( about a year ago.
So when those that actually built the internet and the companies that define it figure out the best way to play with all this, what do you think will become of all the young pretenders in this space who have had the audacity to think they know how the internet works better than its *actual* architects?  
And which companies and individuals in this space will those tech giants most likely want to work with?  The patient, gentle ones who see this as a technology capable of changing the world for the better, or those that used nefarious underhand tactics to use bitcoin as a battering ram to drive short term (and shortsighted) profit gains?
In the meantime, those that haven't the patience to learn that "with great power comes great responsibility" have a nice little sandpit to blow off steam.

Seems all major websites have had to commit a bit of 'evil' to get along in this world simply because the internet was NEVER supposed to be powered by advertising.  The original W3C drafts include a response error "Payment Required." which would have allowed micropayments between sites.

I think it's time journalists quit and went back to life school to think about whatever it was why they were thinking about before someone told them they need to go write a bunch of stuff about things they're not really passionate about in order to 'earn' a living competing against other writers writing about stuff they're not really passionate about in order to 'earn' a living.
Looking forward to the great exodus; where they all buy half a bitcoin, a guitar and a rucksack; then go travel the world and write about their experiences of actually enjoying their living (courtesy of them no longer needing to 'earn their living' due to this new 'geek gold' stuff).

Analysts and old world investors fail to recognise that some of the biggest names in tech (Reddit, Steam, Overstock, Dell, Twitter, Microsoft to name but a few) have been accepting and/or stockpiling bitcoin for years and care very little about the price.  
On top of that there is now an entire new class of worker whose salaries are being partly paid in bitcoin by tech firms.  Even ['hackers gone good']( have been picking up bitcoin bug bounties from tech giants for many years. 
Likewise, silicon valley legends like Chamath Palihapitiya and Paul Graham have been involved since the very early days too.  Heck, even good ol' Wozniak got in on the bitcoin train as did Andresen Horowitz and Techcrunch founder Michael Arrington, who recently launched nexo.io.
When you have so many wealthy connected tech people invested in *the idea* and not price, those that think bitcoin price is going to act like any other 'stock' are living in cloud cuckoo land.
Bitcoin is not a stock and paid analysts working 5 day weeks peddling it as such, will soon find they are way out of their depth... as we're seeing this year with all the price predictions that have been constantly wrong.  It's almost as if those tech stalwarts have been trolling the "fast money" crowd simply because they can.  Afterall, they have better technology, better coders, better understanding and insights into *their* industry, better information networks open 24/7, better trading bots and analysis tools and yes, even better *actual* analysts.
In the end, all this only leads to yet further erosion of faith and belief in those old world clerics working with that ailing tech infrastructure that bought in the 2008 crisis...  As politicians and ordinary people begin to wake up en masse, it's fair to say we are witnessing the era of the passing of their greed... and the moral arc of this universe is finally bending towards the scientists that are now guiding this good spaceship earth.
The only true power in this world has always been information and that old paperbelt world of Wall Street and zero sum speculative games is now fully ensconced in Plato's Cave... chasing their own shadows as those outside with access to realtime trustworthy information streams, build all this via wide open collaborative networks of trusted individuals who have always believed in that whole 'do the right thing' ethic.
It is not old world *analysts* but scientists and techies who now have greatest access (and fastest route) to the most truth in this space and, therefore, the best information.  Ergo, it's no longer about 'who you know', but 'what you know'.
Those operating from those information deprived caves who fail to fully grok this are, I feel, suffering from the [Dunning Kruger effect](
 and more than a little [Illusion of Control]( whilst everyone else works on this beautiful thing via trusted networks that have been together for nearly a decade... building in the plain light of day, safe in the knowledge that no matter how much the old world scratches its head - the new world has already succeeded in touching the hearts and minds of the only people that matter in the end — the ordinary end users of this incredible technology.

**Bitcoin Helps Venezuelan Families Avoid Starvation** 
If you want to buy coffee right now with bitcoin then you have options like getting yourself a bitcoin debit card.  In the meantime you have to accept that bitcoin has grown to the point where it needs off-chain scaling solutions to best cope with the increasing demand.
But don't take my word for it, here's Facebook Executive tech 'expert' Chamath Palihapitiya explaining this much better than I can.
  
"I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fun, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. **Because what you're talking about right now is, for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right?** The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? **I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government.** It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. **Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina.** Everywhere you have currency pressure. Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. And then, **after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism.**" — Chamath

Of course there was a time when the job of the men in the tribe was to go out and kill animals for dinner, and where going over to the neighboring tribe and murdering people for fun was just part of day to day life.  
There was a time when burning witches at the stake, beheading 'undesirables' and putting their head on a stake as a deterrent, child slavery, making human sacrifices to the gods and hanging people in the town square was just an average Sunday afternoon stroll in the park of civilized village life.
There is no such thing as the concept of 'humans being human' when we're constantly evolving what it means *to be* human.  To future technologically advanced humans living in a world of abundant diversity, the idea we once needed guns, prisons and law courts to keep society in check will be as alien to them as that horrifically violent backward old world I described above is to us.

Nearly the exact same "V for Vendetta" crowd stuck two fingers up to Satoshi too when Satoshi urged against supporting Wikileaks in the early days...  Funny how the importance of following consensus rules overriding "Satoshi's vision" on Wikileaks mattered then, but not so much later on...
Well... Now they've all had a lot of fun with their endless YouTube debates, Twitter spats and first experiences of what it means to wield influence on the internet.  The next stage will be the realisation that bitcoin (and bitcoiners) are not a play thing to be toyed with, and with all that influence comes great responsibility.

IIRC Charlie said that he could have fought to stay had he re-applied and shown he was not a 'socialist', but he chose not to out of principle.  
He loathed what had happened to America during that period after having vocalised his political views in a movie called Monsieur Verdoux, where he attacked capitalism saying it lead to mass killing through wars and weapons of mass destruction.
[This from Wikipedia](
[After a 1952 London film premiere] attorney general James P. McGranery revoked Chaplin's re-entry permit and stated that he would have to submit to an interview concerning his political views and moral behaviour in order to re-enter the US. 
Although McGranery told the press that he had "a pretty good case against Chaplin", Maland has concluded, on the basis of the FBI files that were released in the 1980s, that the US government **had no real evidence to prevent Chaplin's re-entry. It is likely that he would have gained entry if he had applied for it.** However, when Chaplin received a cablegram informing him of the news, he privately decided to cut his ties with the United States:
"Whether I re-entered that unhappy country or not was of little consequence to me. I would like to have told them that the sooner I was rid of that hate-beleaguered atmosphere the better, that I was fed up of America's insults and moral pomposity..." — Charlie

Yeah but only the ultra paranoid ones, by now we're living in a world where there is no 'big brother' since the system is trustless and governed by the crowd.
We already have this (to a degree) in the UK, the most CCTV'd nation on the planet.  That used to be something that troubled me until I realised the laws that govern their use (data protection laws) enable every citizen to request the footage and that, actually, it was there just as much to watch over the watchmen (I know of two activist friends who were basically assaulted by cops that had panicked for no reason and CCTV was used to prove the cops were at fault).  
Police complaints in America go down by a huge percentage when cops are fitted with bodycams and in the UK it's legal for civilians to film the cops with smartphones...  All this leads to calmer policing, to the point where it's likely the entire security and policing (and indeed intelligence) apparatus of the future will itself get decentralised and carried out by the global crowd.  
**But here's the super cool direction I see this going...**
We end up in a real interesting situation – since no-one has anything to gain from breaking the societal codes we've all consented to in a given region, we have no reason to obscure our online or real world identities, to the point where something like the facebook 'friends nearby' feature will be enabled on our devices at all times, showing a global and local map of everyone you know, where they are and what they're doing...  
Rather than having to arrange meetings and stick to timetables and schedules we create a much more fluid society where serendipitous events are engineered based on the time and place groups of people just happen to be by random chance.  Fancy listening to a blues musician after dinner?  Oh look, according to the people nearby app, there's one just down the road available to come over and play for us, I just need to tip her a few millibits if I like the music...  This is what uber, airbnb, couchsurfing, dating sites already do of course (turns out we can trust strangers if the system incentivises good behaviour of participants).
The [tyranny of the clock]( that George Woodcock so lamented that governs our modern day world becomes as alien to this new fluid generation, as the age before the invention of clocks is to ours.   
That is all made possible when we each have an encrypted data layer that allows us to trust one another within the global village based on the amount of 'digital karma' we accrue in day to day life.  Karma that can, of course, be converted into digital economic value leading to increased social capital via sidechain initiatives on bitcoin.

Those who did best out of Amazon stocks in the dotcom years simply held through all the internet FUD and panic.
If you're here for the longterm, now is the time to go outside and enjoy the summer months - talk about Bitcoin, spread it around to those who are curious but remember life is to be lived and money/bitcoin should not be the reason you get up of a morning.  
Long-term health of Bitcoin has never looked so bright, so there's little point wasting your life away staring at numbers on a screen, reading posts about price or dreaming of the things you might do tomorrow when those numbers go up.
TL;DR: Stop looking at prices... Enjoy the summer... Bitcoin will still be here when you get back.

It's the ecosystem working within the rules it set (and it all goes back to being powered by advertisers which brave browser just fixed).  As with every environment the individual feels they wish to escape, they can: either via joining closed and secret groups or using the tools Facebook provides to curate your friends updates by clicking unfollow.  
They can even leave and go to Google+ or Russia's VK.com.  We all have a choice and a responsibility to leave our comfort zone if it want to make things better...
P.S. thanks for the link but having been in Bitcoin so long and seeing how much MSM gets technology wrong, i pay practically zero attention to it.  That said, Telegraph isn't bad for some of the things it specialises in (they source stuff pretty well I think); I prefer Guardian for tech stuff because of links to Cory Doctorow / Glenn Greenwald  / Ed Snowden and their Guardian OpenPlatform, but even they have to bend to advertisers and are broken in the exact same way many things on the web and, indeed, modern urban sprawls are. 
And yet we all make the most out of it and create beautiful things anyway (where would we be without FB Event invites and diary updates eh?).  It's only the people and groups that really matter. 
Wikitribune / Brave are all set to change this and [Guardian's OpenPlatform]( will no doubt play a big role in the future (as it already has).  
Ultimately, those sites that make it through this next wave of disruption will do so because the founders and users loved them enough and that is often those companies that cared more about the [WHY]( than profit incentive.  
We've all had to do things in this world we're not proud of, and whilst the internet will never forget, it can forgive.

It doesn't matter if we agree, all that matters is we keep moving forward.  Trust the ecosystem to figure it out.  And trust the great wise elders (of all ages!) and scientists (of all disciplines!) have our back.

I feel like Bitcoin is now at the same stage Coldplay were at when Chris Martin announced to a nonplussed Glastonbury audience: "We're called Coldplay... none of you have heard of us yet, but [the song we're about to play]( will be number one next week."
About the only people in the audience who had heard of them prior to that were the nerds who had downloaded their EP off Napster (noone in the audience knew what Napster was back then either).
So... prepare to be one of those people who reminisces about how you were into bitcoin wayyyyyyy before it became cool 8)

Indeed, we tend to overestimate how far we will move forward in a year, but underestimate where we will be in ten.
Of course, as the rate of free information exchange accelerates through digital networks we get ever closer to the technological singularity Ray Kurzweil predicted.
By then we may well end up thinking more in terms of months than the years that hold old world analog hierarchical institutions back.

Sure.  Email providers and mobile phone operating systems (like android) can instantiate  code that requires those sending mass communications pay a small charge for the privilege which will only be refunded if receivers  of those communications (who have legit blockstack credentials) haven't flagged them as spam.  You therefore make it prohibitively expensive for spammers to operate meaning only companies acting in good faith with positive user feedback get oxygen.

It's that whole "Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach a Man To Fish, and You Feed Him for a Lifetime"... People don't need handouts as such (if that's all it took then foreign aid would have already succeeded)... Rather, ordinary people need the tools and basic education on how to bootstrap all this themselves.  You need to get this into the hands of the right people if you don't wanna' just empower those that will further exploit the vulnerable.  That means enabling maker economies and the like.

Part of the moderation problem, I think, is the tools being used no longer being fit for purpose for a community and project of this scale... especially when you're being hit by a barrage of non-technical people trying to weigh in on (very) technical debates that even the brightest techies in this space have trouble wrapping their heads around.
There really should have been an entirely separate sub (platform even?) for technical issues regarding scaling and code functionality; one much more accessible than github / dev mailing lists that the 'business' crowd could voice concerns without legions of 'followers' railroading discussions.
I am reminded of Carl Sagan's line "We exist in a world exquisitely dependent on science and technology where hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology."  That's where bitcoin is right now...
Under these conditions you can hardly blame mods for feeling the need to 'batten down the hatches' and retreat from the mob.
There are over 1/4 million readers in here now and only so much mods can do...
So we need to build a better platform for figuring all this out.  
We could, with all the brains we have in here, and years worth of reddit data, begin pulling together a whole range of stats on users (age of account; r/btc r/bitcoin post weighting; overall reddit karma level by sub; bitcointalk presence; twitter handles; blockstack ID etc.)...  
We could then cross-reference users and run posts through toxicity and sentiment analysis filters using API's such as Perspective: 
It would take a bit of effort to code, sure, but long term, aren't we wasting far more effort in fighting a never ending stream of FUD?

I first integrated bitcoin on a non profit website very early 2012.  Prior to that was following and learning about the space through various social activist and techie circles and was aware of it from the beginning through the likes of hackernews.  
I am a nerd; spent a good part of my early adulthood in IRC and newsgroups... Before that was networking school computers and was part of the first generation of early cybernauts messing around with BBS boards and was actively involved in the Amiga demoscene in my  teens.
Transformative tech like Bitcoin has been a lifelong passion of mine, and many of us have been dreaming of these days for decades.  Some of us have been fortunate enough to be able to forego the office space and travel the world with a laptop.  In doing so, you realise how "same, same, but different" (as they say in Asia) everyone is ;)
The penny on bitcoin didn't finally drop until I properly took 6 months off coding work to research and fully digest the implications of the whitepaper in early 2013.  I shall never forget the moment it finally 'clicked' since l found myself moved to tears by it all.  Needless to say, there was no going back once I realised how far the rabbit hole goes.
Have been working on bitcoin full-time ever since, through the hard times and the good :p

So when Microsoft and others that know technology inside out say they only trust bitcoin for its truly decentralised properties... Are all the young pretenders on the scene saying those computer scientists at Microsoft and the very people that contributed to the core technology... know nothing compared to a few VC backed blockchain startups that forked the bitcoin code, made a few hacks through a centralised team to tackle some esoteric use case... Use cases that are *already* being solved more elegantly on bitcoin via layer 2 tech?  
Might I also add, that nearly all alt blockchains will be up against the exact same scaling issues Bitcoin faced should their ideas actually take off and gain any significant traction.  
Meaning their only way out would be to make it compatible with layer 2.  Which begs the question "why not use the more decentralised chain, with a proven 9 year track record of impeccable peer reviewed due diligence and code management that has proven resistant to censorship and all external pressures...  And is always going to be the chain layer 2 tech teams focuses on developing for?".  
Heck, most alts don't even have adequate 51% attack protection in place.
You see the issues there?  
People got caught up on the little details and got all over excited about the technology and quick and dirty hacks, and missed seeing the wood for the trees.
Seems to me many, many people in this space have been punked by a small group of wise old neckbeards and slumbering tech giants who have been quietly waiting and watching, having seen all this happen before during the dotcom frenzy.

The bitcoin blockchain is *very* public by design.  Whilst a degree of pseudonymity is afforded, it is infinitely easier to trace a Bitcoin address to its owner than, say, a truly anonymous cash transaction.  
Were it not, it's unlikely Bitcoin would have gotten this far, given all the FUD we've had to fight over the years due to the pseudo anonymity it gives to participants.

Except the fact that 9 out of 10 projects funded by VC's fail, tells us it doesn't work very well at all.  Especially when it's not 'cost effective' to cure an illness or make the best possible product (i.e forced obsolescence).
So... Yes... we have to remove that Gordon Geckoesque 'greed is good' brain damage too if we are going to move to a Type I civilisation.  
And we *are* going to get there, because we're all tired of the secrets, lies and ignorance that have been powering the military industrial complex when it is a fact that we live in a world of abundance with enough to go around for everyone.  We do not need to be working 9-5 any longer.
The new driver of innovation then, need only be "Can it be done?  Have the crowd done the due diligence?  Do we have consensus to do it?"
I think we'll be pleasantly surprised by just what progress we are all capable of making when we stop asking for permission to do the right thing from gatekeepers who are only concerned with personal gain and filling in imaginary numbers on a revenue forecast sheet.
Like it or not, just as history passed the baton of 'power' from the industrialists to the capitalists, this new information era is seeing that baton move from the capitalists to the scientists.

Why do we feel the need to put a price tag on everything?  
We are the only species on planet earth that has consented to a reality where we think we have to pay to live here and yet the obvious truth beyond the glare of consumerism culture is that we live in a world of abundance; the good earth does not charge us a penny to produce food or water and we have more than enough shelter and land to go around for everyone.  Those unused resources we see everywhere (shops, houses and office blocks empty or abandoned because of a system of property price speculation; warehouses full of rice and medical goods left to rot because of futures contracts that deem it unprofitable to be moved whilst those that grew and harvested the resources to make those goods go starving; an obesity (read: greed) epidemic in the West where a third of their food is thrown out whilst a third of the world live close to starvation). 
If those crimes against humanity that this system has duped humanity into thinking is 'normal' is unseen to you, then by all means carry on your merry way.  But know that many of us who got into bitcoin in the very early days, did so because we see it as a way out from that madness.

Can't really say, neither groups holding fiat/btc have had a thorough audit and so there's no transparency.  What I would say is, given the underhand tactics we're seeing from Jeff and closed door deals happening, it just seems like big business as usual.  Any 'trust' therefore is more of a 'hope'.  
Ultimately, I'd rather whatever company ran such a tethering service did it with the kind of commitment others in this space have made to being open and transparent with all the participants.

Funnily enough, this is exactly why the consensus process was built for the governance of bitcoin, i.e. so that those who might otherwise be overpowered by noisy and/or powerful personalities would be given an equal share of voice regardless of their background or status.
That equal share of voice *does not* mean you get to talk to your fellow humans like they're a piece of shit if you expect your opinions and ideas to be truly listened to and valued by others.

LN potential is clear if you take the time to research and fully understand its implications.  Bear in mind this is what we were saying to financial incumbents since the beginning about bitcoin's potential (which required stepping away from what you thought you knew about economics and looking at the world differently, which in turn meant LOTS of reading).
Same is true of LN, most bitcoiner's can empathise with the above given the gargantuan amounts of research and reading we've all done over the years.
I personally have about 20 papers that now need complete revision because of the implications of Layer 2.  I'm not upset by that, because those projects required all kinds of dirty centralised hacks to pull off with vanilla bitcoin and have been sat gathering dust on my google drive for some 2 years as we awaited segwit.  
I realise not everyone is on the technical side (that's OK we couldn't be here without everyone's diverse skillsets contributing)...  And there is plenty fun stuff to be done around here onboarding newbies with the broader concepts you are all familiar with, before speculating about LN potential.
Let's all be a little patient here and place trust in the scientists and educators who have gotten this tech to where we are today.  It's not the destination here that matters (since it will always be moving), it's the journey and fun we have along the way.
Here's some handy LN primers for those keen to learn more...  For me it's taken multiple viewings / reading of the material for things to start sinking in... Just as it did with bitcoin all those years ago ;)

You bring up some great points.  Bitcoin's strength is in the diversity of thought and opinion of those that make up the community.  That goes for devs too, who often disagree on things.  They're keenly aware, I think, that they are there to serve the community - not the other way around - and, whilst the community has forced the tech to go in some very dubious directions at times (leading to people like Mike Hearn rage quitting) I think, ultimately this entire journey has been about "how can we get a rag tag group of rebels and misfits - all with different ideas on how the world should work -  pulling in the same direction... without sacrificing their individuality or appointing 'leaders' tasked with controlling them?"
The answer is concensus based decision making and constant refining (and redefining) of what bitcoin *is*.  Like those who figure out life itself need not have a finish line, knowing there can be no 'outright victory' for bitcoin makes for a very interesting project with no definable end state.
From the outside that looks like complete chaos, but then so does Delhi when you jump into your first tuk tuk and hold on for dear life :p yet somehow it all just *works* and is all the more colourful for the chaos.
We cannot, however, thrive on that chaos alone when so many people whose livelihoods have been defined by order are being disrupted by all this.  Some people are not yet ready to start expending the extra energy it takes to start thinking for themselves or living life outside of an office block and regimented schedules and well defined hierarchical boundaries that come with that familiar territory.
Ethereum and their carefully polished presentations, nicely registered Swiss foundation, lead by people who turn up in suits (on time!) to gently explain all this to other suits who will move old world money into 9-5 job creation around this tech, *is* necessary.  That is, afterall, why bitcoiners funded them is it not?  That, and the fact Vitalik is a genius and the idea of a world computer is *awesome* and appealed to all bitcoiners.  
The complex mathematical discussions, talks of ROI and serious nature appealed less so, which meant bitcoiners mostly stayed here and let them do their own thing.  I have been to precisely one ethereum meet (the launch) and lasted 5 minutes in the Daohub, which looked like a meeting of venture capitalists monthly.  To invest intellectual energy in there *and* bitcoin was a stretch too far.  
Naturally all this meant there were fewer people that understood the core technology over in ethereum than in bitcoin, so a few people like Vitalik and Gavin Wood had to take charge of the suits and get rich quick schemers that descended on the space.  That's changing now, largely *because* of the professional manner inwhich Vitalik and others have run the show.
On the other end of the spectrum of all that is humanity, we have paranoid 'kek' type 'preppers' of the 'V for Vendetta's a persuasion who have been bought up on Alex Jones and the like... They will naturally gravitate to different authority figures to channel all their anger and resentment of the old institutions that have let us all down into something more productive (and perhaps reverse some of the damage all the fake news has done to warp minds).  In comes the libertarians, anarco capitalists and voluntaryists to save the day as  colourful characters like CSW get added to the circus show that is crypto...  That's ok too.  Not everyone is good at critical thinking and those who have been here longest often forget the steep learning curve we ourselves had to traverse before all this made sense.  
Yet another spectrum: Environmentally obsessed liberals reading nonsensical articles in MSM who think bitcoiners are all lunatics about to turn the world into a giant heatsink for their crypto miners... They too need to find things like carbon coin to feel they're channeling their ideas into something productive.
So... I say let them figure it all out in their own time like we had to.  We too were all just as angry at the beginning of this during the 2008 crisis that lead to us coming together here.  
Have empathy for those who have only just come into the space and feel exactly as we once did.
Zoom out on that entire space... and the entire altcoin ecosystem begins to look a lot like the chaos and diversity that gives bitcoin its strength.  The only difference is, bitcoiners have worked out how to put idealogically differences to one side and enjoy each others diversity, without all feeling the need to hum along to the same tune.
We can therefore trust that the ecosystem itself will eventually figure out the optimal paths - just like the mess of websites at the beginning of the worldwide web began to figure itself out after things like Google came along to filter out the noise.

I have no idols; I've met Andreas a few times, I love and respect him as a human being, and one of the few that understand the *why* of Bitcoin and the complex socio-economic issues it was built to address.  Like myself, he's traveled to over 60 countries on this planet, all with a lot of different systems but far more similarities than differences.  This kind of travel itself broadens the mind in ways those stuck in office blocks are yet to understand.
But he's not always right about everything - none of us have been or can be - since there's the whole chaos thing that needs to be embraced and way too many variables in play.  The key is separating information from the personality giving it, and taking it onboard with skepticism before allowing it to inform your worldview.  
He has been right way more times than he has been wrong, he speaks from the heart and has nothing to sell.  For that, and his high level technical understanding, the fact he wrote *the* book on bitcoin and, like myself has dedicated the last 6 years of his life to this even when times were tough - means he gets my ear and my respect.
I have far less respect for computer scientists that don't understand why blockchain is nothing more than an append only database and a silly little buzzword on a par with dotcom.
In the end, I'm not going to tell you what to think and feel; I have no more ability to tell you the future than you do me.  
I'll leave you with something Satoshi once wrote: "If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry."
Back when Satoshi wrote that, there weren't many places you could go beyond bitcointalk forum threads to learn about the technology.  
But today people don't have that excuse for remaining in the dark.  There's enough quality information and people out there sticking to science, facts and truth for you to filter the noise.  Read, research, and learn some basic critical thinking skills so you might form your own opinions.  Then figure out what you want the future to look like.  Then roll your sleeves up and get involved; doesn't matter if the future doesn't go the way you expect or want, what counts is making friends along the way and going to bed at night feeling you've put more into the world than you took out of it.
In the end... It's up to you to start thinking for yourself and not worry about what I (or even Andreas) think the future ought look like.

How do you define equal in a world of abundance?  What measurement tool are you using if people no longer value material possessions, status or money but care more about creation, learning, exploring and making real human connections, stories and experiences?
Literally every bullet point you've made, is absolutely fine.  This is not about turning people into the Borg but allowing everyone in all their uniqueness to be able to express themselves freely whilst ensuring the basic needs of the entire species are met.  Noone would be forced to turn over their material possessions any more than people are forced to put their properties on airbnb in today's world...  It's just their possessions would hold little 'value' (which is entirely subjective anyhow) to the vast majority of those that are no longer motivated by the accumulation of material objects. 
This is not about forcing people to think and feel the same.  Quite the contrary, it's about appreciating the many different passions, skills and knowledge we all have whilst ensuring noone is forced into work or study if they have no natural interest in partaking in those things. 
We treat each other as equals because we all *are* equal and vitally important participants in the human story.
Just as I'm treating you here on Reddit as an equal even though I know absolutely nothing about you other than you're a fellow human being trying to make the same sense as this thing we call life as the other 7 billion out there.
It is the exact antithesis to forcing people to ascribe to the kinds of tribalistic brainwashing we see in today's systems where people are taught to think and act the same and operate under the erroneous assumptions that their class, status or station of birth somehow makes them *more* equal than others.  They do not.
I, as a computer scientist, recognise that a mechanic, a nurse, a pianist are just as important to a healthy, vibrant, diverse society as I am.  And that my having a higher IQ than that mechanic does not make me 'better' than him, any more than his bigger abs make him 'better' than I.  If my car broke down, I'd need his help; if his PC breaks down, he'd need mine.
Of course the good news is, since none of the future I and others are predicting would be forced... for those who don't want to partake in a collaborative resource based economy, I'm quite sure there may well be a number of gated communities that will fence themselves off and continue to live in that old zero sum dog-eat-dog world.  Just as there are currently vast swathes of laggards in the West who refuse to use smartphones, the internet, airbnb or lyft.
If you've ever seen the movie [the village]( I'm guessing those gated communities would look a lot like that, only with more tinfoil hats :p

We have to accept that when we have abandoned shipping containers strewn around the world with millions of unsold over produced useless things like beanie babies, whilst warehouses full of perfectly edible food and medical supplies rot away... and the people who desperately need that aid and grew and cultivated the very food rotting away - sit next to those warehouses with distended stomachs, subjugated and starving - because somebody **gambled on the future price** of those goods and it was deemed 'unprofitable' to put them to use... all whilst greed has reached such levels in the West obesity is now one of the biggest killers - then it is clear **something is very, very wrong with the world** and those people we are allowing to govern over a system that continues to allow those crimes against humanity to happen, need to hand things over to a new generation of scientists and nurturers capable of reversing the damage they have caused.
People in that racket will of course feel affronted by this, they will say "but I'm just doing my job" as they press those Bloomberg terminal buttons... in the exact same way those SS soldiers (who would also fail the Milgram experiment) would be just "doing their job" as they pressed the gas release buttons in those shower blocks.
By the time the obvious truth is realised by the many that the entire economy is built on a cult of casino gamblers following the 'orders' of addicts peddling bad mathematics and pseudo science, whilst suffering mass psychosis and delusions of grandeur... An entirely new collaborative digital economy will have been built in plain sight on the internet by people who understand the future of the species cannot be safeguarded by those people playing zero sum games, whose actions are contributing to human misery and inequity of wealth, the likes of which we've never seen before.
Now, more than ever, we need remarkable people to take responsibility and use this technology we're all so in love with to fix the rot at the heart of all this.  That requires complete systemic change and a new way of looking at things.
It's worth remembering that was the very reason bitcoin was created.  It is *not* a speculative vehicle to continue the same business as usual.  Those treating it as such, will need to take a long hard look in the mirror when all this begins to make sense and ask which side of history they want to tell future generations they stood on.

What you have is a group of pro-chaos 'Alex Jones' prepper types newly galvanized by the alt-right in America, who are very very angry and scared of the world, who like to watch things burn.  They get their kicks out of schadenfreude and the adrenaline rushes that come with making others angry.
Roger et al have taken advantage and encouraged this ignorance and fear and very few can see the manipulation going on (things like 110% mining rewards, sock puppet accounts and a barrage of paid-for misinformation campaigns).  I doubt Roger himself sees the damage that is done by using dark magic tricks like this to buy your way into people's consciousness.  He and his cronies (CW, Matonis) are from the old skool Geckoesque "business has to be ruthless" stable, and completely out of their depth in the collaborative "information wants to be free" world that built the internet.
“Monsters exist, but they are too few in number to be truly dangerous. More dangerous are the common men, the functionaries ready to believe and to act without asking questions.” ― Primo Levi
This means many of the people there have been callously preyed upon for "business-as-usual" profit in the exact same way Alex Jones profits from the fear he creates.  The toxic, paranoid subculture that results is one that sees everything as a fight where everybody is out to get them.  They are the very same people who in the beginning believed Alex et al when he claimed bitcoin was an "illuminati" ploy to create a one world govcoin etc.  When you believe everything is a fight for survival then the very worst of humanity comes out.   
Living in such a warped subjective reality means they assume others (companies like blockstream) operate with the same set of "dog-eat-dog" standards and the same (broken) moral compass.  Whereas the actual truth is, some people (and companies) are just nice and want the whole world to get along.
As MLK said, the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice.
Those with truth on their side, who operate in the light and have nothing to fear, will eventually prevail.  Just as we prevailed against the last group of naysayers ignorant of the technology.

50% of Americans are not even close to being 50% of ordinary *people* that the global currency of bitcoin has been built to serve.  In the UK, for example, that number is [closer to 10%]( (declining from around 20% in the mid 90s).  In Africa, closer to zero.  
Even in America, if we narrow those numbers down into different demographics we see a much less egalitarian picture.  [The richest 10% now own 84% of all stocks.](
Further demographic analysis shows millennials comprise only a small percentage of those that own stock and that general ownership is highly concentrated among households that:
- Are white, non-Hispanic
- Are headed by someone with at least a four-year college degree
- Had a parent with at least a four-year degree
- Are middle-aged or older
[Source — St. Louis Fed](
Which means the entire backbone of that system is suffering from acute levels of 'brain drain', reliant as it is on a social strata that is highly ignorant of modern technology and the global, borderless world the internet has engendered.


That's absolutely fine, just as long as people in here don't expect gamblers with weak hands who only loosely understand the 'stock' they're investing in to come to the 'rescue' of bitcoin in the longer-term.  
If they truly cared about the borderless, censorship-resistant, decentralised *technology*, they'd put in a few days work to find out what it is they're 'investing' in and realise "not their keys, not their bitcoin".   Which would negate the need for their ETF involvement in the first place.
Ironically, as this next decade plays out, it is looking increasingly likely that it will be those who needed bitcoin most and took the time and effort to understand the *why* of this technology, that will be coming to the rescue of those that gambled on it as if it were any other 'stock'.  
There will undoubtedly be a great shakeout in that old world as younger generations gain more and more financial independence to invest in companies they deem are doing good things in the world, who operate on a par with the more ethically motivated consumer choices those young people are now making.  Bitcoin, of course, provides the perfect on-ramp for them to get involved in helping build that future.
Such is the cycle of life, as the old embrace the inevitability of change, and eventually hand the torch over to their young.

Though many certainly share your frustration the 'non believer scum' comment is definitely not gentleman :p
That said, people get very tired with the same FUD coming out when it's been addressed so many times for like half a decade now and the answers are just a Google search away.  Many of these questions belong in r/bitcoinbeginners to be honest.
I get why newcomers are worried, so let's just put this one to bed:
If you have 2 minutes to spare, the most eloquent and concise answer came from Andreas in a bitcoin Q+A video back in 2015.
[YouTube Link] (
Mining decentralisation is happening far faster than expected on the hardware level, but there's also some other interesting backup plans too.  
British Telecom, for instance, went public with a patent that emerged last year with a really neat system they've designed to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks.
See: 
It's useful to remember companies like BT and many of the tech giants (and indeed governments) embraced the exact same level of disruption with the internet at the very beginning.  Everything was chaotic for awhile then too, but the world eventually adjusted to the new adjacent possible the internet brought about.
It's extremely naive to think the scores of nerds in love with technology working for telecommunications companies and tech giants are just sitting there doing nothing, or that they aren't as in love with bitcoin as everyone else is. 
I've met with loadsa' old skool nerds at lightning meets and the like from companies like Orange mobile (remember them?) who are positively in awe of bitcoin and all the Layer 2 possibilities.  Even remember cracking a joke about how they should bring back their "The future is bright, the future is orange" 90s tagline for this new bitcoin world :p
Many of those nerds have even come out of retirement because of the "Eureka!" moments they've all had when the Bitcoin whitepaper finally sunk in.  This is why old skool geeks like Wozniak are so excited now - takes those old guys and gals a bit longer to get with it all, but when they do, boy do they get it.
TL;DR: Don't worry, everything is as it should be :)

I think the beauty of bitcoin is the diversity of people (and thought) required for it to work.  Having been to countless conferences and bitcoin meets over the years I find myself quite moved by the unlikely group of allies it has brought together across all social strata...  
The idea itself cares not for politics or idealogy and I can think of no other technology, barring the internet itself, that has been capable of doing that.
Newcomers arriving here with a Vendetta is to be expected given the disparity of wealth in the world that required bitcoin... as are the myriad forks that attract idealogically driven groups (libertarians / free market anarco capitalists that misinterpreted Adam Smith etc.) that want to use bitcoin as a battering ram against the old world.
But amidst all that infighting, greed and schadenfreude, the quiet ones will continue to keep building on a technology that will forever remain ambivalent to the petty whims of humans.
Scientists who see a decade down the line need only think of what we're all going to do with ourselves when bitcoin leads to a world of abundance and, with it, our inevitable ascent to a Type I Civilization ;)

Let's say, the UN head out to the middle of nowhere in Africa with a few raspberry Pi's, some solar panels, a bunch of Trezors, and a $20 used satellite dish... They then bootstrap a micro regional economy based on a crypto currency the locals control... which they hook up to the bitcoin satellite array to link into the global tradenet so they can exchange goods with bitcoiners and, when locals need resources, they can go take their Trezors into the larger African cities to trade with Bitcoin merchants.
Get good at this, and we could simply ship "economy in a box" solutions that contain everything villages might need to get up and running in days.  Dropping these over places in desperate need of help and we would empower locals to establish trade links with the west and help them rebuild without the need for traditional on the ground intervention.
This also works for western cities.  A bunch of towns in the UK have had local currencies for years called LETS - the Brixton pound, Lewes pound, Bristol pound.  A Layer 2 enabled crypto would be the natural evolution of these local currencies and give towns more sovereignty and autonomy and allow for greater public spending transparency and crowd driven governance whilst still enabling them to take advantage of the wider bitcoin ecosystem.

Love Mike's optimism, but like many investors waxing lyrical about all this, he seems way out of his depth.
*"...an invention has to make sense in the world in which it is finished, not the world in which it is started.”* — Ray Kurzweil
None of this makes sense in the world of today - it requires a broad knowledge of the many disciplines this all intersects, aswell as the multitude of different technologies (not just 'blockchain') which are all coming together at the same time in a whole bunch of weird and unexpected ways.  
Moreover, the space itself is evolving so quickly (just look at lightning progress) by the time you've got your 'blockchain' idea rubber stamped by paperbelt old world investors, it's likely already going to be completely out of date.
We see a lot of those old world idols and investors (who are basically just gamblers) confidently throwing around buzz words and pseudo-science on stage, who are emotionally invested in a bunch of random roulette spins they've just dived into without thinking about what the world is actually going to look like in ten years...
Exact same play for play the nerds all yawned through during the dotcom craze but were mostly powerless to stop since they didn't have the same level of access to mass media to put the brakes on any of the madness that ensued... instead they were mostly huddled in IRC chatrooms wondering WTF was going on, whilst inventing acronyms like WTF :p 
All that has now changed of course due to the democratisation of broadcast giving people who actually understand the science a more equal share of voice.
Truth is, not even the engineers actually building the core technology truly understand where this goes yet.  There's way too many variables.  So how are old world investors and their newly hired *paid* programmers doing their bidding gonna' have a clue?
I mean wouldn't you be more confident taking investment advice from Larry Page or Sergey on these matters?  Of course, neither of them would have the hubris to try to tell people where all this is going to go, since no-one with real scientific credibility and integrity would dare to without throwing out a bunch of caveats and warnings...
Ultimately, regurgitating statements from old world investors everyday on this Reddit (this was posted yesterday) will have no bearing on what happens next with the technology, which is the only thing that really matters.  
It's now a wait to see what cards tech giants are about to play... then, maybe, you'll see money (and, more importantly, tech specs) come in from silicon valley stalwarts as they bet on the future of all this with action, not (buzz) words.
That will mean seeing a bunch of projects come out of stealth that aren't actually 'blockchain' vapourware... are based on *real* science and will be ready to onboard already established userbases, which have been built by fully formed tech teams who've been creating stuff on the internet for decades and who are in love with the technology first and foremost as opposed to the money enveloping it.
Then and only then will you see 'smart money' following the actual 'smart people' in the tech space, who have so far been very quiet as they patiently wait for the landscape to mature.

Especially when you get all the incentive structures wrong for 'permitting' those innovations to happen.
There's a reason our greatest inventors (Tesla, Wright Brothers) had ZERO interest in making money.  There's a reason bitcoin developers are still here half a decade after attaining financial independence.  A reason people like Richard Branson still get out of bed.
There's also a reason there isn't a single monument, statue, or Google doodle on the planet that honours the size of those imaginary numbers in a bank account our ancestors accrued in their lifetimes ;)
Never does anyone lie on their deathbed and say "I wish I'd made more money".  Plenty say I wish I'd been kinder to people, taken more risks, been more generous with my time and ideas, been more loving.

Remember we're just 'specialists' in the crypto / computer science side of this information renaissance.  But myriad technological advances are happening in parallel.  I only have a vague idea what is going on in neuroscience, genetics, VR, energy, AI, food manufacturing and so forth.
What happens when neuroscience develops an effective way of working out if a human is lying in court (I think they're pretty close to that already)?  What happens when, instead of putting people in jail, we develop VR 'rehabilitation' programs. 
What happens when VR becomes so real, we all get to experience the "astronaut overview effect", travel instantly to distant shores and step into the shoes and experiences of others?  
All of it comes down to property and ownership in the end.  Truth is, we've stacked ourselves up in cities like rats thinking we need to own things, but travel over practically any western country and we will see the majority of the land is empty, reserved for agricultural farming.  With lab grown meat and vertical farms, what happens to all that land when it's no longer useful for faming?  Will the concept of working to pay a mortgage so we can own a little parcel of land seem completely outmoded to a freely roaming nomadic trustful species happy to share resources?
What happens when Google Calico (or some team like it) finally work out how to reverse aging?  What happens when we automate practically every job and concepts like UBI take off?
Surely, we realise the only reason we had 'defective humans', was because the system of artificial scarcity propping up an illusory 'economy' was a defective illusion?
I was a big fan of strategy games growing up with my Amiga A500.  My favourite was Civilization.  Winning the game well, is to master new inventions and technology and understand how exquisitely dependent on one another each of the various advances are...  Ultimately there comes a time in the game where instead of war, the very best thing each nation can do is to divert all energy (economic and otherwise) to the pursuit of science and technological progress.  
I think my favourite quote of Mark Zuckerburg's applies here: "We overestimate what we can do in a year, but underestimate where we will be in 10."

Many of us have been discussing these concerns for the last 5 years or more... I can only pass on some wisdom given to me by one of the hardcore scientists at MIT who has been working on bitcoin since 2009 and certainly put my mind at rest when he said: "There are backup plans for backup plans for backup plans."
So I say, stay vigilant but find the time to relax... focus only on the truth as you know it, be open to new ideas and don't get caught up in the "eternal Septemberesque" armchair commentary from people who don't understand computer science... Then figure out what part you can play in all this... and trust that the ecosystem and its participants are finely balanced in such a way that eventually the optimal solutions will find their way into the light.
The bumpy road ahead is long, but it's not the destination that matters for us all; it's the stories and friends we made along the way who we shared the journey with that truly matters.

Bitcoin is now entering the same cool and trendy phase in Britain that the word REVOLUTION attained after it's rather edgy insertion into the national consciousness in 2011 via protest art (there's now a nightclub chain called revolution, a banking app, countless bladdy "Join the food revolution!" type adverts using the word to sell us rubbish we don't need, a book by Russell Brand etc.)

Sure and the banana was the only currency with inherent intrinsic value at the very beginning of it all, since we could eat it. I'm not sure what point you are trying to make.
Perhaps a short [Alan Watts lecture]( who nailed all this nearly half a decade ago, may shed some light on the confusion between what we today call money and what constitutes actual real wealth.
'Free Trade' is now just a doublespeak soundbite; so utterly devoid of any real meaning you may aswell be shouting 'Freedom Fries'. 
Fast forward to your year 2050 then, and ask yourself what value those outmoded idealogies so many cling to today would mean if 95% of jobs are automated, the concept of a collaborative sharing economy and RBE takes off and we all have global citizenship where food, property, shelter and all basic human needs are met at zero cost due to us having eradicated artificial scarcity and built resource based economies that *truly* economise.
If it helps, go back in time to WWII and a Britain that could not imagine a welfare state before William Beveridge came along in 1942 with his breakthrough 'The Beveridge Report' ... or even better, time travel to 1776 and a pre Adam Smith world before he penned 'The Wealth of Nations' and think about how that shook up the inter-subjective realities and idealogical belief systems those at the time clung to.  
Adam Smith, Karl Marx... dusty ism's and ist's from the past no longer relevant to a global world of individuals... Buckminster fuller was right... forget it all, it's all in the past... none of those great works foresaw the global world that would become accessible to *everyone* through air travel, and the eventual democratisation of information, trade and communication that came with the internet.  Nor did they forsee the enlightenment that would ensue when the average politician and ordinary citizen began to truly understand the hitherto hidden banking wizardry that Henry T. Ford assured would lead to "revolution before breakfast" if they did.
We simultaneously straddle a world of God like technology whilst peddling medieval belief systems and subjecting one another to palaeolithic emotional states... 
We all have Star Trek's communicator in our pocket, the equivalent of Douglas Adams' Babelfish universal translator, a global currency at each of our fingertips, access to GPS satellite arrays and mapping technology that could never have been envisaged by our ancestors... 
And yet there are still some people that think all that needs to be placed into a box our ancestors constructed for a very, very different species.  A species that hadn't even yet come up with Darwin's theory of evolution.
Laughable ain't it?
If you haven't already read it, I highly recommend one of last years best selling books [Homo Deus: a brief history of tomorrow] ( which outlines much of that future I've painted here.  There is a great deal of excited chatter (at least in London circles) amongst economists, futurists and academics who have read Noah's work and are beginning to see how we may be on the brink of a new golden era.
Indeed, frequenting coffee shops in the right London neighborhoods, and hearing the things being discussed therein reminds me a lot of the coffee house stories historians tell of during 18th century London; discussions which lead to the [age of enlightenment] ( 
I'm quite sure, of course, this isn't isolated to the UK, and a fair bit of those discussions are of course spilling over into online platforms like Reddit aswell as debate forums at universities the length and breadth of the entire globe.
As an aside, the 'prequel' to Homo Deus - ['Sapiens: a brief history of mankind'] ( by the same author is also a tremendous read.

That's where the blockstack ID's I mentioned enter into the picture.  Think of that as you might the 'verified' check mark we see on Twitter accounts, except it's universal, decentralised and impossible to spoof.
Also bear in mind, it's likely the concept of phone numbers will be pretty arcane in a decade.  We don't really need them anymore.  
It's easier (and cheaper!) to call a friend or business on hangouts via the internet without the need for legacy phone networks.  
Perhaps then, if blockstack became the chief identification protocol and internet access became ubiquitous, phone numbers will eventually go the same way fax machines did after the email protocol took hold.

Yes we are at that point now, and that is largely a part of bitcoin becoming a victim of its own success.  Ethereum will face the same problems when it too has to scale.  I share your frustration, but I am acutely aware that these 'first world' teething problems are nothing compared to the very real problems in places with huge currency woes where bitcoin is literally saving lives (and property) every single day.  
Whilst that might not really resonate with a westerner who just wants a cheap coffee, it certainly does with agencies like the UN and Governments who see bitcoin has a real shot at reducing everything from forced economic migration to corrupt agents subverting western aid budgets to empowering impoverished individuals with frictionless micro loans and UBI schemes...
As for hardware constraints, even 8mb is not enough to deal with the kinda' throughput we could expect from the machine payable web, IoT, VR game worlds, and an entire retail and manufacturing world using bitcoin as their financial backbone.  
None of that is to downplay the very legitimate issues you have brought up, they certainly need to be looked at (and are) if bitcoin is to be adapted into use as a payment instrument.  Again, LN will be the saviour here, and I personally can't wait to start playing with it to see what can be built in the online world.
Right now we have a bunch of amateur quacks who are making handfuls of cash out of aging architecture that needs new layers to service growing needs, suggesting we apply a band-aid to an ever growing wound... when in the room next door we have some of the best surgeons in the world who have just invented laser surgery and are happy to give you the treatment for free.
Realise you are at the beginning of bitcoin (arguably the most fun part because it's all so new and exciting)...  You got here early - just as I did when I started playing on BBS boards when the internet first sprang into existence.  That wasn't (and still isn't) perfect, either.  
Ultimately, you can be excited about the future and help shape it, or you can mope around and complain about the imperfections in the present.
Either way, bitcoin is gonna' evolve at its own pace, regardless of the (im)patience threshold of particular individuals and companies within the community.

Started in BASIC on the ZX Spectrum 48k circa 1982 (the year it was released), moved onto CLI on the Amiga, then COBOL, Pascal, Assembly, C. About the same time I found BBS boards, the Amiga demoscene and shareware networks and then, later, IRC where a small group of us nerds would witness the birth of Napster and bitorrent.  
These were a natural evolution of the underground file sharing networks we were already part of (operating via the DCC and  FTP transfer protocols).  e.g they bought a much more accessible, user friendly front end to filesharing the nerds were already doing, opening it up to the masses.  Again, we can see how this is applicable to bitcoin.
I also had lots of fun with JRun and Java during that time, building HTML sites that would run off boxes running in my bedroom.  Then came PHP, mySQL and Apache as things started making more sense in terms of how we could affordably scale our creations.  Which I would liken to Layer 2 solutions on bitcoin, now this landscape is maturing.

Exactly, it's all very tiring, but to be expected given our 'leaders' in the old world have made their mark by pitting ordinary people against one another, and made a business out of twisting the truth.
I often say to those insistent on placing others in tribalistic boxes "what would you do with your life if there was nothing (and noone) to fight anymore?"
It's that simple in the end.  We can choose to fight or we can choose to live and let live.  It's a simple choice we can all make.
I truly believe we are on the cusp here of all this finally putting an end to war, poverty and greed and the whole of the species waking up to the fact we *already* live in a world of abundance.  
I find great cheer in knowing that behind the scenes, many others believe this too, keeping their heads down so that the technology may eventually do all the talking for us.
We then get to put our feet up for a bit, declare a job well done, then figure out what we're gonna' do with ourselves when the robots are doing all the heavy lifting for a humanity that had once been completely enslaved by a system that sold them into the lie that the world had to be cruel and harsh... That is, until a few wayseers came along in 2009 to pull themselves (and everyone else) out ;)

Seeing you get worked up and angry is what gives a bully their kicks.  The best way to deal with anyone like that, is to simply ignore them.  
You are not forced to go into the r/btc sub for your daily cortisol release :p (or, for that matter, *any* subreddit populated by people who may increase your blood pressure :p).
If the original group of bitcoiners had allowed the hate and ridicule promulgated by r/buttcoin naysayers to slow us down back in the old days, none of us would be here right now.  
There's plenty good, positive things we can all be doing instead of getting caught up in the "he said, she said" drama.  Bitcoin cash is only a 'threat' if we perpetuate the myth that it is. 
Better then, to concentrate on getting our own house in order and ask what positive actions we ourselves can be taking to move things forward.  That may be as simple as talking to your parents or local shopkeepers about bitcoin, or joining/starting a meetup group.  
When we feel we are actively taking part in all of this and surround ourselves with positive and friendly doers, you will find yourself spending less and less time around cynics and the places they congregate.

The term I used was *abject racism*.  Back then it was socially acceptable to throw bananas at black footballers and perform monkey chants and for comedians / politicians on TV to crack racist and homophobic jokes, take the piss out of 'inferior women drivers' etc.
It wasn't until the alternative comedy movement (Jo Brand, Ben Elton et al), the rock group 'Queen' (Freddie Mercury) and myriad protest movements and civil rights activists began to bring these issues to light, that those attitudes and social values began to change en masse.

Because the technology is still nascent, and no-one yet knows where all this is going...  Whilst everyone in here passively observes the show, there are a plethora of computer scientists and universities around the globe feverishly working out how to scale this thing behind the scenes.
It has to work for the entire internet and be accessible to all.  Understanding just how disruptive that end game is going to be, means embracing the huge social responsibility that comes into play when you're onboarding billions of existing users of internet services.
Just because there's been no major announcements doesn't mean Google aren't actively contributing to those teams figuring all this out.

It's all very nuanced.  Bitcoin cash and bitcoin face off against the very same naysayers in the old world who are yet to fully understand and embrace the seismic socio-economic changes this technology brings about.  
The division they have created is a net gain to bitcoin in the long term since it has given a place for patent trolls and 'business has to be ruthless' types to keep busy and push the resilience of the original Bitcoin community and the code behind the vision, to its max.
The fact bitcoin cash have had to do everything in the open and in realtime has shown everyone how adopting the same unprincipled zero sum tactics that have shaped the world over the last 50 years ultimately lead us all to the same cliff edge that old paperbelt system did.  Dock puppet accounts, the spreading of lies that contradict fact and science, brute forced advertising campaigns, twitter botnets — *all of this* is nothing but a grotesque echo of the same tactics that lead to the buying of minds in recent elections and upsets like the Brexit referendum.
Except it's all happened in bitcoin world at about 15x the speed and with it, the truth spoken by the 'quiet ones' has prevailed over 5 years instead of taking half a century!
There *are* many good people and ideas in bitcoin cash.  And many innocent people caught up in the confusing crossfire of idealogically driven rhetoric.  But we all have far more in common than we do differences.
I look to Bitcoin cash as a group of very angry folk, over eager to see all this happen *tomorrow*.  Many have legitimate reason to be so very disenchanted with the old world, but anger is not what moves the entire of humanity forward behind this.  It only separates in the end.
Thus bitcoiners of the original 'alliance' should relax.  Knowing that at any point 'the hoarde' can be unleashed if that alliance doesn't keep moving the good ship forward fulfills the need to keep everyone at the table (in old world and new) playing towards harnessing the technology for good where it will best benefit the end users.  It is they who will ultimately decide our destiny in all this.

Possibly.  
Having been to a few developer conferences and seen him talk, I think it's clear he loved / loves bitcoin as much as everyone else and desperately wanted to protect the technology, and saw the best way to do that was to force it to move forward as fast as possible by 'taking charge' as he might a Google project.
Seems he was just more used to working in a professional environment with more rigid chains of command, and couldn't cope with the painfully slow consensus process.  
This can be an issue for brilliant engineers who are light years ahead of everyone but have to keep stopping to explain themselves.  Especially if they're not very good at communicating and nurturing the over exuberant youngsters in this space who *must* be given an equal share of voice for all this to work.
He of course missed the importance of consensus, whilst Gavin just sat on the fence uhmming and aaahing.
Like it or not, his departure painting the possibility of bitcoin failing made everyone double down and work even harder than before and address many of the issues he bought to light.
By ceding control the way he did and going to R3 when bitcoin was being attacked from all quarters, he actually gave everyone in bitcoin a fighting chance, whilst lulling the old world into a false sense of superiority.  
You don't go from leaving a comfortable high end security job in Google to then go work full time on bitcoin (back before the world had even heard of it) to suddenly being happy in a banking environment... Secretly, I'm sure Mike wanted the baby he gave so much of his life to, to ultimately survive.
Mike had many amazing ideas that were a little too ahead of their time, but layer 2 represents an opportunity for both Mike (and who knows, maybe even Gavin) to come back into the fold, put the past behind them and let their code on layer 2 do the talking.  
Would love, for example, to see him build that global tradenet he's been dreaming of for nearly a decade now that the technology is more or less ready ;)

Bitcoin is somewhat different in that many people have a strong emotional attachment to it and want to see the idea succeed long term.  They are also aware that Bitcoin crashes *up* as waves of euphoria take hold and, with it, the memes.  We saw this last year when 1k support levels were regularly surpassed in matters of hours.
It's fair to say then there's a whole lot of 'old' money that have caught these waves many times before (waiting in fiat limbo on exchanges) who will prop up various support tiers as newcomers pour in during the next rally.  Unless people and companies *really* needed the fiat when they cashed out at the $20k top it's unlikely their money has gone anywhere either.
Add all that together and what we begin to see is just why with each new 'mega rally' that combination of 'old' and 'new' money keeps seeing bitcoin reach record ATH's.  Whilst all this is happening the tech keeps advancing further, as does regulatory clarity, which further bolsters confidence. 
Here's the interesting bit for non techies... What few realise, perhaps, is that bitcoin appears to follow the standard "summer slump" we observe with all large internet services.  This is a period when many in the northern hemisphere are spending quality time outdoors and less time glued to their computers and smartphones.  Internet traffic begins returning to normal early August.  This is also the time tech savvy students and those in the early innovator demographic return to university in many places in Europe... All of whom help form the initial waves of the new money bursts coming in.

The quora link was lazy, and you're right to call me out.
I'm guessing you're referring to the 'patent war'? 
I'm not a fan of patents, but it can perhaps be argued that since they were up against Alexander Graham Bell and the American government their actions could be viewed in the same way people in this space feel the need to put defensive patents in place to prevent large corporations steamrolling homegrown innovations.
They always struck me as honest, fiercely independent self made tinkerers and engineers obsessed by an idea who made legitimate breakthroughs against all the odds on a tiny budget... only to see their hardwork exploited for commercial gain, which they eventually ended up getting swallowed up by.
It's the same story with Tesla and Edison... The world would no doubt have free electricity right now, had Tesla's vision not been exploited for monetary gain.
About the only person in recent history to break this cycle was Tim Berners-Lee when he gave the world wide web to humanity for free, even though he knew had he patented it he would have become the richest man on the planet overnight, but that in doing so it would have severely throttled the technology to the point where there'd be a diaspora of corporate internets where noone could gain access to a single universal truth.  
Which, if you think about it, is the exact mess that competition over electricity and aeroplane industry profits has taken (and restricted permissionless innovation) in those technologies.
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:15:39
That's the point isn't it. 
Bitcoin is for everyone.  
As we evolve consensus platforms and *real* liquid democracy off the back of all this: increasingly, decisions (and the oxygen of airtime) will be given to the entire global crowd, regardless of background or idealogical viewpoint.  
As we get used to detaching the cult of personality from these ideas, these consensus platforms driving decisions begin to look a lot more like Wikipedia.  Noone cares who the authors and editors of those Wikipedia articles are, only that due diligence is being done to ensure we have access to the truth.
Everyone gets a say over matters, but consensus is what drives action.
We don't necessarily care what crazy belief systems a contributor may hold (and neither will the globe if those beliefs can't be propped up with fact) but I may care about the invaluable knowledge you have about problems in your local community or advice on, say, transportation systems if you happen to be an expert on these matters.
We then begin to see a new internet era permeate and evolve into a system of liquid, realtime democracy where quality of information is more valuable than advertising powered noise.  Which was always the original vision for an internet powered by micro payments and quality contributions.
In such a system, everyone feels they have a voice in their chosen domain of knowledge and so are no longer needing to drive idealogical viewpoints in order to seize control in a 2 party system that will always insist we must be divided in our views.
That, in essence, is the very system that has been governing bitcoin for 9 years and the *real* breakthrough that will soon become self evident to the planet when that process is made more user friendly and rolled out (via lightning and layer 2) to multiple online platform prototypes tasked with upgrading hierarchical old world governance systems.
TL;DR: Welcome to the era that will be known as 'the passing of ignorance' ;)

Ideally there'd be cross industry support though with Google and W3C moving at the same time.

So all other FUD thoroughly debunked, we now have them at the stage of engaging in meaningful discussions being addressed by layer 2.  
Once that challenge is solved that leaves only the 'and then they join you' stage.  Expect them to race against each other to be the first to offer 'crypto management services' to customers offering interest on holdings, storage and insurance services etc.
That's potentially good for the old folk keen to onboard as the transition to a bitcoin world happens; we should encourage it I think.

It would likely be a semi-disaster if he/she/they returned with the Satoshi moniker.  Those old appeals to authority figures would once again rear their ugly heads and we'd be back to square one.  Just look at the CSW / Satoshi 'vision' cultism that exists right now to give you an insight. 
The only time that should ever happen is if bitcoin truly was facing a crisis.  I think one of the Satoshi accounts reappeared briefly during the Dorian affair to say "I am not Dorian".  Take from that what you will.
The whole point of this experiment was to create a consensus driven peer review process (that has no leaders at all) fit for a digital global age where decisions need to be taken in real-time.  Rubber stamped faxes in closed boardroom meetings can no longer cope with the rate of technological and socio-economic change.  These are systems that are operating in 'Plato's Cave' such is the degradation of information they are basing decisions on.  Eventually systems that have less access to information and truth, get corrupted by power.
In contrast, Bitcoin has a realtime, open and agile governance system that cannot be corrupted by power; its process is immune to powerful personalities and/or corporations with vested interests... and since every decision and idea must be exposed to the scrutiny of the public, we have built the perfect system of governance with baked in transparency in order to maintain integrity. 
The pseudonymity of participants means no 'votes' can be bought, it's decentralised nature means we don't get homogeneous groups forming that can be strongarmed.
There is a digital 'paper trail' spanning 9 years that anyone can scrutinise, which further ensures actors are incentivised to stay honest.
In addition, it is a system that is blind to idealogy, race, nation state, economic status, religion or age.  It does not care for ivy league certificates or linked in recommendations.  Having friends in high places does not get you a leg up.  Only the validity of your ideas carry weight.
Everyone has an equal share of voice, every idea and viewpoint open for discussion.  Anyone can join, anyone can leave.  
I think bitcoin, then, perhaps holds the key to how all hierarchical systems and institutions of the future will be rewired and upgraded and will eventually lead us to an incorruptible global planetary management system where we are all invited to participate.

One suggests no concern whatsoever; a sort of Ayn Rand 'everyone is out for themselves' zero sum worldview vs. recognising that, given the right environment people will do what's best for the group as a whole once basic needs on Maslow's hierarchy have been met.  Contemporary thinking on UBI suggests minds are swaying toward the latter.  
The not being overly concerned I would say is about recognising that we are all interconnected and that we can only each do so much within our circle of influence to help push humanity forward (thus getting overly worked up by what other people think and say and about events outside of your influence can have a detrimental impact on your capacity to do actual good within the group you *can* influence).
In bitcoin that might just be talking to your grandma about its merits.  Outside of that it might be teaching grandma how to use YouTube to listen to all the old radio shows she likes as a kid (instead of focusing on world events reported in newspapers you have no clue or control over since there's way too much noise).

There are plenty salespeople, self taught computer programmers and intelligent recent CS graduates (with impressive qualifications on paper) that have managed to sell impressionable old world investors on the 'blockchain' not 'bitcoin' line, who are *emotionally* invested in their post graduate and/or telegram startup idea working.
But in that camp you will find precisely ZERO *actual* computer scientists who have decades of experience scaling stuff on the internet and were here at the beginning of bitcoin.  
Whilst they may be less vocal (and therefore appear to be fewer in number) you will find them to be far more rational since they are not emotionally or, indeed, necessarily fiscally attached to any of this... due to the fact, having already made their mark on the internet long ago, they've nothing to 'prove' to the world.  Which means they can put ego aside and concentrate on the science without bias.
Of course, we all knew this was going to happen, just as we knew B2X was going to happen when we saw the trajectory of those businesses in this space with ulterior motives shaped by their addiction to the money side of all this, abusing their first flushes of success on the internet and the *responsibility* that comes with having real world influence that arrives with startup success.

"an invention has to make sense in the world in which it is finished, not the world in which it is started.”  — Ray Kurzweil
In order to understand where Bitcoin is going in the near future, one has to understand what happens when Layer 2 (lightning network etc.) scales the technology beyond its current state as a store of value.
See: 
Another relevant Ray quote:
“Our intuition about the future is linear. But the reality of information technology is exponential, and that makes a profound difference. If I take 30 steps linearly, I get to 30. If I take 30 steps exponentially, I get to a billion.” — Ray Kurzweil

Compete with what?  Neither the UN or VW have a clue about computer science.  Also FYI, the UN world food programme have been conducting bitcoin and ethereum pilots for nearly 2 years.  
Your comments on bitcoin POW being only practical as store of value are spot on; we call this a settlement layer...  What's truly impractical is developing a blockchain solution that is expected to hold every single micro transaction humanity makes on that settlement layer, hence the need for layer 2/3 tech to truly scale.  We want this powering the entire internet eventually, which is going to mean accommodating *billions* of transactions per second.
Of course, if you're here as an investor and have no real working knowledge in the field of computer science it is perhaps unfair of me to expect you to understand these things.  As such, many are going to fall for slick marketing tricks trumpeting partnerships with [insert latest brand jumping on the blockchain hype train] and gobbledegook spoken by programmers (not scientists) new to this internet game who are enjoying their 15 minutes of YouTube fame and 'blockchain all the things!' glory.
Nothing I can do about that except point you to a course on code academy if you truly want to learn about the art of computer science so you might better filter out the metric tonne of noise and pseudo-science hoodwinking good people in this space... 
Really, there's little further I can add except to say, try not to get too *emotionally* invested into something you don't truly understand.

And it looks like we're very, very close to Microsoft cracking it (hopefully via blockstack).  This would mean Eventbrite, Seetickets etc. would be able to integrate via a universal API and only sell to real people.
The only way for the owner to sell tickets on would be at cost via lightning to another legitimate punter...  This could be done instantly meaning you could sell minutes before a gig to those on a waitlist (if for some reason you couldn't attend).  But only at face value.
This is going to be extremely powerful when it comes to only sharing your data with entities you trust.  There should be no need for you to share your medical history with anyone but your doctor and medical staff.  There should be no need for you to share your credit history with companies like Equifax or, indeed, banks who we know have failed to adequately protect it and, in many instances have sold it on for profit (hence all the spam mails and robo calls preying on the weak).
With a universal login, Facebook would also be able to retire Facebook Connect which has been massively abused with our data and personal lives eviscerated by countless unscrupulous businesses doing highly questionable stuff with our private content in order to chase ad revenue and, in the case of some companies, sell our democratic process to the highest bidders.  Which is just as much a failure with the democratic process itself, as it is the failure of some big tech companies.
Electoral fraud at the voting booth should be fixed by all this too, and would allow the electorate to vote in realtime on many, many more issues they have a right to influence.  We call these kinds of systems 'liquid democracy' and I think they'll form the holy grail of the eventual maturation of all this as digital generations take more of an active role in helping shape the future.
Passports and other legacy documentation moved over to this system should ease international travel, making the prospect of global citizenship a real possibility since encrypted trust rankings linked to your ID would negate the need for overly bureaucratic visa screening that try to ascertain the same information via myriad overlapping legacy data stores which can take months of pen pushing vs. a system that is instant and foolproof.

Bitcoin derives its strength through ordinary people getting onboard.  Stop looking to the old world to come in and secure the future via a 'quick monetary fix' and instead go outside into the sunshine and start talking to those ordinary people about what you've learned.  
This is what the veterans in this space had to do day in day out when 99.99% of the population hadn't even heard of bitcoin.  Now it's easier than ever to get people involved thanks to all the foundations laid at the beginning by those folks who put everything on the line to get this technology into the hands of citizens that really needed it.
If you *truly* care about the technology and what it means for ordinary people, it's time to ask what **YOU** can do to help make that future happen.

Andreas coined (excuse the pun) a lovely term for these kinds of payments many years ago when discussing pay-per-second billing for video streaming: *Pico Payments* (even smaller than what we might normally class as a micropayment).
As for BCH, there's no reason they can't eventually bootstrap something like lightning in the exact same manner bitcoin did.  They too need to be patient for things to develop and pointing out holes in their equally nascent tech is just hypocritical when BTC has so much work still to do.
Both 'sides' live in glass houses here.  Whilst we all have triple glazed windows and things are looking good, we'd still do well to recognise our similarities far outweigh our differences and stop throwing stones at each other (if only because the endless annoying plink plink of stones hitting the windows is kinda' distracting) but, more importantly, because the old world are still trying to lob rocks from their trebuchet's at *both* of our houses, and at some point we're *all* gonna' need the ordinary people invested in both those not-really-competing visions, to come together further down the line.
Time for people to grow up on both those 'sides' and get on with the much more important business of moving *the entire space* forward in harmony.

I'm not paranoid of anything or anyone, I'm saying this:
I don't know the first thing about horticulture or automobile mechanics.  As such, I am not going to head into a landscape gardening forum after being a member of the forum for a week, and start telling the people in there how to plant the oak trees they've been tending to for the last 7 years.  Nor would I expect those people to take me seriously if I did.
Instead, I would be humble enough to recognise that I don't know enough about the subject to have an informed opinion.  I would also be wary of any people in there making loud noises that are pissing off the people who first planted those oak trees.
Similarly, if my motorcycle breaks down, I'm not going to ring up a neuroscientist and ask her how to fix it, I'm gonna' take it to a mechanic.  I won't take the mechanics opinion on the bitcoin scaling debate too seriously since there will no doubt be gaps in her knowledge, but I will listen to her on matters relating to carburetors and fuel-lines since that's the thing she is most passionate and knowledgeable about.
There are a lot of amazing people with brilliant talents in this world who have not been encouraged to make the most of those talents and follow their passions.  As a result, they hijack the good work and ideas of others because they feel powerless to make a real impact in the world.
Eleanor Roosevelt put it best: "Weak minds talk about other people.  Average minds talk about events.  Great minds talk about ideas."
The only way out, in the end, is to keep learning, and keep coming up with ideas that will help pull humanity forward.  If you're lucky you will find your passion and become a master at it.  When you do, you can then work on expanding your sphere of influence within that niche so that you can help others find their calling.  
Thus you reach that self-actualisation part in Maslow's hierarchy of needs and get to go to bed at night knowing that maybe, just maybe, the world is a better place for you being in it.
Everything else is just noise.

Cultures evolve... I feel you're being a little histrionic there... Chinese people love bitcoin as much as everyone else (Bitcoin is a worldwide thing and 'belongs' as much to them as it does other folk).
In addition, Chinese lanterns are a worldwide thing also.  Lots of western cities celebrate New Year with them.  
Head to Hong Kong and you'll find Chinese cover bands playing western music such as the Beatles.  Head to London and you'll find myriad Chinese restaurants and artwork.  Indeed, one of the UK Royal Palaces (the Pavilion) is dedicated to Chinese artwork and culture.
All this really just underscores how cultures share each others inventions, traditions and ideas as they mature.  Heck, we wouldn't even have fireworks without our Chinese brothers and sisters :)

Yeah I think so.  I mean, even the old timers (myself included) laughed and thought Tim was kinda' crazy when he went on the news predicting $10k by 2017 years back...
Those of us who can see the insane progress and real world adoption since those early days when noone had even heard of Bitcoin, intuitively *feel* this is going to go ballistic at some point because of all that energy waiting to be released.  
We also can see that the trivial technical issues that halted previous rallies will no longer be a barrier.  Same with vaporware ICOs diluting the market being out of the picture as a result of ad bans.
This is one way I see things playing out:
When Layer 2 matures it's then only a matter of time before tech giants play their hand, which will put an end to blockchain nonsense and finally open the door to institutions currently waiting for certainty on which way the tech side will go.
We can then expect investment to move onto sidechain infrastructure development and bitcoin as the defacto blockchain of choice begins to look like a rock solid safe store of value.  
I'd then envisage coinmarketcap looking a lot more like the S&amp;P with forward thinking companies like Tesla floating digital assets on there via Layer 2, which would open them up to a currently untapped audience of young, tech savvy investors currently out of the loop in that old analogue investment world.  This *has* to happen for any company that wants to reach a millenial demographic and the currently untapped potential that lies therein. 
The game completely changes when all that happens and $1m / BTC is looking a foregone conclusion.  We can expect BTC dominance to go back to pre-ICO frenzy levels and investors in vapourware alts and those that aren't Layer 2 compatible to begin moving their capital over to BTC.
By this point the average Joe will of course be thinking in terms of millibit ownership.

The wallet, I'm quite sure, is a backup plan...
Further, given the message in the Genesis Block, I'd venture that when Bitcoin reaches its full potential, its contents would be gifted to a world restructuring fund governed by consensus and owned by no-one.
The beautiful thing of course... with bitcoin being just code, if such an idea gained full consensus of the community, it would be trivial to move those coins out without needing the private keys.
Before we get to that stage I'd say bitcoiners (and our 'leaders') have a lot more growing up to do.  We might begin by [looking up to the stars]( contemplating our place in it all and asking ourselves "Do we really 'own' anything?"

There was no clean, easily accessible web frontend that was actually useable by ordinary people.  It appealed only to a niche demographic of nerds so did little to push bitcoin adoption forward.  I was hoping to see it evolve into a global crowdfund platform that could allow, say, everyday Africans to trade openly with individuals in the West.
It was a nice idea.
Mike's had many great insights into where all this can one day go (loved his talk about self owning cars and a global tradenet).  Be great to see him get back behind the keyboard and start building some of that cool stuff he dreamt up now that layer 2 can actually power those bold ideas.

Also try to earn it and trade it with friends who are yet to get into this... 
My favourite part of last year's run-up was the amount of old friends who got in touch during all the hype to tell me how they'd forgotten all about the Bitcoin (worth next to nothing at the time) they'd just remembered I'd given them.  I'd forgotten too, it had been that long.
One I paid £30 to do a small plumbing job was able to buy a campervan he'd been dreaming of getting.  Another, who sold half a dozen of his band's CDs for bitcoin at a gig after I taught him all about it, was able to finance the band's next EP launch with just half of the profits he cashed at Christmas.
One small caveat: I also just 'gave away' a whole bunch to friends.  They also messaged me last December asking how they could retrieve their bitcoin and cash some profits out... close to zero of them still had the wallet app on their phones or kept their wallet keys backed up, so their windfall was lost... And yet everyone I paid to do something for the bitcoin kept everything safe for years.
Lesson in that is: don't give it away unless it's on a hardware wallet or something idiot proof!  Instead trade it for your friends' time, skills, services.  Pay cafe bills with it direct to your mates in return for them paying in cash etc.   It's theirs rightfully earned then: you did a fair exchange for goods or services with them at the time; it wasn't a handout.  Then it has actual value and real meaning to them and they will more likely take care of it, at least in my experience.
This is how you spread bitcoin adoption and awareness to good people you know and trust and empower those who may be struggling to make ends meet...  If nothing else, you yourself get a little buzz in knowing your "future you" will feel all warm 'n' fuzzy when your pals (hopefully) thankyou a few years down the line.
During this quieter period I plan on buying a bunch of Trezors and showing some good, kind old folk in my life who I care about how all this works and passing them a small amount so they too can feel part of all this when they read all the bitcoin headlines (but currently lack the technical skills/knowledge to get involved).

The first known inhabitant of the British isles (whose remains were found at cheddar gorge) was black skinned with blue eyes.  It's thought we only developed white skin after developing farming that lead to a predominantly wheat based diet.  
Further, DNA tests show that of all Europeans, Brits have the closest match to the DNA of Tutenkanem, so it's likely we were largely pilgrims from the middle east.  Americans of course, are the cousins of those British / Egyptian pilgrims.
So, as we can see from irrefutable science there is no such thing as a "white nation".  Indeed, Mesopotamia (in Iraq) was the cradle of all human civilisation.
Infact, there is no such thing as a 'race', the word is a cultural determinant invented by the 'white' man in order to set people off against one another.  In reality, there is only the human 'race'.
Having spent a fair bit of time with British neo Nazis, I have found after explaining all these things and taking them to actually meet with other 'races' they nearly all come around to the obvious truth: we have all been duped into fighting one another for breadcrumbs tossed from upon high.
Humans, eh?

Bitcoiners are encouraged to think for themselves, not follow the herd.  If you get pulled in by the memes you're not bitcoining properly :p
The HODL advice should be interpreted thusly: if you aren't into gambling and believe in the technology longterm then holding has been the best strategy from day one. 
That is the very ethos where the HODL meme originated.  
That *does not mean* don't cash out when you've found your personal moon.  It means the queue for the rocket ship is long, so be patient and wait for your turn in the rollercoaster launch queue like the holders who came before you did.

- The best computer scientists (such as those in MIT) in the world volunteering and doing peer review on every single line of code and working full time on layer 2 tech.  Bitcoin has more updates and more code review than any other project out there.  And noone is paid to do it.  Moreover, there are logs of every single decision going back 9 years...  These decisions require consensus and have to happen in the open over transparent IRC, GitHub and LinuxDev mailing lists.
- In total, there are 5 constituents of consensus required... keeping the code and the network resistant to any kind of takeover attempt.
- The biggest distributed network on planet earth that comprises the miners keeping the network secure.
- Huge institutional investment and regulatory clarity that have assured bitcoin's future (CBOE, CME, ETF likely sooner than expected, solid KYC and responsible entities like coinbase partnering with the likes of Barclays).
- Prominent tech giants and knowledgeable folks at Microsoft backing Bitcoin as being the only realistic candidate for their forthcoming decentralised identify platform (and their billion Windows users).
- Leading internet luminaries (Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Apple Engineer Steve Wozniak) saying they hope to see Bitcoin become the world's global currency.  Similar support from the likes of Paul Graham of Y-Combinator (which Airbnb/Dropbox/Reddit came from).
- Like the internet, Bitcoin has no brand or leaders that can be coerced / sued.
- It requires no advertising or PR.  People found bitcoin through word of mouth and fell in love with the idea.  
- Massive real world adoption and organic promotion.  Bitcoin cafes, 1000s of meetup groups, conferences, pop songs, movie and TV show appearances, art works, ATMs.
- Huge online infrastructure and support.  Many huge brands from Dell and Microsoft to Expedia and Namecheap have been accepting bitcoin for nearly half a decade.  Many 100s of small merchants onboarding daily.
- Tens of millions of ordinary users with accounts at exchanges already established.
- Safe storage solutions such as dedicated hardware wallets like Trezor
- Nearly a million Reddit followers and the widest social media following
- The most diverse userbase spanning all social strata / country / ethnicity
- 9 years of resilience and 100% uptime.
- Lots of [colourful personalities]( and creatives doing things that give us all a smile and a giggle when things are being taken too seriously, making this one of the most fun, exciting (and generous) communities on the planet.  
- It's also a school.  Amongst all that fun, people in here and on bitcointalk of all ages and backgrounds are learning about everything from history and economics to applied cryptography and high level programming.  
- Bitcoin has its own [satellite network]( which means the blockchain can be hooked into from anywhere on the globe even in areas that don't have internet (all that is required is a $20 used satellite dish and a few modifications).
And last but not least...

There's nothing *at all* in that article that contains a shred of evidence based reasoning that leads us to be able to conclude Google plan their own currency... and plenty for us to suspect bias from the (non techie) CEO of Blackmore Retail Investment Group who were quite possibly planning some kind of gigantic PR push for their very own vaporware ICO :p
See:  &amp; 
Indeed, since Twitter have made the same bans on advertising and Jack Dorsey is on record as saying he hopes bitcoin becomes the global reserve currency, one might conclude both Google and Twitter are heavily invested in doing all they can to protect ordinary users on their platforms from nefarious outfits that neither understand nor care for the long term health of the technology itself.

Bear in mind it's super hard to predict; no-one could see the effect ideas like Napster and Bittorrent would have on the world until Pandora's box was opened and those platforms were already on top of us... so a lot of this is about rolling with the waves of chaos (and avoiding sea-sickness :p) until things start making sense.  
I am quite sure that, soon enough, someone will release something unexpected via Lightning that completely blows us away and makes us think "well it was obvious the world needed this, why did no-one think of it before?", kinda' like the way we looked at Google when it first rolled out.

Ordinary people don't care about the the circuit board layout under the hood of their video player any more than they care about the protocol specs powering bitcoin or the internet.   
As such, everyone used VHS because it was super early to get the network effect.  Just like I don't care particularly how my car engine functions as long as it gets me from a to b.
That network effect on the internet is why we don't today use a diaspora of loosely connected corporate Intranets running on competing TCP/IP proposals (that were arguably superior) pushed by Microsoft and IBM back in the early days.  Which is of course why Tim Berners-Lee unleashed the World Wide Web unto the planet without a brand or patent.  And why Satoshi did the same with bitcoin.
That said, there's a lot of basic UX issues that need to be addressed, just as there were in the days prior to Netscape Navigator.  That is an issue that faces ALL competing protocol proposals (i.e. Alts).  Fortunately, that network effect extends to developers in this space who are flocking to bitcoin in their droves due to there being zero barriers to entry thanks to the lack of branding, patents and centralised management structures.
If all that sounds familiar, that's because it's the *exact* same thing that happened with the internet.  Many of the young coders and investors new to this world who are getting all excited about blockchain, don't have the background experience to recognise the synergies at play here, any more than those that caused the dotcom crash had the experiential knowledge to understand what they were jumping into back in the 90s.

Chaos is everywhere; nature, society, law, technology, the cosmos itself... It is the natural state of a system until it eventually finds order.
Whether this be the flora and fauna that make up an Indonesian rainforest or the algorithms Google implement to make sense of the chaotic noise of the internet.
Human societies are merely a complex interwoven system of codes, laws and ideas striving to maintain a greater order so those self preservation genes we each possess can do their job.
Ultimately it is that same basic instinct to live that we share with all animals that ensures even when that chaos leads to the apex of entropy and it looks like there is no light ahead, someone like Satoshi comes along and pulls us out of the darkness.
Decadence, greed, jealousy... These all reach their height when the vast majority of resources are controlled by a few at the top who no longer have the tools or intelligence to know how to look after the wider group.
To date, maintaining that order has required force and fear playing on the very worst of human emotions.

In the past that 'something surprising' was Galileo and his contemporaries pulling us out of 1,000 years of dark ages which gave rise to the enlightenment and the banishment of ignorance.  In more recent times Darwin who challenged the reality and authority imposed by church clerics.
Today, it's Tim Berners-Lee and Satoshi's inventions challenging the clerics of capitalism.  
And for the first time in the history of this young species of ours we may have just stumbled upon a system capable of pulling all of us into the stars and beyond, without the need for the dark energies that require fear and force.
Since much of human history have been a series of self fulfilling prophecies... We might call the events leading to this new bright chapter in human history, the rapture.

Lol.  That's the beauty in all this.  If Mike and Gavin have bruised egos, they get to play the "we were just pretending to be stupid" card.  
At the end of the day, both Gavin and Mike did more positive things, and took more personal risks for bitcoin at the beginning than 99.99% of the people in this space with an opinion on their actions ever have, or ever will.  I have personally been inspired by a lot of things Mike taught over the years and whilst I think he was dead wrong trying to brute force consensus his presence in bitcoin, overall, did way more good than harm.
I don't much care for ego and politics; Mike and Gavin's brains, invaluable insights, connections, experience... and the new ideas they can now bring to layer 2 are the only things that need to do the talking.
Rest is just the crazy chaotic history of bitcoin that has lead to all of us doing and saying some very stupid things born of mislaid fears we might lose what we'd all given our lives to.

Why are you linking us to a MSM article penned by Ryan Brown (a news assistant in his early twenties tasked with writing articles to get advertising impressions) when I've just linked you to actual source material from a computer scientist with twice the worldly experience who is widely regarded as one of the planet's foremost *actual* experts and educators in bitcoin who has [debunked all your arguments]( with facts?
You are in a science subreddit here.  Not an entertainment weekly watercooler meeting.
[Here's a nice lecture from Elizabeth Stark]( of Lightning labs explaining the next evolution of Bitcoin via a suite of technologies we call Layer 2 (which solves the current issues with regard to fees and makes this more practicable as an everyday currency).  Think of this like you might the video streaming protocols that were added on top of TCP/IP that made sites like YouTube possible a decade into the internet's evolution... when it too needed to scale to accommodate more use cases.
Finally, here's a nice helpful text on Critical Thinking:

There's nothing I disagree with here.  Note I was talking exclusively about the bitcoin blockchain which will likely eventually evolve to layer 2/3 and sidechains / drivechains with some important alts like monero (which satisfy a very specific usecase) being able to hook into bitcoin via atomic swaps.
This is a slow process with a steep learning curve with a lot of noise surrounding it.  Be patient with those yet to understand the things we all take for granted and help guide them in the right direction with kindness and humility.  Remember it was not that long ago you were new to all this too.

There is a lot of ignorance on both 'sides' and a huge inter-generational digital divide that needs to be crossed.  
Millennials take their intuitive grasp of all things digital for granted, whilst that old paperbelt boomer world is reeling from its inability to keep up with the rapid rate of information and knowledge transfer happening across the hyper connected digital communities shaping all this.  They are two cultures completely alien to one another, which has created misunderstanding and needless angst on both 'sides'.
And yet, regardless of 'sides' , anyone who has conducted sufficient research in an unbiased manner draws the same conclusion: fiat will be supplanted by the superior technology that is crypto.  As sure as email became a more efficient way of sharing the majority of written communications.
With that in mind, younger tech savvy generations eager to see all this happen tomorrow need to be mindful of the many older generation institutions, jobs and industries that are being disrupted here and the many good people within them working tirelessly to catch up who are very worried by what all this means for the 'reality' they gave their lives to.
We can't simply pull the rug on all that in one fell swoop, any more than the old coal mines could be switched off overnight (and the tens of thousands of livelihoods depending on them).  Yes, better, more efficient electricity production made flipping a switch on the older technology the logical thing to do, but it also required patience, humility and kindness knowing just how many lives would be thrown into turmoil by those seismic changes.
This is a complex game of socio-economic jenga requiring myriad concessions be made (in old world and new) to accommodate the eventual inevitability of where all this leads.
In the middle of all this is a generation often forgotten (Generation X).  They are like the referees in this jenga game, since they are the only generation that remembers and understands that pre-internet boomer world, yet are equally as tech savvy as the millennials (having built many of the tools they today take for granted, growing up with a fully formed internet).  X also happen to be the generation who built (and are now holding together) all that ailing banking infrastructure... and they desperately want to see bitcoin succeed (afterall, it is their generation that first started tinkering with it and, before bitcoin, P2P tech like bittorrent).  Indeed, many millennials were barely through puberty when bitcoin was first being built :p
In the meantime, FUD and panic from that old world is to be expected.  Just as millennial hubris and impatience is to be expected.  Both slow down the bridge building necessary to make all this work for the only people that get to decide all this - the end users (ordinary people who criss-cross every social strata and nation state).
There is no excuse for ignorance. Millennials would do well to go study history and learn of the many amazing things our ancestors did to bring us to this point in time, and the many good people working in the light in that old world helping everyone find a way toward a more fair and equitable future for us all.
Boomers would do well to go study the many amazing things youngsters are doing to save humanity from a world that nearly got choked by those using red tape and the two tier justice system to try to dominate, control and wrap every product of the human mind in a neat little business plan designed to generate nothing but imaginary numbers in a world they thought would never run out of resources.  Could it be a 40 year old finance degree taught by a world that never anticipated the internet, and information networks run through business cards and 3 day old newspaper print might no longer be applicable to the newly emergent reality built on digital networks able to react to events and inform reality in realtime?  
We need less noisy 'opinions' and fluff from people who know very little about science and technology... And more facts and well rounded discussions.  This is a grand science project, not an entertainment channel where we get to revel in the melodrama.
Ignorance and intolerance on either 'side' is no longer an option for those who want to play a part add have real influence in helping shape this grand project of the human mind.  Being humble enough to accept you may need to go back to school and unlearn a few assumptions is the first step to preparing for the new reality on the horizon.  That goes as much for corporations and entire industries as it does the individuals in them.
Wikipedia / Reddit / YouTube documentaries require the same energy to click as do those entertainment portals and echo chambers that do little to enhance real knowledge.
There is much to celebrate... We live in an unparalleled time where free, universal access to history, truth and knowledge is a millisecond away, sat in all our pockets.  A world of information previously only accessible to a privileged few.
There is therefore absolutely no excuse to waste time listening to opinion pieces penned by those ignorant of where this science project is heading.

The Wright brothers were bicycle makers and mechanics. Their bicycle company 'Wright Cycle Company' made and sold two bicycles namely 'Dan Cleve' and 'St. Clair', both which were made by hand by the brothers and later by their shop apprentice and their flying machine's engine maker Charlie Taylor. The company was famous throughout Dayton and provided steady finance.
The entire financing of their experiments, from equipment to travel to their testing site, Kitty Hawk, came from their cycle company.
The entire cost of building 3 flying machines, two of which were without any engine and the last one with a diesel engine cost $1000 over 4 years of experimentation (1899-1903). 
This was in stark contrast to the two machines built by Samuel Langley of the Smithsonian in 1903 called Aerodrome which together cost $70,000 at that time. His project was funded by the American government and Alexander Graham Bell but failed miserably.
Interestingly, when it became difficult for the brothers to juggle between work and experiments and money became short, one of their friends and an aviation expert Octave Chanute asked whether they would agree to be funded by his close friend. The brothers refused.
Wilbur and Orville Wright were the most determined and dedicated inventors of all time. Their resilience and failure to give up is the reason why human flight became possible.

Yes, lovely.  Don't know if you've ever played sim city or civilisation? But I see a future where each of us have access to our own Tax Distribution Panels, with sliders that allow us to allocate funds on a local / national / global scale and keep track of where our money is being used in realtime.  
This would also allow each of us to invest and take a stake in projects that actually earn income much like government institutions invest public money in projects that generate income for the state.
I see advisor panels for those unsure how to allocate their budgets and a 'simple mode' for those who would rather allow others to take care of things.  Could even be AI doing all this on auto based on metrics you have indicated you care about.
Naturally, all that can be hooked into global crowdfunding and even charitable and disaster relief platforms / initiatives etc.
Cool thing will being able to see and influence all this happening in realtime.

These are all great points and the nature of this distribution is something I often tussle with, especially in more recent years when we've seen some pretty hardcore speculators and 'blockchain' investors enter the space, treating bitcoin as they might any other stock to be gamed in a zero sum fashion.  It's been sad too to see so many 'business as usual' types get caught up in numbers and blockchain afterparty's and all the power that comes with having a successful startup in this space, but one that we all knew was going to be an inevitability if this idea was to take hold beyond a small coterie of nerds and misfits.
However, the sheer diversity of people involved in bitcoin crossing all borders and social-strata... means that *any* asymmetric wealth distribution that has empowered people who would otherwise have remained at the bottom of the pyramid by virtue of the bad hand fate dealt them is a good thing.  We know that people who have experienced poverty will generally have more empathy towards others and be more generous with their time and money...  We know that when we hand out free scholarships to poor kids they often fair better at prestigious schools than those whose parents paid for them to be there and, more importantly, those poor kids bring much needed diversity in thought and perspective which is often missing from sanitised homogeneous cultures that have never seen life on 'the other side of the fence'.  
This is what we're seeing happen in bitcoin.  Many of those who started at the bottom and have gotten rich haven't simply gone on to live life at a hilton hotel resort; they are actively involved in pushing bitcoin awareness and kickstarting numerous innovative and disruptive projects that would never have seen the light of day were it not for the unique insights into problems those people (by virtue of the diversity of environments and social-strata they came from) have been blessed with.  One other major factor we ought consider is the *ages* of those people bitcoin has been empowering tends to be on the younger side, meaning for the first time in history we have teenagers whose minds are still like sponges, who don't share the cynicism of older generations, and whom are able to look at the world in a different way and effect real change.
It's not all bad news for those that get caught up in the FOMO hype either.  In quieter periods such as the one we're going through, those that got in at the wrong time quickly find that bitcoin isn't really about digits... It's a movement *and* a school.  The adrenaline of the rollercoaster dies down and they begin to understand the *why* of bitcoin and to actively contribute to the project and discussions around the nature of money and wealth; discussions they would *never* have been having were it not for them being tied to it via an economic stake they have in its success.  
If they are able to hold on through those downtimes, their graduation gift will be the sigh of relief that comes during the next bull run where they get to be the new elders in this space by cashing out, following their dreams and jumping back in occasionally to pass on their wisdom to the next class...  not that unlike how the Y-Combinator alumni mentoring system works.
In many ways then, bitcoin begins to look a lot like the old system (and, indeed, life) but in fast-forward running at hyperspeed...  When NASDAQ analysts pointed out that bitcoin charts tend to move 15X faster than traditional markets, I think the same can be said for everything else moving in this space; it's all linked to the speed of information exchange that comes with being a purely digital project operating 24/7 in cyberspace.  That's difficult for people rubber stamping documents in board rooms to get to grips with, but something that digital natives multitasking through multiple notification tabs on their smartphone, intuitively grasp.   
Conflate all this... and we can begin to see bitcoin as a kind of Universal Basic Income for any and all whom are curious enough to wonder if a new world is possible, and are patient enough to stick around long enough for their little stake in that new world to be realised for the right reasons.

- Any 'job' that doesn't have a degree of creativity will be automated.  Baristas and waiting staff, even cooks will become a thing of the past.
- We'll go back to actually making things as opposed to mass producing them.  
- A lot of the material things we covet and value will have no meaning in a world where memories and mementos can be stored in digital VR spaces.  The concept of ownership will change as will the idea that others have 'more' .  More what?  Fun, stories, friends, sunrises, romantic partners, knowledge, experiences?
- The idea that we once used to spend our lives tied to material objects like houses and cars will be alien to a species concerned with experiencing everything this world has to offer beyond base material objects.
- As Buckminster fuller predicted, cities will change; office blocks will empty and become communual living spaces.  We already see this happening in the sprawling warehouse communities of North London that have converted huge warehouses into communual live/work areas over the last decade and have thousands of people living together from all walks of life.
- Communual cooking quarters like we see in those areas in North London and places like Vietnam where people gather for the evening meal will become the norm in big cities and we'll begin to wonder why we used to retire to individually crafted little boxes, to eat out of a microwave meal whilst watching a box we called television.  This alone will cut massive food waste, and engender greater community spirit.
- The majority of the inventive work that truly pushes the species forward will be done in a tiny fraction of the space, much of it online through collaborative VR meets.  
- Vertical farms and the phasing out of animal farming will mean much of the land currently in 'use' will go back to being occupied by nomadic communities which need not be cut off from the rest of society thanks to modern communication tech like 4G and advances in automated transportation.
- Trust rank will become much more important than 'money'.  Much like how couchsurfing and Airbnb works today... Access to resources will become much more open and free to individuals that are shown to be demonstrably trustworthy, allowing us to break through Dunbar's number thanks to tech advances that marry up online activity with offline that keeps track of our interactions.
- Most of us will elect to become polymaths and try many different things from music and the creative arts to academia.  Most will choose to travel wildly and will volunteer on projects they are passionate about, just as people do today.  We will take much more active roles in life rather than being content to consume fairytale stories in the entertainment realm or passively live life through the stories of others.
- Advances in life extension technologies will mean our lives need not necessarily end which opens up an entire new way of thinking about this journey we call life.  That merits an entirely new discussion mind.
- As those palaeolithic 'fight or flight' emotional states become less and less predominant in society due to the new abundance (and shared trust networks) we find ourselves in... a new human narrative that has us looking to the stars and our own inner world creations through tech like VR is what will drive us forward in the future... As a Type I Civilisation, we will begin to think seriously about exploring the 200 billion suns in this galaxy and the 100 billion galaxies in the universe.

We seriously wondered back when the internet was little more than BBS boards if music and video streaming would happen in our lifetimes.
If we think about how different the world of today looks just from the last ten years of technological advancement (the first smartphone arrived in 2007, YouTube arrived only a little earlier)...  Then it's clear for the same reason people en masse eventually adopted the superior technology of on-demand internet streaming and VOIP over cable tv and the landline... People will eventually choose to use Bitcoin+Lightning to provide a superior means of value store and transfer.
That will take time to become self evident to the crowd... There's lots and lots of work to be done in terms of education and real world infrastructure development, and a lot of incumbents that will try to slow the inevitable down, just as blockbuster video and the telephone companies tried to slow down the rise of Netflix and Skype. 
But it *will* happen... for the simple reason *bitcoin is better* than the old technologies that are no longer fit to serve a digital, global world and increasingly tech savvy citizenry.

No fog of war here, just a greater overview of the much bigger landscape and the interconnectedness of players on it.

This is about making public things that ought to be public (but are currently obscured) whilst maintaining the right to individual privacy that companies like Equifax and Facebook have already breached.
Little of all this will make sense until you begin to research how lightning network and projects like blockstack work... And begin factoring their evolution into the architecture of all this.

There's absolutely **zero** credibility to anything this 'expert' (Phillip Nunn, CEO of Blackmore Investment Group) has said.  It's all just conjecture pulled out of his arse.  He has absolutely no IT or technology expertise whatsoever.
 
Blackmore Group are no doubt just pissed the vaporware real estate ICO they were planning can't be plugged via the dark art of advertising.
See, I can pull the same nonsense conjecture out of my arse and make it sound plausible (I have no idea if they were planning an ICO).
You all may want to read up on the history of Googlers in Bitcoin.
- Mike Hearn (who famously [rage quit]( was fundamental in helping shape bitcoin in the early days (he did it in his 20% time at Google before moving to bitcoin full time).
- Googlers added XBT as the [example currency]( in the Google payment request API.  
- They also hardcoded the keyword "bitcoin" into Google trends back at the beginning, way before anyone was actually searching on it.
Banning these crappy ads does nothing but strengthen bitcoin and weaken unscrupulous get rich quick venture capitalists that are yet to understand the *very reason* bitcoin was invented was to put an end to their silly zero sum games designed to do nothing but increase imaginary numbers.
Since Google have little need to increase their own imaginary numbers it's unlikely they'd be desperate to launch their own currency unless they could be sure there would be a clear net social benefit to the ecosystem in doing so.  
Most Googlers and techies over at SV want bitcoin to succeed on its own terms as much as we all do.
It's likely tech giant token initiatives would happen via some kind of layer 2 sidechain, since that's the way most in the tech industry (i.e those who actually understand the technology behind all this) think this is all heading.

I'm guessing groups like Allianz followed the advice of lots of their fellow old world analysts this year (consensus will moon etc.) and have now been burnt since every one of those predictions was wrong.  Which means they want it to go down so they can get back in to cover losses, possibly.  They spread that number around in old world MSM circles like Goldman et al used to, and they hope for it to set some kind of subconscious psychological buy/sell marker as it used to in the old markets they played so well...  But those kind of tricks don't really have the same effect as they used to since this is such a hyperconnected digital movement full of youngsters who no longer watch MSM or read newspapers or have any kind of affiliation or loyalty / inherent respect for groups like Allianz / Goldman etc...
Meanwhile tech giants like Andresen Horowitz that have a broader overview and understanding of what's happening in the digital realm have just been dollar cost averaging and focusing on the bigger picture without feeling the need to tell everyone what to think or feel about buying opportunities.

As a Brit who has travelled and lived all over Europe and the world, I can tell you ordinary European *people* have never been more united.  It no longer matters much what the circus we see on TV has to say about that.
British people have a long standing love affair with embracing other cultures, hence our favourite foods have for many decades been Indian and Chinese.  The response in the UK to the Ariana Grande concert bombing in Manchester was not to call for separation, but a [benefit concert]( celebrating our diversity and the strength we gain through that.  There was no fear, anger or violence, no groups or minorities scapegoated.  
Similarly, the British people's response to the Syrian refugee crisis wasn't to build bigger walls... Instead, a plethora of grassroots movements were formed in the UK by ordinary British and European people who flooded the Calais Jungle with aid convoys, musicians, artists, activists and care workers.  Which lead to huge movements like Help4Refugees coming to life... 
It's here that Bitnation also had a major impact.  All of this was done by ordinary people getting up to be the change they wanted to see without asking for permission to do the right thing, or sitting back with the expectation of government to fix the mess for them.
So... The rest of you can have your silly little tribalistic vendettas born of xenophobia, ignorance and hatred... but in the end, European people with their rich cultural history and decades of peaceful collaboration will stay together and muddle through, just as we did in WWII when the rest of the world last lost its mind :p

Everyone would have a lot more respect for people discussing this if they were honest about their knowledge (or lack thereof).  It's okay to say "I don't know enough about this subject yet to speak about it with any authority."
But herein lies the rub: we're dealing with people who don't know how to use a smartphone who are getting their information from newspaper print and month old magazine subscriptions, whilst things in this space are evolving off the back of real-time information streams running at around 15x the speed of that old paperbelt boardroom world hewn of flesh and steel.
Ultimately, those out of the loop suffering from the Dunning–Kruger effect who continue to peddle blatant falsehoods (that anyone with a smartphone and a curious mind can debunk in a few seconds)... will continue to haemorrhage clients, capital and credibility, as their staff and 'followers' abandon those creaking ships of ignorance in ever increasing numbers.

I cannot believe it's been less than a year since the whole B2X thing.  Like it honestly feels more like 10 years ago.  
I'm quite sure we'll not even recognise this space in another year.  
If you can manage to control this delayed gratification thing and get your head constantly in a sort of zen like Christmas Eve mindset (without worrying about what's under the giftwrap) then well done - you've managed to extend your subjective experience of the passage of time, and hacked your way toward meaningful life extension :p

I think ethereum is an incredibly important 'backup plan' to bitcoin.  Let's not forget it was bitcoiners (myself included) that originally got behind ethereum and helped finance its launch via their ICO.
The folks involved are good, highly intelligent people, good at organising themselves and presenting their ideas to traditional hierarchical institutions and pulling in talent from those places that are not yet ready to abandon office life, a regular paycheck, and a job they can simply switch off from at clocking out time.  
As a result of all that organisation we've seen lots of brilliant ideas, experiments and beautiful looking solutions to problems unearthed through the bridges they've built into an old world more comfortable in that kind of environment.
That's not for me personally; I want to see us evolve into a world that requires no bosses, office spaces, or rigid work schedules, where everyone is free to pickup a laptop and become a digital nomad working whenever (and from wherever) they see fit.
That requires embracing the chaotic diversity of people and ideas that comes with having no rigid leadership or barriers to entry that we find in the world of bitcoin.  This is when art, music and all the other creative things we see flowing out of the bitcoin space truly flourish, and we realise this isn't just about who has the best technical solutions.  Creativity, as Einstein pointed out, is far more important than intelligence.
As for dApps vs. AWS, it's not really about 'efficiency gains' but whether people are willing to sacrifice that for the 'security gains' of knowing the app you're using isn't going to be exploiting your private data as is currently the state of affairs.
Of course a lot of these dApps are simply jumping on that decentralisation bandwagon without asking if we really need *everything* to run through a cumbersome blockchain environment.  Many are ten years ahead of their time, just as many of the ideas I had for things I wanted to build in the early days of the internet were a decade too early.  Timing is everything.
Many devs new to all this also somewhat naively think they're going to be taking on the likes of YouTube, Google, Microsoft and eBay who have spent years protecting our data and building massive userbases that love their services.  d.tube is not going to be upending YouTube anytime soon simply because it's decentralised, but it does show the old world how this could all go if they try to throttle (rather than nurture) the permissionless innovation happening in this space.
I think it will be when tech giants like Google and Airbnb begin rolling out their own sidechains and lightning powered services that many of the young pretenders (and old skool investors backing them) new to the world of internet and technology will be put on notice.
Those slumbering tech giants are now beginning to stir - we see rumbles of this with the Andresen Horowitz fund announced today.
I feel blockstack will also play a very important role in their plans.
In the meantime, it's important everyone involved remember this is not a race, nor does it have to be zero sum.   There's plenty of room for truly interesting alts that embrace Layer 2 to co-exist in the medium term.  Indeed, that's why things like atomic swaps were created to bridge the divide.  Those that viciously attack that Layer 2 vision, however, will eventually find they're only fighting themselves.

What they've possibly missed, is that millions and millions of ordinary citizens were onboarded at exchanges during the last price run-up and are just learning about all this (how to secure their coins, what bitcoin is actually really about etc.)  
Institutional investors distracted by all the blockchain hype have also possibly failed to see that when Silicon Valley tech giants are happy that scaling and other issues have been solved, prior to co-ordinated announcements of their plans (and the myriad stealth projects they're working on come into the light)... we may well see the next price surge come from tech giants themselves moving their own capital reserves into the market... which will then be bolstered by those millions of ordinary users finally joining, safe in the knowledge that tech companies (not institutional investors) are now guiding the good ship.
Then it will be those tech companies (and their giant capital reserves) deciding when to cash out (if at all) before we begin the next cycle.
I have no real clue about any of that, but there are certainly some fun times ahead however it pans out :)

Well yes, travel up north and you will see all kinds of urban decay that has lead to more vulnerable people being swayed by toxic "if it bleeds it leads" knee jerk headlines.  
These people aren't racist or stupid as liberals would like to have us believe, they just felt ignored and therefore ended up voting for the only people who seemed to be listening to their plight.
This all happened in the 80s with abject racism, football hooliganism, homophobia, sexism... which eventually changed when people learned to get over their prejudices.

And herein lies the problem.  Old world 'think tanks' shuffling paper around a backroom office meeting whilst the *actual* innovations are coming through an always open, hyper connected global information superhighway requiring no member charter, which is able to operate completely outside of their sphere of influence.
Coupled with a citizenry that are now self educating outside of state (and corporate) sanctioned curriculums... that old world network built on hierarchy was in trouble the moment a curious global populace (and the civil servants and politicians representing them) began to collectively ask the question: "why is it Henry T. Ford once said 'if the average person understood the banking system there would be revolution before breakfast?'"

So bitcoin's not been improved in 9 years?  99% of the DNA of bitcoin cash and the myriad other alts comprise 9 years of constant bitcoin core code refinements that were made via consensus.
The sheer amount of personnel, code reviews, pull requests, BIP's, university teams, dev meets, active discussion and constant development completely dwarfs any other project in this space.

Creating artificial division is what raises the greatest barrier to our ability to move forward coherently as one movement and present a professional and welcoming public face to new adopters.  
The more we all waste energy on negative tit for tat tweets and posts like this, the longer it takes the ecosystem to calmly and rationally assess the way forward.  Which is a shame, because Bitcoin depends on ordinary people in here and on Twitter presenting a united front and helping new users, just as much as it does all the people actively working behind the scenes.
I'm not even sure how some of you find so much energy to peruse the bch boards when there's so much amazing work to be discussed (and done!) over in BTC.  
BCH is not a threat any more or less than any other alt.  We don't feel the need to discuss ripple though do we?  Yet I'd say there's plenty of stuff going on in that project that raises bitcoiners eyebrows.
I quite frankly have no interest in the silly little playground arguments, any more than I cared for what r/buttcoin had to say about us way before 90% of the people arguing today had even heard of bitcoin.
But that's just me.  If you prefer to debate and argue go ahead, won't make one bit of difference to the technology roadmap.  In my humble opinion, people's energy would be far more productively spent helping others in r/bitcoinbeginners.

It went down because people who have been here a very long time and have seen these fomo rallies many times before decided to cash their gains... many of whom cycled those fiat gains into further strengthening the bitcoin ecosystem and ploughing it into cool projects like the many charities that the pineapple fund supported and creative stuff like [the bitcoin roundabout](  On top of that you had UN projects and myriad NGO's also cashing out to help finance aid projects that have been experimenting with bitcoin and ethereum.  If silly people were panicking about the non news that was an advertising ban (bitcoin has never needed advertising) then they are the get rich quick types who don't understand the technology, that this ecosystem is designed to shake out early.
At this juncture those who are actually building all this have no choice but to exit into fiat to get a lot of that aforementioned infrastructure in place, nor are they keen to see hype bubbles lead to the space being oversaturated by those get rich quick folk... 
If you think speculators are leading the markets, as opposed to the vast sprawling hyperconnected networks of technologists who have been invested in all this since day one... then I guess that just goes to show how little 'analysts' truly understand movements in this space and the invisible hands of the tech giants that are sitting quietly behind it all.

The people writing the articles work in old world media circles.  Half the newsrooms are still working with faxes, that's how far behind everyone is...  
They are not a part of the circles of influence within the realtime digital networks actually building this future, nor are most of those people in the digital realm interested in doing old world media interviews and the like, because they're busy working and see no point when they can just as easily reach a greater network of minds with a Tweet or Reddit post without having their words twisted or misconstrued.  
So who cares really?  When is the last time young people (who are the biggest adopters of all this) even picked up a newspaper?  You will more likely see them on a train listening to music on their headphones whilst actively contributing to this world via Telegram / Twitter / Reddit communities on their smartphone, as opposed to passively observing it all through dusty post-truth newsprint.

One of my favourite quotes comes from Ada Lovelace (widely regarded as the world's first human to write a computer program, before the actual invention of the computer).
She said "this brain of mine is something more than merely mortal, as time will tell".
The fact I'm writing about the thoughts she had in her head over 160 years ago tells us she was indeed right.  That's pretty cool to still be influencing (and helping) fellow humans after you are gone.  
Another quote along these lines "to live in the hearts of those you leave behind, is to live forever." — Carl Sagan.
I owe a lot in my life to Carl's wisdom that lived on in the form of YouTube videos and essays and books of his I've read.  He helped me find a greater meaning beyond material subsistence.
So no, it's not quite true to say 'noone cares' or 'the universe doesn't care', since everything in reality is essentially the product of thoughts.  The smartphone I type this on was once a thought in Steve Jobs head.
When we become an interplanetary species able to shape worlds and influence that universe even further with those thoughts then we know of course that we only achieved those things by 'standing on the shoulders of giants' like Isaac Newton.
Those idealogies that say your conciousness is illusion / immortal are not yet provable either way, however, we get closer to becoming immortal with each passing day as new advancements in science all point to ageing being a simple engineering problem.
That throws the meaning of life into a whole new light.  What if there was no end?  What if we're actually in a simulation as Nick Bostrom postulated over a decade ago?  All bets are off then: reincarnation, immortality of the mind all become possible if it turns out theres a layer to reality we don't yet know about and creators of the simulation.
So the atheist / nihilist "we're all just wormwood and noone cares" is actually as ignorant as those clerics who put Galileo under house arrest for daring to suggest we may live in a heliocentric universe.
Karma is a real thing.  Every action you take will have an effect somewhere.  You have the free will to smile at someone at the bus stop or frown at them.  One is going to produce dopamine the other cortisol.  We might call this love and hate.  
As for Judgement Day.  That can come everyday when you reflect on the things you did, learn from mistakes and strive to do better tomorrow.  The final judgement day, perhaps, comes on your deathbed when you realise YOU are your own maker.  Do you pass peacefully holding the hand of a loved one with a shared dopamine rush and knowing the world and the people you met are better off for you having been around, or do you lie alone having that final hit of cortisol knowing you left mostly frowns, as your life flashes before you?
Of course this is my reality and the way I choose to live this beautiful topsy turvy adventure of life.   It is not for me to tell you how to find meaning in yours :)

My words were most ordinary people do not **actively** participate in buying and selling of stocks.  


This is of course why so many pension funds go belly up due to people gambling with other people's hard earned money, meaning those at the bottom of the pyramid scheme end up suffering the brunt of poor decisions being made in what, ultimately, has to be a zero sum game.  


There's a big difference between taking a risk based on a life choice we ourselves choose to make and gambling.  Further, those choices do not have to be zero sum; things like marriage are generally entered into for the mutual benefit of all parties.  Whilst that might mean making sacrifices in other areas of your life, that is not equivocal to tossing a casino chip and leaving those choices to the whims of somebody else (be that the board of governors in a company you have no direct influence over, or the croupier at the blackjack table).


I, like many of my contemporaries in the bitcoin world and in academia, are far more concerned with planning for the entire future of the species (and ensuring the planet will be able to sustain our footprint) than worrying about individual 'retirement planning'.  Indeed, I very much doubt that pensions, life insurance, forced obsolescence, usury, property speculation and all the other madness that brought this world to the brink of socio-economic and environmental collapse is going to be part of our everyday lexicon by the year 2050. 
Just as the humanity of today looks back in horror at systems that revolved around child slavery, the subjugation of women, segregation of blacks, suppression of science and free speech by the church...  I am quite sure we will look back at this ridiculous fractional reserve monetary system and the casino gamblers peddling economic pseudo-science (that long ago decoupled from objective reality) with the same WTF expression a few decades from now.
Like it or not, the original denizens of the internet and many of those people behind bitcoin... have far more ambitious plans for this technology than simply moulding it to fit a broken and corrupted incentive structure that has stymied the real business of humanity, which ought be moving us all forward to a Type I Civilisation and beyond.

With lightning network running on Layer 2 the transaction fees will be close to zero.  The main bitcoin blockchain then becomes a settlement layer only settling large transactions.  So then you think of Layer 1 as the most secure store of value on the planet, Layer 2 as the fastest most decentralised payment channel on the planet that will ultimately scale way beyond Visa and be far more secure.  There's some Layer 3 stuff that comes after that which is just completely mind blowing.  
All of this will usher in a new Web 3.0 era making micropayments the thing that funds the internet and content creators, meaning advertising will all but disappear.
This is already a reality with [Brave Browser]( which strips websites of advertising and ad trackers and allows users to pay what they want via bitcoin, with revenues distributed via a token (BAT) to websites they frequent based on how much time they spend on them.

The study, now in its tenth edition, evaluates the situation in 127 economies that account for 92.5% of the world’s population and 97.6% of global GDP. **Switzerland appears for the seventh consecutive year as the most innovative country**, with particular emphasis on “human capital and research, infrastructure and business development“.
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:40:51
It's already useful, especially in countries experiencing hyper inflation and capital controls.  
As Facebook executive and social+capital fund partner Chamath Palihapitiya pointed out in this video back in 2013:
[Facebook Executive says Bitcoin Is Gold 2.0 - It's a Huge, Huge, Huge Deal!](
"I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fun, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. Because what you're talking about right now is, for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right? The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government. **It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina. Everywhere you have currency pressure.** Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. **And then, after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism.**"
Time will tell where all this goes next.  
Main thing is you don't take it all too seriously.  Bitcoin - like life - is not about knowing the future (which is impossible).  Nor is it about running toward some imaginary finish line... it's about enjoying the journey and the friends we make along the way :)
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:57:06
Yeah, we basically have the same system in the West: credit scores, police records, twitter followers, resumes, bank balance... all amount to the same gamification of our interactions with others around us in the wider world.
Now, I'm not suggesting we should all be obedient little sheep - none of us would be in r/bitcoin if we had a proclivity to follow all the rules we humans consent to... and coming from a country (the UK) with a grand tradition of civil disobedience giving rise to rapid social change; change that is often *actively encouraged* by an aristocracy who were themselves bought up on novels like Brave New World and 1984, and know all too well the dark places group think leads... 
I feel we would have all long ago slept walked into some dystopian Orwellian apocalypse were it not for the "small group of thoughtful, dedicated citizens" Margaret Meade spoke about, rising up occasionally to 'cause a bunch of trouble designed to steer humanity back toward some semblance of sanity. 
However, not all rules are bad rules.  It's OK to follow 'good' rules you generally agree with like, looking before crossing the road, being polite to your fellow humans (you never know if that person you're insulting may one day be the very person you need to pick you up from a fall) not murdering your neighbour (yup, I'm totally OK with that one)... 
Seems to me people who think they can just go around breaking all the rules we generally agree on in communities just for the sake of it (whether on reddit or in real life)... because they get a kick out of riling other people up, usually end up pretty lonely and ostracised by the wider group.  
Of course, each to their own; if you want your online legacy to be a litany of abuses you have thrown at people whilst trolling (read: bullying), then so be it.  
Not for me to tell you you shouldn't be doing that; just don't be too surprised if, in the future (since online is now blurring very weirdly with the offline world) if prospective employers and friends (and maybe even online dates) ask for permission to go through your online history to see if you hold the same values they do.  Which is not so different to the 'character references' people currently ask for in the paperbelt world to ascertain the kind of person you might be and how you are likely to treat others.
So... If you think exposing an online history of bullying/trolling may impact your chances of happiness and 'success' in later life, perhaps you should ask yourself why that might be the case?

Sure.  Absolutely agree with all your points.  
My original post was not scoffing at those who choose to invest via an ETF, it was more to remind bitcoiners who see that as heralding the opening of the lambo floodgates, that this is primarily a bottom-up movement and an ETF will likely do little more than help bitcoin along the road towards more mainstream acceptance as the technology further matures.  
This does not mean we should expect a massive bullrun that would see the market quadrupling as the article implies.
And rightly so... Slow and steady wins the race.
For me, bitcoin's most special property is its ability to ultimately reduce inequality in wealth and empower those less privileged in this world.
There are plenty average people struggling day to day out there (who don't possess the knowledge or luxury of being able to invest their earnings into stock portfolios) whom bitcoin can directly benefit if we take the time to go out there and help educate them about all this.
We only need to look to all the 'thank you bitcoin!' posts we've seen everytime there's been a major run; all the kids whose college funds were paid, student fees, people who've escaped the rat race, and initiatives like pineapple fund to see the profound impact bitcoin has already played in that wealth redistribution.
If you got into this space for different reasons, that's fine too.  Bitcoin is for everyone afterall.

We're already seeing it happen.  
Indeed, the first blockchain marriage (fully legally binding) happened a few years back and cost just a few cents.
So given the choice of paying 10k in paperwork fees with fallible notaries or a bullet proof digital option that is instant and costs pennies, what is the average consumer going to choose?  
You may want to read up on places like Ecuador who are experimenting with moving their land registry and title deeds over to the blockchain.  Check out things like ascribe.io too who are able to do the same for high end artworks with locked in provenance via smart contracts.
All the proof of concepts are out there, we've really just been waiting for layer 2 and the scaling solutions to make them practical on a much bigger scale the entire tech industry can get behind.
Most in this space are *very* careful when using phrases like "you won't see x,y,z" or "it will never happen"...  Lest we end up sounding like those old heads of IBM who, back in the day, told us with absolute certainty: "the world will never need more than 5 computers".

Sure, but what many people emotionally invested in competing blockchain solutions fail to realise with that analogy, is that bitcoin is VHS.
There is nothing I and others can do to fully temper the over enthusiastic "blockchain all the things!" crowd any more than those who wanted to "dotcom all the things!" could be chilled by the small group of scientists building the internet inline with Tim Berners-Lee's original vision.  
Eventually the hubris of new entrants lead to massive web development company layoffs when the crash eventually came.  Indeed, when I graduated from my second computer science degree, I was one of those nerds unable to find work initially due to all those layoffs.
That's ok.  I ended up building my own things and going it alone, as will many of the devs working on vapourware ICO blockchains and Alts looking to solve problems that Layer 2 will more elegantly address when they come over and learn the ropes.

Please come back when you are qualified to discuss matters of computer science in an unbiased manner.
You might start [over here] (
As I say, if you are not prepared to put in the effort we all have (nearly a decade of research that has meant reading 1,000s of CS journals), especially when good, knowledgeable people like Andreas have worked so hard to distill and communicate that research to the laymen in such an accessible manner, then there is nothing more I can add.
Fortunately, the future of bitcoin is not reliant on your opinions or *beliefs* (or mine for that matter).

He said *many*, not *all*.


This is why we insist on them doing their business over the open ledger, so that the crowd can see transparency baked in.  


I think we can all agree on that.  It is up to the engineers to provide viable alternatives to the many great ideas out there via Layer 2 / Sidechains / Drivechains (which they are).  A lot of what we're witnessing is excited, good people like Behnam eager to fix those problems *today* unawares that the technology still has a long way to go in order to mature beyond the current blockchain hype phase.
Regardless, we are seeing some fabulous stuff being done to solve real problems on the ground today even with the tech in its current nascent state.  The UN World food programme have been conducting pilots with both Bitcoin and Ethereum; the Pineapple Fund have massively helped charitable foundations that might otherwise have found it difficult to raise funding and awareness.  
Further, highly respected institutions like the RNLI are doing this the right way in terms of embracing transparency on [their donation ledger](  
We can see where it all leads, just as the original denizens of the internet could one day envisage a world where every institution, government, organisation would one day had a website... we also knew it would take a while to get from BBS chats to that new world we all dreamed of.
Patience and humility (especially with those new to all this) is all that is required now.

I'm not sure what you think constitutes an ordinary person, but contrary to what you and the author of the article may believe I think it's fair to say the *vast majority of ordinary people* do not buy stocks, nor have they ever heard of an ETF.
Certainly, younger generations (who will be the key driving force behind all this) have very little interest in that old paperbelt world (as CFTC Chairman Chris 'cryptodad' Giancarlo will attest).
Luckily, nearly all everyday citizens have now heard of bitcoin and if they are familiar with using things like banking apps, can intuitively take to using bitcoin without the need for old world intermediaries (that is, afterall, the *entire* point).

Bitcoin has no brand, like the internet has no brand.
The ultimate goal is a world computer and a resource based economy where money is a thing of the past.

@_date: 2018-06-14 16:55:18
There are two tribes at the heart of all this.  One form the more 'simple', rural folk who spend their days tending to their land and growing our food; their evenings looking to the stars.  Good, moral kind people.
They supplied our cities with resources from the land as we took to the internet and coffee shops and saw how open and connected the real world is, and how underneath our petty differences, we are all one.  
As greed and hedonism and the worship of money in those cities reached its inevitable apex, the corporations controlling them made more and more demands on rural folk, as did automation and job loss.  Decay began to set in as central planners in high castles ran out of ideas.  The gap between rich and poor widened, as did the intellectual divide.  A generational divide exacerbated this.  The old world no longer understood how the internet would decide everyone's fate, so it tried to plug the holes in the free exchange of information happening in the underground.  We only need to think back to Aaron Swartz to see how that went.
Since the elites and their highly intellectual liberal followers running that system were largely ignorant of the plight of those rural folk, those folk ended up feeling completely ignored and isolated.  They were lampooned and pilloried, labelled by the left as ignorant or racist.  When in fact the left were just as ignorant, forgetting that all those rural jobs and the people doing them were as vital to the system as their high flying jobs in the 9-5 city office blocks.
When this happens, as with WWII, anger and intolerance festers because those in 'charge' need to find someone to blame for their own greed and failures.  
Which is when bullies rise to power and start throwing bricks at a simplified version of the problem, i.e. usually anyone who ascribes to a 'different' value system.  
Be that the scapegoating of Jews in WWII or Muslims during more recent times.
Whilst Trump's tactics could be considered as abhorrent as those who came before, he was at least listening to those with legitimate grievances who have been so ravaged by the organised criminal class, and the politicians they've paid for (who wrap their actions in shiny happy business as usual MSM soundbites that cleverly disguise lies as truth) through their superior ability to manipulate the minds of the populace on both left and right via an orchestrated theatre of vested in-groups in control of the old world media and the two tier justice systems behind it.
These aren't 'bad' people, just people caught up in a system way too complicated for any of those ageing institutions and 'think tanks' to truly understand now that online speech and media broadcast is no longer centralised.
The only sane position in the end is to focus on science and technology capable of increasing the intelligence across all social strata, rather than belittling those on both 'sides' whose minds have been broken by the never ending left/right propaganda machine.  
Trump has at least pulled back the curtain and forced us all to step up and take individual responsibility for our actions and, more importantly, question the validity of the thoughts in our own heads being placed there by media talking heads, journalists penning clickbait articles and false 'experts' paid to stand on a podium.  
He has cut through the red tape, and shattered the shiny media veneer that made us think emperors with no clothes knew what they were doing, forcing us all to question every single thing we are being told to think and feel about the world.  
And he has shaken an intellectual elite who got their kicks out of belittling trump and others in order to get everyone into a state of fight or flight and distract us from their own failures - instead of focusing on the mess in their own backyards, trump was right to highlight.  His uncouth, brash and intolerant speeches were the product of an old man who for years had been ridiculed by an in-group that looked down on him and his ideas.
And yet if you pick through the vitriol, much of what he was saying was aimed squarely at the very corruption and greed that Obama and his campaign team focused on when Obama was to rally against Clinton in the original primaries.
It's a mess that has forced a conversation that will ultimately make us all stronger the moment those two 'tribes' recognise both have been as bad as one another.
We can only move forward by putting those past prejudices behind us; embracing new systems for breaking up the 'tribalism cartels' that would have unwitting people fighting for breadcrumbs and instead begin to focus on encouraging good, kind individuals to start fixing problems in their communities without them feeling the need to ask for 'permission' to do so.  To get there we only need to keep focussing on verifiable truth and facts, understand that everyone has messed up, exercise forgiveness and, most importantly, ignore the lowest common denominator circus show entirely.  
TL;DR: There can be no more 'divide and conquer' if we are to move to a world of abundance and reach our destiny in the stars.  We can only get there together.

CSW has always been a statist in favour of surveillance and control.  Take a look at the rants he and Julian Assange used to have at each other in the cryptography newsgroup back in the day.  He and Julian seem to be directly paired on opposite sides of the Anarchy&gt;Totalitarianism scale.  With Ed Snowden somewhere in the middle calling for reform.
One thing that is mighty odd is that the original bitcoin client did have some code in there for a poker client lobby.  So there's the Calvin Ayres / Bodog link that fits the CSW narrative, although easy enough for anyone familiar with the code to retroactively spin that into making their fiction seem more plausible.
Truth is, whatever Satoshi's 'vision' was for Bitcoin, he/she/they must also have accepted that there could be no true 'vision' once it was rightly handed over to the crowd to manage and develop for themselves.  Tim Berners-Lee understood this when he gave the worldwide web to humanity. Today, the web looks nothing like what he envisaged it would be and he has to be okay with that; for all the bad things people have done with his invention that have made him facepalm, there's plenty good things that far outweigh that bad.
As for whoever this latest Satoshi dude might be (or indeed any *real* Satoshi coming back) seems to me if they don't get that basic principle, their opinions on the technology are largely moot.
On a final note, pretty sure any returning Satoshi wouldn't add a Copyright symbol to their site nor deploy Google Analytics either.
If we look at the final piece of information on that 'reveal' we see:
*Information on Tabula Rasa, my clean-slate vision for Bitcoin.*
Which seems to suggest the whole thing is a cheap marketing ploy to drum up PR for whatever their next biZcoin idea might be.  Afterall, if this 'clean-slate vision' was that good Satoshi has made plenty friends and connections within Bitcointalk and the linux dev mailing list.  So why not just go back there?
But hey, what do I know?

Of course one still has to *do* the research and actual systems analysis in a given domain to be able to look at it from that new angle and innovate.  When we go into an office to automate those old manual procedures there, it can often take months of observing and, essentially, *doing the actual manual jobs* workers are doing before we have enough information to figure out how to translate all that into a more efficient digitised system.  And that's where looking at things that have "been that way" for decades from a new angle comes in and interesting hitherto unthought of solutions begin to percolate and old assumptions laid to rest.  When I ask people  "Why do you do things like this?" I often hear people reply "Well... because that's the way we've always done it!" when clearly what they're doing is massively inefficient and creating unnecessary work for everyone involved. 
 


Well there's plenty of *economists* who would argue against this.  Just look to the Austrian school of economics.  Just because the Keynesian system seems to be "the way we've always done it" does not mean it has to always be that way, especially given plenty would argue the current system was a result of a misinterpretation of Adam Smith's groundbreaking work and is in dire need of a rethink.  


I don't think anyone is saying economists are irrelevant.  I think what we're saying is they ought take Buckminster Fuller's advice and "go back to school" if they want to keep up in this space.  Experience in a finance firm coupled with a 40 year old degree you earned before computers and the internet became a thing, are not going to give you much authority in this space.  Especially when even those of us who have spent nearly the last decade in this space are having trouble keeping up because of the rapid pace of change and innovation happening here.


Andreas dropped everything (as did I and many other techies) in 2013 when the penny finally dropped on bitcoin.  Until then, *even* computer scientists had been skeptical of the technology, Andreas included.  I think it would be helpful if you understood the history of this space and just how much work and research we've all had to do over the last half decade.  
In fact there's a whole bunch of us that haven't even written a single line of code in all that time as we have had to spend so much time 'back at school' ingesting everything from psychology, sociology, game theory and, yes, economics.  Andreas has sat down with and advised the Canadian and U.S. Senates, is an independent advisor to the CME, is partner with attorney Pamela Morgan at his bitcoin advisory firm.  I have personally been to countless conferences; met with politicians, economists, activists, coders, you name it...  
That's the thing about bitcoin, because it is money, and money touches everything, to get a solid overview of what is going on you have to step away and become a polymath.  It's hard to do that if you're working in the city 9-5.  But for the youngsters coming up in this space they already have all the time in the world to put in those hours of study.  Same is true of the Computer Scientists who were already financially independent when this thing broke back in 2013 and we were able to throw ourselves fully into the systems analysis side of all this.       


Andreas is quoting from a well known psychological study devised by Ellen Langer where she shows - through various laboratory studies - that people have a tendency to overestimate their ability to control events.  It has been dubbed [Illusion of control](  Most of us suffer from this at various points in our lives, although few are aware.  Hence we will see old world emperors like the CEO of Blockbuster video declaring that online video streaming is not a threat to their business model.  That's where the delusional part comes in due to being so intellectually vested in maintaining the status quo, they fail to see the elephant in the room.
With regard economists and old world finance magnates under that illusion of control: many fail to see that money is just information.  It is a social convention; it's role has changed many times in the past and will change again.  It is only our collective *belief* in the present system that gives it any integrity.  Needless to say, that belief was massively eroded in 2008, prompting millions around the world to start asking "Why was it Henry T. Ford said 'if the average person understood banking, there would be revolution before breakfast?'".
The truth is: money has never had any real power in this world; it's mostly been about those who have access to the most truthful *information* and those able to fastest react to that truth.  For too long, the entire game has been nothing but a rigged casino, due to the corruption of truth and degradation of information at every level.
But that's all about to change because those who have access to the most informational truth today, are those that are building these new digital systems that require peer review and consensus, as opposed to absolute authority; in order to evolve.  Their very foundation revolves around transparency and openness - the very antithesis of the current dog-eat-dog finance world. 
We should be championing this democratisation of information and money.  It is, after all, why we invented things like libraries and the Encyclopaedia Britannica and later, the internet, that bought hidden information into the light.   
I think we're seeing that democratisation of information that lead to the Renaissance - and our escape from 1000 years of dark ages - happen again...  But on steroids.  In the past, it was hard for the average person sat at home to access the information required to answer that Henry T. Ford quote.  Hard for Indian doctors to get at the information locked away in western universities, and information stores like JStor.
Today, thanks to the speed of democratised information sharing and broadcast platforms, TED, Wikipedia, free online university courses etc. that learning and understanding process is happening 15x faster than it could have in that old paperbelt past where intellectual property and patent trolls stifled human information and the pursuit of unfettered knowledge... This new 'information renaissance' is happening across all social strata, race and borders.
All this may sound chaotic, especially to incumbents with a vested interest in the status quo... but then so too was the internet when that was unleashed.  And, as Tim Berners-Lee, CERN and great government institutions that have seen all this happen before, full well know... chaos was the point...
*“The truth of the world is that it is actually chaotic. The truth is that it is not The Iluminati, or The Jewish Banking Conspiracy, or the Gray Alien Theory. The truth is far more frightening - Nobody is in control. The world is rudderless.”* — Alan Moore, author "Watchmen".

This is good for bitcoin at this juncture.  As impatient as everyone may be for bitcoin to reach the global currency it is destined to become, it needs to get there slowly through ethical investors and ordinary citizens coming onboard for the right reasons.  
The FUD that is out there clouding the views of those get-rich-quick investors with deep pockets who think this world is nothing but their paper money playground... means they will end up coming in much later and gaining less than those invested for the right reasons early on who believe in the longterm potential of the technology itself for reducing inequality. 
In a way, it's the perfect system to subvert the greed that lead to the 2008 crisis and it gives the downtrodden a chance to bail *themselves* out.  
Price lulls like this give us all the time to regroup and go empower friends, colleagues and investors alike with the information they all need to figure out how to get onboard the rollercoaster for the right reasons.

That's not always the case.  This 'free market', has given uneven share of voice to those who shout loudest, meaning they can brute force poorly thought out ideas via the dark magic of advertising and skillful manipulation of media, press and online communities.
I'd argue the setback in uptake we saw with things like segwit over the last 5 years has happened as a result of people who have treated this space as if it were just a business.  Same thing happened with the internet of course. 
It is much easier to generate bullshit than refute it.  Even more so when only 0.1% of people in this space (who actually *understand* the science behind it all) are able to fully defend the technology roadmap with irrefutable facts.  
Things are settling down though as more and more people come to focus on those facts, and finally grok why it is layer 2 is set to change the rules.  Should mean that - rather than having to defend that vision - those who best understand it can get back to actually 'buidling' it.

Sure, it coincided with the [Occupy movement]( same year as the London Riots, Real Democracy Now and the Spanish Indignados and [15M movements](
See: 
Revolution bar group have indeed been around for a long time, though their clubs used to have much more low key branding.  They created "Revolución de Cuba" and began politicising the chain in 2011 seemingly aligning it with socialist movements of the past.  The chain 'Pret' had been doing this already for quite some time (note the socialist star in their branding, and the fact they pay all workers equally in the same manner co-ops do).
The revolution meme then began finding its way into popular music and art.  The most blatant example being the video ["Surrender"]( by Angel and Airwaves; a 'call to arms' for the Occupy movement which had now branched out from protest camps and into the [music world](  They then begun wielding influence in government via offshoot grassroots organisations like [Positive Money]( which were born in the protest camps through the various economics working groups that would meet there to hold public lectures and debate forums.  Naturally, bitcoin was discussed quietly too and used to help fund things like occupation records ;)
Russell Brand would later call for a Revolution on national TV prior to the next election during that famous [Paxman interview](   Paxman quit the BBC shortly after and acknowledged in an interview with Graham Norton "Russell is right".
Now the word's political undertones have been diluted via various branding agencies around the country that [picked up on the trend later on]( and things have calmed down a lot since then (England tends to have 'reformations' as opposed to full scale 'revolutions' :p).
The point of my original post is that bitcoin (which used to be dangerous and edgy, what with the big bad 'darkmarket' connotations) is following the exact same trajectory, as marketing agencies and brands like [Revolut]( pick up on this cool new 'youth trend'.  Which is, of course, all part of the normalisation process that sees it become an everyday ordinary part of mainstream culture.

You've cherry picked one thing and glossed over the more pertinent argument.  *Entire governments* are looking to move land registries onto an immutable ledger.  
Why?  Because that protects the ownership chain from ever being tampered with (either by invading armies or nefarious actors within).
Once it's all on a blockchain the only way to transfer ownership is through smart contracts which will have things like dispute resolution baked in.
Think how disputes were handled with escrow services for services like silkroad and you'll get an idea of how these things are solved.
All we're really doing is taking an old paperbelt system and upgrading it, much like the banks did when they moved from handwritten ledgers to digitised, cash to cards.
Again, this comes down to consumers and governments seeing how cutting out middlemen and streamlining those old processes saves not only time, but a lot of wasted money.

What I've found interesting though is how some of the hosts on Bloomberg etc. now know more about all this than the 'experts' from the old financial world they're interviewing.
Partly because none of those 'experts' paid attention to this and dropped the ball and partly because the hosts themselves are all financially invested due to all the nerds going in early and sending them free bitcoins at the beginning when it was worth very little.
Couple that with truth discovery via YouTube / Reddit / Twitter discussions which sees these hosts doing more research when they get home... and you begin to see how the experts are no longer the experts... I don't think even the hosts believe what they're hearing from that old world anymore.
It's almost as if everyone knows the MSM talking heads charade is over and they're all just going through the motions because what else can they do?

How do you feel this is pertinent to what's being discussed here?  Do you think the existing systems being run by Equifax et al don't already give people trapped in debt the 'mark of shame', whilst those able to exploit the system are able to operate in the dark?
Do you think there ought be things other than money and, say, schooling accreditations, by which we measure human value and their contributions to society (both on and offline)?
Would you not like a system that no longer requires central data repositories where custodians may exploit your personal data for monetary gain?

Have you all noticed how Google are able to match up businesses with their phone numbers so when they call you, the business name is already pre-populated in your caller ID even though they're not in your contacts?
I imagine a future where you will be able to vet these calls coming in against their Google rating and block any businesses unknown to Google and/or leave feedback on spam calls that slip through, just as you might a crappy app you downloaded or cafe you visited.
For businesses just starting out with zero reputation, an escrow service similar to how silkroad operated may work... with monies required to call Android users scaling with call volume, which are then locked in the escrow until positive reviews start coming in.
This of course could be implemented on Gmail in exactly the same way to put an end to spam.  Funnily enough, this would bring the tech full circle to Adam Back's [hashcash]( which he invented to stop spam emails but was later adapted for use in bitcoin's Proof-of-work breakthrough.
I hope Google and others are exploring how blockstack ID's might one day be bolted onto all this in order to stop Sybil attacks.  
Things are gonna' start getting even weirder when we can outsource reputational vetting to our own personal Robo-PA's screening calls for us.
See: [Google's AI assistant can now make real phonecalls](  Not long before we have bots calling (and mailing) bots :/
Going off on a tangent, but since it's all related to trust...
Tech incumbents like Google, Stack Exchange, GitHub, AirBnB have been quietly building gigantic trust networks - that have required no monetisation inventives whatsoever - for nigh on a decade.  Social capital accrued through helping others is all there sat on their databases.
Just look at Reddit and karma scores.  Whilst that data currently sits in tables on an sql server, it would of course be a doddle to loop through them and turn ten years worth of internet points into real economic value for their users.
I think VC's who have gotten caught up in the blockchain hype frenzy have missed what's coming... and have failed to see just how important data curated over decades at Google, eBay etc. will be when they all eventually upgrade and augment legacy data stores into the world of Web 3.0.
Old world financiers who think "every database will be a blockchain in 15 years" who are funding things that they think are gonna' take on already established and trusted tech giants simply by throwing the word 'decentralise!' at everything as if it's some kind of Harry Potter spell... are long due a wake up call.  No amount of funding, hype, clever code or slick marketing campaigns are going to magic up 10+ years of data and user trust out of thin air.
This is very lazy ' business as usual' thinking and lacks insight into where all this leads when breakthroughs in AI are rolled into existing net infrastructure that solves actual problems in new and interesting ways.
It will be those tech giants (like Twitter, AirBnB, Microsoft, Google) who are on the cutting edge of that innovation and have already built massive webs of trusted networks (and looked after people's data along the way) that are going to have the biggest impact on all this, especially as they open up their APIs to the many independent open source coding groups building cool stuff with all this.  Groups that need not answer to any masters.
When those careful slumbering giants in love with all things technology do move, I'm quite sure it will be through layer 2 on bitcoin... and there will be an almighty "holy crap" moment, as everyone in this space scrambles to get to grips with yet another new trajectory.

If you spend much time in this space you'll soon come to realise that what scientists here one week thought highly improbable or impossible, is the next week self evidently the new obvious direction ;)
Reddit is not always the best place to keep abreast of the latest tech advances happening on GitHub, it takes awhile to filter down... as you'd expect for any engineering project of this magnitude.  Likewise, those engineers on GitHub aren't necessarily privy to creative things the Reddit communities are pushing through public outreach.  
They are, in essence, two different working groups which we might think of as the "public communications office" (Reddit) and the "R&amp;D department" (GitHub/Dev mailing lists) - with a fair bit of crossover obviously.
Regardless, none of that changes the main thrust of the "be excellent to each other" points raised above :)
TL;DR: Welcome to the crypto Singularity :p
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:39:23
Well we all know what to do.  Buy (or even better, earn) bitcoin, safe in the knowledge this can never happen again thanks to governments (and the people they represent) being able to insist in future they put everything in the public ledger.
The rules have changed and this kind of transparency is probably the reason some institutional peeps are nervy about moving their funds into bitcoin.  
Will all be fine and dandy as soon as *everyone* realises they can now stop cheating the system (and each other) and focus on the more important task of getting the entire of humanity to the moon (literally).

It's kinda' what we already have really.  The world's first Bitcoin ATM was in Second Life.  There are kids in this subreddit that have made hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of BTC from creating virtual items and player skins for MMOs.  I've seen city building games running on Eth.  What happens when Google maps goes into VR and you can begin redesigning real world cities in VR?  What if you then used AR overlays with that so you could change the very aesthetics of the real world city you're walking around?  Take it back in time... Forward....

Yes and no.  All that energy, expertise and collaborative networks of people developing in the blockchain world will eventually come over to the layer 2/3 world and be able to hit the ground running.
The get rich quick sheisters will be filtered out as will all the poorly thought out solutions looking for problems and a new web 3.0 era of collaborative, permissionless innovation will go into full swing.
Until then it's good that the 'quiet doers' building stuff like lightning and blockstack have the peace to get on with just 'buidling' the future, whilst the rest argue and fight about what that future should look like (which they'll never actually create because of the fight or flight zero sum games they're all wasting energy on).

Yes and I imagine even the large transactions will eventually go through fine once LN matures.  I'm guessing this time next year it will be able to handle everything from a coffee purchase to the sale of a car with very few routing failures.
We can then see Bitcoin as a settlement layer being used for very large transactions and those people who want to continue using bitcoin main chain for largish p2p transfers will still be able to do so without incurring any overly egregious fees.
This whole thing then begins to look like it has real potential to serve as a truly secure alternative backbone to the current financial system that the more innovative incumbents can start getting really excited about.
Interesting alts that drop the zero sum attitude (including bitcoin cash) can embrace all this too once they adopt segwit and figure out atomic swaps.  Litecoin and a few others are already paving the way forward there.
If you are a bitcoin supporter with a basket of alts in your portfolio that you like, now might be the time to figure out if they're onboard with lightning or not.
@_date: 2018-06-17 18:21:29
As the people who have been here since day one and actually understand the code inside out keep saying over and over again — Blockchain technology is not the interesting part of all this.  
Unless you have a broad overview of all those other disciplines I cited you are not going to yet understand why.  In the beginning of all this (before bitcoin had *any* media attention) we all had to dig very hard to make sense of all this, get over all our misconceptions to figure out that *why?*
Today, this is not the case.  Between us we have written millions of words in essays, Layer 2 whitepapers and code.
This is also an inter generational gap issue.  Computer Scientists with freshly minted degrees just coming into this space are not going to understand the experience those scientists in Generation X accrued the first time all this happened when people like Andreas helped build and shape the internet.  Hence why you have people like Nick Szabo, Andreas and Adam Back (cited in the bitcoin whitepaper) all on the side of sidechains and layer 2 running over bitcoin.  Similarly, a computer science graduate whose only just stumbled on blockchain in the last few years, isn't going to be as knowledgeable as those here since the beginning any more than those that jumped into HTML out of university understood the *why* of the internet that we'd all been discussing on BBS before even web browsers were a thing.
The hubris of youthful programmers who have been taught to 'specialise' in an art that, when Generation X first started tinkering with these machines called home computers had no specialised career paths (and therefore became polymaths) is to be expected.  Fortunately for all those with hubris, there are just as many eager to learn from those with more experience and when they do, will be even better prepared to step up and lead.  Jack Maller over at Zap and countless others (in bitcoin core and lightning) are perfect examples of the younger generations working in synergy with Gen-X and their ability to take on more novelty in the present means they are able to build and understand stuff far faster than those old neckbeards guiding them all possibly could.  But that energy needs to be harnessed alongside the *why*, which requires both generations working and listening to each other in tandem.
Buckminster Fuller wrote about all this in operating manual for spaceship earth.  Make no mistake, Nick, Andreas, Adam are those 1 in 10,000 Bucky spoke of who are capable of pulling the rest of humanity forward.  Something our great wise boomer ancestors working in the light holding onto the old world we inherited recognise, hence why Andreas is invited to speak at the Canadian Senate about this and the average Computer Science graduate waxing lyrical about blockchain and those with vested business interests, are not.
All that is required to become part of that, is to put old chauvinisms aside and see the world, and the new adjacent possible with fresh eyes.
This requires humility and remembering at all times that great observation from inventor, futurist and boomer polymath, Ray Kurzweil:
 "An invention has to make sense in the world in which it is finished, not the world in which it is started."
Good luck on the journey friend, and those first tentative steps you've taken down the very strange bitcoin rabbit hole unfurling Infront of you :)

I remember at the time being approached by a friend at an investment firm and being asked: "where have all the blockchain evangelists gone?  Our meetings used to be full of enthusiastic techies waxing lyrical about this technology, but now it's all back to the same banker crowd..."
To which I replied "there never were any blockchain evangelists, they were all bitcoiners... and now you're all busy, they've gone back to building bitcoin."
I wouldn't say they've all been purposefully punked exactly... I think many techies went in there genuinely thinking the mess in that old world *could* be fixed by all this, only to realise the entire thing is nothing but a gigantic casino built on a house of cards in dire need of a complete reboot... and that bitcoin was the only logical way to start that reboot.
Incidentally... After years in the finance world, shortly after our convo my friend quit the investment game altogether to go pursue a career in the creative arts, and has found completely new meaning in life :)

Natures way of dealing with people like this is to release cortisol into the blood stream, increase blood pressure and stress related problems that deplete the immune system and increase ageing and their eventual early demise.
Societies way of dealing with them is to ensure their passing happens without notice, and they never end up being hounoured in museums, art galleries, monuments, Google doodles etc.

Oh I dunno, patreon have proven that people are very kind and generous when they can see their money is actually helping others.
Same with things like Kickstarter and even Wikipedia which relies solely on user contributions.  If wiki can survive because people see the utility in it, then so can an internet ecosystem powered by micropayments.
I also think with advertising gone, people will be a lot less consumer driven which would reduce the more selfish tendencies we are all prone to.

I think when bitcoin becomes the global currency those who understand the internet the most are predicting... Humanity is gonna' look back at a lot of the CNBC videos and 'blockchain' investor talking heads being posted on this very sub here in 2018... and cringe in the exact same way we do over those old internet discussions.
By then, as a bitcoin world becomes self evident, humanity will of course have a kinda' collective amnesia, as they forget how they were once standing on the wrong side of all this laughing at those freaks who correctly predicted how everything would go.
I remember being ridiculed over my gigantic mobile phone in the 90s... Then my first generation iPod and iPhone in the exact same manner.  A decade on and nearly all my peer group would forget they once told me those things were mere gimmicks.

Replace the word "trust" with "money" and you've just described the current system to a tee.  
Dopamine hits from Facebook and Instagram likes designed to keep people in echo chambers that stimulate artificial wants and needs in order to power the consumerist juggernaut that is advertising.
Things are going to change drastically when this tech leads to the end of the advertising industry...  It will of course begin on the internet and then permeate every other aspect of modern society.
That is what will spark the *real* cognitive leap toward self discovery and creativity... and ease the transition to a world that moves beyond the idea that one needs to 'earn' a living and compete.  Gone too will be the days we spent passively living through the lives of others, gaining pleasure only from fleeting momentary entertainment...
In such a world of abundance, one does not need to compete for points (monetary or otherwise).  Those dark ages of secrets, lies, pleasure derived from others misery that lead to the need to hide from each other... will be over.
With that will come a new human narrative as we collectively look to the stars to begin a new journey of outer and inner discovery.
There's nothing new in any of this... in fact [it's all happened before]( just never at this speed and on such an unprecedented global scale.
Sounds utopian, but then so too does all the social and technological progress that we've witnessed in the last century which means the average westerner today enjoys more abundant luxury than kings and queens did 100 years ago.
How crazy to think in just 120 years we've gone from the invention of electricity and the aeroplane to where we are now.  In the grand scheme of the cosmic calendar this isn't even a blink.  
Who knows what we are capable of now that one thing truly holding many ideas back (money) has been turned into an internet content type ;)

 &gt;looking at you, Eric Schmidt
Eric used to joke he brought much needed 'adult supervision' to Google.  [He's gone now](  
Interestingly, one of his facebook posts around the time of his 2017 departure mentioned bitcoin, which he wrote as "BitCoin" (a classic noob faux pas).


Every action has a reaction.  Those bans lead to Operation Payback which, arguably, put anonymous on the map.  Then again, it also lead to Wikileaks tweeting about bitcoin (against the will of Satoshi) who was right when he/she/they said it would blow this project out into the open way too soon.  
This meant EFF had to drop support and big business, politics and media descended on this space before anyone had figured out how to scale...  Had that not happened and had people been patient as Satoshi had urged, we'd likely not have any need for exchanges or the myriad confusing wallet implementations, as everything would be running through the one single decentralised client as per the original 'plan'.
This has lead to the space becoming an almost exact mirror of [the browser wars]( that big business descending on the internet initiated, which ended up setting development back (and why wise elders like Satoshi urged patience and caution before running headlong into the storm).
C'est la vie.  We work with what we've got, eh.
@_date: 2018-06-30 10:37:32
Bitcoin.org should do the following:
- Update that exchange list (it's super out of date) ordered by impartial user review scores pulled from Google ratings.
- Do Geo checking so that they serve the most appropriate exchange list first based on users country of origin.
- Embed an ATM map and link to Bitcoinatmradar, customised to user's country of origin.  
- Include a bunch of how to videos that show exchanges and ATMs in action.
I assume Google will be soon culling all the exchange ads.  The fact that .org is top is a good thing, but they do need to up their game IMO if they don't want users hitting the back button and moving to the next SERP result, especially when ads disappear.

Last I heard he had a successful show running in Edinburgh :)
I've a few stories like that, I remember a few years back this red-faced angry guy coming up to me after some youngsters on stage were talking about how bitcoin was going to disrupt everything...
"What did you think of the talk?" I ask.
"Well I'm not very happy... You lot are saying I'm gonna' be out of a job in five years!!"
"What do you do?"
"I'm a lawyer, been doing it for the last 25 years..."
So then I asked him something that made him suddenly question everything.  "What did you want to do before someone told you to get a job?"
"I er... Well, I was really good at the guitar, I wanted to become a musician.  Silly I know..."
"Well" I say "It looks like you've done very well for yourself in law... perhaps you should stop worrying about the future and consider dusting off that guitar and those old dreams of yours... take early retirement and go see the world."
There's a really long pause... Then I saw this weight suddenly lift from him as a huge grin spread across his face.  "You know... I might just do that!"
He left the hall with a new spring in his step.
Moments like that make me realise we're all on the same side and people in that old world need - more than anything - a few kind words and a reminder they really didn't do a bad job of raising those kids that are about to set them (and the rest of us) free.  A reminder too, perhaps, that many of us already have everything we could possibly need to go chase those dreams of ours once we get comfortable with the idea of just 'letting go' and embracing the unknown.

Actually Encarta wasn't even the first multimedia encyclopedia; Bill just 'stole' the idea from [Compton and Grolliers]( similar to how he 'stole' the web browser idea and initiated the browser wars.  
Wikipedia wasn't an original idea either, Aaron Swartz essentially built it back in 2000 when he created 'the Info Network' for a class project.  Timing was wrong so it didn't get the network effect.
Bitcoin wasn't the first attempt at a digital currency, David Chaum's [DigiCash]( was back in 1989.  Again, timing was wrong (amongst other things) so it didn't get the network effect.  Same with eGold that came later.
Bitcoin *did* get [the timing right]( and, with it, the network effect (which is why you're in this subreddit along with nearly a million other readers).

Yes.  He/she is saying that bitcoin has evolved from the basic building blocks of life required for a singular celled lifeform (blockchain) to something that has mutated into a far more interesting and resilient species.  
From [GitHub visualisations]( to [lightning node maps]( we see this evolution mimicking chaotic networks that eventually find order in nature, just as we do when we analyse Internet and city traffic flows, and the firing of neurons in the human brain.
Interestingly, [Conway's Game of Life]( was recently bolted onto lightning testnet via a  implementation (cue spooky inception music) :p

Yep, plenty naysayers said bitcoiners were delusional predicting $10k back when it was at $40 circa 2013.  Now we all see it as self-evident it would get that high.  Hindsight is 20/20 eh.
Given how far we've come since then... just look how at subscriber growth in this sub alone (from 10k-850,000) and the millions of new accounts registered on exchanges waiting to jump in.  
Exchanges themselves and online infrastructure services are now hardened and better able to handle large runs and shocks.  Hardware wallets and phone wallets have now become way more user friendly and secure. 
Education on all this is happening at a rate of knots (from university degrees to myriad conferences and talks on youtube) as is real world infrastructure (ATM's, Bitcoin accepted signs, ads in Times Square).
Not to mention Layer 2: Segwit adoption and batching means the protocol itself is going to be much better at handling the mempool increases that we'll see.
The only delusional ones then, are those that don't recognise bitcoin growth is about a lot more than price, and keep failing to learn from recent history.  It's really hard to say what's going to happen when that massive network reach is activated during a new FOMO rally, but I think it's fair to assume if the patterns keep repeating then $250k will certainly hit.  Only question is, when?  
Personally I think 2020 is plausible.  There will be the halving and, more importantly, it's a watershed year.

Time - like money - is just a human convention, a measurement tool.  It's not actually 'real'.
Example: If you spend 6 months sat in the same empty room, staring at the same wall, eating the same food, 
 sleeping 20 hours a day, meeting no other people, experiencing no new novelty... and then 6 months flying to a new country every week,  making a dozen new friends a day, reading 3 new books a week, seeing the sunrise every morning and squeezing as much activity into each day...
Which of those two modes of living will lead to the most new memories, experiences and neural pathways being opened?  When you then look back on the last year, which of the two modes will take 'longer' to re-live in your mind?  
Now try to 'time travel' in your mind to a world before the invention of the mechanical clock which regiments our lives today.  There's a famous essay called ['The Tyranny of the Clock']( by George Woodcock that might help you with that.
Go back even further to a world that pre-dates calendars and any widely agreed upon measurement tools at all.  How do you define the length of your life then if not by the experiences and novelty you have accrued?  Is it possible this is why Noah was said to have lived the equivalent of 950 years in the Old Testament?
Like I say, our experience of time is subjective.  This is why waiting 15 minutes in a long, boring queue can *feel* like an hour.  The trick is figuring out how to get into that same mental state without being 'bored'!  We do that by taking on new novelty and figuring out how we might escape the phenomenon known as ['Hedonic Adaptation']( through the realisation there is no such thing as 'happy', 'sad', 'bored', 'excited'... when we are truly content there is nothing to 'look forward' to, every moment is then experienced and appreciated to its fullest in the present.
"The moment one gives close attention to any thing, even a blade of grass it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself." - Henry Miller
So too can each day of your life become that blade of grass given sufficient attention to each moment.
There's a [lovely explanation of some of this from Alan Watts](
"Time is a social institution and not a physical reality. There is no such thing as time in the natural world - the world of stars and waters, clouds, mountains and living organisms. There is such a thing as rhythm - rhythm of tides, rhythm of biological processes... There is rhythm and there is motion. Time is a way of measuring motion."
Your brainwaves and the organic substrate they run on are just as much a part of this natural world.  They know nothing of the unnatrual manmade alarm clock sat on your bedside table, and there is nothing in the natural world that says the neurons in your brain have to obey or be ordered by it.

"Darkness" not chaos (that would be closer to the deity Apep) but, yup.  
Kek need not necessarily be seen as a malevolent force, rather the God that brings in the last 'age' before a new dawn for humankind.  This particular epoch may be known as the era of the passing of greed, as prophesied by Charlie Chaplin in his [great dictator speech]( a video and and set of ideas that went viral in 2011 after anonymous released a remixed version to the world.
Remember that memes (in the original sense of the word which was first coined by Richard Dawkins IIRC) are just 'ideas' passed on from one brain to another.  
Cigarette smoking was a meme, as were smartphones; ideas that went viral...  We even see memes taking hold in the animal kingdom — crows, for instance, took to cracking nuts under the wheels of passing traffic, which then spread through their populations.

Agreed. But the tricky part is establishing 9 years of trust and getting it to the point where no leaders are required.
In order to bootstrap it, you need a leader with a clear vision. In bitcoin's case, Satoshi.  In the case of ethereum, Vitalik.  Bitcoin cash, Roger and Jihan.
None of that can be easily done with anonymou/pseudonymous participants like bitcoin managed because of that trust issue.  That pseudonymity is incredibly important because it means egos can't take over to the point where we end up in a "yes, master" scenario.
Satoshi walking away is what really sets bitcoin apart.  The ecosystem was truly left in charge of its own destiny without any founders (like Satoshi) having a sense of ownership.
The problem nearly all alts face is that 9 year trust transition that enabled true decentralisation of participants and all the goodwill and working relationships that have developed over that period.
Ironically, it may be blockstack built on bitcoin that fixes all that, allowing pseudonymous participants to prove the trust they've earned in the community without sacrificing their real world identify to a new project.  Of course, it still doesn't make up for 9 years of 'getting to know you' via IRC and Bitcointalk.  I mean some people have been together working on this for most of their adult life.
All of this begs the question, if it's so hard to mimick what bitcoin did organically, why try to compete at all when there's so much opportunity on layer 2 for many of the 'blockchain' ideas out there?
Going that route cuts out loads of concerns, like the security and management of your new blockchain idea.  Leaving teams free to focus on the more innovative ideas, safe in the knowledge the base layer will take care of itself.

Critical thinking is recognising that both 'experts' here have bias and neither are qualified to genuinely prognosticate on a space where the *actual* real experts (too busy building the future to speculate on it in media interviews) are honest and humble enough to conclude there are way too many variables in play right now for anybody to be able to accurately predict the future.
Ever mindful of the [Gell-Mann amnesia effect] ( everytime I see something like this, I take a mental note of the 'expert', the journalist, and the publication and ensure I accredit little worth to anything else that comes out of those networks.

Beautifully put.  
We can take solace in knowing all this happened before during the dotcom boom and bust which led to tens of thousands of graduates losing their newly acquired web development jobs, only to end up having to do lowly tech support roles and (in my case) even secretarial work before we could separate the wheat from the chaff :p
The good news from all that is none of the skills and experience were lost and, in many cases (such as my own) necessity lead to a lot of those jobless web developers starting their own companies and startups from nothing, without needing the 'permission' of VC's to bankroll them in their endeavours.  
It was actually a really fun and interesting time; many of us took to going back to IRC chatrooms and got on with the real important business of properly shaping the internet from the underground grassroots places it all started... witnessing the birth, and helping to evolve things like Napster and Bittorrent whilst we had to do our laborious 9-5 tech support day jobs :p 
It is my hunch this is exactly what we'll see when these 'blockchain' devs jump ship to work on open source Layer 2 projects that will prove to be as groundbreaking as Napster and Bitorrent.  And, like those of us who made up the first of the digital nomads, those devs coming up with those ideas will realise they can work (and play) on them from anywhere in the world, in their own time and at their own pace without being chained to a corporation breathing over them or VC's admonishing them for not hitting 'performance targets'.

Stress tests are good.  If they're gonna' have issues, better they find out sooner than later when it's live traffic.
We should try to avoid schadenfreude: rise above the petty tribalism and remember that despite our differences we have far more in common with bitcoin cashers than we do differences... and there are much bigger foes we share in common who would love to see *all* crypto fail.  More we infight, the more ammo we give those foes.

The issue is trying to force people to change too quickly.  
Not everyone grew up with unfettered access to the internet and know what we know.
It's like Veganism; obviously the world needs to get there, but it's going to take time for the old chauvinisms to pass just as it did with civil rights, gay marriage and all other massive social progress we've made since WWII.
Same with bitcoin and the near decade we've all dedicated to looking at economy, sociology and technology in a new way that's going to require a lot of assumptions about the world be unlearned.  In fact, that's what we're already seeing because no-one is reading newspapers and old-world articles that exist only to drive clicks (and money) to the old media moguls.  Why do that when the crowd itself can direct to the source via twitter and check everything being said via Wikipedia?
We can hope that when an internet is no longer powered by advertising (which is what lightning is set to do), basic critical thinking skills will see massive societal change through fact based reasoning happen at a rate we've never seen before.  Roll in quality content being rewarded by the crowd via micro transactions and with it, humanity's greatest escape from the dark age of ignorance and tribalism since the Renaissance ;)
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:58:28
I think what many who weren't there don't yet understand is that the internet as it was originally envisioned was never supposed to be a tool to carry on 'business as usual'.  Nor was it ever supposed to be powered by advertising.  A dark art that now decides the fates of our democracies.
People caught up in the blockchain hype are the exact same crowd of middlemen that pulled the internet into a dark zero sum world via that silly "a million dollars ain't cool, you know what's cool? A billion dollars" dotcom 'billionaire immortals' club.
What was always the missing link was a way for those original quiet denizens of the internet - who got involved for the right reasons - to move micropayments around the web to reward quality content.  Bitcoin is the culmination of over two decades of their discussions working toward the realisation of that dream.
And now.  The quiet ones are coming home.

The fact that 90% of the things you are trying keep failing tells us there is something wrong with the way you are doing things, leaving plenty of room for improvement... regardless whether we have yet invented a better solution to measure against.
So this is really about saying, how do we stop putting band aids on that gaping wound and address the root problem that leads to 90% of the things we're doing being a complete waste of human energy?  
That root problem is we have a lot of people who know nothing about technology creating monetary barriers for those that do in order they might make quick money to further put their feet up without asking if they're actually making the world a better place along the way.
There is, however, plenty of light on the horizon... Y-Combinator broke the mould by concentrating less on profit motive and more on nurturing good people... It wasn't even necessarily the startup ideas they cared about as much as the integrity of the people they took onboard.  AirBnB was a terrible idea until Paul Graham threw a few "what ifs?" at them.
As a result of that mentorship they have built a world class alumni of people driven by the idea of making the world a better place through technology and completely changed the landscape of the internet.
The open source renaissance coming through GitHub and the army of volunteers working on projects like bitcoin and lightning are more examples of how people in love with an idea are better motivated through the act of the creation itself than a carrot being dangled by a VC.  And, of course, how the collective wisdom and collaborative nature of the crowd itself is a far better environment than going up to a board of predatory investors wrapping all your ideas in NDAs and patents before you can even get to work.
Time will tell how unleashing egalitarian access to crowd based funding frameworks like ICOs (that require no stamp of approval from middlemen) will change that 9/10 metric.

You're encrypting an offline seed with an elaborate passphrase.  You're decrypting (also offline) with said passphrase.  
A dictionary attack is therefore highly implausible, as the attacker is going to have no idea what data you've encrypted the seeds against.  Heck, simply prepending the song data with a weak password you're never going to forget would render that particular attack vector virtually impossible.
And all you have to do is remember a choice song / book / movie scene / codepen page / photograph etc.

Exactly, do you see how you're listening to a scientist explaining the truth as it is today?  At the moment bitcoin is a store of value.  Just as 
web 1.0 at the beginning was a cool way of connecting images and information but was not yet ready for things like video streaming (although we could see it would be with more development).
So... As Andreas explains when he says "yes, I believe it can become currency when it can scale via Layer 2 technology" he is explaining what is going to happen when things like Lightning Network (which came from those [clever scientists at MIT]( can eventually move billions of transactions per second around at close to zero cost.
Lightning has just gone into beta and is already performing far better than anyone expected after just a year of development.  
Of course these teething issues aren't anything we haven't all been aware of and anticipating (hence all the work going on in MIT).  
Indeed, way back in 2013 Facebook executive and Social+Capital Fund partner Chamath Palihapitiya explained exactly how all of this was going to unfold and was absolutely correct.


"I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fund, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. Because what you're talking about right now is **for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right?** The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government. **It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina. Everywhere you have currency pressure.** Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. **And then, after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism.**"
See: [Facebook Executive says Bitcoin Is Gold 2.0 - It's a Huge, Huge, Huge Deal!](
Lightning is the 'payment mechanism' part Chamath predicted would arrive.

Very cool, but I think you're needlessly complicating things...  A far better way IMO is to encrypt it all against something already in the public domain.  This could be a hash made from the lyrics of your favourite song, a page of text from a memorable book or even the raw image data of a photo that means a lot to you that's hiding in plain sight on imagur or your own social media / email account.
If you want to get really cypherpunk about it all, you might even embed data into a song or podcast that you've uploaded to YouTube or Google drive that can only be revealed when passed through a spectrogram (in the same way aphex twin embedded the double helix into the song [window licker]( ;)

I think anyone secretly hoping cataclysmic events in old world markets will suddenly propel bitcoin into the stratosphere, will be sorely disappointed.  Such events would be bad all round.  
I do not foresee a swift 'pulling of the rug' on that old system; rather, gradual change as old ways of profiting through greed becomes less and less tenable and institutions propping up those markets lose credibility as old world 'experts' give way to those scientists and engineers who have been tasked with rebuilding the broken systems they've inherited.
In that sense, it's more like that scene in Fight Club "it's called a changeover; the movie goes on and noone in the audience notices a thing."
At least, that's what we should be hoping for.  The alternative is the same chaotic fear and anger that gripped ordinary, good folk, during the 2008 crisis.  
I like to think we've evolved as a species in the last decade; thanks, in large part, to the things younger generations have been teaching us about how to better get along and move toward a more collaborative economy.

Just so you know, I've been in this space since the very early days and was already financially independent when I arrived.  I have built many things on the internet (for free to help non profits) and I hold very little bitcoin.  Indeed, in the early days I gave most away to friends and good causes.  I care very little about the price.
The first thing I did for bitcoin was integrate it for a non profit in 2012 - for free - without asking for any of the (many) bitcoins they raised in return.
I am a computer scientist and social activist who fell in love with this technology.  I see it as the only sane solution for reducing the insane corporate greed that lead to the 2008 crisis...  and the only thing capable of reducing the inequality that has driven humanity so very close to the cliff edge.
I, like many academics concerned with those things, have been heavily influenced by books such as [The Spirit Level: why more equal societies almost always do better]( and have been thinking of little else for the last 8 years.

Sure.  It's all related.  Indeed, Deus Ex merely added to the groundswell in that underground calling for revolution.  
One of the most viral underground documentaries that came out in January 2011 was Peter Joseph's magnificent [Zeitgeist: Moving Forward](
 which ends with the words ["The Revolution is Now"]( which has since attracted some 24m views and kick-started the ZMF movement that joined occupy in 2011.  That documentary inspired a lot of computer scientists (such as myself) to begin thinking about what a decentralised 'world computer' keeping track of all resources might begin to look like.
The rise of the hacktivist collective Anonymous (also calling for revolution) played a major part of course, as did the [Arab Spring revolution]( in January of that year, which was the spark that kicked off Occupy in Europe (leading to some 250 camps at one juncture).
[*That* poster]( helped too.
Of course, all our wise elders working in the light behind the scenes witnessed all this [the last time it happened](

It's important newcomers to this space understand that bitcoin does not exist in technological stasis.  This requires educating yourself about the nascent capabilities of the current Layer 1 infrastructure.

When humanity is ready to embrace the world of abundance we truly live in; when war, poverty and greed (also just engineering issues) are solved, do not be too shocked if a group like Google Calico announces we've figured out the secret to eternal life within the next few decades.

These are good points.  Same reason people invest in art of course.
What older people who haven't grown up as natives on the internet need to get their head around is the breakthrough that comes with producing true digital scarcity.  A bitcoin *is* as scarce as that rare piece of art or plot of land on the beachfront.  So too are Rarepepes and Kyrptokitties.  In fact they are arguably even more valuable than that rare art that fetches so much at Sotheby's since they can't be counterfeited. 
Just as virtual 'realestate' in the computer game SecondLife used to go at crazy prices, so too will we see this happening in VR worlds that are almost indistinguishable from 'reality'.  Indeed, we may even see the entire of Google Earth's city mapping go into VR and you'll be able to wander around completely reimagined cityscapes of your hometown or live in 'the future' or a bygone era.
What will this mean for meatspace realestate values when we have a global currency that equalises land (and everything else) value across a truly global world where the concept of global rent and global citizenship takes off... and selling/listing your house is as easy and simple as clicking the BUY/RENT NOW button?
Few people care about owning property in Germany (they'd rather rent) but what will VR ownership mean for the actual human *desire* to own property when experiencing living in a luxurious mansion in an alternative VR world is as good as the *real* thing, only arguably better as we can do this with all our friends from around the globe irrespective of location (the VR equivalent of a skype conference call).  What will it mean for the empathy we have for other nations and cultures when we can experience them virtually in realtime?
No-one yet knows the answers to these questions, but just like the nerds could envisage where IRC and FTP sharing would eventually lead, so too can we see that the conflation of all the current nascent tech advances are going to catapult us all into uncharted territory the likes of which humanity hasn't seen before.  
Which is going to mean questioning some very deeply held assumptions.  I have a gut feeling, one of those assumptions is that property has *any* value *at all* other than that which fulfils Maslow's basic needs.

Perhaps with a bunch of interesting niche alts / tokens who made their tech Layer 2 compatible running over sidechains.
Fast forward a few years to a bunch of 'Captain Hindsights' saying "can you remember all those crazy ICOs that went down with the great 'blockchain' bubble of 2019?  How could people not see how stupid it all was?  Obviously it was going to be all about Layer 2..."

We had this with the changetip bot for many years.  The team eventually closed it down and moved to AirBnB a few years back.
In order to accomplish this you need to basically do a bunch of dirty hacks and place intermediaries (like changetip) into the process, which is no good if you want a universal solution every website can implement which is capable of serving everyone on the planet.
All this will come in time through lightning (it's already feasible), but people need to be patient for the technologists in this space to get to grips with this brand new technology stack and figure out the most elegant ways of integrating in a manner that negates the need for the kind  of quick and dirty hacks we've seen in the past.
Google's unified payment API may also be an interesting way of accomplishing this in the future.

Off the top of my head:
- A new web 3.0 era Internet purged of advertising that allows 'pay what you can afford' funding models of your favourite websites.  We see early versions of this with brave and lightning payment gateways.
- Journalists and content creators freed from the yoke of media conglomerates which will see quality content rewarded by the crowd.  No more clickbait!
- VR and in-game currencies.
- Direct artist-&gt;consumer payment channels will change everything from music to high end art distribution. 
- An end to cable TV as we know it and Hollywood middlemen.  More and more projects will do direct to crowd pitches.
- An end to big pharma.  We can expect academics and researchers to be able to go direct to the crowd, much like we saw with the immunology hiv project.  Removing corporations and profit incentives will mean multiple researchers can collaborate worldwide instead of having to compete as they do currently.
- One universal login with decentralised encrypted data layers that can be used to securely store everything from your visa applications and passport data, to medical records.  This may come through blockstack / Microsoft and rolled out first to tech savvy users through GitHub (after their recent acquisition this would make a lot of sense).
- AirBnB, Google, Microsoft updating legacy data stores to enable much more fluid value transfer chains and reputation management systems that can resist Sybil attacks.
- An end to spam (calls and email).
Wouldn't exactly shock me if all houses in the future are bought and sold via an AirBnB sidechain that cuts out all the middlemen, including AirBnB itself which might end up becoming more of a basic utility service / public good.  
Perhaps the ultimate 'exit' in the future won't be whether you can sell your startup on, but whether it can be open sourced and handed over for the crowd to maintain as a public good project.  Kinda' like what happened with some railway and utility companies in the past.
We can also expect the concept of a global rent to gain traction allowing people to travel and live all over the world without needing anything but their blockstack ID.  Imagine walking into a new town and seeing an AR overlay of all the vacant places you are eligible to stay in and being able to walk straight in with a smartphone tap.
Same for Lyft.  Why buy a car when you can just walk up to an empty Lyft car, swipe your phone and pay per minute through the Lyft sidechain?  
Could eBay one day pivot into a global tradenet powered by their own sidechain directly linking producers, suppliers and consumers?  I see no reason why not.

@_date: 2019-02-12 22:07:06
You've just described organized religion and altcoins to a tee.  This is what happens when the tragedy of the commons sets in.  Even Anonymous, which originally started on 4Chan, has succumbed to this.  
The internet did too when AOLOnline lead to the 'eternal September'.  
Media broadcast that started out with a nicely structured BBC world service and no advertising lead to the saturation of Cable TV and '56 channels of American Gladiators'.  Programming nothing but 'filler' sandwiched between ads.
Law in America has been screwed up by parasitical 'no win no fee' lawyers and a two tier justice system that subverted it's noble ideals. 
Politics and governance was broken in the same way.
Facebook has entered the same phase MySpace did when that too suffered the tragedy of the commons.  
Newspapers in the desperate search for ad revenue are going through the same pain.  
Heck, there was a time where if you read every book in the library you'd be the smartest person in town.  Today, there's so much noise, you'd come out the dumbest.  Manufactured music, pop art that says nothing to the world.  It all suffers when the 'why' is lost.
A 'free speech for all' is great in theory until the biggest, loudest, dumbest bullies in the room drown out the rest and drag everyone else down with them, driving the good people out.
The solution is not censorship but better systems for filtering out the noise and teaching others basic critical thinking skills and some good old fashioned manners.  We don't fix traffic jams on the road by banning all traffic.  We build better transport systems and get people to make more efficient use of the resources. 
That will come with time off the back of AI toxicity filters and decentralised identity that marries social capital with real world economic energy.
In the meantime the best we've got for filtering the noise right now is good ol' Reddit, chiefly because each community can govern itself by a core set of principles rather than being beholden to the whims of the platform 'controllers'.
@_date: 2019-02-13 01:09:40
Depends on the platform.  4Chan has no filter; it works because of the niche crowd and esoteric subject matter.  Twitter is more complex because you have a much bigger crowd lacking crowd-lead moderation and consensus tools.
It's a design problem, just as facebook only allowing likes (not downvotes) was a major cock-up.  It creates gigantic echo chambers where trolls feed without any kind of negative feedback that IRL would come in the form of a swift punch or ban from whatever establishment they're in that comes with a few basic rules like treating others with common decency and respect.
In absence of those crowd lead vetting tools, these gigantic farms that thrive on  dopamine/cortisol release driving advertiser impressions have little recourse but to draft in teams of arbiters to decide what should or shouldn't be said... which means only the very, very worst behaviour is dealt with based on a fuzzy political correctness framework that not everyone ascribes to nor can the arbiters truly understand because these platforms are now global.
Meanwhile the very worst \*actual\* offenders (rude, ignorant and intolerant cretins messing it up for the rest) escape that filter because there's no PC framework for dealing with people who simply enjoy being rude arseholes.
So they're caught between a rock and a hard place.  Begin building better crowd vetting models and see clicks and ad revenues fall as a result, or watch the platform eventually entropy past the point of no return as an eventual replacement comes for those seeking exit.
The third way is to find a better solution for monetising outside of ads, which is exactly where lightning comes in and brings us neatly full circle to OPs original post ;)
Funnily enough I pitched my own concept not far removed from Twitter to British investors some 3 years before Twitter actually came along.  I foresaw where ad based models might lead us today and figured it would better be monetised by allowing followers to send money to people they were a fan of and for those people to be able to create their own private forum areas only for their followers.
So a kind of fusion between Patreon and Twitter.  Neither existed at the time of course.  And the investors said it was a terrible idea.
Looking back, that kind of ad-free model fused with crypto may just save twitter.  If not, we're gonna' have to leave it to AI toxicity bots to clean up the human excrement being pushed through these networks.
[ looks interesting in that regard.  It wouldn't be a case of censoring comments, just letting users themselves decide what kind of bullshit tolerance they have at any particular moment in time ;)
@_date: 2019-02-07 23:10:47
Isn't it?  Someone stumbling upon internet.com in those early days and reading about, say, Bill Gates' vision of a series of walled garden intranets which we could all see directly contradicted Sir Tim Berners-Lee's ideals, is exactly the same as far as I can see.
Ironically though, in order for Tim's vision of a free and open internet to play out we had to be absolutely okay with people like Bill doing that and refrain from stifling free speech (even if a lot of it didn't live up to scientific scrutiny or even, basic commonsense).
Otherwise we're no better than those who seek to dominate and control what other people might freely choose to think and feel - which all this was built to transcend.
In many ways the last decade has been like the religious wars of the past playing out at hyperspeed as we see various cults splinter away from the original core believers and create new sects... Sects that then experience their first flushes of power, money and internet success, get a little over buzzed by the power rush then come back to throw rocks at the very people that gave them the knowledge that set them all free.
Much like those religious wars.  Same shit, different millennium.  We're in many ways seeing the Tower of Babel story on steroids.

Remember when Charlie Chaplin wrote arguably one of the [greatest speeches of all time]( in his first talking movie and, in doing so, opposed Hitler before even the U.S. government did?
Not long after the war, during a similar Russophobic atmosphere as we're seeing in some contingents of America today, he was thrown out of the states for being a suspected communist.  
He would later state the sooner he was free of that "hate beleaguered" atmosphere the better.
Charlie was not a communist or even a socialist.  He did, however, yearn for a more equal world where every human might have the dignity of a roof over their head.  Likely because he himself was an orphan who came from the streets, and those who have experienced poverty have more empathy for those less fortunate than themselves.
The neo liberals and political dynasties that so shockingly lost power to Trump needed a scapegoat to explain their many failings.  
Far easier to explain it all away with the 'great red menace' than acknowledge that perhaps it was their lack of empathy for a deeply impoverished American working class they for years belittled and thought 'beneath' them that lead to their own downfall.
Perhaps Obama (and the neo liberal elites he surrounded himself with) who spent years mocking Trump at presidential roasts, took things a little too far...  Trump is, afterall, half Scottish and we saw what happened when the elites of their day pushed William Wallace and his roughneck pals too far.
Someone needed to remind those elites, perhaps, that the reason rednecks got their name is because they'd spend all day working the fields and building America before those elites came along and seized everything they'd toiled for.  In the absence of jobs, dignity and self worth, is it any wonder then the downtrodden would take to the dark corners of the internet to stage a revolt?  
Would they not rally around the only guy who was not only prepared to acknowledge they ought have a voice, but also seemingly very much cared about the plight of their way of life and the country they so loved?  Afterall, Obama himself acknowledged that he could not doubt for a moment Trump genuinely cares about America.
So then one only has to look at how Pepe the Frog and KEK developed via 4chan to see that the grassroots working class movement Trump galvanised was nearly all homegrown and could not possibly have been orchestrated by a foreign adversary; nor would that adversary have had any power to do so if the message itself hadn't resonated with ordinary people en masse.  
There ain't a think tank or intelligence agency on Earth twisted enough to come up with the idea of resurrecting an ancient Egyptian 'God of Darkness' called KEK that also happens to be a frog (and the Orcish WoW translation for Lol).  
That special kind of twisted requires the same kind of Lulzy geek hivemind that came up with the [Pools Closed prank]( aeons ago.  And that came from American 4Chan users not Russia or Britain or any other place.
Of course, when Obama took the establishment by surprise and the organic grassroots internet movements (like Funny or Die) and Hollywood celebs got behind him in the exact same manner, Obama was just seen as 'clever' and ahead of his time.
Whereas when Trump (who has no interest in politics and is essentially an establishment outsider that is neither democrat or republican) did the same thing, well then surely it must have been a red menace pulling the strings!  How soon we forget those times that lead to witch-hunts of good, honest people like Charlie Chaplin leaving America because of people's inability to look in the mirror and take responsibility for their own failings.
Heck, it doesn't even matter where those Hillary emails came from any more than the sources of whistleblowers during the Watergate scandals mattered.  What *does* matter is whether the information that came to light is true and how ordinary Americans feel about it.
In times like these it's a good idea to step outside the propaganda machines and 'he said she said' gossip peddlers and go directly to the source material... then try make your own mind up.
The best material we have at joining the dots on this one in as unbiased way as possible is a series of interviews American movie director Oliver Stone did with Putin over a few years in the run-up to the Trump election whilst he was over in Russia filming the Snowden movie.
For further sanity, you might also want to check out Hypernormalisation by Adam Curtis.
Russell Brand's under the skin podcasts, Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson are also offering some rare insights into world events outside of the left/right echo chamber of MSM that can help those of us feeling lost in the noise find some semblance of balance.
Ultimately though, outside of politics there is much to be positive about in our future.  We simply all need to get a bit better at thinking for ourselves and be ok confronting some uncomfortable truths that, in the long run, will make everyone (on left and right) a little more confident in our ability to fix things by ourselves.

Hahaha.  Well I mean they'll probably use A.I. to strip the noise out but the bitcoin Reddit will almost certainly be part of history books.  
There were a few posts on here, in the early days especially, that changed things in pretty profound ways.  
It was also pretty much the only point of contact for anyone in media to figure out WTF was going on as there were very few experts out there beyond here and Bitcointalk.  
I'm wondering if people like AmericanPegasus and a few other old characters will eventually 'come out' and appear in documentaries in the future, like the old bletchley park crew did after decades of anonymity.  Be fun to watch the Pineapple Fund story told by the creator for instance.  
Then again, people in the future may be so engaged actually living life in the world of abundance this all gives rise to...  they'll be too busy actively creating the new world to feel the need to look back to the past. 
Luckily though, it will all be there on the immutable ledger of human history should they ever need it.

That's like saying "we need to start again with email because people have started using imperfections within the protocol to send spam.  The fact that a Microsoft intranet developer found this spam threat just adds further fuel to Bill's argument that an open internet cannot work."
Indeed, had we seen how the internet would evolve we certainly would have designed the internet protocol somewhat differently.  We would also have devised different book publishing and copyright protocols that were later exploited as a result of the invention of the printing press if we go back far enough in the history of breakthrough communication technologies that bought the world closer together.
Bitcoin, like that printing press and the internet that followed is here to stay.  It's imperfect and chaotic just like art, music, books, legal frameworks, political governance and real world currency.  We don't simply throw out the constitutional frameworks that bind us together because of exploits and imperfections - we figure out how to fix and augment those frameworks in novel ways that meet the challenge of the ever changing mileau of the modern world. 
Bitcoin's ability to thrive amidst all that chaos in all its imperfect perfection is a feature, not a bug, and testament to it's greatest strength: anti fragility through radical openness. 
As the ecosystem and infrastructure around that openness learns to walk more confidently, the technology will further evolve and get better at immunising itself against external shocks, just like the very imperfect human beings that built and use it all amidst the chaos that is mother nature have learnt to evolve as their environment and needs change.
That's how the creators of all this (and indeed the creators of the internet) predicted this would all play out nearly a decade ago, and it's how it will play out over the next decade too.

But hey, the collective American society which produced that (and many other) hats is only a little over a few hundred years old based on an unchanging 'founders vision' whitepaper that subsequent generations erroneously conflated with a Christian religion that pervaded governance models in the exact same way the two factions of Islam did.  Meanwhile those other new kids on the block Israel aren't much over half a century old.  Those young upstart nations are up against ancient civilisations with thousands of years of art, culture, history and - most importantly - stupid mistakes in their collective memories, which barely makes those upstarts much more than toddlers on the global civilisation building stage.

If you've been around that long you must surely know there's way too many variables now to say with any kind of authority what the market is going to do.
The best way to encourage the right kind of long-term adoption bitcoin now needs is through being honest and responsible; which means not trying to set people into a FOMO mindset because of your own vested self interest, but by simply being patient and admitting to people the truth: you, like everyone else, have no idea what the price is going to do next.

None of this is helping; by revelling in the drama, all we do is give more oxygen to those false idols (on both 'sides') who get an adrenaline kick from the braying masses cheering them on.
At this point, they're no longer 'debates', it's a series of car crashes set to the Jerry Springer show.  
And yet science and progress marches on and gives not one hoot about this nonsense.  
My humble advice then: stop wasting time on 30 minute slices of ego driven entertainment, and spend that time learning about things you care about.
Then be confident enough in your knowledge to be able to think for yourself.  
That road starts when we stop worshipping false idols who don't know the first thing about technology, computer science and the very complex socio economic issues bitcoin was built to address.

Prompted by this post, I just learnt a heck of a lot reading [the wiki]( on this.  Fascinating to think that future generations who will take Bitcoin for granted as something that 'just is' will be as ignorant of its beginnings as I was to the British Pound.  In fact, in just 9 short years I have seen vast swathes of newcomers arriving in here with very little knowledge of Bitcoin's humble beginnings, so I guess that historical amnesia is already happening.
A fun takeaway from the wiki: *In the Great Recoinage of 1816, the guinea was replaced by the* ***pound*** *as the major unit of currency, and in coinage by the sovereign. Even after the guinea coin ceased to circulate, the name guinea was long used to indicate the amount of* ***21 shillings*** *(£1.05 in decimalised currency).*
Coupled with The Times (London) genesis block message, could it be Bitcoin was the second 'Great Recoinage' and the 21m figure is in homage to the Guinea?  Beautiful historical synchronicity either way ;)

Hmmmm.  Well... lightning isn't Bitcoin.  Email has a different 'logo' to the internet it's built on (which doesn't really have one) that is instantly recognisable to users but has no real hard defined logotype beyond a letter symbol...
I would say the emoji works perfectly and is already in widespread use on Twitter screennames etc.  If you want to associate it with bitcoin at say, a merchant that accepts lightning, then perhaps the bitcoin logo with the emoji neatly overlayed inside a circle to the bottom right of the B if you want to standardise things?  Figure it's up for lightning Devs to figure that out in the slack channel if they wanna' start creating "lightning accepted" material for merchants.  If you're keen on this why not join their group and make suggestions?

Nice imagination but on a choppy ocean you'd never be able to get the dish aligned, as you'd require a static mount point.  This is why you have to hire specialist installation engineers to meticulously align your cable TV satellite dish to the nth degree, even when on land. 
Far better to rely on the microwave dish most marine vessels have to connect you to the cell phone network, where you can monitor a website or simply wait for an SMS to arrive.  Even monitoring shortwave marine radio for a coded message or waiting for a flare to be sent from a conspirator on land would make far more sense.

The transparent nature of the bitcoin global public ledger means **Bitcoin would be *the* most retarded technology for the organised criminal class to attempt to hide illicit transactions behind.**  
As evident with the Silkroad story, law enforcement have ample ability to perform blockchain analysis and, unlike closed-loop banking systems, can do so in real-time without getting stonewalled or needing to spend millions on covert infiltration operations.  Nor can company paper shredders or delete buttons be used to erase the paper trail, on account of the bitcoin blockchain being immutable.
It's also likely we'll see decentralised civilian-led public ledger analysis and intel teams in a similar way to how groups on 4Chan have helped police and intelligence on investigations in the past.  Like the time the 4Chan crowd helped bring that evil [cat bin lady]( to justice :D

The answer to bad speech is more speech.  Banning them would just give more reason for the lesser angels of bitcoin's nature to cry foul and play the martyr card.  
Although Satoshi didn't care much about the .com, in hindsight perhaps bitcoiners should have all been faster to secure it alongside Twitter handles and YouTube accounts in order to avoid a brand hijacking situation.  C'est La Vie - as it stands the entire debacle can be construed as a stress test (in more ways than one :p) and is actually a pretty healthy state of affairs to be in overall.

Weird bi-polar world we find ourselves in.  
On the blue stage we have Millennial Wikileakers who want to smash down the old world and inspire global revolt.  Which would eventually lead to a Lord of the Flies style breakdown in societal structures and a total systemic collapse.
Over on the red stage we have Boomer Craig who wants to reinforce those systems of old world control and cocoon everyone in big business / big gov surveillance and red tape, using the fear of anarchy and promise of fools gold as a carrot to woo the 'powerful'.  Anyone who has studied history can see that type of thinking would lead to everyone being implanted with an RFID chip and the total enslavement of humanity.
Neither will have their way for as long as the good and honest who see that bipolar trap continue to work together and act as countervailing forces in the middle of all this.
It seems the world is in the last throes of dizzying chaos for this particular period in the human survival story.  The people that work nicely alongside each other for the good of the *entire group* will eventually prevail, and a more peaceful order will once again be restored.  Just as those that prevailed during civil rights, the anti Vietnam war movement and last cold war succeeded - through relentless collaboration - in ushering in more harmonious times after previous periods of uncertainty and chaos.
Perhaps when we reach that newfound calm, our outspoken Aussie crypto pals Julian and Craig can finally take off their pantomime masks, step off the stage and go live out their retirement years over on that old abandoned pineapple farm Julian grew up on... knowing they played an important role in the Yin/Yang struggle that kept the rest of us on our toes.

If you focus on price maybe.  
If you focus on technology, altcoins have proven to be the best way to *protect* bitcoin:
*Alts relieve burden on the mempool.*
If all that speculation frenzy during major price run ups was restricted solely to the bitcoin blockchain, things would be very messy right now.
*Alts give the core dev team more room to breathe.*
Different groups with alternative ideas that are not congruent with the core roadmap are free to go experiment with niche uses of the technology instead of 'fighting it out' and slowing progress on BTC.  There can be no doubt that lots of great ideas and brilliant teams are being born in the alt space right now.  
*Alts reduce external pressures.*
Since the genie is out of the bottle, there is no longer a single entity or group that can be targeted by those who would want to throttle the technology.
Will most of those alternative teams/ideas end up adopting layer 2 tech once the 'blockchain all the things!' hype settles down and bitcoin's scaling solutions mature?

If you are going to link to an article, please don't add your own words to invoke a knee-jerk response.  The piece doesn't even mention bitcoin.
Further, bitcoin is infinitely more traceable than fiat currencies due to there being a global, immutable public ledger showing the movement of funds.  Agencies and techies now have lots of fancy blockchain analysis tools for analysis purposes.
Unlike physical cash for instance, which still remains untraceable and subject to being counterfeited / flooded into the shadow economy.

The anger is due to how they handled the bitcoin Segwit upgrade and tried to strongarm the community down a path it had decided behind closed doors at boardroom meetings that neither the core developers or wider economic community consented to.  
It took nearly a year of needless 'fighting' to overcome the impasse and divided the community leading to the development of Bitcoin Cash which equally created needless division.
But whatever, the bitcoin project is about making (and learning from) the mistakes we make along the way in order that every vector of attack be battle tested.  We cannot expect to be able to create an entire new economy unless it immunises itself against these kinds of scenarios.
The valuable lesson we learnt from all that is the community has more power than miners and big business when it comes together.
Your analysis is fair.  Bitpay / Coinbase currently offer an AOL Online on-ramp that is much needed.  If those with more decentralised ideas in mind want to compete then they need to match the UX and simplicity of those services otherwise they'll only ever serve the needs of a highly select technologically literate group.
Still early days, and I'm glad 'muggles' like your good self are finding their feet in all this as Bitcoin, like the internet, needs to be for everyone.

My 'case' was that some cultures do not believe colonialism was all the rainbows and lollipops you painted it as.
If you weren't so blinded by your soulless religion you'd realise they were wiped out by immigration, their cultures forever destroyed. 




Errr last I checked, most people weren't that enamoured with coming to America, in fact the biggest problem America faces is migration of some of it's smartest brains leaving in their droves, which is higher than it's ever been.  Roger Ver is one such example of an American renouncing his citizenship.  So there aren't long lines of 'settlers' or invading armies desperate to get into America, no matter what fairtytales elites in charge may be telling you to prop up their scapegoating.


Get your facts like please if you want an adult discussion.  
*In 2015, the International Telecommunication Union estimated about 3.2 billion people, or almost half of the world's population, would be online by the end of the year. Of them, about 2 billion would be from developing countries, including 89 million from least developed countries.* [Source: 
In addition, there are 2 billion people now connected with facebook accounts which accounts for 27% of the global population.
The rest of the world will smother that generation with pure numbers, poverty, and war.
It's clear you exist in a privileged bubble. I've actually seen the rest of the world and those people are not intent on joining hands and singing peace songs. 




No-one actually cares for moving to the US all that much under the current regime.  Why would they in such a hostile and unfriendly environment?


I would argue Britain and the "Common Wealth" through their recognition of the idea that it was possible all countries and cultures could live as one, have done far more to enable progress.  I would also argue that [the military industrial complex]( that Dwight Eisenhower warned against has actually done more to STYMIE progress for much of the world since WWII.
I'll leave you with a thought from the great American scientist and inventor Jaques Fresco:
"When I was a young man, growing up in New York City, I refused to pledge allegiance to the flag. Of course I was sent to the principal's office and he asked me: "Why don't you want to pledge allegiance? Everybody does." I said: "Everybody once believed the Earth was flat but, that doesn't make it so." I explained that America owed everything it has to other cultures and other nations, and that I would rather pledge allegiance to the Earth and everyone on it. 
Needless to say, it wasn't long before I left school entirely. I set up a lab in my bedroom. There, I began to learn about science and nature. I realized then that the universe is governed by laws, and that the human being, along with society itself, was not exempt from these laws. Then came the crash of 1929, which began with what we now call "The Great Depression." 
I found it difficult to understand why millions were out of work, homeless, starving, while all the factories were sitting there, the resources were unchanged. It was then that I realized that the rules of the economic game were inherently invalid. Shorty after came World War II, where various nations took turns, systematically destroying each other. 
I later calculated that all the destruction and wasted resources spent on that war could've easily provided for every human need on the planet. Since that time, I've watched humanity set the stage for its own extinction. I have watched as the precious, finite resources are perpetually wasted and destroyed in the name of profit and free markets. 
I have watched the social values of society be reduced into a base artificiality of materialism and mindless consumption. And I have watched as the monetary powers control the political structure of supposedly "free societies." I'm 94 years old now and I'm afraid my disposition is the same as it was 75 years ago: this shit's got to go."

They will be further propped up by institutions and investors with integrity who are excited by the science of all this and what it means for humanity.  
There is no 'winning' move those who have missed the point of the technology can make against a global populace that are going to be elevated out of poverty through all this.

You ain't gonna get consensus at a closed door meeting in meatspace mate.  Especially when none of core were even there (because they're spread out all over the world, some at university campuses from Tokyo and Hong Kong to London and MiT, actually studying computer science whilst they help peer-review all this).  
And also, because the 200+ coders behind this, prefer to conduct conversations in open, transparent forums like IRC and mailing lists so everyone in this space can go back over discussions to see why certain decisions were made.  
This is the essence of open systems peer-review and it's a standard thing on science projects of this magnitude.  Indeed, it's why we take things like meetings minutes and make them available to governments and publicly accountable bodies and institutions.
Great if you think doing it at a board meeting and then going out for coke and champers is a better way to conduct the business of securing the world's most secure blockchain (that millions of ordinary people are going to be putting their hard earned wealth in).  
But that's a big turn off for greying neckbeards such as myself — we've seen all that before — and it's what nearly broke the internet (and Wall Street).  
I would also hazard a guess, it's a big turn off for ordinary hardworking people *and* the huge institutions who are now looking at jumping onboard.  Not to mention all those people in places like Venezuela who right now just need to know the value they are entrusting with us with bitcoin is secure and safe.

Try telling that to native indians, [aboriginals]( or the [stolen generations](  Fortunately the internet generation have grown up in a world without borders where they don't see age, skin colour, or religion as a barrier to communication and the sharing of knowledge.

You can usually see the transaction pretty much instantly.  It's confirmations of that transaction that takes 10mins+.  
There are many scenarios where confirmation isn't strictly necessary (paying friends and family, paying a bar / cafe bill as you wait for food to be prepared and so on).  
There are even some bitcoin ATMs that work on 0 confirmations.
Regardless, Layer 1 will evolve as a settlement layer with lightning, liquid and other instant Layer 2/3 solutions bolted on to serve the needs of more advanced use cases (such as micro and nano payments).
Just as the internet had to evolve via new layers built on top of IPv4 to serve the needs of those wishing to use the internet for things like FTP, video and music streaming which could not be handled at scale through the base IP layer.  Indeed, email itself is a set of protocols built on top of IP to solve the need for mass communication transit, just as lightning is built on top of bitcoin to solve the needs of mass payment transit.

Makes more sense to compare the Bitcoin (with a big B) **protocol** to protocols that came before, such as the internet.  It was the dotcom bubble we experienced, not the hyper text transport protocol bubble.  Had Tim Berners-Lee patented the world wide web and IPO'd, holding internet protocol 'stocks' (HTTP) would be comparable to what we all experience today holding Bitcoin protocol 'stocks' (BTC).  And, of course, those early internet HTTP stocks would have seen the same meteoric rise in price, despite all the internet doubters during those early years.
With that understanding we can then look to bitcoin infrastructure bubbles (ICO's, Altcoins, Vaporware blockchains, VC backed ventures and exchanges) that are running in step with what we experienced with the dotcom rush.  There will be winners and losers there, for sure, but the base bitcoin protocol 'stock' remains the glue that holds it all together.  We witness this every time we see billions rush into bitcoin from the alt coin market whenever there is a shake-up.
We cannot therefore compare Bitcoin to myspace or facebook in that context.  We can, however, compare VC backed ventures built on the Bitcoin protocol (such as exchanges, user services, 'blockchain' ventures) to those early internet companies (AOL Online, Myspace, Pets.com).  
Those companies entering this nascent space today that embrace and pivot their existing infrastructure and business models to adopt Web 3.0 opportunities (Lightning, Blockstack, Rootstock) have a bright future just as those companies like Facebook and Google thrived by adopting and capitalising on the shift from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 early on in the first major evolution of world wide web technological capabilities circa 2006. 
TL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol comparable to the world wide web; dotcoms (and the bubble it lead to in the 90's) are comparable not to Bitcoin, but rather the supporting Bitcoin infrastructure developments that utilise the protocol (e.g. exchanges, apps, hardware).

Remember money is not the same as wealth.  We may be witnessing the greatest egalitarian global *value* redistribution in history, but that will not equate to *real* wealth until we see that value being pushed into projects and ideas capable of freeing humanity from the spectre of artificial scarcity that has so long held us back as a species.  
We'll get there.  Money (value), afterall, is a trivial unit of account to measure and was relatively simple to fix once the double spend problem had been cracked.  It's just a bunch of digital tally sticks in the end ain't it ;)
Trustful networks that can scale horizontally and operate in a permissionless manner - now that's the real exciting challenge that bitcoin has to tackle, so that all this value can actually be equated with *real* wealth creation and distribution.

Well an emergency proof of work change would brick all those miners.  
Note that [Blankfein's comments today]( touch upon the importance of consensus in the 'new world'.  
At the end of the day, if big institutions are going to be storing their wealth in bitcoin they are going to need the assurance of knowing that the protocol is properly peer-reviewed and that the core focus is *always* the security of the funds they are moving in there.
When massive tech corporations like Microsoft have already sided with Core alongside the majority of silicon valley scientists and academia, you can be sure of one thing: B2X offers none of the security and peace of mind needed to see sensible, well planned institutional investment in this nascent science project.

People find it hard to conceptualise that there are some free agents in this world that take no 'sides' and do their best to obey what they perceive to be the moral law even if this clashes with widely held belief systems.
Charlie Chaplin eventually left America after the masses turned on him for being a suspected 'socialist'.  
He was no such thing of course; people just have the tendency to label those who have ideas that don't fit the normative social influence.  This makes them feel more at ease if they don't have to be the black sheep in the herd questioning the predominant social conditioning of the time.  And yet it is really only those black sheep rebelling against their programming able to unlock the gates for the rest of the herd.  Satoshi was one such black sheep (read: free agent) of course.

Yes and no.  What we're seeing is wealth dispersal to a different *demographic* of people.  The very very early holders were of course radicals and computer nerds in love with technology who have for a long time been thinking very deeply about how we create a more just and equal world (they are from the same 'sharing is good' and 'information wants to be free' school of philosophy that built the internet after all).  
There's also those that sat around (old and young) soaking up tons of information about the monetary system and what lead to the 2008 crash.  These were the early wave of hardcore 'believers' that have been propping all this up from the various shocks bitcoin has had to absorb over the years.  Second wave, were businessmen and women new to the internet, some of whom got carried away in the after parties and glittery things that came from experiencing their first flushes of success in business (which is fine)...
Third wave the old financial incumbents, politicians, and more experienced VC's looking to capitalise on the space in much the same way businesses moved into the internet in the 90s.
But ultimately, it's all about the many ordinary citizens in the middle of those waves who onboarded as an Exit from a system they had no chance of finding social mobility in.  Everywhere from Venezuela to kids in impoverished 1st world urban neighbourhoods that had very little prospects because of the decaying system of debt that old world is now incapable of bailing the average citizen out of.
The beauty of bitcoin is that the 'information wants to be free' bunch that have been thinking about this tech for some twenty years, know that all of this is just about code, and the transformative tools and systems we build with that code that will enrich the lives of others.   
They can see a future without speculation whereby the global crowd will have full control over where public money is spent without the need for anything but the consensus of the crowd itself to make incredible things happen, outside the purview of gatekeepers guessing at the optimal solutions and without the need to ask for 'permission'.
Those that don't see that longterm picture, will get caught up in the adrenaline fuelled speculation, throwing money at alts and ICO's...  And that's OK, since it's a rather beautiful way of chipping away at the disparity of wealth that exists presently and ensuring a more egalitarian distribution of BTC gets to those that need it most and those who are more cognitively equipped to do the most good when nurturing this technology moving forward.

The end goal for bitcoin is a world of abundance and a resource based economy where 1 BTC = 1 BTC.  It would mean a world at peace and a new human narrative that sees us once again exploring the great unknown.  Both in outer-space and inner-VR worlds of our own creation.  Not to mention just travelling the entirety of this beautiful planet of ours and experiencing the astronaut overview effect through civilian space travel.


Absolutely disagree.  That only works in a zero-sum survival of the fittest scenario where we see the world as a competitive race where we compete for mates, resources, social standing...
When we collectively realise [life is not a race]( and may be collaborative, and then it is the journey and satisfaction we get out of service to others and the group 'mission' as a whole that gives purpose.

How do you define users exactly?  It's pretty clear the vast majority of users (and scientists) reject NYA and BTC1 already.  But it appears a small group of miners and businessmen and women think they can decide the fate of the network and speak for all users via a closed door business meeting without even as much as consulting them.  The audacity and hubris is actually laughable at this point.
If they had done this respectfully, then they would have put together a series of questionnaires as LukeDashJr did via the coinbase KYC API to get a feel from the wider community as to what should be in the 'agreement'.  They could have acknowledged that without the scientists and engineers most familiar with the code base being present at the meeting, they had no right to dictate or make firm decisions in their absence, especially if it broke consensus.  But they didn't.
As for code changes and users rejecting them.  
The vast majority of users do not understand or read code.  I am personally against Jeff doing a callback to bitpay servers in the BTC1 client since that opens a whole can of worms and poses a huge conflict of interest, yet it's there.  The vast majority of the industry are against going ahead without replay protection.  But it's there.  
God knows what would end up in there if they actually did manage to take control of the client.  
You see, it doesn't matter if we're against those things, any more than it mattered the vast majority of scientists, users and the wider community were against NYA.  As long as miners in cahoots with Jeff's 'team' run his software with profit incentives for businesses he has a stake in always in the back of his mind... the feelings and opinions of users mean very little.  Which *does* give those maintaining the code and mining cartels special powers.
But what I am really against is a tiny group of programmers and businesses with vested interests, thinking they can brute force their way in and sack a programming team comprising some 200+ people diligently performing peer-review on one another, who have carried this incredible project for the last 9 years without a single hitch. 
Is that kind of hubris beginning to sound a little familiar?  A little close to the gatekeepers and profit-driven systems of control that built that old decaying world that leads to things like the Equifax breaches?
If you can't see the slippery slope all that leads to well, that's fine with me, I'm not here to convince you or tell you how to think.
As for Bitcoin - the idea.  For me, there's very little to worry about from here on in.  
The wider community and supporting infrastructure services have spoken and, whilst it may be a little chaotic, I am quite certain that truth, science and common sense will ultimately prevail.  
I am looking forward to us finally putting this 2 year long 'debate' behind us and moving onto greater things.  And I wish all those on the B2X side the best of luck in [going their own way](

“We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors.

He tried to remember the sensation of the real sun warming his skin outside of the UV sim chambers but it seemed nothing but a half forgotten dream.  He could be grateful at least for the SV haz suits that afforded them the luxury of stepping outside of the farms.  
His thoughts were interrupted by the screeching hum of their delivery drone as it buzzed into the drop zone.
"AMZ Soylent drop for Citizen Four.  Prepare for JPM blockchain credential check." the mechanised voice called out as the infra beam began its iris scan on the father.
A jubilant Jingle emitted from the drone as the claw released the package, followed by a holographic projection of their beaming CEO who briefly hung in the air before them "Thankyou for using AMZ powered by JPM Blockchain, Citizen!" it chirped enthusiastically.
The man looked to his emaciated daughter as she pulled feverishly at the Soylent packaging, her nails ripping through the protective plastic which she flung into the rest of the rotting heaps below them. 
Glimpsing something familiar amidst the rubble he stopped for a moment as he focused on the decaying remnants of a bottle of suntan lotion.  All of a sudden that half forgotten dream of happier times on Shell Beach came rushing back...
Snapping himself away from the memory, he looked to his daughter who was eagerly gulping down her daily rations.  
He dared not tell her there was once a time, before the skies were scorched, when we could actually *feel* the sunshine.

Nor how decentralised technologies like the internet, bitorrent or bitcoin work.  
The whole *point* of all this has been in building a robust, anti-fragile network with no single point of failure where no one thing going wrong (like Mt. Gox) can take the network with it.
How many schmeckels Bitcoin is or will be 'worth' in the future will be chiefly down to how well it achieves and safeguards that robustness and, in doing so, earns the long-term trust of those opting to store their wealth in such a system.  
With each new day that passes with bitcoin still reliably doing its thing that trust only increases.

Yes.  I agree wholeheartedly :)  Which is why we need to get to a [resource based economy]( that makes sense and *truly* economises.  
The truth is we live in a world of abundance.  It was only the measurement tool we used for quantifying that abundance that was broken.
All it required to fix this, was a global computer able to keep track of the flow of human needs, resources and information.  
[This is the goal]( for bitcoin.  Turing-complete systems coming online with Layer 2 technology will see things like Rootstock, Ethereum and languages like Solidity and Simplicity give the world access to such a global resource management system.
Which gets us back to barter and *real* wealth.

The arguments don't work if you can see where this space will evolve once it truly begins to scale (for that we need second layer solutions to enable billions and then trillions of transactions per second).
Perhaps it's just because some of us have been around since the invention of home computers and tinkering with these things all our lives and remember the mistakes we made building the internet.  Perhaps it's the inter-generational clash and a need for speed vs. slow, steady progress.
The only thing that matters at this juncture is robustness and security.  Rushing ahead with forks, and doing so against the wishes of those who actually built all this, is folly.
But I'm glad we agree such a divergence is not the end of the world.

We're talking about two different types of 'criminal' classes here.  
Those that used the old financial system to hide their participation in things like blood diamonds, illegal land mines, drug cartel and weapons and human trafficking, and those ordinary citizens that feel laws prohibiting them from partaking in say, recreational drugs, are wrong and out of date.
For the latter, things like ZCash and  Monero are better than bitcoin.  For the former, bitcoin is a terrible idea.

As in biblical ages, we've arrived at the tipping point where greed has reached such epic proportions a global debt jubilee is the only thing that makes real sense so we can get on with the many things our species is capable of if the stubborn illusion that money is a 'real' thing wasn't holding everyone back.  
Such a jubilee could be jumpstarted through the minting of a bunch of [trillion dollar coins](  I don't think any rational human ought be opposed to the idea of wiping out debt and giving humanity a fresh start.
If they don't, I suspect not only will the FED collapse but so too will the EU, due to the failure of central planning authorities who are no longer able to stay relevant in the hyperconnected digital world we now live in.

Actually you just made me think of the many little things people have given me over the years that have little or no 'market' value (crystals, stones from the beach, hand-made cards, drawings, letters) and realised how much *real* value they hold through the memories they bring back.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:33:52


Exactly.  And that's how consensus works, by filtering out those ideas/solutions that are best for the whole group by enabling *everyone* within that group to have an equal share of voice.  
Things get interesting when that whole group becomes the global village with lots of working groups and 'networked states' deciding on which ideas have greatest merit outside of formal hierarchical structures.
See [Bitnation: Networked States]( and their recent Web 3.0 Pangea platform for early working releases that are delivering those solutions, some of which have already enabled the UN to register stateless citizens on the blockchain for example, in order that they may receive refugee aid and access to banking services.  
This kind of system is also what Goldman Sachs' LLoyd Blankfein was [talking about just today]( when he said "maybe in the new world something gets backed by consensual arrangement by people that agree... kinda' like what social media does."  
This kind of wisdom of crowds is also what Ed Snowden was taking about when he [tweeted]( "It was once impossible to imagine countries without Kings. A time will come when they look back and say the same of Presidents."
None of that is weird or a drastic departure from what we already have.  After all, we only have governments and elected representatives to carry out the will of the people.  If we can save a step and enable the people themselves who are best qualified and experienced in the various knowledge domains to decide on the optimal solution for the ecosystem via consensus, then the wisdom of these well informed crowds enables much much better decision making to happen in real-time, irrespective of geographical location.
What's more, the openness, immutability and transparent nature of the governing processes means all actors are incentivised to play fairly within the system, since every decision will be open to scrutiny from the wider crowd.  Much like you leave a reddit / facebook / twitter history in time that can later be traced back.

 There are a whole bunch of good independent journalists and researchers compiling stuff for bitcoin.com that are probably as against B2X and BCH as everyone else - not that these 'affiliations' should matter.  If the information appears to be accurate, and well sourced, then no need to downvote.

Any future, hyper-connected humanity would understand that by changing the present and being mindful of the cause and effect of our actions we change the future.  You do this every day without even thinking about it.  Ergo, even if we did invent time travel, we would have no reason to send messages into the past.


Any future humanity would also understand that, since everything is information, sending a message on reddit 'back in time' *would* change the past, in the exact same way a single tweet can start the Arab Spring.
TL;DR: [We are already from the future](  You get to decide right now whether you wake up tomorrow and watch the sunrise or lie under the covers.  This is how you take control of your destiny and, with it, the ideas (memes) you spread in each and every moment, that will help change the course of (future) history.

You're clearly clean to learn and open minded about all this.  r/bitcoin is probably the best place to visit each day if you're keen on filtering out the noise out there.  
There are people in here who have been on this ride since the beginning before 'blockchain' was even a word all but a few handful of people had heard of.  And you'll find it takes a great deal many months of study before things start making sense.  
In that time 'know-it-alls' will tell you this or that is or isn't going to be... Be wary of anyone (including me) telling you they know how the future is going to unfold and what you should think or feel about it.  
There are too many variables at play here for anyone to really know, including 'experts' and talking heads.  
All we can really do is stick with science and be comfortable and confident enough to think for ourselves (and be OK being wrong or simply not knowing things for certain).
Most important though, is enjoying the ride! :)

(FWIW, Here's advice I gave to someone asking earlier, take with a pinch of salt):
The technology advances and new announcements are all happening too fast in this space to be able to keep up.  Anyone that tells you this or that will or won't happen hasn't been around bitcoin very long.  We're no longer at a stage where FUDsters or talking heads ignorant of the technology can do much to shake the market.
The real surge, I think, is coming from ordinary people finding bitcoin.  This subreddit alone is increasing by 2k+ users a day and top posts here are regularly ending up in r/all which is further fuelling interest.  Coinbase adding instant buys has probably also helped.
If you are invested in bitcoin - the technology and see it as a solution to many of the world's problems as many of the techies in this space do, then there's no reason to be fixated on price, as everything happening on the Layer 2 tech side spells out an incredible future for bitcoin and related infrastructure developments.
If you're into bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme, then the best place for trading advice is r/bitcoinmarkets.  There's plenty of ways of gaming the alt market but perhaps be aware that most are junk and that, eventually, nearly all alt rivers flow back to bitcoin with, perhaps, the exception of ethereum and a few other truly interesting ones.
As for the fork, the only comparable event of this nature was the BCH fork.  Everyone expected the price to go down but the opposite happened, as people were keen to see their BCH 'dividends' (read: free money) come through.
You can be patient and wait it out or you can get excited about the future we're all building here and think about how you might help spread bitcoin awareness in your own local community and with friends or family and how the technology and community might be used to help solve problems and improve the lives of people you know.
It is that kind of outreach and passion that got us this far, and ultimately helps us ensure an even brighter future for bitcoin.
Good luck and try not to pay too much attention to 'experts' and people who think they have a handle on the roads leading to that future.  They don't, any more than you or I do.  So get used to thinking for yourself, doing your own research and making your own decisions.

Well see now and then came Muhammed in 610 AD with the Quaran who figured out what Jesus was trying to say in that Bible passage I paraphrased above, and pointed out that Jesus was a prophet.  
He also figured out that the big bad Jesus had been fighting all along was greed, usuary and human stupidity.  With those insights they embraced technology and science, created the world's first hospital, university and the concept of a welfare state with the Quaran essentially being the Bible Part 3.  
Then a Bitcoin Cash sorta' thing happened when Muhammed died, creating two factions that couldn't decide on the one true Muhammed vision.  Factions which don't even agree on the day Ramadan ought to start because one side says it's fine to evolve and use technology (telescopes) to find the new moon start date, whereas the other one argues back in the day they had to use the naked eye so should jolly well stick to that.  Similarly orthodox Christians dispute even the day Jesus was born since they think the  Gregorian calendar is nonsense.
Meanwhile the Hindus got all upset with the Bible V3 happening on their doorstep (what with their version of the truth being the oldest religion in the world)... which created a 'one true God' Vs. 'many God's' Cylon vs. Human dilemma and eventually the Brits came along in their quest to 'civilise' everyone via tea and biscuits and so they drew a big line in the middle of it all creating Pakistan... then sorta gave both sides nukes and lots and lots of bureaucracy and legal schmoo to keep everyone busy... then they created Israel after Germany got a bit too big for its boots and nearly accidentally enslaved the entire species... So relieved were those post WWII baby boomers at being alive still they decided to just start having lots of babies and watch the newly created BBC telly box thing... Figuring they'd leave it to future generations to mop up the mess through music, art, poetry, comedy, science and football... and the yet to be invented internet that would one day bring everyone together and resurrect Alan Watts via YouTube who figured all this out yonks ago.
As this chaos now reaches the 11th hour, the Buddhists over in China and Vietnam are just like sat there scratching their heads and leaving everything to the I-Ching and the cosmos whilst bonkers old English aristocratic boomers who worship a fuzzy supreme being they are yet to fully define have had to come out of retirement and are now running around the city of London holding things together via a complex series of financial instruments glued together by Dirk Gently's Holistic Hedgefund Agency whilst they extricate themselves from the EU before that too accidentally enslaves everyone, it having already toppled the birthplace of democracy with nothing but a 'meh'...  
Luckily amidst all this chaos we can rest easy knowing the nerds have everyone's backs via the neverending production line of cat memes which, ironically, were the same 'weapon' of mass cuteness distraction the Egyptians used when this last kicked off during the build-up to the last great "ooops we just accidentally burned down the library of Alexandria and the repository of all our knowledge" human stupidity shitstorm which - after a mere thousand years of dark ages - eventually lead to the enlightenment.

I see your point, but IMO we sure can have it both ways... IF we stop playing zero sum games and we all start taking responsibility for where and how we spend our economic energy.  
Problem we have had with that old system is the good guys and girls had to cheat because the bad guys and girls cheated.  And those stuck in the middle had no idea who was who.
I would say Alphabet's corporate Philosophy (an extension of Google's "Don't be evil") married with Adam Back and Austin Hill's "Can't Be Evil" network philosophy, are good starting points for everyone.
Once the struggle for survival is over, and we all realise how stupid this rigged 'game' has been and that, actually, we live in a world of abundance and no longer need to fight over resources, things start getting a lot less mental.
Of course I have no more soothsaying abilities than you do, so I'm happy to be patient and wait to see how things evolve.  None of this has to be a rush, nor do we need all the answers at once.  This is a process.
Main thing is we all get used to thinking for ourselves and allowing others to do the same.  We don't need to 'win' over any point of views.

I think maybe Nixsee is saying that the kind of attitude of *shrug* "not my problem 'cause I'll be dead" is the very crux of the issue that has lead to people not giving a shit about their footprint on the planet.  
Things are going to get weird though, if through [life extension and age-reversal]( technology it turns out that actually, you might have an option to live forever...
If we suspend disbelief for a moment then and imagine we *are* going to become immortal (and explore space and inner-worlds and all kinds of cool stuff) you then must ask "would I be acting as selfishly as I am right now, knowing my actions may jeopardise those future possibilities?"  
If the answer is Yes, then one ought to "be the change" regardless of whether we do make those life extension things happen, since looking after yourself and the planet frees up more resources to be spent on making things like life extension truly feasible... and in the very 'worst' case scenario certainly ensures that it will definitely happen for the younger generations.
Not that I'm saying you aren't conscious of your footprint, just perhaps highlighting why it is people get irked when others say "Well I'm gonna' be dead in 20 years anyway so why should I care..."

At this point, they're no longer 'debates', it's a series of car crashes set to the Jerry Springer show.  
And yet science and progress marches on and gives not one hoot about this nonsense.  
My humble advice then: stop wasting time on 30 minute slices of ego driven entertainment, and spend that time learning about things you care about.
Then be confident enough in your knowledge to be able to think for yourself.

What happens to the 96% of all digital money inside computers (which will be close to 100% when physical cash is eventually phased out)?  
Of course, now there are [bitcoin satellites in space]( interestingly, bitcoin would probably fare better than the old systems that are reliant upon all kinds of overlapping tech infrastructure and data centres, whereas to get bitcoin back up and running all you'd need is a few nodes, a used satellite dish, and a mobile mesh network, I dare say it could even survive an internet failure with a few tweaks.
As I understand it, if a solar flare were headed to Earth we'd have around 2 weeks notice, which I reckon is probably all core would need to figure out an emergency sat-&gt;mesh contingency plan and, astonishingly, bitcoin may well experience zero downtime.  Would certainly be fun to see core do a dry run of all that on testnet after this fork is out the way and put that theory to the test!
There's no doubt a few other technicalities I'm missing, but as it stands I'd say bitcoin is much, much easier to reboot than the rest of the financial infrastructure.
Bear in mind, too, you can also transmit the bitcoin blockchain on short wave radio and via traditional cable TV broadcast.

Hmmm, I wonder.  Rather than dumping it, why don't we have core devs setup a multisig wallet to create a B2X 'pool' we all control through consensus?

Plenty of people care about this and are figuring out the solutions.  Google now all runs off green energy, so making it happen with bitcoin is going to be relatively simple once we get consensus on how to tackle it (either through code changes / hardware or a combination of the two).
There are lots of ideas, including Bram Cohen's Proof Of Space concept.  
See: 
As with the building of the internet, massive science projects like this take time, due to there being a plethora of opinions and ideas to take onboard.

Calling people stupid is not going to garner renewed support or forgiveness.
Openbazaar, like so many companies on that 'side' would have helped themselves and the community they claim to want to 'bring together' far more effectively, by accepting that the technology has already evolved beyond the assumptions their business models relied heavily upon (namely, bitcoin as a fast payment instrument vs. bitcoin as a secure settlement layer).  
Instead they chose hubris, and fighting the instincts of 1000's of computer scientists (including the original architects of all this many of whom were hardcore OB supporters).  It has taken years of research and discussions for those engineers to take in the information needed to decide on the best way forward.  It is perhaps no surprise they went with the option that will preserve robustness and security owhilst enabling *real* scale (in the order of billions) off-chain. 
It's a shame Brian and others didn't spend the time they wasted in 'twitter wars' getting excited by the new opportunities that Layer 2 solutions offer.  Hopefully they can get back to work and focus on the new horizon ahead.
I wish Brian and OB 2.0 the best of luck, but wonder if they blew their one shot at taking on Ebay (whose teams are surely amongst the 10,000 or so coders that have been working on Layer 2 the past few years).  After all, ebay and the huge userbases of the many other Web 2.0 incumbents stand to benefit massively from rolling out Layer 2 tech.

The dotcom rush and bust you are referring to (which is the best thing we have to compare this to) is actually the ICO and Altcoin market (the junk ones).  When that happens, all that money dangling there actually floods back into bitcoin.  Indeed, we see this happen with every single major new wave of adoption.  When Layer 2 tech further solidifies itself, we will see a bunch of that being pushed out into sidechain / drivechain projects and Lightning Network / Blockstack / Rootstock initiatives.
The Bitcoin settlement layer behind all that is just a technology - protocol level code.  The same as the internet.  For as long as that code keeps making progress and we keep delivering solutions that solve *real* world problems, there can be no bust.  
On a long enough timeline then, people will realise that [1 BTC has *always* been worth 1 BTC](  By which point people will be thinking in terms of Satoshis instead of the large bitcoin settlement trades that will be securing the underlying protocol and value exchange happening via the various sidechain initiatives.
I could be wrong of course, no-one can be certain which way all this will go because the technology is evolving so very quickly.

Yes seems a little far fetched to me too and none of this is in my field of expertise / interest.  Although I seem to remember Canada suffering massive power outs because of a small solar flare event in the early 00s.
As I understand it, we'd have about two weeks notice of an event of this kind, and I *think* provided the satellites were powered down before the flare hit, then brought back online, they'd survive.  
Certainly I'm guessing it would be a lot easier to build an EMP resistant satellite network than upgrading all the legacy power stations to cope with this. Heck, some Australian power stations can't even handle heavy lightning storms.

Time travellers are just people who think very deeply about the future, and pull that future forward to meet the present, thus shaping (and re-shaping) our collective future reality.  
We're all time travellers in that respect (ever thought very very deeply about all the possible ramifications of a life choice before deciding on the 'right' one? You exercised true free will and changed your future by traveling mentally into that future before deciding on the optimal path). 
It appears this is actually a kind of quantum superposition we put our brains in, similar to what plants do when they figure out the most optimal path for a photon to take during photosynthesis.
Banksy explains this in simpler terms "Your mind is working at its best when you're being paranoid.  You explore every avenue and possibility of your situation at high speed with total clarity."
Many people find they can reach this state through mindfulness and meditation.  In the end it all comes back to time (time to think slowly or quickly depending on environmental constraints and the task or 'choices' being considered).  
Finally, remember that the way we see time as being linear is entirely subjective; there is nothing in physics that tells us it has to be this way.

I don't 'shill', I drink nice cups of tea, contemplate the world and wonder why it is people get so worked up about things.


Statements like this (you don't know me, and so are not qualified to make such a comment) are borne of ignorant assumptions.  FYI, I've travelled to over 60 countries on this planet, living alongside locals of all social strata (from millionaires in places like the Hilton Hawaii, Indian street workers in Delhi, Greek protesters, British homeless people and ex Iraq War Vets and so on...) 
I've also stayed for months on end living alongside many muslim friends (from moderate to strict) all living in harmony alongside predominantly British, German and Spanish travellers.  Such is the wonder of travelling this world and ending up in strange youth hostels with nothing but a backpack and a laptop.


No there isn't.  Try living in London, Birmingham or Manchester in the UK and you will see a country where muslims live happily side by side British locals and consider themselves to be British.  Indeed, London has a Muslim mayor and some of Britain's finest comedians and social commentators are muslim.  Indian food is the nations favourite cuisine.  Prior to 9/11 most Brits didn't even think to ask what a Muslim/Sikh/Hindi was.  Their second favourite food is Chinese.  I dread to think what would happen to the nations health if either of those two wonderful contributions to British cuisine were to suddenly dry up.
And how do we define 'civilised society'?  One might ask why it is America still has the death penalty in many states when the rest of 'civilised' society abolished it decades ago.  One might also ask why Americans have more prisoners incarcerated per capita than so called 'uncivilised' regimes like China.  One might ask why more people die of depression and suicide than war and natural disasters combined... Why America throws away a third of its food and has the highest obesity rate on the planet when a third of the world lives close to starvation... One might ask why it is America has some of the worst child literacy rates of all 'civilised' nations.
One might ask why it is over 600,000 Americans go bankrupt because of their inability to pay medical bills when in places like Europe (and yes Islam too) that figure is ZERO.  
Seems like a good juncture to mention that [Islam invented the concept of the welfare state]( and as such do not have income tax or Usury.  Instead, everyone who can afford to is expected to donate 10% to causes they believe in.  
That sounds pretty 'civilised' to me.
Does all that mean America is a horrible, uncivilised cesspit of unfeeling, uncaring people?  No, my travels there tell me they are anything but.  I found most Americans to be kind, generous and warm hearted, just as most travellers find muslims (and people of all faiths) if they are prepared to go to new places and put preconceptions aside. 
But hey, [I'm not here to tell you what to think or feel](  It's for each of us to find our own truth in this life.  
I am glad you found bitcoin and salute you for spreading the word :)

Modern day muslims are no more responsible for the wars waged by their ancestors, than German citizens are for WWII or the English are for egregious acts committed in the name of Christianity and imperialism.  
You would all do well to *actually* go out of your comfort zone a little, travel and meet muslim people.  Indeed, there is nothing more beautiful than sitting on the hills of Sarajevo (a city ravaged by war only a few decades ago) to see the sunset, whilst listening to the Muslim call to prayer followed by Christian churchbells ringing in harmony.
99.9% of the people on this planet are good, honest, kind and generous when given the opportunity and right kind of nurture.  Those that aren't, fight each other for breadcrumbs tossed down from upon high by a tiny elite who have sold them into a lie in believing the world and its people are cruel and dangerous and, in doing so, created a false scarcity when in reality, there are enough resources on this planet to feed, clothe and provide a good way of life for *every single* inhabitant.
Anyone who has really travelled this beautiful planet of ours, will tell you the *real* world is far from cruel or dangerous once you are willing to let go of the lies people who deal in fear have told you.

It takes months and months of research and academic study to understand bitcoin.  Just as it took months of reading for people at CERN to understand Tim's idea of the world wide web and what it meant for the world.


I discovered and was reading about bitcoin in the first month of its release.  Been working on bitcoin projects and authoring whitepapers / software specifications - virtually full-time - for the last 5 years (I'm a programmer and systems analyst amongst other things).  I was also there at the beginning of the internet, telling people how things like email and mp3's were going to change the world ten years before they actually did whilst we had to endure nonsense from 'experts' like Paul Krugman and grit our teeth through the dotcom boomers who missed the point of why Tim gave the internet to the world patent free.
Those who truly understand bitcoin and where it is heading will be the first to tell you, they don't understand bitcoin or where it is headed.  
There are too many variables and way too many possible futures to say how this will all play out.  Only thing I know for sure, is that bitcoin *will* be as transformative as the internet itself irrespective of what Jamie or any old world paperbelt merchants have to say about it.  If you must listen to *any* 'experts' listen instead to people like Apple co-founder [Steve Wozniak]( or Facebook Executive [Chamath Palihapitiya](
Then perhaps delve into some videos by [Andreas Antonopoulos]( who is a wonderful independent voice in this space who truly understands the technology and the plethora of socio-economic problems Bitcoin was built to solve.

Sure... except there's nothing 'natural' about the way humans live; we are constantly reshaping our environments, cultures, diet, extending our toolsets, hacking our biology and evolving language, and the speed at which we can communicate and react to new information... and with all that the normative social influence is bombarded with new memes and ideas that challenge the status quo.
Money is just a technology - a human convention.  How we think about it and what we do with it, has changed in the past and it is changing again, far faster than anyone could have predicted as a result of the rapid increase in communication speeds the internet has afforded us.  Money is now essentially just digital information, as easy to transmit as an email.
There will come a time when a globally connected borderless internet citizenry will get to decide on macro and micro governance decisions through myriad liquid democracy style platforms powered by digitally 'networked states' and the combined 'wisdom of well informed crowds'.  We will see that these networked groups are far more able to serve the needs of the many than the well-meaning emperors with no clothes who currently represent us, whom are heavily reliant on medieval technology borne of a paperbelt era no longer fit-for-purpose.

Your argument makes no sense because none of the other nations in Europe have those problems I cited.  In fact those countries that embraced multi-culturalism and reduced the disparity of wealth fair far better, as [this groundbreaking 15 year study attests](  Further, America is a nation founded on immigrants (irish, greek, turkish, spanish) *built* America.  Your wonderful art and music is thanks to the mix of cultures.  Jazz, Rap, and Blues music are celebrated worldwide, and came originally from black slaves.


This is what emperors with no clothes want you to think, but it doesn't marry up with science which is why everyone from Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are insisting on the need for Universal Basic Income.  
Those emperors couldn't possibly tell you it was *their* greed and their addiction to war and oil and pushing consumerism and debt that is the real root of the problems America faces.  It's far easier to scapegoat other cultures and blame them for taking jobs when in truth, it is those immigrants willing to do the shitty jobs that keeps America ticking (when a million immigrants went on strike America ground to a halt).


America has its own identity, just as the UK does.  Mixing of culture, taking the best bits of each others knowledge, ideas, resources is what *grows* and *enhances* cultures and nations.  One only look to the "common wealth" and the increase in quality of life for everyone that occurred as a result of the sharing of those ideas and resources.
 


Again, it's scapegoating, blaming others for your own problems.  You have a founding document that can never change, no matter how much society has outgrown it.  You have kids killing other kids in high school massacres, and live under a cloud of fear whilst those in 'charge' tell you it's someone elses fault whilst you all fight against one another for the breadcrumbs they toss down.


I can point to many muslim countries (such as Bosnia, India, Bali) where white westerners of all faiths live happily alongside locals.  Instead of pointing fingers at Saudi Arabia, again, perhaps look at why it is your leaders are only too happy to make arms deals and buy oil from them?




We tend to look back at the past through rose tinted goggles.  America's always had problems.  The Great Depression wasn't that long ago.  After that was prohibition.  Today, you now live in more abundant luxury than kings and queens did a 100 years ago.  There is less global war, less absolute poverty than at any time in history.  You are more likely to die falling out of bed in a morning or be struck by lightning than to be involved in a terrorist attack. 
America is *still* a great nation.  But it is not - and never has been - the greatest nation on Earth, since there can be no such thing.  Any American cosmonaut who has experienced the 'astronaut overview effect' will tell you the same thing.  With it, comes the realisation that we truly are just one planet, trying to figure out if we're alone in the universe.
America is going through tough times but the rest of the world is with her.  Not with your emperors and elites but the ordinary American people.  Let us hope that bitcoin and other technologies like it will help you all find the light and regain your individual dignity and with it, renewed confidence in each other.


British people don't argue about Islam, they still have an identity and they get along just fine with the various cultures that live there in the big old melting pot that gave birth to the industrial revolution thanks, in large part, to the trade routes opened up by embracing other cultures and seeing the world for what it is "one planet" one "common" wealth to be shared by all.  
We can fight change or we can choose to stop fighting over breadcrumbs and see the invisible prison walls of our own making and the truth - that we live in a world of abundance.  And realise that world is full of beautiful people and beautiful places and that we are who we are only as a result of a random cosmic dicethrow.  
All you have to do is step outside the box, smile a bit more and just enjoy the simple pleasure of being alive.
And how lucky you are to be around at a time when bitcoin was invented.  For me, I am as giddy at all this as I was when I first turned on the internet all those years ago and began communicating with people all over the planet through BBS boards.

FAQ: 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:13:59
I think crowd-driven voluntary taxation and liquid democracy governance systems based on around 10% of earnings being cycled into micro and macro programmes that individuals get to preside over (so they can actually decide what, how and with whom their energy is spent on) is the best way of applying all this technology.  Everything then gets delegated to the 'wisdom of well informed crowds' and all the wastage in the current system is eradicated by virtue of that glass governance showing transparent payments in and out of everything from public transport and hospital care to locally driven crowd-funding initiatives.
UK Government calls this kind of thing 'Glass Governance' and see how decentralising decision making in this way is a good thing (after all it's why we invented councils and other local governance bodies in the paperbelt world).  What we're describing here is just the logical digital extension of all that running over bitcoin serving as the backbone public ledger.  
Bribery, administration mistakes, and all the wasted energy through miscommunication and inefficient budgeting is removed from the system meaning things like public healthcare and transport can embrace true innovation bringing us toward a system that runs off both Universal Basic Income and the aforementioned Voluntary Taxation subsidies.  Eventually with automation, the 9-5 culture that dictated everybody needed to 'earn' a living becomes a thing of the past and we move toward a world of abundance where economies are able to truly economise.
It will likely require some kind of Jubilee and the forgiving of widespread debt but [this has happened many times in the past](  Indeed, bitcoin's deflationary nature means, ostensibly, that process has already begun.
All of that will need people to start taking individual responsibility for their own wealth, their own lives and to become more active citizens in their local communities, but I think many will relish the challenge, especially the younger generations who will intuitively understand these new platforms being built.

r/bitcoin is the original sub, r/btc was created by those vested in businesses in this space wanting the underlying core technology to scale faster (due to their business models requiring that the protocol enable cheap, fast, payments for things like coffee purchases).  
The scientists behind bitcoin (and r/bitcoin) disagreed with that approach, and believe bitcoin's security and decentralisation come before the needs of business.  In addition, they see secondary scaling solutions (sidechains / drivechains / lightning network) as the only true way of *actually* scaling to billions of transactions (which cannot be done with main bitcoin protocol scaling).  
Think of it like twitter limiting tweets to keep everything lightweight and readable, but enabling you to link to external sites like blogger.com within those tweets for more verbose texts.
This careful, cautious approach that at all times requires consensus, can oftentimes seem infuriating to the fast-paced business world and eventually Roger and others forked bitcoin to create a competing implementation called Bitcoin Cash.
It's a shame it went that way, because all the arguments, twitter spats and wasted energy meant that practical scaling solutions were held back some two years, due to a divide in a community that had hitherto all been on the same page.
I'm sure we'll all hug it out again once the Layer 2/3 solutions go online in the next 6-18 months.  In the meantime, Bitcoin continues to operate as an incredible store of value and we're only just beginning to see the many amazing things that are being built with all this.  We can be incredibly proud of how far we've come, but really this is only the beginning of the story.  In internet terms, we've just figured out how to do email... Layer 2/3 heralds the invention of the web browser ;)
In the meantime, if you want to use bitcoin to make cheap, fast payments here in the West, there are plenty of options now (such as Bitcoin Debit cards) that elegantly solve the issue.
There's a great explainer below from Chamath Palihapitiya on why Bitcoin is so important as a store of value, and why we need patience for it to eventually become a payment instrument.

It's not bitcoin to me, or you, or the myriad other people that were here at the very beginning.  But if it's Bitcoin to someone else then we don't have the right to tell them they are wrong.  We are not rulers of the 'one true coin'.  That is a hubristic stance for people like Craig Wright to take. 
Understanding that we don't have a right to say what bitcoin should be is key to understanding why bitcoin as we believe it to be, will succeed.
A tricky thing to get your head around, kinda' like the double slit experiment.  But if you can, you will find much inner peace and the realisation that nothing can go 'wrong'.

Sure it can (and *is* being).  There are the KYC on/off ramp requirements and the fact the bitcoin public ledger is pseudonymous, meaning every transaction can be seen publicly (which makes things simple for blockchain analysis and the tracing of monetary flow; something that is nigh on impossible with bank note security numbers, especially given so many are in the shadow economy and being counterfeited.  
Expect a future where good people, companies, governments and agencies are only too happy to have their transaction flows audited (because they have nothing to worry about) and where shady outfits partaking in stuff like blood diamond trading, illegal land mine purchases etc. would immediately get flagged.  Currently those things are easily passed through the banking / hidden shell company offshore infrastructure.

Any party that seeks to take control, will quickly find another party is able to deploy countermeasures.  This is the essence of decentralisation.
In the case of mining centralisation, a relatively trivial PoW code change would see any attacking party find their mining equipment bricked overnight.  
e.g. 
Of course, I highly doubt such a countermeasure would need to be deployed, but honest actors in the ecosystem can be comforted in knowing there are backup plans for backup plans.

Off the top of my head:
1. Machine-payable-web allowing payments to happen without middlemen gateways.
2. Micropayments powering everything from Youtube and Reddit upvotes to *real* quality journalism being rewarded by the crowd as opposed to ad-powered media conglomerates.  
3. Ad-Free internet via [Brave browser]( style technology that allows users to spread payments across their favourite websites on a Pay What You Can Afford basis.
4. Ad-hoc LETS style economies enabling 4 billion citizens on the planet currently cut off from the global market, to bootstrap entire maker economies with nothing but a $20 used satellite and mobile mesh network via something like the [Blockstream Satellite]( (they won't even need the internet).
5. UBI schemes and welfare state overhaul that allows us to tackle things like homelessness by providing clients with special alt-currencies running over the atomic swap network that can only be spent on things like food, accommodation and drug dependency rehab etc.  Also extends to ordinary citizens who might want to curtail their spend on gambling and other addictions.
6. Glass governance that allows the public ledger to be audited by ordinary citizens, who will see a transparent flow of money between government and local council accounts.  Potentially leading to voluntary taxation and a much more efficient revenue distribution service that gives citizens full control over where their money is spent.
7. Land registry, title deeds, asset locking on an immutable ledger that is not subject to ever being corrupted.
8. Decentralised encrypted layers of personal data via Blockstack that means never again can things like the Equifax breach happen (since you do not ever have to trust a 3rd party or broken I.T. infrastructure with your private data).
9. Impossible to counterfeit (but cryptographically secure) passport, visa, identity issuance that can update in realtime.
10. IoT devices and Distributed Autonomous Organisations.
11. Liquid democracy voting and crowdfunding platforms that enable citizens to congregate online and take a more active role in governance of their cities and neighbourhoods. 
Much of that will come with Layer 2 technology (Sidechains, Drivechains, Rootstock, Lightning Network, Blockstack, MAST).  All of it will require a secure blockchain that we can be sure is run on protocol level (meaning bulletproof) code.  
That blockchain is Bitcoin.

Let us remember the reason we have warehouses full of rotting rice and essential medical supplies stuck in third world countries where people are in dire need of those things is because people speculated on futures.  No matter how fancy the nomenclature, it's just more zero-sum gambling and it does nothing to help solve the [many challenges]( facing our species or improve the lives of the downtrodden.  
You will find most of the technologists who got into bitcoin - the idea (back when Wall Street were laughing at us all) will raise one eyebrow at this news and remind Wall Street that bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme - it's a save the world scheme.
Speculators and investors who truly care about the future of this planet, would all be better off just buying a handful of bitcoins each, and leaving the techies to it and/or helping them rebuild things anew instead of repeating the mistakes that required bitcoin be invented in the first place.  
That help could be as simple as buying some bitcoins and taking a years sabbatical away from the [invisible prison walls]( surrounding those gambling terminals, and travelling the world.  
Perhaps then they may realise that bitcoin, like life, [need not be a race](
Of course, either way, bitcoin will be just fine.
In the meantime, good luck on your journey, and thanks for your support.  Hodl in there :)

It really depends how you structure it.  The internet allows us to build things in a way where consensus of the many requires no hierarchies.  Crowdfunding, Github repositories are all examples of where people like yourself can exercise an equal share of voice if your ideas have merit.
Corporations, like money, are just social institutions.  The way they are governed have changed in the past because of new technology and they are now changing again.
Of course all of that requires stepping out of the inter-subjective reality we exist in today and thinking long and hard about the new world all this leads to.
You, like myself, have no real say in how any of that unfolds, we can only strive to expand our sphere of influence so that we may play a small, positive role in helping to shape that future.

So is bitcoin in terms of the ecosystem participants being able to influence and guide the development roadmap.  BIP's (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) are submitted and peer-reviewed, discussed at length via IRC / Github / Slack / LinuxFoundation mailing lists.  If they reach consensus the change happens (Segwit is one such advance).
A proof of work mining algorithm change would go through that route.
Then we have the outside hardware and consumer divisions building things like lightbulbs that can mine bitcoin, heaters that can mine, and perhaps one day everything from your toaster, laptop and fridge will.  Remember, there was once a time without ASIC miners or hardware wallets or exchanges.  All the infrastructure you see today has changed and will change again just as rapidly to meet the growing needs of users.
There's also power companies that are looking to mine.  Russia are looking to online an entire town and vent the excess heat produced to keep the village heated, for example.
And things get really interesting when a hydro/solar plant that is mining with excess energy produced and consumers can pay (and receive dividends) directly in bitcoin.  Some of these are already being built in Scandinavia IIRC.
There's a Japanese energy company recently announced flat-rate billing for anyone that wants to mine.  And there will no doubt be even more exciting things in the pipeline that no-one has even thought of yet. 


Think of it like this: closed systems are at the mercy of gatekeepers having guessed at the solution whereas more open systems allow the ecosystem to find the optimal solution.  It's the underlying principle of open source development (linux, bitcoin, android).
It's the reason the International Space Station runs the open system of Linux for mission critical infrastructure.

4G and electricity stored in a *battery*.  Which is why you can browse Reddit and send a bitcoin payment from the beach ;)
Personally, I carry a power bank around with me so my smartphone has 5x the usual battery life when I'm traveling.  
Shops that suffer regular power outages (in places like India and even Australia) usually have backup UPS batteries kicking in when the grid goes down.  But as a one off, smartphones and bitcoin pose an elegant solution.  
This gets more exciting when we consider the possibilities of, say, a Kenyan village in the middle of nowhere running off one solar panel, a satellite uplink and ad-hoc mobile mesh networks.  
A standard leisure battery (used in caravans) trickle charging from a very basic solar panel would probably satisfy all the charging / power needs for a basic array of mobiles and a few raspberry pi's, enabling the village to plug into the global economy without any major infrastructure requirements.  
Imagine then trading directly with a Kenyan wedding dress maker or coffee bean farmer without any intermediaries in the chain via crowd funding platforms with standard trust and escrow models baked in.  
This has huge ramifications for getting aid directly to the people that need it, and allows us to also fund all kinds of maker economies from a distance which ultimately leads to a huge reduction in poverty and the kind of forced economic migration that has lead to so many western cities struggling to cope with the upheaval we've seen as a result of this.

No problem!


Scaling is what we need to do for the network to be able to effectively deal with say, billions of transactions, and then trillions (as opposed to the very small number possible on the main base layer protocol).
For that, [Lightning Network]( and Sidechains / Drivechains are being developed that will allow for billions of transactions to happen through payment hubs, with bitcoin being used to settle them.  
The advantage there is that we can do many, many tiny micro-payments at essentially zero (or close to zero) cost.  They are then batched up and settled on the bitcoin protocol when the payment channel is closed.  
We're just seeing the first working alphas coming out now.
See: Zap ( for a glimpse of what that will look like.

I haven't looked at his resume but I'm pretty certain Jamie has zero Computer Science credentials.  His opinion on the longterm fundamentals of a science and technology that, for the first time in human history, managed to solve the 'double spend-problem' is about as authoritative as Paul Krugman's was when asked about the internet in the early days to which he remarked quite self-assuredly "the internet will have no more effect on global business than the fax machine."
Krugman also said there would be no housing bubble in America which just goes to show how much these 'experts' know about 'all things financial'.  Bill Gates (one of Buffet's best buds) said Google would 'last no more than a year'.

The UN / an NGO sets up an outpost in some remote region with nothing but a satellite receiver, some cheap mobile phones, and raspberry Pi's all running off Solar... 
An ad-hoc economy is bootstrapped via mobile mesh-nets, powered by a worldwide, transparent fund tied to the NGO's main bitcoin wallet.  A local currency is issued on a LETS style basis backed up by the bitcoin reserve wallet being monitored via satellite (think how MPESA mobile phone credits took off as a currency).  Rootstock and Blockstack solutions are bolted onto the currency unit via a tailor made sidechain allowing for things like identity services, with baked in web of trust style networks blooming out as a result.  
Atomic swaps mean the local currency can work anywhere bitcoin is accepted outside of the remote area, meaning supply runs to cities etc. can happen with ease and there will be a visible trace on where all the NGO / UN money has been spent without any intermediary 'leakage'.  In addition, SMS (like MPESA) could be used to move the currency around without internets using established mobile networks and cheap 1st gen cell phones that are already in widespread use.  Eventually, tailor made hardware wallets would become commonplace, all operating over mesh net infrastructure. 
Eventually, locals themselves would take charge of the system and hook into worldwide crowdfund platforms that allow for direct ebay / kickstarter style exchange with suppliers, customers and backers.  
We saw how meshnets like this took off in the 'Umbrella Revolution' in Hong Kong, when 3G coverage was cut.  It only required one mobile phone with access to the internet to power the entire crowd via the mesh.  Similarly, in Egypt when Mubarak cut off the internet, it required just a few 56k modems plugged into telephone networks to get information out to the West via twitter etc.
The NGO then moves onto the next destination to repeat.
Indeed, the UN's World Food Programme are currently trailing these kinds of systems with Bitcoin and Ethereum as we speak.  IIRC the pilot is expected to be expanded to some 5,000 merchants by Q1 2018.  The system is also built in a completely decentralised fashion in order that it may survive even the collapse of the UN itself.
And that's everything that's possible TODAY...  When the satellites are 2-way, much of the above can be streamlined even further.  
As for how it helps with the West: take, for example, the [X.82 class Solar Flare]( which we puny Earthlings recently dodged. Such an event could knock out all the planets power grids which would bring down every single electronic payment system we currently rely on wreaking a fair bit of havoc in the Western world.
Bitcoin users, however, (assuming the satellites remain functioning) would be largely unaffected by such an event.  Indeed, they could even manage to send the blockchain out via shortwave radio if necessary, and there is also a cable TV station in Scandinavia that's been broadcasting the bitcoin blockchain for quite some time IIRC.

It's good and well-intentioned advice.  Although bitcoin has matured a lot in recent years and is no longer subject to the tiny FUD shocks that were behind stuff like the Mt. Gox crash you are referring to.
We're also seeing a much wider group of adopters now with more diverse demographics and them getting backed up by institutional investors that are adding a further safety net.  
But yes, ideally rather than seeing it as a get rich quick scheme people will start thinking about how they can earn bitcoins.  There are plenty of opportunities to get involved in the space for people of all skillsets.  
Finally, I'd also say that for every crazy person taking out gargantuan loans there are a 100 more that have been dollar cost averaging and, for the first time in their lives, have actually found a way to save money.

So you're saying it would be simpler to rebuild the entire planetary power grid that relies on all kinds of different competing interests, ageing infrastructure and myriad different technologies from solar, hydro, wind to nuclear and coal... On two weeks notice... Than to secure 4 satellites in space...  You'd think if it was that easy, we'd convert it all to green energy tomorrow.
As for turning those satellites on and off again, would be a case of having a failsafe switch on a mechanical timer (think how those old clockwork timer plugs work to turn your lights on when you're away on vacation).  I'm quite positive NASA have had to install such systems to get probes through hostile atmospheres that would fry all the sensitive electronics onboard.  That's why, after a successful landing, there's always that scarily long window of radio silence where everyone waits on tenterhooks for all the electronics to boot back up and send out an 'A OK' signal.

There are plenty of companies, groups, organisations, NGO's, governmental structures that operate via consensus without formal hierarchies.  There are also formal corporate structures such as workers Co-Operatives that enshrine concepts of consensus when making decisions.
Anonymous, the Occupy Movement, Open Source initiatives like Bitcoin are examples of how groups of people can come together behind a common purpose without the need for any kind of formal 'leaders'.
Occupy (which was the biggest global protest movement in human history) operated via consensus at formal General Assemblies and a number of working groups, which mimics the way parts of the W3C foundation is run and managed when deciding protocol upgrades to the architecture and platforms that shape the internet.  Occupy were keen to label themselves as a 'leaderless' organisation although I prefer the term 'leader*full*' movement.  We of course observe the same thing on Github with countless open source projects that have no hierarchy.  There are myriad lithe internet startup teams that operate their companies in this manner too.
It is folly to believe the world stands still, and the status quo we are used to will remain forever.  One only needs to look back at all the technological advances in the last 10 years to observe that truism.  Heck, Youtube and the first smartphone only appeared a decade ago.  With each new generation comes new ideas and new ways of doing things that sees us rebuilding and refining the work of those [giants]( that came before us whose shoulders we now stand on.  This is the very essence of human progress.
But I'm not here to convince you.  It's up for you to make up your own mind.

As for why core didn't attend:
Ever thought people couldn't make it, couldn't afford the flight or have enough time to go through the onerous process of applying for a U.S. visa?  Or perhaps they were busy doing other things (like MiT exams and attending bitcoin lectures for example?) or ya know, actually *working on the core code* to enhance the network.  
Maybe some people didn't even speak English and would not have been able to make sense of the meeting or feel qualified to sign without seeing a google translation.  Maybe some people were shy and nervous.  Maybe some people were *too young* to travel and give their opinion, much like a young Aaron Swartz in the early days when he was helping contribute to internet advancement through IRC but felt too young to meet IRL.
Or maybe they felt uneasy making decisions on behalf of the entire network and its users at such a meeting?  Maybe some prefer not to go out in public and stand on a podium, because they cherish their private life and don't want to drag friends and family into this (like *real* Satoshi for instance)?  
And maybe they felt they had no right to make such a decision unless all the words were on public record.  
 
Maybe instead, they prefer to use electronic communication because it gives people time to reflect at their own pace and think deeply about issues whilst taking on a plethora of opinions (from people over multiple timezones, locales and with different circumstances/demographics/routines).  And maybe they prefer that environment because it lessens the chance of big personalities strong arming the quieter, more thoughtful types?
Or maybe they felt everything had already been said through the numerous online (and fully public and accountable) IRC logs, BIPs and Mailing list discussions?

If a company wants to try do that they would of course be free to give it a go.  Indeed, there are some white only golf clubs and plenty of men only members clubs that exclude women in existence still.
Of course, for the vast majority of humanity who view such establishments as belonging to the medieval world, it's likely you would have much mileage if you tried to run a startup on such outdated moral values... especially one focused on a technology that is enabling a world of trade without borders or prejudice.
That does not mean companies in this space have to give blanket access to people and organisations they feel aren't a good fit for the ethos of their company.  
In a similar vein, you can opt out of using companies you feel don't ascribe to the same set of moral values you hold dear, by voting with your pocket book and choosing not to fund them.

Computer scientists are a weird bunch.   The same talent required to analyse, design and architect complex computing systems can be applied to solve problems in almost any other system, such as law, society, economics... *without* requiring formal training in those areas. 
Indeed, it is the job of a systems analyst to go into an industry, analyse those old paper based analogue workflows and figure out how to better streamline them through the deployment of far more efficient digital solutions.  
Analysing these problems from a completely new angle is what then gives rise to radical new solutions that narrow specialists in a given field would never have thought of since they aren't able to think outside the existing system constrained by those analogue toolsets.  
This often leads to new, far more efficient methods being developed by those systems analysts that obsoletes the old ways of thinking about a problem / solution.
One example would be the ex Microsoft engineer that had spent 20 years working on email spam who then went on to work in medicine, only to make a huge breakthrough in HIV immunisation by applying the same techniques he developed for email spam detection to find and block changes in HIV cell mutation.  This is not something a classically trained biologist could have come up with.
A computer scientist like Andreas is therefore more than capable of gaining a solid understanding of economics (and almost any other system) without formal training, but an economist cannot understand the art of computer science without first going back to school and learning the discipline (which can be done of course).

Sure, double spend, or [Byzantine Generals Problem]( is the reason we have always needed a 'trusted' third party during value exchange since it was thought it could never be solved.  It's why we invented Tally Sticks and then Double Entry accounting...
Then came along computers and for awhile we used them to basically mirror those old accounting practices via spreadsheets and so forth.  Yet, for over two decades computer nerds were trying to fix that double spend problem with cryptography.  
It was still thought to be impossible until a 2008 [whitepaper]( by Satoshi Nakamaoto finally fixed it; drawing on what scientists call Proof of Work (derived from HashCash by Adam Back (see [Blockstream](
This quickly attracted the attention of Mike Hearn (a chief security engineer at Google at the time), who put together an email group of some 400 Googlers and reported back to them and Sergey Brin whilst working in his Google 20% time on the project.
There was a sort of collective nerdgasm in the years that followed as many computer scientists and engineers who had been fixated on how we fix all the problems that lead to the 2008 crash realised Bitcoin was the solution.
Mike eventually went full time on Bitcoin working alongside the incredible [Hal Finney]( and Satoshi, before leaving some years later to consult with banks on blockchain technologies via a group called R3.
Bitcoin quickly grew to become the biggest distributed computing network on the planet.
It's been a chaotic ride, as it has been necessary for Bitcoin to evolve organically without any group able to take control (so we could avoid the kinds of power structures using bitcoin as a system of control like they did in the old world of money).  
This means the ecosystem has to find the optimal solutions since there are no gatekeepers or hierarchies that can make decisions without the consensus of the entire group (and groups of users).
On the development side, bitcoin has around 200+ of the smartest computer scientists and engineers on the globe (from Stamford and MiT to as far as UCL) actively peer-reviewing and doing due diligence on every single line of code and proposal.  Nothing changes without that consensus.  
Even if the code does change, ordinary people have to agree to run the software.  
This has meant upgrading the system has been a purposefully slow and labour intensive process; everything happens completely transparently via IRC / Slack / Mailing Lists and the Github repository, so for people used to working in corporate environments with classically defined hierarchies, this approach can seem a little alien.
However, it's a necessity because, as you rightly point out the technology has the potential to *change* everything.  
With that comes great responsibility, hence those 200+ computer scientists and engineers are constantly peer-reviewing each other and writing essays on a delay basis discussing the tiniest of details.
Remember there was a time people had the same reservations about the internet.  Luckily for us, the very same people that built the internet have our backs in all this, and the younger generation of coders who are working in tandem with them, who are just, quite frankly, amazing.   
As for the speculation and people getting caught up in the price.  That's to be expected, but most of us who have been here for many, many years are not here for the 'money' and not a single person is paid for contributing the code repository...  
Bitcoin is not a company.  It is a protocol.  In computer science terms, when we refer to something as being a protocol (like the internet protocol) we mean it is bulletproof code.  
Bitcoin is not, however, a get rich quick scheme, it is a fix the world scheme.
I would encourage you to look through Jameson Lopp's Bitcoin Resources ( for a great collection of links, ideas, history and research.
Thanks :)

Blockchain is nothing but a fancy database which has been turned into a buzzword and, sadly, there is much confusion out there as a result.  Blockchain is just *one* ingredient in a whole soup of technological breakthroughs (such as Proof of Work) underpinning bitcoin.  
The internet is not akin to a database, but databases sure were useful powering part of the backend of html websites.
BCH and alts are competing protocols challenging the layer 2 scaling vision; IBM and Microsoft also had competing protocols to the internet (they were, arguably, better by design but far more centralised).  Had they prevailed, one of their versions of TCP/IP would have been the backbone of what the world called the internet.
The key thing to grasp here is that, like the internet, people are free to do whatever they wish with the word bitcoin and there is no underlying corporate structure or brand protecting its use or technological evolution.  Which means that, yes, BCH and others can attempt to challenge the bitcoin core roadmap and their mission of becoming 'the internet of money' just as IBM and Microsoft were free to challenge the engineers behind the internet as TCP/IP in their mission to become the world's information superhighway.
I'm sure that ruffled some feathers in the camp that started that entire internet thing (and had already done the hard work of getting the invention out into the world) but when you gift an idea to the world for free and without a patent, these are the risks you have to take.  The upside is, there is no central entity to go after if the disruption of your innovations threaten incumbents (as the internet did of course).

The dotcom rush happened between 1990-2000.  It took **6 years** for Microsoft to release a native TCP/IP stack.
Specifically: *Windows 95 service release 1 and later (February 1996), or the first release with the Plus! pack, installed a TCP/IP stack and dialler as standard. The TCP/IP stack shipped with the first release of Windows 95, but wasn't installed by default. Windows NT 3.5 also included Winsock*

All this talk of governments doing this and that.  At what point did we forget most governments are composed of elected representatives put there to carry out the will of the people?
There is no reason that body of representatives should be opposed to radical new technologies like the internet and bitcoin.
If they *are* defacto opposed to new ideas capable of fixing the entropy, you need to question whether they understand the job of government and their role in it.  And if you feel that they don't, use your voice or... choose to exit.
Of course, since the beginning of all this, most governments working in the light have been very open to bitcoin.
Which is why, after 9 years, the future of Bitcoin  is looking brighter than ever.

Can you explain then why it is America has more prisoners per capita than China and other Communist countries so often villified by Americans?
Why does America have school shootings, the highest rates of depression and suicide?
Why is the death penalty still tolerated when nearly every other country in the West long ago outlawed it?
Why haven't they managed yet to decouple national healthcare services and the welfare state (ideas invented by Islam btw) from profit incentive, like so many other countries (from West to East) have?  
To be frank, I think people living in glass houses ought think twice before throwing stones and take care of tending the problems in their own back yards, before having the audacity to tell people what is wrong in the yards of those they have never visited, or actually seen first hand.
Similarly, when people say to me "Americans are all ignorant fools" I'll reply with "Have you ever been to America, met Americans?  They're some of the kindest people I've enountered."
It is not for us to impose our values or ways of life on other people or other cultures (especially those we don't understand), any more than it is my right... as a Brit, to come into America, take away your 10 gallon bottles of coke, and force you all to start drinking tea whilst insisting on better queuing etiquette.  Even if we do know that less coke and more tea will keep you all a lot calmer, and that orderly queuing is a much more efficient and fairer way of doing things :p
There is no perfect system of governance or political ideology, any more than there is a perfect system of religious values.
Can we help one another figure it all out?  Sure, but that requires dialogue, compassion, kindness and empathy and trusting those that know their cultures the best to figure things out for themselves.
The dialogue bit requires actually going to these places instead of believing things we are spoonfed by those who want us all to fight over breadcrumbs tossed down from upon high.
This is all just as applicable to those in 'power' who are spoonfeeding the masses bitcoin and 'blockchain' FUD whilst trying to impose their values on the culture we bitcoiners have curated over the last decade.

Argument  Steve Wozniak, Paul Graham, Jack Dorsey and practically everyone else who built the internet disagree with you.
"If you own 0.28btc you are in the next 1%" — Former Google Exec (although I hope there will never be a need for a 1% in this more equitable future we're headed towards).
Worth pointing out that [Bezos says Amazon is likely to fail and go bankrupt in the next 30 years](  He, like Wozniak and everyone else are good at analysing long term trends.  Don't get stuck in the status quo.  Standard Oil and Railroad giants are no longer the biggest companies in the world.
Although, that said, none of us can see into the future so if what you predict did happen then c'est la vie, bitcoiners would be the first to adapt.  Personally I feel it's highly unlikely since bitcoin's greatest properties are the same which gave TCP/IP the edge over competing corporate internet protocols from IBM and Microsoft at the time (i.e. TCP/IP was open, borderless, decentralised and censorship resistant.  This is what captured the imagination of the most diverse groups of engineers and users and thus gave it the network effect.  I could be wrong though, we'll all just have to wait and see what technology users and engineers most fall in love with.
Argument   Funnily enough, a friend's power went down in his shop when his fusebox blew out last year.  The only thing he could accept was cash and bitcoin (since it was trivial to keep a smartphone charged with a portable power pack).  Governments are most certainly phasing out cash (which is the worst form of money in terms of laundering and fraud) so that's a reality we're just gonna' have to come to terms with.
As we wean ourselves off fossil fuels and it becomes cheaper and easier to install solar power in our homes (as we must if we are to save the planet) then most of those issues are alleviated.  Again, this is about asking ourselves what world we will be living in 10-20 years, not the one that we straddle right now.


Yeah and you still sign for things with your bank cards instead of chip and pin, mostly because of the risk of being held up at gunpoint and forced to hand over your pin.  Meanwhile the entire continent of Europe switched to chip and pin nearly a decade ago and contactless is now ubiquitous.  Most of us don't even bother signing the back of our bank cards.


We're back to [diffusion of innovations]( again.  Old people are the *Laggards* (last 16%).  They end up joining because of the perks.  
It's pretty ordinary now to see old folk skyping on a tablet in airports and the like because of the benefits that come with being able to stay in touch with loved ones via video chat etc.  Also it's becoming increasingly difficult for old folk to 'upgrade' their phones to non smartphone tech when their contract is due for renewal so, at least here in the UK, most of the phone sales shops are offering free teaching, guidance and ongoing support to those unfamiliar with the technology. Google voice / siri are set to make things even easier for them and they'll wonder how they ever managed sending texts via their clunky old Nokia and its terrible UI (and yet old skool unintuitive SMS messaging was a new skill they all managed to learn a decade ago).  They also fall in love with having a camera in their pocket at all times, and the old are now the fastest growing demographic on facebook.
Older generations have also started to get used to swiping and gestures through using them in banks and on planes etc.  Just as they had to get used to moving from typewriters to wordprocessors and learn the peculiarities of how a mouse and GUI functioned.  I still remember a student in my business class decades ago wondering what this weird 'mouse' thing was and waving it around in the air expecting the mouse 'pointer' to start moving.
This is all part of getting those older generations still running governments and councils up to speed with the digital hyperconnected reality we now live in.  And that's gonna' be crucial since cyberspace is now inseparable from meatspace.  The old giving way to (and merging with) the young and their boundless energy devoid of cynicism is just part of the natural order of things.

There's no 'us' vs. 'them'.  As such 'we' haven't 'lost', since there can be no 'winning' or 'losing' when everyone is on the same 'side'.  The road to true unity is paved with minor concessions from all 'sides'.  
If you're not happy with how things are then it's within your power to go out there, to help educate and inform and tell your parents what you think they're doing wrong.  Real change can only happen though understanding, which has to come through dialogue and hard work.  For every Ed Snowden out there in the public eye, the are a 1000 others like him doing things quietly in order to keep the peace, as humanity collectively figures out how to rebuild things.
The discussion here is not whether individuals should have privacy (that's a given), but whether that should happen on the base layer or through sidechain initiatives and layer 2/3 tech like blockstack, leaving the base protocol operating as a pseudonymous settlement layer which we might insist charities, institutions, corporate supply chains and government departments use to expose everything going on to the crowd.  
Once we install full transparency of where public funds are being used, the temptation for the organised criminal class in powerful organisations to cheat is removed, just as the temptation for common criminals (and those in authority) to steal and commit violent crime is removed when data protection laws move inline with mass surveillance, and the ordinary citizenry are armed with a video camera in their pocket (mass sousveillance).  Hence places like the UK now have less violent crime than at any point in history and less levels of police corruption.
We'll see the same happen when governments, councils and powerful corporations open up their books to the crowd.
It is my view that were we to allow anonymity on the base layer, then the same unscrupulous corporations of the 'greed is good' ethic would exploit bitcoin in the same way politics and financial legal frameworks have been exploited and we'd be back to square one, but with bigger, faster, stronger levels of exploitation.
I may be wrong in all this, and I'm confident that those thinking very deeply about these issues at the technical level are likely already ahead of the curve.  
That's the beauty of all this; conversations like the one we're having are all part of the process of influence that will ultimately lead to the ecosystem figuring things out.

Sure yeah, and alcohol use is banned in some countries (was even banned in America in the 1920's).  In other countries we ban eating dogs and cats, smoking pot, whereas places in Asia it's fine to do both at the same time!  Eating horses in the UK will see you go to jail, but perfectly fine in France.  
There are different ages of consent everywhere on the globe.  Some Asian countries have little to no copyright laws, but in Sweden, you will go to jail for building something like the Pirate Bay if you piss off the wrong people.
So how can any of it make sense if you see yourself as an Earthling and the entire world as one?  At the end of the day, we just have to respect different cultures and the rules those cultures have agreed upon, just as we do when we visit a subreddit.  
The internet has made physical borders irrelevant to younger generations that have been travelling the world and realising the entire place (and most people) are absolutely lovely when you get rid of the labels and tags. 
Changing rules takes time, and people need to want to change them enough to make it happen.  In the meantime, there will continue to be a lot of really stupid stuff said and done by 'leaders' enforcing those rules... in every single country on the planet.

There's a big difference between criminals and those who believe they must break corrupt laws in order to pull humanity forward.  Were it not for people prepared to do just that we'd have no civil rights, women's rights, net neutrality (cough) and no constitution (which was founded on an act of treason).  Laws change; society evolves (as we are witnessing with gay marriage and cannabis legalisation sweeping across the globe, something unthinkable just a handful of years ago).
As for the weirdos comment. Well... those of us who originally got into computers (and then the internet) were once branded freaks and weirdos before things like video games became mainstream.
As Alan Moore points out "all *cult*ure derives from *cult*."
Nowadays, mainstream high street shops sell "Geek" t-shirts; a term that was once derogatory... It seems intelligence is something people nowadays aspire to and celebrate.  Which can only be a good thing if we are seeking to free humanity, since a prerequisite of that will mean getting everyone up to the same level of education.

Decentralised collaboration is about 'co-opetition' in the p2p ideaspace; where idea and development happens out in the open via IRC, Reddit, Linux Foundation mailing lists, Github and Bitcoin Improvement Proposals and Peer review. 
It's how the internet was bootstrapped by a small coterie of nerds dispersed across the globe after all.  
What we're trying to avoid here is the tragedy of the commons.
The future is a 'battleground' of IDEAS **not** IDEALOGIES.
No outdated ideologies (and the some of the toxic, tribalistic ideas borne of 'ists' and 'isms' they give oxygen to) created before the idea of the internet had even been conceived by humanity, are needed – either in cyberspace *or* meatspace. 
Once the idea of consensus driven governance bootstrapping grand project builds and public infrastructure works becomes the norm, we'll wonder how on Earth we ever managed to do *anything* with hierarchical governance structures stymying group-lead 'leader*full*' and '*whole*sum' human progress.

Being 'noble' is all about what we carry in our hearts and minds in the end.  Recognise that money is just a temporary, fleeting thing and is not real wealth; what we do with it along the journey is far more important than how much of it we acquire... Try to bring more joy than sadness, leave the world a better place for you having been in it.  Go to bed at night worry free, knowing you've done your very best but can always do better as long as you keep learning.
None of that requires 'money'.  That's the reason those who have *real* wealth still get up and go to 'work' and 'school' of a morning ;)

Sure, which is why patience is needed to wait for more stability as the landscape starts to mature.  Remember how many times dotcom stocks crashed (down and up!) before it all started to make sense.
Look back to old Amazon charts and you see almost an exact mirror of BTC.
None of this can make sense until Google and all the silicon valley projects in stealth begin announcing.  
And they can't do that without fueling FOMO, so there's a lot of responsibility there to do this the right way and with caution because right now, without scale, bitcoin isn't ready for those big player announcements.
ICO clarity, Layer 2/3 rollouts and a unified approach to identity management will all pave the way toward atomic swap integrated apps becoming the way most tech savvy people (and companies) choose to conduct business.
In the meantime bitcoin will continue to be the gateway crypto to all this and will likely be the defacto settlement layer of the internet of money.
Whilst that plays out, we can but all enjoy the journey.

Tom is at least basing his predictions on some fairly sound methodology based on [the diffusion of innovations]( (analysing search volume / wallet signups / user activity) which is a lot more sound than standard chart modelling.
But he's also been humble enough to say it's far from an exact science since there are way too many external variables affecting all this (hence his revised prediction above).
Bottom-Line: Long term fundamentals with the technology and infrastructure being built around it has never looked better and with the millions of ordinary people signing up and learning about all this in Q4 last year, and the massive exponential growth we've seen with r/bitcoin subscribers (which is often ground zero for bitcoin outreach)... It seems with a little more maturation on the UX side of all this and layer 2/3 tech roll-out (which is happening a lot faster than anyone expected) 2018 may be the year bitcoin finally ['crosses the chasm'](
So much of this is down to psychology and collective belief in the adjacent possible, that a lot of all this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of course.

Yeah.  I think what we're seeing is Oracle DB / Microsoft vs. MySql / Linux.  Question is whether governments learn from recent history such as the abject failure of closed systems running critical infrastructure like the NHS or whether they fall for the shiny sales patter.
Certainly, Microsoft have learnt from their cockups: Daniel Buchner (who was once on the Mozilla side of the 'browser wars') is working on decentralised identity for Microsoft and is a huge supporter of open blockchains like bitcoin.  In addition computer scientist, Andreas Antonopoulos has been [advising governments]( and the finance industry on all this for years.   
Both the UK chief science advisor and the bank of England research team seem to be well ahead the pack on all this, essentially arguing the open nature of bitcoin need not be feared or innovation stifled providing they keep up with the need to combat illicit use.  Lagarde (head of IMF) said similar stuff about crypto only a few days ago. 
Do take a moment to read CSW's [blog post]( if you get a chance.  Try to ignore the personality and vested interests behind his message and rather judge it on the merit of the content.  
Whilst it is laden with knee-jerk FUD that politicians lower in the hierarchy and with less access to good information may well fall for, Craig *does* bring up some important and valid points that need to be addressed.  Sadly, he neglects to mention the fact law enforcement agencies *already* have ample resources to trace illegal activity on the open public ledger that is the bitcoin blockchain; as the Silkroad closure can attest.  
Both the chief of the UK [Metropolitan police]( and the latest Bank of England research are clear that it's much harder for criminals to use bitcoin and get away it than it is say, cash or a Swiss bank account.
As for Bitcoin being another Wall St.  Worth catching Caitlin Long (Ex managing Director of Morgan Stanley / Credit Suisse) who recently spoke about how Bitcoin's open nature ultimately leads to [The End of Wall St. Fraud]( 
So... whilst Craig may think that creating an Apple style walled garden around bitcoin is the solution (with he and nChain as head gatekeepers)... we all know that eventually leads to a totalitarian state lead by well meaning [do-gooders]( who end up choking human creativity and freedom.
Just imagine if the printing presses had been controlled by only a small few because of the propensity for a few 'rascals' to write about 'bad things' that went against the church :/  Had [book burning]( persisted, we'd have had no 'On the Origin of the Species' and definitely no 'Paris Hilton: Life on the Edge' :D
Which is **exactly** why British computer scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee released the internet for free and without a patent.  Since he knew had he not there would now be 1,000 different corporate controlled internets - all owned by different stakeholders with varying degrees of censorship and access/territorial restrictions, meaning citizens around the globe would have no one single access point to universal truth.
So who are the UK government going to listen to in the end?  CSW or the computer scientist that invented the world wide web who long ago tweeted out his bitcoin powered [Blockstack ID]( and, ostensibly, gave bitcoin and open and adaptive systems built on top of it, a giant digital thumbs up.
*“When I invented the web, I didn’t have to ask Vint Cerf [the ‘father of the internet’] for permission to use the internet,” said Berners-Lee, who previously stated that the internet should remain a “permissionless space for creativity, innovation and free expression”. — [Timbo on the future of the web](

People certainly do have fear... society en masse always fears the unknown, which is why it takes a few 'free radicals' to break away from the established order and pull the rest of humanity forward...  
Prior to bitcoin people were afraid to put their money on this new invention called debit and credit cards...
The points you bring up were debates being had some 5 years ago in here and at conferences where the average person hadn't even heard the word bitcoin. 


Sure, there's no major issue with legacy payment technology in the West that bitcoin in its current form needs (or can) solve just yet.  First it needs to scale via additional protocol initiatives like lightning network, just as the internet IP backbone needed additional protocols to handle stuff like email and video streaming.
I expect visa at al to eventually get onboard the train and create their own bitcoin sidechains that embraces all this through LN and other layer 2/3 drives... but bitcoin wasn't invented  to fix first world retail problems....
It's important to see that bitcoin is not magic fairy dust that will fix everything, any more than the internet was.  
It has the propensity to help end greed and corruption if harnessed in the right way, and remove gatekeepers that have been stockpiling wealth, seizing up resource access, and creating all kinds of barriers for the ordinary citizen to achieve true social mobility.  Barriers exploited through complex for financial instruments that have lead to a two tier justice system and a middle 'class' squeezed so tightly the West is at a similar place today as we were in days gone by where only a debt jubilee could fix the decay.
That greed and corruption of the incumbents is more due to lack of imagination that comes from seeing this as a dog eat dog race for survival when the truth is, the more equal we are the better off everyone is, including those at the 'top'.
We need patience for all this to start becoming self evident to the global populace...  Bitcoin's first major impact will be on the internet itself as the backbone of Web 3.0.  In fact I doubt many people will even recognise the internet by 2020.
It will of course have a *massive* positive impact on the 4 billion people on the planet that are yet to get online.  As SoftBank, Google, Tesla, Vodafone, Nokia and Huawei work to address that, we'll no doubt see those 4 billion unbanked people skipping legacy tech like debit cards and hooking straight into the global bitcoin tradenets via lightning and sidechain technology.
After that, it will likely become a payment instrument in the West, working seamlessly alongside legacy banking infrastructure... with tech like blockstack bolted on top we'll then see Web 3.0 tech fixing things like true global citizenship and immutable encrypted data repositories.

As Einstein often pointed out, imagination is far more important than intelligence, since imagination "embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution." 
As such, the worst evil in this world is often committed by highly intelligent people with good intentions but little by way of imagination.
Those good intentions are no use if you look at the world as one big zero sum game.  Bitcoin was invented to help snap humanity out of those knee jerk 'fight or flight' palaeolithic emotional responses.
*"The most important choice we can make is whether we choose to believe we live in a friendly or hostile universe."* – Albert Einstein
Bitcoiners got this far by staying peaceful and being the change we want to see in the world.
That process begins when we turn off the TV / Newspaper / Facebook / YouTube echo chambers and begin to see the emperors are as naked as the rest of us.  
Yes, they too stare at the same stars and have no more clue than you or I do as to what all this is about.  Isn't getting the entire of humanity into the stars and finding answers what all this is about really?
We must take ownership of the thoughts in our own heads back, and begin thinking for ourselves if we are to achieve the diversity in thought and imagination we need to fulfil that destiny.

Agreed, which is why a B2X fork being run by those linked to blockchain analysis startups and middleware payment gateways was such a concern.
If we are to see the main protocol as a settlement layer then the kinds of privacy solutions we all need, should be applied to sidechains, where the vast majority of transactions will be occurring.
I expect layer 2/3 tech and initiatives like blockstack to allow for separate encrypted layers of data protection and decentralised storage not subject to data breaches... such that you do not have to give your data to anyone you don't trust. 
The upside to such a system being in place, is we can still expect full transparency from public institutions, charities and corporations... which can be vetted and audited out in the open.
We also get to see where every penny we contribute to society is being spent in real-time and allows individuals to adjust their contributions according to the things they care about.
In a way, we're just applying the concept of crowdfunding to everything that happens in local and central government and exposing it all to the scrutiny of the public who are contributing... which sounds fair enough given it's called the public purse for a reason ;)
Contributing to this purse and actually seeing your money being put to good use then becomes a point of pride as opposed to something the populace does out of fear.  
Charities would not exist if citizens didn't take pride in giving and helping those less fortunate.
So all we're really doing here is taking the old paper system and upgrading it for a digital age, getting rid of inefficiencies and the temptations that lead to the less privileged being exploited and freeing capital by 'allowing' individuals to move their energy around more freely and openly... As those networks gather momentum, all this leads to a world where physical borders become all but obsolete and the idea of a global citizenship gets closer to reality.

First of all, there is no "they", only "us".  Bitcoin has already broken through the "and then they fight you" stage.  We really need to stop thinking of this as a fight or giving airtime to those arrogant naysayers who think they are involved in some kind of gladiatorial dispute.  There can be no winners or losers for it is not a race.
When those subsumed by greed in the banking industry nearly plunged the world into the dark ages in 2008, how many of those in 'power' (in government) clapped their hands in glee and how many said 'holy shit, I did not realise we were this close to the brink'?  How many of those politicians working in the light have been crying out for a solution that brings us out of the darkness?  More than you think, for they are the quiet ones that don't feel the need to go on CNBC as modern day emperors with no clothes, espousing their warped views of reality from the dusty recesses of their own vanity.
The quiet ones: those in the chambers of 'power' knee-deep in paperwork as they hold onto these decaying reigns in the hope that we will help them find a better way.  You want to see the highest concentration of those people, you need only look across the atlantic, away from the neon glare of one-upmanship and big business politics of the U.S. and see what is happening in the UK.
A country that founded the welfare state, free healthcare for all and, where a law can be changed overnight.  Far from preventing bitcoin, "they" are welcoming this new economic era with open arms.  See [Zac Goldsmith's comments]( and read between the lines if you want to get an idea of the real political discord going on between "them" and those banks that nearly ran this world into the ground.  See the then Prime Minister [David Cameron, flying around the world with Blockchain.info]( and fill in the blanks.
The world is rudderless.  No-one is in control.  If we come to truly understand this and dare to dream of a fearless new future then that future remains in our hands, for as long as we are willing to accept we cannot control it any more than we can bend a spoon that doesn't yet exist.

Consider the following scenario.
*You've just arrived late at night in a remote village in Africa after a lengthy flight.  You get to your hotel check-in desk, only to find your bank card is blocked as you failed to inform them you were travelling abroad and it's being flagged as suspicious activity.  The only ATM in the village is in a little shop that is closed.  The hotel owner is insisting on payment upfront and tells you she is about to close reception for the night.*
After a very costly and lengthy call to your bank, where you have just had to divulge your personal details and answers to your security questions (overheard by everyone in the hotel lobby), the bank tells you it will take up to 2 hours for the block to be removed.
*Without bitcoin*
The hotel owner once again insists on payment and tells you she's closing the desk if you cannot make payment.  You end up facing a cold night on the streets in an unfamiliar place...
*With bitcoin* 
You notice the bitcoin accepted here sign on the checkout desk, text your Dad the hotel's bitcoin wallet address and explain the situation.  Within a few seconds your Dad has secured the room from halfway around the world without having to even make a phone call.  You sleep snugly in the bed and your African vacation is saved.
(This card blocking is a common bugbear travellers face btw, happens all the time).   
There are many more scenarios where 'money with wings' is saving the day, including corrupt regimes and countries with runaway inflation that have turned to enforcing capital controls over the people...  But even from an ordinary Western merchant standpoint, bitcoin is helping alleviate small business owners from onerous transaction charges imposed by banks at point of sale terminals (there can be no chargebacks with bitcoin and merchants are finding that allocating a small amount of sales in bitcoin and being prepared to HODL is helping them compete with larger stores that have little to no fees by virtue of their special relationship with the bank).   
And of course, there are lots of cool things bitcoin is making possible on the internet (micropayments via lightning for instance) that is set to enable all kinds of hitherto unforeseen solutions to problems we didn't even know existed!  
The idea of digital scarcity being a thing for the first time ever in history is mind blowing.  Imagine a World of Warcraft game in VR and being able to create one of a kind goods.  Cryptokittes is an early precursor to this kind of thing.
As with internet and mp3, time will tell how all these beautiful ideas unfold.

Lightning's internet home is  where you will find the whitepaper and links to discussion channels within the LN community.
Sidechain Elements Alpha you will find here:
Atomic swaps running over LN will play a big role in all this.  Charlie Lee (Litecoin/ex-Google) laid out a rather beautiful vision for this and performed the first successful LTC swap over LN a number of months ago.

There are lots of alts out there, each with different ideas about how all this should work.  r/bitcoin does not feel the need to mention them on a daily basis.
I feel compelled to paste a quote from Henry Thomas Buckle.  It's relevant to the groups in r/btc slinging mud, just as it is those in r/bitcoin slinging it back.
We'd do well to rise above it and *focus* on the ideas in this space capable of pulling the entire of humanity forward.

Traditionally, gender difference is *taught* (boys play cowboys and Indians, girls play dress up and homemaker).  Those generations that grew up on the internet were not taught these differences, free as we were to be *anyone* behind an online handle.
What we're dealing with is an inter-generational clash that can't understand a world without labels, status and hierarchy.
The future of crypto is certainly those in touch with the more nurturing and caring sides we all have within us... and the most successful will be those who wield this tech to positively transform the lives of billions of ordinary people around the globe.

Perhaps you are right.  I have been wrong about bitcoin many times before (as has Andreas, who is the first to be humble enough to admit so whenever I've seen him speak).  
Where bitcoin is headed is no more up to me than it is you.  As such, I'm more than happy to be wrong and allow my views on all this to remain in a state of flux.  There are way too many variables at play here for any one of us to be able to think more than a few months ahead.
We can but do our best - listen to others views on all this - and let go of that innate urge to feel the need to control, whilst trusting the ecosystem as a whole to figure it out.

Bitcoin will indeed change. Infact, just like HTML and TCP/IP it is changing and being upgraded practically every day.  Not to mention sidechain tech and progress being made on other open blockchains like Ethereum.  Everything is still wide open.  Which is very, very healthy.
Banks too will change to stay relevant, just as blockbuster video, telephone companies and even the original telegram services like Western Union had to change to keep up with technological progress.


Why would they need a backdoor when they have a public ledger?  Bitcoin is already infinitely more traceable than cash and Swiss bank accounts.


I often leave my debit card safely at home when I go out and just use my phone and Android pay via NFC.  In the future I doubt we'll even need that.  Facial recognition and finger print scanners may well do the trick in a world where there's a blockstack like solution that keeps that kind of private data encryped and decentralised.
Indeed, James D'Angelo specced out just such a facial recognition solution using bitcoin a few years back.  It was really neat idea.


Not in the UK they don't.  Last year multiple chains suffered POS and banking failures in a number of outages.  They had to resort to cash only.  Naturally, bitcoin/lightning would not have been affected by such failures.


Our ancestors said the same about the currency of the Roman Empire.  Eventually it became so debased, the Roman armies deserted.  That's the problem empires face when the only thing incentivising people to believe in the cause is money.  Incidentally, it's written "fiat" (no need to capitalise, that would be the car manufacturer logo people get confused with ;)).

Likewise quite what future governments and societies look like in a more free, open world on the cusp of being utterly revolutionised by digital platforms, is anyone's guess.

Perhaps it doesn't really matter whether we are trading in Bitcoin, $ bills, Google Pay, Seashells or Tally Sticks...  The old world can co-exist with the new (in fact it must) just as cash has co-existed alongside debit cards and the 96% of money that is already digital.  
What *does* matter, I feel, is that nefarious actors preying on the weak that think it's ok to lie and steal and cheat their way to the 'top' and gamble with the money of the vast majority of honest citizens in the world are no longer incentivised to do so in the brave new world we are all building here.
As for the crystal ball, Tom is at least basing his predictions on some fairly sound methodology (that follows the diffusion of innovations) and has actually been humble enough to say there are far too many variables to be certain of any of this (hence his revised prediction).
There's a few short-term hurdles to cross with G20 and the alt/ICO shakeout we're witnessing, which will see those who only got into this to make 'get rich quick' gains exiting, but long term fundamentals with the technology and infrastructure being built around it has never looked better.  
Similarly, the millions of ordinary people signing up and learning about all this in Q4 last year tells us we're about to ['cross the chasm']( once those last few hurdles are traversed.
When we do, bitcoin will be very boring and we'll all be missing these crazy days :)

But there's plenty of hints being dropped by them all if you read between the lines...
It's gonna' take everyone time as all this matures, just as it took time for the (now old) neckbeards to figure out what amazing things could be built when the dreams of Web 2.0 finally became feasible.  
Meanwhile the internet as we know it is very *broken* and everyone is having to think very deeply about the Social Responsibility that comes with all this and the huge global impact of unleashing tech that can move billions of micro transactions per second (and people's data that will eventually be held in these decentralised services).  This game isn't about money and shareholder meetings any more; it's about avoiding the mistakes those who thought it was about money made on the internet.  
After all, it was that "it's all about the Benjamins!" mindset that lead to the need for bitcoin in the first place.

Yes they do, and indeed younger generations are, but not through force - through self-lead education and the realisation that what they consume has a real impact, not just on themselves but the world around them.


That's already happened.  Microphones too.  Read Ed Snowden's leaks and Vault7 to get an inkling of how far this has already gone. 
This level of surveillance has been abused in many jurisdictions by the watchmen; in others things like data protection laws have just about been able to keep up to ensure the stark predictions of George Orwell didn't eventually come to pass.  
The UK is the most CCTV'd nation on Earth.  But those cameras have been used to watch the watchmen as much as everyone else.  Data protection laws have ensured that every citizen has the right to request footage being taken should they so desire.  Police body cams in the U.S. in places like Arizona saw police complaints going down some 70%.  
As each citizen is now armed with their own HD camera, and live streaming TV studio we further see mass surveillance being democratised and passed onto the crowd themselves.  
None of this technology is a one-size fits all glove; be that bitcoin or the technology of video monitoring.  Its adoption matures according to the distinct and ever-evolving set of cultural values and norms within each jurisdiction.  It is for that reason contactless card technology can work in the UK, but not in other places... Similarly, you can pick up a mobile phone and sim card there without filling in KYC - same is not true of India or France even where even connecting to public Wi-Fi often requires you to fill in KYC details.
Bitcoin offers us an opportunity to change all this; to build a system of liquid democracy based on consensus and the wisdom of well informed crowds decoupled from states and idealogical viewpoints... In my view, that can only happen if it evolves in the light.
But then that's the beauty of all this.  My view doesn't matter any more than yours does.

FWIW, I'm with Nikolas Tesla who predicted all of this many years ago.
I look forward to the day we can all move through cyberspace and meatspace as individual *people* and it becomes self evident to all that there being a difference between those of varying race, gender, sexual orientation, social class is something that has been erroneously *taught* (which neuroscience now backs up).   
But the fact people around the world are even having this conversation tells us that, just like the time before civil rights, the world is not quite there yet.

Eventually, as all those youngsters graduate and get jobs that pay in bitcoin and adopt things like BitWage to request their fiat salaries come in BTC, we move toward a world where things are priced in bits and millibits and then fiat has less of a hold on the subconscious as we begin to equate actual value of 'things' with bitcoin.  Kinda' like how in countries adopting the euro they would dual price things in local currency and euros a whole year before roll-out so people got used to doing the mental gymnastics needed to figure out 'value'.  As bitcoin becomes more and more stable for that kind of thing, we can expect shops and websites that want to appeal to an increasingly tech savvy younger demographic to do the same thing with bits and millibits.  
Over a long enough timeline as physical cash is phased out and fiat becomes less and less used everyday it should - in theory at least - become less and less debased as it will be less open to abuse and fraud, and far easier to monitor.  
So, if Grandpa Laggard wants to be using his USD debit card in 20 years time it should all work itself out, even if the backend system clearing his payment is doing it over the bitcoin settlement layer on a USD sidechain.  After all, you don't chastise people for still using the antiquated technology of cheque books; you just raise your eyebrow and wonder what century they're living in :p
Meanwhile the entire populace is being weaned off the "spend now pay later" credit and debt racket and we become much more conscious consumers and more thoughtful about our impact in the world.  We're gonna' start asking questions like "why does everyone on the same street need their own lawnmower when we each only use it 1 hour a month?"  We're gonna' ask "why it is our automobiles stay idle in work car parks 9-5 each day for 95% of their lifespan?".  Crypto will enable us to do far better monitoring of resources in this manner and distribute them more evenly across populaces as we get closer to the resource based sharing economy that we so desperately need.
So... As we think about how all that is going to play out over the next few decades we come to the realisation that everything is as it should be and that, ultimately, the entire economy will rather cleanly self correct as it gives way to a new and far more efficient system that has more of the old system's strengths but far fewer of its weaknesses.

I'm a scientist: I primarily read journals, not entertainment coverage.  His thinking is based on old models of how we thought the brain developed before advances in neuroscience.
Psychology and, in particular the DSM that inormed a lot of those old theories is looking more and more like pseudo-science.
Humanity at large is not ready to hear a lot of these things, since those scientists have had the same exalted status as the clergy of old before Darwin came along, forcing us all to rethink those inter-subjective truths we held so dear.
It also doesn't help that peer review in that old world is completely broken.
Satoshi of course has challenged a different hierarchical structure peddling pseudo-science that held the same exalted status (economists) and, as we are witnessing, many are going back to the drawing board.  
But it has taken 9 years for that process of realisation to start happening, just as it has taken many years for things like gay marriage to finally sweep away the cobwebs of that old medieval mindset.
In the end, best to stick to maths.

I hope this gets cracked too eventually.
We know it's possible from a software engineering point of view: [Gridcoin]( piggybacks BOINC which powers folding and contributes home computing power to SETI etc.
In the meantime, as consumer level chips get closer to reality, perhaps we will eventually see mining chips in everything from laptops and smartphones to lightbulbs and toasters.  
If all that computing power was then flipped to doing something useful at some point in the future, perhaps there is no harm right now in bitcoin helping to build the biggest distributed computing network in the history of mankind?
Fast forward a decade and perhaps the notion of us all typing on laptops and smartphones made of actual physical *stuff* will be like spinning up a CD is to the MP3 generation...  It may be simply a matter of logging into our augmented reality 'laptops', and renting a few cycles on the global cloud compute grid bitcoin created?

Bitcoin was not invented to fix 1st world retail problems any more than the internet was invented as a means for newspapers to be published faster.
Nor does it care about politics, borders, race, gender or nationality.  Any more than the technology behind Reddit or the internet does.
Money is just information; the sooner we all come to terms with the fact we never should have been paying gatekeepers for the 'privilege' of freely exchanging this information with fellow peaceable humans... the sooner we can all get to grips with the realisation we can now move that 'money as information' as easily as we can send an email or text message.

Ah, I remember introducing my parents to this thing we called a 'computer mouse' and wondering whether old folks would ever understand this new thing called computers...  Now I regularly see people in their 70's at airport lounges happily skyping away with their loved ones via these supercomputers we call a tablet.
If people see enough value in the technology, they will go out their way to learn new skills even if they find it difficult at first (no matter what the age).  
But, just as we couldn't foist PC's and computer mice on unsuspecting secretaries in the 80's and 90's and force them to start using wordperfect rather than their typewriters... so too must we have patience with that older generation who are not yet comfortable enough to be able to embrace crypto without potentially firing off their life savings into the nether-sphere.

A good analogy is bitcoin being where the internet was circa 1995.  For those of us who remember that period, everyday right now is like déjà vu.

Right, exactly... But that's just called carrying out the will of the people.  One does not have to carry a pitch fork to make that happen, it just requires convincing enough local councillors and maybe a science advisor or two, that this is the way forward ;)
What I'm talking about has been called "Glass Governance" by the UK government chief science advisor btw.
Of course, the ultimate end goal of all this is a system that removes the need for traditional governments entirely.  
This doesn't have to be forced either; imagine a billion micro pineapple funds running in tandem and people powered crowdfunding groups emerging everywhere simultaneously...  
Instead of waiting a year for the council to clear the budget for building a new school, it can happen overnight.  All those empty shops and houses decaying because noone can afford to put them to use?  All it needs is a good idea the local crowd backs to get them going again.
Then we begin to ask, what do we need government for?

At no point did I argue we shouldn't have a right to privacy, I merely pointed out concerns whether this should be baked into the base layer (the pseudonymous nature of which already affords privacy), or whether alts like monero are better at serving those needing to shield their assets from authoritarian regimes in the interim, as we await well thought out solutions via layer 2/3 that allow us to encrypt *all* our data, instead of allowing unelected representatives to abuse that data (as in the case of the Equifax breach).


If my proffering an opinion on a technology I've dedicated the last 6 years of my life to, in a democratic forum where minds are encouraged to think aloud is of concern to you then that's very worrying indeed.
As for the surveillance coin comment, I'm arguing for no changes to bitcoin at all.  And, last time I checked, the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin hasn't lead (in the last 9 years) to huge state overreach in any jurisdiction at all.
That's not to say it won't, or that we shouldn't have backup plans or be mindful of the potential problems ahead, which is why everyone should be encouraged to think outloud.  
I have said several times that my views are no more important or valid than others on this forum.  It is therefore up to each of us to think about the points raised and form our own opinions.

Again, I would urge you do the research before making bold pronouncements like this.  
You might want to research the Byzantine General's problem and why solving the Double Spend problem is probably one of the greatest breakthroughs in science since the internet itself.
In addition, a money based on true digital scarcity that is impossible to counterfeit, has a fixed supply, is censorship resistant, and is not subject to the whims of fallible men and women inflating money behind closed doors are other factors that sets bitcoin apart from fiat.  
The [Bitcoin Standard]( by Saifedean Ammous is a fabulous read that may help with your research on the above.


Easy to say in hindsight; yet was something Paul Krugman and even tech 'experts' like Bill Gates missed at the time.  The lesson to be learnt there is "when a large group of highly intelligent people like computer scientists are all very excited about something in their field that they've been researching for years, perhaps you ought listen to them over the naysayers and latecomers outside of their field."...  And you especially ought listen to the wayseers that built the internet (and ignored the 'experts' and general public who labelled it nothing but a fad) the first time all this happened.
Needless to say, there are many 1000's of computer scientists around the globe very, very excited about bitcoin, including good ol' Steve Wozniak (the engineer behind apple) not to mention, basically the entire of MIT (who have been fundamental in helping shape, design and architect sidechain technologies being built atop of bitcoin).

Yes, hence adhoc LETS economies that were bootstrapped in places like Spain and Greece after the bank failures.  Many of them run on nothing but basic spreadsheets keeping track of resources and hours worked.
Interesting to view bitcoin's original roots in the dark web as a sort of dry run to see how groups will self organise when given ultimate sovereignty over their own wealth.

Good points and you get no argument from me there.  
However, the prospect of a hard fork and another vision competing for the 'name' might be viewed as a safeguard against a nefarious actor or group of actors deliberately holding back that consensus, which is what we saw with Segwit for nigh on 3 years.  
This is a slow game if you're looking ten years down the line, but seems to me the balance of power is just right to ensure the ecosystem will figure out the best way forward after lots of stumbling about.  Has to be that way if everyone is to be given an equal share of voice.
I'll just be glad when we see really transformative solutions being built on the frontend; it will be those ideas, apps and services that ordinary users fall in love with that will really decide all this.
What's going on under the hood of bitcoin will be as relevant to them as ipv4 is; if the crowd have some cool new toys to play with on the front end they'll be more inclined to focus attention there as opposed to impatiently weighing in on highly technical matters under the hood... which will mean techies can focus on the tech rather than constantly having to drop everything to deal with the latest twitterstorm :p

For those that weren't here in the early days I feel it's important to point out that bitpay played a crucial role in helping get us to were we are today.    
We were able to use them as an example of a 'professional' company able to comply with onerous old world regulation whilst providing a quick and simple means for merchants to onboard and shield revenues from volatility.  
Can't underscore how important they were in enabling us to refute FUD with real world examples, especially on the volatility questions.  It was a tremendous struggle back then to get Bitcoin taken seriously and safeguard its future and there is no doubt at all without bitpay things would have been much harder.
Think of them as you might AOL online.  AOL sure did suck once we all had a choice to move to a freer internet, but I was eternally grateful they were there at the beginning and able to give me 50hrs of free internet access each month before dialup became truly affordable.
Will bitpay pivot and further evolve?  Perhaps when bitcoin / lightning have matured further and there's a clear technology stack and roadmap.  Same goes for Coinbase and all the others providing a safe little bridge between old world and new systems enabling less technically minded people (such as merchants) to onboard safely.
Many in here who want an anarcho capitalist free for all ought be mindful there are two systems that need to be catered for here and a whole bunch of old world regulation certain companies are needing to comply with in order to find their niche in the ecosystem.  Bitcoin is not getting your gas tank filled *yet*, nor running the systems that got the supermarket food from some far away country onto Western dinner tables. 
Black and white thinkers out there who don't see the nuances cited above should simply use the myriad other bitcoin payment options out there and be grateful there's so much choice to cater to every need and outlook.
If bitcoin is to work for everyone both those 'sdes' need to coexist peacefully as we make the slow transition to the new world many of us yearn to see.  
Meanwhile the programmers and engineers building that future still need to be fed by systems intersecting the old world.  
Ironic to think I used to order pizza from JustEat when bitpay were the only guys in the world enabling that to happen and now here we are 5 years later dealing with people who have no knowledge of those days or just how far we've come in this space, nor respect for the mavericks that paved the way.

Yes.  Trump himself hinted he might one day run many, many years ago (there's a whole bunch of old talk show interviews where he's asked the president question) .  "Trump for prez" was then a running 'joke' for over two decades, especially in NY business / showbiz circles.  So the Simpsons didn't predict anything; the writing team just picked out the most outrageous propechy that was already a part of popular culture to generate a few giggles... which then added weight to the notion itself.  
Once Trump began believing it was truly possible, the seed was planted.  As he himself once said "I knew this day would come, it was only a question of when".
Since everything is based on belief, this is a perfect example of how self fulfilling propeheies work and how ideas (memes) begin to spread.

Bitcoin is just a movement of people united by an idea.  Like any family, we fall out, we do and say stupid shit but we stick together when the old world turns the screws.
We all have a lot more in common with one another than we do differences.  And nearly all the spats boil down to misunderstandings and badly executed ideas.
That's the point of all this.  If one day, the technology behind bitcoin is going to be running a global decentralised governance platform everyone has a voice on, then it needs to survive intense disagreements like this, but also be capable of bringing everyone back together so we can pool brainpower and shared resources on the things we do agree on.
That requires humility from both 'winning' and 'losing' 'sides'.

I'm pretty sure that wasn't the strategy; it's just the business side they're a part of failed to see the importance of IRC / GitHub / mailing lists and recognise that many involved here aren't interested in boardroom meetings and business plans, nor doing 9-5.  That can be pretty frustrating for both 'sides', especially when each believes they have the best interests of everyone at heart but neither are reading each others 'workings out'. 
It's also endemic of the changing nature of work, even Jack at Twitter recognises the rise of 'digital nomads' is going to mean an end to 9-5, office spaces and boardroom meetings.
Jeff's 'side' also didn't grok how much sway the grassroots community has in an this.  
Nor did any of us know for sure really: this entire project - since the moment wikileaks blew bitcoin's 'cover' - has been a trial by fire.  A level of chaos to be expected given so many varied participants / ideas and worldviews.
For much of this debacle, Hanlon's razor applies here to anyone able to look at these events dispassionately.
*Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. In simpler words: some bad things happen not because of people having bad intentions, but because they did not think it through properly.*
As I say, very hard to think anything through properly unless both 'sides' have access to all the information.
Brexit, the wall, this illusory red/blue democracy that requires an opposing tribe to function - it's all the same.  Participants in the charade slumber in Plato's Cave whilst engineers and free thinkers just get on with fixing the mess everyone else blames each other for (without recognising it is this devisive blame game holding *everyone* back and creating the very problems being argued over).  This goes on until the ecosystem evolves and humanity finally steps out the cave and we find the world has changed before our very eyes, barely even remembering once being opposed to the (now self evident) reality before us.
Bitpay is what it is.  It serves a useful purpose within the current ecosystem, as does Ethereum, Coinbase and other infrastructure projects that are able to cater to the needs of the (necessarily) less chaotic/anarchistic paperbelt world looking to find their feet in all this.  Bitcoin is for that world as much as it is the new collaborative world it all gives rise to.  More the two 'sides' fight, longer it takes for both to get to the promised land.
For anyone opposed to that, there are plenty choices out there now.  So light a candle instead of complaining about the darkness in that cave.  Because, perhaps, just maybe, the shadows you see don't reveal the full picture of what's actually going on.

This is kinda' like the browser wars all over again.  Did we ever really need more than one web browser?
I have no idea how many hours of my life I, and many other devs have lost over the years to debugging perfectly good code that refused to run on IE5 and the myriad other broken browser implementations...  
One must wonder what might have happened during those days (had big business and 'competition' not fuelled that madness) how more advanced the internet would be had those wasted programming hours lost to debugging actually been spent working on creative endeavours.
Let's hope something positive comes out of 'self regulation' and not a repeat of the bitcoin foundation and the kind of 'power' plays we saw when exchanges and other big businesses in this space tried to flex their muscles during last years B2X debacle... 
*Things to consider...*
As with web browsers... Do we really need more than one fully peer-reviewed and open source exchange engine running on the back end given they all do practically the same job?  Some kind of basic exchange protocol that deals with the core functionality they all share in common might be a step in the right direction here.
I note that some of the oldest exchanges that have stood the test of time to date have practically the same API, so it's fair to assume there's been a large degree of coding collaboration already behind the scenes.  Bringing that code into the light to be checked by peers seems to be better than obfuscation.  
It's fair to assume then that industry-wide collaboration in this manner will allow for faster roll-out of new code and ideas, and a more unified approach that will see less confusion (and greater trust) amongst ordinary consumers.
Things like Segwit compatibility and batching is then something all exchanges can release in one fully-tested roll out, rather than leaving it to individual team members who may well make mistakes.
As for self-regulation: surely a set of 'best common-sense practices' that all exchanges follow to safeguard users' funds is the solution?  
Perhaps an industry-wide 'kite-mark' along the lines of trust-pilot (that fully vetted participants of the ecosystem can display on their site via a bitcoin.org plugin or something similar) is the way to go?  And by vetted, I mean actually vetted by trusted coders and developers that have been safeguarding and peer-reviewing core releases the last 9 years and have no vested interest or stake on the business side of all this.

This was all tackled about 5 years ago but glad to see the discussion being opened to a more mainstream audience.
Before everyone gets in a knee-jerk panic about all this: the same applies to practically *any* site an unsuspecting individual may visit that contains links to circumspect stuff.  This is not grounds for blocking the entire internet or arresting internet surfers for having landed upon one of those sites.  
There are plenty of solutions in place for figuring out those who are actually engaging with and propagating that stuff through the darkweb and other places where 99.9999% of this is going to be happening... 
Are we going to argue that books and public libraries that contain potentially subversive stuff should also be banned?  What about 4Chan / Bittorrent / Youtube / Google?
Or has humanity actually learnt its lessons from the many other times in history we thought it a good idea to burn a whole bunch of information?
There are pros and cons to every new technology.  
The case for having an immutable global public ledger in time that the whole of humanity can write to without an invading army coming in and deleting / rewriting history, far outweighs the lame and stupid stuff people are going to inevitably do with that technology as it matures.

Well, you perhaps forget that one of the first things the internet did was to democratise intelligence.  
Clearly, with [Gavin meeting the CIA back in 2011]( and everyone from heartland payments, bank of america, paypal and the federal reserve being present, you would think that if intelligence agents were actually worried about all this, then back at the very beginning before the world had heard of bitcoin would be the time to stop it.  We know of course from the Snowden leaks that the NSA and practically every other intel agency on the planet would have known about bitcoin from day one.  
And yet here we are... it wasn't stopped.  
So, really it doesn't matter too much what special interest groups or governments who don't understand technology 'want', because there are multiple higher powers at work who *do* understand the technology - and spend their days thinking long and hard about the risks - who are constantly 10 steps ahead of the rest. 


And yet there is no censorship in Hong Kong.  Why is that do you think?  Do you think it's OK that western governments block websites on behalf of copyright lobbyists?  Or take down hard-right websites?  Is there a difference between blocking websites and burning books?  Is some speech freer than others?  These are hard questions we all need to look at, regardless of where we might be on the planet, or what government regime we happen to be under.




Pseudo anonymity remains intact, as does its censorship resistance; there is no way of stopping a bitcoin transaction from occurring or someone moving it into monero if they so wish.  Likewise, there is no way of stopping someone from putting bitcoin in their head (via a brainwallet) and walking over a border with it.

This is what happens when the smartest programmers in the world just aren't too enamoured by their 9-5 anymore.  I'm reminded of that [Office Space scene]( with the two Bobs.
If you've created a proprietary closed loop system and the only way of incentivising people to secure that is to pay them then they'll only put in 8 hours of energy a day then head off home and forget about it.  
Even worse when you're working in a culture of paranoia and subterfuge.  It's just not that fun.  Banks then require outside contractors to check every single line of code incase there's a backdoor.  This grinds progress to a halt and innovation is basically null.  The vast cost of maintaining such a leaky bucket inevitably leads to the loss of clients, capital, credibility and customer trust and loyalty which makes it increasingly difficult to attract fresh talent.  
We'll look back at these days and wonder who on earth thought it would be a good idea to enlist thousands of programming teams competing against one another to create apps that all do essentially the same thing *very* poorly.
Only solution is open and adaptive peer reviewed systems that encourage a collaborative culture devoid of suspicion... and code that is scrutinised by the very best programmers on planet earth who are incentivised because they themselves are in love with (and are users of) the very product they are building.

*Brand Etymology*: Old English brand ‘burning’ (also in sense 3 of the noun), of Germanic origin; related to German Brand, also to burn. The verb sense ‘mark with a hot iron’ dates from late Middle English, giving rise to the noun sense ‘a mark of ownership made by branding’ (mid 17th century), whence sense 1 of the noun (early 19th century).
The practice of branding is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians who were known to have engaged in livestock branding as early as 2,700 BCE. Branding was used to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron.
*Copyright Origins*: The modern concept of copyright originated in Great Britain, in the year 1710, with the Statute of Anne. Under the Statute of Anne (1710), copyright term lasted 14 years plus an optional renewal of 14 additional years.
*Oldest 'Brand' in the World*: The Hoshi Ryokan hotel is the world's oldest continuously-operating business and thus probably the oldest (still existing) brand in the world. It was built in 718 AD and has been owned and run by the same family for 46 generations so far.

So exact same kind of monitoring that goes on everywhere else then. 
I lived in a communist country (Vietnam) back when bitcoin started to gain traction.  I worked from public wi-fi, in a public cafe and didn't hide anything I was doing.  
I talked about bitcoin openly even back in 2013, as did all the locals I interacted with, and nothing bad happened.  
In fact there's not a single story of massive state overreach involving *any* bitcoiner, from any country, communist or otherwise.


I'm not fighting against privacy.  I am saying those things should come with layer 2/3 tech and through alts tailored specifically to those needs.  I don't feel the need to use TOR to do all my web browsing, nor do I need Monero to purchase all my goods.  
But I'd quite like it if my government had no problem using an open ledger and being honest and open about the things they and the politicians that work for us are spending public money on.

Well we are yet to see what Internet giants like eBay, Alibaba, AirBnB, Google, Facebook, PayPal have planned yet.  
We know it appears Microsoft are building a sidechain on top of bitcoin for their passport sign in so that's a billion users there... eBay have said they're looking into bitcoin, Airbnb bought the bitcoin changetip team years ago... PayPal are looking into crypto and slipped bitcoin into one of their ads years ago...
So I'll guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens when the computer scientists behind these tech companies that defined the internet figure out where they stand on layer 2/3 tech.
It's gonna get very interesting when Alibaba and eBay can work seamlessly in crypto because there will be no fiat on/off ramp needed from producer-&gt;supplier-&gt;consumer.  Similarly with Airbnb and the real estate market.
It may all hinge around that Microsoft decentralised identity sidechain... or something like blockstack may be the solution... 
Google's unified payment API (which used bitcoin as an example currency in the dev how-to's) is another initiative that should help web developers streamline all this too.

Filtering out the noise in cyberspace can be tricky, as in our daily purchasing and consumption habits in meatspace... 
As a general rule of thumb, it's perhaps best to choose those companies that are embracing open source and are in love with the actual technology.
Android is open source.
Bitcoin Core is open source.
The Chromium browser project (which Chrome, and Brave browser (amongst many others) are based on) is open source and maintained by Google.
Googlers were amongst the first geeks to fall in love with bitcoin and help contribute to its growth.
Does that make Google and Alphabet perfect?  Nawww, they just comprise of ordinary, fallible humans trying very hard to keep the good spaceship earth afloat just like bitcoin core and those people working in the light in governments.
As for being 'forced' to use Google or other services; that's individual choice.  Just as it's your choice whether you use a company that is making ethnically sourced products or go with one that is cutting corners to keep prices down.
Your choice too whether you help push humanity toward Lambo or Tesla FOMO ��
Of course you have another option in all this.  You could choose to not use the internet and refuse to engage with any tech companies. 
After all, there are 4 billion people on the planet who go about their day to day lives without internet access at all, who have likely never even heard of Google.

I use Google Pay every single day.  In the UK you link it to your standard debit card and anywhere contactless card readers are (which is everywhere now) you just hold your phone out and the payment is made via NFC without you needing to fumble in your wallet for your card.  
It has the added benefit of keeping track of all your payments and is far more secure iirc, since Google generates a virtual card number without exposing your actual debit card number to the merchant.  You also have a cool little backup to your card / phone should you lose either one and get stuck.
Incidentally, there's actually a bitcoin wallet that piggybacks the same NFC / virtual card tech that allows you to spend bitcoin anywhere contactless cards are used; merchant sees it as a standard card transaction.  Not sure if it's out of alpha testing yet mind.

You're exactly right.  These are issues with usability, UX and public outreach that need to be addressed.  
It's very early days in this project in that regard.  At the moment bitcoin is useful as a safe store of value and for those nerds and tinkerers happy to play with early beta tech.
In that respect, we're kinda' where we were at the beginning of the internet when there were few email clients that didn't require UNIX skills, and the world's first web browser was still very clunky and hard to use...  Whilst Paul Krugman and other naysayers could see no longer term value in the internet ("people don't have that much to say to one another!") we could all clearly see a future of online commerce, music and film streaming and many of the other things that shape the web we see today.  We even saw the world of bitcoin and being able to billions of microtransactions on the web every second... But we understood in those very early days, that it would take another decade of work until that Web 1.0 / 2.0 vision would truly reach the masses via more user friendly, easy to digest solutions that anyone could pick up and get to grips with without a 'PhD in computer science' as you put it.
That's where we are with bitcoin (though I must say it's pretty simple for the uninitiated to use something like Coinbase, which we might regard as bitcoin's first 'hotmail' email client).  Essentially, if you can use a banking app on your phone, then you should be OK sending money with the coinbase app, or even something like Bread Wallet.  
Younger generations have been able to navigate the various idiosyncrasies of the tech pretty easily and take to apps and services rather intuitively and, indeed, are actively working on improving those UX issues on a daily basis.  Same with the waves of university students now all just learning about this new industry at places like UCL and MIT.  
Truth is... if you've not got the cognitive energy to invest at this stage, then I'd say the best advice is to come back in a few years when the UX kinks have been ironed out and it's looking less like Web 1.0 was back in the days of AOL and dial-up modems ;)
To us nerds and tinkerers though, figuring out how to shape all this from the ground-up when nothing quite works perfectly, is the funnest part :)  I of course appreciate that's not for everyone.

There's a big difference between following the *moral* law and following laws of the land (which are in a constant state of flux since law makers recognise were it not for the suffragettes, gay rights activists, abolitionists, we would have walked into totalitarianism a long time ago).
The issue is money and politics and the two tier justice system that has meant those at the top of the social strata have been able to bend laws via complex legal witchcraft and wizardry.
In such a scenario, as it was for the suffragettes and conscientious objectors, the only thing left is the moral law.

Free 'marketing' comes from word of mouth and people spreading an idea without monetary incentive.  Viral videos don't need a marketing budget to go 'viral'.  And neither do brilliant and transformative ideas.
Here's an [interesting Alan Moore essay]( on all this for those interested.
*"At the moment the people who are using Shamanism and magic to shape our culture are advertisers.   Rather than try to wake people up, their Shamanism is used as an opiate to tranquilize people, to make people more manipulable.  Their magic box of television, and by their magic words, their jingles can cause everyone in the country to be thinking the same words and have the same banal thoughts all at exactly the same moment...*
*Artists and writers have allowed themselves to be sold down the river.  They have accepted the prevailing belief that art and writing are merely forms of entertainment.  They’re not seen as transformative forces that can change a human being; that can change a society.  They are seen as simple entertainment; things with which we can fill 20 minutes, half an hour... It’s not the job of the artist to give the audience what the audience wants.  If the audience knew what they needed, then they wouldn’t be the audience.  They would be the artists.  It is the job of artists to give the audience what they need." — Alan Moore, author "The Watchmen"*

Nothing.  Money is just a measurement tool.  
The Bitcoin protocol (with a big B) is just a foolproof way of recording events.  The *real* magic is going to come through layer 2/3 built atop that protocol; the underlying fiat 'value' ascribed to bitcoin will eventually mean very little.
The only folks against the idea that the tools we use to measure and distribute wealth and resources might evolve into something that does a better job at that measuring are those that fail to recognise in a more egalitarian world they too would be better off.

For as long as we try to neatly define bitcoin and box it into a 'camp' or 'clan' (libertarian, cypherpunks or otherwise)... we continue to miss the point.  Bitcoin - the idea, cannot be owned by any group, any more than mathematics itself can be owned.
It's hard to grok this, but It's anti-fragility, like the internet, stems from the diverse melting pot of cultures and ideas that make up its users... Just as we don't need to know what religion, gender, social class or political views an eBay user has for us to trade with her, so is true of bitcoin users.
As such, bitcoin will ignore every idealogically driven attempt to define what it is or will become, including the original cypherpunk ethics that were required to bootstrap its existence from the shadows.
This creates friction as the idea spreads out of those shadows through a wider demographic, and those champions of the original core ethos (who all sang the same tune) now have to deal with an increasingly complex set of overlapping belief systems.  Such as Satoshi questioning whether supporting Wikileaks was the right thing to do, and then EFF dropping their early support.
This mirrors precisely events like the eternal September on usenet, which was a happy and sad turning point for many of the original internet dwellers, as it was clear to everyone involved that the technology was now reaching mainstream adoption.
But of course, in all this chaos we eventually find order; the EFF are now back onboard, and ordinary people all over the world are finding novel use cases for bitcoin, just as they did the internet.
Be prepared then, for bitcoin to be as commonplace and pedestrian as the internet itself.
The only question then for those who fought so hard for it to become reality need ask is: "now that it's all worked and there's nothing to fight for anymore, what shall we do next?"
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:06:32
Good points.  
There is no forced ethic beyond the "golden rule" - treat others as you yourself wish to be treated.  I choose to believe we live in a friendly universe and that most people will follow that rule.  It is, after all, the reason we have gotten this far as a species.
Bitcoin is not evolving in a technological vacuum and neither is Layer 2/3 tech.  You are right to bring up social networks.  The entire internet is very broken right now; primarily because it has had forced monetisation through advertisers, which those who first stepped into cyberspace all those decades ago, never envisaged.
So it is here in cyberspace that bitcoin will have its greatest initial impact allowing the crowd to reward real, quality content and initiatives, decoupled from big business interests or the enrichment of a few at the top of those businesses.  
That alone will mean citizens gain access to a greater range of truth and new models for restructuring the world around them, as we begin to filter out the noise carried by profit incentive, consumerism and slick marketing campaigns that proliferate the airwaves.
Governments are comprised of people; elected by the people to serve the people's interests and overseen by myriad civil servants that work outside of the glare of spotlight and cult of personality.  
Money and governance models are just social constructs that are constantly evolving alongside new technology.  
It is true that at the moment we exist between an old medieval paper world struggling to keep up with a rate of information exchange so fast, that we are on the brink of transcending to a Type I civilisation if we think carefully about the impact of all this.
I'm sure a decade from now, we will wonder what all the fuss was about :)

Again it's like asking postal workers in the 90s to explain the impact of email.  
As for his bumptious remarks that he's the *only* economic advisor to Netanyahu... that should immediately ring alarm bells since it means the top of that particular information hierarchy is only listening to one narrative, from a guy perplexed as to why his (likely well meaning) sexist remarks didn't garner audience laughter... and then goes on to wonder why they are lacking in female engineers (could it be something to do with the out of touch borderline sexist remarks perhaps?).
As for his analysis of the tech - he's still using near decade old arguments like "bitcoin is anonymous".  Seems he's getting the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin mixed up with the truly anonymous nature of cash.  As we all know, the bitcoin public ledger is infinitely more traceable than cash and the UK government have authored multiple reports detailing how easy it is for traditional intelligence / law enforcement agencies to keep track of illicit usage.  The silkroad case being a great example.
Forward thinking governments will soon (and indeed already are) hiring advisors who *actually* now have a near a decade of experience in the bitcoin industry, so that they may get a more balanced understanding of what's really happening.  The good news is, most of the computer scientists highly specialised in this industry also had to become expert economists along the way.   Andreas is a good example of this fusion in old/new world knowledge and a new emergent class of "E-conomist" that is cognitively equipped to give actual sound expert advice on matters discussed in the video above (hence Andreas' appearance at Canadian and U.S. senates to advise due to his UCL credentials and *real* qualitative expertise to speak in this domain).
Those governments relying solely on the opinion of 'postal workers' stuck in the status quo risk getting left behind, just as those who bought the Krugmanesque "the internet  will have no more effect on global business than the fax machine" ignorance during the world wide web revolution were very late to the party.  You don't hire car mechanics to advise on the intricacies of nuclear fusion reactors after all.
In the meanwhile, engineers and scientists from MIT to UCL and beyond will keep building on the bitcoin protocol and layer 2/3 solutions unabated, backed up by Tim Berners-Lee and others pushing decentralised Web 3.0 infrastructure projects like Blockstack and Solid which will all ultimately fold into the bitcoin ecosystem.
Eventually, well meaning postal workers and governments with good intentions will stop fearing change and see the light we all do once they start getting better access to information networks that truly understand new technology and the incredible opportunities for real, transformative change that lie ahead... just as they did when they successfully adapted to the open, borderless, censorship resistant, decentralised nature of the internet and the huge boon in trade, communication, research and academia that came with that.  Post offices and postal workers that initially resisted all that are still here of course, they just had to massively adapt and pivot to find a new role in it all.
In the meantime, the bitcoin engineers and scientists at MIT have a handy [price ticker]( to remind everyone that 1btc = 1btc.
TL;DR: no new arguments here that weren't debunked by science (and commonsense) many years ago.

Hong Kong is very much part of China, having been handed back by the Brits some two decades ago.  
In essence, your comment is like saying Wales is not part of Great Britain.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:02:53


OK, so let's think about why that happened.  Basically, the Brits were there until [Chris Patten]( handed China back in 1997 after a '99 year lease'.  That's right the Brits 'rented' hong kong like they might a house o_O
During that time the two cultures fused, traded art, music and food was swapped, which is why Chinese food is one of the Brits favourite foods even back home.  Over that 99 year period, the Chinese and Brits learnt a lot about how to get along with each other and the Brits exported things like the Beatles and, eventually, the internet and other technology from the west.  The Chinese came over to the UK, set up businesses and brought art (and lots of tea!), studied at Universities teaching their parents back home everything they had learnt.
And so slowly, we see cultures merge and evolve together.  It takes a few generations to figure out the mistakes their parents made and put things right, and to educate those that have been shut off from it all.
Right now, the Chinese mainland has people working for the rest of the world so we can have things like computers and cheap plastic trinkets for our Christmas crackers.  During the industrial revolution in the UK, that kind of work was outsourced to child labourers and in the U.S. black slaves were used to tend to cotton farms and the like.  None of that happened very long ago.  And yet today we find the idea of black people and children being forced into slavery abhorrent.  
Might future generations feel the same revulsion about the way Chinese workers have been used by the west to fuel consumerism? 
Think why it is documents are classified for 50 years or more.  When we read them later and see the atrocities some of our ancestors committed (even here in the west), it is clear that were those things known by the generations directly affected at the time, then nearly every generation would have eventually succumbed to a bloody civil war.
We can be glad that things are getting declassified more quickly and citizens are now taking research and information gathering into their own hands.  But a lot of the fixing has to be with ourselves and the footprint we leave on the world that fuels all this exploitation.
In the meantime, we can but try to keep the peace and figure out how to undo past mistakes without fuelling an angry mob with pitchforks.
It is therefore up to the new generations of Chinese to figure out how to solve their problems; it is not for us to go in and forcefully install 'regime change', especially when there is so much positive work than can be done tidying up our own back yards, including the internet itself - a technology which, like bitcoin, does not care about artificial borders drawn by men and women centuries ago.

On the contrary, bitcoin gained millions and millions of users that signed up during that last rally.  Those curious newbies learned how to use exchanges, buy hardware wallets to secure their holdings and the like.  Those accounts and, most importantly, the new skills they learned haven't gone anywhere.  Then they went off to wax lyrical about bitcoin to their friends and family.  Amount of random snippets of crypto conversations I've overheard in cafes this last year is quite something.  Back in 2012 mentioning bitcoin just attracted blank stares "What's a Bit Com?".
Companies and individuals in this space cycled their gains back into infrastructure development and projects like the Pineapple Fund, for example, gave away some £50m in bitcoin to charities which was also cycled back into fiat.  I mean, we now have a [bitcoin roundabout]( near the bitstamp headquarters.  Which is just a beautiful example of the kinds of real world infrastructure (and good jobs) being created and funded by the ATH gains.  
Meanwhile, devs from MIT to UCL and beyond hunkered down to work on things like lightning which is currently experiencing an ATH in terms of bitcoins committed to the network ($2m at last check).  In addition, bitcoin / blockchain job openings and university degree students specialising in this area are seeing exponential growth.  CS graduates are most likely to enter the highest paying job roles after graduating, meaning they form a rock solid foundation on the retail investor level as they are able to risk more disposable income on this nascent computer science project than others. 
Market fluctuation wise, it's all rather reminiscent of the booms and busts we saw on Amazon stock during the dotcom rush.  Even though speculators were constantly panicking about the future of the internet; away from the noise Amazon were quietly seeing an exponential increase in users signing up to the service which told them that, ultimately, the crowd had already decided their future was to be bright.  
The subreddit here is now close to 1 million subscribers which is more than double (IIRC) to this time last year.
[Diffusion of Innovations]( is what this is all about.  We're still at the early innovator stage where back in 2007 you are the oddball in the room for using a smartphone.  But, as iPhone sales that year attested, it would only be 3-5 years before you would be just another dude with a smartphone.  Exchange / reddit signups are the equivalent to analysing those early iPhone sales that gave us a glimpse into future trends.  
Conflate all this then, and it's likely the next run-up will be quite something when those dormant exchange accounts become active again and are bolstered by the next wave of early adopters.  Exchanges themselves (Gemini, Gdax, Bitstamp) have also hardened and upgraded their infrastructure to cope with whatever demand might be thrown at them (which created a bottleneck at the last ATH due to being unable to cope with unprecedented demand).  Similarly Segwit adoption is going really well which means we will be in a much better state on the protocol level to handle far bigger rallies.  
TL;DR: *Real* serious technology investors analyse long term trends.  They understand there's going to be growing pains with new and disruptive tech; they're not looking for a quick return in one or two years.  They're looking where Amazon will be 10 years into the future and what that means for their kid's college fund.  Remember that guy that was laughed at back in the 90's for saying amazon stocks at $100 looked like a good buy?  He is the one that ended up laughing longest.
Personally, downturns like this are my favourite part.  The lambo and price posts stop and those that joined through FOMO calm down and begin to learn about the longer term tech vision, find conferences and new friends in the space and start thinking up new and amazing things they're gonna' be able to do on Web 3.0.  They simultaneously become hardened to price fluctuations as that long term vision crystallises and thus stengthen the next baseline of holders.

This was all tackled about 5 years ago but glad to see the discussion being opened to a more mainstream audience.
Before everyone gets in a knee-jerk panic about all this: the same applies to practically *any* site an unsuspecting individual may visit that contains links to circumspect stuff.  This is not grounds for blocking the entire internet or arresting internet surfers for having landed upon one of those sites.  
There are plenty of solutions in place for figuring out those who are actually engaging with and propagating that stuff through the darkweb and other places where 99.9999% of this is going to be happening... 
Are we going to argue that books and public libraries that contain potentially subversive stuff should also be banned?  What about 4Chan / Bittorrent / Youtube / Google?
Or has humanity actually learnt its lessons from the many other times in history we thought it a good idea to burn a whole bunch of information?
There are pros and cons to every new technology.  
The case for having an immutable global public ledger in time that the whole of humanity can write to without an invading army coming in and deleting / rewriting history, far outweighs the lame and stupid stuff people are going to inevitably do with that technology as it matures.

Indeed it does, which is why there are so many checks and balances in place to ensure that, over a long enough timeline, eventually the system corrects itself.
In the past, we refer to such resets as Jubilees, as we well recognise that since time immemorial, eventually power and greed reaches a point where the system will choke everyone...
It might just be that the internet and bitcoin's consensus driven governance model means, for the first time in history, we've figured out a way of building a network based on mathematics that can never, ever suffer the same fate as those systems that came before.

There are always random variables no-one can account for.  Such as Wikileaks payment channels being turned off and them announcing bitcoin as a Last Resort.  Satoshi expected this to blow the project out the water too soon (but his/her/their words were not gospel and Satoshi's wishes did not gain widespread consensus).
It's arguable had that not happened, Bitcoin could have quietly developed for another year as more optimal solutions were worked out before big business swooped in without clarity on the emerging landscape...
It is what it is and everything is as it should be... the network is built in such a way that the ecosystem will find the optimal way to thrive from the chaos.

Bitcoin doesn't care about the wall, nor the borders that lead to it.  If you feel so strongly about it, why not go set up a bitcoin fund for them and help empower ordinary citizens out there?  Or better still, why not fly out there and meet ordinary Israelis *and* Palestinians and go learn how complex the problems are?
If you're not prepared to do that perhaps look in your own local community that you *do* understand and get your own house in order before throwing rocks at a place you've never visited and a culture you only understand through a skewed media lense that dumbs both 'sides' down.

Lol.  Well, if our concept of aliens is "a 'race' of beings intellectually and technologically superior to ordinary humans" then we don't need to look much further than our own kind.  
If you were one of our great polymath Pirate ancestors who first set sail across the oceans and quickly realised the Earth was round, discovered new cultures, trade routes, astronomy, unimagined tools and technologies, medicines, animal and plant species... whilst learning a plethora of foreign languages imbued with ancient knowledge along the way... then you're going to look as 'alien' upon your return to the largely illiterate 'flat earth' masses of old as Vitalik and others do to the highly technologically illiterate masses of today.  
Epigenetics tells us that neurological changes and exposure to new environments will lead to transformation in gene expression, and over a long enough timeline we can suppose this will lead to evolutionary changes in DNA (which is how we envisage homo sapiens came to be in the first place).  Will brains over brawn prevail in the gene pool over the next century?  What would such a species look like when most of the manual labour is outsourced to machines?
As Newton observed "if we can see far, it is through standing on the shoulders of those giants that came before".  Each new generation simply builds on that knowledge and eventually eclipses the intelligence, tools and technologies of those giants that came before... whilst oftentimes lacking the emotional intelligence and humility that comes through worldly wisdom and life experience.  
If actual extra terrestrials *do* exist (as Keppler keeps finding planets in our galaxy in the Goldilocks zone, probability dictates ET's must surely be commonplace in this big ol' universe of ours) then it's likely they look upon this current human epoch with the same detached intrigue as we do an ant colony.

There are two ways of doing this: blame and shame (and get both 'sides' riled up into a state of fight or flight) or: rise above it and simply share superior and more ethical solutions pointing out advantages to end users, without forcing the message.
IMO, keeping people focused on the positives via the latter approach will slow everyone down a lot less, and maybe even inspire the bitpay team into coming over to the light side as opposed to getting caught up in petty "he said, she said" Twitter / Reddit debates.

Events like Gay Pride Day have been incredibly important in helping to spread awareness of issues that mainstream society rarely even thought about... Let's not forget that it was barely a generation ago that saw Alan Turing - the father of modern computing - facing chemical castration for being homosexual.
Celebrating and discussing the great many challenges women have gone through to get even the most basic of rights recognised (such as the right to own property which they've only had in recent history) is an important part of our collective dialogue and societal growth.
Like it or not, in the west I.T. is still heavily dominated by men, there is still a huge gender pay gap in almost all sectors and, in many places around the globe women don't even have the most basic rights we all in the west take for granted.
If everything is alright in our own back garden then thats wonderful, but recognise this may not be the case for everyone and people affected by these issues have an absolute right to get together, discuss them and celebrate the similarities which they all share.

TOR was created by the US naval research laboratory and, last I checked, is funded by the US and Swedish governments.


The HSBC money laundering fiasco shows us just how easy it actually is...  Coupled with Swiss bank accounts and the hoards of shell companies operating around the world in the shadows.   Just as we have a two tier justice system based on money and status, it is clear to anyone paying attention that privacy and anonymity exists in the fiat world, but not on an egalitarian basis that extends to the ordinary citizen (and arguably, those citizens with the least to hide).
Furthermore, once cash enters the shadow economy, traceability is virtually zero.  Counterfeiting is also a huge problem.
This is in stark contrast to bitcoin (which can't be counterfeited) and the bitcoin public ledger, which provides all kinds of tools for retroactive analysis.
We only need to look at the silk road case to see how intelligence agencies have ample toolsets for 'following the money' via blockchain analysis.
The difference here is that these are tools that the ordinary public can ultimately access (as opposed to a small group of unelected 'leaders').
Back to cash: 
Here's a link to a discussion around a report from the Bank of England outlining how half of all UK bank notes in circulation are in the shadow economy, used to fund activities such as drug use and prostitution.
Which amounts to around 10% of UK GDP.
Oil is also used as a bartering chip of course.  ISIL is largely funded through illicit oil sales and cash.
On North Korea: it's estimated that around 10-15% of US bank notes are printed in NK and are of better quality than those coming from the US.
See: 
Reality check:
It is understandable that people new to all this may find a global, transparent public ledger such as bitcoin a little unnerving and, whilst there is no doubt the computer scientists behind this technology still have a lot of work (and convincing) to do, it is clear that, if harnessed in the right way, this technology will ultimately lead to a free, more equitable world for us all.
Indeed, we can imagine a future where every penny our governments spend will be open to public scrutiny.  
The UK government's chief science advisor terms this kind of transparency 'glass governance'.
Instead of shouting about a new world they barely understand, those good custodians of the old paperbelt world that still work in the light, ought to get their own back gardens in order so that we can ease the transition, leaving regulation of this bold new crypto space to the global crowd of internet denizens that gave birth to it.
In good time, we *will* have web of trust style networks spanning the globe that give rise to everything from global crowdfunding networks to worldwide intelligence networks decoupled from nation states, party politics and ideological world views. But, as with the internet and all grand restructuring projects of this kind, it will take time to get there.
But it is only through a consensus driven approach where the entire of humanity get a say over the future of this technology, where decisions are carried out based on rational, critical analysis from well informed crowds... that we will all get there. 
That's a lot of responsibility for individuals to take on; it requires thinking for ourselves and walking away from those emperors with no clothes who have, time and time again, proven they can't be trusted to make rational decisions inline with objective reality and certainly can't be trusted with the custodianship of our data.
Those old systems based around partisanship and tribalism got us this far... but as we collectively look to the stars and imagine new possibilities for exploration and discovery, they can get us no further... since those kinds of bold endeavours require the entire of humanity to get behind.

The sub is close to a million subscribers.  Posts regularly make it into r/all.  This, in tandem with the mass adoption we're seeing from ordinary members of the public, is going to naturally attract people from other subs who are just discovering this community for the first time.
Often the first reaction of many of these people will be the feeling that they are missing out, especially when the sub is in high spirits... cognitive dissonance sets in, which will lead them to look for arguments that prop up their current understanding of how the world works (which this sub is very much challenging remember).  This creates a state of fight or flight and that's when the FUD starts.    
When the sub is in less high spirits, it's a case of schadenfreude; you will see "ha! ha! I told you so!" types coming in here getting a kick from seeing others when they're down, whilst reaffirming their current conditioning as to how the world works.
Believe it or not, the sub has dealt with the exact same waves of FUD from practically day one.  If it wasn't r/buttcoiners, it was 'experts' in finance and economics doing the same thing in the early days.  
Most of those 'experts' have since come around to all this, now it's the average Joe we are dealing with.  Which is good, since ordinary citizens adopting this are the ones that will be most crucial to bitcoins long-term success in enabling us to create a more fair and equitable financial system for everyone.
In the end, the best way to combat FUD is to remain calm and do what we've always done in this space: simply tell the truth... That, and a solid commitment to staying humble (through the high times and the low) is what helps us move forward as one unified movement that truly believe in one another.  
It also means strictly checking sources, and vetting both bad news (and good!) for biases and inaccuracies, lest we ourselves inadvertently take part in the disinformation campaign.
As with all information we let shape our views... Ultimately, it's up to newcomers to the technology to start thinking for themselves and filtering out the noise...  We no longer have to shout bitcoin from the rooftops or spend our days writing essays – the truth is out there and discoverable by anyone with a keen curiosity and even the most basic of critical thinking skills.

Beautifully put, agree with nearly everything you've said.  
Only thing I take exception with: would I advise my mother to get involved in bitcoin at the moment when I see how her Windows machine is already riddled with spam and crooked companies (in the old world) trying to get old people to part with their money? Would I advise anyone to consider selling their house in bitcoin? Am I happy that the majority of the posts in here lately seem to be price related memes posted by people who think bitcoin is a get rich scheme? 
I don't believe everyone should be wrapped in cotton wool but I'm glad that things like the financial ombudsman and citizens advice bureau exists to help protect people in this world who have fallen victim to con artists.  At the moment Bitcoin is *just about* safe enough for tech savvy youngsters bought up in the big wild internet West to put their pocket money in alongside wise old neckbeards who know what they're doing.  It's not safe for the 3-4 billion people yet to even use the internet.  And it's not safe for grandmas to throw their life savings into. 
Bitcoin and especially the ethereum erc20 space has a lot of con artists, a lot of people wrongly selling crypto as a speculative asset.  
As such, many of the good, responsible internet companies who have been here a long time are rightly waiting to see how lightning and rootstock develop so we can introduce rock solid accountability into the ICO space.  Which is why you've heard nothing from the likes of Google, AirBnB and the myriad Y-Combinator stealth projects happening right now.  Patience is the key.  
TL;DR: Instead of a speculative asset, I'll be glad when bitcoin is seen instead as the way we measure the flow of resources, human energy and global trust.  
We're a long way off yet, but I share your optimism and enthusiasm for the future :)

Humans do also tend to look for patterns that aren't really there.  We like to think there's some overarching group in control of all things (Illuminati, Aliens) sat at the top pulling reality in the direction they choose since we don't like the idea that no-one is really in control of anything.  
Could we explain the tiger attack?  Simpsons is a popular show, no doubt Siegfried and Roy watched the episode.  Since performing with dangerous animals is largely about confidence and projecting a lack of fear, did the episode plant a seed of doubt in the mind of Roy enough for the Tiger to pick up on this?  
With regards to 9/11.  A great deal many people in the world must have known an 'event' had been planned in NY on that day.  Even if they had no details of exactly what it would be.  
It would then only take a few people in the know to start saying "stay away from the twin towers on 9/11" for that meme to start spreading in certain circles...  Half whispered conversations subconsciously picked up in cafes, bars, and so forth that then becomes nothing more than what we ascribe to being a 'gut feeling'.  
This is likely the real reason WTC insurance policies were updated as opposed to there being a grand conspiracy.  Such behind the scenes activities would only add more fuel to the rumour mill, moving the probability of something *actually* happening even higher, since everything is based on inter-subjective belief, and when we're fearful we begin making mistakes which emboldens those we are fearful of (like Roy's tiger :p), thus increasing their likelihood of success.
This works the other way too.  If enough people believe we can achieve world peace by 2020 then that's exactly what will happen.  Just as peace in Ireland, civil rights, the fall of the Berlin wall and myriad other peaceful victories were achieved when the pendulum of probabilities were swayed by the weight of the crowd united in a common belief.  Energy flows where attention goes.
Along that route, these 'gut feelings' plucked out of the noise are expressed through art like the Simpsons even though the artists creating it can't pinpoint exactly where they got their inspiration and 'visions' from.  
Some will explain the seemingly impossible away by saying "I channeled God".  Perhaps though, they are just better at tuning out the noise, reading environments and picking up on 'feelings' that most of us are too busy to truly hear.

I'd be very surprised if many haven't done this already.  However, making that public would create yet another bubble and catch politicians and governments new to this disruption unawares before internal structural and educational reforms have been put in place.  Getting the timing right on announcements when you're planning 10/20/30 years ahead is *as* important as the announcements themselves.
Not to mention the bitcoin network itself which is nowhere near ready to handle the increased load that will come with mass adoption.
One only has to look through the minutes of government meetings from the 90s to see how they handled the disruptive nature of the internet and email to gain some 20/20 insight into what's going on.  
And it's unlikely that whichever bank did this first would suddenly become the richest on the planet as some have suggested here, or that fiat is suddenly going to disappear.  We live in a global world increasingly moving away from zero sum tactics and unchecked hierarchy, and that requires careful balancing of wealth and resources as we get better at monitoring and issuing more equitable capital flows on a planetary scale.

All of those things you've just asked me for are things a select few anointed emperors already demand from you.  Except it's not a two-way thing, nor do we have any clue how your data is being used (and sold) by those emperors or (as in the recent Equifax breach) whether it's even secure.
Don't get privacy, anonymity, and the pseudo anonymity already afforded by the public ledger... mixed up.
Nor should you think the technology stands still.  Expect layer 2/3 tech and initiatives like blockstack to allow for separate encrypted layers of data protection and decentralised storage not subject to data breaches... such that you do not have to give your data to anyone you don't trust. 
With such a system in place, we can expect full transparency from institutions, charities and corporations when it comes to public accountability.

That's where lightning and sidechains come in and alts like monero that can integrate via atomic swaps.
Bitcoin providing a universal settlement layer via a pseudonymous transparent, immutable global public ledger ensures it cannot be used for the kinds of shady criminality we've seen committed by those at the very top of the ladder (think HSBC money laundering fiasco and the sub prime mortgage loans that lead to bitcoin's invention).
The beauty in all this, is that it's just code.  If there's consensus that agrees this level of transparency is negatively impacting good actors in the space, that code can and will change.

Bitcoin hasn't been banned, exchanges are being closed down due to poor regulatory oversight and lack of money transmitter licences (or whatever the Chinese equivalent would be).  
If Simon Dixon's latest communications hold water (he's out there at the moment), then one of the problems they face in China is they *literally* have Grannies out there buying into fraudulent ICO's (at least 5 last week launched that were outright fraud according to Simon) and dodgy exchanges that could go belly up any day, ripping ordinary people off in the process.  How is what China are doing any different to the pre-emptive KYC measures requiring Coinbase to purchase 'money transmitter' licences in every U.S. state in order to operate?  In fact shouldn't China be applauded for giving exchanges a fair go in the wild (requiring practically no oversight) given the cumbersome restrictions imposed on anyone wanting to operate out of the U.S?
If anything, their actions can be blamed on many companies within the bitcoin and ethereum space for not trying to ensure a greater duty of care within the ecosystem, meaning poor old mama and papa are clicking on "nigerian prince type scams" (replace nigerian prince with "ICO fools gold") in email inboxes that were long ago infected with malware.  Even experienced tech savvy bitcoiners have fallen for phishing sites and scams in the last few years....
Just look at the mess of ICO advertising and speculative ad material on  for one example of how the bitcoin (and especially the ethereum community) is failing to regulate itself from scammers.  
Seems we have all these great ideas for changing the world, decentralising this and that in the future, but fail to see right now we're just creating a shinier version of the speculative nonsense and greed that lead to the need for the creation of bitcoin in the first place.
Will the exchanges come back with proof of reserves and proper oversight?  Are we going to see decentralised exchanges anyway?  Will Chinese citizens moving their bitcoins into cold storage ultimately be good for both China and the bitcoin economy as the eco system gets over the latest dotcom ICO frenzy and we put checks and balances in place to protect people from scammers?
Time will tell.  
In the meantime, nothing has changed in terms of the core bitcoin technology or where Layer 2 tech is set to take us in the next quarter (tech that will help us address many of the above problems).
TL;DR: We ought look in our own back garden and start getting things in order if we want to prove to the old world that all this shiny new stuff can work without requiring intervention.

There's no need to fight to prevent anything.  The ecosystem will eventually find the optimal solutions and in the meantime, there's more than enough room for all kinds of experiments.  Let people (incumbents or not) play with the technology on an equal footing and see what comes of it.
Bitcoin maximalism was needed at the beginning because we were so small a group and being attacked from a million different angles.  Nowadays, we can all sit back knowing that part of the 'battle' is over, safe in the knowledge that if we all play fairly bitcoin is going to thrive, but so are myriad other currencies (Andreas Antonopoulos is right, I think, to envisage a day when there are tens of thousands of cryptos each with unique value propositions).
Ultimately *anything* can be used for trading, from GovCoins that have all kinds of state insurances baked into them, to mobile phone credits in africa and even cigarettes in prison.

Not exactly.  If we read / watch old works of Sci-Fi (Star Trek movies / Isaac Asimov novels for instance) many of the fantastical things imagined heavily inspired and informed scientists and engineers creating things in actual reality.  Science *fiction* then just becomes science.
The internet, for example, was imagined by Isaac in 1956 in 'The Last Question'.  His works were read widely by those involved in computer science.  Similarly, Neal Stephenson predicted bitcoin back in 2002 in his novel Cryptonomicon, another geek favourite.
As new ideas gain awareness with a small subset of the crowd they are weaved into creative works (like the Simpsons, South Park, Black Mirror and more generally through billboards, music, literary works and the visual arts) and projected onto the masses, often influencing our inter-subjective realities in profound ways through the subconscious.  
Since the future 'reality' is nothing but a series of constantly shifting probabilities, the end state will be those ideas that gain the most traction (memetic effect) with the crowd en masse via a series of these subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) nudges.

I have never seen such a diverse group of people - all with different cultural backgrounds and ideas about what makes the world spin - so united in a common cause.

Sure, but then so does America and many other nations. 
It's just we put a shinier gloss over all the injustices going on in our own back yards by trotting out buzzwords like 'freedom' and 'democracy' whilst busying ourselves with 'reality' TV and cheap entertainment.
We come to r/bitcoin and lambast MSM for the FUD we see being written about bitcoin... we know the journalists are writing absolute nonsense, then turn the page over and churn out the same fear based, FUD drivel written about a foreign country we've never visited... like it's somehow more factual than the crap on the preceding page we just read about bitcoin.
If we want to fix things, start with the culture you understand and know best (i.e. the one on your doorstep) and leave it to bitcoiners in China to fix theirs.

Bitcoin, like currency itself, is just a technology.  Luckily it doesn't evolve in a technological vacuum and nor do societal constructs.  
It's really up to all of us to decide what to do with these new possibilities.  Just as it has been with the internet and, before that, the technology we call computers.

Right now, a whole lot of the amazing projects funded on bitcoin gains in Q4 (e.g. pineapple fund charities) will be ploughing that accrued capital into actual real world things, be that staff hires, office spaces, research and education, clean water procurement (in the case of some African projects).  
Amazing art projects like the [bitcoin roundabout]( in Slovenia requires cycling BTC back into fiat in order to pay the contractors, architects, builders, artists...  This is what we have to do to get things done in this imperfect world.  
Not to mention all the programmers, designers and engineers behind all this that still need to eat ramen :p
At the end of the day, it doesn't matter at this juncture whether we're using bitcoin, euros, tally sticks or sea shells to breathe oxygen into all these endeavours, as long as we're doing a better job funding the right people for the right reasons than an old world that's struggling to breathe due to a whole bunch of red tape stymying progress...
I know [we're all eager to see that more perfect world]( right this instant... and there *will* come a time when mass adoption leads to there being no need for fiat on/off ramps (and when that happens BTC will stabilise) but that requires **scale** which will come from lightning and sidechains.  And, like all grand human engineering endeavours that changed the planet before... It also takes time and patience to build that new world.
If you got in on the get rich quick bandwagon, zoom out and relax.  You're very lucky to have gotten in so soon... So well done on getting such a great window seat in the lunar shuttle :)

All it takes is patience and calm, rational dialogue.  There are plenty videos and courses out there now to aid with the education process.
I'd advise not trying to push bitcoin down peoples' throats.  If you've been down the rabbit hole remember how long that education process took you.  Also remember people are busy *working* and simply *surviving*, not everyone can afford the time it takes to do the research.
We'll all get there in the end, just as we did with email, Internet and before that credit and debit cards.
We'd all do well to remember the old proverb "When one is in a hurry, one often ends up completing a task more slowly."

To be fair, there's always been a no alt coin discussion policy.  
Given the metric ton of alt coin spam being levied at r/bitcoin, coupled with the meteoric growth in subscribers... mods need all the help they can picking it up.
If there's any doubt that bch is an alt, let us remember even Jihan (one of its chief proponents) asked via a tweet that bch stop trying to be bitcoin, cementing its alt coin status.  
Which is fine... there's room for bch (as an alt) as soon as supporters learn their best way of finding their niche is through atomic swaps, and embracing the will of the economic (and scientific!) majority who, along with Jihan, well and truly settled this 'debate' many moons ago.

Just some nerds working in the graphics department suggesting it to the writers no doubt.
I personally snuck a whole bunch of bitcoin 'propaganda' into the backdrop of a movie set before even this Simpsons episode aired.  Basically, one of the producers needed us to help out with printing the wall hangings for the set; he was an ex web developer and so we got talking about bitcoin at length during the 10 hour print run.  5 hours into the job he was using bitcoin and suggested I amend a whole bunch of the Photoshop files yet to be printed so that bitcoin was visible in the background.  I even managed to get the genesis block Times newspaper headline in the final shot.
There's no conspiracy... Many nerds who made their riches on the internet went on to have fun working in music and film and have since fallen in love with bitcoin.

It's possible this latest push is not directed at lawmakers and government, but private banks and financial institutions that would seek to thwart progress through disinformation campaigns.
The target has always been to maintain a careful balance in all this where no one group is able to exert undue influence over a technology that they are yet to fully understand.
In the end it comes down to ensuring there are enough backup plans and good technologists thinking 10 steps ahead so that noone unintentionally screws up.  Andreas is one such adversarial thinker laying out potential scenarios ahead of time that may need confronting.
We must not forget those good people working in the light in governments and financial institutions around the world have had their hands tied by some pretty nefarious groups as much as anyone else... Those paying most attention can see how bitcoin may just be *the* solution we've all been waiting for.
Andreas' comments merely show everyone how things *could* go should the old world push too hard... just as Core's proof of work change 'Plan B' showed miners during last year's B2X attack how things *could* go if they too tried to push the economic majority into places they weren't prepared to go.

We need to think very carefully about what it is we want bitcoin to become and remember that nearly all the problems with the current system stem from the fact corporations and the people within them (and by extension governments and less scrupulous politicians) have been able to hide what they are doing from public scrutiny.  As a result we have a two tier justice system in operation and those working in the light to uphold the good moral foundation of that system have, at times, found themselves outflanked and outnumbered.
Thanks to shadow banking and shell companies being able to shield their actions from public scrutiny and government oversight via an array of complex financial instruments, the ordinary citizen has had no idea where their economic energy is actually going.  This has meant the 'good' people following the Golden Rule have had to cheat just to survive...  Do not ever forget that politicians are just *people*, many of whom went into that game to make the world a better place, only to find themselves in the pockets of ideologically driven lobbyists and special interests groups that see this entire world as nothing but a paper money playground.  
We are now seeing bitcoin creeping into politics; with ideologically driven groups and individuals who wish to impose their world views over others accepting bitcoin via third party payment processors.  Ultimately, this means the public making those donations have no real oversight into where that money is being spent.  Sound familiar?
Contrast that with say the way [RNLI]( or [Pineapple Fund]( handle their donations and we begin to see a world where companies, individuals and charitable organisations are empowered through transparency; a world where everyone is incentivised to play a *whole*sum game as opposed to a zerosum game based on greed and competition.  
This is *real* bottom-up transparency: what goes for the individual also applies to those people and organisations at the very top of the system (which, after all, are just *groups of individuals*).  We might then call this 'trickle-up' transparency.  It then becomes incumbent on every government, local council and public institution to 'play by the rules'.  Gone then, are lobbyists able to buy votes or local council governors able to grease the wheels of the 'old boys network' and hand public funded projects to 'mates'.  Gone too, are the days of playing casino games (such as sub prime mortgage hot potato) with other people's economic energy.
For bitcoin to remain politically neutral then, it's crucial the entire crowd get to vet transactions going through the ledger should they so choose.  And of course all this goes for corporations as much as it does for the governments and councils employing them.  And when those 'leaders' the masses look up to start playing by the rules, then everyone below is incentivised to follow by way of example.
Truth is, we all want to know that when we're moving our economic energy around (be that through our retail purchases or the money we give to government) that it is being used for *good*.  Most would not choose to spend their money on things that are costing lives or devastating the environment.  But with the way things currently are, there's no way of being 100% sure where we choose to spend our economic energy hasn't just gone towards poisoning a river in Africa or caused another impoverished worker to leap off a factory roof.  
Personally, I would like to know the supply chain of every purchase I'm making and every business I'm vicariously supporting through those purchases; I want to know if the parts in my mobile phone have been involved in conflict minerals;  I want to know if the cafe I eat at is paying everyone equally; I want to know if the bitcoin bank I use in the future is supporting companies involved in the production of things like Land Mines, and I want to know if the politicians we elected to represent us are wasting money on things like private jets, bottles of Moet and first class train travel at the publics expense.  And, crucially, I want to be able to opt out of those things - even if it means paying a little more to do so - by voting with my pocket book.
Most of us would agree: if given the option - we would all choose to consume ethically.  The issue to date hasn't been a lack of good people in the world; it's been a lack of good information that empowers the individual to opt out of anything they believe to be evil. 
In order for that world to unfold, I believe we need to maintain a globally transparent public ledger and trust that the "51% defence" (i.e. that there will always be more good, moral people following the Golden Rule involved in bitcoin than bad people exploiting the system) remains in place.  Bitcoin is just as much about the integrity of the people onboarding and championing the *movement* itself as it is empowerment of those people through the awesome technology advancements it brings about.
In the meantime, as we begin to start the transition to that beautiful vision.... things like Monero and Zcash are already shielding people's economic energy from immoral and unjust laws and governments.  Just as TOR does the same for IP traffic.  
As all this unfurls across a borderless cyberspace, we can begin to see how Trust Networks will naturally emerge from all this, married up to Layer 2/3 tech like Blockstack.  
In that world, where trust networks are decoupled from borders and hierarchical institutions, we may choose to look into those networks spending histories and see that, for example, 20% of purchases made by X were carried out on the dark web or that 100% of their commitments to pay back a loan were made...  It would be then up to us - as individuals - to exercise our own personal judgement as to whether we wish to do business with those networks, instead of leaving those decisions to a group of unelected representatives to do this on our behalf, largely in the dark (which is how the current system operates).
In the end it all comes down to whether we are each prepared to start taking individual responsibility and thinking more deeply about where we spend our economic energy and *what* we spend that energy *on* and, crucially, the supply chains our purchases prop up, and the impact they have on the wider world.

*"We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology."* — Carl Sagan
Whilst the 1000-3000+ people joining this reddit on a daily basis may not see this, we are long passed the fighting stage.  
The crux of the issue is with people listening to false idols like Jamie (who know nothing about science and technology) erroneously thinking they have some kind of power or handle on the future of humanity.  This worship of false idols is a habit we all need to break, and I include here those 'bitcoin experts' on twitter that get flood linked in this reddit whenever there is some kind of large scale debate on an issue.  
To understand bitcoin right now is to be part of a small group who understood the internet in its early stages, a group that would have been honest enough to tell everyone "We do not know where all this will lead; the only thing for certain is that it is going to completely change the fabric of society in myriad positive ways and in doing so, throw up a plethora of unforeseen challenges."
Of course old world specialists of that early internet era such as Paul Krugman, told everyone the world wide web would be no more transformative than the fax machine.  Jamie's comments on bitcoin are no different to Paul's internet comments...  and will, in years to come, be just as laughable.
*"An invention has to make sense in the world in which it is finished, not the world in which it is started.”* — Ray Kurzweil
It has taken *actual* computer scientists and technology geeks years to truly grasp bitcoin - the idea.  So what chance does a paper belt merchant who has only given this tech the most cursory of glances (and is not cognitively equipped to understand the underlying technology) have?  
Certainly, Jamie's comments tell us he has not thought deeply about how bitcoin will intersect everything from the machine-payable web to how we sell our house in the future, which means his thinking is constrained to how bitcoin works in *his world* instead of the world of tomorrow that bitcoiners and internet denizens are enthusiastically rebuilding anew.
Those in government and universities across the world that have taken a step back and truly analysed this in depth have realised that with patience and the right kind of nurturing, bitcoin is set to transform the world of money in much the same way that the internet transformed the world of information and communication.
See: [The UK's Chief Scientist Recommends Bitcoin Blockchain](
Given the UK were the first nation to push an SMS text message back in 1993, and were the first to embrace and understand the transformative capacity of the world wide web (Tim Berners-Lee was a Brit), I would hazard a guess the professors, politicians, banking execs and scientists that contributed to that (and myriad other) government reports, have a greater handle on all this than the likes of Jamie Dimon.
Indeed, there was a [fascinating debate in the UK parliament back in 2014]( that highlighted the need for something like Bitcoin (the debate was instigated by Steve Baker *because* of the invention of bitcoin).
*"Thankfully the institution of money is a human and social institution.  It has been changed and I believe it can be changed again."* – Steve Baker, MP
Since then we have seen ex UK [PM David Cameron travel to some 16 countries with the CEO of blockchain.info]( discussing this brave new world, as well as [opening the blockchain.info offices]( in London.
It is important to remember that bitcoin isn't dependent on people like David Cameron any more than it is dependent on Jamie Dimon *or* the views of the UK government, America, China or old world financial incumbents like JP Morgan.
**It is dependent on people like you** to begin thinking for yourself and believing in a better world.

Either way, it doesn't help to pin labels on people. We're all who we are as a result of a random cosmic dice throw, and the nurture and education we received in the unique environments we just happened to be born into.
Consider: when a driver lets someone in at a busy traffic junction, do they think about the culture the person they're letting in are a part of?  Their career choices, music tastes, sexual orientation, political viewpoints, religion, sports team they follow...  Or do we let them in because it makes us feel good to help someone else, and because we hope the person would do the same for us if roles were reversed?
There is but one moral rule we all need follow and it's common to all cultures and religions: "treat others as you wish to be treated yourself".

As has been pointed out on here many times: **Blockstream does not control core** and cannot brute force consensus.
Just take a look at the dev mailing list to see with your own eyes how every single proposal and idea has reams of essays and discussion from the TWO HUNDRED or so PEOPLE who have been contributing to core over the years.  And how EVERYTHING happens with complete transparency (unlike the coding that goes on in the 2X implementation).
Now, since you bought the subject up of money and VC interests unduly influencing bitcoin development...
I wonder if you could explain this one for me?  You may have noticed it at the bottom of every coindesk article relating to NYA agreements the following disclaimer.
**Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Abra, BitGo, BitPay, Blockstream, Bloq, Circle, RSK Labs, ShapeShift and Xapo.**
How much VC money is on the table there between them I wonder?  And does it bother you at all that the biggest news outlet for bitcoin seemingly have a vested monetary interest in seeing 2X go ahead, given DCG were the ones who made NYA happen?
Does it bother you at all that if 2X went ahead and brute forced the network from Core that DCG and Jeff would essentially have undue influence over the protocol, and access to a news resource able to influence the price and industry at the push of a submit button?  Does it bother you that Jeff and DCG companies would stand to profit massively from that, especially if they can control a protocol that no longer requires adhering to the sound consensus based governance processes that core have been operating perfectly under for the last 8 years?

We were lied to about Saddam having weapons of mass destruction (indeed in a [recent TV interview]( former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown revealed his understanding the pentagon absolutely knew this to be a lie).  
More recently we were lied to about the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and now we are expected to believe elections were rigged in Venezuela without us (yet again) being provided with a single shred of hard evidence.  
America itself hardly has a clean sheet on this matter: there's a strong case that the George Bush presidency was illegitimate afterall (the hanging Chads fiasco is still fresh in everyone's mind).  
How would have Americans felt if the rest of the world had come together and named Gore the president based on the American left there saying the Bush vote was fixed?  It was a messy election that Americans themselves needed to come to terms with and was frankly noone elses business, which is why the world stayed out of their affairs.
As with this one.  Citizens need to begin demanding absolutely incontrovertible **proof** before allowing unelected representatives to make foreign policy decisions like this which will of course have major geopolitical and domestic ramifications; the unforeseen consequences of which risk destabilising affairs in much the same way Rumsfeld’s “unknown unknowns” did.
None of us have forgotten the sexed up dossier that lead to the death of Dr. David Kelly, or Colin Powell's dodgy intelligence slides, nor indeed [Eisenhower's parting words]( as President warning against the military industrial complex that has lead directly to the egregious foreign policies we are today still feeling the shockwaves from.
If the U.S. administration truly wants to stop being the "police of the world" and move towards non interventionist foreign policies (as Trump and co. assert) then perhaps they should start walking the walk and scale back their interest and loud pronouncements on the internal affairs of other sovereign nations.  
Unless, of course, this is all part of the plan in this 4D chess game, what with the closure of the Venezuelan U.S Embassy and the administration now recommending Americans staying there head back home, which will of course culminate in the diminution in U.S ex pat influence on the ground there. 
Let's hope the Venezuelan citizenry themselves make use of the ample tools they now have (online and offline) to open meaningful dialogue with each other so they can fix their own problems without requiring the same kind of knee-jerk intervention from the West that has time and time again backfired and only ends up costing everyone dearly in the long-term, including the West.

*Post-truth politics (also called post-factual politics) is a political culture in which debate is framed largely by appeals to emotion disconnected from the details of policy, and by the repeated assertion of talking points to which factual rebuttals are ignored.*
*Post-truth differs from traditional contesting and falsifying of truth by rendering it of "secondary" importance. While this has been described as a contemporary problem, there is a possibility that it has long been a part of political life, but was less notable before the advent of the Internet.

Bitcoin, like the internet, is for everyone.  It too has rules and working groups (W3C) and professionals from all walks of life ensuring its technical evolution is understood by the various industries / economies it intersects.  
None of that changes the permisionless nature of the protocols themselves any more than the various publishing and organisations of old changed the permisionless nature of pen, paper and the printing press.
Same too with the way Bitcoin improvement proposals, IRC / Dev mailing lists GitHub working groups and the Linux Dev mailing list underpin bitcoin's evolution, supported by the various university R&amp;D teams that contribute to that growing engineering talent pool.


As with the internet, this 'movement' is far too diverse for us to be able to outline what we 'want' since everyone involved has very different needs and unique ways of defining what constitutes our inter-subjective reality.  It is that diversity in thought and ideas that gives Bitcoin its true strength.
It is not for you or I to say how old world governance systems we know little of should be bending to accommodate this technology.   Ultimately, where Bitcoin is a decade from now will be down to how this incredible tool is used and adopted by ordinary citizens around the globe and the unique set of value systems their jurisdictions ascribe to choose to fold this into existing systems.  We are not the Borg quoting scripture from an echo chamber.
Hence, for example, bitcoin ATMs are outlawed in the very orderly country of Germany but welcomed openly in places like the UK; two very different systems and unique cultures who have developed their own methodologies for coping with the disruptive effects of new technology.
In the end, if there is one rule we can all agree on, it surely must be [the Golden Rule](

Well, back when bitcoin was a nice little crazy experiment and everyone just let it evolve behind closed doors, and no-one knew about the Silkroad apart from everyone in the tech world (and obviously the big intelligence apparatus watching it all).  Back then, before Wikileaks made their announcement and the whole thing exploded, the original idea was that everything from exchanges to marketplaces like openbazaar would run through the client with nice little web of trust layers in place so everyone could trust each other via escrow type services...  
But it didn't go that way because some people like to fight and rush things, and cause mayhem.  And because some people were just terrified Wikileaks and Julilan would be finished and we'd sleep walk into facism...  I'm not sure what 'side' of that debate I would have been on at the time, but I do know as a result of the exposure that's when business descended on bitcoin, and speculation and greed.
Billions of back-up plans have been invoked every day since, including Ethereum and the myriad alts spawned.


Nothing should be banned or limited; it's telling people what they can and can't do and pushing stuff like drugs (including alcohol in the 1920's prohibition era) underground that got us all in this mess.


There is no attack vector, there are already decentralised exchanges, if people can be bothered to use them.  Just as there are bitcoin debit cards that will fix westerner coffee cravings with no fees if people can be bothered to use them instead of trying to weigh in on a computer science scaling debate they have no technical understanding of.
The greatest attack vector is as it has always been, allow bitcoiners to rip themselves apart from the inside through fear, shake out the weak and greedy players, and rebuild, rebuild, rebuild as everything else evolves slowly and securely and the people who don't give one single nano shit about the price and speculation, continue to code and create new solutions that truly benefit humanity as a whole.
Lightning Network, Rootstock, Blockstack, for those that care to understand, fix almost everything, including instant fee-less coffee purchases, decentralised exchange and marketplaces and trusted global identity data layers forming a web of trust.
In the meantime, all that greed (ridiculous ICO's, scam exchanges and middlemen businesses that take commissions) will need to pivot or close up shop.
Remember, none of this is happening in a technology vacuum, as well as understanding bitcoin's evolution, we must see what effect VR, Global Crowdfunding, the 3-4 Billion unbanked getting access to the global economy through all this, Robotics, AI, Medical Apps, Permaculture and Green Energy revolution, the machine-payable-web is going to play in the future bitcoin is set to inhabit. 
And, most importantly, what happens when there is no need for suppliers, businesses, customers or their automated accountants and lawyers to change bitcoin at all?  What happens when central banks tether their national currencies to the bitcoin blockchain via Lightning Network and so on...
See... people in bitcoin world think it all stands still, they lack imagination and the forward thinking ideas that got us from 2008 to 2017... whereas the people building all this, and governments themselves are constantly thinking 10 years ahead and wiring into each unfolding reality a billion backup plans for how things might go...

I think we all need to exercise a little bit of patience and tone down the worry-ometer.  
Bitcoin is being embraced by governments as a good thing that will help them introduce transparency.
See: [The UK’s Chief Science Adviser Recommends Bitcoin’s Blockchain]( and the myriad positive things ex-prime minister David Cameron has said about the space.  We're also seeing bitcoin being legalised in places like Vietnam and innumerable physical bitcoin spaces opening up.  Online, this sub is growing at between 1000-3000 users a day and coinbase are seeing similar user growth.
The latest crackdown on ICO's is a *good thing* and absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin.  What we're seeing in the ICO world is basically the equivalent of the dotcom rush and 90% of them are vaporware nonsense just getting on the 'blockchain', 'decentralisation' hype bandwagon.  
The moment you have [celebs]( pushing ICO's you know things are getting silly :)
Having said that: yes, eventual decentralised exchanges (and indeed mining) will be a good thing, especially with regard to flatlining speculation and reducing the 'power' small groups with vested interests can command from mining profits.
At this juncture, we just need to breathe deeply, relax and wait for Layer 2 solutions so we can do *real* decentralisation in a calm, considered fashion without requiring dirty hacks and kludges.  
Meanwhile, if you can write well, design, code, think also what you might be able to offer the space in terms of ideas and outreach beyond commentary on events.
For those who play a more passive role, best thing we can all do now is just educate ourselves (and others in this sub) as to what LN / Blockstack / Rootstock means for bitcoin, and think about exploring opportunities in these new domains.

Just be wary of stopping to their levels lest ww become the monsters we oppose.  Keeping a constant check in our own back garden is also part of the staying vigilant process...
B2X feels like a decade ago, let companies and people move on from their mistakes, there's no need to see any of this as zero sum.

Well, back when bitcoin was a nice little crazy experiment and everyone just let it evolve behind closed doors, and no-one knew about the Silkroad apart from everyone in the tech world (and obviously the big intelligence apparatus watching it all).  Back then, before Wikileaks made their announcement and the whole thing exploded, the original idea was that everything from exchanges to marketplaces like openbazaar would run through the client with nice little web of trust layers in place so everyone could trust each other via escrow type services...  
But it didn't go that way because some people like to fight and rush things, and cause mayhem.  And because some people were just terrified Wikileaks and Julilan would be finished and we'd sleep walk into facism...  I'm not sure what 'side' of that debate I would have been on at the time, but I do know as a result of the exposure that's when business descended on bitcoin, and speculation and greed.
Billions of back-up plans have been invoked every day since, including Ethereum and the myriad alts spawned.


Nothing should be banned or limited; it's telling people what they can and can't do and pushing stuff like drugs (including alcohol in the 1920's prohibition era) underground that got us all in this mess.


There is no attack vector, there are already decentralised exchanges, if people can be bothered to use them.  Just as there are bitcoin debit cards that will fix westerner coffee cravings with no fees if people can be bothered to use them instead of trying to weigh in on a computer science scaling debate they have no technical understanding of.
The greatest attack vector is as it has always been, allow bitcoiners to rip themselves apart from the inside through fear, shake out the weak and greedy players, and rebuild, rebuild, rebuild as everything else evolves slowly and securely and the people who don't give one single nano shit about the price and speculation, continue to code and create new solutions that truly benefit humanity as a whole.
Lightning Network, Rootstock, Blockstack, for those that care to understand, fix almost everything, including instant fee-less coffee purchases, decentralised exchange and marketplaces and trusted global identity data layers forming a web of trust.
In the meantime, all that greed (ridiculous ICO's, scam exchanges and middlemen businesses that take commissions) will need to pivot or close up shop.
Remember, none of this is happening in a technology vacuum, as well as understanding bitcoin's evolution, we must see what effect VR, Global Crowdfunding, the 3-4 Billion unbanked getting access to the global economy through all this, Robotics, AI, Medical Apps, Permaculture and Green Energy revolution, the machine-payable-web is going to play in the future bitcoin is set to inhabit. 
And, most importantly, what happens when there is no need for suppliers, businesses, customers or their automated accountants and lawyers to change bitcoin at all?  What happens when central banks tether their national currencies to the bitcoin blockchain via Lightning Network and so on...
See... people in bitcoin world think it all stands still, they lack imagination and the forward thinking ideas that got us from 2008 to 2017... whereas the people building all this, and governments themselves are constantly thinking 10 years ahead and wiring into each unfolding reality a billion backup plans for how things might go...

This isn't about forcing anyone to do anything; that's what got us in this mess.
This is about creating a network where we're each incentivised to play nicely with one another, because cheating gives no benefit to either the individual or the wider group.
It begins by throwing ideology, personalities and tribalism out the window and judging people solely on the quality of their ideas, work and contributions to the group.
There is no top down hierarchy in this system, just a plethora of like-minded groups with only informal leadership... bound by a web of trust style system that eventually leads to a liquid democracy where the need for traditional governance models (and indeed political allegiance) becomes obsolete.
Everyone then has a voice and may exert influence if they are passionate about contributing.
That's what got bitcoin off the ground btw: PGP signatures allowing people to form groups where all the participants were known to be good actors.   
Issue is... how do you protect the system from the tragedy of the commons whilst simultaneously scaling such an esoteric trust network up to the masses...  all whilst bridging an inter-generational gap that has one 'side' that can barely use skype, at war with another 'side' that simply want to 'smash the system'?
So... Just as we saw emergent networks of trust blooming out of social capital accrued on networks like Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and LinkedIn, so too will we see networks of economic trust emerging from protocol iterations built on top of the base bitcoin layer with technology like blockstack.  Key is building good UX solutions that everyone can get to grips with, without needing a computer science degree.
Add into the mix, that all this needs to happen globally - and in parallel - and you can't help but be blown away at the immense beauty of what has already been achieved.  
Pineapple fund is a good example of what happens when 'permissionless altruism' is given wings by all this, but as we get even better at scaling trust we will see that these kinds of initiatives are just the tip of the iceberg.
Before all that starts becoming self evident, those who see this as a 'war' would do well to remember, there can be no outright victory... 
Bitcoin is for (and needs) *everyone*.

This is where people make the mistake of thinking bitcoin is going to exist in the world of today instead of the future tomorrow it has been invented for.
It is likely we will have voluntary taxation, where you as a citizen get to decide what and where your economic energy is spent, both on micro and macro levels.  Islam already works like this (everyone contributes around 10% of their earnings each year to causes they care about, that's it).  Don't forget too, that many countries function just fine with no income tax at all.
Bitcoin strips away all the inefficiencies that come with tax enforcement and allows all strata in society to operate on an egalitarian footing without needing to cheat the system via shell companies and tax loopholes.  Heck, even Silk Road vendors could contribute via this framework :p  
Tax enforcement then becomes a game of tax and wealth distribution.  You, as an individual, can proudly support projects and ideas through your contributions (like you might donating to a good cause or backing a kickstarter project) or elect for someone else to take care of it for you.  Or opt out all together if you are happy your peers knowing you are sitting on the vast proportion of your economic wealth, whilst doing very little to help contribute to society around you.
Your contributions are available publicly for all to see if you so wish, meaning we all become incentivised to play nicely and we all feel like we can actually see where our energy is being spent (perhaps it was funding a local mam and pap business down the road that would have normally required council handouts or helping reconstruct a school in Uganda - that's the beauty of this, it doesn't have to be limited to the geographical tax jurisdiction of your birth place).  Will we then be true 'global citizens' when all that data can be married up with Visa and Passport issuance?  I see no reason why not.
On top of that land value and property taxation can happen when land is registered on the blockchain so that we can see where inefficient use is leading to unfair property / resource distribution.
Throw in the idea of Universal Basic Income which is being pushed by everyone from Paul Graham, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg (which is just a much more efficient and fairer way of reworking the Welfare State we already have in places like the UK) and bitcoin begins to make a lot more sense... for governments, local councils and individuals.  
We end up with an economy that truly economises that instead of seeking to punish bad behaviour instead rewards good behaviour.

If the older generations want to get their tech) and world!) savvy kids investing in decent companies, then using Bitcoin as a gateway currency that makes it simple for them to onboard is the way to do it.  
Conscious and more ethical companies like Tesla will see a huge boost from a younger demographic that currently feel ambivalent and disenfranchised from that old investment world.  
No doubt small steps like this will cast out some pretty huge (and positive) ripples in markets further down the line.

Is the Statue of Liberty an advertisement for the declaration of independence?  Or something else?
Since bitcoin is neither a product or a company, what is being advertised exactly?  Who is there to profit?  How could one measure the 'success' of the 'campaign'?

Yeah I remember after Napster came out and I'm like "Oh my God guys!  Like 10 years in the future... we'll be able to pay ten quid a month for all the music in the world and it will stream instantly and... and..."
And programmer friends would be like "Duh... Nothing is ever gonna' replace CD's, people wanna' see the artwork and touch and feel it your moron."
I'd patiently explain that we'd be able to put 10,000 songs in our pockets, pick and choose playlists, wouldn't have to worry about putting CD's in the wrong cases, wouldn't spend 10% of our expendable income on music, discover new genres and styles we'd never normally have gotten access to...
Those that sat and listened started to get as enthused as I by these new possibilities, but most were like "...but muhhh. Things!"
Almost exactly 10 years later, Spotify launched and it was ten quid a month ;)
EDIT: Although, Vinyl still rocks of course and CD's do have a certain retro value (and tapes!)... I'm a huge fan of small scale limited edition releases of physical formats alongside digital release; as my friends did have a point about the artwork, which is lost in translation to digital (something Imogen Heap is looking to figure out I think :)

Focus less on the automation aspect (which just [frees inspectors needing to inspect inspectors]( and more on an immutable global ledger that leads to a world wide web of trust that ensures glass governance and maximum transparency for all 'players' regardless of status or privilege and a record of human history that can never again be corrupted by a few vested interests.

Naseem said that a *very* long time ago, and we've moved on since then.
For those oblivious to our history (and the story of bitcoin which is out there in plain sight) here's a brief rundown of some of the best bits.  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.
We know that the CIA called Gavin in back in 2011, that the Federal Reserve, Bank of America and Paypal were present at the briefing.  We know through Snowden leaks everyone who may have had a vested interest in stopping this would have known about bitcoin development since day one (the point at which it *could* have been stopped).  
We know that TOR was built by the Naval Research Laboratory and is funded by the U.S. and Swedish governments.
We know that heads of banks, academics, some of the biggest accountancy firms in the world, silicon valley leaders, facebook/apple/microsoft executives, politicians and even presidents and chancellors of exchequers have basically said bitcoin is awesome and here to stay.  We have seen bitcoin infrastructure (from physical bitcoin premises to ATM's and Debit cards backed by Visa and Mastercard) spreading throughout the world unfettered.
We know all this and yet many fail to see the obvious truth: it's time to stop fighting.  
For those that do see the truth, instead of dragging up tweets from 2013, or thinking bitcoin is embroiled in some kind of silly war, or worse, is some kind of get rich quick scheme... why not simply ask yourself: "what can I build with bitcoin tomorrow that will make the world a better place?".  
Then use the ample free resources the web has to offer and [learn to code]( design, or write a project plan with some friends, and go find some fellow bitcoiners who will help you change the world for the better.  
Beats sitting on here talking about an imaginary 'us' vs. 'them' battleground that was long ago transcended by the technology itself ;)

Has no-one learned anything from the DAO hack?  Code and information is the only true 'power' in this new world.  
Coinbase and Jeff Vs. hundreds of the smartest coders (everywhere from MIT to Stanford and UCL) on Planet Earth who will no longer be there to do peer review whilst 2X (and supporting infrastructure sites) are being prodded from every single angle by less benign coders in this space?  Do they think they're impervious to the kind of things we've seen happen to giants like Equifax?  Certainly the more kind people they alienate who would happily invest time and energy for free in helping them stay secure are going to be less inclined to do so, and so the bigger that attack vector becomes. 
Given that literally no-one on the computer science and technical side who truly cares about bitcoin's long term future wants 2X to go ahead... it seems this whole charade is now about shaking out the bad actors and parasites in this space motivated only by shortsighted greed who, through that shortsightedness mean bitcoin harm in the longer term...  
So we get to see how far corporate greed will take those who don't understand or care about bitcoin the technology and, as usual, we get to see the beautiful words and actions taken by those in this space who do...  Those who will be left standing at the end of all this with their online record (and integrity) intact for those future generations of internet historians who will be documenting every single twist and turn in this story...
Question for those on the wrong side of that history that still have a chance to change their fate, is a simple one...  
Which side *feels* right and just?  And are you prepared to stop participating in the charade and make a stand?

Apologies but I'm going to be a little blunt here...  No other coins, blockchains or ICO's interest me; everything I have described above can be achieved with Blockstack, Rootstock, Lightning, Atomic Swaps, Coloured Coins and Bitcoin as a settlement layer.
The rest are just corporate intranets and dotcom bubbles rushing into the fray with little thought about the longterm development of this space and the *point* of it all... That said, I'm happy for all this to be happening and for the folks involved to be learning the tech skills needed in this space / cutting their teeth when it comes to building new internet startups — they're all gonna' be needed when the main base infrastructure for all this matures, and I daresay there will be some amazing ideas that come of it all we can pick up later on.

AnCap means nothing to 99% of the world.  Bitcoin has no room for ideologies or idols telling others what to think and what to feel; be those pushing anarcho capitalism, socialism or any other ism or ist.
There's a big wide world outside of America that has lots of different people, cultures and value systems all of whom are benefitting from bitcoin.  Indeed, the very people that maintain the core code come from a multitude of political, religious, ethnic and geographical backgrounds.
Of course, if you disagree with that and want to join a group that believes bitcoin can be used to push an Ayn Randian agenda, then there's a lovely group of people over in r/btc that are trying just that with their own forked version of the core code.

Maintaining an open ledger *is* liberty; it's saying we are not afraid of following the moral law and trust our fellow peers - as equals - to vet that ledger.  
It is placing trust in our collective power to self govern and through that self governance develop our own ecosystems of trust *in the light* and on our own terms.
For anyone not interested in that kind of thing, bitcoin can of course be hard forked, or you can try to influence its trajectory by joining the various *transparent and open* discussion channels (IRC, Github, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, Linux Dev mailing lists etc.) since they are all open (for some nine years now) to anyone with an active interest in how best to guide bitcoin's future.

You're getting internet protocol and infrastructure services built on top of IP all mixed up.
Be good if altcoin fans could get to grips with segwit and lightning as we're now seeing *many* alts moving toward segwit integration and making preparations for layer 2/3 tech.  
Which will mean they can work with bitcoin seamlessly via atomic swaps whilst still satisfying novel use cases, just as the various additional protocols built on IP4 satisfied use cases like video streaming that the base layer wasn't built to handle.
It seems clear which way all this is going to go.  Heck, even solidity smart contracts can be ported to rootstock.

Kinda' how I see this.  Obviously there will be no market for taking such a cut in the long term, but for now it's not a bad way to reach out to a new demographic.  
Similarly with Bitcoin ATM's.  Will they really be needed in a decade?  I suspect that, just like WU and Blockbuster, they too will have to pivot if they want to keep up.

The issue is with centralised mining consortiums in this space that have formed mining pools and are buying ASICS en masse.  The recent 100m mining farms being onlined as we speak are a far cry from giving everyone a 'fair chance'.
Of course as ASICs become commonplace in consumer devices this centralisation will eventually become depreciated.  
Also worth remembering that, given PoW could essentially brick any nefarious devices everyone is currently incentivised to play fairly.  I suspect we have seen an end to power plays where a small coterie of vested interests that think statements like "those that can't afford a $20,000 node can feck off", aren't the absolute antithesis to the disparity of power and money bitcoin was created to transcend   At the end of the day it will be code built to consensus and the users themselves that decide the ultimate trajectory of this technology.

@_date: 2017-09-19 22:40:17
It's my view that anyone who says they care about animals, the environment, and their own health, who have looked into the real science, can no longer excuse eating meat.
Similarly, it is my belief that we will look back on these times where the masses worshipped and gathered around UFC, Boxing, Fox Hunting, Bull Fighting... as we do the times when humans would watch Roman Gladiators being ripped apart by tigers and lions for fun.  
I think too, we will view a species that normalised violence in this manner and thought it fine to eat other sentient, intelligent creatures that felt pain, as backward as we do those who saw slaves as an inferior 'race'. 
It's ludicrous of course that you would go to jail (at least in the UK) for killing a cat or dog in the street, but it's perfectly fine to slaughter a pig that has the same level of intelligence, feelings of empathy and love as a 5 year old child.  
There are those who will say I am quite mad to think these things; I should know, I used to be one of those people (so I cannot judge those who are yet to take that leap in consciousness).  
As such, it's rare for me to express my views like this, I don't push these ideas down people's throats, but you seem like a nice reasonable chap capable of listening and taking on ideas outside the normative social influence.

Yeah. Alan hated the movie and the mask; it missed the point of his incredible graphic novel it was based on.  Gen-Y seized it as a symbol of anarchy and fused this with anonymous which also missed the point of the original idea of anonymous (also missing the true meaning of anarchy).
This last decade will no doubt be seen as one where millennials went to war against baby boomers, with Gen-X in the middle frantically trying to build bridges.  Perhaps this is the story of every inter-generational shift in mindset as each generation gets older and wiser and those holding the ropes pass down the baton to their children?  
Question everyone needs to ask: what happens when noone needs to fight anymore and there's no longer a need to hide behind a mask?
Also interesting are Alan's views on Athenian style democracy, which bitcoin would certainly benefit from given the last few years.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:34:57
Nawww, I've just spent the last 3 years in both worlds building bridges.  I've been humbled and amazed by all the old folks in those banks and in governments on our 'side'.
I've also been amazed at how brilliant many of them are and, they too, have been surprised to see that bitcoiners aren't all crazy 'anarchists' who wanna' see that old world burn down.
What I have witnessed is *relief*.  Relief that they can pass the torch down to a newly invigorated youth that can, with the right kind of nurture, fix everything that is broken through their superior innate understanding and grasp of technology.
Do not forget, we are their children.  Many of those elders are very, very proud of all the crazy risks we've taken to make all this a reality.  I have heard those old folks shout "You're all mad!" (mad meaning 'crazy' in the UK)... as they climb aboard the rollercoaster with a cheeky laugh and glint in their eye that tells me they have as much hope and belief in all this as we all do.  
After all, many of them have seen all this before...  And we've shone light into a world where they only saw darkness ahead, and that kind of belief in a better tomorrow becomes infectious over time...  Just as it did for their generation when they were asked to step up during dark times in the past...
 
The only question left for all of us then is: what happens when we no longer have to fight?
For me, and many others, the answer lies in the stars above.

Depends how you look at it.  Would have been easier to ban it, but that would have gone against our commitments to free speech.  So it was a question of society as a whole evolving to the point where people themselves demanded change so that it became financially untenable and culturally awkward for Rupert Murdoch et al to continue peddling that low-grade pornography masquerading as 'news'.  The decision to remove Page 3, in this respect was not instigated by an authoritarian change, but by the people themselves calling for the newspaper to reflect changing societal values.  We're seeing similar things happening in the UK with bitcoin of course.  Change happens only when enough ordinary people care about making it happen.
We saw the same things with the way racism and football hooliganism was tackled in the 80's and, indeed, sexism.  I remember when most men would say "Pfftt, women drivers!" when women first began driving cars.  Now you're seen as a stupid oaf for thinking women are some how lesser drivers than men.
This thinking was changed through people like Ben Elton and the alternative comedy movement that gently used humour and intellect to challenge people's ideas, as opposed to just outright banning 'offensive' thought and behaviour which we see happening in many other places.  Monty Python used comedy to tackle religion in the exact same way in the 70's/80's and with it, went head-on against the stranglehold that patriarchal clerics used to command over the masses.
Will we look back on memes like this, our worship of false idols and false news, reality TV shows and fake celebrity fashion shows (and the hedonism it all champions) in the same way [Hogarth]( spoke about Beer Lane / Gin Lane, when society last reached a tipping point through excess greed and antipathy towards others?

This is what happens when the crowd stops laughing at an idea championed by a fringe group of apparent lunatics (think abolition of slavery, the Wright Brothers trying to make heavier than air objects fly...) to that idea then becoming self-evident to humanity at large once it takes hold.  Humanity ends up with a sort of collective amnesia whereby they forget they were ever opposed to the change...
Truth is we are far more comfortable with destruction than we are real, positive change, since destruction is something we have built coping strategies for, whereas change means embracing the unknown.  It therefore requires a few 'black sheep' to break away from the herd and show the rest this change thing really is going to be OK...
I am reminded of that cinema scene in fight club "It's called a changeover. The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea."
Back when I was at school, I remember my teachers thinking I was crazy for saying things like "computers will one day be running everything", convinced as they were these 'toys' we called home computers were just a passing fad.  
Same with mobile phones, the internet, mp3 players, smart phones...  Whilst humans will initially fight radical changes that make us reassess our understanding of the way our world (and the systems we have built) function... In the end it comes down to whether people *believe* an idea will make the world a better place for them and those around them. 
Bitcoin is interesting in that those lunatics that first got involved and fell in love with the idea, are the very people who - when they were kids - were told by the 'adults' in the room, they were wasting their time with computers...  Back then being a computer 'nerd' was something most in the class would ridicule, including the teachers.  And yet, those weird, gentle little geeks who read computer magazines, learnt to code in BASIC and first got into games like Sim City, Populous and Elite just *knew* the 'adults' were wrong...
Of course you were much 'cooler' at school if you were good at football and sports, and even later on in life...  Telling someone at a hotel bar you worked in computers would garner little more than a yawn.  
Today, intelligence, creativity and being passionate and knowledgable about a given subject (i.e. a nerd) is something people aspire to.  So much so, the Oxford English Dictionary have changed the definition over the last decade from being someone who is "insular and often ostracised by the wider group" to someone who is "passionate and highly knowledgable in a given subject area".
We are witnessing that generation of youngsters that tinkered around on the first home computers and grew up reading sci-fi novels from the likes of Asimov, Douglas Adams, Neal Stephenson... Now coming of age, after having spent the last few decades building things on the internet since its inception - only to see big business come along in many instances, and subvert cyberspace into something it was never meant to be.  They, like Tim Berners-Lee know that what we call the internet today, can be so, so much more.
Bitcoin is the first major breakthrough in realising those decades-old dreams.  
And because bitcoin touches everything and everyone across the globe, it has required myriad inter-disciplinary groups of 'nerds' from all walks of life to come together... irrespective of national flags, social strata, political stripes or individual world views, we have all had to figure out how to make this work...  And any idea that can get groups of people together that would otherwise be at loggerheads, is an idea that has tremendous potential to transform the world - and society - for the better.
In the meantime, as we collectively try to figure out how to build all this, we can expect to see big business, mainstream media and the average Joe to continue getting excitable, which will inevitably fuel the exact same types of mania that surrounded the internet dotcom frenzy...  But ultimately, those who have a deep understanding of where all this will lead can be confident the ecosystem will eventually filter out the noise, and work out the optimal solutions.

[Let me Google that for you.](
*Post-truth politics (also called post-factual politics) is a political culture in which debate is framed largely by appeals to emotion disconnected from the details of policy, and by the repeated assertion of talking points to which factual rebuttals are ignored.*
*Post-truth differs from traditional contesting and falsifying of truth by rendering it of "secondary" importance. While this has been described as a contemporary problem, there is a possibility that it has long been a part of political life, but was less notable before the advent of the Internet. In the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell cast a world in which the state changes historic records daily to fit its propaganda goals of the day.*

Same reason FB went with Bing.  This was about two massive fundamental differences in philosophy; by 2010 Google had enough clout to render a number of caveats on these companies that, back in the day, Larry and Sergey couldn't as they were just a little startup.  This was back when Bill Gates said he'd give them 'a year' before Google disappeared since Larry and Sergey knew nothing about the big boy world of business.
Yahoo's CEO, I remember being asked later on what her mission was, she replied "To maximise revenues for shareholders." 
Ask Google that question the answer is "To make sense of the world's information."  Hence people like Ray Kurzweil (who long ago worked out the world wasn't about money and profit) went to join Google as chief of engineering.  
Unheard of, given Ray has only ever worked for and founded his own companies.
This whole thing has been about "don't be evil" vs. "greed is good".  Same reason Google blocked things like Gambling ads in adwords back in the day, but Yahoo DGAF.  Of course, everyone involved in the internet has had to commit *some* evil (as Larry once said) simply to survive — the rules were long ago rigged by those early dotcomboomers who just saw this great space as another product to be exploited.  And yet, if you make great products with love and don't focus on revenues, time and time again, we find money will come as a bi-product.  Reddit of course, a good example of this. 
Bitcoin has the capacity to change those rules finally as we think about how machine-payable web and crowd based micropayments factor into an internet no longer powered by advertiser and corporate interests.
That reasoning is also why Google risked everything on the Youtube purchase (up against both Yahoo and Microsoft in a bidding war) knowing that it would likely land them in hot water with the ensuing billion dollar Viacom lawsuits and a whole bunch of class actions stacked below Viacom that would have finished Google had they lost... I had a great friend in Google working alongside the Youtube team at the time; the pressure they were under from DAY ONE, was insane.
The climax of the lawsuit and the judge's conclusion went something like this: there was no doubt Google were culpable of mass copyright infringement but the site itself was so important to empowering ordinary people in, say oppressed countries, to shine a light on what was happening, that it would be morally bankrupt of the judiciary to rule in favour of Viacom and open up all the lawsuits underneath.  Essentially saying, some things are more important than money - you guys are smart enough to go sort this out behind closed doors.
There are a lot of parallels with Youtube and bitcoin, if we think about what it's doing right now in places like Venezuela and Argentina vs. Starbucks 1st world coffee problems.  It's not all that different to civil rights abuses being exposed on youtube vs. Viacom throwing their toys out the pram over rogue Southpark clips.
TL;DR: Google's superior tech initially made sense for Yahoo (money and product wise).  Later on it was just about money, not user experience.  Yahoo is basically now a glorified entertainment portal; not a search engine interested in making sense of the world's information.

This space is about **the people in it**, people whom I know and love dearly; people who have been standing up for bitcoin wayyyy before business arrived.  They are kind and gentle dreamers, and they have all the time in the world to get bitcoin - the idea, right.  Because they love the idea of making the world a better place... many of those people have risked life, liberty and their own internet businesses in order to get us this far.
You will note that all the longest standing bitcoin businesses, investors, coders, exchanges and wallets have already sided with core, unequivocally.  The best comparison I can draw then, is what happened when a handful of the most established and respected internet businesses and tech leaders, alongside an army of ordinary users of the internet went up against (and defeated) SOPA.
It is for that reason people who believe in Bitcoin - the idea really don't need to worry about money or price fluctuations, nor selfish, greedy shortsighted businesses playing fast and loose with the most important invention since the internet itself.  Nor do they have to worry about making a hasty PoW change whilst they draw up backup plans for Bitcoin 2, should they be necessary.

That is why consensus is needed for even the tiniest change, and why there are 200+ computer geeks looking over the whole thing with a microscope day in day out.  People who know the code inside out and comprise some of the brightest computer scientists (from MiT, Stanford, UCL) we have on Planet Earth contributing daily to the code and diligently performing peer review on each others work. 
As opposed to Jeff Garzik's one man army that requires no consensus, no peer review, no Bitcoin Improvement Proposals to be discussed at length by actual scientists.  Even his last update included a plethora of work done by Core, not Jeff, Core!
I mean how can those two scenarios and the prospect of losing everyone in core, and what that means for the longterm health of bitcoin even be a debate anymore?   How could 1 brain of Jeff (which also has to devote processing power to CEO duties to his company) be preferable to the 200+ brains who have maintained the project for 8 YEARS!?  
That any of that is even being debated is just laughable.
It's like people are no longer living in anything I would even remotely describe as objective reality, especially the NYA signers, that can't see that longterm, it is their very businesses that will eventually suffer the most if bitcoin development no longer has the above credibility, integrity and plethora of talent in place.

Same misconceptions exist in UK too, people / media only recently started using the proper classifications.
It's not an exact science, but as I say, Gen-X is the delimiter we ought be using, in recognition that there are a younger generation (Z) who now have voice and have vastly different mindsets having always known a highly developed internet since their birth (I used to get all this wrong too until I properly read into the classifications).  And yes, millennials are getting old now, shit happens, tell em to stop whining :p /s
"Opinions differ as to the exact parameters that define each group... but the boomers are generally thought to have been born between 1946 (the results of the post-war baby boom, when people were so happy to be alive after six years of conflict that they jumped, en masse, into the sack) and the early 1960s. The millennials, on the other hand, take their name from the fact they came of age at the turn of the new century, so are usually defined as being born in 1982 or later.
Using the above, admittedly inexact, measure, Generation X-ers were born from roughly the mid-Sixties to the start of the Eighties."

Either they haven't had the imagination to think outside the box enough to do this, or they know - as we all do -
 that users will see through their charade and side with science over business.
Jeff's insidious blog post fraudulently passing off btc1 as Bitcoin to trick users into 'upgrading', shows just how little respect they have for their actual end users (and the transformative capacity of the technology itself).
By now they have likely experienced the cognition that every action they take to subvert the network and suppress the truth will continue to deprive them of clients, capital and credibility.  
They're pretty deluded if they think that Google, Amazon, Facebook execs, YC and all those people who have been playing this internet game since the beginning aren't closely watching the actions of participants in this space, and figuring out which people in this science project of ours deserve their future business and, more importantly, the trust and patronage of the billions of users of their services.
Ultimately, the ability for young pretenders in this space to extract capital from the network in its present form (and seduce users with paid-for propaganda campaigns) will continue to decline. 
And, whilst Erik and others get distracted by glittery little trinkets and miss the point of Bitcoin, tens of thousands of lines of code continue to be written each day unabated, as networks of unstoppable collaboration embrace Layer 2 tech, both in plain sight and behind the closed doors of internet giants and young agile startups, who are yet to make their move on the board.

Not saying vigilance isn't still needed, just that a lot of things need to be fixed on this broken internet of ours and bitcoin isn't evolving on a technology vacuum.  Nor is it magic fairy dust that fixes everything.

Mostly, it's cringe worthy and tacky low-brow wit, which is not something I am used to from my 4 years+ in this subreddit (comprising as it did mostly of technologists, entrepreneurs and computer nerds excited about bitcoin - the technology).  
The 1000-3000+ new subscribers arriving here each day are obviously going to bring with it a shift in those demographics, and younger kids from 4Chan who find this kind of anything goes 'Beavis N Butthead' type stuff humorous, will fail to see that by excluding those outside of their 'bro culture' cliques, they actually do harm to the very cause (bitcoin) they are here to champion.
At the end of the day, it's easier to recycle a meme for cheap laughs than it is to come up with original ideas and content that make people truly think (and laugh) at the same time.

Satoshi "my word is not gospel" Nakamato saw a lot of things, and was humble enough to admit wasn't always right about those things.  What with Satoshi not being able to see into the future any better than the rest of us...


It is **impossible** to *design* a perfect system (with no end state) when that system needs to constantly immunise itself against myriad external *future* developments no-one on the design team has any control over.
Satoshi couldn't have predicted what backup plans (or 'patches') were needed to be invoked from the fallout of Silkroad, Wikileaks, MtGox crashing...
In many ways, bitcoin is like an O/S; constantly evolving to satisfy new user requirements, whilst also 'patching' itself against external threats. 
Similarly, the Facebook codebase is going to have to change dramatically from the Tech Specs that were drafted Q4 2017 due to the recent Cambridge Analytica debacle that's just landed on their doorstep (no matter how much they would have preferred to be focussing on fluffy face swap apps and the like).
Case-in-point: **Satoshi would have loved it if wallets and exchanges had all ran through the one single client**...  Had the team had more time to work on that before Wikileaks blew the project out into the open, we wouldn't have seen a gazillion different wallets and exchanges creating **the very intermediaries bitcoin was invented to circumvent.**
**Yet we don't see the bizcoin crowd funding nChain (who have vested interests in wallet apps, exchanges and other middleware services) complaining that the very things they've built contradict "Satoshi's Vision" do we?**   
C'est la vie... And yet no-one actually coding all this has cried about the chaos... people just put their heads down and kept working out how to guide the protocol around the ensuing mess.  
In the end it comes down to ego and power.  The problem that the bigger, faster, stronger bizcoin crowd have with the peer review process, is that the consensus mechanisms Satoshi put in place require **everyone in the ecosystem has an equal share of voice** when it comes to figuring out how to move forward...  That can't happen in boardrooms or behind closed doors when you have a team dispersed across the entire globe, with no single person in charge.  It has to happen via textual discussions that people can move in and out of according to their interest and area of expertise, and it has to happen in a transparent fashion so that everyone in the ecosystem can be sure no one individual or group of individuals are capable of strong-arming the conversation.
Which means no matter how much you stamp your feet or cry about the way bitcoin has had to morph into something other than that which was originally 'planned' (in a perfect world scenario)... you won't get your own way if the ideas you are proposing don't stand up to calm, rational discussion and the close scrutiny that comes through the peer-review process.

This social credit thing has existed in the West for decades.  We call it a credit score (thanks Equifax).  Miss a bill payment, go overdrawn and pretty soon the downtrodden end up on a slippery slope of "sorry computer said no" to the point where they can't even get decent living accommodation... They are then preyed upon by perfectly 'legal' loan sharks... Pay day loan companies, unscrupulous landlords, gambling companies, overdraft and credit card fees enriching a few at the top of the pyramid scheme ensuring the poor get poorer...
Whilst we put a nice little spin on it all and brush these things under the carpet in the West, the net effect is that the 'social score' we call money, means those citizens who fell in that debt trap end up being denied train and airline travel by virtue of the fact they can't afford those things.  Crime and all the other negative social effects that come with poverty and greed,  goes up.
[This is why bitcoin was invented](  It's a way for ordinary people to escape the clutches of the organised criminal class; a class good folk in governments and justice departments lost 'control' of aeons ago.
In short, Bitcoin is a way for citizens and the many honest people in governments and justice departments to even the playing field.
That begins with giving individual responsibility back to everyone across all social strata.

The [2014 Umbrella Revolution]( tells us otherwise.
Having known a few people personally involved in it, from all accounts it was perfectly peaceful.  Heck, I even have an ex-police officer friend who would join the protestors there when off duty because she supported their cause.  And it was perfectly OK for her to do so.
Contrast that with the Occupy Wall Street protests that saw police billy clubbing protestors and illegally [pepper spraying peaceful students]( on campus and this whole Democracy good, Communist bad stuff isn't isn't so black and white is it?
I would highly recommend you at least go visit the people there and try to understand their culture before allowing xenophobic views like these to inform your reality.

Of course back in the day, no-one though much about which left/right divide bitcoiners considered themselves to be on.  It was all about the cool kinds of stuff people were actually building on this.
I remember getting all excited about small grassroots projects like changetip, [ and even little things like a matrix screensaver someone built that had the transactions rippling down in realtime...  Didn't matter what political 'clan' the people building those things did (or didn't) belong to.  
I suspect bitcoin's long-term success will follow the exact same adoption curve as the internet (a technology which also didn't care about politics)... Its success revolved, instead, around the amazing things being built that helped bring great creative minds together and, in doing so, enrich the lives of ordinary everyday people... across all racial, political and socio-economic divides.

Bitcoin is about empowering *ordinary* individuals to take responsibility for themselves and their own neighbourhoods.
We currently live in a world where absolute poverty is less than it has ever been in history, where global conflict is at an all time low and where the average westerner now enjoys more luxury than Kings and Queens did a year ago.
Behind all the knee-jerk headlines in that old medieval world of 'if it bleeds it leads', the world really isn't as chaotic as it may seem.
We get the leaders we deserve, and literally none of the current upheaval's we face are down to money, any more than the Cuban missile crisis or other dark ages humanity has gotten through in the past were.
Bitcoin enables YOU to start taking responsibility - in your own local community, your family and your own LIFE.  
So it us up to us to stop outsourcing those tasks to humans who are no better or worse at managing all this than we are ourselves when we figure out how to come together and effect real, positive change.
That could be through volunteering, steering local crowdfund initiatives, teaching our parents and grandparents about how to securely invest a small amount of their savings into, bitcoin and - just as importantly - how to stay safe online.
As with everything, it all comes down to education and helping others in the end, and that education process begins with using the plethora of online resources we all have for learning the *truth* beneath the headlines, and teaching and helping ourselves first, before we think about how we might help others.
Stay foolish and humble.  And above all, keep smiling through the journey :)

That's the crux of the problem here Erik; you thinking bitcoin users are customers.  
Coupled with you thinking bitcoin exchanges, and myriad wallet apps and payment gateways competing over breadcrumb commissions makes sense to users when they can use Atomic Swaps, Lightning, Rootstock, Blockstack and things like Zap to cut all that out (not to mention whatever Sidechains tech giants like Microsoft, Google and AirBnB develop with this new tech)...
So it comes down to whether users want to pay commissions for the privilege of storing their data on centralised SQL servers (which are every bit as susceptible to data breaches and them having to trust you guys as the nu-middlemen to secure their data) or whether users will choose to pay no commissions and trust no-one but the network to secure their data.
So, whilst you sit there ignoring this visionary future and fighting for those breadcrumbs instead of working with everyone to help us create this reality WITH you... you remain oblivious to things like, oh I dunno, the actual INVENTOR of the worldwide web [tweeting out his Blockstack ID]( (and in doing so giving a thumbs up to a newly unfolding reality you seem to be in denial of).
But what do people like Charlie Lee who worked at both Google and Coinbase, and those old grandpa scientists of the interwebs like Tim Berners-Lee know that you don't eh?  
You stick it to 'em mate and go change that variable with Jeff :/
And if it all goes wrong, don't worry, we'll all still be here to give you a big hug afterwards and welcome you back to the A-Team.

During that time we still had 56k dial-up modems (in the UK), although broadband was expanding in America; I would leave Napster on most of the day downloading albums, each song would take 30 minutes to an hour to download, so by the time I got back from work I'd have a full album.  I'd take a big list of the albums I'd downloaded into work and burn anything my colleagues wanted to CD (they were amazed).  Burning CD's was relatively new (most still listened to tape recordings and had no idea you could copy CDR's).  
Couldn't really download movies in the UK as Dial-Up was too slow, but I do remember connecting to an American friends FTP dump and leaving my connection on for an ENTIRE MONTH to download SouthPark the movie (I adored South Park since my Amiga days at 17 years old when it first started airing on Channel 4 here).
I remember talking to the American guy on IRC about it, he thought I was insane to be downloading a movie over 56k but I got to watch it an entire YEAR before it was eventually released in UK cinemas (I've got the song Unkle Fucker in my head now, lol).  it wasn't unusual back then to have to wait a year for movies to come across the Atlantic, due to the limited distribution of cinema reels (no digital transmission of movies so we were at the mercy of physical distribution constraints).
So yeah, I had lots and lots of programmer friends; especially on IRC.  Back then there'd be channels like     I made a few of my own which I was mod of and we'd just have these great places where people around the world would meet and share ideas...
Of course the Copyrighters came after Napster in the end (it began with Metallica's Lars Ulrich issuing the first shot).  There was a brief period where everyone would rename their albums to avoid detection (Napster were now having to ban certain albums etc.) but it was the beginning of the end of this beautiful project for Sean Parker et al.
We still had our FTP dumps, DCC transfers (on IRC)... And Kazaa would launch not long after, but Napster had shown us a glimpse of the beautiful future.  So it wasn't hard to see how it would all go when you started joining the dots moving forward.
Then the  channel appeared; I was one of the first wave of people to join and again my mind was blown about what was possible.  I nearly built something like PirateBay to start indexing the torrents but ended up working on a project called FutureMusik instead (which went nowhere; I was just cutting my teeth in the web design game).
Anyhow, that's just a brief insight into the guys and girls of the internet before big business swooped in... it was just programmers and geeks meeting in IRC and building cool stuff...

So when he is talking about the price of bitcoin being $3k+ does that mean he's now stepped down from his ludicrous "BCH is the real bitcoin" stance of a few months ago?
Since Mcafee has a vested interest in the mining and monetary aspect of all this, and chops and changes his views on everything, it's probably wise to take everything else that comes out of his mouth with a pinch of salt (especially as there's absolutely ZERO statistical evidence he's provided to back up his latest claims on monero vs. bitcoin).
Mcafee's only been involved in bitcoin a few years (if that)... seriously, what has he *actually* contributed to the BTC space?  What has he done or said that hasn't been about enriching Mcafee and co. somewhere down the line?  
If you're going to listen to the opinions of anyone, perhaps they should be the unbiased views of the many scientists and engineers that have been here since the beginning, who are beholden to ZERO business interests and whose views and experiences can be backed up by an online record showing years of selfless contributions (via github / essaying and public outreach) and who will provide you with actual evidence supporting their reasoning.
Then form your own opinions based on that evidence, but for God's sake, don't let some false emperor spouting nonsense on the *very* mainstream media you on one hand deplore for lying to the world, but will happily pull out when it props up the group narrative (even when there's no evidence to support the claims).

If they do this responsibly and add Replay Protection so we can all go our separate ways, then let them do it.  It's gonna' be many months before LN starts properly rolling out, so an interim solution that takes pressure off forcing one side to work lock-step with the other, seems OK to me.  Some people used AOL online, whereas others figured out how to do the internet thing all by themselves.

Not all banks are created equal, like all corporations, football clubs, governments, open source programming teams - they are just groups of people with a common purpose who can often lose their way.
There's no true evil; just a massive ecosystem of human beings all trying to figure their shit out...  The 'fight' is always the same; be that the Roman Empire, American Industrial Complex or our modern day 'villain', the banks...  It always, in the end about stopping greed, something we are all prone to.
If people want change, it's always been within their power to enable it within the system...  You just have to step up, look at your own footprint, and realise you are just as integral to the system functioning as everyone else.
“In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful… [This] is but the passing of greed — the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.

IMO, Intelligence was decentralised years ago.  We need to move to a world where none of us need to have secrets because, the truth is, 99.9% of humanity are kind and decent and don't want war, poverty or greed.    
It's the 0.1% of patriarchs who declared: "Give me control of a nations money and I care not who makes its laws." that are the only darkness in this world.  Do not forget, that 99% of the information in Panama leaks (the biggest leak in history) is yet to be made public.
The moment money became information, everything changed.  
But to get to where we're going we need a new human narrative and we need to forgive (but not forget) those 0.1% who - through their hubris and addiction to money and power - nearly lead the world into the abyss. 
If we are to accept that "the worst evil in this world is committed by those with the best of intentions." then we must forgive and move on... together... 
That new human narrative?  
It lies in the stars and the inner-worlds we now get to create with VR and all the other technologies evolving at the same breathtaking speed as bitcoin.
After all, we are the generation Carl Sagan had been waiting for... ;)
*"The simple passage of so many generations will have changed us. Necessity will have changed us. We’re an adaptable species. It will not be we who reach Alpha Centauri and the other nearby stars.

For all of our failings, despite our limitations and fallibilities, we humans are capable of greatness."*

You may not believe this, but without the support of some of the good banks out there, bitcoin would never have gotten this far.
I keep trying to explain to everyone here that the fight is over and that we'd do well to concentrate on the very cool stuff happening.  Some people though, have no idea what to do with themselves when they are told they no longer need to fight.
At the end of the day, doesn't matter what I or you think, we are each responsible for our own sovereign wealth.  Not for you or I to tell people what to do with their bitcoin.

He, like many online commentators nowadays, sounds *completely insane* to those who long ago stepped away from the left/right echo chamber and began looking at this world (and the people in it) as one... 
As for OP: I'd focus less on attacking the guy, and more on just going out there and showing the world all the good people in this space who are helping to make their local communities (and the world) a better place.

It's very eloquently written and clearly comes from the heart, but it's an appeal to emotion instead of rationality.  And, frankly, it is insulting to the scientists that risked their lives and liberty to get this off the ground, wayyy before you even got involved who have done nothing but present you with logic and reason based on their experiences in building code for decades now; scientists who, like myself, have already had to build stuff that has had to scale to meet the needs of millions of users on the internet itself.
Even the leading quote: "Give me control of a nation's money, and I care not who makes its laws" echoing the sentiments of 'money lenders of the old world' from which it is derived, shows us how you are in a constant state of fight or flight that sees this 'game' as an "us" vs. "them" zero-sum affair.  This does not work with the caring, sharing scientists that built the internet and this new money-as-information technology that needs 100% of the planet onboard if it is to truly reach its potential.  There is no "us" or "them" in that future.
To get there you must be willing to cede the 'control' you think you exercise in this space to the network itself (which means embracing Lightning Network and the *true* decentralisation it offers).  There is no room in any of this for nu-skool middlemen (sans the suit and tie) with designs on mimicking the ranks of the very elitists they sought to dethrone. 
You know all too well that Lightning Network and solutions like Zap completely resolve both current scaling issues and middleman transaction fees and directly address all the problems you cited in the blog (and then some).  No 2X increase could scale to the billions of transactions that Lightning will allow, nor does it fix problems with centralisation or allow for actual zero-fee transactions (which are technically feasible with LN).  But you cannot possibly advocate the scientifically rational solution because it means you would need to rethink how your fee-taking businesses would operate in this new world.  
If you continue down this path, you run the very real risk of completely alienating all the good people coding in this space (I would remind you that Jeff's updates include a whole bunch of code written by Core)... If you push them too far don't be surprised if they take their skills and enthusiasm over to something like Litecoin where they will actually be appreciated.  Who knows, without them having to wade through a wall of FUD penned by people with zero Computer Science credentials each day, I daresay productivity would go through the roof.
At this juncture then, if you really do care about the people that built all this, and our collective future together, the only sane thing for you to do is to retract NYA support and give Core the time to see if LN and Segwit as it stands will fix the issues you raise.  And then discuss calmly and rationally - with Core - a sensible roadmap for blocksize increase should it be deemed necessary later on.  
We've all been wrong about stuff in this space a million times...  It's OK to be wrong...  You will gain huge amounts of respect for simply admitting emotion got the better of your rationality, then standing aside to let the scientists get on with the rocket science. 
Then perhaps, as everyone breathes a huge collective sigh of relief that we're all back on the same page, you and Jeff can pump the profits you would make from the inevitable price increase in establishing your own Layer 2 R&amp;D team so you can get onboard the greatest technological breakthrough to happen to bitcoin since its inception.  
Heck, I'm sure people can even throw you a few whitepapers and ideas your way for free that you can all begin working on immediately to help pivot Shapeshift / Bitpay into something spectacular.

Well unlike you, it seems, I haven't such hubris that I will seek to tell others how the future will unfold, nor do I deal in schadenfreude.
You are right about one thing though: this will most certainly be about the companies, products and services that people choose to use.
Crucially, they will be the companies, products and users of already established internet giants (Amazon, Alibaba, Ebay, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Braintree, Stripe, AirBnB) that will ultimately decide which code fork and which team of coders are embraced by the industry at large.

I guess tribal*ism* is just another type of ism.
And yet many in the younger generations - through their upbringing on the internet - do not see these divisions...

And yet here we are having a civilized conversation as if none of that matters ;) 
Because the truth is none of it does matter: strip away all those pre-concieved notions of 'difference' and you realise we ALL have far more in common than we do differences.

Lol, sounds awesome!  Although I think the story sounds closer to real life than we'd like to imagine hahaha :D
At the end of the day, there have been plenty of options to escape this if people actually look into the ethics of the companies (and banks) they are dealing with.  Most people basically can't be bothered to switch / walk an extra few yards to an ATM that isn't backed by a bank they know have been exposed for happily funding land mines etc.
Many westerners like to complain about leaders, corporations, bankers, but do very little to actually get up and do something about it (i.e. join a credit union, fully research bitcoin and install the app, etc. etc.).
As always it takes a few good people to lead the change, and eventually the rest cross the chasm when it all becomes self-evident.  Ozone layer depletion in the 80's (it took one British scientists 10 YEARS to crunch the NASA data to finally prove to naysayers CFC's were destroying the planet).  Eventually the public went "Oooooh that sounds bad, maybe I should switch to CFC free aerosols / fridges instead.
This is no-one's fault; we're all so busy doing jobs for 'inspectors to inspect inspectors' (that could basically be automated tomorrow) that by the time everyone has gotten home from the 9-5 slog, switching bank account / making ethical company purchases isn't something anyone can devote significant cognitive processing to.

What I find is that whilst many of my comments and outlandish thinking may be met with derision by the braying, senseless, mob, there will be the quieter ones reading and watching who have found a lot of meaning and value in the points raised.  
Eventually, those ideas (civil rights, gay rights, bitcoin) take hold even in the minds of those that originally opposed them since truth has a habit of eating away at the psyche in times of quiet contemplation.

My mum is same age...If your Dad can use Skype and Email the following should hold true...
The moment she installed a wallet on her smartphone and I sent her some play money over, she could see instantly why it made sense (at least in theory) just as she was able to understand why that first email she received in the 90s was better than waiting for a letter from the postman.
So I think the trick you're missing OP: just show your Dad how it works in practice instead of asking him to imagine it working or waxing lyrical about the monetary theory behind it (even if that's demonstrating a phone to web wallet transfer).  Certainly, it makes *more* intuitive sense than it did for same old folks to make that cognitive leap in the 70s when money was suddenly stored on weird bits of plastic we call debit cards vs. real tangible physical stuff you put under the mattress ;)

Hahahaha, well that's what happens when an intellectual elite, and hard leftists say to poor working class people up north "You're all racist!" instead of realising they have legitimate concerns.
Of course, the whole thing was a result of fake-news and addiction to false idols and 'experts' spreading nonsense and using tools like facebook to buy people's minds...  
The fact that for 4 days after the election the most searched for thing on Google was "what is the EU?" tells us we have a democratic and voting process completely detached from knowledge based decision making.  Of course that's what blockchain was invented to disrupt and fix.
The result was pretty good on the whole, as it has bought lots of people together otherwise separated by political rivalry, and galvanised a youth into actually getting off their arses and taking part in the electoral process, which the Jeremy Corbyn 'stalemate' has proven they are capable of.  
As a result we have had a complete change of working staff in parliament seeing a rush of new, young ideas and tech savvy MP's keen to fix things and show the older folks how all this new technology can be deployed to rebuild the democratic process.
The house of lords are seeking to further disrupt the vanguard by bringing the voting age down to 16.

That would lead to the same concentration of wealth that got us in this mess.  The future is likely lots of cool little experiments with alts that can run over the bitcoin blockchain via Lightning Network **Atomic Swaps**.  This way the vendor / state / bank can remain completely agnostic to which alt you prefer to use since anywhere that accepts bitcoin accepts the alt by default with seamless 'swapping' to bitcoin via Lightning Network.
Ultimately that leads to every alt in the ecosystem getting a chance to thrive without needing to worry about friction moving in and out of the global blockchain economy.
This means the 4 billion currently unbanked can now bootstrap entirely new local economies in a matter of seconds once all the tools are streamlined and they are hooked up to satellite uplinks / meshnets.  Central Banks and local western economies wishing to move away from central control and re-establish what the Bank of England / UK Govt.

You make a good point also :)  I would add, one must not forget in the 8 years from genesis block and the £0-4000 ride we've witnessed so far, there is one group that have been both scientists and investors who know this inside out.  And there's a good chance they also got to understand the old world inside out too given they presided over and built the computer systems that govern it (96% of all money is digital afterall).
Old world just needs some time to catch-up and find their place in a world where the new system insists players entering do so with a little more than profit incentive as a reason.  For some, that will mean going back to school, just as businesses did in the 90s to adapt to what the internet would mean. And prior to that, understanding the dangers CFCs posed to the ozone layer in the 80s which required the entire business world to adapt or go out of business.

Given those needs and that code is all still evolving... In 1-2 years time, when the bitcoin core code has tens of thousands more lines (and users, merchants and machine-payable solutions) when LN is in full swing, can you and tell us where bitcoin will be then?
How about services like [Zap]( that allow instant commision-free micro payments and can scale to billions of transactions via sidechain tech?

It is no more the business of British people to tell Americans who they should or shouldn't vote for in their two-party democracy ;) any more than it is the business of Americans to tell Iranians what system of governance (political leadership, central banks etc.) they should or shouldn't choose as a people to get behind.

At the end of the day, the most loved things don't need to be sold.  Google doesn't need to advertise google search, Piratebay didn't need to advertise, Popcorn time didn't need ads to go viral, Github has no need for a global marketing push... Same with Linux and the internet itself.  
When bitcoin has done advertising, there's been a wonderful playfulness to it, or they have been virals made with love, by the crowd and the users themselves.
By contrast, Ethereum has used multi-million dollar ad budgets to sell the ideas of multi-million dollar corporations born off the back off ICO's and old world shareholder agreements.  We see a diamond logo representing status and privilege, the DAOHub resurrecting religious TAOist symbology (DAO means the source of everything) even going so far as subverting [sacred religious symbology](  That worries me because, not only is it offensive to the original context of those images and ideas but, if you know your history, it's exactly what Hitler did with the Swastika (he used an old Taoist symbol knowing it was already imbued with power, and turned it slightly).  Not that I'm saying the marketing teams behind ethereum did any of this with malign intent.  It's likely more naive ambivalence to our cultural histories.
Note that even Ethereum's answer to the Lightning Network - Raiden - uses the name of the [Streetfighter character]( that fires Lightning.  Either this can be construed as a snide little in joke or the exact same willful appropriation of symbols from the past that imbue great power over the psyche of individuals on a subconscious level.  
All that niggles me in the exact same way that cynical dark magic marketing tricks such as the McDonald's "I'm Lovin' It" slogan troubles me since it is this very dark art that has lead a Western world into rabid over-consumerism through this stimulating of artificial needs and wants.  A world of greed that, if bitcoin network infrastructure pans out as many of us hope, bitcoin will be the very antithesis to.
I have no personal interest in buying the minds of others; be that through paying people to be stuck in a cubicle developing code they could be writing on a beach, or buying gigantic billboards that weave dark magic into the public consciousness.
There's a great [short essay]( here by Alan Moore that covers this stuff.


Sure, I have no greater insight into where all this leads than anyone else and I wish all those involved in ETH the best of luck, and offer them the same level of heart-on-sleeve advice (for what it's worth) as I do anyone who approaches me in this space.  It will certainly be interesting to see what impact Blockstack, Rootstock, Lightning Network and Atomic Swaps will have in this space and what it means for ETH and the myriad alts out there.  All 'sides' have a lot more work to do if we are to seriously see this as a technology being adopted by central banks and governments, alongside the 'ordinary' masses.
As to where I fall: I pledge allegiance to bitcoin because of the people involved that I have been there with since the beginning of all this; and who I know have been through hell and back for this technology, risking life and liberty in order to pave a safe passage to the many new entrants (eth included) in this space.  I have seen the developers of Rootstock cry during their presentation because of the mountains they've had to climb for this technology, and that really tells us how much bitcoin - the idea means to the people most shaping its future. 
We can be thankful it is those early bitcoin pioneers who were brave enough to stand up and say "enough is enough" at the very beginning of all this, and risked everything to get bitcoin to where it is today that are not only steering the good ship bitcoin but who - as people - I know for a fact care very, very deeply about the world and the future of our species; people who have cried tears of sadness and joy many times along this journey and will pull out all the stops to ensure bitcoin thrives.  Not because of a paycheck, but because of an idea.
Ultimately, this all comes down to the innate goodness of the people involved and their willingness to collaborate and share ideas freely with another in order that we may build a better world for EVERYONE with this technology; whilst having a lot of fun along the way and going to bed at night feeling they've made the world a better place.  You can't put a price tag on any of that.
Everything else is just theory ;)

Why would anyone want this nerd money?  What problems does it solve that fiat doesn't do better?  I also thought like this back in the very early days.  And, I mean, I'm a coder / computer scientist... I even integrated BTC for a non profit music project back in 2012, and even after that I didn't truly see it as anything other than 'nerd money'... 
Then... after being utterly disgusted at the Cyprus bank bail-in back in 2013, I went back to bitcoin to see if I'd missed something... It was only then after reading [the whitepaper]( did the penny finally drop.
It took months of research and I had lots of questions for the community not answered by any of the material online but it wasn't too long before it all began to make sense...  Nowadays, if you're truly interested in learning about all this it's a lot easier; you will find most of the points you raise above have been answered far more eloquently than I might be able to here, and there's just mountains of content online that can teach you about it all (from university clubs and courses [such as those at MIT]( to books like [Mastering Bitcoin]( to 100's of weekly [meetup groups]( around the globe.
Would also recommend [Andreas Antonopoulos' Youtube Channel]( as a great starting point.
None of us can tell the future, but nor can we have a truly well rounded opinion on something new to humankind unless we are prepared to put in the work to properly research it, and thus help ourselves get better insight into what potential new future might be up for grabs.  Certainly, we don't wanna' be the guys and girls who said computers / mobile phones / internet were passing fads.  
Thanks again for your interest in all this, and your more than healthy scepticism... which tells me you're smart ;)

Well society is always evolving.  There was a time of course when Alan Turin - the father of modern computing, was forced to either suffer chemical castration or prison for being homosexual.  He ended up killing himself.
I'm sure people said during his time "Homosexuality has always been wrong and always will be wrong in the future."
Who saw Gay marriage sweeping the world the way it did?  Or the pope coming out saying he thinks it's all perfectly fine and that thinking needs to evolve.
And of course people told us bitcoin would never work back in the beginning.
On the subject of objectification of women, here's the current thinking in the UK: 
Maybe we went a little too far thinking that using a woman with her tits out to sell beer was a good idea?  Perhaps implants and fake boobies, and mini-skirts, and fake tans and high heels isn't sexy any more?  Perhaps intelligence and brains are more important than those things?
Veganism is also becoming huge in the UK, and it's likely in years to come we will look back on the days we ate meat in the same way we look back at Roman Gladiator sports and wonder WTF we were all thinking, just as I think back to the 80's and vividly remember UK football fans throwing bananas at John Barnes (the only black footballer of the time) and doing monkey gestures from the stands, and everyone thinking it was normal, whilst I would sit there thinking "WTF is wrong with people?".
Long way off yet, all this equality stuff... In the meantime, feel free to call me a retard, just as those who I spoke out against for being racist back in the 80's also called me a retard.

You have erroneously conflated the instructions behind the Bitcoin CODE as it currently stands with bitcoin.  As if it is something that stands still in time like the American Constitution.  Perhaps when later 2 tech (the http of Bitcoin) becomes more easily understood by those involved in this, things will start making more sense.  
I discovered bitcoin within the first month of its announcement on hacker news.  It took me many years to truly understand its implications and I was wrong (and right) about a lot of things until the penny finally dropped in 2012.  I continue to be wrong and right about a lot of things.
I have been programming computers since the age of 7, was one of the first kids in the UK to use a consumer mouse (the AMX).  Was there at the beginning of the internet and prior to that the public domain movement on the Amiga.  Technology and computers are my love and passion.  
At the end of the day I don't BELIEVE in anything except the many beautiful people I've met along the way invested in this as a tool to unite humanity.  
Everything else is just theory.  And I, just like you, have no crystal ball that will determine the future of all this.  We are both free, in that sense, to think for ourselves.  
Been wonderful discussing this with you.  I'm very excited to see how all this unfolds.  May the most beautiful ideas transcend the bitter, petty rivalries that set us apart.  
Thanks for all your bitcoin support, you are as integral to all this as everyone else is.

And yet there are plenty jobs and companies now where payout is made in bitcoin (especially in the BTC space).  When we get to a world where no fiat on/off ramp is needed and suppliers, businesses and consumers are all transacting in BTC, the old fiat world becomes irrelevant to how many loaves of bread 1 millibit will buy ... just as the value of old Roman bronze coins are irrelevant to how much food you can buy with your mastercard ... then this whole bitcoin thing begins to make a lot more sense.

Being the little underdogs working behind the scenes in the light again sounds like a lot *more* fun if it comes to it...
Eventually all (crypto) rivers will follow back to the people who built this (and the internet).  There is no dark magic that can stop that eventuality.

My point was more directed at how China have already embraced p2p payments and how they might enhance those solutions with bitcoin over time; much like how the mastercard and visa networks have been piggybacked to enable bitcoin debit card payments.

Well... until you've read our whitepapers and had discussions with the academics, politicians and old/new world businessmen that have been holding this world together (which I've just dedicated the last 3 years of my life to doing - as well as being a designer and coder I'm a systems analyst)... I'm not sure you're qualified to tell us what will or won't work, since you haven't been privy to any of those ideas or the things we've all been working on, discussing and developing.
Reddit of course, isn't the platform for these matters, so I think we're done here.

Costs a lot of money (electricity, staff, printing presses, ink, economists) to print paper money.  Arguably, a lot lot more given it isn't simply digitized (although 96% of all money is digital of course).


Thanks for the well sourced wiki link.  I am indeed aware of the controlled supply and deflationary nature.  The discussion here isn't about Keynesian vs. Austrian Economics and the various merits of controlled supply vs. quantitative easing as a means to (attempt) the same thing.
We are simply asking this: is there a centralised group that are currently seeing the lions share of profits by virtue of them monopolisng profits from the output of that controlled supply?  Are we happy with those companies patenting technology that, like the internet, should in the view of many, be released patent-free if bitcoin is to remain true to its social function?
(See defensive patenting vs. the kind of aggressive 'for profit' old school patenting (also called patent trolling) we're seeing some companies in this space attempting).
Do corporations operating to old school profit incentives help progress the species further, or should bitcoin evolve in the same way the internet did at the beginning?
Ultimately this comes down to whether you are comfortable with a small coterie of men being given an uneven distribution of power and money.  If you are truly wanting to see decentralisation of *all* of this, then one might argue that mining also has to be decentralised if we are to avoid the same mistakes of the past.  
Of course you don't have to agree with these different visions: there is a project called Bitcoin Cash that has some very lovely people that are only too happy to back big corporations that don't see any problems with mining.  That is the beauty of bitcoin - the idea.  It is open source code that any individual or group of individuals are free to change and try new things out with.
The group is called r/btc and there are some very smart people in there that are trying to do this a different way that I think you may find interesting.
Ultimately, I don't know how the future will unfold any better than you do, all I an do is attempt to join the dots.
Here's some interesting links on the mining decentralisation front that you may be interested in:
[China’s Midea Group household appliance giant files patent for Mining Bitcoin via appliances](
[Bitcoin mining lightbulb built at Blockchain summit] (
[Andreas Antonopolous - the end of mining centralisation] (
"...But now that we have arrived at the highest silicon fabrication density (at or below 16nm), the entire industry is bound by a much slower process, with 2x increase every 18 months at best. **This new dynamic removes many of the incentives to centralization of mining.**" - Andreas Antonopolous
Obviously this is going to stir up a fair bit of cognitive dissonance for those people who would rather the status quo remain, so I understand why some find the inevitability of mining decentralisation so hard to accept.  
In the meantime, thanks for all the bitcoin support and the great conversation!

This was all tackled about 5 years ago but glad to see the discussion being opened to a more mainstream audience.
Before everyone gets in a knee-jerk panic about all this: the same applies to practically *any* site an unsuspecting individual may visit that contains links to circumspect stuff.  This is not grounds for blocking the entire internet or arresting internet surfers for having landed up on one of those sites.  
There are plenty of solutions in place for figuring out those who are actually engaging with and propagating that stuff through the darkweb and other places where 99.9999% of this is going to be happening... 
Are we going to argue that books and public libraries that contain potentially subversive stuff should also be banned?  What about 4Chan / Bittorrent / Youtube / Google?
Or has humanity actually learnt its lessons from the many other times in history we thought it a good idea to burn a whole bunch of information?
There are pros and cons to every new technology.  
The case for having an immutable global public ledger in time that the whole of humanity can write to without an invading army coming in and deleting / rewriting history, far outweighs the lame and stupid stuff people are going to inevitably do with that technology as it matures.

'the government' comprise a big group of ordinary people who have pensions, mortgages, kids who are students, wives and husbands who are doctors and nurses, just like you.  Some of those people went into politics to make the world a better place, just as many of those that joined the police, judiciary, the UN and other institutions joined those places for good and noble reasons.
And then there's a thing called civil servants, who watch over what those in 'the government' are doing, and separate houses and chambers that ensure the balance of power never goes too far in one direction...

Of all the shows I cited, only Ben 10 could be considered a kids show (Simpsons, Family Guy, Southpark are very much aimed at adults).  I could have also mentioned Hollywood movies like "Blow" and "Deadpool" both of which featured bitcoin, and the entire (definitely *not* for kids) second series of Mr. Robot which I hear was basically just one long bitcoin advert.
Does this embedding of imagery and ideas in movies and kids shows have an effect?  Sure, you only need ask why McDonald's and others have such huge marketing budgets for sneaky product placements in kids shows to see how their dark magic is performed.
Away from that darker side: tackling social issues through kids cartoons and movies is vitally important to their future development into adulthood and in nurturing the right kind of ideas we have agreed as a group we want them to learn about; Gay Rights issues, for instance, were subtly tackled and talked about in kids shows in the 80's (Rainbow being a good example in the UK) in order to prepare the younger populace for a radically shifting societal mindset, away from commonly held discriminatory viewpoints that may have been held by their parents.  Subtly introducing them to bitcoin opens up the exact same 'curiosity pathways' in their young minds and helps them question commonly held assumptions about 'the way the world works'.
As we know from [the Renaissance]( and Enlightenment periods that came before, it is always artists that carry the message of transformation to the masses; be that through the printing press, the paintbrush, or today's modern equivalents of the street artist murals, TV screens, memes and youtube virals.  
TL;DR: **Yes, bitcoin sewing its way into the consciousness of popular culture via trusted and loved TV shows and artists works is incredibly important in crossing the chasm of awareness.**  Especially as none of those messages have been paid for, but are there as testament to the creators and writers belief in the technology as a force of good.
Indeed, even though I had known about and been involved in bitcoin since the first month of its release, it was only after watching the bitcoin music video [Cyprus Anthem by Zhou Tonged]( that I finally realised bitcoin was *the* solution to many of the problems myself and others working in the light had been so focused on fixing since the financial crisis began.

There's equally valid arguments for reducing blocksize.  The reason we don't do it now is very simple: it doesn't have consensus.
Everyone needs to stop treating this like a race to the finish line.  There is no finish line any more than the internet has a finish line.
I have been programming for 33 years, have studied TWO computer science degrees, know 17 different programming languages, have built and architected websites single-handedly that have had to scale to millions of users and I was there at the very beginning of the internet (and before that the birth of home computers)...  And I am humble enough to say even with all that computer science knowledge, I don't know the intricacies of the core code itself well enough to feel I can have a proper informed opinion on this debate... but I trust those who do, since they got us this far, chiefly by not rolling out ideas that don't have the consensus of the group as a whole.
It's about time people started appreciating the gargantuan work they've done in holding all this together, given the metric tonne of shite that has been thrown at bitcoin over the years.  Otherwise you all run the very real risk of them simply disbanding and going to a group that does appreciate their efforts where they can rebuild from scratch.
Guess what happens to the faith all those on the right side of history have in bitcoin once the team that built it are no longer here?  Guess what happens to the development progress (and speed of that development, security, robustness)...  Guess what happens to the precious price so many are obsessed by?
Many good people like myself who have risked much for bitcoin over the years, will simply go with core and leave 'Team 2X' and the whole bigger, faster, stronger brigade to their [empire of dirt](  
TL;DR: We need to [start enjoying the journey]( and refrain from weighing in on emotive technical arguments we are not qualified to enter into...  Half the problem is the scientists aren't being given enough time to do the science because they're having to wear so many different hats to deflect the armchair 'experts' and business people who have no business in science and haven't the slightest clue how to build systems of scale.
We must have patience and recognise that amazing things like the internet, if done properly, take TIME to build, and that we have a **duty of care** to the many good, ordinary people in this space who have put significant savings into bitcoin to ensure those savings remain harnessed to a blockchain that puts security and integrity above all other considerations.

That's a weird question.  It's like saying "Does New York use bitcoin?"
Of course, North Korean's could just as easily use Potcoin, given Dennis Rodman recently visited NK again advertising it on his shirt.  
Or, any given crypto currency for that matter, including cryptos that no-one even knows about that aren't readily available on public exchanges and would have far greater levels of anonymity baked in.
Or, if they actually wanted to use something that is truly anonymous and untraceable (which bitcoin is not), then they could just use good old fashioned physical US Dollars.
TL;DR: Bitcoin is about *the* worst currency you could choose for doing shady stuff.

The system in China you are referring to was actually implemented in the West decades ago in the form of credit checks and black marks against people's names (i.e. Equifax) that would effectively mean those that screw up couldn't get things from tenancy agreements to basic mobile phone contracts.  In some cases, not even bank accounts.  
The beauty of the system?  If you didn't take out credit, your score was zero meaning even though you've never borrowed anything, you faced almost the same restrictions as someone who had been in debt...  What a beautiful system for duping people into borrowing beyond their means and continuing the cycle of debt slavery.
Meanwhile, those with inherited wealth, get to do the loaning out as the interest being paid making poor people poorer further enriched the lives of the middlemen and women at the top of the food chain.
The system I propose is *completely* different and requires no centralised entities owning your data (it will be built with blockstack for starters).

What we have to do with *all* these things is go wayyyyy back in history and see how we got to where we are today.  So you have Korea split in two, the Russians took the top half, the Americans the bottom half.  Meanwhile the UK until 1996 had Hong Kong.  We also had the Russians taking East Berlin, Americans the rest of Berlin after WWII.
The Brits created Pakistan so that Muslims could go chill, and Hindi's could get on with their thing in India.  Israel had its little thing created after WWII...We had communism doing its thing in Eastern Europe... and, whew, see how complicated all this is getting?
Berlin wall came down in 1989, iron curtain came down afterwards, EU was created, and free passage between European states began.  It's worked rather nicely, despite all the stupid arguments over legislation, European people themselves are more united than ever.
Then the internet came along, and rather than slap a patent on it and let each country have its own corporate internet, Tim Berners Lee thought it would be much more fun to let the entire planet figure out its differences via one messy global database of truth we call the internet.  Wikipedia has meant we could all begin figuring things out without any one government able to twist that truth.
The Arab spring happened as Arabs began to piece together their history and realise they could all be one.  Occupy saw 250 camps over the world protesting against corporate greed; the pope came out in support, Hong Kong followed with their protests.  The zero day exploit "Red October" swept the world and global intelligence became more and more decentralised, Ed Snowden, Julian Assange did their thing...
Then Trump happened and all of a sudden, just as the left thought they were getting a handle on all this, Trump threw a brick through it all and managed to galvanise the ultra right to the point where America is now gripped by actual facism, in much the same way the Greeks saw the rise of the golden dawn nazi part at the height of their financial unrest.
That's very scary, for everyone involved, none more so than N. Korea, whose only defence against the possibility of invasion from a rogue U.S. administration looking for war, is to up the ante.  That's the stupid zero sum game everyone has been playing.
But look between the lines... Even the U.S. main cyber defence team recently resigned from the administration under protest, such is their concern over Trump's ability to govern sanely.  Do you really think he could come anywhere near to actually pushing the button?  Do not forget that Nixon tried that on Vietnam and watergate ensued.
The solution, as always, can only come from rational, calm, dialogue.  We did not fix the IRA bombings in the UK with more bombings, it took Clinton and John Major to broker a peace armistice and listen to both sides of the debate.  China / Russia are the peace brokers in all this.
Bitcoin / North Korea stuff is fluff, we all know about the Super Dollar, and the fact N. Korea can print U.S. Dollars better than the U.S. can.  
China aren't turning the screws on ICOs or Exchanges to hurt bitcoin *or* N. Korea IMO; they're doing it to help legitimise bitcoin in the long run and help save ordinary Chinese mamas and papas who want in from getting screwed by scam artists.
It would make no sense for North Korea to be using Bitcoin, since it's infinitely more traceable than using cash or a hidden crypto they could create themselves that doesn't even need to ever go public.
Everything is a mess out there, but not beyond redemption.  Clearly the solution is to empower individuals within North Korea with internet and bitcoin and crowdfund campaigns (with the blessings of the ruling classes) and for the people of the world to take an active role in helping the country get on its feet, just as it took grassroots campaigns to help with the recent Syrian refugee crisis gripping Europe. 
It will take time, but it took time too, for the Berlin wall to come down.  We know Eric Schmidt (president of Google) has visited Kim, we know Dennis Rodman has too.  We need lots more people to go out there and offer their ear and expertise without passing judgement or trying to impose western morality on them.  
Iran is fast becoming one of the most popular new tourist destinations for Europeans, Dubai turned from desert town into thriving metropolis in just 6 years when it realised it was running out of oil.
Humans are capable of greatness when the need is greatest.  
One way or another, we'll all work this out, but we won't do that by repeating knee-jerk nonsense from for-profit newspaper articles, written by journalists who have no real clue what they're reporting on since they are just pawns in the information mind game being played by all sides.  
Best to just ignore it and concentrate instead on whatever you can do within your own sphere of influence to make the world a better place.

Yeah exactly, it should give you a nice simple 'league table' of all Bitcoin posters that shows you those that have consistently made positive contributions over the years, giving you a decent pool of users to think about bringing into mod induction.  
If you were to add flair to those users too, new people coming in will be able to differentiate between comments/posts made by veterans with positive karma and those new to all this (which in turn should help mods filter new posts coming in).

Largely because there are 4 billion people on the planet yet to get online...  As they arrive, the old hierarchal systems that defined our inter-subjective realities begin to lose authority over our minds.
It's subtle, but you can see the moral arc bending towards truth, if you look at the bigger picture beyond the neon glare and noisy soundbites.

"If you don't believe in freedom of speech for those you oppose then you don't believe in freedom of speech at all" - Noam Chomsky
It is for the group as a whole to decide what behaviour and morals we deem to be good for wider society, it's not for me to 'approve' what can or cannot be said, and that goes for you trying to impose your viewpoints and subjective worldview on me.  This is of course going to vary from group to group due to the various cultural inferences that have informed our worldviews and understanding of subjective reality.  
The questions we need to ask is "what are we trying to achieve by using divisive language?" "Do we believe in diversity and that we are essentially all the same?"
It all comes down to whether you believe in the essential good of humans and our ability to get along even when we disagree.  
As surmised by Einstein in his observation that "the *most important* decision we make is whether we believe we live in a hostile or friendly universe."
Given we essentially all came from the same two human ancestors... go back far enough and we are all related to the same mother.  There's really no such thing as 'race', they're just cultural determinants that do nothing but distract us from that essential truth.  
Personally, I choose to stick to objective reality and steer clear from opinions of other people seeking to tell me how inter-subjective reality should work; afterall it's *objective* truths (e=mc2 etc.) that got us from rubbing sticks together to building space rockets and bitcoin.  
And it is my right to choose to believe we live in a friendly universe, just as it is your right to believe in darkness and entropy if you so choose.  And I will believe that kindness, optimism and love is more contagious than negativity and hate.  
And I shall continue to take my cues from great wise ancestors like Carl Sagan, as I look to the stars, and dream of bigger things for this young species of ours.

Well that really depends on whether you see the nuclear family as 'family' or are capable of seeing the bigger truth: we are *all* family.  
Each of our lives is exquisitely inter-dependent on every other life; from the cocoa bean workers that lead to the barista serving you your morning coffee... to the mail woman driving the newspaper delivery van to the computer scientists maintaining your favourite online digital currency... so that you might send it to help your brother out in a foreign country via the smartphone those Chinese workers diligently assembled in factories...
We all need each other... This realisation that we are all one, that there is no 'other' is key to getting this crazy mixed up species of ours off this little rock into the stars we came from...
Carl Sagan eloquently summed this up: "The old appeals to racial, sexual, religious chauvinism and to rabid nationalist fervor are beginning not to work... A new consciousness is developing which sees the earth as a single organism and recognizes that an organism at war with itself is doomed. We are one planet."

It's more about taking individual responsibility and not blaming everything bad that happens on other people.  That old elite have managed to hold shit together for this long and you ought have a bit more respect for what our ancestors did to keep you fed, clothed and the petrol, luxury consumer goods and all the other 1st world distractions that mean you currently live in more abundant luxury than kings and queens experienced a 100 years ago.
You have never had it so easy to go out and crowdfund something amazing for your community, to go start a patreon account, to go travel the world and live in India with your feet up for the cost of a few months labour in the west.
Sooner you all realise it's not the 99% vs 1% that's the problem, or the system failing us, but people failing themselves through blaming others... the sooner we can all get along and concentrate on the very important mission of colonising the rest of the galaxy.

Sure, Paul Graham wrote a wonderful essay about this:
[What You Can't Say - Paul Graham](
*"When you find something you can't say, what do you do with it? My advice is, don't say it. Or at least, pick your battles ... Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.*
*The most important thing is to be able to think what you want, not to say what you want. And if you feel you have to say everything you think, it may inhibit you from thinking improper thoughts ... Within my head I make a point of encouraging the most outrageous thoughts I can imagine. But, as in a secret society, nothing that happens within the building should be told to outsiders. The first rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club."*
It is a good set of ideas to follow, until the time comes to start enunciating your thoughts and tackling idiotic thoughts head on (no matter how much it may upset the normative social influence).  Don't be afraid to think and say things differently or to stand up against bullies; it is people who do that who help pull all of humanity forward.
In the 80's this meant standing up to racists, homophobes and misogynists.  In the last decade it has meant people championing things like bitcoin standing up to old world patriarchs and intermediaries.
Stand up for those things and people you believe in, and feel OK being the black sheep that asks "But, Why?" to the braying mob.  But know when and where to pick your battles.

Was interesting to see the fallout from the internet was handled in the UK; the Royal Mail Post Office still thrives and arguably offers the best service after fully embracing internet disruption to rapidly upgrade services fairly early on.  
Probably helped that it was invented by a Brit mind, and they had more of a head start to think about the havoc email was about to wreak upon the world... Naturally public services (British Telecomm, Post Office) would have been briefed very early on and thinking about backup plans well in advance.

That's odd, couple years ago CW told the BBC he would never ever do another public interview with the press, yet here is Alan linking to a 2017 GQ interview.
False idols gonna' idol I guess.  That goes for Alan and anyone else on twitter you guys are linking to in this reddit who you think have some kinda' handle on the future of this...  Alan is in finance; I'm sure he is a lovely guy but his opinions are irrelevant to bitcoin, as sure as the opinions of the VC's that built the LHC are irrelevant to the physicists working out of CERN.  
Bitcoin is a COMPUTER SCIENCE project.  
I urge everyone to think for themselves instead of listening to weak minds talking about other people and events they don't understand in the middle of a science project they have no scientific credentials or expertise in ever shaping or truly influencing... Those opinions belong in entertainment magazines next to celebrity gossip columns.

The most eyebrow raising aspect in all this? 
DCG **acquired** Coindesk, which can surely no longer be classed as an 'independent' voice on bitcoin, given those 50+ — it's actually [**ninety one**]( companies DCG now have in their portfolio.  
Coindesk can basically flip the price and future of those companies with any given article and I don't think a disclaimer at the end of articles can cut it (it's the articles that *don't* ever appear we need be more concerned about).  Like it or not, bitcoin's biggest news outlet is now essentially compromised by the vested interests of its owners.  
Given the nightmare we have all just lived through of media moguls with vested interests buying the hearts and minds of the public and governments via lobbyists, one must wonder if DCG consider 1984 to be an instruction manual :D

I remember reading something Lord Goldsmith (who started London's amazing Goldsmiths university of the arts) said once "if you want to understand markets don't ask an economist ask a psychologist".  Before he died he also said to his son, Zac Goldsmith "Son we've gotta fix capitalism, it's gonna' destroy the world." (A tale Russell Brand told once on his TREWS show IIRC).  
His other son, Ben has since gone on to find myriad NGOs with the specific aim of applying 'band aids' to this ailing system in need of a web 3.0 upgrade.  
Conclusion: There are many good people who have been involved in this for aeons, the world over, and across all social strata.

You know, before I visited and lived in a communist country (Vietnam) years ago, I used to suffer the same Western brain damage conflating communism with some kind of dystopian evil empire where everyone would be oppressed and crazy.
It was watching a [BBC Top Gear Special]( of them touring Vietnam that made me think twice.  
I can honestly say, Vietnam was one of the safest, sweetest, happiest and most stunning countries I've ever visited.  Not without its problems (like all countries) but I was amazed to see kids running freely in cities without parents needing to worry about their safety, and families congregating together at night around open BBQ's on the street, playing music and laughing and welcoming happy western tourists at every opportunity without wanting to take advantage of them.  I didn't see a single fight in the 6 months I lived there in the middle of the thriving, busy city of Hanoi.
And to think, just 40 years ago Nixon came within inches of nuking them...  Could the same story of NK be told one day in the future when the current troubles are muddled through?  Have we all forgotten the Cuban missile crisis and seen how beautiful Cuba (and its people) have come to be since (with one of the finest free healthcare systems / green energy programs in the world)?
I was also amazed at how little Western consumerism had infiltrated Vietnamese lives (shopkeepers will turn you away if they think you won't fit into some of their clothes for instance, even though it means losing sales - unheard of in the West!).  And yet that mindset happily lives alongside Western commerce (sans the overbearing billboards pushing it down your throat) - Starbucks and modern shopping centres / consumer electronics stores could be found in different districts just a short ride from the centre.
The internet was basically fully uncensored there too (afaik) and cafes would share open Wi-Fi networks freely; in fact there's more sites blocked in the UK I think (for copyright reasons) than in places like Vietnam.
It didn't surprise me one bit then to hear bitcoin would be legalised there early next year. 
I've travelled to some 60 countries so far on this life journey and Vietnam is up there in my top 5 favourite places...  my take away is the same as Aldous Huxley's "To travel is to realise everyone is wrong about other people."
Given my experiences in Vietnam and other countries - when we take into account the terrible past (and current) Western/Eastern propaganda machines... I cannot possibly deem myself qualified to have an opinion on North Korea one way or another... I still remember vividly the IRA peace armistice,  the Berlin Wall coming down in 1989, and the iron curtain coming down soon after; and can see how far we've already progressed in such a short period of time...  
We only got there through travel, dialogue, and embracing and respecting each others different cultural views and ideas.
As such I prefer to follow Dennis Rodman's lead and go visit NK myself, meet real ordinary people living there, and see things with my own eyes before forming an opinion.  
Does that sound like a reasonable perspective to have on all this do you think?

People get a kick out of schadenfreude and pushing other people's buttons.  Getting angry actually fuels their asshattery.
We have been set terrible examples by our 'leaders' who have sold the world into the erroneous belief that it's ok to lie and cheat your way to the 'top'... People have been put in little tribalistic boxes to fight over breadcrumbs tossed from high, when the truth is we live in a world of abundance with enough to go around for everyone.
There is no left/right divide.  Planet earth has no *real* borders, and humanity has no real divisions... a child makes no distinction between skin colour, nationality, politics, religion, sports teams... it's all taught.  


Absolutely.  
Fortunately, the global movement that is bitcoin (which crosses all borders and social strata) has enough facts on its side, you ought to be able to nullify much of the anti social behaviour and ignorant commentary through polite, calm, and logical reasoning.
If you are unsure of the facts, or can't back up what you're saying, another tactic is to write an angry response and then... DELETE IT and move on before posting.

You're right of course (reminds me of Carl Sagan's bozo the clown quote).
The difference here is bitcoin isn't a product or company that has ever needed to be sold.  It is an idea that no-one owns.
The only invention of this magnitude comparable in modern history *is* the internet.  
It being released to the world patent free, with no restrictions and no company, branding or advertising in tow, is what gave the idea of the internet the oxygen it needed to spread like a virus.

Bitcoin is for everyone; you are free to take the tens of thousands of lines of core code (as Roger and others have) and create an alternate version, with a new vision if you wish.  If it that vision has merit people will support it, as we're seeing with BCH.  That's how the system was designed.

The difference between your worldview and mine, it appears, is that I don't see any sides in all of this.  There is no left or right way to get to the promised land, just myriad concessions to be made from all actors playing the game.
Once we accept that the person you think is the 'enemy' could well be *you* given a different cosmic dice-throw, environment and upbringing, do we not all then struggle toward the same outcome, albeit via different paths because of our different subjective views on reality?  We cannot expect a CEO of a bank to understand the computer science behind bitcoin, but neither can a computer scientist quite understand the myriad socio-economic issues that need to be juggled to allow that bank to embrace these changes.  
We don't get to just smash the doors down on a world that took thousands of years to build, no matter how true our intentions.  It all takes time, and patience and humility.
In the end, the only sane thing to do is to stop playing the blame game and get busy building bridges to the new world we all want to see happen for our children...  Bitcoin isn't a magic wand that fixes everything, first we need to fix the hearts of human beings who see everything as a fight because of the brain damage we've all been subjected to by false 'experts' who told us that's 'human nature'.
If you can't see how Mike and the things he has done for us all (including the stuff he did at Google to secure our data in light of the Snowden slides he was privy to) then you suffer the same myopic view of humanity as those you think you oppose.

You are simply looking to distract from the discussion, because you have no good arguments for the points raised.
As I said in my very first reply to Erik, I support the right for you and others to go take bitcoin in whatever direction you see fit.  It is not my concern if you think a blocksize variable change in 2X and a continuance of mining centralisation is the way forward, nor is it for me to tell you you are wrong.  As such, I sincerely wish you good luck with that vision.
For me, well, I discovered bitcoin via Hacker News in the first month of its release and have been actively involved in promoting and helping spread its propensity for social good for many years.  I've been working on the internet since the beginning, was there in IRC the first week Bram released Bittorrent... 
As such, I put my faith and energy with the coders and tinkerers who, like me, fell in love with computers and the internet back in the early days, who believe "information wants to be free" and see much more than business potential with bitcoin... 
May the best ideas and those visions capable of solving the many real world problems we have in bringing humanity closer together, be those that prevail.

In my view, Satoshi were right *and* wrong.  Wikileaks would no doubt have survived with quiet, off-the-books transactions without needing to blow bitcoin out into the open so soon.  Julian had enough [well-connected friends]( and supporters in the media looking after him in the UK, for Wikileaks to have survived without BTC.  Who really donated to them anyway that couldn't have done it quietly off the books?  
The Wikileaks association even meant really important net neutrality organisations like EFF had to withdraw their early support for Bitcoin; support which was, arguably, even more important for getting Bitcoin recognition in the 'right' places.
Had bitcoiners waited and been patient as Satoshi had urged, we'd likely now have decentralised exchanges and marketplaces like OpenBazaar all running through the client, as per Satoshi's original vision for how things should develop.  Ironic that many of those who are today clamouring on about the importance of "Satoshi's Vision" are the very same 'anarchists' that said "screw Satoshi's views on this, we're supporting Wikileaks." back in the day.
Everyone conflates the 'heat' comment with the Gavin CIA meet, but forget that ~~Silkroad~~ Bitcoin had been operating quietly for years and plenty in intel must have known about its existence, and yet still let it mature... Indeed Google knew about bitcoin - Mike Hearn was one of the first programmers on core, coding in his 20% time at Google HQ. 
Likely then the 'heat' Satoshi were referring to was politicians / MSM over-reacting / over-eager newbie programmers / and big business swooping in who saw bitcoin as just another internet service to exploit for profit? (similar to how Microsoft treated the internet itself and protocols like POP3 at the beginning - did the internet really ever need more than one browser and one email client?  Likewise, does bitcoin really need more than one rock-solid decentralised wallet and exchange?).
Given the mess of ICO's, exchanges and centralised wallets and payment services that have come off the back of that Wikileaks announcement, one can't help but wonder what bitcoin would look like right now, had the ecosystem been free in those early days to continue quietly evolving to run through one decentralised client with a massive global web of trust bolted on top — instead of coders having to wear multiple hats and expend energy fire-fighting an old world up in arms.
Fortunately, we're going to see just how true decentralised services work with Lightning, Blockstack and Rootstock... just a few years later than planned, had the ecosystem had more of that 'quiet time'.  But hey, optimistic programmers are always over-promising on delivery dates, so no great shocks there :)
Still... the billion backup plans that have required everyone in this space to come together and put differences aside, whilst running around the globe like lunatics to keep the good ship bitcoin afloat... whilst a lot of hard work, has also been a lot of fun for those that deeply care about the people in this space, and the role this technology will play in improving all our futures.

Which come from both ignorance and fear of letting go of control.  It is this stone age belief (borne of fear) that through the control of others 'for their own good' we create a safer world, when science tells us the opposite is true.
Hence those emperors with no clothes who mean well, but whose forcing of 'good intentions' are the very foundation of many human ills that have lead to such a [huge disparity of 'wealth' and 'power']( in this world. 
To build on an observation by E. O. Wilson, one might say "bitcoin exists in a bizarre time of stone age emotions, medieval beliefs, and god-like technology."

This is not exactly the case.  Reddit was fundamental in getting bitcoin to where it's at, especially as at the beginning most in the space were too wary to attach their real identify to twitter accounts.  As bitcoin is now the next cool thing to be into of course have a whole bunch of hype and people who are all of a sudden 'experts' in bitcoin now on twitter.
It's a sort of hyper reflection of the West's addiction to celebrity and idol worship playing out there.  But it's a massive echo chamber of talking heads and people who really have no business or credentials to back up their highly vocal opinions.  
And they certainly have no clue why bitcoin was invented. 
To truly understand that means letting go of control and power and our addiction to money, fame, and ego which, really, is all twitter is about for many (my opinion is bigger than yours).
There's light on the horizon, LukeDashJr's sybil-resistant user polling is perhaps a glimpse of where this is going to go and how consensus decision making (on macro and micro decisions) can be widely distributed amongst all users of bitcoin.  I call this the wisdom of well informed crowds, key is ensuring all those participating are informed of the facts in a non-biased way before voting.
In the meantime, messy as it is sometimes, Reddit remains ground-zero for community outreach, crowd-based filtering of facts, and dissemination of information that effects the ordinary user.  It is also the most important outlet for layman education and reaching out to and spreading bitcoin awareness to the rest of the world who are not part of the twitter echo chamber.
And let's not forget, the actual *real* work continues to happen quietly behind the scenes; many of the people doing that work you won't see or hear on twitter taking part in the 'debate'.  
In many ways, much like politics in this post-facual era, it's a pantomime that doesn't much care about objective reality.  Often, taking the higher ground means letting false idols idolise whilst quietly getting on with the work.
Will be happy to see the B2X camp disembark so we can get back to focusing on the science of all this and getting this subreddit (and the community as a whole) focusing on moving things forward more proactively...

That little trademark logo just shows how they are the absolute antithesis of what the open source collaborative project that is bitcoin represents.
If blockchain.info really wanted users to 'be their own bank' and actually valued them as free-thinking individuals they would give their users a **choice** as to which chain they wanted to follow.  I trust they have the technical nous to add a simple button that allowed users to default to their preferred blockchain?  


How do we define 'significant value'?  Last I checked 1 BTC = 1 BTC.  Value when?  Today, tomorrow, a year from now?  What gives them the right to define what represents *significant* 'value' and, worse still, *if* (or when) they will "make that 'value' available"?


Did they learn nothing from the BCH fork where we saw difficulty flip-flop over a number of weeks?  Are they going to jump from BC1 to BC2 as hashrate bounces, pushing unwitting customers around like little pawns?  What are they going to do when they are deluged with customer support requests on a daily basis?  Deliberately confusing average users like this, is a huge failure of their duty of care - to their customers *and* those hard working folks in the community who have kept bitcoin going for the last 7 or more years.
What kind of mess is blockchain.info itself going to be in, when 90% of the community are expecting their site to return results for *actual* bitcoin - as defined by the entire community - as opposed to those few signatories in the NYA? 
Their fetishisation of the status quo and blinkered obsession with hashrate shows a distinct lack of vision and imagination as to where this rapidly evolving technology is heading... 
What about when home mining kits become available and further distribute mining power?  
Japan have [just announced they'll be capping electricity costs for home miners]( and Dubai [recently revealed the Vega home mining kits]( bringing ASIC's down to 13nm and making them a consumer reality for the first time.
How about Layer 2 tech and talk of truly game-changing ideas like Bram Cohen's new environmentally-friendly [Proof-of-Space algos](  How about all the work being done around [Shnorr signatures]( that truly addresses the scaling issues?
TL;DR: The entire statement **exemplifies their short-term profit-driven motives and underscores their lack of understanding** of both bitcoin - the idea, the computer science behind the protocol, and where this industry is going to be post-November.
The irony of all this?  If they are to regain any credibility with the vast majority of users, scientists and truly innovative companies in this space, their best hope is that hashrate stays with Core and these ill conceived PR stunts ignorant of the technology are quietly forgotten. 
As always, it's in the hands of ordinary users to transcend all this by only going with and promoting companies in this ecosystem that we know have - at their foundation - sound ethical principles in-line with the open source, collaborative nature of this visionary project.

There will always be those stuck in the status quo who can't see the unfurling of new technology and the ramifications it is going to have.
One only needs to look to predictions from Bill Gates and Ray Kurzweil to see how easy it is to 'see into the future' when you spend your day looking through actual real world breakthroughs in technology as opposed to discussing "events" and "other people".  
People will put Bill and Ray on pedestals because they are still part of a herd that 'follows' and worships 'experts' that stand in a spotlight.
This has always been the way with me (I fell in love with computers at the age of 5 years of old, I'm 40 now).  Started my first school mag at 5 too (was all about computers, ha).  My english teacher told me "Get your head out of computer books.  They are just a passing fad!".  
I was the first at my uni to get a mobile phone back in the day (it was the size of a house brick and cost like 1 quid a minute for calls).  A bunch of my friends had pagers (the only other demographic that had pagers were doctors, nurses and pot dealers lol).
I was the first in my peer group to get an iPhone after seeing Steve Jobs "one more thing..." years before when he hinted at what was to come.  I'd sit in the pub with my friends telling them how smartphones would be ubiquitous and we'd see games and apps like spotify replacing the need for their iPods and most would tell me I'm an idiot, but of course some would listen and get as excited as I as they saw the potential. 
And of course I was the first to discover bitcoin (within a month of its announcement on HN).  Same thing, many calling me an idiot, others would get interested and ask me more... 
You just have to keep your head down and keep pushing forward and realise it doesn't matter what the herd thinks; it will all become self-evident to them in years to come and they will forget they once opposed the changes.  
In that sense being "right" or being made fun of, doesn't matter.
With all this comes the understanding that 'investing' is as much about putting mental energy into the best ideas and communicating them to your friends as it is backing it with your economic energy.

Exactly. It is my belief, that we are less than a year away from the first major western city in the world to fully embrace bitcoin as their defacto currency.  
And they will side with Core, since the thought of their citizenry lining the pockets of a new coterie of emperors with no clothes 'taking a cut' on other people's economic energy is incongruent with the very principles of bitcoin's core ethos.

Insofar as a few grammar fixes, and removing that wall of text in place of a direct link to the "Can't Be Evil" source document (for greater clarity / reference authority).  
But nothing in terms of the points I raised have changed.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:41:57


The core code *is* the bitcoin protocol.  


That's why I qualified it with the words... since they got us this far **and will not do anything outside of consensus**.


No.  They don't.  I've met many in Core, I've seen Adam speak.  Everything is transparent, go look in the dev mailing lists or IRC chats...  Without Adam there would be no bitcoin since it hinges on his hashcash work.  There'd also be no satellites in space,  the single greatest achievement for truly getting bitcoin to the 4 billion people unbanked whilst Jeff and Roger complain about 1st world problems which bitcoin debit cards can solve whilst we wait for real work to happen on the scaling and fee reduction side...
Without Adam, there'd be no Lightning that offers *true* scalability, no "Can't Be Evil" corporate philosophy as ground-breaking as Google's "Don't Be Evil" was back in the day.


There's a big difference between an old whitepaper that is no longer relevant to a rapidly evolving code and use case environment and the best ways to approach the plethora of design challenges ahead... My opinion, as a COMPUTER SCIENTIST is that I do not have enough knowledge about how the various functions within the core codebase work, for me to be able to suggest the best approach to scaling.  
However, given we need to scale to Visa levels and greater long term, I can see why blocksize alone does nothing but add bloat, and still gets us nowhere near to Visa. 
I am also really, really excited about what LN, Blockstream Satellite, Jack Maller's ZAP, Rootstock mean for the many projects I have in waiting.  


Please go do your research and make up your own mind... It's not for me or anyone else to tell you what to think.  There's plenty of data out there...  In addition you are free to signup to the core dev mailing list, join the IRC channel, or the Lightning slack community.  Free to go learn to code at CodeAcademy and, rather than passively observing all this, you are free to start rolling your sleeves up like Jack Maller and other brilliant youngsters and make an active contribution... 
Whilst doing so you will get to know the very kind, gentle beautiful people who have been building all this from the beginning and have risked both life, liberty (and sanity!) to get us to where we are today.  I've really, honestly never met so many wonderfully generous people in all my years on the planet, all united behind such a beautiful idea.
Then perhaps say thankyou, thankyou for keeping my bitcoin safe all these years, thankyou for making that your primary concern in all this.  Thankyou for not running like team Satoshi did when things got really rough... I really, really do appreciate all your continued efforts.

I've deleted the comment as last time a 5 hour debate ensued when I mentioned to Daniel he and Microsoft don't get to play Blockchain Kingmaker in any of this, nor use a billion Microsoft 'users' as unwitting pawns to try push this technology where a few 'chiefs' deem fit.
Until old incumbents begin to realise their *users* have data rights as *citizens* that supersede any and all commercial interests, I fail to see why or how Microsoft or anyone else have anything to say in how this should all develop.
I hope the penny finally drops for all the new techies and commercial entrants in this space that the "blockchain all the things!" hype of the last few years has had them all digging holes Layer 2 is about to fill in.

I'm not an investor, I'm a computer scientist.
The advice I and most honest bitcoiners will give is the following: "It's still nascent technology, never invest more than you are comfortable losing." and "Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, it is a fix the world scheme."
As the UN World Food Programme using bitcoin to feed people, and those people in countries like Venezuela and Argentina using bitcoin to shield their assets will attest, bitcoin is a lot more than some novel investment instrument.  
Of course, it's up for you to go do the proper research and understand just what it meant for the world when the [double spend problem was finally solved]( and why the underlying technology is such a huge leap forward.

Well society is always evolving.  There was a time of course when Alan Turin - the father of modern computing, was forced to either suffer chemical castration or prison for being homosexual.  He ended up killing himself.
I'm sure people said during his time "Homosexuality has always been wrong and always will be wrong in the future."
Who saw Gay marriage sweeping the world the way it did?  Or the pope coming out saying he thinks it's all perfectly fine and that thinking needs to evolve.
And of course people told us bitcoin would never work back in the beginning.
On the subject of objectification of women, here's the current thinking in the UK: 
Maybe we went a little too far thinking that using a woman with her tits out to sell beer was a good idea?  Perhaps implants and fake boobies, and mini-skirts, and fake tans and high heels isn't sexy any more?  Perhaps intelligence and brains are more important than those things?
Veganism is also becoming huge in the UK, and it's likely in years to come we will look back on the days we ate meat in the same way we look back at Roman Gladiator sports and wonder WTF we were all thinking, just as I think back to the 80's and vividly remember UK football fans throwing bananas at John Barnes (the only black footballer of the time) and doing monkey gestures from the stands, and everyone thinking it was normal, whilst I would sit there thinking "WTF is wrong with people?".
Long way off yet, all this equality stuff... In the meantime, feel free to call me a retard, just as those who I spoke out against for being racist back in the 80's also called me a retard.

You could be saying the same thing about the tenderloin in San Francisco, or the inner-city slums of London or Birmingham (I have lived in and grown up in some of them) hence I qualified my statements above with "not without its problems (like all countries)".  
And btw, what makes you think I'm white / non-asian exactly?  
I happen to be from a working class family, so don't also make the false assumption I'm from some privileged collegiate background, or out of touch with the common struggle of ordinary people; it just makes you look like a privileged presumptuous little know-it-all, that jumps to discriminatory conclusions before properly weighing up the available evidence and facts... 
All pretty big assumptions for you to make given about the only thing you can even *reasonably* glean from my post is that it sounds like I *might* be from the UK (which does not mean I'm necessarily Caucasian, given the huge ethnic diversity in Britain) don't you think?

Lol.  Very impressive young human!
Now... are you aware that the word idiot, comes from the Greek Idiote and is actually a term used to describe those that chose not to specialise in one career?
Today we would call them polymaths or individuals.  Some of the greatest polymaths of the past were Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Buckminster Fuller.
Idiot is a word derived from the Greek ἰδιώτης, idiōtēs ("person lacking professional skill", "a private citizen", "individual"), from ἴδιος, idios ("private", "one's own").
Of course, Chris Morris predicted all this 10 years ago, in the seminal classic, Nathan Barely.  Here we can see the sketch where the character played by Julian Barrett laments the "Rise of the Idiots".
The Sandiwch of course is considered Britain's "biggest contribution to gastronomy" and came from Lord Sandwich who once had the genius idea of putting two slices of bread together for supper.  
He was, of course, quite idiotic!

Thanks for the kind comments :)
I've played a somewhat active role (albeit from the sidelines) in both worlds, and was amongst those bitcoiners that helped fund ethereum via their ICO because I think we should be supporting any and all who want to push this technology to its limit.  I was also present at the ethereum Barclay's launch in London and whinced a bit at one of the young kids onstage who, replying to someone in the audience who asked "What's to stop JP Morgan forking this technology and doing their own version?" to whit the guy replied "Nothing.  But guess what?  Ethereum's the only game in town."
I believe it's that kind of hubris that got us all in this mess in the first place...  But hey, they are youngsters new to the internet who are rightly excited about this amazing stuff they've all built, so their hubris can be forgiven (I hope that doesn't itself sound condescending).
Criticism aside, I think ETH has played a valuable role in forming a sort of walled 'technology sandpit' where finance incumbents can experiment and learn about the tech, safe in the knowledge there's hierarchical leadership and a Swiss foundation backing things up, meaning barriers to entry (and risk exposure) are lowered.  
It's also taken the heat off bitcoin being the 'only game in town' and with it, the speculation, bitter attacks, and businesses that see bitcoin as a threat (and blockchain as just another tool for bigger, faster, stronger profits).
With that we have seen the rise and fall of DAOhub (which was primarily focussed on ROI) and witnessed lots of slick marketing agencies and 'decentralisation' hype which has flooded into the ethereum ecosystem...  Which then lead to the latest ICO frenzy (which feels a lot like the dotcom frenzy of the 90's).  
Ethereum's walled technology sandpit is predictable and comfortable, its governance makes sense to the old world; much like the iPhone App Store might feel more comfortable in the hands of your Grandpapa over a rooted Android phone...  So all this has created some nice paying jobs for designers, coders, marketing firms and so forth on the ETH side...  and, just as with the jobs created in the dotcom crash, those skills *are* going to be needed in the future, regardless of how this plays out.  Especially when things like Solidity language support is ported over to rootstock.
Meanwhile, bitcoin is the 'slow and steady' tortoise to the ethereum 'move fast and break things' hare...  In that sense, it's a tale of inter-generational and idealogical differences ("save the world and get 'rich' doing it" vs. "save the world and create a resource based economy where no-one needs to be 'rich'", ideas borne of those hackers and tinkerers that built the internet on the maxim "information wants to be free").  
One scheme has to be built with love, the other can be built with money.  One side will see artists, musicians and bitcoin dilettantes spreading the message through their art, embedding the meme in movie dialogues and holding up 'buy bitcoin' signs in FED meetings; the other side will need to pay for billboards and product placements in those movies and tv shows to capture public awareness...  One side 'feels' right and good and exciting to be a part of for the common masses at large, the other feels like a shinier reflection of the old world using the same marketing tricks to sell us into the ideas of a few men and women stamping NDA's on everything that comes through their doors.
The truth is, whilst we still have one foot in that old world of 'for profit' gatekeepers that revolves around ROI and vested VC interests; it's going to take awhile yet before those ugly addictions to money and power and "please sir can I have more?" can be truly transcended by a global crowd that no longer needs to seek permission from anyone but the global network itself... to trade freely with one another in ideas and energy.  For that, we each, as individuals, have to step up and realise we always had the 'power' to trust one another all along.
Bitcoin is messy, chaotic and unpredictable... and yet - at its very foundation - stable as a rock *because* of the leaderless 'chaos' that lends to the ecosystem itself having to find the optimal solutions...   This anti-fragility imbued within a consensus-driven development process is bitcoin's *real* breakthrough...  Its ability to take onboard a whole plethora of differing opinions and voices and - through that diversity of ideas - grow ever stronger and more confident (albeit slowly and cautiously).  But what gives bitcoin its greatest strength is the people in love with bitcoin - the idea; people who help shape its future every day, and whose enthusiasm and lust for real, positive change is contagious.
And it is for that reason you will *never* see an ethereum symbol [spray painted on a wall]( [embedded in children's cartoons]( or [lovingly pasted into public spaces](
I think in years to come, as we finally put this era of the "passing of greed" and artificial scarcity behind us, and realise we live in a world of abundance that merely needed a better measurement tool... we will look down from our rocket ships at this pale blue dot of ours, and wonder why it took so long for us to get there when it was so obvious, in hindsight, that money was nothing but a collective delusion holding us all back from the cosmic revolutionaries we always were :)

What this is an example of is people with a truly original idea borne out of love (that has already gained the network effect and love of the people) being copied.
Those that copy come along and tweak the invention slightly and declare it superior to the original.  
The only way to then get it out there is to hire armies of people and blitz the airwaves with marketing speak.  Nefarious "business has to be ruthless" Gordon Gecko types will then try to belittle and rubbish the original invention in order to strongarm the public into buying into their competing vision.
That is 'greed is good' capitalism at its finest. 
Case-in-point: IBM and Microsoft came up with competing internet protocols after Sir Tim Berners-Lee came up with the World Wide Web.  They were arguably technically superior but missed why a patent free open, borderless network (TCP/IP) was more beneficial to humankind.  Tim's original idea had already won the hearts and minds of the world's internet pioneers and, by extension, the people using their creations.
Same with my friends mp3 solution.  All he'd done was copy a solution to a problem that had already been solved.  There was no need or will for 100s of software companies to rewrite code to cater for an algorithm that saved 40-50% more harddrive space.  Especially as everyone knew Moore's Law and internet streaming would eventually mean the space saving would be an irrelevance.  
We're seeing the exact same thing play out in this space, but much more rapidly...

Those shielding assets in Venezuela and other places suffering currency pressure would disagree with you.  It is *really* important that we stop thinking about where we are TODAY and think to where this technology will be in the world of TOMORROW.  Yes there are teething problems (because it needs to scale, because 1000-3000 users a DAY are coming to this reddit wanting to USE bitcoin).  Meanwhile, things like Lightning, Blockstack, Rootstock, movements like Bitnation and myriad other developments are working round-the-clock to evolve this technology further.
The most eloquent explanation for all this came from Chamath at facebook, which he laid down back when bitcoin was something most hadn't heard of.
[Facebook Executive says Bitcoin Is Gold 2.0 - It's a Huge, Huge, Huge Deal!](
"I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fun, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. Because what you're talking about right now is, for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right? The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government. It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina. Everywhere you have currency pressure. Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. And then, after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism." — Chamath Palihapitiya
So, have patience, let the ecosystem develop and worry not about the opinions of those who have little expertise in the fields of computer science or internet.  Worry even less about those who aren't visionary enough to see the world in which bitcoin exists tomorrow.
After all those *actually* building all this aren't worried about the views of those people (and never would have gotten it this far if they had).

You should see server farms powering stuff like ec2 instances.
The fact that Google has managed to migrate their server infrastructure to green energy tells us we're not far away from distributed cloud computing that has zero negative environmental impact.  
Same is happening in the mining space.  Expect consumer level mining chips in everything from smart phones to living room heaters (Google nerdalize to see some of the tech there).
In the meantime, energy giants are turning to mining to divert otherwise wasted energy into bitcoin.

You're talking to someone who was here back when there was only one exchange and had to ride the entire MtGox shitstorm (and every one that has come since).
Bitcoiners advice on this matter is consistent: if you have bitcoin on an exchange it is not yours and your coins will always be at risk, just as the fiat in your bank account is open to the kind of risks that come from capital controls and the bail-ins we saw in Cyprus...
So your advice is great, your reasoning however (and invocation of conspiracy theories) is nonsensical and based on zero empirical evidence to support your claims.  
I know you mean well, but you cannot on one hand get angry at MSM and people like Dimon spreading FUD without evidence to back up their claims, and then go do it yourself when it suits you to spin your own fantasy narrative.

IMO, forward thinking governments long ago realised bitcoin is not the threat — doing the same thing over and over again as people teeter on the brink of revolt... *that's* the threat.
Bitcoin is just science and mathematics, and it gives everyone a way out of the madness if we get it right and don't repeat the mistakes big business made in trying to control the internet...  I say this having met quite a few of the people from that 'old world' and they're as excited as the rest of us at what this could mean for transparent governance and the removal of corrupt agents in all this.  Optimism and belief in our ability to all collectively come together around this and build a better world is the real contagion that has brought us here.

Well if you think about it, the forking (and panic that comes with it) is really no different to the various infrastructure hacks (Bitcoinica, Silkroad takedown, Mt. Gox collapse) that bitcoin has had to ride through to get to where it is today.  
Each stumble shook out weak, average, and greedy minds who saw bitcoin as a get-rich-scheme in the exact same way these forks are doing now... leaving the true builders and architects of all this unfazed, since none of those past infrastructure failures changed the trajectory of the longterm aspirations they had for bitcoin - the idea. 
Difference now of course, is that it's no longer just a tiny group of crazy rebels dealing with the fallout with nothing but their coding skills - it's an entire sprawling global network of professionals, artists and altruists who share the same belief in bitcoin, and the role it will play in building a better world.
Having 350,000 Reddit subscribers also makes bitcoin.org and its supporters a force to be reckoned with, no matter how much the other 'side' throws at the core group of bitcoin believers who fell in love with bitcoin long before they ever arrived on the scene...
And that's why, in the end, it all has to flow back to bitcoin - the idea.

I said we had a civilized conversation... not that you *were* civilized (that would require broad assumptions at such an early stage in our relationship :p)


I base this on having travelled to and lived in some 60 countries on the globe and stayed with local families and ordinary people representing nearly every social strata imaginable...  Yup, we're basically all the same.  With the same needs and wants, fears, loves, hopes, dreams.  Indeed, I've seen more happiness and laughter with the street kids living in Indian slums than I've seen sat in millionaire's penthouses overlooking Canary Wharf in London.
Get to that self actualisation part in Maslow's hierarchy of needs and all bets are off.  We're all on the same [hedonic treadmill](


Sure there are physical differences... But I'm only interested in what lies within the heart and minds of people.  Latest neuroscience tells us even male and female brains are virtually identical, same is true of the cognitive capacity of all 'races'.
Race is in fact a cultural determinant invented by the white man.  And, since we all came from the same common human ancestor, we are quite literally all from the same Mother if we go back far enough.


Nawwww, that's fear and ignorance talking...  And nothing good comes of either.  Indeed, this crazy little family of ours wouldn't have got this far if it did.  Why?  Because there's always those 1 in 3 of us that will [refuse to participate in evil]( for the greater good of the group.  Optimism, kindness, love and sharing are all traits that strengthen the group as a whole as well as the individuals within it. 
Your only choice in the end is to either step up, and light a candle if you truly want to help lead us to a better world...  
Or you can choose to sit there and passively watch the world change for the better anyway waiting for a rock (that will never come) in the hope that you can find some sense of primeval patriarchal purpose amidst the destruction...  Far better, surely, to find purpose helping us shape the new world of abundance that is now on the horizon.

Perhaps instead of feeling you have to say anything, consider the fact this might all be moving faster than you realised and enjoy the delights of spending 80% of your day learning and listening?
There are many here who sound like the naysayers that told us at the beginning Bitcoin would never work.  
If you want to see far, it's incumbent upon you to look at the world this technology is going to exist in tomorrow instead of thinking we've reached some kind of stasis.   
So, here's where it's going:
[China’s Midea Group household appliance giant files patent for Mining Bitcoin via appliances](
[Bitcoin mining lightbulb built at Blockchain summit] (
[Andreas Antonopolous - the end of mining centralisation] (
"...But now that we have arrived at the highest silicon fabrication density (at or below 16nm), the entire industry is bound by a much slower process, with 2x increase every 18 months at best. This new dynamic removes many of the incentives to centralization of mining." - Andreas
Obviously this is going to stir up a fair bit of cognitive dissonance for those people who would rather the status quo remain, so I understand why some find the inevitability of mining decentralisation so hard to accept.

You are absolutely 100% right.  This is exactly what is happening and this current bump along the lunar runway is just about bitcoin picking itself up and shaking off the latest round of parasites.  This has always been a slow game of gradually weening the old world off addiction to 'greed is good' whilst also ensuring the 'V for Vendetta' generation doesn't give all those old Gordon Geckos an enurism, ha!

This subreddit is ground zero for bitcoin outreach and the first place the journalists putting those stories together come for building up a more rounded picture of what's going on... It's also the first point of call for ordinary people who are looking for help and advice onboarding and getting a general overview of bitcoin as a whole.  Ultimately, childish nonsense like this leads to you harming the ecosystem, those working within it and, by extension, your own stake in bitcoin (if you have one).

Lovely ideas.
If we take away the monetary inventive for a moment... 
In terms of rewarding users for quality posts (photos/comments/links) Isn't this exactly what Reddit/Stackexchange already does?
There's a problem with Sybil attacks of course, which blockstack may suitably address in future.
Crux of the content 'problem' is figuring out how to reward the original creator of the work, not engineering a monetary incentive system for *more* (often duplicated) content, without attribution (be that photos, a youtube video or a JStor publication). 
Anyone who has done a reverse image search, or visited sites like knowyourmeme knows we already have all the information and tools on hand to create a truly fair way of fixing all this.  It's just that, prior to bitcoin, we didn't have a global, imuutable public ledger to properly timestamp those creations, which has left all our data beholden to data silo companies with conflicting interests.  In the respect, the project above resembles the same type of data ring fencing with blockchain thrown in as a buzzword because mySQL is no longer en vogue (even though SQL would do a far better job there).
**The Solution**
What does the world look like then when the original creator of a work (and those permisonlessly creating derivatives and sharing online)... are tagged through something like the ascribe.io platform, and Google image search can postumously reward creators and 'remixers' / publishers of the works?
If we couple with the idea blockstack will one day give users an imuutable trusted global identity (pseudonymous or otherwise), then Reddit/Google/Youtube rewarding publishers via their own sidechain and/or alt running through lightning network... and you begin to see how the creative commons can begin to bloom without the need for any other blockchains or intermediary data gatekeepers.
I love how we can trawl through history and begin rewarding long lost creators without rebuilding a platform from scratch.  This of course extends to music, helpful comments and even lolcat videos.
And the beauty is we *already* have the tools and APIs to make this a reality very, very quickly.
None of us have to reinvent the wheel from scratch here, we just need to give the supporting wheel arches a bit of a polish ;)

“You never change things by fighting the existing reality.  To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” – Buckminster Fuller
Fiat - like Bitcoin - is just a measurement tool we happen to call money.  It is what societies and individuals do *with* those measurement tools that matters.  
The 'propaganda' posted here in that sense goes against the cause of bitcoin since one of the things that can be done with that fiat is to cycle it into bitcoin.  Let us not forget bitcoin (as money) can equally be used for all of the things pointed to on the poster if we don't change hearts and minds.  We must avoid seeing this game as the 99% vs 1% since there is room in this space for EVERYONE.  Bitcoin isn't a special new little club of techno elitists.  Bitcoin is for (and requires) EVERYONE.
In the end, we are better to focus on the many many positive things happening by those invested in "bitcoin - the idea" and its propensity to do good.  Ultimately, we all just wanna' build rockets, flying cars, amazing things in VR and get to the *actual* moon and beyond.
If that sounds like a future you'd like to see; then we need all the good, kind Grandmas and Grandpapas, bankers and dilettantes to climb onboard the rocket ship with us...  Which requires us to stop perpetuating the myth that all the fiat they've worked so hard for all their lives is evil... when so much good has been done with it to evolve society to a point in time where something like bitcoin could even be a possibility.
TL;DR: If you want to see *real* change then instead of making negative art; consider making good art and [show the world as changeable](  It's time to put past mistakes behind us and realise this is now a wholesum game where everyone can thrive.
In the meantime, thanks for all your bitcoin support!

[ScienceMag — Why Criminals Can't Hide Behind Bitcoin](
{from the paper above}
When Bitcoin first emerged, law enforcement officers were “panicking,” Meiklejohn says. “They thought these technologies were dangerous and made it harder for them to do their job.” But as the arrests and convictions have rolled in, “there’s a steady shift toward seeing cryptocurrency as a tool for prosecuting crimes.” 
Even in the strange new world of Bitcoin, FBI Assistant General Counsel Brett Nigh said in September 2015, **“investigators can follow the money.”**
**The majority of Bitcoin users are law-abiding people** motivated by privacy concerns or just curiosity...The paradox of cryptocurrency is that its associated data create a forensic trail that can suddenly make your entire financial history public information.

The phrase also suggests the ability to "computer cross-dress" and represent oneself as a different gender, age, race, etc.*

There are much easier ways for monied people to get hold of bitcoin (ICO's are one :p).  
As such, this looks more like a bold business strategy given the hassle with money transfers that would normally cause friction in the realestate purchase process.  How cool that buying a house is now as easy as grabbing a new book on amazon!  That is the *real* story here.
Moreover, given their comments on wanting to attract brilliant people from the crypto community, they should be lauded for pushing for diversity in clientele, including "average Joes" who, through bitcoin, have attained a degree of social mobility hitherto out of reach.
The beauty of course, is that whatever the motivation behind this, that diversity is going to happen anyway.  The eventual blurring of lines between class and social status is good for both bitcoin and those in the 'old world' keen to bridge the divide and embrace this technology.
Incidentally, [BitPremier]( has been around for donkey's years doing this and certainly wasn't seen as a cynical attempt to dupe bitcoiners into parting with their holdings.
We'd do well to dispense with the sneering "us" vs. "them" attitude.  Either you see bitcoin as money (and therefore for everyone) or you see it as some kind of get rich scheme that would eventually lead to the creation of a new "1%" and the repetition of the same class elitism and greed that lead to the need for bitcoin in the first place.
As I see it, there's no longer a 99% vs 1%.  This rocket ship needs EVERYONE and has no room for elitism on either side of the 'divide'.

As we know, those that have been abused often become the biggest abusers themselves in later life (see [victim mentality](  One can understand why such painful experiences would lead a person to having a personal vendetta against a system that allowed those circumstances to unfurl.
Life is not about digits.  Our greatest memories: our first kiss, a perfect sunrise, a robin landing in your garden, laughter with genuine friends who love you for who you are - not what you have.  All those genuine moments that make us rejoice in the beauty of it all come for *free*.

I don't think anything I have written could be construed as FUD unless you have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.
Not sure how long you have been involved in bitcoin, but if you cast your mind back 2-3 years ago, you may remember that most of the points you make were bought up by the old world in MSM who attacked bitcoin for the environmental cost of mining.
The cost of fiat printing doesn't stop at the Federal Reserve, nor is global physical monetary production, supply, distribution and maintenance an American only affair.  There's the Royal Mint in the UK and myriad other treasuries and 'printing houses' maintaining that aging system.  Roll into that the cost of transportation, security, the sheer cost of counterfeiting and fraud (50% of all UK cash is unaccounted for and remains in the shadow economy).  It's not hard to see then, that the cost of maintaining physical cash far outweighs that of maintaining the bitcoin network.
But even the current bitcoin zeitgest is set to change with the cost of ASIC chips now making consumer adoption practical... Mining *will* almost certainly be decentralised at some juncture, and the code (which is all that matters) will adapt in the same way the internet protocol adapted from HTML &gt; HTML 5 and beyond.  There is no reason a proof of work change couldn't happen if the users themselves were behind it and it was being made for the good of the network as a whole.  We can envisage greenbit style nodes that are eco friendly, consumer driven devices, and mining centres that actually do something useful with all that computing power (think folding style nodes).  That's the beauty of bitcoin - it's just code that is constantly evolving to meet the needs of the ever-expanding ecosystem and, principally, the users of the system.
It is worth remembering that the original bitcoin vision was complete decentralisation: everything was to run through the client from exchanges to marketplaces like openbazaar.  It was only when Wikileaks announced bitcoin support and the team behind Satoshi fled (perhaps understandably) out of fear, that the ecosystem and those that believed in bitcoin as a tool to unite the entire human family carried on this grand project.  Thus the ecosystem had to evolve *very, very* differently.  
Andreas Antonopoulos made a great observation a few years back: even if the digital elliptic curve algorithm was one day cracked (an eventually that already has backup plans), then those invested in bitcoin - the idea, would get right back up the very next day and create Bitcoin2.  None of this is about hardware, business plans, profit margins or even bitcoin itself; it's about good, honest PEOPLE who have belief in each other and the interests of humanity as a whole as the glue that binds them together...  As such, it doesn't even matter (as a westerner) whether you're using bitcoin at this nascent stage or fiat as long as you are doing good things with those measurement tools that furthers the beautiful vision many of us have for the future.  None of what we want to achieve through total decentralisation is incongruent with businesses that have a strong moral foundation, governments, NGO's or institutions like the UN.
As Paul Graham (of Y-Combinator and Hacker News) points out; many of the most successful startups he has helped nurture (AirBnB etc.) didn't necessarily have the best ideas to begin with, but they did have great teams and people willing to learn, listen and adapt their visions.  That's all that matters with bitcoin in the end – which team has the most beautiful vision of the future, and are willing to put egos and their own selfish interests to the side to help bridge the gap between that old world and the new.
In the meantime, the beauty of all this is: neither you or I have to agree with that vision of a completely decentralised future.  Bitcoin is open source and those with different philosophies and ideas are free to go their own way.
For instance, those who want to keep mining centralisation just as it is, are free to do so.  Indeed, there's an entire group of lovely people with that vision that created their own version of bitcoin called BCH (Bitcoin Cash) over at r/btc which everyone is free to join and contribute to.
My interest in all of this?  
Well, I and many others in this space have seen Carl Sagan's 'Cosmos' so many times, I have seen that once we put our petty differences aside and focus on the much bigger picture that awaits us out there in the stars...  then those invested in bitcoin - the idea, and those most able to shape its destiny are doing so with much bigger goals in mind than simply monetary profit incentive... Once we see it as a technology capable of uniting the entire human family and getting us beyond the stars, childish little skirmishes borne of money, power, politics, fear and greed will fall to a bygone era that looked at the species in terms of tribes as opposed to one living organism that is capable of far more than simply 'surviving' the journey...   
In that sense, this is how I think of bitcoin (and computer science in general).

No, I didn't misread it at all.  Trump et al, may see this as one big game with pawns to move around, but there are those of us who care very deeply about humanity, have travelled very widely in this world and sat with people from all walks of life and we have been thinking very, very deeply about how alike we all are, and how computers hold the key to fixing everything.
There are those of us who actually look to the stars and dream of reaching them within our lifetimes and understand we can only do so, if we are all onboard the good ship humanity.
It all comes down to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams and etch into the very fabric of their being the concept of "non participation in anything you believe to be evil."
For me, Aaron, and many others who believe we are all the same and that "information will set us free", Carl Sagan's [Pale Blue Dot]( is a lot more than just a pretty bunch of words.

Lol.  Very impressive young human!
Now... are you aware that the word idiot, comes from the Greek Idiote and is actually a term used to describe those that chose not to specialise in one career?
Today we would call them polymaths or individuals.  Some of the greatest polymaths of the past were Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Buckminster Fuller.
Idiot is a word derived from the Greek ἰδιώτης, idiōtēs ("person lacking professional skill", "a private citizen", "individual"), from ἴδιος, idios ("private", "one's own").
Of course, Chris Morris predicted all this 10 years ago, in the seminal classic, Nathan Barely.  Here we can see the sketch where the character played by Julian Barrett laments the "Rise of the Idiots".
The Sandiwch of course is considered Britain's "biggest contribution to gastronomy" and came from Lord Sandwich who once had the genius idea of putting two slices of bread together for supper.

I find it more beneficial to everyone involved if we stick to empirical observations and avoid emotive arguments that create knee-jerk reactions (I mention later in my points above that this kind of 'fight of flight' was expected, but one that I believe we can all learn to get into the habit of transcending).
Bitcoin succeeds when we embrace the obvious truth that the more diversity in terms of age, gender, background, culture, race and social strata we have onboard this project, the stronger the ecosystem becomes through that diversity of cultural input and experience.  Since bitcoin touches everything on the globe, we need everyone onboard, including the 'white old men' who fulfilled the role of patriarchs in that old world.
It is those boards of companies in this space that lack this diversity in thinking and comprise *only* white men, with largely non-technical and/or finance backgrounds, who still see a need for patriarchal control we need to be wary of... since they don't have either the technical or scientific background required, nor the social and emotional-intelligence intuitively understood by those who are well travelled and/or grew up with a wide plethora of cultural inputs from the borderless internet itself.
It all comes back to the illusion of control in the end:
I wanted to avoid singling people and organisations out here (none of these people are 'evil') but let's just look at the two mindsets of the people and companies in this space:
*"Give me control of a nation's money; and I care not who makes its laws."* — Money Lenders of the Old World
You will notice that famous [quote that sees money as a system of control]( screams out from the very [top of the blog]( of one of the chief proponents (and loudest voices) of S2X and that he himself sits as chief of the board of his latest venture leading a team that comprises [entirely of white male businessmen (and a few white male developers)](
 vs. *"Information (and money as information) wants to be free."* — Technology Activists of the New World
Contrast that with the [teams working for companies]( who have been most vocal on the other side of the debate, and you will see lots of people (male and female) from all kinds of diverse backgrounds, cultures and disciplines that begin to look more like the kinds of teams you would expect to be working on global-scale science projects like the Large Hadron Collider.  Because, well, *that's exactly what bitcoin is* - it's the largest socio-economic *science* project in mankind's history.
These are *empirical observations* I am giving you here, *not* a narrative spun up designed to point blame at any particular demographic.  
I raise these issues so that we can avoid repeating mistakes of the past and ensure we strengthen an ecosystem that can never fall foul to [the tragedy of the commons]( 
The conclusions, I will leave you to draw for yourself, since it is not for me to tell you what to think and feel and I leave you with this maxim: bitcoin is for everybody that understands bitcoin is for everybody.

It's like asking a post office worker in 1996, what they think this new up and coming thing called email is going to do...
Spend 2 months in r/bitcoin and you will likely have more domain knowledge than any 'analysts' or 'experts' you will hear from in the old world (with the exception of a few who have been closely covering it from the beginning).
Think for yourselves, and please reconsider posting these ridiculous predictions pulled out of people's arses, it makes us look like we have no idea what bitcoin is about.

The moment musicians, artists, movie directors and ordinary people started sewing the bitcoin meme into the fabric of day to day reality, was the moment bitcoin 'made it' as the defacto new world currency of choice.
Whilst many have missed the importance of people like Louis CK accepting bitcoin, TV shows like the Good Wife, CSI, the Simpsons, Mr. Robot and Ben 10 embedding bitcoin imagery in their works of art, those who were here in the 80's understand that all this has happened before and humanity has already "backed" bitcoin in all its messy, chaotic anti-fragility.  
If we computer scientists could go back in time would we rebuild the http protocol?  We sure would, because all those various threads that hold the internet together are far from perfect.
Young companies and individuals vested in this space, must do their very best to learn from that early internet history; and in doing so help us all avoid mistakes borne of fear and greed that lead to things like the 'browser wars'.  That means embracing collaboration over competition, which is something I see time and time again happening in this space.
We get there by remembering this is what bitcoin is really about:

Just to counter all the FUD flying around about this story:
Jamie's statement suggesting Bitcoin wasn't legalised in Japan, is false.
See: [Japan is set to begin recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting tomorrow](  [Vietnam]( and myriad other governments have also made moves to recognise BTC as a formal payment method.
As for Jamies other comments:
The wonderful Nick Colas from Convergex Group tackled pretty much every point Jamie raised wayyy back in 2013 on Bloomberg.
[Video Link - On Bitcoin's Legitimacy](
*"If you are a U.S. buyer of bitcoin your institution is regulated by U.S. law, so there is not total anonymity...80% of US Dollar bills go outside the U.S. and how many times do you see news of a drug bust where there are stacks and stacks of hundred dollar bills?  The fact that a currency is used for illicit activity doesn't make it immoral or illegitimate... " — Nick Colas*
As for Jamie's knee-jerk (borderline xenophobic) comments on bitcoin being used in places like Venezuela, here's an explanation from Chamath Palihapitiya in 2013 who talks about bitcoin being used in this context as a proactive way to *solve* problems ordinary people are facing in those countries.
[Video Link - Bitcoin [is] a Huge, Huge, Huge Deal!](
*"I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fun, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. Because what you're talking about right now is, for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right? The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government. It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina. Everywhere you have currency pressure. Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. And then, after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism." 
— Chamath Palihapitiya*
The payment mechanism part Chamath alluded to is just about to happen thanks to Layer 2 technology augmenting the base bitcoin blockchain protocol (as [explained here]( by Andreas).

BitPay and Jeff have been good for this space in the past and that shouldn't be forgotten... Before calling for any kind of mass BitPay boycott, perhaps giving Jeff a chance to see the damage he's been doing first is more conducive to him coming to his senses and dropping 2X; as opposed to poking him into a constant state of fight of flight.
After all, November is roughly 7 years away in BST (Bitcoin Space Time)...  There are only so many carefully thought out scientific, commonsense arguments you can refute until cognitive dissonance eventually gives way to realisation :p
In years to come, we can all hug it out and laugh about the many idiotic things Jeff (and indeed all of us) have done in this space out of our love for this technology.

What I think is more useful is looking at the subscriber growth rate.  We're now seeing posts on r/bitcoin getting into r/all on a regular basis and anything up to 2000 people joining each day.  Given the subscriber count was only about 10,000 some three years ago and it's already at 355,000 (up 5k in 2 days I think) this gives us an indication of why things are going to happen much faster than we realise.

Note how the original bitcoin companies in this space who took the biggest risks at the beginning (mining pools, wallet providers) all have come out in unequivocal support of core regardless of hashrate, because they believe in the *people* and the integrity of the (some 200 scientists and engineers) who have been diligently maintaining the code and ensuring bitcoin remains the securest blockchain on the planet.
This is about SCIENCE not BUSINESS.  There's a reason the power company and investors who helped build the Large Hadron Collider aren't pressing the big red buttons on the consoles.  
Of course, Core's ultimate big red button is to simply change the proof of work algo which will effectively brick all that mining equipment and allow those scientists and engineers interested in using bitcoin - the technology to move us to a world of abundance, unencumbered.  This will happen regardless of whether shapeshift gets onboard or becomes the myspace of bitcoin.  As sure as the internet moving forward wasn't reliant on any of the vested interests of AOL Online board members.
Litecoin is also another Plan B option, should those scientists go that route.
Businessmen interested only in short term profits and shortsighted visions of where the future of all this is heading, will have no power here, hashrate or cognitive.
Get onboard the rocket ship Erik and please stop hurting bitcoin, we all adore you when you're at your best and we all want to see shapeshift and the myriad other ideas you could be working on, thriving in this new world.

Roger, like so many in America, has been abused (as evidenced by the tears he has shed on camera about those innocents killed in Iraq during Operation: Shock and Awe).  It is a system predicated upon a document that can never change; no matter how much that society wants to change, that sold capitalism to the world based on a misinterpretation of Adam Smith's actual work...  
And we know that those who have been abused often become the biggest abusers themselves later in life.
And yet, America and her people in all its crazy coke-fuelled, neon bible glitz is one of the most incredible countries on the planet for their sheer belief in one another and their will to make the impossible possible.  The vast majority are good, kind, honest, hard-working people like *every* other populace on the globe.  
Roger can be lauded for being one of the anomalies within that system that broke out and carried many important ideas borne from the idea that 'information wants to be free'.  But somewhere along the journey, as he gained more and more power and public prominence, he himself became part of a new ideological elite that went to war on everybody within the old system, including those good people (of all political stripes) who work in the light to hold the old system together.
There is no black or white or room for "my idealogical views are better than your idealogical views" in a world that truly wants the WHOLE of humanity to be freed from 'leaders' who are no better or wiser than you or I.  It is incumbent therefore for each of us to simply ask "how can I make the world a better place?" and carry out as many random acts of kindness in their day to day lives as possible.  This includes refraining from releasing a toxic tweet into the ether when you could instead be saying something that makes people look to the future with optimism and belief in a better world.
Roger's whole 'attack' on Bernie Sanders where he sought as 'the owner of bitcoin.com' to donate money to a charity if Bernie debated him (and his idealogical political views) simply mimicked the tactics of those in 'power' who equate money with wealth and who love to argue and 'debate' and put others and their ideas down, instead of discussing gently and being OK with not having all the answers.  Thus, we witness the corruption that comes with power and influence and money... 
BTC and the implications of Layer 2 tech, has the capacity to end all this and finally unite the 99.9% of the population of this planet who *are* good, honest people with the 0.1% who are just the same but were as out of ideas as to how to fix things as everyone else was.  But that union can't happen if one newly empowered group thinks their vision is better than anyone elses.
America is a slow and cumbersome beast; it has laws that long ago should have been updated (why must a President resign after 8 years if he or she is still the best and most qualified to do the job?  Why do we accept a 2-tier justice system? Why is universal healthcare frowned upon when so many other countries have achieved it?).
And yet America, like Europe, will be just fine - the denizens of the borderless internet decides things now; and we always work it out in the end because of that self-preservation we all have within us, and the few good men and women who always make a stand in our darkest hours.  In the end, the truth finds its way through the cracks.
Roger and others would do well to go back to school and learn the history of the internet, those that shaped it, and those that put their lives on the line for that beautiful simple idea: "information wants to be free."
And the moment bitcoin became money as information everything changed, just as email changed everything before that.
The bitcoin that prevails will be that which is most free, it has no room for monied bitcoin elitists with a political agenda; it is loyal only to the crowd that wants to use it and the scientists, engineers, politicians, investors, inventors and humanitarians who are excited about how it has the potential to truly unite the species as one.  
Bitcoin gets that right, and this technology has the potential to be the rocket fuel that enables us to answer that question common to all humanity "Are we alone in the universe?"

Roger's views are no longer (and never were) any kind of threat to bitcoin technological progress; we'd all do well to move on from those silly old disputes and recongise that the technology is going to march on (Lightning network, Rootstock, Blockstack) regardless of what old bitcoin incumbents (who have barely even understood what those new upgrades entail) have to say about where it is at this moment in time. 
Remember Roger is not a computer scientist or an engineer, so you might want to attach his technical arguments the same amount of weight we attributed Warren Buffet and the like back in the very early bitcoin days.
Besides, Roger's got his own coin now right?  So... not sure why he isn't focussing all his attention on helping to guide that toward whatever his utopian big block crypto vision happens to be...

Jamie seems like a good guy (when it comes to how he treats his staff), but I do hope he comes to realise that governments aren't beholden to his views or the views of economists; society evolved to where we are today through governments embracing innovation and new ways of solving big societal problems.  There is nothing about bitcoin - the technology that can't enhance the role of government and free it from the yoke of unsound money created out of thin air by commercial banks.
There's an incredible debate in the UK Parliament that covers this, which was tabled by Steve Baker to discuss exactly how bitcoin may prove to be the breakthrough technology that will return us to a society based around the creation of sound money.
"**Bitcoin shows us that peer2peer, non-state money, is practical and effective...** I've used it... It was easier to use than a credit card... **It is becoming possible for people to move away from state money.**  So I would like to see every obstacle to the creation of alternative currencies (within the ordinary commercial law) removed... We must not fall into the trap that the United States has fallen into of obstructing innovation..."

We'll have to see how it all pans out as the industry, and our ability to build process models for dealing with things like this through consensus, matures.  
If all the exchanges decide B2X and BTC are two separate entities and bitcoin.com is selling B2X intentionally mislabelled as BTC then customers would have a right to say they were knowingly mis-sold and would be able (at least in the UK) to go seek advice from [consumer protection services](  
If it's just the bitcoin.com ticker showing price we're talking about, then it hardly even matters - it will just look like bitcoin.com has a technical glitch to most casual users.  
All these silly mind games are just further cementing how little they all understand about what bitcoin actually is capable of doing when we get this right.  
We should not be surprised by this: they're not computer scientists, and are really trying to influence the arc of a technology they only have a basic kindergarten level technical grasp of.  Further, everyone working on bitcoin.com and related business endeavours (on the technical side) has to be paid to be there.  
Think about that for a minute.
What many don't realise is that the real experiment at the heart of all this is whether something like bitcoin can work without any top-down hierarchy or 'leaders' that speak for the entire group...  We are trying to show here that people can make better decisions via consensus and the wisdom of well informed crowds. 
Each wave of attacks leads to better tools being built to answer those questions... So we might consider all this an early test run for what liquid democracies of the future might look on a global scale, where we each get a say over governance, without any emperors or gatekeepers making poor decisions behind closed doors that the group as a collective haven't agreed upon.
As for bitcoin.com and this latest test - I am quite sure the passing of greed and ignorance will come soon enough, as those working dark magic from that old [demon haunted world]( find themselves heavily outnumbered by those working 7 steps ahead in the light.

Hmmm, kinda' reminds me of when I was a teen and would go to the Snooker club full of pro players, and we'd ask for the one set of pool balls to play pool instead.  Cue lots of derisory snorts from Snooker-evangelists who thought we were committing sacrilege.  
Still, they could see we were good kids and, after a number of months, we'd join in the occasional game of Snooker with them, and eventually saw merit in their slow old timer sport, and they learnt a few pool tricks from us that they could apply to their Snooker games :)
I guess the key to the club maintaining order was only having one set of pool balls to the 22 snooker ball sets ;)

Gen-Z are those born at the turn of the century and just now entering the work place; millennials came of age at the turn of the century.  See article I linked for most widely accepted definitions. 
The yuppies you are talking about lie in a crossover period where Gen-X were growing up and had just taken to this new thing called home computers.  These 'nerds' were widely ostracized by those that thrived in the coke fueled hedonism of high finance.  
It wasn't until Google and Zuckerberg et al came along that the Oxford English dictionary definition of 'nerd' / 'geek' changed from having negative connotations to something more aspirational, and people began to look up to those 'nerds' as people that were incredibly knowledgeable in certain areas and worthy of emulation.

Yeah exactly, same reason you won't shout "Nigger" at someone down the street (even though in the past it was perfectly acceptable).  Since we know it is going to offend some people, we choose, as a society, to refrain from causing offence.  Doesn't mean you can't use that language with your best black friends who know you're not racist and just trying to fit in with their culture, but infront of a stranger?  It's a no-no.  
We know that racism, sexism and all that bullshit old skool patriarchal thinking has to go, we know there's no real difference between girls and boys brains, we know that the best conversations we have are when we put lust and base instincts behind us, look deeply into the eyes of the other person and truly get inside their heads... so as good citizens of the internet representing bitcoin, if we want to build the world in that kind of image, we ought think about being inclusive and ensuring everyone is afforded the same kind of courtesy we'd expect ourselves.
You want more women in this space to have those deep and meaningful conversations with?  Make it a place where they feel equal and appreciated for who they are and what they carry inside, not what they look like.

In my experience, there are two modes of thinking here: cypherpunks and their followers who exist in a world of secrecy and a copious amount of paranoia (built up as a result of the things they've had to do in the past to enable civilian level cryptography, mixed with their deep understanding of the broken systems that currently holds our data together)... and there are those computer scientists who see a world where the crowd is rapidly electing to drop the need for secrets and privacy because of the increased social capital and reach they enjoy through networks that encourage collaboration and openness (like facebook, twitter, github).
In the wake of the Equifax data breach, it is clear there needs to be another step before those two worlds can work together in tandem, which I would see lies with something like Blockstack / Rootstock allowing the crowd to migrate their data from centralised platforms and gatekeepers so that we can ensure the integrity of personal data.
This leads to things like a global digital passport (for use on and offline) linked to social karma capital similar to what we see on reddit, and various levels of encrypted data layers giving those we trust access to things like medical records and financial data.
As the above system evolves this leads to a level of transparency on the individual, corporate and government record keeping level that means we are all incentivized to play fairly with one another.
We must also think about how things such as forced economic migration is set to be disrupted by all this when the 70% of the world (some 3-4 billion) without access to the internet or global economy, suddenly skip all the intermediaries and have access to all of the above with nothing but a $20 smartphone.  We can imagine some kind of global kickstarteresque / openbazaar like programme that enables Westerners to push economic energy into entire third world countries (and reaping the benefits of trade) without needing to ask permission from a single gatekeeper anywhere in the economic chain.
TL;DR: A bit of both is necessary at this stage, but one would envisage long term, the 99.9% of good actors that make up the bulk of humanity would elect for total transparency in all affairs (albeit via various tiers of encrypted data layers) meaning that 0.1% who would choose to hide in the shadows have nothing to gain by trying to cheat the system.

It's a lot more complicated than that.  Think of Barry as more of a classic VC that has hedged his bets in all this and invested in loads of companies in the space, even those with different visions of where Bitcoin should go, in the hope some of his 'bets' will eventually pay off.
Further, just because companies have received investment from DCG does not mean they are contractually obliged to follow any visions DCG have in balancing the different needs of those companies with regard to their input over the bitcoin protocol.  
Case-in-point: both Ben Davenport and Adam Back (Bitgo and Blockstream respectively) have come out massively against 2X. 
My biggest concern with DCG are with companies they've *acquired* as opposed to invested in.  
Specifically coindesk, given that they have the ability to lead the narrative by virtue of being a publisher.  But even coindesk are set to be disrupted (as are all media properties of the future) via crowd-led news outlets like Wikitribune and, of course, by Reddit itself via the scrutiny of the crowd.
Not a lot can be done behind closed doors in this space without there being a leak somewhere, since so much of the *real* work *has to happen* in the open (IRC, mailing lists, BIP's etc.).
If you want to join the dots, I would say look to the actual companies in this space and the kind of friends they have (and belief structures those friends subscribe to).
If Nathaniel Popper's account is correct, then there's an interesting group of people here that met and discussed bitcoin a number of years ago, which perhaps explains why companies like Xapo are pro-segwit 2x.
In particular, pay close attention to those in this space who are of the "Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes its laws" persuasion. A lot of this comes down to ideology, ignorance of the open vision of this technology, and a 'business as usual' attitude.  
And, worse still, a failure of newly endowed businessmen and women who have never built anything on the internet before who have no idea about the mistakes made by corporations of the past who tried to take control of the world wide web in the exact same way they are.
The difference this time around is those who did make those mistakes during the world wide web revolution, and fought for net neutrality so you might enjoy sites like Reddit, are now all grown up.  A lot of the people involved in bitcoin from the beginning have been running successful internet startups for the last few decades, and are slowly figuring out how all this can fit around what they've already built.
Bear in mind **it's possible for these two competing visions to exist side by side**; there is no reason 2X and coinbase et al couldn't provide a nice little safe Paypal 2.0 esque walled garden akin to Apple's App Store in the interim... just as right now Paypal and Bitcoin are co-existing nicely (Stripe, Braintree for instance).  
It's imperative both 'sides' stay calm and don't threaten each others different visions by doing **egregious stuff like forcing a contentious hard fork that doesn't offer strong replay protection**, or **mixing up tickers which will confuse ordinary everyday people** which we all have a duty of care to look after.  Clearly 2X can attract the more cautious institutional investor side and "App Store" grannies, whilst 1X can be the big, bold "Android" innovator with crazy visions of space stations and decentralised mining which the more tech savvy and younger generations can get involved with without needing to be wet nursed.  
Atomic swaps mean those grannies and their grandkids can still interact regardless of which side of the fork either party bought into.  So the future is bright for both 'sides' if **B2X do the right thing and make sure they do a responsible fork we can all get behind and champion.**  
Failure to do so will end up riling up both 'sides' continuously and open us all up to silly DAO style hacks as each 'side' gets prodded (instead of constantly peer-reviewed), which only makes alts like ethereum more attractive for people entering this space and further sets back innovation.  Better we all look after each other and focus on the security and future of both blockchains (and yes, the future of DCG companies building cool stuff on them).  
**We all need to take a step back and recognise the more important role we are all playing here in helping solve much bigger socio-economic issues like the environment, war and poverty.**  Everyone in this space gets to create solutions for tackling those problems in really exciting ways through this technology when it's ready, but only if we're all playing nicely with one another and pushing our energy in the same direction.  We all want to create a better world for future generations, we all want to be proud that we played a positive role in helping shape that world was at a time in history when the masses were crying out for people to step up.  Time then, to start building (and mending) bridges and focus on those much bigger socio-economic objectives we can all agree on, no matter what side of the fork we stand on.
Don't forget too, there's been zero announcements from Y-Combinator, Google, Facebook, Reddit or any of the websites that most shape the internet landscape... so, in the long-run, DCG and all the companies they have in their portfolio (and the tiny userbase they all command in comparison) have little say in where all this ultimately leads... It takes just one announcement from Google to say they've integrated Layer two ready 1X bitcoin into Android pay and Gmail to completely change the rules of the game... 
It's perhaps up to DCG companies then to think about pivoting away from their focus on commission and payment gateways since the current internet giants surely already have Layer 2 solutions up their sleeves (Blockstack alone changes everything in terms of decentralised identity and data storage - which is another Barry Silbert portfolio investment btw).
I'll leave you with Facebook executive Chamath, talking about bitcoin back in 2013... A guy who, I believe - along with many in silicon valley - actually *gets* bitcoin, why it was invented and where this open source technology is truly heading if we move our attention away from 1st world coffee problems and this in-fighting finally draws to a close in November...

To get behind those technologies requires Erik et al to rip up their old middleman business plans and imagine a new tomorrow.  Which requires stepping away from the ['illusion of control.'](
So, just as it's hard for Dimon et al to imagine the new world of bitcoin, it's also hard for Erik - who is emotionally and fiscally tied to bitcoin being fettered by centralised miners and middleware like shaepshift and bitpay taking commissions - to imagine stuff like Zap, Atomic Swaps and a world where mining chips in consumer devices, decentralised exchanges and decentralised marketplaces like OpenBazaar lead to everything those bitcoin empires were built on being rendered obsolete.
Doesn't mean Erik is a bad guy, just that he's perhaps lacking imagination in how best to pivot the amazing stuff he's built in this space, to accommodate the new unfolding reality and opportunities that exist therein. 
At the end of the day, it will be those solutions that best serve users that end up 'winning' and we are yet to hear what Google, Y-Combinator and others will get behind (although Microsoft and their billion users have already pledged support to Core, Paul Graham has already tweeted his love for bitcoin over ethereum, so we have a fair idea what Silicon Valley are already thinking...)
It's all about code and the imagination of the teams behind that code in the end.  
In the meantime, we can all enjoy the journey when we come to the understanding none of this is a fight, and we'll all one day end up hugging it out as we stare down from outer space, at that pale blue dot bitcoin helped save.  Erik - and everyone else - will get to say they played a small but non-trivial role in helping us all get there... together ;)

This approach risks looking like a cynical marketing trick (not saying that's what it is).
Rather than trying to buy exposure and using charities as leverage to pull on the heart strings of people, perhaps think how your project might gain exposure organically through the contribution of thoughtful ideas and initiatives that proactively engage the community.

Your points break down when multiple people and organisations with different backgrounds, ideas and values find benefit in using the same *technology* and/or shared resource.
You are simply describing the conditions and rules that are agreed upon amongst those groups *using* the technology.
Hence in some countries that suffer from bush fires, the *technology* of fire is tightly controlled, whereas in others a simple campfire is a basic human need that every citizen requires unfettered access to in order to survive.
Fire itself, of course, is agnostic to the pretensions of humans, or rules those groups of humans 'governing' its use have consented to... Fire will obediently follow the first law of thermodynamics, as it has since the dawn of time.
Just as the *technology* of bitcoin will stubbornly follow the laws of mathematics, and faithfully ignore any idealogically driven group insisting  1+1 should equal 3.
There are those that will come with buckets of gasoline, whilst others will counter with buckets of water, but no amount of screaming at Pandora to go back in her box will change the fact that a long, long time ago, some distant African relatives of ours rubbed two sticks together and lead humanity out of the darkness to where we are today.

Thanks for the info.
Physical cash, dodgy shell companies and fraudulent legal shenanigans in the old world are still the biggest problems facing central banks and governments.  China has the most advanced P2P digital money system in the world (wepay) and would be a cinch to integrate with bitcoin which is infinitely more traceable than the legacy fiat systems wepay is currently hooked into.  
Given they are the ones producing all the hardware and Chinese consumer giants like midea are looking to embed bitcoin mining chips in domestic appliances, I think we'd do well to give the Chinese a little more respect on the tech front.  And when AliBaba integrate bitcoin the entire planet changes overnight.  
In the meantime I would expect Bobby Lee and his little bro Charlie to help guide regulators into creating a more consumer friendly exchange environment out there.  
As with Spotify and all the amazing things nerds have achieved in the past in challenging old world thinking, we must not underestimate the ability of those who believe in the beauty of their crazy ideas enough to change the world. 
Just my humble thoughts on how this crazy chess game may play out, I've no more insight into the future than anyone else.

Not yet (though I downloaded the early release awhile back to briefly look at the tech, and I follow their updates and dev blog)...  
I'm too busy working on my own projects in this space which involves figuring out how we convert existing web 2.0 infrastructure into web 3.0.  We feel like we're back at the beginning of the internet again in that respect and my head is buzzing with so many ideas and possibilities, it's been difficult forming a coherent strategy, especially when so much is evolving in this space at lightning pace, and when so much time is also having to be spent firefighting non-techies from the business world (who I feel have missed the freakin' point of all this).
I think both OpenBazaar and Brave browser (in terms of how future websites and micro-payments will be funded through crowd-based micropayments) give us an early glimpse of what things to come might look.  I think we'll also see the complete decentralisation of advertising and ad networks (not even sure if ads are going to be needed in this brave new internet future).  Apple's latest update blocking advertiser cookies tells me the entire tech world is now forming a pincer movement in this direction, so perhaps all us old greying techies have all had the same epiphany at the same time.
From an adoption perspective, UX issues and the breaking of existing user / webmaster convention is gonna' take some time to change.  Which is fine, there's no rush to any of this.  We can't just smash the doors dow -, many jobs rely on those old world models...  So no matter how eager some people are to make all this happen tomorrow, it all needs to be done with grace and finesse.
Main thing (from a techy perspective) is we all have fun, avoid being distracted by short-term gains, don't stamp our feet if things go in a direction we're not happy with and, in doing so, stay focused on the bigger picture of what bitcoin and economic-energy-as-information means for the world (and especially those 4 billion people not yet connected to the global economy).

This incredible piece of art certainly shows the dark side of where this could have gone; but for every dark side, there is also a light side.  
[Fork The Banks - Let There Be Light](
Which resulted in [30 London galleries embracing bitcoin]( and Bitcoin being the main centrepiece at London's second biggest art fair back in 2015...  
[Here is the 30ft wall]( that was built for the show, featuring a plethora of artists work, and a statue of a young Shephard Fairey painting images of hope ("Ƀelieve") on a wall with integrated bitcoin ATM...  Many tens of thousands of people were first introduced to bitcoin through these artists' gargantuan efforts.
Note that the video uses Max Richter (as does Dark Wallet) and ends with the same spinning globe, but instead of the words "Let there Be Dark" it reads "Let there Be Light", the theme being "The Renaissance is Now". 
I feel both 'possible futures' needed to be communicated if we were to be able to "keep our heads" during all the disruption.

You're both right I think.  But is more righter :p In that ultimately it all comes down to belief and strength in the community that believes in the idea.  It's all about memes in the end, and how much people pass on the idea and are in love with it.  In that sense, the moment artists began promoting bitcoin in everything from hollywood movies and TV shows to pop songs and art galleries, the meme victory was 'won'.
Ordinary people love bitcoin, and just like you put up with and make concessions for the idiosyncrasies of an actual loved one, same will be true for bitcoin acolytes.  
People get too caught up in the tech, forgetting the average person cares not about what lies under the hood of their car bonnet as long as the car gets them from A &gt; B.
A case-in-point would be the boyfriend of a mate of mine who had built a compression algorithm twice as efficient as .mp3, at a time when mp3s were basically everywhere.  No matter how much he was told no-one cared that about mp3s being double the size of his format, he wouldn't listen because all he could see was the technology, as opposed to the people using it.  He wasted something like 6 years staring at a freakin' algorithm that no-one wanted and was massively depressed because no-one cared why his technology was better.  Because it *wasn't* better - it would have cost far more energy to convert everything in iTunes and personal MP3 libraries to a new format than to simply upgrade physical hard drive space and accept the clunkier older format did a fine job of getting music from A &gt; B.
Betamax Vs. VHS another good example (Betamax was superior, yet VHS was the thing the masses ended up going with).  Same with Edison vs. Tesla with AC vs. DC current.
See [War of Currents]( and [Format Wars](
The alt space / ethereum thing going on right now is no less a format war.
What is beautiful though, is that with atomic swaps, ultimately there needs to be no 'winner' and it opens up the possibility for all kinds of alt currencies with different properties being used everywhere bitcoin is accepted.  It will come down more to the communities adopting these alts running over LN / Bitcoin than the tech behind them which no-one will care about (think small towns, software companies, people all rallying around their local village / company coin).

I can't believe someone who thinks the status quo will remain forever is in this subreddit.  You sound like Watson (head of IBM back in 1940) when he said "the world will never need more than 5 computers".


Quite right he got to be richest man on Earth because he built code that mattered... Once... and just happened to be in the right time at the right place.  And this new world isn't about how much money individuals have any more, that system of wealth measurement broke a long time ago.  In this new world unfolding, true 'billionaires' will be those that can positively impact the lives of a billion people.
Microsoft long ago lost the race to linux and open source.  Why?  Because the only way of maintaining that code (and ailing business models charging for that code) was to pay people who didn't want to be there to write it.  Which is why so much NT Windows infrastructure is now at risk from breaches and why people who maintain open source repositories without fixed working hours, can foster huge support networks for projects that are maintained by those in love with their art... There is something to be said for simply seeing beautiful ideas come to life and make a positive impact in the world.  Code, after all, is no less an artform than any other (why do we paint?  write?  make music?  if not to principally speak to the world and leave an imprint in time).
Open source is already eating everything, including the O/S market.  And especially old decaying Windows systems (as we saw with the NHS ransomware attack a few months back that has now forced Microsoft to start rolling out patches on XP at great expense).
Code, is the only thing that has ever mattered in this game.  But maybe you had to be there right from the beginning (before the internet arrived) to understand what we actually mean by that, since back then the artform itself hadn't been tainted by business or money; everything we built in those early days was for the love of the creation itself.

Mike's one of the good ones who wanted to be commander-in-chief, partly because he was so visionary, partly because he lacked the nurturing skills needed to properly lead a bunch of ragtags and misfits still learning about the world...  
Unfortunately, what he didn't understand was that no matter how fast he wanted the world to change, it would only happen if he ceded control and allowed others the time to catch up to the future he was living in and for them to make a bunch of mistakes along the way.  In short, he forgot to enjoy the journey, so focused was he on the destination.
He did us all a favour in leaving, putting a rocket up everyone's arse, and then going on to hold the hands of the banks who were, at the time, terrified of what bitcoin meant for the world.  It lulled all those who meant to harm bitcoin into a false sense of security and schadenfreude, whilst core got to regroup and refocus taking onboard Mike's criticisms and addressing them over time.  Perhaps, it was Mike's plan all along. 
Regardless, I am quite sure, he will one day return with a big smile on his face, and find his place in the new ecosystem, perhaps running a sidechain with his many friends inside Google.

So when he is talking about the price of bitcoin being $3k+ does that mean he's now stepped down from his ludicrous "BCH is the real bitcoin" stance of a few months ago?
Since Mcafee has a vested interest in the mining and monetary aspect of all this, and chops and changes his views on everything, it's probably wise to take everything else that comes out of his mouth with a pinch of salt (especially as there's absolutely ZERO statistical evidence he's provided to back up his latest claims on monero vs. bitcoin).
Mcafee's only been involved in bitcoin a few years (if that)... seriously, what has he *actually* contributed to the BTC space?  What has he done or said that hasn't been about enriching Mcafee and co. somewhere down the line?  
If you're going to listen to the opinions of anyone, perhaps they should be the unbiased views of the many scientists and engineers that have been here since the beginning, who are beholden to ZERO business interests and whose views and experiences can be backed up by an online record showing years of selfless contributions (via github / essaying and public outreach) and who will provide you with actual evidence supporting their reasoning.
Then form your own opinions based on that evidence, but for God's sake, don't let some false emperor spouting nonsense on the *very* mainstream media you on one hand deplore for lying to the world, but will happily pull out when it props up the group narrative (even when there's no evidence to support the claims).

This is the crux of the issue, you all signed deals with the devil in search of fast, easy gains instead of learning the more deep socio-economic problems bitcoin was built to solve.  Now those who languish in the demon haunted world want their pound of flesh back.
You are working for unimaginative businessmen who made all their money from bitcoin gambling sites like SatoshiDice that prey on people's addictions and weaknesses and who are now pushing Loan companies like [Salt Lending]( doing exactly the same thing... but higher up the 'food chain'.  
Ultimately, these are ideas and businesses that will do nothing but further enslave humanity... increasing [the disparity of wealth]( and the very debt based slavery bitcoin was built to get countries and people out of.
[There are better, more principled ways]( of paying the salaries that don't require selling your soul for breadcrumbs tossed down to you by 'captains of industry'.  
It begins by asking ["Why does my company exist?"]( then finding a good and noble reason to get up in the morning and inspiring your team with the certainty you are making the world a better place.
Google called this philosophy "Don't Be Evil", Adam Back and others call the network being built around it ["Can't Be Evil".](
In the end, it's up for you to ask yourself "which side will I be on?" when that old world of debt slavery and control crumbles.  
Which means stepping up and making a stand NOW instead of rolling over for those breadcrumbs these new crypto emperors with no clothes are tossing you as they try to walk all over you, your ethics and everything the people who built bitcoin stand for.
I wish you the best of luck on your journey.

I'm not sure you could describe it as a 'sales pitch' per se.
As far as I understand it, most Angel investors getting onboard were well aware that they were investing in an entirely new type of company that had, at its very foundation, a new type of corporate philosophy, much as Google did, which lead to companies and web dev teams like the one I am part of completely redefining the way they did business.  
It's this philosophy of "Don't Be Evil" that lead to Loreal and companies like Coca Cola, and McDonald's investing in companies with a strong ethical focus enshrined in their code of conduct (in this case Loreal bought the Bodyshop, Coca Cola bought Innocent smoothies, and McDonald's were non-controlling stakeholders in ethical Coffee chain Pret a Manger).
Just because investors get onboard does not mean they have any control over what the company does.  There's a lot of weird knee-jerk reactions people have when they hear about big names like AXA and Loreal and assume they must be 'evil'.  I remember people being pissed when Anita Roddick sold the Bodyshop to Loreal, assuming she'd "sold out".  When asked why she did it she said something like: "To teach them 'Don't Be Evil', that you can make money and succeed as a business without exploiting others."
And that's what all this comes down to.  Yes you can make money out of bitcoin, as long as you understand you can't use the bitcoin protocol to exploit others, which is why governance of the bitcoin protocol *has* to be resistant to *any* company that seeks control of it or the developers.  
Blockstream have no more control over it than you or I do — if their ideas do not pass scientific peer-review (and consensus) of the 200+ scientists involved in the project then they are not adopted, simple as that.  
All of that can be checked through those transparent channels (irc, dev mailing list, github).
As for Blockstream having employees involved in protocol development?  If they had anything to hide they wouldn't even make that known would they?
There are many devs who work for companies that do protocol dev in their spare time, same happened on Linux dev.  
More worrying would be if protocol development went to B2X, where Jeff (who owns BitPay) would be the *sole* maintainer of the code requiring no peer-review (indeed code he's recently submitted to B2X has already been retracted for being insecure - bugs spotted by Core - not Jeff).  And what's BitPay's corporate philosophy?  What did their VC pitch deck look like?  Do they even have a corporate philosophy or code of conduct we can review?  And what have they done to enhance Layer 2 tech? 
So, yeah I'm good with Blockstream until they prove otherwise.  They appear to have a strong moral compass enshrined in its code of conduct, they understand bitcoin inside out (Adam was the inventor of Hashcash - one of the few whitepapers cited in the original Bitcoin whitepaper - without hashcash the Bitcoin proof-of-work algorithm wouldn't exist) and they're one of the few companies that have done exciting stuff outside of the boring Layer 1 exchange/debit card/payment gateway space.  Like Satellites in space, something bitcoiners like Jeff only dreamt of in our wildest imaginations just a few short years ago. 
And if they were to screw up?  Well, they would be asked to leave by the 200+ scientists who require them, like everyone else in the space, to "Don't Be Evil".

I have some very amazing Chinese / Asian friends as well as friends from all over Europe and the world...  Internet has helped I think to dissolve borders and pre-conceived differences / stereotypical views...  I think growing up in the UK (Indian and Chinese food are the nation's favourite cuisine) it's all been so mixed for so long here you don't really see the divisions...  Then traveling to Asia opens your eyes...  I miss so many things about Asia when I'm back in the West, and vice versa.
But everyone has prejudices - even British people about Brits from other parts of their own country (if you visited a northern suburb vs. an affluent seaside city town there's a huge difference in culture and attitude to 'outsiders')...  It's gonna' be the same for Chinese people from different suburbs / cities too no doubt.  
But if you embed yourself in the places and take time to just sit and get to know people, it's not long before you realise we're really all the same.

What we have to do with *all* these things is go wayyyyy back in history and see how we got to where we are today.  So you have Korea split in two, the Russians took the top half, the Americans the bottom half.  Meanwhile the UK until 1996 had Hong Kong.  We also had the Russians taking East Berlin, Americans the rest of Berlin after WWII.
The Brits created Pakistan so that Muslims could go chill, and Hindi's could get on with their thing in India.  Israel had its little thing created after WWII...We had communism doing its thing in Eastern Europe... and, whew, see how complicated all this is getting?
Berlin wall came down in 1989, iron curtain came down afterwards, EU was created, and free passage between European states began.  It's worked rather nicely, despite all the stupid arguments over legislation, European people themselves are more united than ever.
Then the internet came along, and rather than slap a patent on it and let each country have its own corporate internet, Tim Berners Lee thought it would be much more fun to let the entire planet figure out its differences via one messy global database of truth we call the internet.  Wikipedia has meant we could all begin figuring things out without any one government able to twist that truth.
The Arab spring happened as Arabs began to piece together their history and realise they could all be one.  Occupy saw 250 camps over the world protesting against corporate greed; the pope came out in support, Hong Kong followed with their protests.  The zero day exploit "Red October" swept the world and global intelligence became more and more decentralised, Ed Snowden, Julian Assange did their thing...
Then Trump happened and all of a sudden, just as the left thought they were getting a handle on all this, Trump threw a brick through it all and managed to galvanise the ultra right to the point where America is now gripped by actual facism, in much the same way the Greeks saw the rise of the golden dawn nazi part at the height of their financial unrest.
That's very scary, for everyone involved, none more so than N. Korea, whose only defence against the possibility of invasion from a rogue U.S. administration looking for war, is to up the ante.  That's the stupid zero sum game everyone has been playing.
But look between the lines... Even the U.S. main cyber defence team recently resigned from the administration under protest, such is their concern over Trump's ability to govern sanely.  Do you really think he could come anywhere near to actually pushing the button?  Do not forget that Nixon tried that on Vietnam and watergate ensued.
The solution, as always, can only come from rational, calm, dialogue.  We did not fix the IRA bombings in the UK with more bombings, it took Clinton and John Major to broker a peace armistice and listen to both sides of the debate.  China / Russia are the peace brokers in all this.
Bitcoin / North Korea stuff is fluff, we all know about the Super Dollar, and the fact N. Korea can print U.S. Dollars better than the U.S. can.  
China aren't turning the screws on ICOs or Exchanges to hurt bitcoin *or* N. Korea IMO; they're doing it to help legitimise bitcoin in the long run and help save ordinary Chinese mamas and papas who want in from getting screwed by scam artists.
It would make no sense for North Korea to be using Bitcoin, since it's infinitely more traceable than using cash or a hidden crypto they could create themselves that doesn't even need to ever go public.
Everything is a mess out there, but not beyond redemption.  Clearly the solution is to empower individuals within North Korea with internet and bitcoin and crowdfund campaigns (with the blessings of the ruling classes) and for the people of the world to take an active role in helping the country get on its feet, just as it took grassroots campaigns to help with the recent Syrian refugee crisis gripping Europe. 
It will take time, but it took time too, for the Berlin wall to come down.  We know Eric Schmidt (president of Google) has visited Kim, we know Dennis Rodman has too.  We need lots more people to go out there and offer their ear and expertise without passing judgement or trying to impose western morality on them.

Segwit activation and successfully getting through the BCH hardfork.  It took a gargantuan effort from the entire ecosystem (core, exchanges, FUDbattlers on twitter / reddit, UASFers) to get there.  
The rally was the effect of a massive collective sigh of relief.  Everything in this space is about psychology ("If you want to know what markets will do, don't ask an economist, ask a psychologist :p" — Lord Goldsmith).
The China news is unexpected and the next potential fork (Segwit 2x) looms ever closer so people are taking profits off the back of knee-jerk panic sells instigated by the silly Dimon comments (he made the same comments almost verbatim in 2014 and no-one paid the slightest bit of attention).  
All the new users here are probably unaware of that history, hence the needless airtime Dimon was given.  
Having just returned from the Paris Lightning meet, I can say the mid / long term tech fundamentals are looking stronger than ever, so we just need a little patience as the old and new world adjust to the changes.  China news is probably good long term: things do need to be tightened on the ICO / Exchange front (since there's so much room for scammers right now) if we want Mama and Papa using all this safely.
If you can forget about the prices and just go enjoy the rest of the summer until after November, then that's probably a good idea...  If you're in over your head and a bit panicky, don't feel bad about about taking some profit, and buying some peace of mind so you too can go enjoy the rest of the summer (life is to be lived and enjoyed right now, not dreamt away through what some imaginary numbers might buy you tomorrow).

Don't think we're gonna' need even that.  If we envisage Layer 2 taking off and encrypted blockstack data layers storing your identification, medical records etc. which only an entity you give permission to can read (but not store) then identity can pegged onto your bitcoin wallet and only you will be able to spend it (that identity layer could include biometrics and facial recognition if you so choose).
James D'Angelo was talking about this a few years back.  Basically you wouldn't even need to carry a wallet, card, passport around with you, it would all be there in an encrypted data record, allowing you to walk through airport security / into a shop and pay with nothing but facial recognition and/or your fingerprint to unlock and approve a transfer.
Obviously that's layer 3 sci-fi stuff (:p) but absolutely doable with hardware technology / layer 2 frameworks that already exist today.

I'm British, we were never trained in the art of 'shilling', I believe that to be an Americanism largely coined by the likes of Alex Jones.  
Since [the objective of bitcoin is to get us to here]( any kind of dosage of red pill the old world are willing to embrace is good for bitcoin, and anything that eases the transition for *ordinary* people who have no interest in learning esoteric ins-and-outs of key ownership, is good for bitcoin.
Let's also tone down the banker bashing, as much as your myopic view of the world likes to simplify everything and tarnish them all with the same brush, I would remind you that many of the people that have come over to bitcoin have, prior to this, come from that old world.  They are as integral to helping techies fix all this as everyone else.  
After all, if we can't understand all the broken things they've been juggling (by working *with* them), how on Earth are we gonna' all figure out how to transcend those things?  
Not everyone lurks in the shadowy underworld.  
If bitcoin is going to work it needs **everyone** onboard and if you truly believe in the freedom of individuals to choose exactly what they do and don't spend their bitcoin on, then you will accept that some people will want to use a debit card.
Accept that, stop seeing this whole thing as a fight, and the world you dream of will get a little bit closer.

Of course internet denizens of the "information wants to be free" persuasion realised none of that is inline with objective reality many decades ago.


As with gender, [neuroscience tells us there are no physical differences between the make-up of our neurons]( and nothing stopping the individual cognitive evolution of those neurons.
Which is why we were able to collectively overcome all kinds of nationalist fervor in the past: the abolition of slavery, introduction of gay and women's rights, civil rights, the iron curtain coming down, peace in Europe and free travel zones, have all been great leaps moving us toward greater unity and the realisation we live in a world of abundance where borders and tribes are no longer fit-for-purpose.
The internet too, shows us that actually there's very little difference between the brains of young and old (impossible to know the age, colour or gender of someone you are talking to on reddit) which shines a whole new light on this being human thing.

Segwit itself did an effective 2mb blocksize increase just from code-optimisations.  
Lightning network scales to billions of transactions, massively outperforming anything on-chain scaling is capable of.
Do [take a look at Zap]( for an insight into how all that can be harnessed to allow for instant virtually zero fee transactions via this Layer 2 tech.
This is a game-changer when it works in tandem with bitcoin being beamed down from satellites to the 4 billion people on the planet currently without access to the global economy.
Of course, some people (and companies) in this space are yet to use their imagination to see that far into the future, distracted as they are, by numbers in a spreadsheet.
But many do see this future, and they will be the ones who eventually prevail since it is their ideas that will best serve humanity (and this technology) moving forward.

You wouldn't take a column in entertainment weekly about quantum physics seriously.
If you're in this sub it's likely you already understand bitcoin better than non technical journalists who are forced to earn their crust from attention grabbing articles for their advertising driven paymasters.
Well meaning luddites afraid of change who are yet to even read the bitcoin whitepaper are gonna' try pull everyone back as sure as those that tried to stop the ploughs and the printing presses and closure of coal mines did.  Have pity on them and seek to educate rather than ridicule.  Many of them are our parents and grandparents with the same worries about the future as everyone else.

It would be a very silly move to go ahead with this against the will of the majority of the users and core developers who have been here from the beginning.  
With the brightest minds leaving the space should Team 2X brute force this away from Core, we'd see a mass exodus of the smartest and most trusted people in this space.  
Bitcoin just wouldn't be bitcoin for those who have most invested their time, energy and love into this project from the start.
In light of such an exodus, what then for Jeff and the NYA teams that rely on the goodwill of coders in this space who largely dedicate their time and energy for free?
Well, BTC1 and NYA companies would have no option but to pay everyone to work on their implementations - they would no longer be able to rely on the 200+ coders that contribute to Core purely out of their love for this technology.  Take a look at all the Core contributions to Jeff's last update to get an idea of the kind of talent that would be lost.  Not to mention all the bug fixes and peer reviews...
As we saw with MySpace vs. Facebook, money is never the best incentive for having people build beautiful things; there's only so much work you are prepared to put in for someone else when you're being paid by the hour - that clock strikes 5pm and off you go, bugs or no bugs.  A disposition nicely summed up here by Peter: ["It's not that I'm lazy, it's just that I don't care"]( ;)
Then there's the fact a highly contentious coup like this is going to anger some of the brightest coders on the planet (that comprise core and all the teams at universities currently working on implementations).
All this leads to a very different working environment for everyone in this space...
Rather than the open, collaborative scene we have today, we'd see NYA signatories and 2X dev teams working in closed, hush hush environments, paranoid that every code push is going to be prodded by a disgruntled ex-core dev, in much the same way finance incumbents have to hire outside contractors to triple check every line of code their teams commit...  Sounds horrible and would inevitably lead to a massive slowdown in productivity, not only on 2X development but with NYA implementations, and Bitcoin as a whole. 
And I doubt that exodus would lead to anyone in this space giving up on bitcoin - the idea.  How long until a third fork comes along that blows 2X out of the water using the same tactics Jeff is using here, but with a different PoW backed by some seriously pissed off VC's and investors in this space who'd be more than happy to throw millions at new mining equipment for Bitcoin Core V2?
Far cleverer then for Jeff (and NYA signatories) to do this responsibly and add replay protection so that everyone can continue working on Bitcoin and share code and ideas freely with one another across the 3 different implementations, without having to keep looking over each others shoulders or second guessing what the other 'team' is going to do next.  
Much better to keep the goodwill going so we're looking over each others shoulders for the right reasons, i.e. not out of paranoia, but because we all share a mutually beneficial interest in seeing *everyone* in the space succeed.
There's really only ever been one 'team'.  
It would be wise for those who signed that slip of paper in NY to remember that, and get back on the right side of history, because the internet is never going to forget a single action any of us take in this space.

Everything should be legal except greed and ignorance ;)
We know from 10 years of decriminalization (of everything drugs wise) in Portugal that it works.  We also know from academic studies that the silk road had a huge positive effect in removing violence and drug-related deaths (due to impurities) off the streets.
What we have in the UK is soft touch, passive policing, everything is, in effect, already legal.  You could walk around Brixton in the 90's and see Rastas openly smoking spliffs in pubs, same with the warehouse scene in London today, and Brighton where people smoke openly on the beach and in quiet cafe corners.  
Those that are punished are the gangbangers and profiteers that seek to exploit others; a blind eye is turned to the rest.  
Pot can be just as damaging btw, in terms of the paranoia, laziness and lethargy that sets in after heavy use (that paranoia is often a result of the illegal activity itself and the 'us' vs. 'them' underground drug culture that develops leading to clusterisation which results in heavier use paving a gateway into more harmful drugs and bigger highs — mostly through environmental boredom, just as drinking at the same pub day in day begins this slippery slope to heavy alcoholic addiction).  
You will observe in places like Amsterdam where pot is legal (and that paranoid culture isn't rife), most people aren't that enamored by it.  
In addition, one of the biggest problems with pot in recent years has been the frankenstinian modified strains of skunk which are more like hallucinogenics than the traditional mellow high one gets from hashish. 
We know from prohibition in America, banning stuff and making stuff illegal just makes people want to do it more, and encourages things to go underground where exploitation will happen.  
The solution is just to accept that all individuals have a right to put whatever they want in their body as long as they are aware of the risks and are not themselves harming others around them.  There also needs to be an effective social safety net that treats drug problems as a disease rather than a crime, should those people fall prone to addiction.
As we're seeing from pot being legalised in Canada and key American States, we're getting there :)

Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's full of them.
In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read.

There is no truly honest argument they could make that would lead to ordinary users siding with business interests that require forever taking a slice of their economic energy over a rapidly changing science and technology that has already evolved beyond the need for those early 'AOL Online' type gateways that many of these bitcoin companies mimic.  
The crux of the issue is a ton of young bitcoin corporations new to the world of the internet and business have positioned themselves as these middlemen gatekeepers expecting the tech to stand still.  Users will ultimately go to the service that will best serve their needs, not the needs of board members and VCs that have guessed the optimal solutions.  
Far better these new companies begin to understood the true promise of bitcoin lies not with gatekeepers but in rebuilding the entire system through enabling the rising 4 billion on this planet completely cut off from global commerce.  Fix that, we fix all the things that lead to poverty, war and forced economic migration.
Time for people in this space to get with that program so instead of focusing on price and taking a battering ram to the old world (and each other) we can inspire everyone in and outside this space into thinking about just how incredible this new world can be.  
There's very little room in that future for idealogically driven companies fixated on ROI and price...  Building companies with a grand vision for building a better world for tomorrow is nothing new; it's why billionaires who have seen all this before still get out of bed in the morning.
Do we want those billionaires on the train with us and a stable bitcoin currency we can truly rely on as a store of actual wealth?

In a way, your comment represents the very epitome of 'primitive man'.  i.e. they who think technology stands still and lack the vision and foresight to help shape it's evolution.  It is not this thinking that tamed fire which was then used to invent the first technology (cooking) that helped bring about the cognitive revolution.
Bitcoin does not stand still any more than the cooking fire built with sticks and stones stood still... 
The future will see a world of decentrlised eco-friendly mining, where every consumer device is powered by a bitcoin mining chip (we now have 14nm consumer level chips).   We may even see new proof of work algo's like Bram Cohen's Proof of Space integrated.

We can't expect those that have been busy working 9-5 holding the threads of the old world together to have had the time to invest in understanding this new technology (and the world of tomorrow it makes possible) any more than we can expect my English teacher of old to have had the time to take a year off teaching Shakespeare to understand what computers would mean for the world of today.

Many comparisons to bitcoin businesses can be drawn.  Their recent clashes with TFL in London are an example of New World businesses thinking they can come in with tech and smash down the doors on old world companies that have been operating for decades (and with it all the accrued safety checks, balances, jobs and procedures that revolve around paper-belt pen and ink).  
Both worlds need to come together for all this to work without friction and truly set us all free...  And we see progress and concessions being made on both sides to that end (Black Cabs in London must very soon by Law include the ability for customers to pay by card instead of cash for instance).
I hope UBER win their appeal, but on the proviso they make a bunch of concessions that embrace some of those old ways that have been established for good reason.  Giving Black Cabs access to UBER tech for Free would be one step in the right direction.
If they don't, another app will come along that does and all those UBER drivers will migrate, since the free-market need for UBER amongst a younger more tech savvy demographic will remain.   
Same goes for bitcoin businesses that don't give a shit about finance companies in that old word (and people with livelihoods relying on them) they seek to disrupt.

**Seeing the solutions**
We start with Why?  Why does this company / product / service exist.  If it's simply to make money or to compete, this new world has no room for you.  
We don't need a million different web browsers, cameras, smartphones, laptops, lawnmowers, bitcoin wallets, newspapers competing for headlines, or operating systems.  We need one of each that is worked on by multiple teams and individuals within companies that design these things to economise and make best use of the resources we have available.  Participants will be rewarded by the crowd itself much like we see on Kickstarter. 
We don't need to own houses, cars or anything in this new world.  Much of what we feel we need may be ported over to VR spaces, including in the more distant future, computers themselves. 
The idea of 'digital nomads' is already one that has taken amongst the younger generations.  Future citizens will have global citizenship: karma and good reputation will become *the* most important currency.  They will be able to work from anywhere on anything.  People will move away from specialisation and get involved in all kinds of community-driven builds all over the world.  UBI will provide a support blanket but it will perhaps be in the form of something like Patreon and even Reddit (where contributing positively to online communities provides you with real world economic energy).
Blockchain running over satellite uplinks will enable the rising 4 billion who do not have access to the global economy to start participating.  Expect a worldwide crowdfunding platform to enable ordinary citizens to help bootstrap communities there and benefit from trade without middlemen sucking up economic energy.  Starting a LETS style economy would be as easy as providing people on the ground with cheap mobile phones, raspberry pi and an app for creating an alt currency specific to their needs, that can hook into the atomic swap network.  
This can happen in western communities too, with liquid democracy platforms and decentralised council meetings happening online.  Central governments will be replaced with macro and micro voting platforms linked to global citizen ID systems.
VR town planners will begin submitting new ideas for the community to vote on and the many empty shops and broken down urban centres we see today will suddenly be rejuvenated by the crowd themselves.
The idea that we allowed animal slaughter (and the normalisation of violence that comes with it) will start to look as despotic to future generations as burning witches at the stake and lynching look to us.  With the eradication of the need for large-scale animal farming and the introduction of vertical farms all that land will become available to citizens currently huddled together in cities.  One only has to fly over say, the UK or Canada to see that the vast majority of the land is empty.  The idea we are overpopulated is a myth (although western populaces are declining anyway).
There will come a time, I am quite sure, where generations that follow will wonder how on earth we survived when it was ok to knowingly tell and spread untruths.  Telling lies, exaggerating for personal or political gain will no longer be tolerated.
Usury (loaning money) in the west will come to an end.  Islam doesn't have it and functions perfectly well.  Indeed, they have no taxation either; everyone gives away around 10% of their earnings a year to ideas and organisations they care about.  There is no reason a similar voluntary taxation system couldn't be bought to the West and coupled with a resource taxation system that encouraged people to share land and material goods that have little use and would benefit the rest of the community.
With the ubiquity of things like livestream and our increasing willingness as a networked society to open up our whereabouts to the crowd, violent crime (and crime in general) will flatline, as citizen-based policing, governance and crowd-based online jury's will get to sift over events and evidence.  We have seen early precursors to this with the 4chan community doing crowd-based detective work that has eclipsed what traditional law and enforcement are capable of.  
Expect some radical solutions to energy, we're not too far away from all fossil fuel being phased out.  The many timelines we hear from governments of "clean energy in 30 years" are all based on the current broken economic models where money doesn't mean anything.  With the advances coming via bitcoin all of that changes and with it, those timelines.
**How we get from here to there**
First of all we all need to agree on a narrative, a reason for 'being'.  Is our quest as a species to simply strive for hedonistic rewards, compete for pixels of land and material goods against one another, or is it to think long and hard about the universe that birthed us and dream of bigger things and greater discoveries.  
Space is now a viable reality, as are inner-worlds via VR, age reversal, the eradication of disease... Fixing the economy and the systems that govern the creation and adoption of these ideas, brings them even closer.

Does it though?  Remember, Satoshi originally wanted everything from exchanges, wallets and a global tradenet all running through the client.  It was only when the Wikileaks announcement revealed this quiet little project to the entire world that business descended. 
Do we need 100's of exchanges, wallets and commission-taking businesses creating a new middleware gateway to all of this?  Technically speaking, the answer is no, as atomic swaps and decentralised exchanges are showing.
Did the world ever need more than one open source browser with the whole software community updating and keeping it secure, prior to Bill Gates et al treating the internet like a business and starting the Browser Wars?
All questions and assumptions we need to think deeply about, which has meant me personally having to revise a couple dozen whitepapers to keep up with the rapid evolution of the technology.


That's the crux of all this.  It will be users of those new services that decide how this all ultimately plays out, just as users of the internet eventually decided they had no need for the walled internet gardens of AOL Online and Compuserve acting as technology gatekeepers.

It's all relative: nations comprise of people shaped by different environmental conditions and cultural norms.  
We rely far too much on the media and third parties telling us what to think and feel about one another based on the ill conceived notion that we are all somehow different... we then recycle this xenophobia as fact without questioning whether the information we've allowed shape our views is actually true.
Cyberspace enables all of us to reach out to one another across borders and see the truth: we have far more in common with one another than those who seek to separate would have us believe.

There is a lot of work that needs to be done here finding the right balance between openness and security of the sensitive data AirBnB users are sharing.  
Btw, there is a private API that AirBnB gives companies who have shown they will put in the right checks and balances to ensure that data is not abused and that they are offering something that will augment and enhance the AirBnB experience.

When you let a car into traffic on a busy road, do you think about the political ideology, religion, sexuality, 'race' of the person you're letting in?  Or do you let them in because if roles were reversed you'd hope they'd do the same for you?
Jeez, no-one in Europe has even heard of liberterianism.  And bitcoin certainly doesn't care about it or any other ism.
We have to stop putting ists and isms on everything and everyone and do away with this putting people into little boxes to be labelled.  It is that red/blue/yellow tribalism that bought us to this mess setting the masses against one another fighting for crumbs tossed from upon high by those emperors with no clothes that lead the circus show.  
When in reality, we live in a world of abundance where we are all free to step up and become leaders if we are bold enough to leave our comfort zones and embrace the unknown.
Bitcoin and the networks of trust it will help build is about everyone: every culture, creed, belief system, working in harmony as long as the *individuals* within each network treat others kindly and fairly.  
OP is right in saying the average person doesn't see that, and that's because the average person is a fully signed up ticket holder to the circus show and the invisible prison walls that have been built around it to keep them caged within the spectator tent.
Time to step up, realise you can change the world with a smile and achieve anything you put your mind to in this world, as long as you're not forcing others to think, feel and do things they don't want to be doing.

Also worth noting it was the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory that build the TOR browser (and is still financed, I believe, by U.S. and Swedish governments).
Are we to infer from this that governments were 'too dumb' to see the 'threat' that their own creation of TOR would later pose?  Or is it possible they are constantly looking 10-20 years into the future and understand that society often goes through massive shocks and challenges (such as the internet) that forces government and law to evolve?

Sure.  We already have it.  
Look at the jobs you can get now from the social capital we have accrued...  Few Silicon Valley companies care about exam results, they're more interested in looking at what you can demonstrably prove you have already done.  Contribute to Github in a meaningful way and you will easily find yourself a job...
Reputation through Linked.In and Angel List, Youtube ratings, Twitter followers that help great bands get found, Patreon that rewards content creators, Kickstarter and Indiegogo that reward ordinary people with good ideas and big beautiful dreams...  
Changetip (when it was running) was perhaps an early precursor to all this.
And of course, Reddit with it's beautiful Karma system already well established.  The only missing link is how that be pegged to real world economic energy, which alts coupled to atomic swaps seem to be an elegant solution for when LN rolls out.
As for a global AI 'monitoring' toxicity of comments / people in a debate.  We already have that, it's called the downvote and the 'unfollow' button.  This is just a cleaner, more efficient way of helping people think about what they are putting out there into the world.
The only people who really have to be concerned about any of that, are those that get a kick out of bullying and abusive behaviour.  
Of course, I'm sure there will be places for the bullies to congregate in their own private little caves whilst the rest of humanity who want to get along will be free to do so in an increasingly more open and transparent web that actually rewards good behaviour with real world social mobility accrued from helping others online.

In terms of being shoe-horned into an old-world 2-tier justice system of regulation, bitcoin is immune.  But this will lead to the network and users themselves self-regulating, just as reddit and countless other websites are governed by the crowd and the code of conduct peers have agreed to abide by.
Eventually web of trust style networks built on something akin to the blockstack backbone will begin to record in the global ledger those individuals and companies that can (and cannot) be trusted with your economic energy and private data, leading - for the first time in living memory - to a truly egalitarian level of transparency that means it will be far better for everyone to play fairly than to work out how to cheat the system.
Expect to hear the phrase "glass governance" a whole lot as the ramifications of this begin to filter up to macro and micro governmental bodies and institutions and everyone who thinks deeply about the future of their children and this planet, begin to get excited about what this is going to mean for humanity when we can finally close the door on that old demon haunted world that had us wrongly believing fellow humans are not to be trusted.

I believe the fork will be a good thing overall and will, in the longer term, be better for all participants in the ecosystem, allowing faster innovation due to there being less competing voices impacting the work on each chain.
The friction we've witnessed over the last few years is largely the result of two completely different philosophies (call it big business interests vs. computer scientists that have more long term aspirations for the social impact that can be made with the technology).  Neither philosophy can work if they are at odds with one another, but both can augment each other further down the line if we allow each 'side' to work in peace.  
The chief architects of all this remember only too well how the internet boom/bust setback internet development, shockwaves are still being felt today in that regard.  It's therefore incumbent upon those on the Big Business side to acknowledge they won't seek to use the Bitcoin protocol as a get-rich-scheme like Bill Gates and others did during the Browser Wars era...
That doesn't mean there won't be a cross-over of energy and ideas from the two camps in the short to medium term as the space matures and things like LN and Atomic Swaps begin to make more sense for everyone involved. 
In that respect, we're all back to ground-zero, and it requires as much research as bitcoin itself did at the beginning to see how all this is going to unfold.  If you're not a computer scientist or an engineer or interested in the social science side of all this, those changes around the corner won't be of much interest if you still hold the view bitcoin needs to be a payment instrument, like, tomorrow.  For many of us that have been thinking deeply about socio-economic problems since the crash, the payment instrument side of bitcoin are its least interesting property.  Hence the focus on security as a store of value that is bulletproof.
So let BCH / B2X experiment with their visions I say as we move forward separately together...  And remember DCG have as much invested in the ideas of Blockstream / Blockstack and others on the more social good side of all this as they do those on the side of big business.  
TL;DR: The best thing for all participants in the ecosystem is to put this latest round of infighting behind us and add replay protection, so that we can all get on with shaping the future along different visions.

Still, they could see we were good kids and, after a number of months, we'd join in the occasional game of Snooker with them, and eventually saw merit in their slow old timer sport, and they learnt a few pool tricks from us that they could apply to their Snooker games :)

You might ask yourself why so many are still here working their arses off, given the meteoric rise in price that would mean nearly all those who started this project could have retired long ago.  You also might wonder why it is - given all the various crashes in the past - that those same people still continued on through thick and thin way, way before many of the people commenting here obsessed by price had even heard of bitcoin.  Perhaps the same reason great artists still make music after multi-platinum selling records?  Perhaps, there is more to life for some people than money?  Could it be?
These are groups of people who took very great personal risks in ensuring this idea survived and laid the way for (and invested in both monetarily and cognitively) - things like ethereum.
 
You may ask yourself too, why so many of those original bitcoiners continue to hammer home the message that the price - whether it is $1 or $1m - is just a distraction.  There is a reason, after all, that [this is the most enduring bitcoin meme](  
Most who have done well in this life will tell you they got there by solely focusing on helping others...  Bitcoin, like Ethereum, is just a tool; it is the infrastructure, ideas and people who believe in one another and what the future may one day look like... that will see their ideas flourish and achieve the greatest good for humanity as a whole.
The truth is, a good portion of those involved at the very beginning of bitcoin had already gotten 'rich' through their internet ventures or simply from the fact they were already in really well paid computing jobs (Mike Hearn as one of Google's security chiefs working in bitcoin in his spare time is a good example).  And so money and personal gain had never been a factor in bitcoins early development… any more than money was a factor for the founders of Reddit,  Hacker News, Wikipedia, Popcorn Time, Piratebay, IRC, Linux, Last.FM... the list is endless.  
Programmers have always been a caring, sharing bunch in love with their art.  Way before the internet we had the Public Domain where home computer aficionados would freely share their code and show off their creations.  You only need to go on stack exchange to see how this has evolved; just how much ideas and solutions are shared for the love of helping others in their own creations.  There's nothing quite like the rush of building something beautiful and seeing others fall in love with it (be that music, an invention, a house you built by hand, or an internet site).  
The 2008 crisis was a wake-up call for many old neckbeards and computer scientists who had been thinking very deeply about the worlds problems since the 90's...
Crypto Currency, Universal Basic Income, Resource Based Economies were not new ideas.  Nor was the concept of an internet powered by micropayments as opposed to advertising (this was always supposed to be how websites were funded).
And so yes, many involved are here - believe it or not - because they felt a duty to fellow humankind to help shape the internet and new technologies that will get us toward a world of free association where we no longer have to live in a demon haunted world propagating fear, poverty and greed as if that was some kind of universal law. 
Sounds utopian, but so did the concept of the welfare state and free healthcare for all before the Brits went and did just that after WWII.  A system that is taken for granted today and works in many western countries very beautifully.
Can't speak for your own vision in this space, but me I see very clearly that world of abundance around the corner, a world where going to the moon and living on mars is a thing we can all strive to do in our lifetimes, once the measurement tools required to galvanize the human energy needed for those grand public good projects have been fixed.
Most of us, when we really think about it all gazing up at that grand cosmos... just want to know if we are alone in the universe.  
Can't say exactly how we'll all get there I just know, if history tells us anything, the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of those grand dreams.

You might say the same with Detroit, Michigan vs. New York.  But even those 'depressed' places have pockets of beauty and wonder to be found within the people and communities living there.
At the end of the day, it's not necessarily where you travel to, but who you are with, that counts (and you're always with *you*, so better start getting to like *you* before you head off somewhere new :p)

Bitcoin and the infrastructure and services being built around it are not stuck in some kind of technological cul-de-sac.  Far from it, everything is evolving at breakneck pace.


Here is an example of a new bitcoin loan platform that also works with ethereum:
Magnr have been operating in London for years now and offer higher interest than banks on bitcoin deposited with them.
Myriad other online loan p2p loan platforms offering better rates than banks (outside of bitcoin) have been operating for nearly a decade.  For example:
Microloan platforms have been established with great success to bootstrap African businesswomen amongst others, again without banks in the loop.
Bitcoin just further streamlines the process without the need for fiat bridging.  It is probably just a matter of time now for all these already established services to begin bootstrapping bitcoin into the process (and with it their millions of already satisfied users).  
Expect p2p insurance, real estate rentals and purchases (we saw the first block of luxury condos for sale in Dubai via BTC just last week) and, well, basically anything that would be cheaper and more frictionless were middlemen (and the profits they take) replaced with instant one-click subroutines that can offer the same levels of surety via crowd-backed escrow type contracts and services.  
Gets even more exciting when indiegogo, kickstarter, seedrs, patreon and others get onboard the bitcoin train. 
What wiggle room does this leave for banks and traditional finance brokers?  That's really a tough one to answer when even non crypto related startups are now launching banking apps that cut them out completely and arguably offer a better service and overall banking experience.
Are all able to offer the average consumer virtually everything a bank can and, moreover, are enabling open API's that allow businesses to build all kinds of custom backends they wouldn't normally be able to do with traditional banking systems.

This is a very important point.  The acute inescapable [hedonic adaptation]( Julian must be feeling is inexcusable in today's world.  A world where science has proven that [caging people]( and forcing them to live in conditions like this leads to them becoming greater abusers down the line.  Julian is fortunate that the internet provides an outlet for his intellect and the basic human need for contact. 
But the internet cannot replace the very basic human rights we all deserve:  Simple pleasures such as the sun shining on our face, the freedom to go contemplate our existence down at a river bank, or to look at a blanket of stars as we think about the grander ontological perspective.  
Whilst I understand the old world is fearful of Julian and what he might do were he to step outside that embassy, they fail to see that by keeping him cooped up he is more likely to pose a threat to them since they continue to exert force.  Did we learn nothing from the house arrest of Galileo when he was deemed a heretic by the church for saying we lived in a helio-centric universe? 
The best thing for Julian - and those that seek to keep him caged - would be to let him go live some time in an open house near some of that nature I was talking about.  Why not seek to let him start a computer science academy (maybe working with Amir at his 'hacker academy' in Barcelona) and, instead of fighting Julian, free that amazing brain (and bitcoins) of his so that he may put it all to work weaving a great deal of public good for the world.  
I daresay that both Amir and Julian could bring about a lot of positive global change through their mastery of technology and foreign affairs if they were given a chance to work at such an academy together.  And perhaps, if Julian was given the basic freedom to go outside and breathe some fresh air and think deeply about the world, we could all start getting along with the very important business of thinking about what humanity wants to do after the great information renaissance we stand on the precipice of, frees not just Julian, but the entire of humanity.

As sure as all the work on Google Maps (cafe, business ratings etc.) are transferrable and measurable on a global, immutable ledger.
UBER's recent change in CEO (a bitcoin believer) should also see them embracing all this in some really exciting ways we've yet imagined as they open up the platform with API's that allow for all kinds of cool open source experiments (including old world cab companies themselves integrating UBER tech-based solutions), much like we're seeing Banking apps exposing their data via API's.
You might also be interested in looking up Arcade City for an example of an early pilot routing all this through a decentralised network of blockchain-powered cab drivers.

The biggest problem amongst nearly all bitcoiners is thinking *any* of these centralised services will exist a year from now.  
Those who understand what lies ahead see a future full of opportunity for everyone; a future that is very, very bright.  And it is that optimism and belief in a better world that will ultimately prevail.  
 
With atomic swaps, rootstock, bitcoin satellite arrays on-boarding 4 billion people, p2p mesh networked tradenets, openbazaar 2.0, some kind of UX friendly implementation of Lighthouse... everything from exchanges to nu-middlemen SQL hubs like bitpay and changetip will be ancient history.  
**Bitcoin is defined by the real world-changing solutions it offers**, not the many men and women in suits shouting "It's all about the Benjamins!" 
(Yes, I've heard that sentiment all too often at conferences from the new pretenders in this space, fresh out of the restroom after their last line of coke).
These people are not scientists, engineers or, even, particularly good business people (since their business models and the codebases that result revolve around bitcoin existing in the world of today instead of the world of tomorrow it was created for).
*"I’m an inventor. I became interested in long-term trends because an invention has to make sense in the world in which it is finished, not the world in which it is started.” — Ray Kurzweil*
Changetip, Bitpay, Changelly - none of these inventions make sense in the beautiful new Web 3.0 world of tomorrow bitcoin now straddles, any more than a &lt;marquee&gt; html tag makes sense in a world that long ago introduced css transitions as a more elegant solution.  
These men and women don't get to decide the fate of bitcoin, any more than business people of old got to decide the fate of the internet when they made their power grab in the mid-90's...  nor do they get to shake glittery things in an attempt to lure in, subvert and control the *actual* users and builders of this technology (i.e. the people this *really* effects).
As such it is those users and builders that will ultimately decide bitcoins fate, no matter how many (fools)Gold-Plated toys those nu-middle people throw out of their prams.
**So who gets to shape this brave new world of web 3.0? (and by extension bitcoin)**   
*"We should strive to do things in [Gandhi's] spirit: not to use violence in fighting for our cause, but by non-participation in anything you believe is evil." — Albert Einstein*
First of all.  **You do**.  
Through the companies you choose to give your patronage to in this space.  You have every opportunity to put your bitcoins where your mouth is and only support those companies that you feel comfortable have the best interests of bitcoin - and humanity as a whole - deeply etched into their raison d'être. 
Principally the biggest impact then, will come from the many long-established internet sites and services that have defined the internet as we know it today... and the teams of people they have working within who know how computer science works and how it can best be deployed to free humanity from the broken system we currently cling to... 
It **will not** come from angry little men and women obsessed with power and control of all things glittery, who are merely toying with this technology and, as a result, just experiencing their first flushes of entrepreneurial success on the internet.
It is the "quiet one's" who work tirelessly behind the scenes in the light, people who have no twitter accounts, seek no plaudits and were here (and by here, I mean, here on the internet) since the beginning that are best served to shape the future of all this...  
Luckily for us, they are not interested in shiny little trinkets — they're more interested in the legacy they will leave (via their work) for their children (and the children of humanity)...  
Put quite simply: if there is no ["Why"]( to what you and your businesses do in this new world, then you are not going to get to cross the many bridges we are all building there to help humanity get across the chasm below.
Once announcements from: Youtube, Google, Gmail, Reddit, Airbnb, Ebay, Indiegogo, Bittorrent start being made, the tiny userbase of Coinbase and Bitpay will be just a blip in time, forgotten along with the blip that was AOL Online in this great electronic ocean of the internet...  
It doesn't even matter if those internet defining companies (and their billions of users) roll their services into Bitcoin v2.0 a year from now or, even, Litecoin.  All that matters is, like the internet itself, whatever protocol they run with is decentralised and governed by a consensus of scientists and engineers; as opposed to a small coterie of business people and miners with a vested interest in shackling bitcoin to the status quo instead of unleashing its limitless potential to positively rebuild the world anew...
In the meantime, as we each find our footing in this ecosystem, we might remember:
1. *“To live in the hearts we leave behind is to live forever.” — Carl Sagan.*  This is as true for the things we build and the art and words we give to the internet, as it is for the personal legacy we leave out there.  Do you want history - and the internet - to remember you as one of the good people who made the universe a more friendly place?
2. Pick which side of that history you want to be a part of.  Get busy helping those who stand with you.
3.  Be honest and true to the things you believe in and remember that the internet will never forget any of our actions in this space.
4. Remember there is a big beautiful world out there beyond bitcoin.  It, like bitcoin, evolves faster than many of us can keep up with.  It is that world bitcoin needs to be ready for.  
5.  Above all else, remember, it's not the destination  or the speed we travel at that matters, it's the journey itself.  So enjoy the ride!

And yet there are plenty jobs and companies now where payout is made in bitcoin (especially in the BTC space).  When we get to a world where no fiat on/off ramp is needed and suppliers, businesses and consumers are all transacting in BTC, the old fiat world becomes irrelevant to how many loaves of bread 1 millibit will buy ... just as the value of old Roman bronze coins are irrelevant to how much food you can buy with your mastercard ... then this whole bitcoin thing begins to make a lot more sense.

Woooh that's huge.  Explains why Women's car insurance is always consistently lower than mens by an order of magnitude.  


There was a whole backlash a few years back about using women as sex objects to sell stuff; which seems to have changed the way marketing agencies think about what they're putting out there.  
Question we must ask is why alcohol advertising is tolerated at all when we know through Professor [David Nutt's studies]( that alcohol is the *very* worst drug in the UK (in terms of damage it does to individuals and society at large).
Though even that's changing, more and more people in the UK are electing to cut out drink altogether and the industry is moving toward providing alcohol free alternatives.
The food industry is shifting massively towards ethical, organic and vegan meat and dairy replacements too (the fastest selling product in Sainsbury's recently was Vegan cheese with a 300% monthly increase in sales).
Conflate all that and we see a more confident species waking up, driven less by artificial stimulation and hedonistic impulse, and seeing the world as one, as we look to the stars for the next chapter in this grand story of ours :)

For the interim period, yes.  But then most things are.  Bitcoin is, arguably, the only thing that's actually impacting the real world and ordinary people, bar a few behind the scenes infrastructure pilots with ethereum.  But even ETH has no consumer adoption; it's nearly all used to fuel speculation on exchanges.
Impossible to say what Litecoin could do further down the line once atomic swaps, lightning, rootstock, blockstack are all well established.  I would see Litecoin over LN being used as the defacto choice for merchants and everyday western coffee purchases, with bitcoin being used as settlement for the purchase of real estate, land registry, insurance, commodities, aswell as forming the defacto settlement layer for all those transactions packaged up over LN.  
Even from a personal security standpoint, knowing all your bitcoins are locked away safe in a hardware wallet, and being able to go out with Litecoin on your phone like you might cash in your pocket, starts making more sense to everyone.
Will also be interesting to see what Google and others could do with Litecoin in the micropayments and machine-payable web space.  Although perhaps something with ethereum or another dedicated alt running over LN might make more sense there.
It's also difficult to say what might happen if 2X force a contentious hardfork.  Litecoin may end up being the place Bitcoin Core devs focus most of their time with Garzik et al being left to their own devices...  I assume Jeff wants to avoid that, but if he plays fast and loose with replay protection, then who knows?  Only so much under-appreciated hardworking devs will put up with before looking for a more harmonious working environment.
That's not to say a third fork wouldn't happen further down the line mind, with Core coming back after a few years of hardcore litecoin / lightning development that could be ported over to a new version of Bitcoin with different mining algos in place.  I love the eco-friendly Proof Of Space ideas Bram Cohen came up with for instance.  He seems to be working pretty close to Adam and the lightning team, so maybe a few surprise announcements regarding PoW are going to be in order.
These are all issues that need to be addressed over the next few years as this matures and that tells me Litecoin is massively undervalued and under-appreciated in the grand scheme of things.  FWIW it is, in my view, more important than Ethereum.
But I don't know any more than anyone else about the future, been wrong so many times, it's impossible to say how the myriad variables will unfold.  
Wouldn't be any fun if we did know though, right?

I'm sure he's a lovely guy, but I honestly don't know why we're linking to investors and economists.  Bitcoin is so much more than about money (which was the easiest accounting problem to solve with a blockchain).  We're on the cusp of the Netscape Navigator moment via Layer 2 solutions, and this whole space is about to get a lot more mind blowing...just like the internet got way more interesting when we started talking about what was possible beyond email and BBS.
We see far too many things being posted on here from financial press and economists who have no real clue what's going on anymore than dot-com investors understood why Amazon was a worthwhile longterm investment. 
Would be lovely to see way more TechCrunch and HackerNews articles posted here discussing what happens with all this tech a few years down the line when IoT and machine-paypable-web takes off and what it means for the world when bitcoin onboards the 4 billion unbanked into the global economy.

Very unlikely any of the companies involved in DCG, with a vested interest in seeing 2X go ahead, would be foolhardy enough to think something like this would work...  Jameson is not a core developer and the project isn't solely reliant on him, his twitter feed any more than it is anyone elses.  
Which is why, btw, it's crucial bitcoin development requires consensus from so many different people so that tactics like this could never work.

Nothing uphill about it.  I, and many of my friends who have been on the same journey have never felt healthier (especially mentally).  It's very easy in the UK now to go vegan since there are so many meat alternatives out there that taste just as good and are way more healthy.
Don't assume you are talking to a 'philosopher' waxing lyrical or somebody beneath you... I'm a hardcore scientist... And I'm blessed to say that many of my friends are also scientists and doctors whose PHD's have helped change the world; I also have a good friend who, like yourself, is working on curing cancer at UCL London (she studies cancer development in fruit flies and tells me their lab is getting really close now to having some striking results).
Indeed, it was actually one of my closest friends (one of the world's leading scientists on cognitive development before she went off to found an NGO) who convinced me to go Vegetarian many years ago...  After a long car journey arguing on the side of meat eaters she simply floored me by saying... "You know, you are too intelligent to be eating meat."  
Then I watched stuff like Earthlings, read into Einstein's views ("There is nothing that will benefit the individual and humanity as a whole more than the evolution to a vegetarian diet") and thew myself into the science behind all this.  And I realised I was on the wrong side of history and could no longer refute what the data was telling us if I truly did care about animals, environment, my own health.    
You have to invoke a little spirituality too of course, when it comes to asking: "what is conciousness?  what is the value of a life?  what gives humans such a privileged reference frame?".
But as you say, none of this happens in a one-size-fits-all vacuum: lab grown meat, the "Google" burger, Bill Gates' funding Beyond Meat / Eggs, all great backup plans that will - one way or another - lead us toward a future where animal slaughter is a thing of the past.   
But hey, this subject is so divisive, it's often like arguing with Dimon about Bitcoin ;)
What will be, will be.

A miner is an entity that can print money ;)
OTC trades are as simple as putting a stack of cash in an envelope.  Likewise, it's simple to move it into Monero or Zcash and go below the radar in the same way moving fiat into diamonds and offshore accounts is an easy way to move 'value' surreptitiously.  
But, just like with Swiss / Panama offshore company accounts, intelligence agents can still figure out the flow easier than with cash if you are truly doing bad stuff that society has said is unacceptable (think companies funding land mines, sex trafficking, child slavery etc.)
Indeed, the global public ledger makes tracking those things much much easier.
Truth is: We are very quickly moving towards a world where bitcoin and the global crowd elect to drop the kinds of levels of privacy and secrecy 'good' people have needed to partake in (without needing to leave it in the custody of third parties).  In such a world we thrive from openness and a mutually agreed set of value systems that allows good players to benefit far greater than anyone trying to cheat.  It is the antithesis to a zero-sum game, which we might call whole-sum.  i.e. we are incentivised to play fairly with one another as opposed to living under the threat of punitive measures should we not play nicely, which can be thought of as a carrot vs. stick approach, much like how your reddit Karma score reflects the kind of net positivity you bring to discussions on here.
As with everything though, it requires looking far into the future and understanding that bitcoin - the technology doesn't exist in a vacuum (there are many other scientific and sociological breakthroughs going on in parallel, as well as a rapidly changing internet landscape in which we get to deploy these ideas - Brave browser perhaps represents a glimpse into an internet that is no longer paid for by advertisers where good quality content is rewarded by billions of crowd backed micropayments).
Time and patience will see the ecosystem figuring out the optimal solutions.  Do not forget we are all still very early adopters and are yet to see the impact of Layer 2 technology (Lightning Network, Rootstock, Blockstack) being fused with Satellite nodes that finally brings the 70% of the planet currently without access to the global economy into the picture.
In this newly adjacent possible, I think talk of that old world will just elicit yawns from most as we collectively move on as a species toward true abundance for the 99.9% of the people on this planet who just want to figure out what lies beyond the stars :)  And of course, when the remaining 0.1% (across all social strata) fall in love with the same vision, it's not long before everybody starts pushing in the same direction.
Thanks for all your bitcoin support, you are as integral to all of this as everybody else :)

You have failed to answer any of the questions I asked you.  You have merely proffered your opinion on whether it is to be construed a brute force attack or not, and bought up the opinions of a few false idols and 'experts' in this space who are not computer scientists and engineers or people involved in the coding of all this from the beginning.  Nor do their opinions address the questions I asked you regarding the very serious conflict of interests I raised.
Conflicts I was happy to steer clear of until you raised the issue of VC interests tainting development.  
Further, you have also shown me that you just don't understand bitcoin - the idea. 
Which is fine, not that many bitcoiners do.
As for 'vowing war'?  You will see from my many comments on this, I have fought for both BCH and Jeff's right to fork the code as long as they do so responsibly.  BCH did, and I'm happy to support Roger and others in doing so.
Whilst we may all be on different paths, we each share the same goal.

Yes precisely: see [Jack Maller's ZAP]( already running on testnet.  Also [Eclair Wallet](


It's far from unproven, we're a few months off the first mainnet releases.  There's been a huge groundswell of work going on there.  Indeed, Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of www) tweeted out his blockstack ID last year, which shows you where the people who helped build the internet (people like myself) and *actual* computer scientists coding this, stand in all this.  Do you really need to know anything more than the *inventor* of the internet AND the bittorrent protocol (Bram Cohen) have endorsed all this?


Exactly, just as AOL Online and Compuserve were, in the end, no longer needed as Internet service gateways.  
Layer 2 allows scale to happen in the order of Billions of transactions without sacrificing the bullet-proof security of the underlying bitcoin protocol level code.  Increasing the blocksize does nothing, in the grand scheme of things to scale to the billions of transactions we need and *does* sacrifice security and robustness, both in terms of the blocksize itself getting unnecessarily bloated, and the brains maintaining it being in the hands of corporate vested interests.  
Far better, a system that revolves around consensus and transparency that (like the internet itself) anybody can get involved with.
In the end users will side with solutions that make most sense, both at the fund and personal data security level and the cost of moving those funds.  
Roll on LN and decentralised solutions like Zap with near zero-fee INSTANT transactions for all.

People forget that **bitcoin's success is solely down to the people involved**.  A fork is, first and foremost, the divergence of weak and average minds who aren't visionary enough to understand the longer project arc.  And because they lack this vision they get frustrated and impatient with a perceived lack of progress, failing to understand that whilst we ["have built castles in the air"]( they are no use without further solidifying the foundations.
On one hand we have the greatest scientists on the planet in this space thinking a decade down the line about solar powered mining rigs hooked up to satellites in space, whilst on the other side we have coteries of businessmen and women fixated on short term goals who see the world as nothing but a paper-money playground, wasting talent and energy on ICO's, middleware payment gateways, loan companies and coffee purchases that do nothing but try to hammer the round peg of bitcoin into the square hole that is the broken (and oh so boring) system it was built to transcend...  
Whilst still others are trying to use bitcoin to push their subjective, myopic worldviews into people's minds, in the exact same way our ancestors tried to use the technology of money to force their subjective cultural biases on others around the world... without having experienced first-hand or understood any of those cultures they sought to disrupt and impose those views upon.
Such is the huge disconnect of minds and voices in this space.    
And it is something we all knew would be coming, as soon as bitcoin began garnering interest from the very speculative VC's and predatory big businesses bitcoin will ultimately transcend.  
In short, you have a bunch of (mostly) white businessmen and women, newly endowed with money and 'power' who have never really built anything of worth on the internet; and they are being egged on by dinosaurs of the old world, unwittingly fighting against the ideas of thousands of the smartest coders on the planet who have been quietly working for decades keeping the internet free from the predatory practices of the very dinosaurs (think SOPA and PIPA) now attempting to move into this space.  
They forget that those old internet neckbeards are now middle-aged and are no longer the naive kids that gave their ideas and inventions to their parents for nothing, only to see those ideas borne of "information wants to be free" used as a battering ram to try to subvert the internet into a grotesque corporate play thing, a pale shadow of what Tim Berners-Lee imagined it one day could become...  Do we think it a coincidence that one of those middle-aged internet architects - Bram Cohen (the inventor of Bittorrent - the most disruptive p2p protocol on the planet) is now working alongside core on all this?    
Those greying internet denizens of this ilk are experienced enough now to not fall for the same trick and are quickly bringing up to speed a new generation of coders capable of carrying the torch forward with new energy.  They will not allow themselves to be corrupted by money, power, greed or 'twitter fame', since their primary interest is the same as it always has been at the beginning of the internet: to free the world's information and get this little family of crazy misfits and rebels into the starships we're all capable of building when we pool intellectual and economic energy alongside the grander ontological awakening all this leads to.
Eventually those completely different worldviews and longterm aspirations for this technology come head-to-head and the friction eventually reaches an impasse (as we're seeing with the latest hard fork).  Those who do not understand technology or see bitcoin in this transformative light begin to kick up dust storms.  And those weak and average (but mostly well-meaning) minds who would have been on the side of "but... but... heavier than air objects will never fly!" back in pre-aviation days, get to go their own way as they shake themselves out of an ecosystem of [cosmic revolutionaries]( that sound as crazy (to them) as the Wright Brothers did to their contemporaries.  
**In the end, it's about a 'side' that lacks imagination due to their in-built fears of what real, positive change means for their subjective view of 'reality'.**  Most are more comfortable with destruction than they are change, since destruction is something we have spent millennia as a species building coping strategies for, whereas change means embracing the unknown and daring to imagine a world without war, poverty or greed.  Such lofty goals are too transformative for many people to even conceptualise, let alone embrace.
*"The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.” — Buckminster Fuller*
An economics or business degree is about as useful in this space as a degree in glass blowing would have been to those drafting the original world wide web specs.  As such, the cleverest economists and businessmen and women in this space are accepting there is little utility in trying to shape the future of this space and are happily taking a step back and going back to school... Something I'm sure [Buckminster Fuller would highly approve of]( were he around today.
I say all this as a Computer Scientist who has been programming for 33 years and even I know I cannot keep up with the rapid pace of changes happening here, so God knows how someone with a completely unrelated non-technical background not versed in the scientific method must feel; but at least I speak *the language* needed to understand what is happening.
That's literally the crux of the issue here: if we were to go back to the days of the Grimoire it would be comparable to the few people in the world who had learnt how to master the art of the written word attempting to communicate the future of this new technology called "language" through the written word itself... to cavemen and women still speaking in grunts.  As such the only 'experts' you should be listening to are those that speak the language of computer science and those with the experience to know how all this needs to be structured if we are to avoid the same mistakes we all made in building the internet.  
You will notice those 'experts' will be the first to exercise great humility in telling you that even they don't know yet how this will all unfold, since there are too many moving parts to be folded into this.  The hardfork, in that respect, is arguably, a very simple engineering challenge in comparison to the many that lie ahead. 
I am well aware that having said all this will create an emotive response in the minds of those cavemen and women I just took a small dig at, which will fire cognitive dissonance to such a degree that they will leave this thread in a state of fight or flight.
Which is a shame, because we each have a very important role to play in this new world, regardless of background, such is the inter-disciplinary nature of this grand project build.  People just need to have the humility to step back and think deeply about what that their part might be and the role they are most passionate about playing and, crucially, be prepared to go back to school and start learning all over again... The most important introductory lesson in all of this is to understand that there is no future in this space for those who see themselves as glorious leaders...
**Bitcoin developers are not - and never can be - stooges that will lead your personal corporate army.**  That is a tough lesson for those who are used to being chieftains to learn, but it is a process that can begin right now by understanding just what we mean when we say [control is an illusion](
TL;DR: The fork going ahead actually strengthens bitcoin (the idea) by providing a nice little bubble wrapped space for people to go have fun in whilst the actual architects of all this are able to continue 'Plan B' in an environment relieved of the toxicity of nefarious (but no doubt well-meaning) actors in this space who have failed to grok the truly transformative potential of this technology.
i.e. "to the Moon!" ;)

You didn't mention leaders (I was responding to your comment above mentioning recalling nothing good in history coming of arguments and in-fighting)... All those institutions required arguments and in-fighting in order for the group as a whole to reach consensus on myriad contentious issues.  Although they are more commonly referred to as 'debates' of course ;)  
As for leaderless organisations that work like this?  
You only need to look to the occupy movement, or the anonymous collective to see how organisations with horizontal leadership comprising many 'working groups' has impacted our lives in recent history.  Occupy was the biggest mass-protest movement in the history of mankind, with around 250 camps around the globe, all of which were run and organised through consensus and with no formal leadership in place.  1000's of activist groups are run in this way too (through secret/closed facebook groups and hidden subreddits and the like).
W3C foundation (responsible for the internet) has similar consensus lead working groups.

It's not about a 2mb upgrade (that can happen on core at any time) it's about making myriad meaningful changes and code optimisations to the existing protocol and allowing Segwit (which is effectively a 2mb upgrade) to propagate whilst also working diligently on Layer 2 and ensuring that at all times the NO.1 PRIORITY is the security of the protocol and existing codebase.    
And, crucially it's about making sure none of that code can ever change without the consensus of the 200+ scientists behind it, that it remains bulletproof to any external influence or pressures from outside organisations with profit motives, and that the existing internet ecosystem (comprising many websites with billions of users like Google) are able to work out how those Layer 2 solutions fit into their websites and have a great team of scientists to collaborate with who understand open source principles.  
All of that takes time, just as building the internet and things like the email protocol took time.
Suggest you go to the bitcoin Github / IRC and Dev mailing lists if you're interested in the *actual* science behind all this.
If people disagree with that route, they are free to get involved on Github or the Dev mailing lists, or go fork this (as BCH did) and try a different path if they're in a rush.

They're ignorant of things like the Magna Carta, the Renaissance and the myriad other movements that happened in the past that showed that way of thinking always ends in the oppressed and downtrodden rising up.
Fortunately, 21st century technology and digital art (much like the technology of the printing press and the painting brush that came before) have given us all the opportunity to find a peaceful exit.  The speed and borderless nature of these digital communication channels means ideas that might have taken centuries to take hold in the old world, can now go viral and cascade through societies in a matter of seconds.
Truth is we exist in an era of God-Like technology that simultaneously exists alongside a class of technology luddites who still cling to the last vestiges of power in that old paper belt world.  They don't understand how facebook works, what LOL means, and certainly can't come to terms with a world that will soon be governed solely through the wisdom of well informed crowds coming together around new technology.
And so they need to go back to school in that respect, and the scientists behind all this need to dispense with the esoteric language, and begin communicating in more accessible English (and building UX solutions these old people can understand) so the whole thing doesn't look like a 'black box' to them.
In the meantime there will be, very soon, a nice little B2X playpen for all the paper-belt gatekeepers and businesses to throw money into who cannot yet grok the point of bitcoin.  Both worlds can breathe a sigh of relief in recognition those old world fears that have been holding science are being addressed... And these bitter disputes that have been holding real change back for the last few years in the bitcoin space (in much the same way anti-net neutrality bills like SOPA held the internet back) can finally be laid to rest.  We'd be wise to remember, both 'sides' have their faults due to the vast gulf of misunderstanding of what this new unfolding 'reality' means for the world.
We can, as a community, take this as an opportunity to come together and prove to the old world we can do this on our own, but it means each of us have to be engaged and be prepared to step up and lead the change toward that exit, and to be patient and mindful of that old world.  It needs to be done with humility, kindness and patience.  And we need to be aware that if either 'side' gets too big for their boots, the opposing 'side' is more than capable of biting back.
If we want to step up and lead, it helps if we realise we don't need Tony Vays' opinion, nor do we need to popularise his (or any other subjective views) that hold back the grander vision; this only gives contrarian views more oxygen and provokes 'fight of flight' responses instead of encouraging our more collaborative nature... All of which results in  the further stymying of progress.  
TL;DR: To succeed, the recipe is as simple as it was at the beginning of Project: Bitcoin (before these talking heads and twitter accounts arrived).  
We simply need to think for ourselves and trust those who see what we see.

Naseem said that a *very* long time ago, and we've moved on since then.
For those oblivious to our history (and the story of bitcoin which is out there in plain sight) here's a brief rundown of some of the best bits.  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.
We know that the CIA called Gavin in back in 2011, that the Federal Reserve, Bank of America and Paypal were present at the briefing.  We know through Snowden leaks everyone who may have had a vested interest in stopping this would have known about bitcoin development since day one (the point at which it *could* have been stopped).  
We know that TOR was built by the Naval Research Laboratory and is funded by the U.S. and Swedish governments.
We know that heads of banks, academics, some of the biggest accountancy firms in the world, silicon valley leaders, facebook/apple/microsoft executives, politicians and even presidents and chancellors of exchequers have basically said bitcoin is awesome and here to stay.  We have seen bitcoin infrastructure (from physical bitcoin premises to ATM's and Debit cards backed by Visa and Mastercard) spreading throughout the world unfettered.
We know all this and yet many fail to see the obvious truth: it's time to stop fighting.  
For those that do see the truth, instead of dragging up tweets from 2013, or thinking bitcoin is embroiled in some kind of silly war, or worse, is some kind of get rich quick scheme... why not simply ask yourself: "what can I build with bitcoin tomorrow that will make the world a better place?".  
Then use the ample free resources the web has to offer and [learn to code]( design, or write a project plan with some friends, and go find some fellow bitcoiners who will help you change the world for the better.  
Beats sitting on here talking about an imaginary 'us' vs. 'them' battleground that was long ago transcended by the technology itself ;)
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:25:51
Well if bitcoiners can get their shit together and not "fuck it up from the inside" as Andreas put it awhile back, then Dimon, China and the very serious businesses of that old world juggling those imaginary numbers that help keep us all fed and clothed... I am quite certain will come to embrace this tech to solve all kinds of problems that leads to the end of that juggling act...  
At the moment they can't do that without taking on the massive risks (as Patrick and others have) that come with backing an unproven tech (and the many unproven actors and businesses operating in the space).
The path to that future and a more stable, reliable bitcoin is something only we ourselves can lay out... It means putting the divisive 2X and BU in-fighting behind us and getting back on track.  
Which *will* happen one way or another since everyone invested in bitcoin - the idea - have way too much to lose to not find the solutions.
We can thank Patrick, Chamath, Tim Draper and the many others that are able to see far into the future and who have been there patiently holding the back line and calmly and rationally speaking truth to power, whilst all this matures.

Pitting us against one another playing little zero sum tribal games - as if the world is one big paper money playground - actually slows down the pace of robust solutions and innovation that would benefit society as a whole.
Having been amongst the first internet denizens back in the days of BBS I can assure you that the internet was not founded on the Gordon Geckoesque ethos of "Greed is Good"; it was founded on the ideals of "information wants to be free."  
You have the internet and the many beautiful sites that define our experiences on it because programmers *shared their thoughts, ideas and code freely*.
Of course that was in the days guardians of the old world thought the internet would have no more effect on global business than the fax machine.  Our ability to share things freely in the light then took a turn when big business moved into the space and started the dotcom frenzy.  
This was the time of the browser wars and the famous anti-trust case against Microsoft and IE (Bill was one of the first to miss the impact Tim Berners-Lee's invention would have on the world, and tried to treat it as any other business).
Indeed, he laughed at Larry and Sergey and said he'd "Give Google a year..." since they knew nothing about business.
Presumably, he would have laughed at Timbo too, for giving the internet to the world patent-free instead of personally profiting from his invention (which would have made Tim, not Bill the richest person on the planet).
What is happening in crypto is an exact mirror of all that but, thanks to the internet itself, it's playing out over a 10 years timespan instead of the 40 odd years it took for the internet to get to where it is today.
Here's a nice HBR piece by Ben Hercht, that he penned back in 2013:

If you accept that Bitcoin is money and that centralised companies are creating money out of thin air, distributed unevenly to a small coterie of people running those mining firms, then it's not that far removed from those behind closed doors deciding the printing press speed.
So you either see decentralisation (of everything including mining) in Bitcoin as a very good thing, or you don't.  I'm not sure if you're aware, but those that like things how they are have their own project run by miners over in a sub called r/btc.  
I think you'll find some nice people there that share many of your views on where this technology will head and they have their own codebase called Bitcoin cash that's trying that very vision.  
That's the beauty of bitcoin - it's code; anyone can fork it and go their own way.
In the end, I, just like you, cannot say with any certainty where all this will head, as there are too many moving parts and way too many variables.  I am however, thoroughly enjoying the journey.  
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:20:07
If they don't, why not explain it to them instead of adopting an 'I am holier than thou attitude?'
Did the internet get to where it is by those who invented it keeping it to themselves?
Of course, I am quite certain there are a great deal many grandmas and grandpapas whom knew what 'fiat' means long before 'irregular' internet folk did.  After all, they invented the concept :D
This US vs. THEM thing outght to stop; it makes bitcoiners sound like a very exclusive club of cackling elitists that 'know better than the rest' and I say that having been here for some 4 years+ knowing that we as a community have never indulged in that kind of hubris.  Largely, because we all know that attitude doesn't lead to us helping others find what we've found.
Rather than making 'regular folk' feel like a 'lower caste' that should be looked down upon, I feel we'd do well to focus our energy on bringing those 'regular folk' up to speed, and showing them just how transformative this technology can be in solving problems they face in day to day life and in transforming their own communites :)

Hey, people said I was delusional when I told my techie friends "there will, in ten years time, be a service where we can listen to all the music in the world for £10 a month" ... "Nothing will replace CD's!" they would yell over and over...  I said this EXACTLY a decade before Spotify launched.  
Before that I was telling people how email would change the world, and people would respond with "you are delusional!" 
Roll on a few decades of me building all kinds of things on the internet and I would be telling people bitcoin would save the world back when all this started...  "You are crazy!  Nothing will replace money!" would be the average response... (although a few close friends who have been on this journey with me now trust my instincts enough to go with them...)
Mark my words.  There will be no advertising or marketing in 10 years time.  None. 
 
Everything will be run by the crowd including money, governments, the products we build and share with one another, and the O/S it all runs off...  
And we'll look back on this last great pre-renaissance struggle and wonder what all the fuss was about.
Like it or not, our destiny lies in the stars, and all this consumerist plastic rubbish and fights over pixels of land and property and ownership over the the minds of others we all got so worked up about, is going to make us all look back on these days in the same way we look back on the days of abject slavery and wonder WTF was wrong with humanity to not see how wrong it all was.

You are assuming the market is rational.
Bitcoin - the idea works regardless of price mechanics.  If it didn't, we wouldn't have gotten everyone this far everytime those who didn't understand the technology jumped on the money train in search of riches, only to panic at the slightest technical hurdle.  
Those who carried this project are the people who actually fell in love with the idea of bitcoin, understand the technology and the problems it was created to solve...  Ultimately, bitcoin is about fixing the world.  And that takes time and patience.

Thanks for correcting me there :)
I'm aware of Bisq exchange and have indeed checked out the awesome looking OpenBazaar 2.0 ;) 
I think that solutions and *real* mass adoption will come from already established players (kickstarter, patreon, ebay, reddit, alibaba, wepay, amazon, stripe, airbnb, microsoft, apple, google, facebook, youtube, dropbox, bittorrent, gmail...) when they feel the tech is stable enough to be integrated into their existing services.
I can't possibly see how any of those established industry players would simply roll over to all this when bitcoin actually enhances their service offerings massively and fixes things like their reliance on advertising revenue.  For old world newspaper sites like the Guardian who have embraced tech, Bitcoin will be a godsend in allowing them to remove reliance on advertising and fund journalists via crowd based tipping of quality content.  
Likewise for UGC we see on reddit and youtube.  I mean, do we expect the whole world to switch to Steem.it or is it more likely Reddit will one day announce they've integrated a (c)reddits alt running over LN that turns karma into real world economic energy?  Such a move would surely render steem.it pretty much obsolete?  
Same with something like streamium vs. youtube.  No-one's gonna' replace youtube, youtube is beautiful and will find its feet just fine in this layer 2, Web 3.0 world...
What happens when Facebook connect, Google+ and Microsoft passport all talk to one another using the same unified Blockstack onename.io type decentralised login system?
IIRC, Google are already experimenting with a Brave browser type experience that removes their advertising across the net and allows you to fund your favourite sites, only thing it's missing is bitcoin...  Stripe love bitcoin... Shopify already support it (and the 50,000+ merchants out there using shopify just need to checkbox bitcoin in their payment settings to activate).
What happens when Spotify / Google Music / Bandcamp create alts that properly reward artists without the need for middlemen taking a cut? 
Perhaps we will see a bunch of mergers and acquisitions as things like OpenBazaar tech are integrated into eBay and Amazon, much like we saw Youtube being bought up by Google in the early days of internet video...  Or perhaps we'll see the teams behind those blockchain initiatives being hired, just as we saw AirBnB hire the entire changetip team.


One simple client that everyone downloads that fulfills all the functionality we need makes sense from both a UX perspective (no need to install multiple apps and learn the different idiosyncrasies of each UX) and also from a security and future-proofing angle.  No more phishing apps or reliance on third party data gatekeepers.


We sure do, that's why we release private betas and do A/B testing on new releases and roll things out slowly.  Gmail didn't suddenly let the entire world in when it launched; it was a case of creating a bunch of invite-only accounts as things were slowly scaled up over the first year before going public.
I do get your point though; it's all a bit messy and chaotic right now with all the different vested interests playing tug-o-war... and it's virtually impossible to say what effect LN is going to have on all this.  
That chaos is not necessarily a bad thing mind, it allows us to keep trying new things as the ecosystem figures out the best approach.  
Key thing is, we all keep our sights fixed on the future, don't get too attached to ideas and the things we've already built, and remember how far we've all come (and why).
Thanks for all your work on OpenBazaar btw, I really do love the concept and I'm sure it will play an important role in all of this.

It's a tiny island where people tend to look out for one another and (largely) trust the mad (crazy) inventors and aristocracy operating in the upper echelons who have all read 1984... which means disruptive technologies like the printing press, internet, contactless cards, phone sim cards that require no ID, bitcoin ATMs... all tend to permeate amongst the masses very, very quickly... without major panic or overly burdensome rules stalling innovation.
They also love technology (they gave us the industrial revolution after all)...  It takes only a few well known, respected 'national treasures' on the BBC to endorse something to sway opinion.   Stephen Fry and Douglas Adams pushing Apple Macintosh back in the day and inventors like Sir Clive Sinclair appearing on programmes like Tomorrow's World helped start the home computer frenzy there, which gave birth to lots of Brits pioneering in the early videogame industry.
Because it's not a country of many different competing states with different interests, laws can also be changed practically overnight to accommodate new disruptive technology.  So there's also a sense that nothing will get completely out of control without there being backup plans in place.
UK was just about the only country on Earth where those in charge could arm 1.5m citizens during WWII (the home guard / dad's army) without fearing revolt from the citizenry.
Which goes to show what happens when a society can trust in the essential good in each other to get through tumultuous changes.  Their self deprecating attitude and ability to laugh at themselves (and each other) is also a bonus.
(If the British prime minister were to ever go on a stage and declare "we are the greatest country on earth" people would grumble about the rain and laugh her off the podium) ;)

And yet, it's the best we've got and still far more representative of the wider group than a bunch of miners and businesses with vested interests in a closed-door meeting, having the audacity to think such a small coterie of men can get to decide the fate of the entire network and its users.
If you use your imagination, what is more interesting than the small sample size (which you make a fair point on)... is how what Luke has put together represents the early seeds of how bitcoin consensus-driven decision making can be done in the future (with everyone in the community: users, miners, people like you - getting a voice)... indeed, this may represent an early snapshot of how all democracies and micro-macro decision making of the future might work when rolled into stuff like James and Susanne's Bitnation via digital voting apps integrated into their forthcoming [Pangea release](

Sure it's good to get a handle on what's happening... But the entire point of bitcoin is to remove all intermediaries.  In that sense, the opinion of people like FB executive [Chamath Palihapitiya]( are going to bring us all greater insight and wisdom into where all this is going, given their tech background and experience in disruptive internet technology.    
It's also worth nothing that people like Chamath backed and understood bitcoin from a very early stage, way before any hedge fund managers and talking heads began doing the rounds at Bloomberg.
As such, bitcoin has never needed hedge fund managers to succeed.  It just needed ordinary people believing in it, with a back line of support by many extraordinary people like Chamath.  And, of course, the economic and intellectual energy of the army of computer programmers who built all this.
I understand it will take time for people to adjust to a new reality where we don't need to seek approval from anyone but the crowd to build and create and self-fund anything we put our minds to... But it's going to happen, just like crowdfunding changed the game for those that used to be the gatekeeper of ideas.
As long as they don't think they can use bitcoin as a tool to build a bigger, faster, stronger version of that old broken system, I'm glad the paper-belt world are beginning to embrace the inevitability of decentralisation, and whilst I'm cautious of some of their motives, I hope some are getting as excited about what all this means for the future as the rest of us are.

Far from being a positive, it kicks in when the brain isn't receiving new stimulus.  Which is why if you do the same job day in day out you will feel bored (and wishing for a future event when you will be 'free') and time will seem to creep by during those work hours excruciatingly slow, since you are literally in a place doing things with your brain you don't want to be doing.  
Similarly, if you go to the same cafe week in week out all the experiences blend into one...  Keep this up for a decade or more, and you will end up saying "my God, where did the time fly to?" since your brain has had no interesting stimuli to separate event timelines.  Little material trinkets along the way can ever pull you out of that.
We escape this treadmill when we enrich life through more diverse environment and experiences.  Time then slows down (in a good way) since your brain is constantly taking in new information.  Rather than thinking "wow didn't time fly!" you are actually amazed by all the things you managed to accomplish and places and people you got to see in such a relatively short amount of time; months and weeks seem to last for years, because the amount of change you have witnesses *is* years when compared to a 9-5 existence with little new stimuli.  
Time is all a matter of perception in the end.
 &gt;He stayed there until he died, having no effect on the people who put him there to begin with?
Yes that's my point.  Because he challenged the normative social influence of the time he was deemed heretical.  Far better, had such a brilliant mind been embraced instead of feared.  
There are many geniuses of our past who were way ahead of the thinking of the common masses who feared reprisal.  Charles Darwin was one, had he not found a partner he may never have published his theories on evolution since they too, were so radical for the established order of the time.
Yet Darwin serves as a great example of how when we nurture radical thinking instead of fearing it, it leads to the betterment of all society.

Or, any given crypto currency for that matter, including cryptos that no-one even knows about that aren't readily available on public exchanges and would have far greater levels of anonymity baked in.

Banks will and *should* continue to exist in this new world, but they are going to have to pivot and embrace the changes that come with having an immutable world-wide public ledger that can no longer be cheated, and the tsunami of automation that is set to disrupt everything from accounting to the way ordinary people trade and exchange global economic energy.

I believe in the wisdom of *well informed* crowds which is completely different to 'mob rule'.
Empirical evidence tells us certain words *are* divisive.  However, I do not believe in suppressing or banning them any more than I believe burning of books or censoring websites is a solution to ideas we as a group have moved beyond.  
Ultimately, it is for individuals themselves to ask when and where language that may cause offence to themselves or others should be moderated.  And to treat others with the kindness and respect we ourselves expect from those around us.
We are each a product of a random cosmic dicethrow and the environment and conditioning that lead us to the beliefs we hold.  You could just as easily be that person you 'oppose' were it not for a different set of random events that lead to your existence.

Ayn's ideas (that we are all selfish) are currently being turned upon their head.  The open source movement currently sweeping the globe is the complete antithesis to her vision and shows that collaboration over competition is what benefits us all the most.
Bitcoin is a prime example of a community that thrives on collaboration in areas that would normally see competing businesses trying to out do one another (not that there isn't plenty of that too for those that haven't quite yet jumped fully down the rabbit hole).
As for morals, they're a constantly moving and evolving tapestry of inter-subjective belief structures.  What was 'immoral' in the time of Alan Turin (who committed suicide because of the way society regarded homosexuals) is not necessarily true today.
It all comes down to a geo political system that was built on John Nash's zero-sum games in the end.  A system that still saw tribes separated by borders and flags as opposed to one human family where divide and conquer no longer applies.
The internet of course, changed the rules of the game.  Web 3.0 and decentrlisation will go even further to realising the early pioneers of this space and their beautiful vision "information wants to be free"

The article 'blockexplorer.com' refers to originates from [Ngoi Lao Dong]( which, like any Western rag, is powered by advertising and comprises of opinion pieces.  It's affiliated with the [Vietnam General Confederation of Labour]( but is not an official government portal.
Further, the decree (which has actually been in effect since 2014) says *may* be subject to prosecution which is entirely different to *will* be subject to.  Translation of that is, investigators leaving enough wiggle room to fine an organisation they feel is doing dodgy stuff with bitcoin (such as people exploiting others through ICO's and fraudulent get-rich-quick schemes off the back of this technology).
We can look at the same Ngoi Lao Dong newspaper to dig even deeper, to an article published there just **yesterday** about FPT university accepting Bitcoin for tuition fees (they officially announced this on Friday).
See: 
Note how an official government announcement is yet to emerge, and is not expected until 2019.


This is all corroborated by a coindesk article [here](




The conclusion to all this: Far from being illegal in Vietnam (as the knee-jerk headline implies), bitcoin appears to be in the same grey area as it was in when the original decree was drafted in 2014.
TL;DR: Until we hear from an *actual* official source you may as well be linking us to an opinion column in Entertainment Weekly.

Thanks for taking the criticism onboard.  I think we have to constantly remind ourselves just how early we all are in the adoption curve and tread gently with those that are new to all this.  It took many of us hundreds (if not thousands) of hours of research to get to where we are.  We can't expect old paperbelt folks who can barely use skype to begin to grasp all of this without our help :)

This.  And even if he were a core dev, the team is so globally distributed now and just so huge, it would not make any difference if one (or even a dozen devs) dropping out.  In fact it happens all the time - the 200+ scientists contributing are largely popping in and out in their spare time.  Few have to do this full-time.
Further, even if core did have to close for a month and stop working, bitcoin would continue to function just fine, since the network can never be forced to update a nefarious code push.

Ahhh it's always been a constant battle, this tech thing...  
From rocketry and genetics to computers and the internet, it's often the smartest people who invented the flipping stuff that are having to think 10-20 years ahead as their ideas start to go mainstream... This is the catch-22 when you invent technology that can be used to both free and enslave humanity.
As the demon haunted world catches up and thinks "oooh you know those rockets you invented to take us to the moon?  What if we use them to blow the moon up instead?" ... those smart people have to invoke Backup Plan  they drafted 5 years prior to deal with that specific threat model.
In the end, it's not unlike foolproofing your house against toddlers who have a proclivity to stick their fingers into live plug sockets.

The moment I realised Trump was quite possibly going to end up being president was during the [Whitehouse Correspondents dinner in 2011](
Donald had been banging on for years about Obama's birth certificate and the Birth Video (Lion King) sketch mocking him was perhaps the final straw.  We see a man broken, whose understanding of how the world works (and his control of it) had long ago been usurped by a group of intellectuals that saw him as nothing but an aging dinosaur on the verge of extinction.    
And so the liberals pushed him too far; instead of building bridges with that old world, they cut it off and used their considerable command of language, intellect and humour to beat him to a pulp... We see a man left seething in anger and hate... which he bottled up and released upon the world...
One might argue that Adolf Hitler experienced the exact same abuse; here was a man that wanted nothing but to make art ([his paintings were stunning!]( but was considered to be a faillure (this is the problem when we conflate artistic output with monetary worth).  
We can imagine him sat there in Austria, begging on the streets where he tried to sell postcards whilst elites looked down upon him with revulsion.  Perhaps, like at that correspondents dinner with Trump, it took just one banker looking down upon him and saying "You're postcards suck!" to tip him over the edge...
Adolf was a vegetarian and greatly admired Churchill and [Charlie Chaplin]( (hence the moustache).
He had the wrong ideas of course: eugenics (making everyone the same) wasn't the way to unite humanity; multiculturalism, diversity and celebration of our similarities as opposed to preconceived differences is the only way we can collectively come together and go explore the great unknown that awaits us beyond the stars.
That includes accepting that not all bankers are greedy; not all trump supporters are racist; and not all bitcoiners are shining knights in armour.
As always, with a little help from the wisdom passed down from our ancestors that have seen all this before, this crazy little species of ours, will figure it all out given enough time ;)

Every cloud has a silver lining.  As a result of BREXIT a youth that were largely disenchanted with politics and didn't bother getting up off their arses to vote in the referendum were given a swift, sharp, shock, such was the level of complacency on the 'left' that Brexit would never happen and that "there was no point in voting".
Roll on a few months then to the General Election and we saw that youth galvanise en masse via the internet to the point they had a no. 2 pop song and a Theresa May vs. Corbyn iPhone game that reached the front page of most downloaded apps on the iTunes store.  They showed the world that no matter what hate-fuelled campaigns right wing printing presses / attack ads bought on facebook tried to do to turn the populace against itself, it was no match for a well organised citizenry that came together around grassroots internet campaigns.
The resulting 'stalemate' between red and blue has lead to a complete change in personnel in parliament and a newly energised, more youthful and more diverse set of MP's able to take all the things they've learnt in the new world (and their superior grasp of technology) and teach all the old folks how that tech may be applied to fixing problems.  You may be surprised to hear that most councillors don't even know how to use Skype, such is the huge disconnect between two warring generations that do not understand each other.
We also see a house of lords who are relentlessly pressuring parliament into bringing the voting age down to 16.  
Coupled with the next wave of youngsters bought up on the borderless internet coming of age, the next election should see the dark age we've just gone through all but over as we embrace new technologies, voting platforms and ideas borne off the back of 'the wisdom of well-informed crowds'.  Crypto and blockchain will of course play a major role in that, which is why so many London Universities have been all hands-on-deck leading research into this (which these youngsters are all learning).
BREXIT also bought the old red and blue guard together around new cross-party ideas that actually fix some of the causes that lead to brexit.  And, most importantly, it has lead to the *actual* ordinary citizens of Europe coming closer together; in a way it's reminded us all just what a beautiful *idea* the EU is and can be, and made us all think about what we *actually* stand to lose if we don't figure things out.  
Which we will of course, just as we did in a post WWII that lead to the creation of the NHS and the Welfare state.

That doesn't make sense for multiple reasons. 
1. [U.S Marshall's auctioned]( off some 44,000 bitcoins to Tim Draper and others years back and we know law enforcement agencies already have wide access to bitcoins for use in criminal investigations and blockchain analysis, with proper issuance procedures in place.
2. It would be more cost effective to simply buy the coins on an exchange than shell out tens of thousands of dollars for mining equipment and the on-going electricity costs.  A regulated exchange purchase will also leave a cleaner audit trail so they can account for the transactions.
Only way it makes sense is if they wanted to create newly minted coins with no blockchain history, for some reason.

That's the beauty of the bitcoin protocol... it's code.  
If we believe and agree through consensus that this would have been Hal's wishes (perhaps with the caveat Satoshi does not make a claim otherwise)... then there is nothing to stop Core, with a very simple code change, from making that beautiful story a reality.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:32:32
Don't we also have to ask what 'value' and 'wealth' is?
Since we have no idea how much 'money' there actually is in the world, nor can we stop it being duplicated on a whim... clearly it can no longer be regarded as a useful measurement tool.  And, since it is only our inter-subjective beliefs holding together the illusion that money represents anything of real value at all... we need to begin to question just what it is in the world and each others lives we truly *do* value, why we value it and just what actual real wealth is.
If we do not figure that out as this new technology begins to permeate the masses, are we not doomed to making the same mistakes with bigger, faster, stronger technology?  
Is that the true roadblock to progress in this space and impasse we see between 'big business' and the architects of the internet who believe information wants to be free?  And is that the secret ace up the sleeve of those who understand that grand vision?  i.e. does it even matter what 'big business' attempts to do if it's not onboard with the moral arc that 'Project: Humanity' ultimately bends toward?
When the whole fiat illusion further unravels and faith in that old system is lost... how do we avert the kind of collapse the Roman Empire faced when it too needed to debase currency due to people no longer believing the collective delusion holding that system together? 
We live on a planet where it is now cheaper to be deploying green energy than it is fossil fuels and yet fossil fuel companies still attract more 'investment', diesel cars still roll off production lines even though we have the tech for electric and even hydrogen vehicles; we're ok with society paying for-profit defence companies to produce missiles and bombs even though we know from history diplomacy is the only thing that can ever lead to true peace; warehouses sit in third world countries where rice, cocoa beans, medical supplies go to rot because speculators have gambled on futures; we throw away a third of food in the West, whilst a third of the world lives close to starvation...  All because someones 'investment' portfolio has attached some kind of value to a profit incentive that says these crimes against humanity are *profitable* and therefore 'someone else's problem'... so detached is this value systems disorder from true reality... and that reality is that we live in a world of abundance, where if this profit incentive were eradicated, flying cars, rockets of discovery, space elevators and all the other incredible things we could start building *tomorrow* are less than a decade away if we were all rowing together in the same boat...
Presumably if we were to step away from the pretty bar charts, the ROI sheets and shortsighted hedonistic pursuits... we can all agree to sharing the same grand ontological objectives: fixing the environment, exploring space, creating inner-worlds through VR, ending poverty, disease, war, wage slavery and creating a better world for future generations we can all be proud of...
If the EU experiment (for all its faults) is anything to go by it shows us that vastly different cultures and the needs of people *can* be balanced and with that balance, trust can be established between those cultures and their belief in a greater collective unity... So much so that freedom of movement between EU borders has been made possible less than a few decades from the iron curtain and Berlin wall coming down... the idea that any country in Europe would ever go to war with one another again is preposterous for most living there...  
We can all likely agree then that this freedom of movement is a worthy objective to set for the entire globe; and that bitcoin, immutable record keeping, and trusted identity systems offer our best hope of achieving that grand vision and fixing the value systems disorder that has held humanity back for so long...  Once we begin traveling, and seeing the world as one planet we realise that is *our* food and medical supplies rotting in warehouses, *our* children living close to starvation and that it is very much *our* problem, no matter how distracting meaningless pretty green arrows on FTSE 100 charts may be telling us otherwise.
Which brings us back to the question: What is real wealth?
Is it the stocks in oil companies, rotting warehouse food, cheap plastic trinkets that we know would ultimately lead to our demise?  Or something much more valuable than any of that?  If we go back to that moment we climbed down from the trees and first tamed fire...  What brought us together to sit around those campfires and enabled us to grow communities that lead to the invention of language, cooking and the wheel?
It all goes back to that currency which humans have been exchanging for millennia... and gave rise to our ancestors surmounting impossible odds and carrying out incredible feats of bravery that evolved our societies to where they are today...

The global public ledger, the fact bitcoin can't be counterfeited, makes all of those things much much *harder* to do without leaving a digital trail.  It's actually much easier for law enforcement to track bitcoin flow than anonymous cash payments.
I think have to think about the world bitcoin is going to exist in rather than thinking of the world it currently straddles.  
War, poverty, hunger are currently at all-times low, as is violence as a whole.  Hard to believe but, it is unlikely in the future we will conflate bitcoin price with fiat value.  Rather, it will be seen as a measurement of economic energy and resource usage that pushes this great species toward a world of abundance and mutual collaboration where UBI, automation, and huge public good infrastructure projects finally get to thrive on a global scale.
It requires a leap in consciousness, but then so did the eradication of abject slavery, civil rights, the agricultural and industrial revolution and, indeed, envisioning a world where the internet itself could free the world's information on an egalitarian basis.

Exactly my point.  Now, unless you're a computer scientist and coder you can't possibly *understand* the technical nuances of what's going on in the background any more than a coder might be able to work out how to fix a broken down car engine...    
So, are you gonna' trust the auto repairers that have a whole fleet of mechanics that specialise in your car engine and to date have a faultless record with their repair history, or are you gonna' take it to the solo mechanic that's already had to call technicians from the other garage for mistakes he's made on the one engine he's been in charge of?
Personally, I'm taking my car to the mechanics with the faultless history who do what they do for the love of the job, and trusting they'll do a good job of getting it fixed up... because at the end of the day, all I wanna' do is have a car that can get me from A &gt; B whilst I concentrate on the job I am actually good at and enjoy doing (which is coding).

This. 
Ideally, Bitcoin would have had a few more years in quiet, under-the-covers development so those who were building the tech (and indeed those who helped shape many of the internet websites and services we all enjoy today) would have had more time to think deeply about how to properly develop such a disruptive technology in a calm and measured way around Satoshi's ideas of a decentralised exchange, global marketplace and unified wallet (all running through the client).
The "hive" Satoshi feared being kicked was not law enforcement per se (who we know through Snowden's slides would have been closely following bitcoin development from day one) but big business and an 'old guard' ignorant of the internet and fearful of what such a transformative technology might mean for the world.  
As a result, bitcoin then saw the predictable fallout: lots of panicked, knee-jerk reactions from old world politicians, economic 'gurus' and the descent of big business that has lead us to the world we see today of centralised commission taking SQL payment hubs, exchanges and a complex array of different wallet implementations that need not exist, that has lead to big business trying to shape this tech through old world board meetings (vis-a-vis NYA).  
There's an interesting passage in Julian's "When Google met Wikileaks" where he introduced bitcoin to Google President, Eric Schmidt, and was under the (surely false) impression Eric was yet to hear of it.
Why false?  
Well, if [Nathaniel Popper's account]( is correct, then we know one of Google's chief security engineers - Mike Hearn - had already been working on Bitcoin in his 20% time at Google, and gathered together a working email group of some 400 Googlers and been regularly reporting back to co-founder Sergey Brin about the project.  And don't forget that this is the very same Mike Hearn who issued a ["giant fuck you"]( to the NSA upon discovering (through Snowden's slides) they had been trying to spy on traffic running through Google's fibre optics (which Mike patched).  
*"I've spent the last ten years of my life trying to keep Google's users safe and secure from the many diverse threats Google faces… But after spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google -- one of the greatest things to arise from the internet -- seeing this, well, it's just a little like coming home from War with Sauron, destroying the One Ring, only to discover the NSA is on the front porch of the Shire chopping down the Party Tree and outsourcing all the hobbit farmers with half-orcs and whips." — Mike Hearn*
Mike then went on to work on bitcoin full-time only to rage-quit when he couldn't get consensus on the scaling debate (that's not how bitcoin works Mike, but we love you anyway you crazy man :p).
I digress.  In many ways that Wikileaks announcement and the haste to get bitcoin out there to the masses before the code base was ready (and governments had had the time to fully ingest and understand the technology) set back the very mainstream adoption bitcoiners sought because of the chaotic way the ecosystem then had to develop as a result of the unwarranted publicity, hacks and crazy businesses that descended throwing money at bitcoin (and missing the point of it all).  In addition, important net neutrality organisations like the [EFF]( had to drop their support at the time because of the announcement.
There is no doubt that Julian has brought many important issues and egregious abuses of power into the light that the world needed to know, but if he truly understood bitcoin's transformative capacity and how it is set to free the *entire* of humankind from the dark ages we've just gone through, then he would stop using it as a stick to provoke that very same hive.
This latest tweet - dripping with hubris and schadenfreude - does nothing to help bitcoin and the many ordinary people who stand to benefit from the technology, and those old world predatory business practices we seek to transcend.
As with Dimon et al, we'd all do well to stop giving oxygen to emperors with no clothes who are ignorant of the technology and bitcoin's history.  And to remember that bitcoin is not a get wikileaks (or anyone else) rich scheme, it's a save the frakkin' world scheme.
Luckily for us all, bitcoin - the technology, will be ambivalent to all of these petty human affairs... 
She will still be here tomorrow, strong as ever, because at her heart lies the most diverse group of scientists and humanitarians on the planet who understand that **bitcoin is for everybody**.

Let's face it most people who *own* bitcoin don't really know how it works.  I say: "well that's fine, you don't know how your Visa card works behind the scenes, but you know how to use it."
It's still very early days yet, there are no user-friendly UX implementations that *just make perfect sense* to people across all demographics.  That's OK, they will come in time.

Since this is every bit a social revolution as it is technological there is plenty to be done.  Just being here on reddit and spreading good information, steering clear of price discussion and 'get-rich-quick' scheme talk and instead focusing on the transformative role bitcoin could play in your local community *is* contributing positively to the project.  
There are 350,000 subscribers here now, up from 10,000 when I first started posting here.  As such, this subreddit is more important than *any* of the other bitcoin information gateways out there and it needs strong voices able to steer discussion away from some of the more negative and divisive talking points.  We need to constantly remind people how far we've come and why bitcoin was invented in the first place.
If you are keen to get involved in offline outreach consider joining meetups in your area, or starting your own if there aren't any... Maybe host a bitcoin film night that you can invite friends and/or local business people and techies to.
If you are interested in art/music/writing there are plenty of opportunities for getting involved on that side too, even putting up posters in your local town gently introducing people to bitcoin is something you can feel good about doing.  
Mostly though it's just about enjoying all this and not getting caught up in arguments or debates that will, in the long run, have no detrimental effect on where bitcoin is heading any more than internet detractors could effect the free flow of information the world wide web lead to.

You're right about that responsibility thing.  Perhaps it's down to the failure of many in this world, to see how our own footprints are connected to everything and everyone. 
"someone else's problem" is the defacto response when you question any individuals behaviour, or suggest that maybe their own failure to step up and live the values they expect others to follow, is part of the problem.  
Case-in-point: I will see people sat at Starbucks moaning about government and wage slavery and big oil, then in the same breath treat their fellow wage slaves serving them coffee like shit, not give a crap about the take-away plastic straw and cup they're drinking from (which came from the big oil companies they're complaining about) even though they could have asked for a porcelain cup and taken it back to the counter with a smile when they were done drinking... instead they expect someone else to clean up after them (both at the landfill site and the litter-strewn table they leave behind for the waiter to fix)...
This is the very same demographic of people who will moan about the trash in their town, then toss an empty beer can on the floor declaring "not my job!"
Bitcoin doesn't fix any of that of course; it cannot teach morals, manners and kindness; it merely enables those who do see what we see, to move economic energy and social capital accrued through good behaviour around the internet (and globe) faster, and without the kind of freeloaders (albeit higher in the food chain) I mentioned above feeding off that energy without giving anything back.  
Reputation accrued through Bitcointalk and Web Of Trust systems were early alphas to how this is going to roll-out, but really none of this is any different to a high-tech version of how trust was really the base currency of villages of old (cheat people, create a mess, and you were ostracized from the community).  It was only when cities appeared that better systems (religion, law) were required to deal with [Dunbar's Number](  As we witness the internet creating one gigantic borderless global village then, the next logical step is something like bitcoin to more accurately measure that all important base currency of trust that underpins all this...
On a long enough time line then... Bitcoin being linked to a decentralised Blockstack-type global network of trust and identity management, means we eventually evolve this network of *people* into something that - through social capital and good behaviour - incentivises everyone to behave more kindly toward one another, and that 'lash' is supplanted by the 'carrot'.

This is a very fine analysis. 
I'd just add a few things Andreas Antonopolous raised in a talk:
There is nothing quite like having real world economic value anchored to new technology to get ordinary people quickly up to speed (he was referring to encryption and safe custodianship of private/public keys, but same will be true for people learning how to safely split after a contentious fork).  
 
Uncertainty may result in a temporary dip in 'value', but we'll end up with a technology worth a whole lot more.  
Most of the 'true' holders have been here since Mt. Gox crash.  It didn't dent our belief in the technology or faith in the consensus protocols one bit. 
As with BCH pre-fork, we may have actually already seen the worst of the price panic.

Just because they are Russian does not make them crooks, please provide sources and cite your evidence for such claims. 
The City of London has incredibly tight finance controls on companies operating out of there, so it's about the silliest place to move to if you intend to defraud customers.  


Don't disagree, meanwhile if I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere (where there's no bitcoin infrastructure or merchants) and I want to use bitcoin, owning my own keys isn't going to help me one bit.  Whereas owning my own Bitcoin debit card will, and, by extension, help the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole since it's actually being used out in the wild in a place where I would otherwise have had no other choice but to go to an ATM with my fiat debit card. 
 Same goes for Western coffee shop and 1st world purchases.
That does not mean I have to put all of my bitcoin on the debit card or that I don't control the keys of a cold wallet, any more than you have to move all of your bitcoin onto your mobile phone wallet.

Exactly.  This is the whole point of bitcoin, which many have missed.  And it is why it all has to happen so slowly.
Not that it will seem slow in hindsight, if we were we to fast forward a decade to when everyone on the planet measures real wealth in 'bits', people will look back and say "Well shit, didn't that happen fast!" unaware of the gargantuan work carried by such a small group of crazy, thoughtful citizens from some quiet corner of the internet.
To know the future is saved when so many live in fear and doubt is both a blessing and a curse sometimes.  But it sure does feel nice to carry this little secret smile with you everywhere you go, radiating the certainty that everything is gonna' be alright, however this beautiful future unfolds.
How lucky we all are to be living in such a time and to be able to say we were a part of all this :)

They are definitely to be commended.  Worth remembering they were the first mining pool in the world, and took more risks than many in backing bitcoin early on, and obviously have more experience in the space and technology as a result. 
Allowing users to choose which chain is also perhaps a small glimpse into the future of mining, when it is fully decentralised and consumer level mining chips are in everything from smartphones to fridges.

Patience.  In order for that to happen there needs to be a new wave of infrastructure development.  We're kinda' existing in two worlds right now: you have old Layer 1 tech revolving around myriad wallet implementations and exchanges, all straddling the onset of a new world of Layer 2 tech that makes much of everything we think of bitcoin as it stands today, practically obsolete.  
Some companies in this space will pivot, some will have teams bought out by tech giants, some will shut up shop and move onto something new. 
Ordinary people will start thinking in terms of mBTC when some of those Layer 2 solutions have amazing UX experiences everyone understands (and become the defacto standard) for customers, web giants and merchants alike.  
The chaotic way this burgeoning ecosystem had to develop in order to remain anti-fragile will begin to find order and develop industry standard open implementations, and the kinds of competition we've seen in this space mimicking tactics of old world companies will turn into grassroots collaborative initiatives that solely have user experience in mind.  
For that to happen we need to get over the next few protocol hurdles ahead and wait for the tech to start rolling out and for governance protocols to mature (we can't realistically expect things like highly technical scaling debates to be decided over twitter polling in the future).  Different working groups will need to be established that pull on more of people's strengths and things they are passionate about, instead of expecting everyone in this space to carry myriad different hats to keep the good ship afloat.  This will in turn mean the kind of bitter disputes we've seen holding back development are (mostly) a thing of the past, and we'll see some AMAZING ideas driven by the crowd finding oxygen as a result of those working groups seeding new initiatives in a more collaborative and nurturing environment.    
When ordinary people start feeling the ramifications of all this in day to day life, we'll be in a world where everything is billed in terms of 'bits' and we'll start seeing an equalisation in the actual value of *things* untethered from geo-political old world measurement tools such as GDP borne of internal economic policies.  Since everyone will be working and selling goods for bits, connected to a global crowd-driven 'tradenet', the exchanges and price speculation we see today eventually becomes redundant.  
Conflate that with micropayments and machine-payable-web being driven via some incredible leaps in the way we think of internet monetisation, and all of this starts to make sense.  Heck, you will even see entire online multiplayer game economies creating alts that run through the bitcoin blockchain via atomic swaps network, opening up an entire new 'virtual' industry every bit as real (in terms of real-world economic energy) as material world economies.  
I would not even be shocked to hear you will be able to get VR bar tending jobs in the future, working in someone elses game world. Ha!  I mean, people already spend 1000's of hours 'playing' inside games like WoW to earn virtual gold they then sell for 'real world' currency.  Indeed, I think the first bitcoin ATM in the world was actually inside the game Second Life (you could convert BTC&gt;Linden Dollars IIRC).  
I guess that initial Layer 2 adoption process will take 2-5 years at the current rate of technological advancement we're seeing.  
In the meantime, think of yourself as one of the very first people who got into the original iPods back when most of the world only associated the word Apple with a type of fruit :)

Not how this works if you can see beyond the status quo (which I though most bitcoiners could since it meant seeing beyond the old fiat system to even think about getting involved in this world).  Here's how things likely pan out (but I have no more of a crystal ball than you do so take it all with a pinch of salt):
1. 14nm Vega home miners recently unveiled in Dubai begin going on sale soon which mean domestic mining is now becoming a reality (no more mining cartels).
2. PoW change can easily brick existing mining cartels should it be necessary.  Bram Cohen (inventor of Bittorrent) recently released his proof of space eco friendly mining whitepaper.  Bram is working with lightning labs and Adam Back.  We're also yet to see what kind of impact BitFury's 12 Petahash BlockBox units might do when they're turned on and directed at 1x.
3. Domestic appliance giant Midea are looking to embed mining chips in consumer devices.
4. Noone in their right mind is going to move substantial bitcoin holdings to one guy coding in his basement with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo (by virtue of his company thriving on middleman commissions) when they have the option of leaving coins with some 200+ of the smartest coders on the planet (including teams in MIT, Stanford, UCL etc...) who have been safeguarding those funds since the very beginning.  
5. The biggest holders are 'bitcoin believers' that, like Core, have been here since the beginning and taken substantial risks (way before companies like BitPay arrived)... Think people like Simon Dixon and Max Kaiser...  They have no need to move their bitcoins.  Non-replay protection just makes it even more risky for the less tech savvy crowd to move their coins, so they'll just wait it out too.
The result of the above is a few months of longer confirmation times, but a bitcoin protocol that is just as rock-solid security wise... As the ecosystem adapts, we will actually see more people using Lightning and apps like Zap with instant close to zero-fee transactions happening which in turn strengthens the bitcoin ecosystem longer term by meeting the scaling challenges even faster with *real* scaling solutions (Lightning can support billions of transactions, 2x cannot).
We could expect the price to remain stable pre-split, just as we saw with BCH (most will be happy to get the 2X alt coin dividends and say goodbye to all the fuss that 'side' made).  Post-fork panic over, we'll likely see another rally (just as we did with BCH).  
Confidence restored, eventually it becomes more profitable to mine on 1x due to the price increase and superior security features / ecosystem trust 1x participants have built up over the last 8 years and the future begins to look very bright indeed.

You could be saying the same thing about the tenderloin in San Francisco, or the inner-city slums of London or Birmingham (I have lived in and grown up in some of them) hence I qualified my statements above with "not without its problems (like all countries)".  
And btw, what makes you think I'm white / non-asian exactly?  
I happen to be from a working class family, so don't also make the false assumption I'm from some privileged collegiate background, or out of touch with the common struggle of ordinary people; it just makes you look like a privileged presumptuous little know-it-all, that jumps to discriminatory conclusions before properly weighing up the available evidence and facts... 
All pretty big assumptions for you to make given about the only thing you can even *reasonably* glean from my post is that it sounds like I *might* be from the UK (which does not mean I'm necessarily Caucasian, given the huge ethnic diversity in Britain) don't you think?

I'm still learning all this, it's as complex as bitcion itself was to get my head around.
Probably looking at Q2/3 2018 before any significant announcements from myself, and it would be targeted at a very niche subset of reddit (perhaps some other team or reddit themselves will build something like this too).  
Nice thing about what I'm developing though, is that it will work for posthumous comments, so historic karma and toxicity data will be back-converted.
I love the idea of how a whole bunch of people from say, India, who have spent years on reddit positively contributing to reddit communities, will suddenly find they have a huge boost in economic social mobility as soon as this goes live, simply for being nice people.

This has never been technical, it's been political.  If it had been technical segwit would have been live in a week, instead of taking 2 years.
Please stop thinking of bitcoin as means to move cheap bits of money around, that's what Layer 2 tech is for.  Bitcoin will be a settlement layer that represents the most secure blockchain on the planet.  
Micropayments, atomic swaps, machine-payable-web, global ID via blockstack, smart contracts via rootstock and myriad amazing things currently running in stealth and/or yet to even be conceived of will be the things that take bitcoin mainstream.  
Anyone who fails to have the imagination to see into this future are those stuck in the status quo of thinking middleware like bitpay is needed to replicate the very old world intermediary problems that lead to the need for bitcoin in the first place.
If you don't like that vision, if you don't like the idea of 4 billion people on the planet getting access to the global economy via all this, why not go to bitcoin cash who are trying something different?
Or you could choose to forget the scaling argument, since it's basically a red herring...  and instead learn about the opportunities that LN and Layer 2 tech opens up if you're truly interested in helping us use this tech to build a better world for everyone.

We are a way off yet in terms of tech infrastructure for bitcoin being used as a currency instrument.  At the moment it's serving a trusted store of value, over time Layer 2 technology, will be scaling bitcoin up to allow for billions of transactions, which the underlying protocol is not yet capable of supporting.
There are interim solutions such as the [Bitwala Debit Card]( that allow you to use Bitcoin wherever Mastercard of Visa is accepted and the current scaling solutions (Segwit) are bringing transaction charges down a great deal which means it's still a good currency for using online. 
The best explanation of all this came from facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya a number of years ago.  [Youtube Video Here](
*"I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fun, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. Because what you're talking about right now is, for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right? The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government. It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina. Everywhere you have currency pressure. Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. And then, after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism."*
If you are a Westerner, as always the advice is "do not put in more than you can afford to lose" and understand bitcoin has far greater ambitions for the world than being a get-rich-quick scheme.  In the meantime, we all need to excercise patience as we await those Layer 2 tech solutions which should start rolling out over the next 6 months to few years, where bitcoin will start flexing its utility as a superior payment instrument to legacy systems.
Hope that helps, and happy hodling!

Sure.  Scores are hidden for a period to discourage hivemind thinking which happens when a sub goes from 10k to 340k subscribers in such a short period of time...  
People being 'censored' are often those driving home idealogical points and weighing in on arguments that simply cannot be settled via reddit, largely because the vast majority of the people here are *not* computer scientists and do not have the highly technical knowledge needed to actually participate meaningfully in the discussion.  
Even of the tiny majority of us here who *are* computer scientists, most of them, such as myself will tell you even they don't know the code enough to be able to say for certain what the best way forward is.  I am astounded that since core has only around 200 programmers in the ENTIRE WORLD contributing to the repository that so many people in this debate think themselves qualified to have an opinion.  And that goes as much for CEO's of blockchain companies that haven't the relevant knowledge as much as it does people in here.
It would be like me going into a Kit Car subreddit with a bunch of my programmer friends thinking we could usefully contribute to a highly technical discussion being held by mechanics on how best to upgrade a car engine they all spent years building from scratch... it would not be long before the mechanics that founded the subreddit politely asked us to just stick to posting pictures of us driving the cars they built for us...  And if we kept on railroading their high level discussions and further set back the engine upgrade, they might be perfectly in their right to ask us to leave... After all, that subreddit they founded?  Well, just like the car engine itself, they built it from scratch with love, wayyyy before we ever arrived.

You can hold a balance of BTC in the Bitwala Wallet (and up to 50 alts I believe).  Haven't got one myself, so not sure if they debit straight from that when you spend on the card or whether you have an option to move over into fiat.

Not for me to say what you guys do.  Personally believe it to be a waste of energy that can be used more proactively embracing and supporting people capable of transcending those old laws, which are incapable of keeping up with the rate of technological innovation in this space. 
Go back to the Viacom vs. YouTube lawsuit that ended in the judge basically saying "YouTube is too important for the world for me to allow this to go any further... You guys are clever enough to figure it out yourselves without the law stepping in."

Having a goal is not the same as having an 'end' goal.  Bitcoin can have no end goal any more than the invention of language, the printing press, the plough, the aeroplane, or the internet itself had an end goal...  All we can seek to do with these inventions and discoveries is to strive to keep learning and discovering more, whilst making the world a better place for those around us.  With perseverance, you will find fellow wayseers who share the same goals as you... 
For guidance, we can [look to the giants who came before us]( whose shoulders we now straddle.  They too went through much of the same struggles, albeit with different technologies and problem sets that had to be surmounted.  
It's through this application of humility, kindness, patience and forgiveness that we can best learn from the mistakes those ancestors that came before made.
Only then can we begin to see that this entire journey is not about racing towards an imaginary finish line but about enjoying and being in love with [*the journey itself*](
All we can do then is breathe deeply, put that [Pale Blue Dot]( into perspective when you begin to doubt yourself, and have faith that if you remain true to your morals and your word, the rest will follow, and trust those you find along the way will be there to pick you up if you fall down.

Hence blockstack and the unified id / payment gateway that allows users and website architects to begin to massively rebuild the business models that hitherto had 'market inefficiency' baked in.  
You need patience for those things to arrive, otherwise you're just creating the same thing that solves nothing at all except move payments around faster, which isn't the inherent problem that people like AirBnb, Youtube, Google and many others are busy trying to solve...  The problem, is with the internet itself that had to work around the obstacles placed on them by the payment incumbents that has meant user data has landed up in all kinds of centralised datastores instead of being encrypted in a data layer the user herself is responsible for.
But hey, sounds like you know better than all of the people that have been here since the beginning of all this (and by *all this*, I mean the beginning of home computers, the internet and the new technology of bitcoin you have just begun playing with).

I agree with everything you're saying, and of course Blockstream paranoia is not inline with reality; especially if you do some cursory research, read into the philosophy of Blockstream and the history of people like Adam, and the groundwork he laid in the last few decades to make all this happen.  Their "Can't Be Evil" network philosophy is incredibly eye opening and exactly the kind of pioneering mindset we need in this space if we are to take this to Layer 2 tech and beyond.
Not to mention the fact they are one of the few companies who are pioneering *actual* real scaling solutions in line with objective science, as opposed to trying to hack the current protocol to fit around v1.0 business intermediary services who see bitcoin as something stuck in time.
It's also my understanding that investment money they took came with very strict "hands off, this is a science project" caveats.
All that said, I am aware of how belittling those who haven't this breadth of knowledge only provokes a fight of flight response... which does nothing to help us spread this knowledge in a calm, rational way and eventually change the hearts of minds of those people.  We just prolong the bitter rivalry between the two 'camps' which slows down everything meaning coders are having to do FUD fighting on social media instead of the coding work they would rather be doing.
Of course this is all about the ecosystem figuring out the optimal path forwards and it in many ways everything is as it is meant to be.

Thanks for your permission :p Good to know.


Don't assume that I am male or think that labelling people 'cucks', or whatever other little boxes and labels you want to put on others somehow makes your arguments and ideas more worthy of people's attention.  This simply tells us you get your kicks from belittling others and the feeling that comes with being part of a 'clan'.  Which is the very antithesis of thinking for yourself.
It's funny, people used to use the word 'nerd' and 'geek' in a derogatory fashion to put people who read widely and were passionate about technology and learning down, just as you are using the word 'cuck' here to put people down in the same fashion.  Of course, nowadays most people in society see intelligence as something that is to be aspired to.  
Gone are the days where alpha males pumping their pecks attracted the best mates in the gene pool.  Today it's intelligent, thoughtful 'nerds' like Mark Zuckerberg and Sergey Brinn that give humanity greatest hope.  So much so, the Oxford English Dictionary definition of the word 'nerd' changed in recent years to reflect the newly positive status of people who were once, in the past, made fun of by the wider group.


I'm not sure why you bought Mcafee into this particular discussion, but I'll bite.  
No-one is calling into question whether John is a 'good guy' or saying that he doesn't have good intentions.  But do be wary of that old adage "the worst evil in the world is committed by those with the best of intentions."
Now what is bitcoin?  John's definition of bitcoin is one that sees miners controlling the network and a small coterie of businessmen controlling those miners via emergent consensus and various other 'big blocker' ideas.  Ok, that's cool and the very reason those with a differing philosophy are free to go take the core bitcoin code and create a new version.  Indeed, I fought very hard with people on here - including people within Microsoft - for the right for John and others to do just that.


Being a greying techy myself who has been working with computers and the internet for the best part of 30 years, I was well aware of John's story and was following it all *as it actually happened* and remember being very worried for him and breathing a huge sigh of relief when he got out safely.


That's the thing about 'heroes'.  I've been fortunate enough, through the things I've done and non-profits i've supported to meet many of my heroes, and you come away with the realisation they're no more special and have no greater insight into this thing called life than anyone else does ;)  


I'm a computer coder and a social activist.  One of the first things I did with bitcoin (before John had even heard of it) was integrate it into a website for a non-profit protest album.  I have used it to fund and launch artists and musicians and pumped any profits I've made into furthering the cause of ordinary people looking to do amazing things in this world who just needed a leg up.
I, like many in this space, am interested only in bitcoin's capacity to help humanity build bridges and get to the actual moon.  We can only get there by working together.  Speculation and price is irrelevant to those long term aspirations if we truly want this technology to set us all free.


I have stood up for the underdogs and the downtrodden in this world every time I have had to.  My morals are most closely aligned with Einstein when he said: "I believe that Gandhi’s views were the most enlightened of all the political men of our time. We should strive to do things in his spirit: not to use violence in fighting for our cause, but by non-participation in anything you believe is evil."
As such I've stood up to homophobia, racism, sexism, those opposing net neutrality and the massive disparity of wealth that has seen so many at the bottom of the social strata in recent years struggling to survive and make sense of the world.  I've given my house and offices over to the homeless, helped ex-Iraq veterans and even spent months with British Nazi party supporters to get a better understanding of why people turn to hate and violence when scapegoatism rears its ugly head.  And I became a vegan wayyyy before it was popular or trendy.  I chose veganism because I'm a scientist and, like Einstein (who was a vegetarian) understand that if I truly care about the planet, animals and my own health it was the only sensible thing to do. 


Can't disagree with you there but if we are to agree that bitcoin is money (since money is just a measurement of wealth and human energy) then we must also agree that when bitcoin goes mainstream it too could be used for unethical purposes if we don't agree on a framework of global transparency that is egalitarian across the board.  For many people like myself who have been here since the beginning (I was one of only a handful of bitcoin believers in the original London group, which now has 4000+ members) - bitcoin is not about simply smashing the doors down on the old world, but working out how we build bridges between the old and new so that everyone gets to come out of this feeling secure about their future and where things like the military industrial complex and the shock and awe doctrine of old patriarchs can never be repeated.  
In that respect, money was the simplest problem to fix; the rest of the changes rippling through society right now will take more time, just as major cognitive and technological revolutions of the past (such as civil rights) took time for the masses to come to terms with...  After all, the luddites sought to smash the agricultural farming equipment that would eventually set them free from slavery.
I meet many people through this strange passion of mine - from old world businessmen, VC's and politicians to youngsters coming into the internet and programming space for the first time...  Some just don't know what to do since the technology is moving so fast.  I've about 20 whitepapers that now need to be completely rewritten because of the new possibilities that are opened up with lightning network.  That's OK, there's no rush with any of this.  
I think some of the best advice I have given those people I've met who want to help bitcoin but are struggling to work out how they fit in has been: "Go buy one bitcoin, forget about it... grab a guitar, and travel the world for a year."
Whilst we all get worked up about these things, it's easy to forget there's already a very beautiful world full of amazing people out there for those willing to step out of their comfort zone and go explore this amazing planet.  
Wealth, money... at the end of the day, it's all relative.

Of 141 nations, the UK is no.2 on The Global Innovation Index (USA being no. 5).
So yeah it's not too surprising.  It's similar to when they came up with the idea of the 'common wealth'.  Do not forget the Brits were forced to debase Sterling (GBP) after WWII because America insisted they pay interest on war loans.  Something the Brits spent 10 years trying to explain to American politicians was 'morally bankrupt'.  
Screwing up the strongest currency in the world (backed by silver) was the only thing they could do to avert complete disaster.  They finished paying those loans off in 2006.  I wonder, how many old school British politicians rubbed their hands together when 2 years later Satoshi's paper came out?  Since, in essence, it represents an opportunity for the first government that 'gets it' to return to some sort of true sovereign currency as strong as GBP backed by sterling silver was back in the day. 
P.S. They also invented the world wide web and gave it to the world for free instead of patenting it, and were the first country to really hammer home the importance of computer science as a subject, pushing a massive government campaign to issue free schools to computers back in the 80's.  
They're much like a small internet startup – the country is tiny, well organised and can move incredibly quickly and change laws overnight when new technology comes along.  They're also massively culturally diverse and the gateway to Europe, and of course the progenitor race of what is the Universal language (English).

They're all totally inconsequential in all this?  Just like they were when the UK sent that first text message in 1993 and gave the world wide web to the planet patent-free (Tim Berners-Lee was a Brit) and, ya know, before that, started the industrial revolution itself.

The investment most needed in all this, is cognitive energy and diversity of groups of people and ideas; it is more about sharing those ideas, teams and talent for rebuilding the world and fixing the many problems we have as societies than it is about thinking of ROI and short-term monetary gains.  That requires truly engaging people from all disciplines in a proactive manner.  
Europe will most certainly play an integral part in the future of bitcoin and getting back to a more equitable, shared "common wealth" as a species.

Would be great if we could all think twice before linking to dodgy news sources.
See the following debunking of this unsubstantiated rumour: 
TL;DR: Vietnam has not banned bitcoin, it's in exactly the same state it has been since 2014.  
In the meantime, the Vietnamese government have assigned relevant ministries and agencies to draft a legal framework for the management of digital currencies.  It is expected that by 2019, that framework will be completed in the first step, which means that from now until the issuance of the legal framework, electronic money transactions will not be regulated and/or protected.

If bitcoin has a beautiful fairytale ending it is surely this:
*Before his death, Hal penned a letter to the UN, bequeathing 10% of all bitcoin to a "World Restoration Science Fund" which is set to automatically release upon Bitcoin reaching a specified value.*

It's not government control, it's corporate control and commercial banks loaning money out of thin air...  Have you learnt nothing from Equifax breaches, HSBC money laundering scandals, Libor rigging, sub prime mortgage loans, HFT bots on Wall Street... None of that was instigated by politicians, other than those few that helped or were in the pocket of lobbyists...
Money *is* the control.  Future generations will look back on these times of greed and excess and laugh how we thought that debt, inflation and money as a measurement of wealth that was long ago decoupled from *actual* wealth could sustain itself.  How can we use money as a measurement tool when we don't even know how much money there is in the world?
Most politicians don't know enough about how money works to do anything but nod their heads to those 'experts' in the economy that long ago showed us this system of control they told us they had a handle on, is now out-of-control.
China have done nothing bad.  Indeed, they let the great bitcoin experiment run without intervention until ICO's got out of hand (unlike the U.S. that made it all but impossible for exchanges to launch without significant MTM capital).  I hear China exchanges will come back up once they can show they have proof of reserves and aren't operating a fractional reserve system.  
Can coinbase show that?  Or did they and businesses in this space who thought bitcoin was just another product to be exploited get in bed with VC's too early?
The only adversaries stopping this tech from truly propelling our species toward a type I civilsation are the greed, hubris and ignorance of actors in this space who missed the point of bitcoin.  Long term, those stuck in that old demon haunted world will have no impact on where all this is heading.
As Andreas said awhile back *"Governments can't fuck bitcoin up.  Only we can fuck bitcoin up - from the inside.  And if we do?  Guess what happens...  The very next day, all those invested in bitcoin - the idea, get right back up and build Bitcoin 2."*

I try to see the good in folks from all social strata and remind people that bitcoin is for everyone.  There can be no more "us" vs. "them" any more.  We need the whole of humanity onboard this rocket ship.
I feel sorry for people who haven't travelled, whose idea of experiencing another country is to jet off to the tennis court of a Hilton hotel for 2 weeks, only to return back to a grey office with grey walls and climb the corporate ladder to riches...  Only to find when they get to the top they end up saying "well... now what?".
But I feel just as sorry for people who wish they had the luxurious material trapping those groups 'appear' to benefit from.  That's not where true happiness or self actualisation lies.  
Bitcoin offers us the opportunity to redress that 'wealth' imbalance and free both groups from the illusion that has them chained to the [hedonic treadmill](

We really ought to stop linking to articles from finance journalists who know nothing about computer science talking about the most mind blowing invention since the internet itself, an invention that has seen us - for the first time in human history - solve the double spend problem, as if it is somehow in any way shape or form comparable to tulips or gold or *ANY* technological innovation that has ever come before it in all of human history.
There's so much out there now in tech journals on a daily basis being written by people who really do grasp this, we do ourselves a disservice by linking to anything even vaguely finance related.  
Ask yourself before reading any of this "is the author a scientist or engineer?" if the answer is no, understand what you are about to read is like opening up FAST CAR magazine and expecting a person who normally reviews cars to be able to pen a worthwhile essay on The Hypertext Transfer Protocol simply because the word "transport" makes them *sound* at least vaguely qualified in the subject matter.

I have sat in deserted wastelands next to people with nothing but the milky way above their heads and a campfire to keep warm, singing songs and jumping with joy as they point out shooting stars... and in those moments realised money and luxury are meaningless.  It's all relative...
I've jumped off mountains with locals with no material objects but the paragliders they saved up for, and soared with eagles and witnessed the most majestic sunsets over the gleaming ocean, only to land to see locals share fruit they've picked on the climb up with me on the beach... without expecting anything in return but a thankyou and a smile.
And I've walked the flashing, noisy neon casinos of Vegas and seen millionaires chained to fruit machines day in day out as they wait to die...

Well said.
And of course the biggest issue is: 
**THE SCIENTISTS WHO ACTUALLY BUILT AND CODED BITCOIN WEREN'T EVEN AT THE NYA MEETING!**
So the only people on the entire planet with the actual technical expertise (who have been here since the beginning) were absent from what was an entirely technical discussion.
This would be the equivalent of the VC's who helped get the money together for a Nuclear Reactor, meeting up with the janitors who do a very good job of maintaining the building, to discuss the intricacies of whether they should run the reactor at twice the normal speed, against the advice of the pesky nuclear physicists who have told them on multiple occasions they're not sure if it's a good idea.
"Ah but!" the VC's yell "We invited the scientists and they didn't turn up, so we just went with our gut.  Don't worry, the janitors are cool with it."
I can only conclude the entire thing is a gigantic social experiment being conducted by some genius [think tank]( to work out which people in the community have let money, ego, power and greed go to their head, so that we may shake them out of the rocket ship before bitcoin is used to actually power *real* Nuclear Reactors.
Of course the funny thing is, it really is a social experiment, since they're never gonna' be able to redact any of their actions from the story the internet will be telling to future generations.
I can only reiterate OP and remind them all that "It's OK to be wrong", we've all been wrong about bitcoin a million times.  
I'm sure everyone would only be too happy to be sitting on the same rocket ship with them a year from now laughing about all this, as we add it to the ever-expanding list of stupid shit we've all done over the years out of love for this incredible project that is writing history on a daily basis.

Carl Sagan (who said those words) was a white, American scientist and educator.
"Xenophobia is the fear and distrust of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange." (from: [Wikipedia]( 
It is not a phenomenon that is exclusive to white people (In the 60 or so countries I've travelled to in this world, I have met many 'non-whites' who have initially exhibited xenophobia through inbuilt fears of other cultures).  
Of course nature itself loves diversity, which is why the more genetic diversity we have and the wider our cultural exposure, the stronger our genes become and the less likely we are to experience the [hedonic treadmill](  Hence the old adage "variety is the spice of life."
We know this from science, since groups that don't have wide genetic diversity are more likely to suffer from debilitating illnesses, hence inbreeding leads to all kinds of negative genetic mutations.  Fortunately, we know through epigenetics that many of these mutations can be overcome with the right kind of nurture and environment.
Since science also tells us we came from one common human ancestor ([mitochondrial Eve]( it's fascinating to think that at the very beginning of it all it appears we literally all came from the same Mother.

It will be hard for *anyone* (internet new or old) to move into that zero cost model, as we're seeing with shapeshift and bitpay who just replicate old intermediary commission structures.
However, with Stripe backing bitcoin payments, and the new unified payment API google are working on, bitcoin acceptance will eventually come down to user choice and sites will be basically agnostic to the payment choices made by those users.  This provides a nice slow on-ramp to the new shiny bitcoin world without threatening incumbents or non tech savvy users (like old folk) who will be slower to embrace all this.  It also means you won't see insane price volatility (in both bitcoin and the fiat world) who will get time to slowly embrace and understand the new opportunities.
Machine-payable web and micro-tipping, removal of the reliance of ads to fund websites will be *the* big thing, not *decentralisation* per se.  That's an over hyped buzzword banded around far too much nowadays - decentralisation is not a magic wand that fixes everything if we don't simultaneously tackle the many socio-economic problems bitcoin was built to address in the first place...
We all want a world where there are no intermediaries at all, but that will require all kinds of layer 2 tech and, like the bitcoin protocol itself, will need the entire industry (internet and crypto) to come together and think about universal ID gateways built on top of blockstack and the like which can roll out across all web properties.  Only then can a truly trust*full* transparent ecosystem start emerging from all this.  We then begin towards playing *whole*sum games instead of *zero*sum.
We also need to think about how the rising 4 billion without access to the global economy factor into all this.
Definitely exciting times ahead as the internet starts beginning to look a lot more like Tim Berners-Lee and the original architects always envisaged it could be.

@_date: 2017-10-07 19:43:45
I'm going to post this again so that we can avoid spreading knee-jerk, reactionary panic...
P.S. This game has never been about who has the most 'money'; it's always been about who has access to the best information.
DCG is a lot more complicated than you might realise.  Think of Barry as more of a classic VC that has hedged his bets in all this and invested in loads of companies in the space, even those with different visions of where Bitcoin should go, in the hope some of his 'bets' will eventually pay off.
Further, just because companies have received investment from DCG does not mean they are contractually obliged to follow any visions DCG have in balancing the different needs of those companies with regard to their input over the bitcoin protocol.  
Case-in-point: both Ben Davenport and Adam Back (Bitgo and Blockstream respectively) have come out massively against 2X. 
My biggest concern with DCG are with companies they've *acquired* as opposed to invested in.  
Specifically coindesk, given that they have the ability to lead the narrative by virtue of being a publisher.  But even coindesk are set to be disrupted (as are all media properties of the future) via crowd-led news outlets like Wikitribune and, of course, by Reddit itself via the scrutiny of the crowd.
Not a lot can be done behind closed doors in this space without there being a leak somewhere, since so much of the *real* work *has to happen* in the open (IRC, mailing lists, BIP's etc.).
If you want to join the dots, I would say look to the actual companies in this space and the kind of friends they have (and belief structures those friends subscribe to).
If Nathaniel Popper's account is correct, then there's an interesting group of people here that met and discussed bitcoin a number of years ago, which perhaps explains why companies like Xapo are pro-segwit 2x.
In particular, pay close attention to those in this space who are of the "Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes its laws" persuasion. A lot of this comes down to ideology, ignorance of the open vision of this technology, and a 'business as usual' attitude.  
And, worse still, a failure of newly endowed businessmen and women who have never built anything on the internet before who have no idea about the mistakes made by corporations of the past who tried to take control of the world wide web in the exact same way they are.
The difference this time around is those who did make those mistakes during the world wide web revolution, and fought for net neutrality so you might enjoy sites like Reddit, are now all grown up.  A lot of the people involved in bitcoin from the beginning have been running successful internet startups for the last few decades, and are slowly figuring out how all this can fit around what they've already built.
Bear in mind **it's possible for these two competing visions to exist side by side**; there is no reason 2X and coinbase et al couldn't provide a nice little safe Paypal 2.0 esque walled garden akin to Apple's App Store in the interim... just as right now Paypal and Bitcoin are co-existing nicely (Stripe, Braintree for instance).  
It's imperative both 'sides' stay calm and don't threaten each others different visions by doing **egregious stuff like forcing a contentious hard fork that doesn't offer strong replay protection**, or **mixing up tickers which will confuse ordinary everyday people** which we all have a duty of care to look after.  Clearly 2X can attract the more cautious institutional investor side and "App Store" grannies, whilst 1X can be the big, bold "Android" innovator with crazy visions of space stations and decentralised mining which the more tech savvy and younger generations can get involved with without needing to be wet nursed.  
Atomic swaps mean those grannies and their grandkids can still interact regardless of which side of the fork either party bought into.  So the future is bright for both 'sides' if **B2X do the right thing and make sure they do a responsible fork we can all get behind and champion.**  
Failure to do so will end up riling up both 'sides' continuously and open us all up to silly DAO style hacks as each 'side' gets prodded (instead of constantly peer-reviewed), which only makes alts like ethereum more attractive for people entering this space and further sets back innovation.  Better we all look after each other and focus on the security and future of both blockchains (and yes, the future of DCG companies building cool stuff on them).  
**We all need to take a step back and recognise the more important role we are all playing here in helping solve much bigger socio-economic issues like the environment, war and poverty.**  Everyone in this space gets to create solutions for tackling those problems in really exciting ways through this technology when it's ready, but only if we're all playing nicely with one another and pushing our energy in the same direction.  We all want to create a better world for future generations, we all want to be proud that we played a positive role in helping shape that world during a period in history when the masses were crying out for people to step up.  Time then, to start building (and mending) bridges and focus on those much bigger socio-economic objectives we can all agree on, no matter what side of the fork we stand on.
Don't forget too, there's been zero announcements from Y-Combinator, Google, Facebook, Reddit or any of the websites that most shape the internet landscape... so, in the long-run, DCG and all the companies they have in their portfolio (and the tiny userbase they all command in comparison) have little say in where all this ultimately leads... It takes just one announcement from Google to say they've integrated Layer two ready 1X bitcoin into Android pay and Gmail to completely change the rules of the game... 
It's perhaps up to DCG companies then to think about pivoting away from their focus on commission and payment gateways since the current internet giants surely already have Layer 2 solutions up their sleeves (Blockstack alone changes everything in terms of decentralised identity and data storage - which is another Barry Silbert portfolio investment btw).
I'll leave you with Facebook executive Chamath, talking about bitcoin back in 2013... A guy who, I believe - along with many in silicon valley - actually *gets* bitcoin, why it was invented and where this open source technology is truly heading if we move our attention away from 1st world coffee problems when this in-fighting finally draws to a close in November...

Not at all.  Most have API's that will open up even more (see Google's open payment gateway they're working on).  
What most of the youngsters new to this whole internet thing miss is that the generation that built the internet are the generation that came up with the very concept of API's and began opening up the entire internet in the first place.  It's a generation that always believed "information wants to be free." it's just we all had our hands tied until bitcoin arrived by the various business interests and the terrible advertising models that were needed to fund web infrastructure.
There's gonna' be lots and lots of failures borne of new kids on the block not understanding the blood, sweat and tears that have already gone into building web 2.0 so you may enjoy sites like reddit.
Lots of whitepapers, ICO's and copycat sites will result from the 'gold rush' of newcomer 'hares' desperate to carve something in the internet from all this, but lacking a truly visionary grasp of the adjacent possible it all leads to.  
Meanwhile, the old internet 'tortoises' who have been here since the beginning and have nothing to 'prove' will exercise due care and patience as this nascent tech evolves, before they once again disrupt the world with a whole plethora of mind blowing solutions most haven't yet conceived of in this space.  It's their greatest art after all and they are now masters at it.
Just as with the dotcom boom and bust, I and many others who have been playing on the internet since day one witnessed, lots of people will think in hindsight how silly most of these early naive attempts were when LN, Blockstack and unified Global ID starts making more sense to the entire world (including the 4 billion without access to the global economy).
The good news is none of that work is lost in terms of the skills and concepts being learnt, any more than the web design skills learnt during the dotcom rush were lost longterm.
The hardest thing to learn in this game is to walk away from something that you've worked really hard on (an idea or project) when it becomes clear it's not going to work.  Gets even harder when you've promised VC's the moon and fear failure.
Master walking away, and learning from those who have been here before, and you will eventually have a "Eureka!" moment where your idea will truly be original and properly satisfy a real world problem in a clever way no-one else in the world has yet thought of.
Like I said before, AirBnB's success is down to Paul telling them their idea would fail.  
Had they not had the foresight and humility to listen to Paul's wisdom and pivot their vision, we wouldn't be here right now having this discussion ;)

Precisely, and what have Erik, Jeff and those other old world bitcoin companies *done* exactly, except replicate middleman payment gateways running over the same centralised SQL data hubs that we already had in the old world?  
Sure, Jeff *talked* plenty good about putting blockchain in space, whereas this company actually *did* it.
Similarly Jeff and Erik *talk* decentralisation plenty good, but when it comes to actually pushing pioneering solutions that enable it (Lightning, Rootstock, Blockstack) it's an entirely different story.
Different strokes indeed.

This is it.  Doesn't make times like this any less stressful for those who built bitcoin - the idea.  
It's kind of like having someone you love very very dearly getting into trouble and, whilst you know she has enough good people around her to eventually get her home safely, not knowing *exactly* how or when they will navigate the hurdles ahead means lots of sleepless nights (even though you know it's irrational to worry).
I would add one small caveat: *not all banks are created equal.*  A few of them are as relieved as the rest of us that - through bitcoin - science has found a way out of the madness.  As unlikely as it may sound, there are many working in the light at the 'highest' levels on the same side of the chessboard as the crazy ones who built all this, and they too are figuring out how to get our baby back home safely.

The same reason technologically advanced humans send emails instead of faxes; use SAGE instead of Paper Ledgers; Debit Cards instead of stuffing wads of cash under their mattress. 
Go back a little further and I'm sure laggards of the time were scratching their heads as to why we no longer needed [Tally Sticks]( to keep track of everything :D


People would say EXACTLY the same to me in the early 90's when I was running around telling everyone how awesome email was.  And truth is, if you know how to use your banking app, there's no reason you won't know how to use bitcoin, since it just acts and feels like ordinary money, only faster and more satisfying (both in terms of knowing you are not entrusting some third party with your wealth and private financial data, and in terms of being *actually* faster).  Heck, you could even just get a bitcoin debit card and not even worry about the app side of things.
And yup, I think (at least in the UK) the vast proportion of the populace today have heard about bitcoin.  It's constantly in the news here (both on TV and in newspapers) so it's impossible to ignore, just as home computers and the internet were impossible to ignore once everyone began talking about them and getting excited.
Case-in-point: only a few days ago I was about bitcoin to a friend outside a cafe, only to see a complete random stranger sat on the table next to us (overhearing our conversation) pull out his phone and ask us what was the best wallet to download, and what we thought of Xapo (he'd ordered a card with them and installed their wallet).  This was just an ordinary guy from Spain on holiday here with his English girlfriend.  
Walk a few roads down from the cafe we were at and you will see a bunch of bitcoin posters someone has pasted on an empty shop window, every other lamppost in town has a bitcoin logo stuck on it; the meme is everywhere.  We have seen the main bitcoin group in London grow from just a dozen or so people back in 2013 to over 5,000 people today and counting.  This sub is seeing user growth of 1000-3000 per day, coinbase seeing similar numbers with wallet signups.
All that considered, and when you see two of the biggest accountancy firms in the world accepting payment in bitcoin and installing bitcoin ATM's in their main HQ's, it's clear we've gone well beyond the 'novelty' stage.

Thanks for all the links, that certainly helps in giving people the information they need to make a decision.
I don't disagree with the longerm goal of bitcoin existing with no intermediaries, but for the moment it has to cater to the needs of less tech savvy consumers and/or people who want the flexibility of being able to use bitcoin in the world as it exists today.  Coming off the fiat-ramp completely via a bitcoin debit card *is* good for bitcoin, especially when coupled with stuff like BitWage (at least in the mid-term) **as long as you can be sure the company your supporting understands those longer term aspirations** (i.e. when trusted decentralised identity systems are in place.)
**The more important point of the post is to show how through W-Pay, Wirex are already ahead of the tech game when it comes to thinking about Layer 2 solutions** and they are worth applauding for that; also it appears their management team is full of techies (as opposed to ex-bankers and finance magnates).  
Further, they were not a signatory to NYA.
At the end of the day it's not for you or I to say where people put their bitcoin or choose how to use it.  Most haven't got anything to hide or fear from KYC, providing companies like Wirex aren't trying to influence the protocol development and are safeguarding customer data, so we can avoid the kind of breaches we saw at equifax.  
We can see Wirex are highly tech and security conscious from their [blog post on Segwit]( and their thinking on the W-Pay architecture.  
As such, **I would rather a company be focused on security and have poor customer support but get amazing app reviews** (which Wirex have) because it tells us they have mostly invested energy in the technology side.
It's for individuals to make their own minds up and draw their own conclusions on all this.

Well an analysis of our DNA, shows of all the countries in Europe we do indeed have the most genetic diversity.  I read somewhere there was a 70% match to Tutakanhem, so we were likely descendents from Egypt, considered the birthplace of humanity.  The library of Alexandria (which was burnt down during the Roman Empire) was considered the internet of its time.  
Probably our mastery of the oceans is responsible for this too and the fact that it's a tiny island with no natural predators or disasters (earthquakes etc.) meant we had basically a very small amount of space where everyone had to get along.  Which is why laws change so quickly here and the adoption of new technology like bitcoin can happen overnight and why things like communism never took hold here.  Britain doesn't have bloody revolutions, it has quiet 'reformations'. 
My favourite city after London is Brighton, it's perhaps the most multi-cultural city on the planet and the only one to not get bombed by Hitler during WWII.  This is because he wanted the Pavilion for one of his world headquarters.  Which is ironic, because the Pavilion, built by Prince Reagent was a shrine to multiculturalism (it featured chinese artwork and was itself based on an Indian temple).  In WWI it was used as a hospital for Indian war veterans that helped the British army abroad.  


That's not true.  The Chinese old people love their kids to get 'white' boyfriends and girlfriends.  Indians love to mix with Brits (hence British people's favourite foods are Indian and Chinese).  Maori's love to mix with white New Zealander's.  Spanish, French, Polish, Romanian love coming to the UK and sharing their cultural quirks with the Brits and contribute to our music, art and culture.  


It is not about forcing everyone to mix, it is about allowing people to be *free* to mix if they want to, and about not fearing those who are different.  It is very beautiful to travel and to see other countries and cultures and all the crazy things we humans do from the tomato throwing festivals in Spain to paint throwing in India during the Holi festival of Colours...  If we forget skin colour and look deeply into someones eyes, or we simply just listen to beautiful foreign music on a beach somewhere abroad looking to the stars and the moon, it becomes very very clear we are all just stardust on the same spacehship Earth trying to figure it all out together..

It's basically a common misconception / confusion amongst both press and the masses at large as to whether we define millennials by the time they came of age or when they were born.  
Since Canadian author Douglas Coupland was the first to coin the term Generation X (Millennials == Gen-Y), it would be his original classification that best serves as the inter-generational delimiter here.  And, indeed, is used by Silicon Valley, thought leaders like Simon Sinek and even Goldman Sachs (see their emerging theme radar report below).
So, just another example of 'scores of reporters' propagating  bad data from poorly understood research, in the same manner we see glaring mistakes in bitcoin reportage time and time again :D

You may not believe this, but without the support of some of the good banks out there, bitcoin would never have gotten this far.
I keep trying to explain to everyone here that the fight is over and that we'd do well to concentrate on the very cool stuff happening.  Some people though, have no idea what to do with themselves when they are told they no longer need to fight.
At the end of the day, doesn't matter what I or you think, we are each responsible for our own sovereign wealth.  Not for you or I to tell people what to do with their bitcoin.

This is all about code.  No matter how much fiat is ploughed in by s2x businesses, there's nothing monied groups can do any more to game the markets now that exchanges are so widely distributed...  since they're up against 1,000s of the best coders in the world with sprawling online networks of collaborators and fellow scientists.  These coders have no 'leader', no 9-5 working hours or bosses to answer to; all of them are capable of hooking into the various exchange API's and spinning up trading bots (and sharing that code with one another) to move the market in whatever direction they choose as soon as an agreed upon meme or hashtag goes out across the network (should they see fit to bother playing these silly zero sum games and get seriously organised).  It literally takes more time to sign up to the exchanges and get the API keys than it does to code the trading logic.
In such a scenario: as far as I can evisage, any s2x pump attempts would then just lead to 1,000's of those bots eating their way through the pumps and pushing money to the other 'side' and, over a long enough timeline, the hashpower will follow as the Bitcoin price moons yet again with the bots eventually stabilising things so nothing gets out of hand.  It all comes down to psychology in the end, and we all feel *instinctively* safer knowing core - backed by science, peer review and experience - are steering the good ship.  Markets will of course reflect this sentiment, no matter how much dark magic the other 'side' tries to throw at BTC to manipulate those core instincts we all share.
Also, don't forget all the 'quiet ones' in silicon valley who watch from the sidelines as all this plays out.  They have more funds and computing resources than any of the new pretenders in this space.  Heck, even Apple's Steve Wozniak bought in ages ago.

We must all realise that bitcoin *is* money and that as such, both old *and* new money (from DubaiCoin to Zcash to Bitcoin) can be used either to propel rockets of *destruction* to further fuel the military industrial complex or, instead, be deployed to fund rockets of *discovery*.  This discovery can be as much cognitive as material of course.
It's incumbent upon anyone in this new field of science to understand that fiat is used as much for good as evil...  If it were not, we wouldn't even be having this conversation.  Reddit was built with fiat, as was Google; Spotify; [Band Aid in the 80's]( the [Occupy movement]( solar farms; the [World Food Programme]( the company that built the laptop / PC you peruse reddit on and, yes, even the internet and bitcoin itself, was built on a measurement tool we use to gauge human economic energy and planetary resource usage.
The problem is not with fiat or 'evil' corporations (which are just a group of people with a common purpose) but with a system that was predicated upon the 'greed is good' Gordon Gecko mantra of the 80's.  That mindset propogated by Edward Bernays and others, directly lead to everything from the judicial system being eschewed (remember the woman that successfully sued McDonald's for $1m because her coffee was too hot?) to the same system of greed borne of the profit incentive being just fine to poison babies in Africa (remember the Nestle milk controversy in the 80s?) as long as shareholders profited somewhere along the line.
This meant that those companies who hid their economic measurement tools in the shadows (which lead to Panama leaks, Stratfor etc.) got to 'legally' cheat the system, fund things like land mines and drug cartels, the black diamond trade, which ultimately required the 'good guys' to do the same bending of rules to offset all the damage being done.
Bitcoin brings us all to a world where we can forgive both 'sides' for past mistakes as long as we all come to the understanding the future unfolding will have no more dirty secrets.
The wonderful science educator and 'wonder junkie' Jason Silva has been pushing the idea that we need to redefine the definition of Billionaire and reframe it as someone who is capable of positively effecting the lives of a billion people.  These are the ideas that are capturing the attention of a newly energised generation of youngsters who grew up with the internet and tools like facebook that do not see a world of borders and tribes.  It will be their ideas and their energy, nurtured and guided by wise elders (of all ages!) that will have most say in the trajectory of bitcoin - the technology and, indeed, the species itself.
[Jason Silva's video New Definition Of Billionaire]
The UK's chief science advisor and the Bank of England refer to this as "glass governance" where every single payment in and out of government becomes transparent.  Layer 2 tech offers us each the opportunity to be transparent without sacrificing our basic privacy rights to third parties who will exploit that data.  Wheras blockstack and lightning offer a new way of doing things which allow good, honest people and good governments embracing the idea of "glass governance" the ability to thrive from being open.
There's coverage on this link: [The UK’s Chief Scientific Adviser and Scientist Recommends Bitcoin’s Blockchain]( - see for link to the government report and video introducing some of these ideas.
Shapeshift / Bitpay and the myriad exchanges with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo are of course *themselves* bitcoin third parties with centralised SQL databases holding your private data and will be open as abuse and hierarchical stewardship of your data as any incumbent banking system that does not safeguard data integrity.  
As I intoned in previous threads here, this was never intended; everything was supposed to run through the client requiring no fallible human counter parties.  It didn't got that way because of Wikileaks bringing the project into the mainstream before the people invested in bitcoin - the idea, had time to develop these ideas further.
TL;DR: Fiat isn't the problem, human greed is the problem.
I am glad you appreciate the optimism, as there is much to be optimistic about.
As [Winston Churchill]( once said, "The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty."

Yes, certainly for the world coming (machine payable web, billions of micropayments reinforcing smart contracts, IoT) a universal block time that isn't subject to misinterpretation would make sense to keep everything in lock-step.  Would be interesting to see if people start thinking in terms of 10 minute time slices.  "See you in a block!" may become a thing, hehe :)
As for the broader ontological perspective: I think we'll start going back to a more natural circadian order that is less and less regimented by the clock and the need to be in a physical place in space and time.  We forget there was one a 'time' before clocks and timetables and production lines.  
With UBI commonplace and machines doing much of the grunt work, humans will be much freer to start thinking about more creative uses of time and energy without an alarm clock snapping them out of the more contemplative states of mind needed to get the best out of each other.  A
Without the panic of 'missing the bus' or 'time running out' we end up fostering a much more collaborative and nurturing environment for everyone where, paradoxically, because there is no 'rush' to get things done, we end up actually getting *more* done and in a much more enjoyable and mutually beneficial way.  
Hence the old adage "more haste, less speed."

You should think of it more as leader*ful* than leaderless.  It is this many brains with equal share of voice and equal 'power' that leads to the ecosystem discovering the optimal solutions as opposed to one glorious benign dictator guessing at those solutions and forcing the rest to follow.  
Yes, this can take longer, but it means we are not at the mercy of any in-group being corrupted or wresting control.  Everything is scrutinised and subjected to peer review including the ideas themselves, without anyone needing to worry about upsetting the 'guys at the top' or 'speaking out of turn'.
It also means people are free to come and go as they please so no one 'leader' suffering from burn-out (or simply having a bad day) needs to carry the group. 
And there absolutely is a clear direction.  We have satellites in space, atomic swaps, rootstock and blockstack and myriad projects in the mix yet to be announced, not to mention thousands of university students and academics all now dedicating time and energy into working out how all this can be used to build new systems.

Many of the original exchanges and wallets have already pledged allegiance to core as being BTC no matter what NYAers do, so either Coinbase can follow them or risk confusing their users, and face the absolute nightmare that will be the technical support requests that result (and since Coinbase have the less tech savvy users of all the exchanges it really would be a nightmare).  This will drain company morale, capital, resources and result in a hugely negative impact on client confidence.  
Imagine, as a user, you go to bitcoin.org, learn all about bitcoin and decide you are going to go buy some.  You hit Coinbase, buy BTC, then try to send it to your daughter (a hipster) on vacation who has been using bitcoin on her mycelium wallet regularly for the last few years... Let's say she has called you up in dire need of financial help as she has lost her bank card and wallet and needs to check-in to her hotel before she loses the room...  
"Aha!" you think, bitcoin will save the day here, you're a proud Dad having finally got into bitcoin years after your tech savvy daughter told you you should get involved (maybe you're Jamie Dimon).  So... you send your daughter freshly purchased Coinbase BTC only to find it never arrives with her, because Coinbase and a few other NYAers - in their grand wisdom - decided to confuse the tickers, and in doing so confused poor old Daddy Dimon in the process...  Just when Jamie had just started to believe in all this, Coinbase failed him (and bitcoin) at the last hurdle...  Boo!  
Bad for bitcoin, *really* bad for Coinbase because they've just lost a customer and got a crappy rating on Google as a result... and it's *really really* bad for stranded daughter Dimon who is no longer gonna' be able to check into the Hilton via Daddy's bitcoin transfer ;)  
Coinbase junior devs, too, will no doubt feel compelled to side with the unfettered coders building cool stuff and having fun with Layer 2 and coming and going as they please whilst contributing to core... and so even the commitment of the amazing coding teams holding coinbase together who have done us all so proud over the years may come into question if it looks like the other 'side' is having more fun.
Indeed, only yesterday we had a team leader from an NYA dev team in this subreddit bemoaning the fact their company had to make preparations for supporting 2X.  None of that bodes well for the future security of funds held in these NYA web properties that rely on the passion and belief of good coders pulling long hours because they believe in what they're doing.
What NYAers have failed to see then, is that both Coinbase and 2X devs are going to need massive help and support from Core devs and Layer 2 coders if they want to keep up with (and make sense of) the ultra fast-paced changes we are all soon going to witness happening when the 1000's of coders who have been quietly working on all this begin rolling out truly groundbreaking sites and services taking advantage of Layer 2 opportunities...  
Way I see it, if they burn down these last smoldering bridges to the core of the community... then the S2X fork is destined to lose out to all that innovation (and by extension all the NYA companies in DCG's portfolio who failed to stand with those on the side of science and progress). 
TL;DR: In the long run, it doesn't matter massively what NYA exchanges name the two chains, since atomic swaps, Layer 2 tech and decentralised exchanges is going to render them less and less relevant in the months and years ahead... unless they begin to pivot their ailing business models that revolve around commissions into providing more interesting value-adds for customers via Layer 2.  In which case they ought remain on good terms with the LN and Layer 2 devs building that tech, since nearly all of them support core.
NYA exchanges confusing tickers (and customers) has no major longterm negative impact on (f)actual BTC; it will simply mean a faster flight of clientele, capital and credibility as ordinary users begin to lose trust in NYA companies (and their ability to navigate and stay in good-faith harmony with a rapidly evolving bitcoin ecosystem and developer landscape).

I agree with your point wholeheartedly and not sure how I feel about doing this either...
But if we're facing multiple contentious forks like this moving forward it makes sense to protect the code from insidious actors. All you're really saying is "hey you're free to do what you want with the code on the proviso you don't threaten the integrity of the ecoystem and safety of the users funds we've already built this code to serve".  Less of a gun, more of a nice little gate anyone can open as long as they agree to not shit in the garden it leads to.

Don't disagree with you, but then the entire anti-science Xapo press release was equally idiotic and designed to deliberately confuse and provoke an already concerned community, when other (bigger ecosystem players than Xapo) had already laid out a responsible framework of procedures for dealing with the B2X fork.
We cannot blame customers whose only real recourse is to publicly vent their dismay like this.  
Don't forget **when the Apple App store blocked blockchain.info (an NYA signatory) they and others actively encouraged bitcoiners to boycott Apple and destroy their iPhones.**
[Protesters smash iPhones after Apple bans Bitcoin app - Financial Times](


I personally spent 48 hours without sleep cutting a [video]( together for them.
Others put [amazing things like this together]( that helped challenge the status quo and get Nic's baby back in the app store.
None of us did this for financial reward - but out of love for this community - and the *then* beautiful blockchain.info that [Nic too built out of love]( for an idea I thought he understood to be bigger and more important than both him and blockchain.info.
**Funny how quickly NYA signatories forget all their success is down to ordinary good people in this community** sticking up for them and doing things like the Apple boycott (with their blessing) that ensured blockchain.info returned to the App store.  And I'm not even going to go into the probably millions of lines of text in essays (and code) we've all written to win over hearts and minds that have helped those NYA companies succeed.
It's no wonder **people feel so very let down by them all.**

I think we may see big institutional investment money coming into B2X for awhile from the U.S. side, as their corporate governance structures and Paypal 2 esque vision may seem less risky and makes more sense to America at the moment... Although we could expect Silicon Valley to obviously side with BTC and the more open nature of it, especially amongst the startup communities there.  
I'd see tech savvy European and UK investors and fintech operations moving into the more open vision of BTC too alongside those Silicon Valley stalwarts.  I say that because I think Europe / UK are far less paranoid about the kinds of people using this tech (hence contactless cards and chip and pin rolled out there years ago, which Americans are slow to adopt).
Also a lot of B2X being moved over to BTC as you suggest.
Ultimately good for both sides if B2X have belief in their vision enough to think they can do this without needing to steal the BTC moniker (which they should be able to if they convince their heavyweight friends it works as a viable alt sitting below BTC).
Then a bunch of time for things to settle down as Layer 2 rolls out and we see what impact things like Zap have on the only thing that matters - the users of all this.
Built correctly and atomic swaps mean both B2X and BTC should be able to co-exist peacefully and support each other on the tech side.

The upside is the same as it was with BCH: 
A small contingent of people who don't understand computer science and have missed the longterm transformative potential of bitcoin, get to go play in their own sandpit after the fork and all the bad energy, endless debates, and poor decision making that comes from being in a constant state of fight of flight ends.  
Faith is restored in those on the side of science and bitcoin gets stronger as a result of having resisted yet another power grab... bitcoin moons, things go quiet for awhile until the next major wave of panic sets in a few years from now... and we are once again forced to come together to save the good spaceship bitcoin in the final hours.
**Roll into 2020...** 
A much more calm and stable bitcoin with all kinds of cool voting platforms that enable micro and macro streamlined governance where actors from all disciplines get to influence protocol progression without the need for endless debates and silly twitter 'wars'...  
Layer 2 is adopted by the biggest industry players and the internet (and world) begins to look completely different.  
Meanwhile alts like B2X, BCH and payment gatekeepers like Shapeshift are remembered as early bitcoin experiments that, in hindsight, were destined to go the same way as compuserve, AOL online and myspace.  Like the banks they sought to replace, some of these early bitcoin startups will pivot well into Layer 2, others will fail simply because they provide no real benefit to everyday users once Layer 2 further disrupts and decentralises incumbents in the space.  
Bottom-line: if your company is not solving REALLY big problems in the world through this technology in super exciting and imaginative ways, you probably need to go back to the drawing board.

Well being a Brit (but chiefly an Earthling), I am with the crazy "[Great Pirates]( (and Carl Sagan) who saw the entire planet - and species - as one.  Dunno' what I'd do without my cups of tea to get through the day (which came from those Great Pirates opening up trade routes with India of course).
As I say, I've been blessed to have travelled to around 60 countries, living with many different cultures from all walks of life (rich and poor).  My takeaway is that we are all the same when you strip away petty differences.  
Anyone who tells you we have to be triabalistic fails to see how the "Common Wealth" proved we actually are much better off when we all share resources, ideas and, yes, genes.  I am acutely aware that were it not for a random cosmic dicethrow than made me a white British person, I could easily have been an Indian or an American and I'd have had a completely different upbringing informing my subjective view of what reality is.  I am also aware that were it not for all cultures, religions and political stripes all pulling together in wars gone by, and the sacrifices our ancestors made, we wouldn't have many of the basic freedoms we have today.
And of course, the great borderless internet itself is proof that we can all get along regardless of race, colour, creed, age, wealth or upbringing.  Reddit and, indeed, bitcoin would not exist were it not for the plethora and wide-ranging diversity of ideas and cultural input that have helped shape their evolution.

Jeff is a coder.  He understands boolean algebra.  In that, there is much hope that if we steer clear of ad-hominem attacks and simply stick to technical arguments, then he will come around.  His logic is flawed.  If he ran his arguments through a compiler there would be multiple runtime errors :p
And if he doesn't see that, it really doesn't matter too much long term, any more than the BCH fork did, which is why I fought for their right to go do it (even though many bitcoiners were crapping themselves at the prospect).  Yes it's messy, but we can't wrap Roger, Jeff or Bitcoin up in bubble wrap, no matter how much we care for them.  
There is way too much amazing collaborative stuff going on inside Core, LN, Litecoin, Blockstream and the many many guys and gals I saw over at the Breaking Bitcoin conference who really, truly are just completely driven to building a better, more equitable world for all.  
That level of optimism for real, transformative change, is just way more contagious than business-as-usual discussions about ROI and all the other stuff the other side of this debate are concerned with.  It's not talk or ideas like that that built the internet, nor will it be talk like that fixes the disparity of wealth in the west and with it, rebuilds the lives of those in the third world and the 4 billion yet to participate in global trade.
Under those conditions, humanity has a way of figuring out the best way forward and surmounting the most improbable of odds...  That's how we got this far afterall!

Of course by virtue of the bitcoin global public ledger being infinitely *more* traceable than cash (and hidden offshore shell companies) intelligence and governments now have some really nifty tools for tracking the organised criminal class (who might have otherwise sought to use bitcoin in the same manner they used complex financial instruments and offshore havens to hide vast quantities of 'wealth').

You make very important points.  Note, I didn't call for the suppression of the art.  
I think my position is best summed up by Ernst Fischer when he observed "In a decaying society, art, if it is truthful, must also reflect decay. And unless it wants to break faith with its social function, art must show the world as changeable. And help to change it."
In my humble view, with so many positive things happening in this space (and the world) we have moved beyond the stage of needing to reflect the decay that lead us here now that we have the tools to transcend it.  
Neil Gaiman (author of 'American Gods', 'Stardust', and a number of Doctor Who episodes) puts this another way "Make good art, and the rest will follow."

I think the future is about collaboration, not competition, and I'm not anti-big companies as long as they have the "WHY?" right and follow sound, ethical business principles - they are, afterall, just a group of people with a common purpose.

- Are infrastructure services maturing and improving?
- Is there a technology roadmap in place for addressing current bottlenecks that are throttling growth and user uptake?
- Is the general public beginning to see advantages to using this technology to solve real world problems?
- Are tech giants looking at how to integrate bitcoin and crypto into their existing infrastructure and service offerings?
- Are we delivering better UX solutions and fixing problems that have so far blighted user adoption (Marketing Scams/Get Rick Quick ICOs/FUD ads)?
- Are we reaching out to new demographics and improving bitcoin education?
As a community, we can basically tick all of those boxes.  There's a lot of work to do, but the future (long term fundamentals) is looking brighter than ever.

You know, before I visited and lived in a communist country (Vietnam) years ago, I used to suffer the same Western brain damage conflating communism with some kind of dystopian evil empire where everyone would be oppressed and crazy.
It was watching a [BBC Top Gear Special]( of them touring Vietnam that made me think twice.  
I can honestly say, Vietnam was one of the safest, sweetest, happiest and most stunning countries I've ever visited.  Not without its problems (like all countries) but I was amazed to see kids running freely in cities without parents needing to worry about their safety, and families congregating together at night around open BBQ's on the street, playing music and laughing and welcoming happy western tourists at every opportunity without wanting to take advantage of them.  I didn't see a single fight in the 6 months I lived there in the middle of the thriving, busy city of Hanoi.
And to think, just 40 years ago Nixon came within inches of nuking them...  Could the same story of NK be told one day in the future when the current troubles are muddled through?  Have we all forgotten the Cuban missile crisis and seen how beautiful Cuba (and its people) have come to be since (with one of the finest free healthcare systems / green energy programs in the world)?
I was also amazed at how little Western consumerism had infiltrated Vietnamese lives (shopkeepers will turn you away if they think you won't fit into some of their clothes for instance, even though it means losing sales - unheard of in the West!).  And yet that mindset happily lives alongside Western commerce (sans the overbearing billboards pushing it down your throat) - Starbucks and modern shopping centres / consumer electronics stores could be found in different districts just a short ride from the centre.
The internet was basically fully uncensored there too (afaik) and cafes would share open Wi-Fi networks freely; in fact there's more sites blocked in the UK I think (for copyright reasons) than in places like Vietnam.
It didn't surprise me one bit then to hear bitcoin would be legalised there early next year. 
I've travelled to some 60 countries so far on this life journey and Vietnam is up there in my top 5 favourite places...  my take away is the same as Aldous Huxley's "To travel is to realise everyone is wrong about other people."
Given my experiences in Vietnam and other countries - when we take into account the terrible past (and current) Western/Eastern propaganda machines... I cannot possibly deem myself qualified to have an opinion on North Korea one way or another... I still remember vividly the IRA peace armistice,  the Berlin Wall coming down in 1989, and the iron curtain coming down soon after; and can see how far we've already progressed in such a short period of time...  
We only got there through travel, dialogue, and embracing and respecting each others different cultural views and ideas.
As such I prefer to follow Dennis Rodman's lead and go visit NK myself, meet real ordinary people living there, and see things with my own eyes before forming an opinion.  
Does that sound like a reasonable perspective to have on all this do you think?

Have you ever visited or lived in China?  
The internet, in Hong Kong for instance, is completely unrestricted.  In many respects it is *more* restricted in some western countries who are blocking websites that don't comply with big business copyright lobbyists and the like.  You also have [western companies and chains who had been utilising web blocking software all over the world]( that were, for a time, blocking environmental activist websites, LGBT resources, newspapers they didn't like and even results for *anything* related to bitcoin in cafes and public wi-fi spaces.  Remember too that employees of the U.S. administration and soldiers abroad were barred from accessing Assange and Snowden leaks, even though - because of the way laws on the free press work - it was perfectly legal for those people to go home and read information coming out of websites like [The Guardian](
Such is the 'invisible underhand' of control that has been exercised by big business around the world which is often whitewashed away by the media in favour of spinning up the old 'red scare' tribalistic fears that worked so well for Nixon and nearly lead to him nuking Vietnam before Watergate happened... The real damage being done, it seems, is by corporations of the 'greed is good' persuasion (which largely goes unnoticed) pitting the vast majority of wonderful, kind and peaceful Americans against one another for breadcrumbs being tossed to them by the people in 'control' of their information diet (and by extension their comprehension of the world they live in).
We might ask then that since a website is just information, how are any of those acts different to the clerics of old burning information in books they deemed heretical to the established order? (A practice which those very people in the West advocating blocking websites) would surely denounce?
None of this tribalism makes sense when we see some of our greatest achievements as a species, like the International Space Station and the internet itself (and yes, bitcoin) happen when all nations, religions and political stripes come together around a common cause in the spirit of unity.
*Back to China*
  
Artistic expression is completely open in Hong Kong (for example, I remember seeing an amazing Beatles cover band singing 'talking about a revolution' and 'all you need is love' last time I was there - and there are Karaoke bars and art galleries all over the place).  Same is true in the socialist, largely secular (Buddhist if anything) country of Vietnam where I lived for 6 months; websites teaching the Vietnamese about Bitcoin were *not* blocked in public spaces and the internet, as far as I could tell, was largely unrestricted.  Further, because they have such lax copyright laws, you can go visit huge supermarkets there full of Western movies and books with no restrictions on what can be sold.  
Which is perhaps why the Vietnamese government have announced they will be legalising bitcoin in 2018.
Indeed, a friend of mine from Hong Kong recently finished her thesis on the [Hong Kong Umbrella revolution]( which came as a result of Occupy.  She was a junior cop at the time who, in her spare time, joined with protestors exercising her right to freedom of speech.  Yes, that's right, Chinese cops were 'allowed' to openly join protestors when they were off duty.  I was pretty shocked to hear this too.  Could you imagine this being 'permitted' in America?
Note that police intimidation and violence were way more prominent in Occupy Wall Street protests in a supposedly 'free' democratic country (remember [Pepper Spraying cop?]( and the Wall St. crackdown that saw protestors beat by police with billy clubs?  How about [Naomi Klein's Freedom of Information request]( that lead to the revelation leaders in America suggested the 'Assassination of key Occupy Wall Street protestors' as a 'solution' to the threat of a populace exercising their 'right' to freedom of speech?  It appears they settled, in the end, for simply dumping dangerous criminals and drug addicts amongst protest camps instead, and then clamping down with oppressive police force.
Contrast that to the Hong Kong Occupy protests which were almost entirely peaceful events.

Your brain is precious, you can use it to sit around reading about events and other people or use it for thinking of how you might help bring about a new brighter world and how to expand your sphere of influence to positively enable yourself and others in that objective. 
If I spent time concerning myself with the likes of CW (who has no power here) then that's less time I have to think about helping the many amazing people I know in this space who share that above goal and aren't ruled by fear, greed or ego.  They need the most help and support since they are often the "quiet one's" you won't see or hear about.
Reminding people of those ego-driven demons who haunt the shadows does nothing but momentarily divert attention from those who choose to focus on the light.
I diverted a lot of brainpower in the past thinking and reading about the opinions of Paul Krugman et al before realising they had absolutely no influence at all over the trajectory of where the *actual* scientists who understood technology were taking all this.

My original statement laid out a number of recent events; from 'fake' diamonds impacting the diamond trade to the head of Goldman Sachs appearing on Bloomberg questioning why gold has any value really beyond the jewellery value we place on it.  Naturally that's gonna start a rather wide conversation with the vox populi.
I doubt too that younger generations embracing crypto have much interest in gold.
Regardless, I made no bold predictions about any of this, I merely stated "the next wave of all this is going to start looking very interesting."
Which it certainly is.

The reputation blockchain has already been built.  It's called Web of Trust, Youtube upvotes, Uber ratings, Google ratings, Linked in reputation, Reddit Karma and, in the case of AirBnB, the ratings hosts and visitors have been receiving for the last 7+ years.  
All that's missing now is a Blockstack ID to unify all this (coming soon) and a more transparent approach with better user-centric web funding models in place for the billions of users of those platforms (much like Patreon.com supporters are happy to pay to support the work of others).
A lot of us on here have already built web services that have scaled to millions of users, and are relishing what is around the corner for a Web 3.0 world that no longer has to be funded by advertisers or is subjected to gargantuan payment gateway fees in order to keep those services afloat.
In that respect, the ideas in this whitepaper are nothing we haven't all been thinking about for the last 7 or more years.  
But, just as with the entire Web 2.0 movement, rebuilding things takes time and patience, especially when you have a duty of care to onboarding the millions / billions of users who already use your services.

So what we really need then is a decentralised mining pool client, with a neat little UX, where miners themselves can choose at the flick of a switch on the GUI where they want to move hashpower to without needing to reconfigure anything.  We can envisage something like LukeDashJr's coinbase surveys forming part of the GUI, allowing miners to collectively assess the various pros/cons of supporting a different initiative.
With no commissions going to pool operator middlemen this would also be a more profitable option for miners and should see them unplugging from pools en masse.  
This would also basically nullify the 51% attack vector too since they'd basically all be independent miners again, but still sharing a stake as if the client GUI itself were a pool.  
Might be cool to see the original pool (slushpool) developing this, in recognition that it's the best thing we could do to ensure longterm stability of bitcoin - the protocol.  Could envisage Core or Amir Taaki's new Hacker Academy working on something like this with slushes existing code being ported over to desktop client side code... with a pretty quick launch window if they put their mind to it.
Have I missed anything there?

Yes exactly.  In fact, BlahBlah car already established this and it works brilliantly (used it myself a number of times all over Europe).  Same with Couchsurfing vs. AirBnB.
In terms of land re-use, the JustPark app represents Car Parking without Gatekeepers (anyone with a space can list it and set their own price).
This opens up an interesting new way of managing resources whereby anyone not making efficient use of their land and resources - and getting paid for it! (be that car parking, spare houses, boats, lawnmowers etc.) without good reason would see a net social capital and monetary deficit... Such a system would incentivise them to share those unused resources with the wider community. 
Car use itself: we're not far away now from smart locks backed by a smart contract that allows any good actor to simply use a car or bike when the owner makes it available.  The majority of cars sit there unused for most of their lives (think of the dead time they spend 9-5 in the workplace car park for instance).
In years to come I'm quite sure we will all be asking "Can you believe EVERYONE on the street used to own their own lawnmower which they only used an hour every 2 months?  Madness!"
Imagine if each device (like a lawnmower, car) had an integrated smart chip in the plug / ignition that measured use so that individuals and communities could figure out where resource usage waste was happening and re-route those resources to where they were needed... This works for people energy too (Opens App: I need a lawnmower AND someone to mow my lawn - bam, old guy down the road who spends most of the day inside, meets his neighbour for the first time, mows their lawn, makes money and strengthens community bonds through getting to know their neighbour).

We call this the wisdom of well informed crowds.  A bunch of men meeting behind closed doors to sign an 'agreement' outside the purview of the community AND the computer scientists that built it, results in a whole bunch of bad decisions being made.

Law will be one of the first things to be decentralised.  See a world of tomorrow where civil and criminal cases, nation state and corporate governance, all happen via the wisdom of well informed crowds and group consensus...  
Raad Ahmed's [Lawtrades]( initiative (backed by Bitcoin maximalist Tim Draper) is an early insight into what this will look like.
This will intersect and disrupt everything from the financing of new ideas via Kickstarter type services that require no intermediaries, real estate and property ownership to how we decide to govern local townships and, later, cities (see [Bitnation Pangea]( for a glimpse of what these 'networked-states' begin to look like).
In the adjacent possible future we now straddle, the idea that we outsourced much of our 'law' to fallible humans that were corrupted by money, power and a two-tier justice system, will seem as insane as the 'witch trials' of old.  
And the idea we had multiple operating systems, browsers, bitcoin wallets, and all the other junk that has many bright people stepping over each others toes in the name of 'competition' will seem just as retarded.  Which is why, of course, the International Space Station and forward thinking governments switched from Windows to Linux many years ago.  
Allow code contributors to self-fund and get rewarded for good work via the crowd (and the real world economic energy that comes from that) and those open systems and project builds attract more and more quality energy where the greatest ideas and quality of work gain critical mass without the need to appeal to any authority or patriarch to put breadcrumbs on the table.

I love that 'delusional' statement.  "You're delusional!  Get in the real world" people will say to me and I'll say, as someone who has actually travelled to and lived in some 60 countries in the *actual* real world (instead of being tethered to a desk in some city office district for 10 years with a boss who has erected invisible prison walls)....I will say "hmmm, what is this 'real' world you speak of?  Everything we see around us that we call reality is made of language, it was just an idea in someones head... Did you consent to this inter-subjective reality you think is so 'real'?  Or do you think we can do better?"  Of course people called Steve Jobs and others 'delusional' too.  And yet they consented to his visions of a new reality.  Just as incumbents are now 'consenting' to the 'reality' those far seeing visionaries that built Bitcoin created.
In the end, 'reality' and the future it bends into will be a battleground of ideas, as it always is.  And it will be those ideas that tend toward freedom and unity that win out in the end, as they always do. 
And laggards and 'ordinary' people (perhaps like you), chained to a desk and a boss, and 9-5 consumerism will fight the ideas that will eventually set them free, just as the luddites smashed the farming equipment and the printing presses that set them free.  Just as the techies professed with absolute certainty "Nothing will replace CD's!" with the same level of hubris as you seem to have in proclaiming nothing will stop advertising.  Failing to see there are entire countries and cities on this planet that don't have advertising where everything works just fine...  Failing to see that the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) doesn't have advertising (for good reason) and everything works just fine...  Failing to see that BRAVE browser, strips the internet of advertising and allows users to compensate web owners directly on a pay what you can afford model backed by bitcoin... And everything works **better** than just fine.
So... like those that ended up using Email and MP3's and Smartphones and all the other things I was an early adopter in and was ridiculed for using... when the masses end up adopting, it will all become self-evident and they will forget they once opposed the changes.  
Just as they forgot they opposed civil rights, gay marriage, and all the other sweeping changes and ideas that ripple through the crowd...  You too will forget you once failed to see a reality where advertising would no longer be fit for purpose.
I am quite certain, the concepts we have that build towards a resource-based economy and evolve this species to a type I civilisation capable of reaching the stars and beyond, will be those ideas that thrive.  
Ideas that we've been working on for decades that are now within our grasp.  
I do not know exactly what twists and turns will lead us there, only that we will get there sooner than we realised.  Which reminds me of Mark Zuckerberg's favourite quote "We overestimate what we can achieve in a year, but underestimate where we will be in 10."

Remember bitcoin is a tool like any other.  Its strength is in the people using it to move us to a world beyond greed, poverty, war.  If you live in an ivory tower shielded from all that, you're unlikely to see how all those things are connected to you and your failure to step up and take action.  
To strive for something greater means going out of your comfort zone, climbing down from the tower and diving into the unknown.  
It is indeed a lonely journey, for it is one we must take alone.  Most are happy with their material comforts and the neon glare of a manufactured reality.  
But the journey beats being owned by those things you think you own ;)

Can't underscore the importance of Muffin's advice here.  The less noise for new users the better.  
One of the biggest problems BTC has that's been holding back non tech savvy user adoption is the amount of 'competing' wallet and exchange implementations out there which has meant all kinds of substandard coding leading to data breaches and general confusion amongst new adopters.
We ought to be looking at collaborating on one standard set of client solutions with impeccable UX and a huge army of collaborators doing peer review behind the scenes (similar to how bitcoin core itself is managed and other collaborative open source projects like Android, Linux, Chromium).
The litmus test ought to be: If your Mom and Pop can use it as easily as they can their internet banking app (and feel safe knowing their funds are secure there), then the next key demographic in the bitcoin adoption wave will come.

If there is a lesson to be learned in this post-truth era of Brexit and Trump we're all going through it's that labelling your opponents 'racists' or 'alt-right conspiracy theorists' does nothing but further divide the group and inflame the very people we are trying to reach with the truth, ostracizing those who sit on the fence who are put off by the tactics of both groups.

So you know the old adage "two heads are better than one?"  And, the concept of "wisdom of the crowd"...
Do we think that, *coding up solutions to hard problems* is gonna' be better when we have 200+ super nerds figuring out those solutions to hard problems...  or do we think one gatekeeper with a vested interest in ensuring bitcoin is anchored to his payment gateway is going to create better solutions?
And what do we think all those investors and ordinary people who have been relying on those 200+ people (many of whom we here before that one coder and his company arrived on the scene) will feel safer with?
**If you're capable of just coldly analyzing this without the politics let's imagine this scenario in November:**
1. You have one million dollars in bitcoin.  It has been safe since 2009.  Development and changes can't happen (on BTC) without many amazing scientists working on bitcoin together and agreeing on those changes (BIPs / Consensus rules continue as per the last 8 years).
2. The S2X happens without replay protection; hashpower has gone to S2X but Core is still going.  It's taking 4 hours for blocks to confirm but your one million dollars are still safe.  Do you move your money or leave it there and wait patiently (how fast do the majority of true bitcoin holders really need to have blocks confirm anyway if they're patiently waiting for this nascent tech to evolve?).  On top of that, without replay protection, many holders are cautious about moving their coins anyway...  
3. What happens to the price of S2X in the meantime with only one coder there and a bunch of vested interests...  What happens to development (the 200 coders are still with Core and working on Lightning / Rootstock / Blockstack).  What happens when Home Vega mining kits and so forth become available and the *actual* bitcoin keeps going up in price?
4. What happens if all those new developments and core updates come with a new and more restrictive licence that says contentious hard fork coins cannot use any code that comes from Layer 2 tech / core updates?
5. Bitcoin core price keeps rising.  S2X plummets.  Mining S2X is no longer profitable.  Hashpower returns to core after a few months, ZAP and other epic layer 2 tech apps and services being roll-out.  S2X is just another alt with difficulty fluctuating just like BCH is today.

Depends if you believe in that propensity all humans have to commit both good and evil and whether you are willing to forgive (!= forgetting) past mistakes; many of which are borne of fear and ignorance, not some innate streak of evil that renders us incapable of changing.
Do we hate Germans because most were duped into sleepwalking into facism?  What about Trump followers that have fallen for the same scapegoat mentality?  Do we, as westerners, have blood on our own hands for not doing more to look at how our own footprints and addiction to consumerist lifestyles perpetuated the oil companies war in Iraq?  Are we lining the war criminals pockets then by extension then when we thoughtlessly get a plastic cup and straw (which came from oil) from Starbucks instead of asking for a porcelain one?  Are we perpetuating the war and wage slavery we shout at corporations about by not recycling our old mobile phones and laptops or opting out of the system altogether?  Everytime we get drunk, high, sit in front of the TV or games console instead of doing something productive that is helping the lives of those affected by all this... Are we shirking our own individual responsibility and ability to change this through our own actions within the system?  
After all, the only reason we still have an Ozone layer is because enough individuals in the 80s gathered enmasse and stopped purchasing CFC aersols and fridges.  We have plenty of options as free consumers to only partake in ethical purchases if we want to stop the war criminals.  But many would rather pass that responsibility (and blame) to politicians and the 'system' itself.
It all goes back to the [Milgram Experiment]( in the end, no matter where you stand on the food chain.
To understand this, look to your own life and things you have done and said you are not proud of based on poor information and a fuzzy understanding of things going on around you...  We are all a product of our environment and teaching...  the result of a random cosmic dice-throw, that lead to you being you... That George Bush you hate?  That's YOU given another throw of the dice.  
If you can't recognise this and learn to forgive, then you and your opponent are always going to be fighting... which makes you no better than those fueled by hate, greed and ignorance that you seek to oppose, since you use the same tactics as them to divide instead of embracing those things we have in common.
Do we not all look to the same stars and wonder what all this is about?  The universe makes no distinction between those who do so from the gutter or the invisible glass prison walls of the penthouse.  With that realisation comes a profound peace that tells us these dark days will be over just as soon as we collectively come to terms with the terrifying truth: we already live in a world of abundance and we no longer have to fight.  Change of that magnitude of course means going out of our comfort zones.  And if there's one thing humans fear more than destruction, it's change.  
After all, we have developed coping strategies to deal with destruction we are well used to calling upon.  Change, however, means embracing the unknown.

Yes.  Provide sources please.
FYI: China permitted exchanges to operate for years without a licence, aka *without control* (unlike the U.S. which required coinbase to spend $1m in every state it wished to operate in).  The recent Chinese crackdown came as a result of ICO's and scams that were seeing ordinary Chinese citizens being duped out of their money.  Simon Dixon (see below) mentioned he was seeing 5 blatantly fraudulent ICO's a week launching there, some even using his name endorsing them.  He's British not Chinese, and has been in bitcoin since the beginning...  His insights are therefore *highly objective* and as such a fairly well balanced unbiased inside primary source of information.
The Chinese investigation into exchanges is to ensure that none are operating fractional reserve outfits and there are proper security measures in place to ensure customer funds are safe, so they can avoid another Mt. Gox (which are in effect the same measures taken *pre-emptively* by U.S. government officials in cracking down on exchanges *before* they even had a chance to open up).  
Had they not done this, then it would be only a matter of time before the same sheisters running ICO scams moved into the exchange market.  Last thing bitcoin needs is more scams and hacks on the exchange level, so guess what...  China are actually protecting the longterm vision and stability of bitcoin by stepping in.
Of course none of that sits well with the "communism is bad M'Kay" narrow minded narrative many people have as a result of media bias, any more than largely socialist European countries like Sweden (that have the best education, employment and healthcare systems on the planet) sits well with the McCarthy era "all gubberments are bad except ours" rhetoric, that lead to people like [Charlie Chaplin]( (branded a socialist but was no such thing) leaving America to return to the UK in 1952 and essentially declare Americans had gone bonkers ;)
**"Whether I re-entered that unhappy country or not was of little consequence to me. I would like to have told them that the sooner I was rid of that hate-beleaguered atmosphere the better, that I was fed up of America's insults and moral pomposity..."** — Charlie Chaplin, speaking privately in 1952 ([Source:Wikipedia](
For those keen to learn from the mistakes made in the past, there is a clear correlation with everything happening in bitcoin world right now, and the things our ancestors went through... It just takes a bit of time to step back and begin to join the dots.

Quite possibly, it really depends if they exercise the humility and common sense to see they can't brute force BTC away from an open source community that has been believing in this for 7 years or more and is committed to decentralisation and non-hierarchical leadership.

Bitcoin tech is about where we were when the internet comprised mainly of BBS and email newsgroups.
Layer 2 (which is just around the corner) is effectively Bitcoin's Netscape Navigator moment.
When Rootstock is ready, alongside Atomic Swaps, then ethereum and solidity will work seamlessly in tandem with the bitcoin blockchain (effectively utilised as the base underlying settlement layer).
The only thing people will be asking when they sell their house / company / stock over blockchain tech in the future will be "Which is the most secure blockchain protocol in the world to do this on?"  You only need to think what blockchain solution YOU would trust if you were to make such a sale, to see how 99% of the crowd would go... 
In that near-future, ethereum and everything else we see happening in the current blockchain 'dotcom rush' will start looking like intranet vs. internet.  Why email within the walled-garden of microsoft intranet that is subject to all kinds of internal exploits, maintained by 9-5 coders on a salary and has crippled functionality when the internet is constantly being tested for bugs, runs on secure protocol-level code and has a plethora of new innovations being released on a daily basis?
It is this longerm thinking that leads Core to being so insistent that **THE ONLY THING that matters longterm is bitcoin remains the most secure blockchain on the planet.**
Will we be able to say that about the Swiss-Backed foundation of Ethereum with hierarchical governance and a benign dictator in charge?
Or what about the one-man coding army behind B2X given they seem to think changing a blocksize variable is more important than those longterm security concerns?
Time will tell.

Forget Google trends, it's Reddit subscriber count that really matters.  Conflate what's happening with bitcoin with all the other technological advances we're seeing, and prepare for a few massive announcements from the likes of Google when Layer 2 tech is ready and we're looking at less than a few years I think until mass adoption starts taking off and BTC is as normal and widespread as debit cards.

Well bitcoin is not anonymous, it's pseudonymous.  Right now in a world where a large percentage of physical cash is being used in the shadow economy a public global ledger actually makes things easier for traditional forensic analysis.  
This gets even easier when good actors (99.9% of the populace) elect to transact in a more open world with one another and company / personal / government accounting is largely automated (no need for collecting till receipts, and no worrying about governors taking bribes or kick-backs and businesses cheating the network). 
This is called "Glass Governance" where every payment in and out of companies / government / local councils is transparent.  We never face a scenario then where a company can profit from say, Land Mines and the Blood Diamond trade (Diamonds are already being tracked on the blockchain for instance).  Same with Land Registry, never can an invading army come in and destroy the land registry records and seize property illegally as we've seen in the past, since a global, immutable ledger is keeping track of everything.  
Moreover, your personal data is encrypted - you only share your details (everything from identity and medical records to finance data) with entities you trust, so we're not relying on for-profit third parties anymore that lead to the kinds of data breaches we've seen at Walmart, Equifax, Panama etc.
We're a few years away from all that becoming reality as it requires a few upgrades to bitcoin (blockstack, rootstock, lightning network) to begin really disrupting things in a responsible, carefully planned out manner.  
But we are already seeing the UN World Food Program and Bitnation experimenting with some of these concepts, as well as some isolated UBI blockchain pilots and Ecuador running a trial for the Land Registry on the blockchain IIRC.

I did yes, I don't like being talked down to, especially by self proclaimed 'experts' who have no clue who I am or just how long I've been involved in computer science and the internet.  
I'm interested in open discussion with kind, thoughtful people capable of realising none of us have all the right answers and this entire thing is a process.  I'm interested less so in debate and argument with those who simply get kicks out of being 'right'.  Which is why I enjoy taking part in panel discussions on all this where the emphasis is on discussion, not debate. 
To be frank, there's just too much good work, good energy from people united behind this technology across all social strata, professions and geography to worry about those stuck in Plato's cave.  I didn't worry about them when I was helping build the internet and I won't worry about them interfering with the work we're doing with the internet of money. 
The world and technology will move forward with or without the lagards and naysayers who failed to see why Bitcoin was invented.

I'd say that's the value.  The wealth is derived from the output of that energy-as-value.  i.e. do we build rockets of destruction or rockets of discovery? 
One of those rockets has more inherent wealth for humankind and the survival of the species, than the other.  When coupled with the wisdom of well informed crowds, it's obvious which one would be built by a global collective of citizens.  
Which is where trust-market (as opposed to free market) mechanics starts to weed out any bad actors and companies that don't have a reason (beyond profit incentive) for existing.

The first bitcoiners to meet in London were incredibly diverse (I was there at the very beginning of all this)...  There was a South African, an Indian philanthropist, an Iraqi, a coder from the Maldives working for the banks, an old English ex-government aristocrat, an old hippie from the same town as Banksy (Bristol)... the list goes on...  
They all had different ideologies, different ideas for how the world could work and how bitcoin could help bring us all together.  Those initial meets were like London itself really - the most multi-culturally diverse city on the planet.

How is the argument flawed?  We have a thing called *mens rea* and it is as applicable to Aaron as it is to a homosexual in the 60's.
But ultimately this is about Aaron being subjected to 'cruel and unusual punishment' (a violation of the 8th amendment) in the form of 35 years in jail if he wished to have the case (and law) tested.  He had designs on going into politics, if he had accepted a plea bargain this would have meant having a criminal record and not being able to pursue those goals as well as many others.  
He had every right to have the case heard, but 35 years being on the cards for the 'privilege' can in no way justify the crime, especially when the main complainant (JSTOR) had dropped all charges.  Hence we have a motion called 'Aaron's Law' being discussed in the senate right now.

Again, beautifully, thoughtfully written, now let me pick it apart in as nice away as possible.  


To travel well is to leave your prejudices and preconceptions back in the land you came from and throw yourself head first into the customs and culture of the places you visit.  Not to fear their religion, food or belief systems but to revel, in it all.  


I'm just a good working class boy who has lived all over England, then worked very hard building his own computer and internet businesses so that he could become one of the earliest known digital nomads able to travel with nothing but a laptop and still stay in touch with his own culture back home via the internet.  But above all, I'm a good listener, and watcher of people who sees everyone as equal. ;)
There is nothing more beautiful than to sit on the hills overlooking Sarajevo watching the sunset to the Muslim call to prayer followed by Christian church bells ringing out... after spending days listening to tales from war vets who saved the city during the Bosnian War... and hearing how the war and horrors they went through brought them all closer together.


It's no longer subjective.  All the latest neuroscience tells us there is *no real difference*.  Gender is learnt, just as racism is something we are taught.  


This is correct.  And it is why those countries that embrace cultural diversity and mixing of the gene pools eventually end up with much more genetic diversity and, with it, a much greater array of experiences, ideas and different outlooks on the world than more closed groups.  Which, in turn, leads to safer and happier citizens.  One only has to spend a number of years living in Australia and New Zealand to see how the two different approaches to colonisation has lead to completely different cultures, one that is mixed and diverse (NZ) vs. one that is far less culturally advanced (OZ).  
See how the UK (the most genetically diverse people in Europe) embraced multi-culturalism (their favourite two cuisines are 1. Indian Curries and 2. Chinese Food).  Perhaps not a surprise given they were the original great pirates (as Bucky Fuller calls them in Operating Manual for a Spaceship Earth) that sailed the great uncharted waters of the oceans and with it, began connecting all the information and trade routes.  


I have sooooo many friends that did just that (moved to the UK at around the age of 5 or 7), from Iran and Africa, Afghanistan, Iraq, America...  you name it.  They all consider themselves British, and adapted perfectly to a new way of life.  Conversely, I have British friends who emigrated to France, their kids of a similar age now consider themselves French.  Then I have friends whose parents were in the Royal AirForce who travelled all around the globe as kids... They are my most interesting friends due to the rich experiences they had as children ;)


Well, we could talk about the Napoleonic wars and how Rothschild used them to [short the UK stock market]( and basically bankrupt the country in the 1800's, or the fact that the UK only finished paying back their WWII debt to America in 2006 for saving the world from facism.  We could talk about the renaissance and how really it's only information and art - not money - that truly civilises the world.  We could talk about the anti-Vietnam war protests, watergate, Charlie Chaplin's Great Dictator speech in 1938 (opposing Hitler before the American government did only to return to the UK in 1953 for being accused of being a socialist - he was no such thing of course)... We could talk about British cultural exports like the Beatles, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones that lead to those anti war protestors saving Vietnam from being nuked by Nixon...  
We could talk about how the Constitution has never changed in America, how Christianity still holds men and women shackled and living in fear, how those rich uncles you speak of are only rich because of the land they inherited through blood their ancestors spilt... We could talk about how there's no evidence we even had [monogamy]( before the invention of the plough 10,000 years ago, that it was simply invented by the ruling class to keep land and farm ownership in the family. 


Well if you want to believe in anything, just believe in your own ability to help shape that future.


First define what you want to see happen in the world.  For me, it is for science and objective reality to lead the way in all affairs; it is for us to stop putting a price tag on property of the mind, and realise that within our lifetimes we could quite easily usher forth a golden age of autonomy that leads to a resource based economy, an end to war, poverty and greed.  Heck, given the changes we've seen in the last 10 years, it would not even surprise me to hear Google Calico have cracked age reversal and we've cured every disease on the planet.
Ah, but what will we do?  Well we look to the stars and the inner-worlds we get to create via VR, and just enjoy the beauty of knowing we get to spend time building and creating things as true global nomads living in harmony with one another...  Life is no longer a race, it's just a beautiful never-ending story of discovery...


No you're dead wrong.  Anger leads to more darkness, more hatred, more fear.  You wanna' break the cycle of violence, then you need to be part of the change that leads to that.

It depends where it came from.  If I was giving a lecture and a normally attentive, thoughtful student suddenly reacted in this way due to their passion and knowledge in a subject I understood little about, I would forego the urge to punish and instead enter into a dialogue as to why they so fervently disagreed with the statement I was making.  
Learning can be a 2 way street, and the better teachers at my school were the ones that encouraged this kind of debate, recognising that there's a big difference between passion and insolence.

I have not, but I've read plenty first hand source accounts from those who have.  Until I see it myself with my own eyes, I will reserve judgement.
Just as I did with China, India, Vietnam, Eastern Europe during the iron curtain...  and the 60 or so other countries I've seen which people warned me against (and were dead wrong).
I'd highly recommend looking into places like Iran from the viewpoint of *real* people who have visited there.  
Lonely Planet forums are a wonderful resource (full of first hand source accounts) in that regard.  
Or sit with some army veterans from the RAF or Navy who have actually seen the places for *real* insight outside the echo chamber of press regurgitating xenophobic soundbites from emperors with no clothes.

Mostly, it's cringe worthy and tacky low-brow wit, which is not something I am used to from my 4 years+ in this subreddit (comprising as it did mostly of technologists, entrepreneurs and computer nerds excited about bitcoin - the technology).  
The 1000-3000+ new subscribers arriving here each day are obviously going to bring with it a shift in those demographics, and younger kids from 4Chan who find this kind of anything goes 'Beavis N Butthead' type stuff humorous, will fail to see that by excluding those outside of their 'bro culture' cliques, they actually do harm to the very cause (bitcoin) they are here to champion.
At the end of the day, it's easier to recycle a meme for cheap laughs than it is to come up with original ideas and content that make people truly think (and laugh) at the same time. 
But none of this does any real long term harm, since the technology will evolve regardless of what you, I, or white privileged boys say on this subreddit.

Absolutely I do yes, it was drilled into me during WWII history lessons as a youngster how both sides (allies and nazis) lied to the populace during war times and how understanding bias, and primary, secondary, tertiary sources is key to making sense of the world.
Indeed, during the Iraq War, you would often see my reading 5 separate newspapers during lunch breaks just to get the most basic information on what actually happened in the day.  Same on cable: I would check BBC, Al Jazheer, RT, MSNBC and still only have a basic grasp on reality and whether events happened as they appeared.
As a bitcoiner, you should know better than most how much poorly sourced nonsense journalists write.  So what makes you think they have a better handle on the rest of the news?
Michael Crichton (author of Jurassic Park) calls it the  Gell-Mann Amnesia effect.
“Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's full of them.
In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.”

Great points.  I'd just add:
Jamie's statement suggesting Bitcoin wasn't legalised in Japan, is false.
See: [Japan is set to begin recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting tomorrow](  [Vietnam]( and myriad other governments have also made moves to recognise BTC as a formal payment method.
As for Jamies other comments:
The wonderful Nick Colas from Convergex Group tackled pretty much every point Jamie raised wayyy back in 2013 on Bloomberg.
[Video Link - On Bitcoin's Legitimacy](
*"If you are a U.S. buyer of bitcoin your institution is regulated by U.S. law, so there is not total anonymity...80% of US Dollar bills go outside the U.S. and how many times do you see news of a drug bust where there are stacks and stacks of hundred dollar bills?  The fact that a currency is used for illicit activity doesn't make it immoral or illegitimate... " — Nick Colas*
As for Jamie's (borderline xenophobic) knee-jerk comments on bitcoin being used in places like Venezuela, here's an explanation from Chamath Palihapitiya in 2013 who talks about bitcoin being used in this context as a proactive way to *solve* problems ordinary people are facing in those countries.
[Video Link - Bitcoin [is] a Huge, Huge, Huge Deal!](
*"I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fun, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. Because what you're talking about right now is, for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right? The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government. It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina. Everywhere you have currency pressure. Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. And then, after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism." 
— Chamath Palihapitiya*
The payment mechanism part Chamath alluded to is just about to happen thanks to Layer 2 technology augmenting the base bitcoin blockchain protocol (as [explained here]( by Andreas).

To say my teacher was full of shit wasn't saying I was any more correct than him, just that he had no right to claim absolute authority over the future of a subject he knew very little about (especially given the impact computers had already had by the late 80's: ATM's, NASA, Stock Exchange, Calculators on every desk)...
Those who claim bitcoin is going to takeover Government money are no better than Schiff or my English teacher, and my comment is aimed just as much at bitcoiners who believe they know how the future is going to pan out, as it is to the naysayers who say bitcoin is dead.

Absolutely I do yes, it was drilled into me during WWII history lessons as a youngster how both sides (allies and nazis) lied to the populace during war times and how understanding bias, and primary, secondary, tertiary sources is key to making sense of the world.
Indeed, during the Iraq War, you would often see my reading 5 separate newspapers during lunch breaks just to get the most basic information on what actually happened in the day.  Same on cable: I would check BBC, Al Jazheer, RT, MSNBC and still only have a basic grasp on reality and whether events happened as they appeared.
As a bitcoiner, you should know better than most how much poorly sourced nonsense journalists write.  So what makes you think they have a better handle on the rest of the news?
Michael Crichton (author of Jurassic Park) calls it the  Gell-Mann Amnesia effect.
“Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's full of them.
In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.”

See there you go casting aspersions and thinking you are superior to someone you have never met.
What did bitcoin solve?  Well, first off the double spend problem.  Secondly, the small issue that we have been measuring economic energy via a measurement tool we call money, when no-one has a clue how much of this money actually exists.
The whole thing is an inter-subjective delusion.  
Does that mean bitcoin will fix all the world's problems?  Nope, but then bitcoin is not evolving in a technological vacuum any more than home computers then the internet did.

I would just say, perhaps lose that opening line.  We do not need to send people into a defensive state of fight or flight from the get go.  Remember those drafting this aren't necessarily 'evil', just massively out of their depth in a world they don't yet understand.  Most are drafting and supporting this kind of medieval legislation out of good intentions because 'control' is the only thing they have known...  Most of our parents / grandparents are just as ignorant of this tech; that doesn't make them bad people.
"We live in a world exquisitely dependent on science and technology where hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology." — Carl Sagan
Nothing could be more true than the science and technology behind bitcoin.  Heck most bitcoin supporters don't *really* understand the tech behind it, and most bitcoin companies have practically no conceptualisation of what Layer 2 is about to unleash.
For those stuck in [Plato's Cave]( it's incumbent upon us to shine a light in there, just as Andreas Antonopoulos did by going into the [Canadian]( and [Australian]( senates many years ago to help them understand the technology.  We want them to get excited by it, and see this amazing science as a way out of that cave.  Not push them further into the shadows.
This is not a fight, bitcoin (which *is* just science and mathematics) is there to save 'them' as much as it is 'us'.  And it needs everyone onboard.  We must seek to educate those that are ignorant and fearful (on and of both 'sides') if we want to find a way out of the darkness.

Prediction was based on the retail cost of a CD at HMV and all the money lost to intermediaries in the chain. Madonna was the highest paid artist back then, she made about 22p per CD sale.  CDrs cost ten quid for 10 at retail.  Put all those numbers together and you begin to get an idea of what digitising everything would do to the market in ten years time when broadband would be ubiquitous and cost to distribute / copy virtually free when you remove physical distribution constraints.  
The prediction was also based on the amount of disposable income average people had for entertainment (most working class people would buy 1-2 CDs per month), so that tells us if we want people to continue spending that amount we'd need to offer more than simply the equivalent of 1 digital CD a month.
If you think that's an impressive prediction though, you should see Ray Kurzweil and Bill Gates' track records ;)

Indeed it is.  Otherwise known as the early innovators that we have seen push tech forward many times before through that [diffusion of innovations] ( arc.
You sound exactly like those people who would laugh at me for using a first generation iPod "CDs will never be replaced!".
And, before that, my old English teacher who would tell me to get my head out of computer books because they are a passing fad.
I eventually became a computer scientist of course and fell in love very early on with the technology of Bitcoin...  in the exact same way I fell in love with the early mobile phones, internet, emails, mp3 and the new invention oh home computers back in those English classes... I don't have to convince any of those that will remain firmly in the laggards camp on that diffusion graph until this becomes self evident to them.

At the moment (at least in the UK) bitcoin is only subject to capital gains tax.  
In the future I'd envisage a Voluntary taxation system that allows you to decide (on macro and micro scale) where you would like your economic energy to be spent.  Much like Islam works (everybody donates around 10% of their earnings to causes they're interested in, that's it).
Paying tax and helping fund amazing initiatives would then be seen as a point of pride as you see your energy being put to actual good work (building schools, maintaining local hospitals, foreign aid infrastructure investment and so forth).
"Glass Governance" then becomes far less about tax collection and redistribution as most of that work is handed over to the crowd, in much the same way we see crowdfund projects do amazing things for communities.  So rather than the state needing tax collection, the emphasis is on worthwhile transparent distribution.  And since everybody is paying the same amount, no-one needs to feel cheated by those using loopholes etc.  The enforcement to comply side is basically replaced with incentive to do good.
Couple this with liquid democracy voting platforms that allow people to vote on macro and micro issues they have expertise in and the role of central government is diminished as many tasks are moved over to towns, local councils and their populace (that know their needs best).
Bitnation are doing amazing things in this area.  Especially Johan Nygren's work with "Resilience" and dividend pathways.

You are absolutely right.
And that human layer starts with those 200 or so computer scientists invested in bitcoin - the technology.  Businesses competing for breadcrumb commissions (centralised exchanges, multiple wallet implementations, middleware payment gateways like shapeshift and bitpay) are largely a distraction that will be deprecated by Layer 2 tech.
We're witnessing the Microsoft 'browser wars' on steroids here and most invested in the technology side that were here when all this happened during the internet dotcom boom/bust, have seen all this happen before (just not at this speed due to the faster spread of information that internet the infrastructure they helped create has enabled).

Segwit activation and successfully getting through the BCH hardfork.  It took a gargantuan effort from the entire ecosystem (core, exchanges, FUDbattlers on twitter / reddit, UASFers) to get there.  
The rally was the effect of a massive collective sigh of relief.  Everything in this space is about psychology ("If you want to know what markets will do, don't ask an economist, ask a psychologist :p" — Lord Goldsmith).
The China news is unexpected and the next potential fork (Segwit 2x) looms ever closer so people are taking profits off the back of knee-jerk panic sells instigated by the silly Dimon comments (he made the same comments almost verbatim in 2014 and no-one paid the slightest bit of attention).  
All the new users here are probably unaware of that history, hence the needless airtime Dimon was given.  
Having just returned from the Paris Lightning meet, I can say the mid / long term tech fundamentals are looking stronger than ever, so we just need a little patience as the old and new world adjust to the changes.  China news is probably good long term: things do need to be tightened on the ICO / Exchange front (since there's so much room for scammers right now) if we want Mama and Papa using all this safely.
If you can forget about the prices and just go enjoy the rest of the summer until after November, then that's probably a good idea...

You're not getting it are you?  At the same time my english teacher was telling me computers were a passing fad, I had been one of the first early adopters of a computer that very few people had heard of and saw where things were going (in part thanks to my stepdad who was a programmer)... and then, this little black box eventually went insane years later (thanks to the then nascent computer games industry) and, like you say, landed in 1 in 6 households.
Were it not for those early adopters that could see the utility of the computer, ignoring the derision of their friends and naysayers like my teacher, it would not have taken off.
It took time for people to find novel uses for the computer and to learn the basics of how to operate them via clunky command line interfaces and tape decks which evolved over time... To the point where we now have 70 year old grannies using skype on their ipads at the airport.
It's all good, new ideas take time to propagate and find their footing and half a decade for technology as game changing as bitcoin is nothing.  In fact I'm pretty shocked at how fast it *is* propagating - everybody has at least heard of bitcoin now, which is far more than I can say this time a year ago.

Because Bitcoin cut out a lot of needless paperwork and allowed them to appeal to a global, young, tech savvy demographic that was hitherto out of reach to them.

You give far too much credence to the power of governments to control corporations and assume no politicians work in the light.  
Instead of assuming bad actors in government have a hand in any of this, instead look to the companies and individuals that stand to profit from having got into bed with VC's who, rather than seeing a technology capable of uniting humanity, see a product like any other that will enrich their portfolios and ROI.
It's not necessarily their fault that they lack the vision of seeing what bitcoin is truly capable of, any more than it was Bill Gate's 'fault' for not understanding that the internet was not a product to be exploited.
Case-in-point: Coinbase had to find that $1m per state for money transmitter licences from somewhere at the beginning.  And they have provided an important and valuable service to the ecosystem, bringing professionalism and order to a landscape that was blighted by Mt Gox and half-arsed attempts at growing this tech into something the 'big boys' would take seriously.
What they haven't been prepared for, perhaps, is how quickly the technology would evolve to the point where their USP is being deprecated by Layer 2 advances in the exact same way they positioned themselves against the incumbents they sought to disrupt.  
Same goes for bitpay and shapeshift (who act as intermediaries) if they don't pivot into something more worthwhile.  *This* is why you're seeing a backlash from the new incumbents, very little is to do with governments.

Actually quite the converse, BTC / Lightning Network payment channels are perfect for this when locked to an escrow smart contract...  Your Uber doesn't turn up?  Your AirBnB smart lock doesn't work or you need to cancel a spa bath appointment?  Your money is instantly refunded as per the smart contract agreed to by both parties, without any gatekeepers ever taking a cut or you needing to wait for your payment to be reversed by the bank.
Same holds true if you're selling a $10m condo that falls through at the last minute ;) 
So no, not terrible at all... quite revolutionary when it comes to web 3.0 contract space innovation...  but the *real* exciting stuff (at least for me) is where that all leads to when it intersects everything else...  we're really not going to recognise this world a decade from now :)

If we look at DCG they seem to have hedged their bets.  They're invested in BitGo and Blockstream on the other side of the 2X debate so it seems to me to be a classic VC play of expecting a whole bunch of their punts to fail whilst hoping he's managed to back at least one 'unicorn'.
That, or perhaps he's doing the same as Putin et al and just funding everyone on all sides knowing that eventually we'll find order amongst the chaos (which amounts to the same thing really).
Certainly if Barry is looking to save face that's a pretty good position he can take after this latest hurdle is surmounted.
In the meantime, everything is now in our hands.  If we want to show the old patriarchs who used to be in charge how a well organised non-hierarchical, leaderless system can outsmart those who want to control this technology, this is the kind of challenge we should all relish.
We just gotta' remember that no-one on any 'side' is perfect.  Have some of us acted stupidly?  Yes.  Lashed out and said things in hubris and anger?  Yes.  Are we all in love with this little project of ours and proud of how far we've all come together (despite our differences and all the stupid mistakes)?  Absolutely.    
We just need to breathe and keep supporting one another; realise we don't each have to carry the entire weight of the world at all times, since there's so many of us here now to pick up the slack.  
And, most importantly, we need to remember to enjoy the ride.

Nopes, it just needed segwit and the transaction malleability fixes that came with it...  2X should just (ostensibly) be a variable change that increases the blocksize; something the vast majority of computer scientists that built all this don't want to do until Lightning and the various changes that came with segwit have had a real chance to propagate.  Segwit is, in effect, a 2MB blocksize increase due to the many code optimisations that came with the upgrade.  
Meanwhile, business people think they have authority in what is largely a scientific / engineering and highly technical matter. 
I mean, I'm an *actual* computer scientist who has studied 2 CS degrees and been programming for 33 years (and know 17 different programming languages) and not even I feel qualified enough to have a truly well informed opinion on the scaling debate, since I haven't had long enough to sit down with the code to fully understand it... 
So God knows what it is that makes Barry Silbert and their flock of yesmen and women think qualifies them to have an opinion worth listening to on these matters.  They were just people in the right place at the right time that spotted a 'business opportunity' that have given them an uneven share of voice in this space...  Meanwhile the people that built it, did so not because of business or because they saw a get-rich-quick-scheme but because they saw it as a technology capable of transforming the world.
First thing we should ask anyone opening their mouth on this issue i:s "Can you code?  Are you a computer scientist?  Were you one of the 200 or so scientists that have contributed to core over the years?"
If the answer is no, take what they say with a pinch of salt.  If they have a vested monetary interest in maintaining the status quo (miners or intermediary services like bitpay taking commissions on bitcoin trades) toss that pinch of salt.
To put all this in another context: if this were say, Google... It would be like asking the head of the Human Resources department to weigh in on a debate as to whether, say, the WebRTC team should uhmmm (plucking some random issue out of thin air)... consider prioritising adding more robust support for ONC configurations for OpenVPN connections...
If the human resources lady were honest she would simply reply: "Errrr.  I don't have any expertise in those matters, but I'm happy to advise on the people we need to hire who will be able to help, since that *is* what I am knowledgable and passionate about..."
That's how we get the best out of people, and allow everyone in the ecosystem to contribute their diversity of talents in meaningful and proactive ways.
Many of those with opinions would be well advised to either a) learn computer science or b) go back to what they're good at and leave the science to the scientists before all the good guys and girls leave to find a group of people who *truly appreciate* their art and the magnificent work they have all done in building and maintaining the most robust, secure blockchain on Planet Earth.

It's actually very good for bitcoin this is happening.  The splintering of weak, average and greedy minds who fail to see reason and science, will rush headlong into this with no concept of the long term socio-economic problems bitcoin was built to solve.  They'll waste their own time and energy digging holes (but learning valuable lessons) whilst the scientists get on with the *real* work of building bridges to the new world.
And eventually, as each of those splinters lose clients, capital and credibility there can only be one inevitable conclusion to all of this:
**All rivers flow back to bitcoin - the idea.**

Do read up on Bram Cohen's proof of space whitepaper, which would result in eco-friendly mining.
Also do remember (in the UK at least) we only just this year retired our last coal mine and up until the 70's most electricity was generated via coal causing tremendous amounts of pollution. 
Every industry on the planet needs to start addressing their energy issues, including the crypto space.
Google are now running entirely off Green Energy so there's no longer an excuse for incumbent businesses to not start recognising the urgent need.
And certainly they don't get to play the moral high ground with bitcoin when so many scientists in this space (like Bram) are working *already* to solve those problems.  I mean, do businessinsider.com.au (the publisher of that article) run their servers off clean energy?  If not, why not when it's as simple as switching to Google cloud or, in the very least, carbon offsetting.

mp3 was invented in 1989.  It would take roughly 10 years for Napster to pull the technology from the super geeky IRC underground and set it free amongst the ordinary masses.
I had a programmer friend who had invented a much better mp3 compression algorithm at around the same time Napster began to take off...   He spent 6 years of his life trying to get people to adopt his bigger, faster, stronger algo, but to no avail.
I tried to explain that even though his invention was incredible and vastly superior to mp3... ordinary people don't care much about the nuances of the technology under the hood; they only care about the magic they can accomplish with the new technology and the utility/joy it adds to their lives.

Because *it is*.  Alan's fight was with a system that *wrongly* outlawed homosexuality.  
Aaron's was with a system that *wrongly* outlaws information that should be free, and denies access to a whole host of academics, politicians and ordinary folk who are trying to make the world a better place but can't simply because they happen to be from the wrong geographical location, or don't have enough money in their bank account.
Case-in-point: Just weeks after Aaron's death a 15 year old kid invented a new Cancer Test 10X more sensitive &amp; 26,000X cheaper than current tests - the kid happened to develop this because he was one of the privileged few who have access to JSTOR and the (largely) publicly funded information within.  How many more breakthroughs are waiting around the corner when Indian doctors (for instance) have egalitarian access to information that *should* be in the public domain?
How self-evident will it become to mankind that the current system is wrong years down the line, that millions are people are suffering because access to information is restricted and profited from?
It is only with hindsight that we feel Alan's pain was justified, yet at the time the view would have been "well homosexuality is against the law.  He suffered the consequences." which is the prevailing view of many people regarding Aaron's actions.
Yet, we know that the law is wrong, we feel this innately, we know that the prospect of 35 years in jail should he wish to protest his innocence is wrong, we know that the punishment does not fit the crime.  
Just as we now know that it was wrong just 40 years ago to think it was ok to subject homosexuals to chemical castration and/or prison sentences.

I'm not sure, I think it depends on your style of teaching.  I personally have no problem with kids swearing provided it is appropriate and not just rude or insulting for the sake of it.  13 year olds are young adults and it would be naive to think they aren't using that kind of language when adults aren't around.  Therefore it can be just as constructive to allow that language within certain contexts, teaching them when and why it is and isn't appropriate.  
I know I had a teacher (funnily enough an IT teacher) that took this approach, and insisted his students only call him by his first name, allowing swearing within certain contexts.  As a result he earned a great deal of camaraderie and warmth from his pupils who felt they were treated with and given more respect as the young adults they were.  This often saw us sharing opinions and ideas that we might otherwise have been too scared to air in front of the more stricter teachers.  On the whole, I think this style can be a tremendously positive thing when preparing people for the 'real' world.

I'm glad others see this too.  I take solace in knowing how much we've progressed as a species in such a short period of time.  In the past - when much of the world were barely literate - people couldn't read books in their heads (they could only read outloud).  Those who mastered the art of reading would silently read (in their heads) texts written by their friends and, as party tricks, retell the stories to the utter astonishment of those around them.
I think we'll look back on this mini dark age where we thought it was OK for false idols, emperors and corporations with 'power' to blatantly manipulate the truth for their own selfish means via news and media spokespeople... and be completely perplexed as to how vast swathes of humanity lacked the basic critical thinking skills to see through the manipulation.

[Money is just a measurement tool]( that only has 'value' because of our inter-subjective belief systems that agree it does.  It was long ago decoupled from actual 'wealth', and its concentration in the hands of the few, coupled with a system that measures 'success' alongside GDP and economic 'growth' has meant the profit incentive has lead to a world where it's OK to cheat to 'get to the top', OK to create companies that have no '[WHY?]( beyond the creation of money itself. 
As a result we have people running around the globe throwing 'money' not at the creation of real wealth capable of transforming people and the planet and solving the many problems we face as a species... but on cheap plastic trinkets and ideas that perpetuate the kind of greed and waste that has lead to the West throwing a way a third of its food whilst a third of the world lives close to starvation, whilst those western societies stuck on a treadmill of consumerist 9-5 suffer the highest rates of depression and obesity we've ever seen as a species (suicide now kills more people than natural disasters and war combined)...  This hangover from the Gordon Gecko 'greed is good' mantra of the 80's, is largely being felt because money and GDP are terrible metrics to use to ascertain the happiness, health, well-being and true wealth creation potential of our societies.  


It is that exact "fuck it! someone elses problem" and lack of imagination and empathy for others outside the nuclear family that has lead to the greed, apathy and disparity of wealth we see today.  And of course [we know that the more unequal societies are the more everyone suffers]( including those at the 'top' of that money pyramid.
The funny thing is, with people like Ray Kurzweil (head of Google Engineering) predicting the technological singularity is as near as 2029 we are now very close to [age reversal and immortality]( becoming actual reality, which begs the question "would you be less of an asshole if death was no longer the end state?".  
Sci-Fi aside... the contributions you make to help build a better world leaves an imprint in time long after you are gone.  Those statues, Google doodles, hollywood biopics...  they are your shot at immortality, of leaving a legacy that will bring happiness and joy to others long after you are gone.  Funny isn't it, how none of those statues or Google doodles honour people for simply having made a bunch of 'money' during their lifetimes.  
We might get used to the idea that our digital histories too will form just as an important part of our legacy, especially when web of trust networks become *as* important as old world 'money' was, when transacting in the new world.

Nawwww, all the people who built this have done is replicate a heavily crippled version of the AirBnB experience and added a payment option that is restricted to 0.00001% of the population presently.  It's not complex to do any of this nor is it particularly exciting or groundbreaking.  Indeed, I could have a fairly simple alpha running in a day or two that would work perfectly but it's not really solving a huge problem or doing anything interesting with this amazing technology.
The complex part, AirBnB have already done in building a trusted network with Web 2.0 tech and a huge userbase that isn't going to suddenly abandon them because somebody has rather naively built a competing service that simply targets a very niche demographic that soon Airbnb itself will be able to cater for.  
Adding an additional Web 3.0 payment layer and bolting in stuff like blockstack global ID and the myriad cross-over options into hardware - such as physical smart locks linked to rootstock contracts that allow instant rental via an augmented reality app showing available properties in your nearby area that can be unlocked with a phone after payment... that's gonna' be where this all starts to really take off, boosted by the existing userbases of these tech giants on-boarding because this tech is **actually enabling users to do exciting new stuff that wasn't possible before** (besides quick payments)...  To do this means taking a long time understanding the new opportunities and rolling them out in a safe and responsible way that makes sense to the 99.9% of people in the world it needs to reach.

Jamie's statement suggesting Bitcoin wasn't legalised in Japan, is false.
See: [Japan is set to begin recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting tomorrow](  [Vietnam]( and myriad other governments have also made moves to recognise BTC as a formal payment method.
As for Jamies other comments:
The wonderful Nick Colas from Convergex Group tackled pretty much every point Jamie raised wayyy back in 2013 on Bloomberg.
[Video Link - On Bitcoin's Legitimacy](
*"If you are a U.S. buyer of bitcoin your institution is regulated by U.S. law, so there is not total anonymity...80% of US Dollar bills go outside the U.S. and how many times do you see news of a drug bust where there are stacks and stacks of hundred dollar bills?  The fact that a currency is used for illicit activity doesn't make it immoral or illegitimate... " — Nick Colas*
As for Jamie's knee-jerk (borderline xenophobic) comments on bitcoin being used in places like Venezuela, here's an explanation from Chamath Palihapitiya in 2013 who talks about bitcoin being used in this context as a proactive way to *solve* problems ordinary people are facing in those countries.
[Video Link - Bitcoin [is] a Huge, Huge, Huge Deal!](
*"I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fun, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. Because what you're talking about right now is, for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right? The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government. It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina. Everywhere you have currency pressure. Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. And then, after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism." 
— Chamath Palihapitiya*

It's not.  No-one controls the bitcoin network, as we're finding out with 2X.


Nothing, thinking outside the normative social influence is the only thing thing that keeps pushing us forward.  As such, you're talking to someone who helped keep the internet as we know it today, free; I and many others of my generation (and the wise elders in the generations below) have been through a fair bit of shit for the average internet user, so that you might enjoy places like Reddit and Wikipedia.


There is no real system.  The world is completely rudderless, no-one is really in control.  I think many people living in fear don't realise this, and there's a propensity for those that feel powerless and confused by the conflicting noise and information out there to long for an apocalypse so they can be the 'good guy' that takes up arms and protects the weak.  When in reality, the rules we've established as societies is bringing about a much, much less violent world, which is stripping Patriarchs of the "shock and awe" persuasion (who get a kick out of violence and force) of all their power and, in some cases, meaning and purpose.  
No long lasting peace ever came from bloodshed, dialogue is the only way.
Bitcoin is no different in that respect.
Peace man.  And thanks for being so vocal in your support of bitcoin.  You spreading the message amongst family and friends is just as important as the lines of code being written every day to keep the network (and idea) secure.

Agreed, but really it's about simply upgrading existing corporate structures and instilling transparency at every level of the organisation and removing hierarchies.  Think of Web of Trust style networks so that entities like AirBnB can run much more like Bitcoin Core itself does, with the users or 'patreons' supporting the site getting not only a stake in the site but also in its future and governance.  Same with Uber and even Google and Facebook longer term.
There are obviously a lot of stealth projects going on in YC, BoostVC and the like...  Be interesting to see how they embrace Layer 2...  I would dearly love to see lots of tech mergers.  Facebook and Uber going to war against Google+ and Cab companies is silly and, in the longrun just hurts users and stymies progress.  But the work these companies have already done building up their userbase and tech / networks need not be lost, nor do codebases need to be rewritten from scratch.
I think in the future, the idea that a CEO could earn 1000x more than the lowest paid worker and that we had all this secrecy around salaries, ideas, intellectual property, will be seen as the single biggest obstacle blocking human progress.
Obviously, a lot has to change around the way we *think* about the world, but no more so than it did when the internet disrupted everything from media moguls to the post office and stock market.

Similar to how the autonomous region of Wales has distinct culture / language / governance models from England even though they are primarily 'ruled' via parliamentary process in England.  
Those perceived differences aside, Welsh *people* have far more in common with the English than they do, say, the French, and are an intrinsic part of the wider territory of Great Britain.  
Indeed, there are a great deal many Welsh people over in the English parliament influencing how England is run, just as there are Scottish and Irish.  Same is true, of Hong Kong residents working in governance, corporations and academia from mainland China and vice versa.

Here's [an academic study from SSRN with contributions from researchers at the University of Manchester and Montreal University]( ) showing that, far from increasing drug-related deaths, dark markets like the Silkroad actually lead to a decrease in street violence and deaths associated with impurity of drugs.  It also reduces the 'gateway drug' effect that leads say, casual cannabis users, onto harder stuff.
Authors: *Judith Aldridge, University of Manchester - School of Law* &amp; *David Décary-Hétu, University of Montreal - School of Criminology*
[Related Wired Article citing the above paper](
Author: *Andy Greenberg, 3 June 2014*
Also [see this Wikipedia article]( on the huge net positive effect on society decriminalising drugs in Portugal has had over the last decade, where addiction to hard drugs was seen as a treatable illness as opposed to a crime. 
[This groundbreaking Lancet study]( authored by Professor David Nutt, shows conclusively that *alcohol* is still (by far) the most harmful drug in Western society by quite an order of magnitude.  Note the paper is not calling for us to ban alcohol.  We know of course from the failure of Alcohol Prohibition in America in the 1920's, that banning a substance does not work.  It lead to a huge increase in violent crime and alcohol related deaths due to impurities and gang violence.  In addition, law enforcement and the judiciary were more susceptible to bribery as they themselves ended up in the pockets of illegal alcohol dealers.
Ultimately, as with all addiction (alcohol, coffee, gambling, fast food, shopping, work, video gaming) responsibility must lie with the individual.  And society, rather than pre-emptively threatening them with a big stick, must instead be there to pick them up if they fall down, just as you might were it your own friends or family members.

No joke, one of Satoshi's accounts was reactivated briefly to say "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" years back (during the Dorian affair).  Nothing to say that they/she/he wouldn't weigh in on such a decision.
Whilst fom a technical perspective it's certainly feasible,  I feel our entire relationship to money/property/ownership would need to change before such a decision might gain concensus. 
Pine (from pineapple fund) once said "when you have enough money, money doesn't matter anymore"... This is where *everyone* needs to get to.  Let's remember Satoshi didn't create Bitcoin as a get rich scheme.  It's much more than that...
Of course major changes like this would require the entire community to get behind it in a similar way to the UASF.  
Money is just a social convention; it's changed many times in the past and this species of ours is still very much in its infancy.  We can all feel it's once again changing as that consumerist hangover that had so many worshipping the material, passes.

I would base it on inventions and technology that have most changed the world and, in doing so, helped humanity move forward toward closer unity.  For me, I see all the world as one, everybody as equal in much the same way astronauts describe the 'astronaut overview effect' giving them a profound sense of 'oneness'.  I spent half of my life traveling this globe, everywhere is incredible for different reasons and we are all part of the same family, completely connected and reliant on each other.
The UK, through accident of geography (tiny, lush, green, fertile island with no predators or natural disasters to worry about) has been able to do all kinds of things other nations haven't and is perhaps the closest representation to a united humanity we have.  Probably because they were the first of 'the great pirates' to sail the uncharted seas...
They basically started the home computer revolution, video games, and of course the internet itself.  Before that, railroads and the industrial revolution and the actual invention of the computer via Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage.
Adam Smith came up with modern economic theory, Darwin the theory of evolution, the modern Welfare State was created there.  They invented modern law during colonial times and, indeed, this is what America used to establish its place in the world (the original pilgrims coming from the UK of course).  
Unlike America, laws and restrictions in the UK can change overnight, hence the majority of bitcoin companies flocked to 'Silicon Roundabout' in London (where Google Campus are located).  It also has a language that is constantly evolving (the Oxford English dictionary is revised each year) whereas other countries languages, like France, stand still.  
If we are to accept that reality as we understand it is made out of language (we form an idea in the mind through words, ideas are what inform and shape the world around us)... then naturally, should we wish to keep evolving as a society, language and law needs to be able to keep up with those changes.
This means world changing innovations like the internet can happen without being stifled by old laws...  And, of course, the UK is a gateway to Europe, the Commonwealth abroad and as such, the biggest exporter in terms of art, poetry and music by virtue of English being closest to us having a universal language of the world (would Vietnam anti-war movement in the 60's gained the traction it did without english exports like Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones and The Beatles?).  
Education is a key factor too: Oxford and Cambridge remain the top 2 universities on the planet.  
There's also the fact it's largely secular; their Prime Minister using Christianity as a selling point during political debates would be a turn-off for the populace.  There is no "In God We Trust" on the money, instead their money pays homage to *people* like Darwin, Churchill, Elizabeth Fry, Jane Austen...
Not to mention... Harry Potter! :D

None of us can see into the future.  Talking in absolutes makes us all look as hubristic as the "the world will never need more than 5 computers guy" from IBM.
Truth is, 2008 *was* the meltdown and if bitcoin does its job over the next 10 years the rug will slowly be pulled until one day humanity realises the entire world has changed...  We need no more chaotic misery and panic for that inevitability to play out, only patience.

The other alternative is to put all our faith in the technology of fiat currency (96% of which is digital zipping around inside computers).  
Both the technologies of fiat currency *and* bitcoin is more about the people behind those technologies, and what ordinary people do with them.
P.S. A post above mentions the documentary was from 2014, which was a few hundred 'thought years' ago in BST (Bitcoin Space Time).  Many people who used to think like the guy in that documentary have come full circle.  This happened with the internet too, and before that home computers (I remember my English teacher laughing and telling me computers were just a passing fad).  
Bitcoin no longer has to 'prove' itself as viable.  We'd do well to avoid putting up links to false idols and non 'experts' telling us what can or cannot be.  Even if that is in an attempt to show them up for being ignorant.  Schadenfreude is not helpful, it puts the very ordinary people we want onboard with this into fight or flight and makes us all look like a group of cackling know-it-alls.
Don't forget, we were ALL ignorant of this technology at some point.

You may be right, but that shows little thought on what the ramifications of a transparent global public ledger means for the world when pitted against a broken system that hitherto thrived on the reckless pursuit of profits and required cheating at the highest of levels.  
Of course the 99.9% of ordinary hard working citizens of the world who were innocently trapped in the gears of that machine have nothing to fear from a more open public ledger - unencumbered by those old world gatekeepers - who have proven time and time again they can't be trusted with the security of our personal data or the sound management of our assets.

You're talking to someone who was here back when there was only one exchange and had to ride the entire MtGox shitstorm (and every one that has come since).
Bitcoiners advice on this matter is consistent: if you have bitcoin on an exchange it is not yours and your coins will always be at risk, just as the fiat in your bank account is open to the kind of risks that come from capital controls and the bail-ins we saw in Cyprus...
So your advice is great, your reasoning however (and invocation of conspiracy theories) is nonsensical and based on zero empirical evidence to support your claims.  
I know you mean well, but you cannot on one hand get angry at MSM and people like Dimon spreading FUD without evidence to back up their claims, and then go do it yourself when it suits you to spin your own fantasy narrative.

Yeah exactly, same reason you won't shout "Nigger" at someone down the street (even though in the past it was perfectly acceptable).  Since we know it is going to offend some people, we choose, as a society, to refrain from causing offence.  Doesn't mean you can't use that language with your best black friends who know you're not racist and just trying to fit in with their culture, but infront of a stranger?  It's a no-no.  
We know that racism, sexism and all that bullshit old skool patriarchal thinking has to go, we know there's no real difference between girls and boys brains, we know that the best conversations we have are when we put lust and base instincts behind us, look deeply into the eyes of the other person and truly get inside their heads... so as good citizens of the internet representing bitcoin, if we want to build the world in that kind of image, we ought think about being inclusive and ensuring everyone is afforded the same kind of courtesy we'd expect ourselves.
You want more women in this space to have those deep and meaningful conversations with?  Make it a place where they feel equal and appreciated for who they are and what they carry inside, not what they look like.

Next week's lottery numbers are of no interest to oracles.
They are more interested in long-term trends.  
For example: I can look to the past in the UK and see there was a time before there was such a thing as a lottery (it arrived here in the early 90s).  
Is there a point in the future at which there will be no lottery?  Why might that happen?  
Perhaps the nation will lose its love affair with money and gambling?  Perhaps it will be replaced by a people powered crypto lottery?  
The latter is more likely to happen sooner than the former.  What are the probabilities and timelines of each?  What processes might we start putting together to see that future unfolding 5-10-20 years down the line?
Here's a modern day oracle called Ray Kurzweil and the many [Predictions he's been making]( since the 70s.  A large proportion of them have come true, partly because he made them and people around him worked to ensure they came true because they all sounded rather lovely ;)

Yes, there's a lot of nut-cases who are often louder than they ought to be, but for every one of them, there's a thoughtful, intelligent guy/girl sat in the corner with their head down just getting on with shit.
And in this diversity there is a unity of strength, belief and hope for a better future that crosses into all strata.  If you don't see that, you don't get bitcoin *or* the community.

Speak for yourself.  I have been doing far from 'nothing'.  Indeed, I, like many others, have dedicated the last 7 years of my life to all this; the last 3 of which I have spent talking to politicians, law makers, governors, lawyers, regulators and many others in that old world to figure out how this process (which needs to be gradual) will work.
In the UK at least, lawyers are leaving old world companies in their droves to lithe new startups founded by computer scientists on the edge of all this, who see everything from real estate to the way we think about small claims and insurance being disrupted.
**Everything requires patience**, something the millennial generation find hard to come to terms with since they have been bred to specialise in various niches of Computer Science (unlike [the generation that came before]( who were making it all up as they went along since it was so new and there was nothing to specialise in... as such, they became [the first true polymaths]( in the burgeoning field of Computer Science).
The good news is, there's so much scope in this new world for a plethora of talents and abilities, all you need be asking yourself is "what am I passionate about?" for you to find some small group or project that you can get involved with that is *truly* capable of changing the world.
There is no excuse for passively observing and 'dreaming about this new world'.  if you can think you can make a positive impact, roll your sleeves up and get involved.

Thankyou for all your support Munich! 
It is great to see the global grassroots community coming together around this ahead of time.
Let announcements like this serve as stark reminder to all industry participants with a stake in this ecosystem, that the bitcoin network (and businesses built around it) wouldn't be where they are today were it not for the widespread support of the ordinary hard working people that form these kinds of meetup groups.  i.e. the *very people* bitcoin - the technology - was created to enrich the lives of.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:36:56


In order for that to happen we need to let them go their own way and for them to come to this realisation themselves and, just as importantly, we need to be there for them when they fall.  When atomic swaps are ready, it's really not gonna' make much difference which alt people use anyway so we need not fear one side becomes immediately extinct.  I have no doubt that all rivers will eventually flow back into BTC, but there's no reason Alts that have a real interesting USP shouldn't remain an integral part of all this.  
Perhaps B2X and BCH will satisfy that remit as they mature.  Even as alternate near-identical clones of BTC, they serve an interesting utility.  For example we might envision a service that provides 'triple blockchain lock-in' of assets further down the line.  If you sold your house, or a government converted land registry in their country to blockchain, would you want 3 independently maintained blockchains recording the data for redundancy purposes?  Perhaps.
It may be that Voorhees, Garzik et al will make a good stab at bringing many of the old world financial systems over to bitcoin (SALT lending for instance may be an important baby step to pulling that old world toward the new) as long as it doesn't impact the more important (at least to me) work of using bitcoin to bring the world together and move us toward a resource based economy and one-world type global citizenry and governance infrastructure.  
Just as with Mike Hearn going to R3CEV kept the banks busy, why not allow B2X / DCG to keep those who don't see the bigger vision computer scientists have for bitcoin keeping financial incumbents busy too? 


Short term, 4 hour block times (or longer) are necessary growing pains.  The ecosystem will accept this comes with the territory, just as we accepted Mt. Gox crashes and the myriad infrastructure hacks we've all absorbed over the years was part of the process of bitcoin growing up.  Nothing changes in terms of security of user funds, or the integrity of the people maintaining the code base.  
If anything, riding through this last storm just further cements that Core (and users and supporters of core) will go through hell and back to make this project a success, no matter what the odds.  Which just further cements the faith we all have in them as the exact kind of custodians we need for this technology.
Long term if mining difficulty is a problem, it will of course have to be addressed but is nothing that code cannot fix.  Realistically though, I very much doubt mining is going to look like this in a year from now anyway.  We all want some kind of eco-friendly system if we are to remain true to the vision of using this technology to have the greatest impact for good in the world, and the crazy mining race we've seen (and centralisation of power it has lead to) needs to end.  Bram Cohen's eco-friendly Proof of Space whitepaper looks interesting, as does the Vega Home Miner 14nm chips coming out of Dubai, as does Midea announcing they're looking at consumer-level chips.


Tl;DR: There's no 'winning'; bitcoin impacts way too much and way too many disciplines for any one 'side' to have a clear overview of all the intersections that lay ahead...  There are just myriad technical and cognitive concessions to be made by every 'side' with a stake in building this new future ahead.  We get there by acknowledging all 'sides' with humility, kindness and forgiveness (we've all been wrong a million times about bitcoin since day one after all and it would be disingenuous to suggest any of us had a clear handle on the best way forward).

Remember we've had everything thrown at us (economists, bankers, alt-right, alt-left, politicians, governments)...  The list is long.

It's both actually.  Without the good intentions and support of the community, engineers, coders and designers (such as myself) would have no-one to pitch their ideas to in this space.  No initiative would have gotten off the ground without this support, including the original idea itself.
If you get off your arse and get actively involved, message people / go to meets, you will find that most people in this community will bend over backwards to pitch in and help; with whatever skillset / means they may have at their disposal - even if this is merely making introductions / lending advice and ideas or just simply keeping morale up by buying people the odd beer (Cheers :) ).  And what's more, in my experience, people do these things without expecting anything in return, which is pretty damn unique in this world of dog-eat-dog.

It is indeed a beautiful eulogy and one that is hard to dismiss.  But it is also a scapegoat, a shrug of the shoulders and a "well shit, that's just the way the world is."  To say no-one in his life helped him cope, we must include in that list MIT, the state and the system itself that lead to his abuse.
It is the same situation that Alan Turing faced in an unjust and unfair system that saw fit to outlaw homosexuality.  The UK government recently issued a formal apology for their treatment of Alan; it is clear that had homosexuality not been outlawed, had he not been subjected to chemical castration then it is very likely he would have lead a happy and fulfilling life.  Instead he chose suicide as the only solace from the pain and misery wrought on him by a system that defied logic and reason and was lacking in empathy.
In years to come we will look on these dark post 9/11 times of fear, uncertainty and state overreach in the same way we look back on the era of slavery and civil rights abuse...and we will realise that a great deal of us stood by and did nothing while good people suffered.  Aaron understood and had great empathy for those suffering injustice, and it is ironic perhaps, that this was the very reason he was so relentlessly pursued by prosecutors.
We are all partially responsible for being complicit in the ills that have lead to good people choosing to exit this world, and none more so than those who simply shrug their shoulders and conclude "well that's just the way it is."

I bring DarkWallet into the equation simply because it was *so* controversial and yet still raised some $50k or so...The thought being, if a project like that can attract such funding, then the core itself should be able to raise this kind of investment in the order of magnitudes. 


Exactly, and countless bitcoin related ventures were invested in last year (to the tune of $600million).  If core fails, they all fail.
Needless to say it's in their (and everyones) best interest to ensure bitcoin core is as robust and agile as it possibly can be, ergo, it makes sense for VC's and the crowd to help bootstrap a support and funding structure that ensure it remains stable, productive and, above all, neutral.

Seconded.  Many of the people who lost sight of the wider vision through their own hubris and impatience have been fundamental in helping us get to where we are today and, however you feel about their vision, they are still out there talking to ordinary everyday people about bitcoin, who will themselves get to make up their own minds about which 'flavour' works for them.

Reflects only a rudimentary understanding of Bitcoin.  
Did the 'market' decide after the Mt.Gox crash?  Or the 1000s of other times the 'market' decided bitcoin was dead but was dead wrong?
Nopes.  Computer scientists who understood that the technical failures of Mt. Gox and wider infrastructure issues had no bearing on the long term trajectory of bitcoin - the idea, decided what happened next.  
Lessons learnt?  Market does not understand science and price is not indicative of future trajectory of the technology, any more than it had bearing on Amazon shares when they crashed after a wave of dot-com panics.  
Ultimately, there is only one thing that decides long term - the community.

Agreed.  There are enough people within bitcoin to ensure core devs are funded via a completely neutral platform.

By that logic, Wikipedia should never have been funded, and yet here it is raising millions from the crowd every year, having been bootstrapped by a few affluent philanthropists in the early days.

Better to stick to science and facts and leave stuff like this to the horoscopes section.  Especially if the research has been 'sponsored' by a firm with skin in the game.  This is no better than big pharma or the petroleum industry paying for favourable results.
IMO the real things *actually* happening right now are far more exciting than speculating on the future.

If you are antsy about being involved in bitcoin, I can understand, but with so many politicians, governments, celebrities and ordinary people getting involved, it's a pretty beautiful and lovely place.
Remember we've gone from 10,000 subscribers to 350,000 in the last 4 years.  It was really a more stressful time at the beginning, although everyone believed in it enough to know people would embrace it eventually.
Kinda' like back in the day when we were all building the internet (an equally radical technology that scared a lot of people).
Keep the faith.  Thanks again for your support.

I think Roger's gonna' be ok now to be honest.  He's working on some Galt's Gulch type libertarian 'paradise' for them all so that should keep him busy (in a good way).

Funny thing is about that Karma btw - way I see AI algorithms working in the future through things like the [Perspective API]( is all that toxicity bad actors have put out there onto the internet and attached to their online personas will one day come back to them when we bootstrap Global ID and equate online Karma on reddit and social networks with real economic energy.
Steemit is a good example of this, but there's no reason it can't work posthumously with an alt currency married up with facebook, reddit, twitter working in tandem with atomic swaps to give all your online contributions (past and present) actual 'real world' value.
This is exactly the same type of system Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen envisioned in their book [The New Digital Age]( btw.
It will be interesting to see how that affects people working in the shadows on all this.

Given that Brits represent the most diverse mashup of ideas, ethnicities and cultures on the planet, you are quite right in saying that there really is no one person that can 'represent' us Brits.  It is perhaps as a result of this diversity of ideas (and the fact our 'Great Pirate' ancestors who travelled the entire globe) that we are often on the forefront of cultural progression. 
This is perhaps most clear when we think to how Brits were the progenitors of the industrial revolution, ideas of universal free healthcare and the welfare state, women's rights and indeed, Darwin's theory of evolution and the invention of the world wide web... Heck, even capitalism and modern commerce itself originally came from the ideas of Adam Smith.
We've never had Revolutions in the UK, just myriad Reformations that come as a result of us being on such a tiny island where everyone needs to get along for the greater good of the group.  That history, rich access to free education for all, and trademarked self-deprecating British humour, coupled with the fact English is the universal language, gives us an insight into why so many ideas and shifting cultural values originate from such a tiny little island.

Depends if you want to be a flash-in-the-pan AOL Online or you want your bitcoin business to be here in 2 years time when Layer 2, mining and the BTC protocol itself looks completely different to where we are today, as will exchanges and other bitcoin businesses that rely on taking commissions from users when atomic swaps and decentralised exchanges begin rolling out.  Ultimately users will go with services that best suit their needs (which was the whole USP of coinbase et al in the first place, given they were supposed to be a better alternative to old world commission taking outfits).
If you want to last the distance, then you will recognise that hashpower is a red herring and you'd do well to start building bridges to those working on Layer 2 (who nearly all champion core since, well, they're computer scientists who grok where all this leads).

Right, I agree with money not being the only objective (in fact it's probably the least interesting problem facing core dev).  MIT being heavily entrenched in the interests of government and big business, whilst having their tentacles in the bitcoin pie is something that concerns me.  And here's why...
Having heard Gavin and Mike Hearn speaking in London just last week during a Q&amp;A session, it became clear to me that there are 2 very distinct schools of thought going on in Core Dev.  
Mike is very much along the lines of "fuck consensus, it takes too long, I just wanna' build shit my way, 'cause I know best" whereas Gavin seemed far more humble, recognising the importance of keeping bitcoin a product of dialogue between the crowd, and, most importantly that development happen with no formalised hierarchy.  Whilst Gavin recognises that this is massively time-consuming, his view would perhaps be that reaching consensus - with no one voice having more value than any another - is a core principle that must be upheld if bitcoin is to remain true to its original mission.
As soon as we introduce entities like MIT, with hierarchy, meritocracy and structural control baked-in, agendas will take precedence and simply drown out the crowd, even if that's bad for bitcoin's neutrality.
You are right that we need all the help we can get, which is why I go back to crowd-based decision making (and funding) and the wisdom that comes with the many as the only sane way something as ground-breaking as bitcoin can remain truly politically and ideologically neutral.  That doesn't mean that all the talent at MIT can't get onboard, it just means that their voice can be no louder than that of a Russian coder with no formal qualifications working out of his basement.

This is not a Hollywood movie.
Bitcoin is just code and at any point the community (via consensus) could decide to freeze or change the keys to those coins in the event of an emergency.
Although I imagine they would be put to better use eventually, such as a worldwide [alms giving] ( fund administered by the crowd to help provide global welfare coverage and the like.
Long way to go before we get there though.

Exactly.  The 'First they ignore you.  Then they fight you.' stages became impossible when there is nothing to attack but a shadow.  And when your 'adversary' speaks the truth from an anonymous computer terminal.
Which forced a conversation on the true nature of money to happen in the upper echelons of 'power' for the first time in hundreds of years.  
The result is a swathe of people coming over from the 'dark side' to embrace this next great phase of human ingenuity and creativity.  
The real force in all of this is not the technology itself, but the wave of positivity and new possibilities that the old system had rendered inert.  You can feel this unstoppable energy in the meetups, and in the cross-section of unlikely allies sat around brainstorming new ideas.  Positivity is contagious.
This metamorphosis is as transformative as the internet, the printing press and the industrial revolution itself.  And when everyone realises we're all on the same side, it's truly beautiful.
The only question left is "what do we want to do as a species when there's no longer anything to fight for?"

I know right, the entire documentary (ZMF) actually holds the key to how we deploy bitcoin to bring about an era of abundance (bitcoin + rootstock + atomic swaps) *is* the resource based monitoring system Peter Joseph had us all thinking about back in 2010... Coupled with the Venus Project, we have a basic blueprint for transcending the dark ages we've all just gone through.  
Of course getting people to watch a 3hr30min documentary and asking them to think deeply about these things is half the battle we face in that medieval world governed by neon lights and false idols.  This community however, tells us there is much light on the horizon.  
Thanks for watching :)

Surely we can all agree that **censorship resistance** from nefarious actors is what gives bitcoin its *true* security. 
If a small coterie of companies backed by miners, ruled by one developer with a clear conflict of interest can hijack the network, then the blockchain and your funds are no longer secure and may as well be locked up in a centralised SQL payment hub managed by the same people, since it opens them up to all kinds of coercion from external actors with vested interests.
It begins with that one dev and a handful of companies saying "let's just tweak the blocksize against the will of consensus" and ends with "let's just ban all these countries / people our bosses don't like".  And thus, we begin the slippery descent back to the very dark place of inequality bitcoin was built to enable good citizens to transcend.
Corporations who seek to exert control over bitcoin (and by extension those citizens) might need to get used to the concept of emergency PoW changes deployed as a means to easily resist this kind of trojan horse takeover attempt in future.

As the price of green energy solutions increasingly dwarf fossil fuels we will no doubt witness just how simple it is to harness that energy en masse and move toward a more friendly, harmonious world and a collaborative, sharing economy that *truly* economlses.
Since that future is now so closely correlated with what happens in the digital world we can perhaps see the open source revolution happening in cyberspace as a precursor to all this.

Au contraire Neil.  We absolutely can - in our minds... and in doing so, we effect *actual* reality.  
When Steve Jobs delivered his [Stanford Commencement speech]( in 2005 he said the following:
"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."  
Looking back on our past enables us to look to it from different perspectives, gain new insights and *change that past*.  We've all had that "Aha!" moment when new information in the present casts our understanding of past events in a new light and we then reorder our memories... In doing so, we effectively *change* that past.  
You're probably familiar with the maxim:
"Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past." — George Orwell
Things get really interesting when we *collectively* begin to re-order our understanding of the past.  In fact, that's what's going on in the bitcoin world en masse, as millions of people began to ask "Why did Henry T. Ford say there would be revolution before breakfast if the average person understood banking?"
As politicians and ordinary folk on the street begin to look into the history of banking and have collective "Aha!" moments, those (no doubt with good intentions) who sought to control the past have less and less authority over the present.  Just as those that sought to maintain segregation during the civil rights movements of the past began to lose their grip of that particular reality.
And so we begin to look toward a different future as a new adjacent possible comes into view.
That future is a battleground of ideas and information. They who have greater access to truthful information in this new collaborative era are better able to join those dots moving forward since there is less noise to cut through and, more importantly, less competition over ideas of what that future might look like thanks to consensus driven frameworks that allow the best ideas to take hold with less friction. 
**The greatest force multiplier on the planet has always been technology.**  
Steve Jobs was able to time travel 10 years into the future by imagining a world of smartphones in his minds eye and convincing the world to go in that direction.  Satoshi was able to do the same with the bitcoin whitepaper.  Before satoshi, Tim Berners-Lee who imagined what a world where every computer was connected might look like.  Before him, Captains of the great pirate ships that controlled information and trade routes and were the first humans to realise (and see the implications of) the world not being flat.
Whilst no-one has absolute control or authority over the future since there are way too many chaotic events that will unfold as the dots are being joined...  one can attempt to "fight all the battlegrounds of ideas at once" in the minds eye, and instantiate 'backup plans' for the various possible futures that may unfold.  In fact governments and think tanks are thinking 10-50 years ahead all the time - it's how we've gotten this far as a species. 
Computer scientists and engineers are very good at building backup plans.  Taking unintended consequences into account is what all good programmers do when designing fail-safe systems.
The complex part the modern world has faced in all this has been keeping up with the sheer pace of change now that the moving variables (and unintended outcomes) are being compounded by the speed of instantaneous (and democratised) information transfer that the internet has brought about... Consensus driven 'hive mind' networks like bitcoin will increasingly be used to augment the role of old world institutions that used to do all this in the paper-belt world.  
**None of this is new.**
In antiquity the role of shaping the future of humanity was carried out by the [Pythia]( - high priestesses of the Delphi in Ancient Greece - who would make a number of prophesies that people would act upon.  These Oracles would give advice intended to shape future action, which would be implemented by the supplicant seeking advice.  These supplicants would be known as "consultants" and would leave the Oracles and carry out certain duties on the basis of their advice.  By virtue of the wide-ranging information networks the Pythia had been exposed to they were, in essence, polymaths 
There were other oracles (or prophets) like Jesus, Moses, able to do a similar thing...  Note how well travelled they were in the stories and the sheer amount of novelty they had been exposed to above and beyond the average citizen.  They too were polymaths able to shape the future and change reality in profound ways.
Amazing material scientists like Neil who fail to see reality is made out of language and thought... get all caught up on the whole "did Jesus exist?" thing and rather miss the point... Carl Sagan (my favourite scientist of all time) even missed this when he said "Astrology is bunk, the position of the planets at your birth has far less effect than the gravitational pull of the midwife delivering you."  
That's irrelevant: all that matters is that the inter-subjective systems of belief that dictate the alignment of those stars will define the kind of character traits you are likely to have in life...  That, and the attachment we have to the various symbology we surround ourselves with that imbue those belief systems with certain powers (Scorpions are scary and dangerous, Lions are brave and noble etc).  A [Nazar amulet](youtube.com) wards off evil in the exact same way a modern depiction of the iris below a CCTV camera sign does.
So... if enough people in China believe a person being born in the year of the Fire Dragon is going to be a great powerful leader then they are going to subconsciously give preference to Fire Dragons over, say, Water Rats when selecting for the position of a CEO.  Therefore, Fire Dragons *do* hold more power in this world because of that selection bias... That makes it a self-fulfilling prophesy.  And it absolutely *does* matter what star you are born under, no matter what material scientists that fail to see *actual* reality, have to say about it.
I mean, I assume Neil knows - like all good material scientists ought to - that a bank note is less valuable than shit (since things grow from shit)... Yet I don't hear him telling the world that money is not 'real'.  Neil himself, is subject to the same power of belief structures as the astrologists he will pooh-pooh.
**"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."** 
Astrology, Jesus, Capitalism, Hollywood: it's all 'real' if people *believe* it is 'real'; just like money and bitcoin are 'real' because we 'believe' them to be so.
If you want to know what the future looks like then, you only need to travel there in your mind like Steve Jobs did and ask yourself what you would like that future to look like.  If the vision you have is something you think would be of benefit to the other 7 billion humans on the planet, then there's a high degree of probability your vision is gonna' come true as soon as it [crosses the chasm]( of belief and gathers the network effect.
Make no mistake: [We are all from the future]( and it looks very beautiful indeed - if we believe it does.

**First we must understand the problems that bought us here**
We must realise that we have been producing a load of junk we don't need just to keep everyone busy, that the specious notion we must each "earn a living" is absolutely at odds with the essential objective truth: we live on a planet of abundance with enough food and resources to satisfy the needs of every individual.  It is only the ill-conceived notion of artificial scarcity that tells us otherwise.  Warehouses this very moment have tons of rice, cocoa beans and essential medical supplies rotting away because somebody has speculated on their prices.  Built in obsolescence borne of the 'lightbulb cartel' era means even TESLA are producing cars that deliberately limit their potential, because of a fixation on money instead of utility.  
We have created a banking system that punishes the poor with interest payments on loans and overdraft limits that perpetually keep them trapped in debt whilst those very interest payments line the pockets of those sitting on vast sums of 'money' who essentially profit from getting money for nothing.  £40k+ a year - more than the salary of a nurse, just for sitting on a £1m inheritance with your feet up as the land you inherited sits outside doing nothing.
I know personally of tons of shipping containers that have been sat at ports around the world, filled with everything from plastic figurines to beanie babies that didn't sell during high street Christmas bonanzas and now do nothing.  We measure country value on GDP growth without asking what it is we are growing and why?  The only thing that keeps growing in the human body is cancer.  We have 'chief' economists admitting the debt in America can never ever be repayed, which is essentially admitting there is no such thing as debt, since the very definition of debt is "monies that will be repaid at a future date." but of course, none of them would admit this in 'public' since it undermines our faith in those 'experts' that have duped us all into believing a material illusion.
Car manufacturers still produce diesel and petrol engines even though we have, for years, been able to upgrade to energy efficient alternatives.  We have a Hydrogen bus that goes around London, and has done for years, which tells us that zero-emission tech is already here.  And yet the economy and a system reliant on middlemen and gatekeepers cannot be allowed to thrive for as long as business models revolve around patents, and shareholder interests in profit.  Profit in a broken measurement tool we call money that was long ago decoupled from 'reality' and is no longer fit for purpose or able to measure real 'wealth'.  How can it when we don't even know how much of it is in the world and where half of all physical cash exists in the shadow economy?
We have created a system that revolves around the 'tyranny of clocks', a work-life balance that has lead to myriad mental disorders where now depression and suicide are bigger killers than wars.  We have, through greed and excess created an obesity epidemic that sees the west throwing a third of their food away whilst a third of the world starve and where 4 billion of the world don't even have access to the global economy.  That system thrives on applying band-aids to the depression and anxiety and actually profits from it (big pharma makes more money the more illnesses it gets to patch, there's no incentive to tackle the underlying root cause).  
Humanity in the west has slept walked into obedience to men and women who have sold us the idea that money and the attainment of trinkets leads to happiness, when we know for a fact, it's at best an artificial high (we are all on the same hedonic treadmill) and that it is only through experiences and travel that we can find true self actualisation.  Most people in the west don't even know where the sun sets, let alone think about going out to stargaze or look at the moon and think deeply about the world.  Most are too busy playing angry birds or watching UFC to think of using that downtime to actually make sense of reality, to read about history or philosophy or get involved in world-changing projects like bitcoin.  
They're happy to worship false idols on a stage telling them how the world works and dream of one day being in the spotlight themselves, failing to recognise that they already have the technology (facebook, hd camera in their pocket, patreon, twitch) to put their art, music and ideas out there for the world to see.  We no longer have to compete for the limited bandwidth of terrestrial broadcast, everyone can now express themselves without seeking middlemen approval.
They're too busy because to think of these things because the 9-5 cubicle they slave away in shields them from the natural beauty of the world... and yet ask most what the actual point of their job is, and the vast majority will shrug and say "I dunno'".  We've taken artists and enslaved them to create cheap advertising to sell us more cheap crap to keep the system going...  Why do I have to buy 20 pencils for £1 when I only want one pencil?  Why do I have to buy one get one free?  Why do we accept that every house on the street has a lawnmower when we only need the utility of *a* lawnmower and most only get used perhaps an hour a month?  Why do we accept Starbucks keep producing plastic straws, knives, spoons that are made of oil and will go to landfill when we could re-use porcelain cups, metal spoons?
Why?  Because we have accepted that companies can exist without a "Why", without thinking about the negative impact they and their supply chains are having, just as long as they're making money for those people at the top putting their feet up.

Plenty of people thanked bitcoiners during Q4 last year.  There were many posts from folks who had attained a degree of social mobility that would never have been possible without bitcoin (student loans being paid off, house and car purchases, kids college fees paid, dreamers finally getting to realise their dreams of travelling the world).
For those newcomers who believe in the technology and feel they missed out on some of that, it's worth remembering (as evidenced by those posts) that good things come to those who wait.  
In the meantime, also remember there is life outside bitcoin.  Switch off the price feeds from time to time...  Might as well actually enjoy the summer whilst doing all that waiting...

The connotation around trainspotters is one of an anorak wearing nerd, sat alone on a bench scribbling down train numbers into a notebook all day...Similar to how 'neckbeards' are portrayed today.
In more recent times the term has since been associated with the movie 'Trainspotting' (and consequently drug use) but this perhaps works well in the context of Silkroad and early bitcoiners being labelled as drugged up libertarian / crazy utopian hippy types.

- You still haven't hidden anything in plain sight you can safely carry around with you in your head (the equivalent of having a brainwallet).

This isn't about professors or even individual students at MIT (who I'm sure are all fine, wonderful human beings).  
This is about a privately owned administration pulling the strings behind a sprawling organisation that is very much in the pocket of government and big business - the absolute antithesis of what bitcoin represents.
MIT (by their own admission) played a big part in the series of events that lead to Aaron's death.  That makes them at least partially culpable.   
And yet there's been **no formal apology**, **no-one has resigned** and, as a final fuck you to Aaron and his family, their own internal investigation lead to them concluding there was “no wrongdoing on MIT’s part” and that they proudly maintained a position of 'neutrality' throughout.
This conclusion came despite the fact MIT’s lawyers gave prosecutors total access to witnesses and evidence, while refusing access to Aaron’s lawyers to the exact same witnesses and evidence.
Hardly neutral.  But the crux is this - why should they be neutral anyway instead of protecting 'one of their own' - especially when the aggrieved party (JSTOR) had no interest in pursuing criminal charges?
I like to believe we can all change, but in light of the above, one must surely acknowledge you have done something wrong in the first place, before there's any chance of actual reform.
In the meantime, forgive me and others for feeling somewhat uncomfortable that the MIT administration have just taken a huge stake in influencing the future of bitcoin and its devs.

Bitcoin is money as information, just like MP3's are music as information.  It's up to the individual to decide how they wish to store and transport that information.
You'd do well to look into the history of hardware wallets and Slush (Marek Palatinus) who founded Trezor because of a security breach.
Also look into Andreas' comments on paper wallets.  He advises to steer well clear and use a hardware wallet instead (he himself owns Trezors).  He went into the pitfalls of paper wallets in quite some depth.
But each to their own, it's your perogative to store your bitcoins however you see fit.

Ironically, this rigid idealogical thinking that Bitcoin has a 'definition' set in stone is exactly the kind of myopic thinking that lead to bitcoin cash and Satoshi's 'vision' being created the moment that original definition had to be adapted to a changing environment. 
It no more has a definition than the internet did.  Both Bitcoin and the internet are just ideas constantly evolving and adapting.  It's for the whole of humanity to figure out what those ideas will become.  Some wayseers may help guide the ship along its journey, but there can be no captains in charge of its destination.

Also worth pointing out deaths that would have occurred due to impurities in MDMA procured from less scrupulous street dealers, and of course, those people taking too much of the stuff (which doesn't even compare to the amount of people who die of alcohol poisoning due to over consumption every single day).
Had MSM not completely overreacted to the death of Leah Betts (who died from drinking *too much* water whilst on ecstasy in the 90s) then calm, rational dialogue and real scientific progress on these issues may not have been held back for nearly three decades.  We can be grateful to David Nutt et al for standing firmly behind science when Gordon Brown's government asked him to retract his comments on ecstasy and cannabis or face expulsion.  He said something akin to "I'm a Scientist; I'm not going to lie to the public about my findings, no matter how uncomfortable that makes the government." 
It must be acknowledged that Silk Road and other clean drug marketplaces have done a lot to reduce both the street violence and impurities that come with these kinds of drugs, so, contrary to the knee-jerk MSM narrative above, it is a fact that bitcoin and cryptos like monero have done a lot to save lives. 
The fact that vendors have to lay down hefty deposits, enter intro escrow and rely on good user feedback ratings ensures drugs remain clean and as advertised in the same way Uber drivers and AirBnb hosts are inventised to provide honest service.
Here's a detailed academic research paper from the university of Swansea that supports this:
[The Rise and Challenge of Dark Net Drug Markets](
*Key Findings*
- For vendors and purchasers who use the sophisticated, user friendly and increasingly 
secure Dark Net sites, hidden markets present **a safer environment for drug transactions 
and they reduce the multiple risks** (coercion, violence, arrest, exposure to other drugs) 
associated with ‘street’ sales.

- Research demonstrates that anonymised user forums and online chat rooms *encourage and 
facilitate information sharing* about drug purchases and drug effects, representing **a novel form of harm reduction** for drug users and an entry point for drug support services.
These studies are further backed up by University of Lausanne criminologist David Decary-Hetu and University of Manchester law professor Judith Aldridge who drew similar conclusions.  They also observed that recreational drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy were far more prevalent in these markets than more harmful drugs.

Blockchain tech has the capacity to level the playing field for creators and consumers and free them from the yoke of middlemen.  Whether Kim's business plan has this in mind or whether the tech will end up just exasperating the 'war on piracy' is another matter entirely.
Question is, why are people investing in stuff before they have done full due diligence and questioned the ethics of what they stand to profit from?  Whilst I assume Max and Simon have been privy to full disclosure, unless Kim opens those plans up to the full crowd of investors we can hazard a guess this is just bandwagon jumping instigated through hype and the promise of profits...  Actions that take us all back to square-one.  
You have something revolutionary Kim?  Do what Satoshi did - let the crowd see it and help you develop the ideas.  Otherwise we're just at the mercy of yet another gatekeeper having guessed at the optimal solution.  And aren't gatekeepers exactly what you're supposed to be 'fighting' against?
TL;DR:Blockchain tech and bitcoin can be used to free humanity or it can be used to create bigger, faster versions of the same shit, and bigger wallets for those whose bottomline is profit margins as opposed to the 'why?' of what they're doing.
The future belongs to those who think very carefully about the wider ramifications of where their investments are going at this nascent stage.  Those who will find themselves standing on the wrong side of this future will come to the cognition they threw money down the same toilet that consumed many of the 'dotcom' boom or bust speculators.

I was there during these protests. It wasn't a pretty sight to see kids throwing molotovs at police, and screaming old ladies tear gassed and struggling to breathe in the ensuing fracas.
Nor was it comforting to see the rise of the golden dawn (nazi) party, that at some point captured 18% of the vote there as a result of all the anger and confusion (which ultimately leads to the same kinds of scapegoat mentality history witnessed in the build up to WWII).
Bitcoin was invented to pave the way toward a **peaceful way out** of this madness, not as a battering ram to torch the old world.

If this is how you feel then it is within your power - and right - as a citizen to stand up, and get out there and demand change.  Indeed, it is from our ancestors doing just that, that we enjoy many of the freedoms we today take for granted.
Rather than whinge, we can get up, make some noise and be the positive change we want to see in others.  And since you're involved in bitcoin, simply spreading awareness to ordinary folk in your local community (outside of the reddit echo chambers) can be part of that "getting up" process.

Just as the transition to storing money inside computers and on plastic cards was slow and gradual, so too will the crypto transformation of financial institutions.
The changeover will likely take a decade (which is actually incredibly fast on the grand cosmic scale).  It will be quiet and peaceful (as the last decade in Bitcoin has been).  
As bitcoin becomes a part of the ordinary everyday mileu, most people won't even notice it happening... just as we didn't notice the exponential smartphone adoption rate until they were everywhere.

Money is just a human convention.  The problems you cite are nearly all related to disparity of wealth (Wealth != Money).  But it's also about people (across all social strata) not taking *individual* responsibility.
And God yes, I've seen my fair share of addicts in this demon haunted world along the many different paths I've walked, but I've seen them at every rung of the ladder...
You only have two options if you are not happy with how your particular version of reality is working out.  You can choose to get up and try make things better, or you can leave and go find a better reality.
Those choices apply to those wealthy addicts feeling trapped in jobs they hate and loveless relationships as much as it does someone in poverty.  


If you're using Reddit then you are already living in more abundant luxury than that enjoyed by kings and queens a century ago.  It's all relative.
As such, you really do have options.  You can choose to educate yourself for free online instead of wasting time on cheap thrills and entertainment; you can choose to help others; you can choose to join a community (online or in real life); you can choose to jump on a plane and go discover the world...
Sadly, most people are content to simply complain and blame others for their strife instead of appreciating the abundance of options we have for finding true meaning in life within our actual sphere of influence.
In short, whilst the 'system' may have failed you (no matter how 'rich' or 'poor' you may be), there is no reason to fail yourself.

That's the thing about money, the more you have, the more you realise it doesn't matter anymore.
Btw, you're talking about insider trading, which happens all the time.
As for CEOs knowing everything about their business, that's hardly ever the case.  As well as a whole bunch of unknowable external factors (such as the outcome of an impending court case or new government legislation) that can catch a company unawares, any sizeable corporation with many departments and multitudinous operations cannot ever be fully understood by any one human (or even the board of directors).

Author assumes bitcoiners exist in a bubble inside 'Murricah.  There is no 'libertarian' movement in the UK for instance, which is host to the largest bitcoin meetup group in the world, and myriad tech companies who have set up base there to escape cumbersome federal/state laws that make US innovation impractical at best.  
Never have I seen such a diverse cross-section of people from every social strata/political ideology out there all able to put preconceived differences aside and focus on real, practical changes that this technology enables.  
Once the 'satoshi' drops, you realise the very real power of bitcoin is that it enables us to transcend old political and legal systems that were long ago infiltrated by the organised criminal class who view humanity from the myopic lens of the 'shock and awe' doctrine.  In this scenario the old partisan demagogues (and their followers and antiquated ideas) are rendered largely irrelevant to this new process of permissionless collaboration and innovation.

Take away the word 'bank' from this and what is it?  An education centre teaching people how all this works and providing a service sorely needed to help safely onboard the less tech savvy.
Incidentally, we weren't 'supposed' to have exchanges either but hey ho, the beauty of open source technology is people are free to adopt it as they see fit.  And you, as a user, are free to vote with your pocketbook on ideas you think have merit.
If there is a point to bitcoin, it's to live and let live; there can be no glorius dictators telling us what to do with the technology or what services should or should not exist.  That's for the crowd to ultimately decide.

A long time ago, this entire theatre moved away from missiles and bombs to information dissemination being a way more potent force.  It's now nigh on impossible for the proletariat (or leaders representing them) to discern fact from fiction in that information war, such is the state of hypernormalisation we now find ourselves ensnared by.
It seems this entire thing has been a play by all 'sides' operating with fuzzy information, desperate to engineer a stalemate without anyone losing face (which would require admitting noone really has a clear picture of what is happening).
It many ways, it feels like the end of Sid Meier's Civilization where the only sane move to make is to plough all capital and resources previously set aside for fighting wars into science.  There are isolated skirmishes here and there on the map... but most nations are firmly engaged in demilitarisation, as the race to get to the stars heats up...
The only question that remains is, who will get to alpha centurai first?  With luck, bitcoiners representing the whole of humanity ;)
If we wish to retain some semblance of sanity, we can but stick to objective reality, and show citizens the exit ramps as we keep on moving the technology forward.

There *are* good people over in r/btc doing the right things for the right reasons who *do* deeply care about the technology.  And there are plenty get-rich-quick folk over here in r/bitcoin that don't give a damn and relish all the schadenfreude.

The end goal is total automation of nearly all jobs that people don't want to be doing (we didn't end slavery, we just dispersed it across all 'races').

Bucky Fuller touches upon all this in ['operating manual for a spaceship Earth']( also.  And there's a wonderful Alan Watts talk called ['the hypocrisy around money']( that sums all this up beautifully. 
Moon for everyone has to be *actual* moon and a new human narrative that sees the world as one planet, and as one species capable of becoming an interplanetary Type I civilisation.  We get there through collaboration and using all this tech to build a world computer monitoring all resources, which ultimately paves the way toward the transition to a resource based economy.  
A world without the need for money, where we are all free to roam is really hard for most people to grok until you begin to see [the bigger picture]( all this technology unfolds into. 
Truth is, we live in a world of abundance and we already have everything we could possibly need to make all that happen.

That's like saying "Tim Berners-Lee couldn't have invented the internet because it he had patented it he world have been 'worth' more than Bill Gates".  Of course, like Satoshi, Tim didn't patent the internet (even though he knew it would have made him the richest human on earth over night) because he knew it would have lead to a diaspora of corporate internets where no one person had universal access to the truth.
So... since we're fine with psychopaths and dictators we've never met becoming billionaires and wielding unchecked power over governments, we ought be fine with a Satoshi being a trillionaire since he/she/they have a long, auditable history of being someone who cares very deeply about the world and the problems that come with power (hence Satoshi insisted on group concensus).
Further, since bitcoin is just code, there is nothing (at least technically) to suggest the Satoshi coins couldn't be moved to a decentralised global aid fund overseen and governed by the group.
Similar to how dormant bank accounts in the UK have recently had their funds diverted to homeless charities.
Whether there are ethical considerations for setting such a precedent is another matter.
Finally, there exists the very real possibility that Satoshi (and bitcoin) is a product of governments (just as TOR is) and the keys are already in the hands of organisations like the EFF/UN.

You might be right, I'm not a solicitor or a judge... It's far from clear whether someone thinking they're buying bitcoin and ending up with BCH would have a case under misrepresentation.  Advice in here has always been 'buyer beware, know what you're getting into'.  
That's all well and good, but what about the less tech savvy getting duped by bitcoin.com who innocently thought BCH labelled as Bitcoin was *actual* bitcoin? 
The way this world currently works, wouldn't suprise me if someone tried testing that in court before too long.  Would bitcoin.com then be culpable for all those missold bitcoins?  Would a class action follow?  Who knows.
As Jihan Wu pointed out a long time ago, BCH should be confident enough in their own creation to be able to survive on the bitcoin cash label without using underhand tactics that blur the distinction between the two codebases (which they know is confusing users and doing harm).  Long-term it's BCH they're actually harming most because of all that future uncertainty they're creating (legal and otherwise).
And who would want to needlessly add the technical support burden that would be dealing with folks who we see everyday ending up with BCH instead of BTC?
Everything in the end is about belief and confidence in the integrity of the teams involved.  Less so the state of the technology at this still very early stage.  So all of this - even market psychology - ultimately comes back to trust.
Personally, I'd much prefer the ecosystem figure it out and actors within just 'do the morally right thing'. 
That trust in each other to follow 'the golden rule', back when there was only one bitcoin and we were all heavily outnumbered, is what got us this far afterall.

Europe is a big place.  You are describing the idyllic Mediterranean lifestyle, not the kind of scenes we witness in large European cities and rundown suburban neighborhoods where people often turn to binge drinking because there is little else to do.  Alcohol related illnesses, teenage pregnancy, gambling addiction and violent crime all go hand-in-hand with alcohol consumption and the poverty it engenders.


No-one is calling for any of these things to be banned.  We only need look to alcohol prohibition in 1920s America (or the current 'war' on drugs) to see just what a disaster that would be. 
What we do need though, is for companies and governments to start taking their *duty of care* more seriously on this issue, especially when using distraction techniques and blaming societal ills on other drugs, when the science tells us alcohol is *the* biggest problem.  
Of course when presenting these hard truths, it's very difficult to get over the ensuing cognitive dissonance when our own government offices are being run, in some instances, by high functioning alcoholics :p.  
Quite why we think it's acceptable for politicians intoxicated on a regular basis to be able to inform public opinion and make sensitive policy decisions, is beyond me.  Alcohol is a crappy drug that massively degrades cognitive performance, and we ought to be able to hold leaders regularly under its influence to account.  If we wouldn't trust  drunk people to steer our car safely, we shouldn't trust them to steer our countries either.
Indeed, I have a number of academic friends who have been in and out of government for some two decades now, backed up by irrefutable science on these issues and, whilst they have made (very) slow progress, oftentimes they described the process akin to banging their heads against a brick wall.  When those with truth and logic on their side are heavily outnumbered, how does one pull off a successful intervention in a room full of addicts in denial?  
Time, unflappable patience, and a striving to build new permissionless models that transcend these medieval ways of doing things is the only way of pulling *everyone* forward in the end.
One of the other issues is a western narrative that portrays alcohol as a positive lifestyle choice.  It wasn't that long ago men and women were used in advertising to sell that other 'legal' drug we call nicotine through promotions pushed by the cigarette industry... A narrative played out where scantily clad women and rebellious guys would portray smoking as the sexy new cool thing to do.  
The meme successfully sewn, smoking spread through populaces like a virus.  
Although smoking advertising restrictions only came into full effect in the West over the last few decades, we take it as self evident today that harmful products like cigarettes should not be marketed in such a manner.  And yet we continue to tolerate advertisers portraying alcohol as something that is hip and trendy, belying the scientific truth: alcohol is every bit as dangerous, addictive and harmful to individuals and societies, as passé drugs like cigarettes.
Ultimately, this is first and foremost about education and trusting individuals to make well informed decisions about what they choose to put in their bodies.  Be that the mind altering substance we call alcohol, or any other.  
Any progress made along that educational arc, will of course be hampered by an advertising industry (and lobbyists) that are able to weave false narratives carried by the profit motive.  Again, it doesn't help when our leaders being informed by those lobbyists are themselves high functioning alcoholics (or, in other words, drug addicts).
Fortunately, younger generations are far less impressionable when it comes to all this, and have been figuring out how to do their own research online and draw their own (well informed) conclusions.  And when it's time for these tech savvy generations to start taking the steering wheel, it's unlikely they will suffer from the same cognitive impairments of those 'gin-addled' generations that came before.
Hence why David Nut and other scientists who have dedicated their lives to these issues  envisage the vast majority of westerners *electing* to cease drinking alcohol of their own free will, within a generation.
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:14:36
To be clear: here's [the full breakdown of Prof. David Nutt's results](


Unless we are qualified scientists with specialist knowledge in this domain (and are able to contribute to peer review) we don't need to *agree* with the findings.  It's science based on hard evidence that has taken years of painstaking research, not a wooly opinion piece in a tabloid newspaper.


It is precisely *because* of alcohols widespread prevalence as a 'socially acceptable' drug, that has lead to it causing such devastating harm, both to individuals and society at large. 
Of course, this is hardly the first time in history the vast majority of the populace have become inured to the damage being cause by the inebriated elephants in their own backrooms.  See [Hogarth's Beer Street and Gin Lane]( 
Luckily, many are waking up to all this; alcohol consumption in younger generations is at all time lows.  
Incidentally, David went on to set up a non-profit tasked with solving these problems and is currently working on a project called [Alcosynth]( that replicates the (positive) effects of alcohol without any of the harmful side-effects.  It is likely that should an initiative like this prove effective, then western societies will elect to give up alcohol within a generation (10-20 years).  Same with the meat industry when projects like the 'Google Burger' and BeyondMeat are able to produce healthier alternatives via a slaughter-free laboratory environment.  They can already do this, it's only a matter of time before lab grown meat comes to mass market.

Thanks for your thoughts.
It kinda' astounds me how people who got into bitcoin (which has thoroughly shaken up a whole bunch of old world status quo's we thought were never going to change) will then go on to cite entities like Bitmain as if they are going to be here forever.  Clearly, with companies like Halong and Samsung entering the mining space, the days of any one entity being able to play fast and loose with their mining power are numbered.  
We mustn't forget either, that backup plans (such as an emergency PoW change) would brick their entire enterprise.  


That's the thing, *no-one is in charge* of bitcoin's development.
When we talk about Bitcoin's greatest strength when it comes to decentralisation... It is really in the open, transparent and fully decentralised processes that have been put into place *on the coding side*, and the strict peer-review from 1,000's of computer scientists and engineers from MIT to UCL that ensures no single line of code can be added without being rigorously scrutinised...  These are people that can come and go as they see fit, who do not need to be paid by a corporation where they feel cooped up in an office environment with a hierarchical management structure and a 'boss' breathing down their neck.
It is a system where no one person has any more 'power' than any other.  It is this resilience to power corrupting that remains it's greatest USP.
As for corruption being a part of life.  That really depends on who you have around you in your life and the kinds of morals they were bought up to follow.  Some believe in the Golden Rule, or 'treat others as you wish to be treated yourself'; some keep our promises; some do not believe business has to be ruthless.  In fact, that entire corporate philosophy of "don't be evil" expresses the idea that we can make money and do good things in the world without exploiting others.  Adam Back and Austin Hill took it a step further and asked could we build a network that "can't be evil"?
So, again, just because an entire generation of people fell for the lie of "greed is good" does not mean the world will always remain that way.  Indeed, many of the younger generations called bullshit on that a long time ago when they saw the cliff edge it leads to...


These are fair points.  Although I would remind people that ex Google Security Engineer Mike Hearn (who famously rage quit BTC) was the 2nd person to start coding on bitcoin in his 20% time at Google and was running an internal email group of 400 googlers whilst regularly reporting back to Larry.  Jack Dorsey (CEO of Twitter / Squarepay) echoed these sentiments just recently.
Paul Graham (Y-Combinator) has come out in support of bitcoin and said he has no interest in alts like ethereum via his twitter.  Chamath Palihapitiya (ex-Facebook executive) has been vocal about his love of bitcoin and stressed that it would take years to scale and 'become a payment instrument'.  
AirBnB (which came from Y-Combinator) hired the Changetip team some three or so years ago.  Developers on Google's unified web payment gateway dropped BTC as an example currency into the docs.  Couple all of that with the pro-bitcoin statements coming from the greatest computer scientists who been thinking and dreaming about things happening in this space for a couple of decades (Szabo et al), and I think there's enough dots there that can be joined to figure out where this is all likely to go.
Not to mention all the real world bitcoin establishments and infrastructure that are now taking shape and folding into meatspace at a near exponential rate... the bitcoin meme has now been firmly sewn into the public consciousness in everything from ATM's and shops accepting bitcoin, to episodes of the Simpsons and Family guy to monuments in Slovenia, pop songs and rap artists, Hollywood movies, and modern art... 
Cliched as it may sound, a lot of people in this world really do love bitcoin.  
No amount of slick marketing campaigns or cleverly repackaged 'bigger, faster, stronger' altcoin coding adjustments can buy any of that love.  
As Andreas Antonopoulos (another bitcoin aficionado) once said "It's very important to not mistake smooth sailing for good sailors".  
Which means for all it's chaotic quirks and imperfections, that love and the huge diversity of the ecosystem alone means Bitcoin remains in good stead to weather whatever storm is thrown at it.

Of course in places like Africa, they skipped landlines altogether and went straight to mobile phones.  Similarly, they skipped banks by adopting phone credits as money (MPESA).
The purpose of bitcoin is not to replace fiat in one fell swoop, it's to provide a support mechanism and new ways of doing things that can fix problems in an old world that had tied itself up in red tape.
This is not a race, it's a renaissance... and there can be no outright victory.  For this to work, it needs to work for *everyone*.

Yep which is beautiful and necessary...
There's a big difference between a computer *programmer* and a computer *scientist*.  Were people not able to fork, all those who don't understand the science and complex socio-economic problems behind all this would saturate the development channels with noise and grind peer review to a standstill.
The ecosystems of speculators and get rich quick kids they spawn also serve to shield the grassroots community and public outreach channels from the same noise.  
In addition, people in those disparate communities are still learning about the technology, and their skills, experience and ideas will be absolutely needed further down the road when layer 2/3 tech starts rolling out.
In that respect, forks are actually (at least in the interim) bitcoin's best *defence* vector ;)

Not really.
Perhaps in 2012/13 you'd have a point.  Boy did everyone feel outnumbered at things like money 20/20 conferences back then.  Although even back then everyone in this space (and sub) were keen we all simply stick to facts, and keep incendiary imagery like the one above to a minimum.
Today, I'm glad to say that as a result of all that care, this space (and the people in both bitcoin and fintech) have matured... and found much common ground to work with.
As such, the image in your post is at best highly out of date, and at worst the 'new world' equivalent of some 'old world' op-ed hit piece ignorantly lambasting bitcoin: both see the world as polarised; both fail to see the bridges we've all worked so hard to build in old world and new to ensure this technology gets into the hands of as many good, ordinary citizens as possible; both miss what's *actually* going on and fail to see the bigger (peaceful) picture unfolding. 
Fortunately those old world hit pieces are much fewer in number nowadays, as are those bitcoiners and old world financiers who naively relished the idea of this being an "us vs. them" fight.

In order to figure it all out you need only ask your future self a few questions and try to answer them as objectively as possible.
If you were to sell your house in 5 years time, or recommend your loved ones invest some of their hard earned savings, or if you were a government looking to move their land registry over to a public ledger... Here's the things you (and billions of other people) are going to be considering:
- Which blockchain has the widest distribution of programmers with the longest track record?
- Which blockchain is already known by most westerners?
- Which blockchain has the best ideas and brains for coping with evolving use cases (such as scaling solutions)?
- Which blockchain has established a set of clear, transparent procedures for peer review and has proven most resilient to hostile takeovers?
- Which is the only blockchain supported by the very inventors behind the key technologies that were required for all of this to happen? 
All of which amounts to the same question you and those billions of other ordinary citizens will ask when all this becomes as pedestrian as using a debit card...
- Which blockchain are you going to trust with the people and things in your life you truly value?
It's really that simple. Strip away all the price discussions and hubris, and if we are to answer our Grandmas truthfully when they enquire "what's the safest blockchain store of value for my pension?" there can be only one truly honest, rational answer.
Over time, that will become self evident to everyone in this space because it will be the users themselves that decide the future.

There was a time when people in here were lampooned for predicting $100, then $1,000 then $10,000.  
In that light, $10-100k will be a lot easier than all those previous milestones. Then $1m starts looking less crazy.  
A lot of these predictions start becoming a self fulfilling prophecy, since it's all built on belief.
As long as the tech keeps evolving at the pace it is, seems to me those predictions look pretty reasonable.  Time will tell.

I remember 5,000.  Things were a lot simpler then, more trust between participants and a tight focus on the things we could do with the technology and the problems it was created to solve.  
Back in the day, outside of here and bitcointalk noone knew what the heck bitcoin was, and most people in 'real life' would think you'd taken crazy pills whenever bringing it up.  It was an arduous and often thankless task trying to spread the idea of bitcoin to ordinary people. 
To witness that change so rapidly has been a delight.  I remember seeing people from this community talking about Bitcoin on MSM for the first time and it felt like a real "OMG! It's happening!" moment.
But we can dispense with the vintage rose-tinted goggles... the sub has never been perfect; it's a reflection of humanity - with each new adoption wave comes a new group of naysayers and over exuberant freshers.  Over time, most find the beauty in the science of all this and settle down around the same time the price does.  Then they go on to teach the next wave of cohorts what they've learnt from others, just as I did when I was new to all this.  The real gift in this sub, is knowledge... In many ways r/bitcoin resembles a school everyone is invited to.
How beautiful today to see all the silly memes and happy bitcoiners taking selfies out in the open infront of bitcoin signs appearing in real life... No longer does saying the B word in public result in blank stares.  No longer do we have to sit in the shadows.

Good for you, and that's your perogative, and free choice.
Just as it's our grandparents free choice to entrust the bitcoin sale of the house they've worked for all their life to a group of people that can ensure those proceeds will be kept safe and secure, and have consumer assurances in place that hold them to account should they fail to live up to their obligations.
Heck, even bitcoin whales like the Winklevi store their keys in bank safety deposit boxes.
That's their business, their bitcoin, and their choice to do that and you have absolutely no right to tell them otherwise.
Of course, the big difference between storing bitcoin keys with a bank over storing fiat, is that the bank cannot gamble with your bitcoin savings nor rig the ecosystem to work in their favour.

Of course the issue is knowing what tools are the fix and what actually constitutes being rich. 
One can live in a penthouse surrounded by the most abundant luxuries... staring out at a busker below getting by day to day.  The busker travels the world carefree singing her way through the day... her home in a rucksack.
To the rich man in the penthouse he looks down on her as if she is nothing more than a bum... yet she has seen more sunsets, more shooting stars, has created more beauty and art in the world and, with that, made more people laugh and smile with joy and, as a result, made many thousands more true friends along this beautiful dance we call life...
Who is rich then?  The wealthy man surrounded by the invisible prison walls of his penthouse suite stressing about illusory numbers in a ledger, or the busker whose blanket is the milky way above?  
History tells us the answer is the latter.  Indeed, many of our ancestors that contributed most to humanity did so with little more than their wits and the sheer unbridled joy of *actually* living.

Good points.  However, whilst it is difficult to come up with examples (Wikipedia, bittorrent perhaps?), it's important to remember that never before has any open source project had $3billion of what is essentially 'investment' ploughed into it from the crowd.  
I mention below the $15million Ethereum raised from bitcoiners; it would not be difficult to get a neutral platform together that raised similar amounts for core dev.  


Keywords here being *influence* and *control* neither of which should be applied to bitcoin development.  If MIT wanted to contribute to a neutral funding pool then fine, but in no way should core dev find themselves beholden to one entity and all the internal politics and bureaucracy that comes with it.

In the meantime those doing the digging are like those old website tinkerers... They're learning some very important skills that can later be transmuted to Layer 2/3 when the real construction begins.

Ha.  Appreciate the black mirror reference :)
What you're essentially discussing is the tradgedy of the commons.
This is why ethereum and the alt coin ecosystem was created, in order to keep busy those that don't understand the responsibility and duty of care that comes with this technology.  Few 'specialists' truly understand the complex socio-economic problems bitcoin was invented to solve, including some of those cypherpunks that latched onto it in the early days who have since moved onto other alts.  As such, bitcoin is far more dependent upon generalists who have a broad understanding of everything it touches, and the perils therein. 
Underneath everything happening in bitcoin is a group of highly motivated individuals who have been involved in disruptive technology for many decades, who were deeply concerned about the state of the world before they realised bitcoin was *the* solution.  They also realised of course that, just as with the internet, releasing this upon the world would create sustained periods of chaos as the ecosystem (and world at large) reconfigured itself to cope with the new adjacent possible.
Whilst the 'blockchain' ecosystem appears chaotic to the causal observer, the networks of collaboration within bitcoin itself have only grown stronger and more diverse as time has gone by, further strengthened by work going on in the various tech 'sandboxes' that are alts like ethereum.
As such, the myriad 'backup plans for backup plans for backup plans' many in this space are working on 24/7 will ensure bitcoin keeps evolving wayyyy ahead of any who seek to subvert it.  In such a scenario, bitcoin can no more be controlled by 'facists' than the technology of RFID chips (or the internet for that matter) could be.  
All this is contingent upon the trust and belief we have in each other to do good with all this.  That belief is way more important than the technology itself (which is just a tool). 
Ultimately, it's up to all of us to decide where we want the technology (and the wayseers behind it) to take us.

Given all the hacker beaches of banking IT infrastructure exactly how much faith would people put in a private blockchain remaining secure given the massive bounty a successful hack would unleash?
Open, distributed and adaptive solutions will airways prevail over a system presided over by a small coterie of fallible humans, especially when the only incentive for the nerds tasked with securing the network is a paltry wage packet. 
They will spend billions jumping through hoops to devise a system of checks and counter checks to establish antiquated security precautions and cripple their own ability to adapt to the inevitable unstoppable march of Bitcoin that is secure by default.

You make some very good points.  
I think a lot of that 'running before we can walk' comes from an older generation that were the first tinkerers in cyberspace having to work alongside a younger generation that can't remember a world before the fully formed internet those tinkerers helped build...
Whilst I understand the excitement of those in this space enjoying their first flush of success on the internet... there are many experienced techies behind the scenes who are approaching all this with considerably more caution... many see history rhyming, and are loath to repeat the same mistakes.
Since you bring netscape up... It's worth noting that Daniel Buchner (head of Microsoft Decentralised Identity) was, ironically, working at Mozilla in the middle of the 'browser wars' that culminated in the famous Microsoft antitrust cases (their intention was to use windows to "cut off Netscape's air supply").  Bill and co. just saw the internet as a new business vertical to be exploited, and didn't care much for the "information wants to be free" ethos that lead to Tim Berners-Lee giving it to the world without a patent.
I bring up Daniel only because he has been rather vocal in expressing his opposition to alts like BCH and has firmly stated that the only blockchain of interest to him at Microsoft is the one that remains most decentralised and resistant to hostile takeover (in other words, bitcoin).  His history at Mozilla during those browser wars gives him invaluable insight and experience into all this and we ought pay attention to some of the wisdom he gleaned during those years. 
Talking of experience, we forget that all the web giants who have caused so much positive disruption these past few decades (from Google to Ebay and AirBnB) have been virtually silent about all this...  Could it be they're all way ahead of the "lambo pack" and have been diligently working alongside the 1000+ other coders who have been tinkering with [Sidechain Elements Alpha]( and other Layer 2/3 initiatives for the last 3 years? ;)

Rather than getting caught up in the "will they, won't they deliver a bigger, faster, stronger mining rig?"... It's important to take the longer view here and recognise how the mining space is evolving. 
Consumer-level chips in everything from toasters and washing machines to your smartphone and laptop will no doubt be commonplace, and lead to total decentralisation of the mining space.
AMD, Samsung, Nvidia, Nokia and Intel are all making interesting noises about this if you follow things closely enough.
GMO Internet Group have been working on 7nm chips, as per their [announcement here](  


How does this play out as the cost of these chips come down and become available to consumers en-masse?

"I get in enough trouble taking a position on things I do know stuff about, so why would I take a long or short position on something **I don't know anything about?**" — Warren
So, straight from the horses mouth... you have a guy admitting **he doesn't know anything about cryptocurrencies**...  So how on Earth could he then go on to confidently predict the future of a nascent technology he's just said he knows nothing about?
The mind boggles.  This whole thing might as well be a skit from the Onion.
Bottom-line: We don't need people with zero domain knowledge in this field of science telling us what to think and feel about all this.
Do your own research by listening to those who *do* know the technology and take note that even they will be humble enough to say there can be no certainties in where all this is going...

History tells us to be very wary of economic 'experts' who believe they have a greater grasp on predicting the future of a given technology than those *actual* experts (i.e. scientists) who actually understand how the technology is evolving:


Krugman's error was not recognising that the internet was merely the backbone (or, protocol) for the emergence of *multiple* parallel networks of communication and idea sharing platforms that would be built on top of this protocol.  Therefore, Metcalfe's Law does not apply, since we are not talking about the kind of linear scaling that comes with adoption of a single product or service (such as a fax machine).  
Similarly with bitcoin...  The technology is not evolving in a vacuum; beyond obvious metrics such as wallet signups / volume / search trends, we cannot clearly see where all this goes once sidechains and the multiple trust networks being built atop the bitcoin blockchain begin to evolve in parallel and solve real world problems for ordinary people, many of us have not yet even envisaged.  
TL;DR: Time and user adoption of real world services built on top of the protocol will tell where all this goes... (not 'experts' in matters of economics attempting to divine the future).

Yeah I remember seeing him tearing up when talking about Iraq.  Does he really think the original group that created all this doesn't see the same things?  Has he ever read into Adam Back's "Can't be Evil" network philosophy?  Does he think everyone (after 9 chaotic years of giving everything they have to this technology) got involved for 'the Benjamins'?
Can he not see that it is the exact same drive for profits powering much of the BCH / nChain 'business as usual' ethic that lead to the mess we're in today (and required bitcoin in the first place)?  
It's worth remembering the worst evil in this world is often committed by those with the best of intentions.  Roger ought to take a step back from the technology for a moment and consider whether bitcoin has already been doing a sterling job of saving lives (from Arab Spring to Venezuela) due to its ability to shield assets from out-of-control inflation and capital controls.  Indeed, one might argue it's been doing that way before Roger and big business got involved.
The real bottlenecks we are facing are being created by ideologically driven and selfish business interests buoyed by hierarchical decision making, requiring brute forcing a round peg into a square hole, detracting from the *actual* science of all this.
Would we let those VC's that helped put the funding together for the Large Hadron Collider tell us how the engineers ought to smash atoms together?  Or should we leave that to the actual physicists who have been theorising about and working with the science of particle acceleration for the last 20+ years?

If you read up, you will note I was answering the following question:


There is no doubt that many of the ICO/alt projects (at least at the very beginning) have been created by well meaning, honest individuals and teams that genuinely want to see their creation make the world a better place.  
In my view, they are all trying to run before the architects behind the *actual* breakthrough technology have figured out how best to support us walking...
Two of those architects would be Nick Szabo and Adam Back without whom, Satoshi's creation wouldn't have been possible.  They are both actively working on all this today, firmly in the camp of Bitcoin.  If we are to leave the knee-jerk echo chambers and get fully behind the science of all this, doesn't that tell us all we need to know?  Or do we not care about the views expressed by computer scientists, engineers and vocal bitcoin developers like Peter Todd, Jameson Lopp and Jimmy Song that have been here virtually since day one and have all worked so very hard these last 9 years to help nurture Bitcoin from obscurity into the worldwide phenomenon it is today?

There was a really great online initiative in the UK started a few elections ago called [voteforpolicies]( which stripped away party 'ownership' of ideas and simply asked the proletariat which policies they agreed with.  
It would then show a breakdown of the *actual* parties people would support when you remove personality and tribalism.
Millions of people took part and, as expected, most found they didn't 'belong' to any one tribe.  They also tended to vote in favour of more compassionate policies.
With the move from that old paperbelt world to digital it's clear something like this married up with bitcoin / blockstack / rootstock may well be the solution for better harnessing the wisdom of well informed crowds to help guide both macro and micro policy formation.

Even today's bitcoin 'maximalists' were at one point skeptical.  So props to anyone who is able to say "I was wrong about this."
Plenty of people in well paid jobs end up asking themselves "is what I'm doing making the world a better place?" 
I've witnessed people in finance quit and take massive pay cuts to work in things like green energy.  The guy who started Khan Academy quit as a hedge fund manager because he felt there were more important things in the world than money.
For all bitcoin's chaos, there is a real palpable sense at meetups that this is a technology that is really capable of transforming the world for the better.  
As such, it attracts people from all walks of life (who were initially skeptics) that fall in love with the idea.

It's interesting seeing the barrier to entry here being publishers unwilling to sign up.  We're where the internet was at the beginning...  And, just as it was unusual back in the early 90's for major organisations such as CBS to have a website (or even email), it only took a few major 'players' to get onboard before a the tsunami broke and the chasm was crossed.  
Assuming core continue their slow and considered approach to development of the protocol, I imagine every organisation a few years from now will likely have a bitcoin address associated with their DNS record and we'll see all sorts of blockchain based incentives enabling things on both cable TV and traditional publisher sites that are currently out of reach.  
Ad-free browsing being one such option.

Agree and disagree :)
People have gotten all excited about the latest decentralisation buzz without asking "Why do we need it?".  Which is to be expected.  There were lots of silly ideas for www too before the landscape started making more sense to people.
It's a much bigger system being built here that we will see emerging to solve *real* problem, much as we saw www evolve.  Machine-payable-web, micropayments, IoT are going to completely change the way we measure and transport value, and this latest era of false idol and expert worship we have been going through will fade into obscurity as individuals are empowered by the crowd through micropayments, online streaming and social media...  Advertising will be completely upended as will journalism (who will also be paid by the crowd).  There are massive ramifications for voting and liquid democracy, medicine, global citizenship and passport systems and trust based networks.
Absolute transparency in corporate and governance supply chains will mean the kinds of dodgy shell companies and nefarious business practices that lead to stuff like the Panama Leaks will be precluded from participation in a rapidly emerging global network that "Can't Be Evil."
Global crowdfunding drives, tradenets and the rising 4 billion who will gain access to the economy for the first time via things like the Blockstream satellite will further change the game as things like economic migration, war, poverty all suffer almost exponential rates of reduction thanks to the global crowd themselves having a far greater say over where their economic energy is used.  This filters down to micro and macro scale budgets for local towns and villages as much as it does global initiatives. 
The growth of science and technology that comes off the back of this 'wisdom of well-informed, trusted crowds' means science and humanity budgets currently capped to a tiny percentage of GDP will now be basically unfettered.  With more resources and economic energy freed up into being spent on civilian space travel, green energy, vertical and meat-free farming, AI, robotics, medical advances, VR, 3D printing, the sharing economy - all propel us towards a revolution that eclipses the seismic changes we witnessed during the Industrial Revolution.
Focus then goes on what to do with all the empty land (given such a huge percentage is currently desert which can be regenerated and cattle farms which are likely going to be ended/automated).  And just what inner-worlds via VR we want to create, and of course, there will be those keen to further explore outer-space.  This gives humanity a new narrative and a new set of global objectives to strive for beyond merely survival (which has been assured).
Harnessed correctly with a new focus for businesses to think beyond the profit incentive, and we end up with nothing short of a resource based economy and a humanity living in a world of true abundance.  
Whilst that may all sound crazy, it's nothing compared to things people like Ray Kurzweil have been predicting, and it's worth remembering how far we've come in just 10 years - a time when smartphone's weren't even a thing.  
The conflation of all the above, leads to the obvious reality that we are on the cusp of a new renaissance the likes of which humanity has never seen before.

Jamie's statement suggesting Bitcoin wasn't legalised in Japan, is false.
See: [Japan is set to begin recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting tomorrow](  [Vietnam]( and myriad other governments have also made moves to recognise BTC as a formal payment method.
As for Jamies other comments:
The wonderful Nick Colas from Convergex Group tackled pretty much every point Jamie raised wayyy back in 2013 on Bloomberg.
[Video Link - On Bitcoin's Legitimacy](
*"If you are a U.S. buyer of bitcoin your institution is regulated by U.S. law, so there is not total anonymity...80% of US Dollar bills go outside the U.S. and how many times do you see news of a drug bust where there are stacks and stacks of hundred dollar bills?  The fact that a currency is used for illicit activity doesn't make it immoral or illegitimate... " — Nick Colas*
As for Jamie's knee-jerk (borderline xenophobic) comments on bitcoin being used in places like Venezuela, here's an explanation from Chamath Palihapitiya in 2013 who talks about bitcoin being used in this context as a proactive way to *solve* problems ordinary people are facing in those countries.
[Video Link - Bitcoin [is] a Huge, Huge, Huge Deal!](
*"I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fun, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. Because what you're talking about right now is, for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right? The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government. It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina. Everywhere you have currency pressure. Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. And then, after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism." 
— Chamath Palihapitiya*
The payment mechanism part Chamath alluded to is just about to happen thanks to Layer 2 technology augmenting the base bitcoin blockchain protocol (as [explained here]( by Andreas).

This.  I really don't see the massive rush with the bigger, faster, stronger crowd.  Truth is, if this war of capitalists vs. scientists hadn't setback things like segwit adoption by 3 years we'd likely already have off-chain scaling solutions in place without risking 'Paypal 2'esque quick fix solutions and the centralisation that comes with them.
If the price we pay for consensus driven development is a slower (but incredibly stable and reliable horse) then so be it.

Except you're forgetting there's already 1000's of sites that have significant following without needing Google (reddit is one of them).  There would be a robots.txt that just allows google to see index page, rest is payable.  A decentralised search engine competing with google may be free or at a reduced rate; yahoo, msn may be denied access or charged a premium etc. – will be completely up to the publisher who she decides to go with.
You effectively start a bid war then with each search engine.  Google would see it as a point of pride to list these sites over x,y,z search engines.  In addition, browser plugins could be developed that simultaneously search 'the payable web' (think decentralised search engine) when you do a google search, pulling in results on top of your browser, so sites don't get penalised for going 'paysearch dark'.
Ultimately, the 'selling a product' model is completely flipped if you're already a heavyweight site (such as reddit, the guardian, wired etc. that get the majority of traffic from direct hits).  The knock-on effect is less (zero even) reliance on banner advertising on the site itself, since google and users themselves are funding the content, and these sites gain precedence due to a more pleasurable browsing experience.

That makes sense.  
No old skool tech businesses could understand how the internet could work with no patents... And a whole bunch of those companies rather than embracing the internet, tried instead to compete with different protocol concepts... before they finally grokked why the more open protocol would eventually prevail and shifted focus to building stuff on it, rather than trying to compete.
A whole lot of time was wasted, but a whole lot of important stuff was learnt along the way by all 'sides'.  That's literally what's just happened in the 'blockchain' space.  
What's more, all those trying to compete with bitcoin via esoteric blockchain concepts were told all this was going to happen (5 years ago) by those very greybeards that were all here the first time around...  And, funnily enough, those greybeards knew that - just like the first time around - they would again be pooh-poohed for not understanding 'business'; just as Bill Gates laughed at Larry and Sergey for not understanding business (Bill said he'd give Google 'a year' before they went under).

Google can compensate for this by rolling out bitcoin powered adsense ads to publishers of course and then it becomes a self-propagating symbiotic relationship between publisher and crawler.  Users could further put money into the system by opting out of ads (for a premium) rolled out network wide and/or rewarding/tipping publishers and individual authors directly for quality content.
Middlemen like Wall Street Journal eventually become redundant as reporters are no longer relying on an old world publisher to get them an audience, since they can just go solo (think something like the Huffington Post's open authorship model).  The net result is a web governed by quality content instead of the dog-eat-dog competition we currently see leading to poorly researched articles and knee-jerk headlines in the pursuit to compete in echo chamber of duplicated content, in order to gain as many eyeballs as possible.
It will be a return to real investigative journalism as writers are finally freed from the yoke of middlemen and advertisers currently determining article coverage.  Think worldwide league tables of best articles / journalists based on quality (adjudged by the amount of funds rewarded to each by the crowd).

This.  The email exchange is essentially a discussion on PR/Fundraising tactics, NOT the merits of bitcoin.  It's also a one-sided conversation: we have no idea what discussions these initial exploratory emails lead to.
In addition, the email is a year and a half old, a lot has changed since then.  Her [most recent comments on Blockchain]( related tech (June 28th 2016) speak of removing regulation to allow innovators in the space to compete against incumbents.

Ironically, had Wikileaks not blown Bitcoin out into the open so soon (meaning organisations like EFF had to drop early support) then we probably wouldn't even need coinbase (or any exchanges for that matter) since everything would be running through the one decentralised client.  Sadly, that didn't happen because the few people in the world who truly understood the technology had to stop coding and take to essay writing and conference speaking in order to defend the idea before it had yet had a chance to truly mature. 
And yet everyone soldiered through the fallout that came from that WL announcement (and Satoshi's resulting sudden departure) and gritted their teeth as the old fearful world descended (and with it the business get-rich-quick brigade that saw nothing but dollar signs)...  It has taken many, many people (in both old world and new) to undo the damage from that fallout; they have written millions of words between them in essays, emails, tweets; words they would have much preferred to be typing into a compiler alongside the small esoteric group that truly grokked the 'WHY', as well as the science behind all this.  
Instead, many were forced to face their fears and go into 'the dragon's den' in the spirit of bringing everyone together so they might figure out how to shepherd bitcoin toward the light... On that journey, both the old world and new learnt a lot about each other and realised a lot of their assumptions and fears were unfounded.  Andreas [meeting with the Canadian senate]( to allay concerns is a beautiful example of old and new working together.
I think a strong argument could be made then, that the Wikileaks announcement setback the relatively plain sailing that was bitcoin development some 5 years or more (and with it, Bitcoin's ability to understand and quietly address the many problems people working in the light in that old world faced).  Whilst I understand the impetus for the WL announcement was an American financial system pulling the kill-switch on them, if money was all Wikileaks needed... then they had plenty of supporters in the UK and elsewhere able to keep them afloat (WL had a plethora of wealthy, high-profile supporters back in the day).  Similarly, they could have taken private bitcoin donations, without going public.
Ultimately, Coinbase should be commended for the hard work they themselves did during that time in easing tensions... IIRC anyone wanting to start an exchange there needed a $1m money transmitter licence per STATE simply to get off the ground... Most U.S. companies simply bailed out and moved to another country to work on bitcoin; coinbase figured out how to play within the rules and took some bold risks in doing so...   And yes, that meant complying with the same onerous set of regulatory hurdles that your average bank faces.  
It *is* sad that coinbase are having to cut ties with WL and other organisations that might raise eyebrows with old world regulators, but if that's the price we have to pay in the interim for a stable, user-friendly 'bitcoin bank' in this space that is capable of onboarding millions of ordinary everyday citizens (without risking closure) then so be it.  We must recognise with all the scams out their targeting the less tech savvy (again, because the tech came out too early) a 'bitcoin bank' is *exactly* what some people need right now.
Thankfully, this is no longer 2013 and there are plenty options out there now for those who are not a good fit for that environment.  
It would be helpful to everyone in this space if Wikileaks - instead of trying to fight the existing reality - could instead take a leaf from the [Pineapple Fund]( initiative and start focusing on the light ahead and all the good they could be doing with their holdings (thanks to those early bitcoin believers that have kept them (and the rest of us) afloat all these years).  Given Julian grew up on an old abandoned Pineapple farm, I'm secretly hoping that's exactly what they've been doing :p

Which is of course exactly what it can be likened to when good ideas start spreading through populaces.  Bitcoin is fascinating in that this is the first time such a revolutionary idea has spread this rapidly and on such a global scale, thanks to that other good idea which freaked incumbents out called "the internet".
There's a great piece in Scientific American by Michael Shermer on all this called [When Ideas Have Sex](

Here's another cut-n-paste (also known as an attributed quote) to go flying over your head.
“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” 
Although the quote is widely attributed to Sir Isaac Newton, Newton was using a metaphor that in its earliest known form was attributed to Bernard of Chartres by John of Salisbury:
“Bernard of Chartres used to say that we [the Moderns] are like dwarves perched on the shoulders of giants [the Ancients], and thus we are able to see more and farther than the latter. And this is not at all because of the acuteness of our sight or the stature of our body, but because we are carried aloft and elevated by the magnitude of the giants.” — John of Salisbury

Ok so why does 'Mad' mean 'Angry' in America, but 'Insane' in the UK?
Why does 'Pissed' mean 'Drunk' in the UK, but 'Angry' in America?  
As the Guardian article pointed out, in 33 instances of their *own* journalists using 'begs the question' only 1 of those instances was correct, even though the Guardian's own style guide warned against using it in such instances.  
If everyone on the street uses the phrase incorrectly and journalists do too, at what point do we accept that the gradual change has happened and the phrase has changed its meaning?

Here's Jameson Lopp (BitGo Engineer AND a Big Blocker) discussing privacy on LN (which he suggests is *better* than the privacy afforded by the main bitcoin chain).
“I expect that **privacy will actually be better on the Lightning Network than on-chain because transactions are not broadcast to the entire network**. It will be much harder to collect analytics on the Lightning Network because routing nodes only know the hop before and the hop after when routing, not the entire route.”
Very few us have to really worry about any of this - we've been passing our data to third parties like BitPay, Shapeshift, Coinbase for years and there have been few issues.  Bear in mind though, all of those sites have a centralised server and we have no idea what data and analytics are being collected by them.  So LN is an evolution toward further decentralisation away from 3rd party infrastructure, which is a good thing.
But in reality, why would you need to worry about buying coffee through a rock solid third party anyway (such as a LN app integrated with your bank?)  Given all the data being collected on you by card companies (and leaked via things like Walmart customer breaches) - you'd be far safer putting that stuff in the hands of a properly privacy and security aware tech company.
Regardless, as highlighted above, no such concerns with the Lightning Network itself facilitating your P2P transaction.

The issue here is that banks charge a fee to small businesses and often, the PoS terminals are also rented out at exorbitant prices.  Large chain stores (Tesco, Sainsbury's and so forth) have preferential rates with the banks and so *don't* charge any fees.  They will usually also have a bank sponsored fee-less ATM at their outlet too.
This means given the option, consumers will tend to go with the megastores because they know they're not gonna' get stung with a random sales charge; so we continue to see more and more small businesses being squeezed out by the big boys.
That's why if you walk around London and most other cities in the UK, the streets now look identical: Starbucks, Costa, Sainsburys, Tescos, Subway, Pret, McDonalds and a bunch of charity shops (since charities' property rents are subsidised) where once you might have seen a diverse range of family-run businesses and bustling independent cafes.
The knock-on-effect is a huge erosion to community relations since no-one knows their local shopkeepers anymore, which in turn leads to more crime, poverty and urban decay.

A life lived well looks at each new day as an opportunity to learn from the day before and reinvent oneself.  LARPing is nothing but training for mastering the real thing and gives you an opportunity to step out of character and empathise with a different set of moral and cultural values...  Such an ability is one of the most highly regarded, hence actors have been revered and loved since the days of Ancient Greek theatre up to modern day Hollywood.  This is because they possess the ability to change the consciousness of their audience, and with it, the world.

*"The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in 'Metcalfe's law'-which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants-becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machines."* — Paul Krugman, 1998
Do not let those who specialised in careers that have little to do with technology influence your thoughts on all this.

The best we can do if we want to say well informed, is to pay very close attention to the people actually building all this - they have far greater insight into what lies ahead than classical economists who are *paid* to write reports that don't speak the language of computer science.
Fundamentally, this is a computer **science** project... and one that has only just gotten started. 
As always... do your own research, and make your own mind up on this.  
Ordinary users decide all this in the end, just as they decided the internet was more useful than a fax machine and sites like Wikipedia proved Krugman et al very, very wrong...  Turns out people in cyberspace actually do have a lot to say to each other!

Mainstream western adoption is not (yet) the goal of bitcoin.  Futureproofed, consensus driven robust system architecture that can withstand all the shocks coming to the world's legacy financial and business systems is the goal of bitcoin.  
Paving the way to a world of abundance, an RBE and an economy that *truly* economises is the goal of bitcoin.  
Withstanding and overcoming human beings propensity to succumb to shortsighted greed is the goal of bitcoin.
It is for that reason that many of the companies and coders that grok this grander vision for the species, and understood why we built the internet in the first place have remained tight lipped; quietly and stealthily building behind the scenes with relentless optimism and patience, awestruck by where all this is about to lead when supporting infrastructure services (built for the right reasons) atop the protocol layer eventually mature and blossom...  
Y-Combinator, Google, Amazon...  These comprise the true visionary companies and technologists that will help shape the internet and guide bitcoin's future toward a world of abundance capable of taking humanity to the stars...  i.e. those people and groups that understand why it is "information wants to be free."  
There is only a small group of people on the planet that truly understand what I am driving at, born in just the right time and place to have been both blessed and cursed with learning to code back at the very beginning of home computers...  That has given them an uncanny ability to be able to see twenty years into the future, often all this seems like stuff we read back in sci-fi books and on BBS boards decades ago; in many ways bitcoin is just a self-fulfilling prophecy - a dream come true... And it is owing to this small minority having to wear so many hats whilst guiding the rest that progress seems so painfully slow to those over eager to rush to the orgasmic conclusion...  
In the meantime, we will all have to endure and grimace as all the ICO's and 'Future of Bitcoin Conferences' miss the point; just as the dotcom gold rush missed the point of the world wide web in the 90's.
Ultimately, it matters not what plays the new 'pretenders' who are just experiencing their first flushes of power in the world wide web try to do to subvert that vision.  Nor does it matter what happens to the market cap or price in the interim.  Indeed, withstanding these fear-driven power grabs, price crashes and ego-maniacal ad hominem assaults on the integrity of core... can be seen as a dry run to fulfilling the longer term anti-fragility objectives. 
The coders, tinkerers and beautiful hackers behind the grander scheme of things are the same as those that built this internet we today take for granted, and indeed were there to [code humanity out of the last crisis](  In that sense, they have seen all this before...  
We all have our part to play in this game if we choose to step up for the greater good, just as long as we remember there is no winning move.

I think the problem with holding anything (fiat or btc) that changes is in value, we find ourselves in a constant state of fight or flight when everything in the material world hinges upon that intersubjective value.
The greatest service to humanity this tech offers is the idea that one day it will lead to a single global currency and unit of measurement with a fixed value we all can affiliate with.  A bag of rice equates to a bag of rice wherever you are on the globe.
In the meantime, if you can get to a position where short-term gains/losses can't have any control over your life or happiness then OP's question becomes moot and you find yourself here for the tech and all the future gooiness I proffered above ;)

Facebook is just a tool like any other, the content and the way it can be bought by advertisers and special interest groups is a reflection on the society using it and the bullshit we  have all had to partake in to keep our websites going through advertising (hopefully Brave and other innovations will tackle that). 
People neglect to see the massive social impact and change (for good) facebook has bought to this world by bringing otherwise disconnected and disenfranchised people together; be that in secret or closed activist groups that you won't hear about on MSM, or more simpler community-driven groups.  
Not to mention, as a tool for connecting friends and family members and providing a digital diary of your history.  There's lots of growing up facebook needs to do (as does bitcoin and the internet in general) but Mark's recent solid commitments to philanthropy and his championing of things like Universal Basic Income are to be commended. 
We all have a right to grow up, to change and learn from our mistakes and, as Paul Graham once noted, Mark's strongest asset is that he sits and listens intently to others and is happy (and in fact always wants to know) when he is wrong about something.

TCP/IP merely obeys the laws of linguistics and mathematics; it is a technology, a language.  What you have said is like saying "English makes money".  Sure if you write a book you could twist it that way.  But do the words in urbandictionary.com being added on a daily basis (permissionlessly enriching our culture and growing our communication abilities) make money?  Did that caveman that first uttered the word "Fire!" do so to make money?
Of course once again people are stuck in the status quo and assuming that fossil fuels and ISP's will be around forever even though it's now [cheaper to go with renewables]( than it is fossil.  Which is why Oil Giants in the middleast are now IPOing all their oil firms and pumping the profits into tech companies like Google so they may "prepare for a world beyond oil."
Speaking of tech companies [Softtbank]( [Facebook]( [Google]( and [Elon Musk]( amongst others are all looking to make global free internet access a reality for the entire planet, since they now consider it a human right.  
And there are backup plans even for that: MaidSafe and something Kim Dotcom's working on which effectively turns every mobile phone into an internet broadcast node on a secondary TCP/IP layer, meshnets and entire towns in the UK and other places opening up free city-wide WiFi coverage funded by councils...

It's like Andreas says, people need to stop looking at bitcoin like a get rich scheme; start working out how to EARN bitcoin (both on the way up and on the way down).  
In a world that's rapidly moving towards a cashless society, begin to imagine what it looks like a year from now when bitcoin is interwoven into [banking apps like Revolut]( and bitcoin acceptance is piggybacking mastercard and visa networks.  
Online?  Paypal's Stripe have been accepting bitcoin payments for over a year now, with 100,000's of merchants now able to add bitcoin at a click of a button.  They wrote an [amazing blog post]( about bitcoin's incredible potential.  They too, have been waiting for LN.

And this is the crux of the misunderstandings in this debate: people looking at bitcoin as a "product" and not a new "technology" backbone representing *actual* real world value measurement, storage and transfer.  As such, the underlying tech *has* to be secure; no ifs or buts, no matter how long it takes to reach consensus, no matter how protracted the discussions, and absolutely it must be blind to the tsunami of eager entrepreneurs and big business interests eager to exploit the network as a "product"...
If you, as one of those budding entrepreneurs want to build a "product" that leverages the technology then great...  Go ahead... but the onus is on you and your dev team to build solutions that will take the current constraints of this technology that is *not quite yet ready for mainstream adoption* into account; NOT the underlying technology that needs to morph to *YOUR* "product" vision.
We're seeing that old world of business and finance get into bed with some of the early business-minded adopters of this technology and with it, old problems of greed, ignorance and power clouding their earlier vision (which was merely focused on survival).  When survival has become assured, and you suddenly have 'power' you must then find a new reason for getting out of bed in the morning.  Of course, core's reason for clambering out of bed has been the same from the outset: **to build and safeguard a system that will ensure future generations can live on a more equitable, sustainable planet.**  That is a 10-20 year vision and no amount of "I want my latte now!" foot stomping will deter it.
In that respect, Garzik, Matonis, Ver et al applying pressure on core to bend to short term business concerns is no less shortsighted than Verizon and co. trying to [shape the way the internet works]( to suit their own narrow self interests.  
Yes, one day bitcoin will be a wonderful way to buy coffee.  But ONLY if it the underlying technology itself remains a bulletproof system for a trusted global storage of value that is not subjected to or beholden to the interests of outside actors with little more than a monetary stake in its future.  In the meantime bitcoin continues to safeguard the assets of and feed the citizenry on the ground in places like Venezuela, Argentina, India and via the UN's WFP programme.  Every single day that bitcoin exists, we provide a safety net for people who have been subjected to the whims of reckless monetary regimes and preyed upon by corrupt middlemen for decades.  **Westerners who take for granted they live in a world with more abundant luxury than Kings and Queens enjoyed 100 years ago need to take a look at the bigger picture and understand bitcoin is, right now, solving much, much bigger issues than "1st world restaurant bill problems".**
For any frustrated entrepreneurs who have a problem with that and the slow, thoughtful progress being made to see out that longer term vision... there are plenty of 'hacks' being made that have enabled startups to bend their business models to the current constraints of the protocol (such as bitcoin debit cards that piggy back the Mastercard network able to satisfy the Western coffee buzz).

People aren't working on bitcoin for the pay.  A bunch of us nearly went bankrupt getting it this far, back when there was no outside support at all.  Thankfully those days are over.  Still, that's the level of belief in this project.  It's not about money, it's about fixing a socio-economic system that nearly plunged us all into the dark ages (because of money).


People have a problem because they don't understand the *reason* for bitcoin and they sure as heck don't understand coding and computer science or how the actual software works from a technical perspective, yet feel they can have an opinion on these things.  
The community has grown from a few thousand to a quarter of a million people on reddit alone.  In London, from 10 people in the original meetup groups to over 4000 today.  With that comes a helluva lot of noise and outside vested interests obsessed by price and business who haven't the first clue about the *actual* code or what bitcoin means for the world.  It gets increasingly difficult to go back to those original ideals, since garbage is infinitely easier to generate than truth.
It's kinda' like the UK voting to leave the EU because of the ridiculous mob mentality that came off the back of the leave campaign FUD (which wasn't based in truth or objective reality).  Then for four days straight after they voted to leave the most searched thing for on Google UK was "What is the EU?".  You would think, knowing what the EU actually was might be a pre-requisite for actually having an opinion on the matter.  
That's where bitcoin is right now.

I love the idea of Bitcoin and Litecoin complimenting each other like this; done right, this fusing of the two blockchains adds another layer of robustness and security that springboards this technology towards yet more dizzying innovative heights O_O   
I envisage real asset issuance being locked in ‘stereo’ on both chains adding yet another layer of surety (imagine escrow, P2P insurance, land registry, stocks and even trust funds requiring keys on both chains to unlock but either being effective incase of one chain failing or requiring maintenance/upgrade).  
It also means this dual-chain interoperability and support further reduces threat of attacks... spamming, hacking of centralised services, miner centralization and ‘out-group’ coercion are all rendered less effective (and pointless to even attempt in most cases). 
Possibilities are endless.

You just need to take a step back, recognise how far we've already come and that the latest hurdle is nothing compared to those we've already leapt over.  We're no longer the 0.01% of lunatics on the planet saying this could work, we're the 0.1% lol :)
Education and understanding takes time: civil rights, womens rights, gay rights, tackling climate change...  It all takes time...  But truth always prevails in the end.
As Margaret Meade said "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, dedicated citizens can change the world.  Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."
Don't fight, don't get angry, don't disparage the masses who are yet to understand the things that took you and I YEARS of learning to figure out, lest those masses come at you with pitchforks.  And don't forget that without them there would be noone to pour your coffee, or put the chips in your laptop, or fix your car when it breaks down.  We are all integral to life, all interconnected and all valuable.
Just keep spreading the truth with a smile on your face.  It is the only way to shine light through ignorance.
You sleep at night knowing you will awake in the morning on the right side of history... and in understanding how the future is predestined to unfold, you must recognise the price that comes with that knowledge and the weight of holding both great privilege and burden upon your shoulders.  
Hold your head up high and keep carrying on, and remember good things come to those who wait.

Regardless, take the longer view and we see where the mining space is going.  Consumer-level chips in everything from toasters and washing machines to your smartphone will see total decentralisation of the mining space.
That's the key takeaway here, not the "will they won't they deliver a bigger, faster, stronger miner."
AMD, Nvidia and Intel are also all making interesting noises about all this.
[Here's a link]( to a discussion around Chinese domestic appliance giant Midea, who are looking to embed mining chips in household appliances:


And here's a cool little [prototype of a bitcoin lightbulb]( that was built on Necker Island by BitFury.  There were/are plans to mass produce these.

Personally, it took me many months of long research sessions before I finally got it; even though I'd had good friends telling me it was the future and I'd even integrated it for non profit websites prior to my moment of realisation.  And I'm a computer scientist, so God knows what ordinary non-techy folks make of it all.
Did we feel the need to force MP3 players on everyone we met when they first arrived?
Lessons I've learnt along this journey - you can't force this on people; they need to be curious enough to come down the rabbit hole for themselves.  By all means, show people the doors, engage with those who are interesting in hearing more, but avoid ramming the message down people's throats.

Obviously you would still need miners even if the ledger remains private (the miners *are* the guys that produce the ledger through transaction verification).
It doesn't actually take an enormous amount of computing power to maintain this ledger. The mining race has only gotten to where it has because of difficulty increases placed in the system to ensure the 10-minute release schedule remains constant.  In theory, there's no reason the system couldn't be powered by a bunch of Rasberry-Pi's.  
The value statecoin would have is in emulating what bitcoin has produced (programmable money / contracts / efficiency), and the same consumer ease-of-use bitcoin offers can be emulated with or without decentralisation / open source ethos.
The scenario where a country might open new traditional 'digitalised' currency markets up to potentially nefarious untrusted computers (state sponsored 51% attacks and so forth), is unlikely.
How bitcoin and decentralisation may triumph will be through its open source, global and deflationary nature, but there's no reason it can't co-exist with a state sponsored closed source solution in the interim.

It also doesn't make sense that you'd give the heads-up to all the admins/vendors on the site in less than 24 hrs before giving yourself a chance to build up evidence and a case against the biggest vendors.

I often find myself reading through his [essays]( with tears rolling down my cheeks to remind myself why we do what we do.  All Aaron wanted was to get into political office one day and help build a more just world.  I remember him saying something like "If you believe you have the ability to make the world a better place and you're not doing something about that, you need to ask yourself why."  
His death, for many, was the clarion call needed to face our fears and ask ourselves how far we were prepared to go to ensure his loss wasn't in vain.  
Whilst we may forgive those who know no better... we will never forget our collective memory of Aaron and those dreams he had for a better, safer, kinder world.

This is why I said there was no *widespread* access to this kind of information.  Back then information of this kind was expensive and unless I happened to stumble upon a literary article in a random magazine I'd paid for there would have been no way of reading about Chuck's intended meaning (which neatly takes us back to the information wants to be free argument).  
I would also point out, that in the original OP, I made no interpretation of the movie as you seem to suggest (to say it *felt* like a call to arms is completely different to saying it *was* a call to arms).  Correct me if I'm wrong.
Ultimately, this is about what the average cinema goer, of a certain generation and disposition, in a certain time and place took away from the movie, and how Tyler's message resonated in much the same way that Irvine Welshes novel Trainspotting, "Choose Life.  Choose a career.  Choose a family.  Choose a big fucking television" made Generation X sit up and question the validity of the Baby Boomers "Greed is Good" mantra. 
Getting caught up on whether the underlying narrative (which is really just a love story according to Chuck) was misinterpreted due to undue emphasis being placed on Tyler's polemic, is largely a pointless exercise in intellectualism - we are chiefly concerned with the effect Tyler's message had on a generation of young adults - not whether that Generation viewed the overriding narrative through the lens of Nietzschean philosophy (they didn't).  What got Gen X excited was not the lead finally getting the girl and settling down (why would it when they were barely out of college?), but the idea of civil disobedience, overthrowing the ruling establishment and, above all else, finding purpose in a world beyond material wealth and mass produced entertainment.
The average Gen X viewer left that cinema with the Pixies still ringing in their ears and the many truisms of Tyler - "the things you own end up owning you." - taking hold in their subconscious and never quite letting go.  And those young idealistic computer geeks?  They left feeling they had a job to do.
Whether that Generation have now calmed down a bit and are able to take solace in the finer existential nuances posed by the literature, or whether the 2008 banking crisis has re-kindled their rebellious Gen X urges (I'm looking at you Russell Brand) is another discussion entirely.  But thanks for getting me chewing on these ideas. 
*"God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables – slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won’t. We’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off."* - Tyler

I'm not talking about when they're idle, I'm talking about when you're doing your email / writing a word doc / listening to music.  95% of the energy being drawn by that PSU is essentially going to waste since your GPU / CPU isn't being stressed.  Now, imagine a clever design that diverted that energy to a mining chip.  Might need PoW adjustments but that's just simple code changes and a million and one alts (including ethereum) are well versed in making. 
Same with smartphone, note I said mining would kick in when it was charging and idle.  It's drawing power from the wall outlet even when fully charged, so may as well, in that scenario, divert that energy being wasted toward mining on the phone which generates the user revenue.  
Again, all this is already being trialed with the 21inc computer. We're not talking Sci-Fi here. 
Your comment on the competitive chip market: we're pretty sure 15nm is as small as it gets so consumer rollout en masse now becomes a reality. True large scale, global miner decentralisation is the mission here in order the Bitcoin network becomes truly bulletproof and remains the go to blockchain, it's not about quick wins but seeing far into the future in order we may create the foundations for a system capable of overseeing and securing the business of all human trade and activity for centuries to come.

I believe these are the 'points'.
- Did Aaron have a right (as a JSTOR subscriber) to manually download all of that information (yes he did).  
- Did he actually 'steal' anything?  i.e. does copying a file constitute stealing?
- Should 'terms of service' violation constitute a federal offence?
- Did JSTOR have the right to charge for publicly financed (i.e. tax payer funded) research material that, arguably, should be in the public domain?
These are the issues that Aaron's defence would have challenged in court.  
Sadly, to do so meant risking 35 years in jail.  Ergo, the law is broken when it cannot be practically challenged for fear of such draconian reprisals.  Hence, the "Aaron's Law" initiative that has been backed by a multitude of prominent senators, seeking to fix this.

There have already been mining chip [powered lightbulbs]( built by BitFury that can effectively pay for the electricity they consume.  Same with your laptop / pc (most of that energy being generated is wasted).  Same with your smartphone when it's plugged into the socket charging.  See Stanford's [folding project]( - we've been using our unused CPU power for decades now to contribute to all kinds of research.


Well for a start, the lightbulb has a wi-fi chip embedded that beams satoshis to your bitcoin wallet.  So there's monetary incentive, covering cost of electricity (if using solar which is now cheaper than fossil fuels, you're actually making a profit just for turning the lights on).  
But don't discount the fact consumer devices would run these by default in order to secure the planets economic system and safeguard against 51% attacks and the like.

You could just ask Microsoft, DELL, Overstock, Expedia et al why they chose to accept BTC, but here's a few off the top of my head...
- No chargebacks.  
- No cash handling fees.
- No debit/credit card handling fees.
- Instant transfer of any value anywhere in the world for close to zero fees.
- Ability to integrate into a whole range of online application use cases not possible before (micro-payments for instance).   
And ultimately, as bitcoin matures:
- No nonsense paying their employees at the end of each month, reducing HR overhead and banking fees.
- Seamless integration with their accounting systems, reducing finance department overhead and allowing for a realtime snapshot of ledger balances and cashflows.
- Automated billing and payment of suppliers based on algorithms, with no middleman oversight required.

Don't get me wrong - I think what Amir has done is gross and tasteless.
But I am far more concerned about sex slaves and women being forced into prostitution and adult sites than those that choose to get into the adult industry willingly.
I think there should be markers on every porn site that tell you the women on there have entered into a consensual agreement to be there and any abuse lodged against the site by performers should be made public on the site itself.
This doesn't have to be forced by government, but a voluntary scheme the top porn sites enter into so that consumers can choose to go only with those that match up to their standards of ethics.
The same people that decry what Amir has done, are the exact same people who will go to ImageFap and look at any picture that comes their way without giving a single shit where the woman in the image or video came from.

Rosa Parks believed the law that said Black people must sit at the back of the bus was morally wrong, and she sought to break the law for idealogical reasons.
Aaron believed the copyright law that says JSTOR has a right to prevent millions of people unable to afford its services from gaining access to publicly funded research, was morally wrong, and he sought to break the law for idealogical reasons.
So, it all hinges on *mens rea*.
One must question the *motives* and *intent* of someone who has broken the law.  And then we must question actual damage caused, and indeed, the law itself.  In much the same way a 'crime of passion' or manslaughter is treated differently to murder.  
In this instance, the aggrieved party (JSTOR) saw no actual harm or damage caused.  In their own words:

There's a whole interesting bunch of dots to join if you expand out of bitcoin and draw a timeline of events happening around the same time (Arab Spring, Greek Bail-In, Aaron Swartz death, Snowden, massive global Occupy protests, Lulzsec and Anonymous wreaking havoc, the rise of the Golden Dawn and other right wing fascist groups in Europe, Google meeting Wikileaks and Julian bringing up Bitcoin, Mike Hearn leaving Google to join bitcoin full-time after the fuck you NSA blog post...)
There are those that get what's happened and just how close to the brink we all were and see what bitcoin means for solving the bigger problems facing humanity on a global scale... and there are those that sit in Starbucks and get what bitcoin means for a bubblewrapped little world of lattes and blockchain after parties.  For the **latte**r, we need a bubblewrapped little network [LN] capable of shielding failures from the bigger picture stuff.

Thankyou.  The fact that he was offered 6 months if he didn't go to trial vs. 35 years if he tried to protest his innocence in all of this, perfectly highlights how stacked this system is.
Regardless the circumstances of his arrest, he had a right to protest his innocence and argue the case.  But in a system so unevenly stacked in the favour of prosecutors, what person in their right mind would risk spending the best years of their life behind bars?  And, as your rightly point out, this is even worse for those that don't have the resources, support and finance necessary to foster a solid defence. 
Ultimately Aaron's class and background had nothing to do with any of this.  He was being charged with Terms of Service violation, under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, despite the affected party (JSTOR) saying they had no interest in pressing charges.

The world we want to move into is one where we don't need a fiat exit ramp, but I see no reason why, in the interim, LN couldn't be integrated into banking apps.  Indeed, the amazing London fintech banking startup ['Revolut' just announced $66m in funding to add Bitcoin into their banking app.](
So there's a seamless on/off ramp that skips the need for exchanges and 3rd parties integrated directly with your bank.  
(Their app/service is amazing btw; you can set a bank account up via the app instantly, make transfers and use the debit card abroad with no fees at all).

Yeah it's been interesting to see how the naysayers have at every juncture pointed at the potential for bad bitcoin can do (Drugs, guns, hitmen, terrywrism) and always the counter-argument of 'you can do all that with cash too' has silenced the detractors.  
The whole ransom thing is a little more tricky to deflect and we're gonna' see a lot more cases like this as bitcoin becomes more mainstream.  And I'm sure some very high profile heists are gonna hit the FUD machine like crazy (especially when hacking centralised services becomes more and more difficult, and nefarious actors have nowhere else to turn but the tried and tested mugging and extortion racket).
But you could use the same argument about guns themselves.  These efficient little devices of death and suffering are responsible for facilitating more muggings and kidnappings in America than any other technological device I can think of.  And yet no-one in America is seriously making any headway in banning them.  
And you know what? I can't seriously think of any good use case for the proliferation of guns in a modern healthy society, yet they're still legal.  Conversely, there are thousands of good use cases that can be made for bitcoin.

Ahhh.  I remember doing the same thing (sans segway) when a tour guide on [Fraser Island]( nearly bored us all half to death. 
Amir wandering from the group: I suspect it is less to do with drugs, and more to do with not wanting to feel like a sheep penned into something he wasn't comfortable or enjoying partaking in.  People with curious minds tend to do that. 
As for his accident: perhaps, rather than drugs being the culprit, it may have been simply that Amir wasn't well practiced in a new skill... Were it one of Roger's business colleagues who had simply had a few beers and done a line of sniff before losing control of her segway, I daresay it would just be another 'hilarious' story in the lives of bitcoiners Roger would recount with a smile on his face.
Btw, didn't the *actual* owner of Segway reverse off a cliff to his unfortunate demise when making way for an approaching dog?  Do we immediately assume he was high too?  
I suppose the litmus test might be whether Carl Sagan would have been able to operate a Segway after he wrote the [Pale Blue Dot]( whilst under the influence of Cannabis.  Or maybe Steve Jobs when he [took LSD numerous times]( and came up with Apple?  
Would Roger out his business colleagues that take Coke in a similar fashion, or attribute their poor decision making down to blockchain after party Alcohol binges? (both Coke and Alcohol according to [Prof. David Nutt's Lancet research]( are far more harmful than weed, ecstasy or hallucinogens).   
As for the Bitcoinica code audit: didn't Roger also audit the Mt. Gox accounts and assure everyone all was fine and dandy?  Code btw, is a heck of a lot harder to audit than financial records (that's why Twitter and Facebook have bug bounties; not even tech giants can find all the possible exploits).
But then **neither Roger's prior remarks on Mt. Gox, Amir's dodgy Segway skills, or people's lifestyle choices have absolutely ANYTHING at all to do with the veracity of Amir's opinion on the scaling debate**.  
What does carry weight is Amir's *actual* expertise in the field of Computer Science which makes him infinitely more qualified to have an opinion in this area (surely) than a man who, prior to bitcoin, specialised in being a *salesman* (read: middleman) for dealing memory chips... and has no coding or systems analysis expertise whatsoever (although is clearly a very obedient and respectable gentleman when it comes to tourism pursuits and safe and responsible segway operation).
See... anyone can start throwing mud and dragging up stupid crap we've all done in the past...  Key is trying to learn from those mistakes to avoid repetition (including understanding we have a duty to be kind and decent to one another, and publicly dragging ad hominem stuff up from the past does nothing to help inform factual, rational debate).  Clearly, should all this go wrong for Roger, he'll have a rich body of work that he can demonstrate to prospective employers at just about any tabloid gossip rag out there.
In all sincerity, I implore Roger (and indeed anyone thinking of using the same tactics) to learn the [Socrates triple filter test]( and maybe remember that talking about events and other people (as opposed to ideas) is often the product of a weak, bored mind.
Then perhaps go back to [Pale Blue Dot]( and put this whole thing into perspective (we are all on the same side for those who had forgotten).  
Amir is crazy, and we love him for that. 
 
Roger, you are also crazy, and we love you for that too.  Now start playing nice, and putting all that frenetic energy and drive you have into doing [positive things like you used to](  And remember, we are only as good as our last job ;)

Exactly.  The internet itself would never have been 'allowed' to flourish (or rocketry / nuclear fission for that matter) were it not for the propensity for us to do good with the technology able to outweigh potential risks.  Heck, we can go back to us climbing down from the trees and taming fire and evoke images of doubting Thomases sat in the forest canopy telling us this new 'cooking' technology looks way too dangerous for the elders to ever accept.  Electricity?  Same story.  Combustion engine?  Same story.  And on it goes.
Having followed James' work at the Congress­ional Research Institute I can only think that spending so much time in that old bureaucratic world of political power and control has thrown him off track a little.  Waking each morning stuck in the past, and reliving a history riddled with abuses of power can cast one's worldview into the shadows.  Spend two weeks reading newspapers in a world revolving around 'events and other people' as opposed to 'ideas and solutions', and you can literally feel your optimism being stripped away by the fear-driven hyperbole.  
Trump getting in (and the fear that came with that - see Jame's 'countdown' to next election tweets) has flipped a lot of free-thinking 'liberals' like James into a state of constant fight or flight.  Further, being in that oftentimes closed bubble that is America can be somewhat polarising; one tends to forget that this globe does not revolve solely around American interests and values.
The only way out is to surround yourself with those who believe ardently in a brighter tomorrow.  Invariably they *are* the ones making the headlines (albeit oftentimes in the science and technology section) which of course garner far fewer knee-jerk reactions or water-cooler gossip ;)
**With regard to China and blockchain**
If one has ever visited Hong Kong you will see a place where free speech is more or less as open as any Western democracy (largely due to British influence until the 1997 handover).  There is very little internet censorship there and, indeed, Occupy protests (see [Umbrella Revolution]( saw less authoritarian intervention and violence than Occupy Wall Street in New York did.  Let's not forget there are more prisoners per capita in American jails than in Chinese.  In that respect, Americans - as in the era of McCarthyism - have a lot to put in order in their own backyard before pointing the finger at other governments and/or governance belief systems.  
In conclusion, Chinese authorities would have more to be concerned about with the flow and dissemination of information coming through Hong Kong citizenry via simple word of mouth / information sharing, 'Great Firewall' VPN circumvention etc. flowing our of HK to the rest of the state than from any esoteric $30 'blockchain hack'.  There's far easier, cleaner and more powerful ways of getting vast quantities of hitherto restricted data out there, that requires no special technical nous to encode/decode: music, art and the printing press coupled with twitter, thumb drives and online video have already been doing a much better job at changing individual and group consciousness and reshaping the normative social influence, than anything that could be fudged into an OP_RETURN (a 'feature' that could at any point be addressed if deemed necessary by the community at large).
This consciousness changing free access to information goes as much for Western citizenries hoodwinked into a consumerist world of 'economic growth at all costs' built on the shock and awe doctrine as much as it does a Chinese populace that were cut off from what we see as a basic historical account of recent human affairs (arguably, a biased account written by Western victors with a vested interest in pushing their own national interests via the production line indoctrination of rote learning in the classroom).
There is much to celebrate in the unfolding of all this as [science lights a candle in the dark]( once again.  Indeed, a friend of mine recently returned from China having been commissioned to do a number of VR shorts for the Chinese public.  As I understand it, it is the intention of their government to enable every Chinese citizen to experience life in other countries through VR in order to encourage travel and migration.  The particular short I was consulted on was showing - through VR - an average day in the life of 5 bitcoiners in London.  This hardly chimes with the knee-jerk 'command and control' rhetoric we so often see in Western press when it comes to reportage on Chinese state intervention.
The truth is capable of setting us all free (including those who know all too well what lies behind that blood-soaked curtain) but only if we are all able to learn from history and forgive those who - through their own misguided fears - sought to protect us from the darkness by hiding us from the ugly truths so few are prepared to face up to.

Hahahaha, hey man, if memory serves I'm pretty sure they recommended paying the ransom in [Rush Hour]( that is before smooth-talking Chris Tucker and his trusty sidekick Jackie Chan came along with his funny accent to save the day ;)
AFAIK it's entirely up to the victims of the kidnapping whether the ransom is paid or not.  As for negotiating with terrorists, it's done all the time (how many times have we heard country X released N political prisoners in exchange for N hostages).  
Just looking into the history of the UK and IRA will confirm much of this.  And that's just the shit that's made public.  God knows how many rich bank employees and business execs have been kidnapped in places like Yemen (which you need an exit visa to get out of).  In fact, some of them have what's known as an 'emergency escape fund' to be used in just such a scenario.

The bundles of payments packaged up on LN will still need to be cleared on the blockchain.
But ultimately, all mining will be decentralised, and practically everything that uses electricity and generates heat will have mining chips in them now that 15nm chips can be popped into consumer devices.  Expect blockchain enabled smartphones, traffic lights, street lights, toasters, heaters, fridges, laptops, the lot.  
Rendering 51% attack impossible and mining centralisation no longer a concern.
Noone wants to hear that, because it sounds so far removed from what we have today, but guess what people were saying to bitcoiners 7 years ago when we were describing the world of bitcoin today?

That seems to nicely reflect the Gold and Silver analogy Charlie drew in his post...  And (spookily) sounds a lot like what happens when a star's core collapses at 100m degrees, and new elements are created in the universe via fusion (silver and gold being amongst some of the rarest created which come later in the process)...
[Explained beautifully here by Brian Cox](
"As the [stars] core collapses the temperature rises again until, at a 100m Degrees Stage 2 starts and helium nuclei begin to fuse together...[which] does two things: firstly, more energy is released so the [core] collapse is halted [and] 2 more elements are produced in that process: carbon &amp; oxygen."

I don't know what Zaps business plan looks like or the technical spec so you'd have to ask Jack what he has in mind... But, off the top of my head, this is how I could see apps running on LN being leveraged to enable zero fees to end users (and still generate profit for the startup).
I see the biggest impact being in third world countries where even low on-chain bitcoin fees is equivalent to hours of work, but let's assume it was rolled out to 1st world coffee aficionados in tandem.
- Ads.  There's the obvious route of being ad supported (yawn)
- Tiers.  Payment thresholds based on geo location / income demographics (Africans pay nothing, users in the West spending &lt; 1btc per month say, also pay nothing).
- Burn.  Angels + NGO's throw a bunch of cash at them (they will like the whole Africa thing) and they take a loss for the first few years aiming to become bitcoin's defacto mainstream payment app (similar to how youtube burnt millions in bandwidth fees for the first few years).
- Promos.  Roll in brands like Starbucks, Amazon etc. offering discounts and so forth as a way of offsetting fees.
- Merchants themselves pay the fees at the end of each day.  
Loads of options.  LN is the killer app segwit's been waiting for ;)

Why transition to VOD?  Even offering bitcoin as a means to fund the existing membership process would mean you were able to cut out CCBILL and open up to an entire new demographic that would rather not fork out that kind of information.

Yikes that's pretty fucked up was my *initial* reaction.  
I've met Amir a few times and my immediate thought is 'well fuck his account must have been hacked' (I like and respect the guy a lot).  But then, I think about it some more and I guess his take is, if they are doing it willingly, noone is getting hurt and everything is consensual, then what law should limit their personal freedom to do that?  
So now we are in the murky waters of morality: 50 years ago you would be chemically castrated and/or thrown into prison for being homosexual, this decade they lowered the age of homosexual consent from 21 to 16 in the UK and increased the age limit on smoking cigarettes from 16 to 18.
In the UK you can drink at 18, in America it's 21, in Germany it's 16.  Meanwhile you can enlist in the army and go legally commit government sanctioned murder for your country fighting fucked up wars in Iraq, from the age of 16 but aren't legally allowed to get drunk afterwards or watch a restricted movie about the war you're actually in until you're 18 or 21.  Is there any sense in that?
What about face-squatting and female ejaculation that were recently made illegal in the UK?  What right do men in suits have to tell women they can or can't do these things on film or otherwise?
I don't think there should be any arbitrary lines drawn in the sand when it comes to these kind of laws and I think they should all be analysed in context.  Is it right a 15 year old can be allowed into an 18 only club by a bouncer, get drunk, take a drunk guy home, instigate and have consensual sex with him, regret it in the morning, then have that guy sentenced to statutory rape and placed on the sex offenders register for the rest of his life?
Equally, is it right that a 16 year old with the mental capacity of a 12 year old can be taken advantage of by a lecherous 40 year old man and him *not* face any charges simply because some arbitrary law made up by fallible men said it's lawful to act like that?
To me, context is everything and if that guy taking advantage of that young girl had no hard rules to play by, he might just regulate his behaviour.  Equally, the guy who met that girl because a bouncer deemed she looked old enough to be there and get drunk, might not have had his life ruined by the same honest mistake those bouncers and bar staff made. 
But yeah, the ability to fund these kinds of things with bitcoin is *another* shitstorm waiting around the corner, one that I envisage will see common-sense and measured debate yet again prevailing over fear.

We'll never know who was searching since noone on either 'side' of the discussion (and subsequent vote) had to demonstrate any prior objective knowledge in the domain. All we do know is, the majority of the people in the UK didn't know what the EU was.  Which is the very epitome of 'mob rule'. 
I'm in favour of Athenian style democracy where people voting have to have at least a modicum of verifiable knowledge in the thing they're voting on.  
Such a system would allow us to do away with political ideology altogether and concentrate on real problems that need solving matching the smartest brains to each domain.  If you happen to be the cleverest woman in the room on transportation then I want to hear your voice regardless of what political or tribal views you may have.  
Conflate that with khan academy style voting booths that allow you to vote in micro and macro aspects of society you're able to lend your expertise to and this whole democracy thing begins to make a lot more sense. 
Beauty of all this is we get to harnesses and encourage the best in those who currently feel excluded.  Everyone has a voice.  
Let's see how this might look in Bitcoin:
In respect to core, probably they shouldn't get to say too much about UX design but a UX working group set up to support them (and any followers with demonstrable experience on linked. in etc.) should be able to weigh in on the discussion.  
Equally they shouldn't get too much influence in mining chip discussion, but jihan and others should lead a working group that does. 
Business, sales and investments working groups should be lead by Roger and others. 
Code and anything related to the protocol should be left to those who are skilled in computer science.
All the working groups feed into one another and contentious decisions go back to working groups to further discuss. 
Everyone feels they have a voice and everyone maximises their energy potential (within their sphere of expertise and influence).

AFAIK, Richard Branson has already backed this and they're being produced already.  I'm not a hardware engineer but I assume the due diligence has been done if they're going into production.  Remember [BitFury have got chips down to 15nm now](  Market dictates price will also come down obviously when things like bulbs go mainstream.  I mean who could have predicted $20 Rasberry Pi's and a PC that can fit on your big toe back in the days of Amiga A500's and 386's?


Good stuff, lest you sound like those laggards that told the Wright Brothers heavier than air objects will never fly or, you know, Paul Krugman and the billion other people (who thought, through their hubris, they could see into the future) and tell us with certainty bitcoin would never work.


Again I'm a software geek, not a hardware engineer, but I remember dedicating unused resources otherwise going idle to folding and the SETI project back in the day.  AFAIK, your PSU is drawing say 800watts of energy regardless of what your CPU and Ram is doing and most of the time that's wasted energy cause we barely ever need to max stuff out....  Our smartphones too, are basically idle most of the time when charging, lots of energy there not being used.
So it's about putting that to work.  There are other incentives of course for using extra energy as outlined in the [21inc]( vision.
Interestingly, something I've not covered is that LN incentivises running a Full Node, as [explained by Andreas here]( 
Not sure how all this will play out, I can see into the future no better than Paul Krugman, but it's going to be exciting thinking about how we can pull all these elements and ideas together to make the ultimate bulletproof network.

"We need to move to negative interest rates and phase out physical cash as 50% of it is in the shadow economy and we have no idea what it is being used for." - Bank of England
Bitcoin is merely a new tool; the real innovation is the levels of transparency and accountability this tool can enable in order to addresses many of the problems inherent in the military industrial complex.  These new levels of transparency permeate the very fabric of organised society to the point where the system only works for honest actors (silk-road being an example of how such P2P trust based economies will flourish once the mechanics are in place).  
Let's look at how invisible taxation lead to the Iraq War:
The average household in the U.S. paid something like $40,000 USD to fund the Iraq War and £9k per household in the UK, despite millions of people marching against the invasion.  If those millions of people were able to vote directly with their wallets, guess which way the war machine would have gone.  
So whilst Roger Ver's view is simplistic (bitcoin is by no means a magic wand) it is based on sound reasoning–99.9% of the world do not want corruption and violence, and if those bad actors are removed from the ecosystem, the end goal is a world of abundance, collaboration and trust.
Bitcoin, like the internet itself, isn't being built out in a vacuum–there's a whole conflation of technologies and ideas coming together to bootstrap this new way of thinking that rewards honest players.  Green tech, Automation, and inner-world economies existing in the VR space are an important aspect in this brave new future.
Things to think about as all this unfolds:
- What happens when people in micro-communities collectively governing their towns replace most of the functions of centralised councils?
- What happens when the West adopt an egalitarian voluntary taxation system (around the 10% level) similar to the Islamic model through local LETS exchange economies existing outside of the macro economic environment?  
- What happens when African and Indian farmers, makers and entrepreneurs are able to reach a Western audience directly without middlemen stifling innovation and monetary flow?  What happens when we all have a global citizen passport that can't be spoofed?
Whilst we are a way off, the above systems are the 'missing-link' that may just solve everything from resource allocation to immigration and world hunger (and with it, the chief driving force of territorial disputes and war).

Sure, I can see the logic in that, just not the logic in blowing the whole thing in less than 24 hours when you have the master key to an entire network of drug dealers/hitmen/weapon smugglers/hackers/etc...Just think of all the seized bitcoins if they could have pulled in only a handful of the top vendors...
You would at least press your suspect, or attempt to turn him like they did Hector Monsegur (of anonymous) before pulling the plug and announcing it to the whole world.  
Not to mention, how posing as DPR would have lead to them being able to build an even stronger case against him (note: they used the testimony of one Vendor they'd arrested prior to DPR, so why not arrest more?)...
Ultimately, Ulbricht was just a glorified middleman and the FBI must have known it would only be a matter of time before SR V2 came along...So why throw your VIP backstage pass away so quickly?
  
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:12:58
From what I recall, DPR encrypted the ID's and trashed them (they were sent to him personally over chat, so no ID's would have been in the DB).  
Even if the above were true, it would make more sense to keep the operation going whilst you had time (many months) to go over the forensics and the log files, and keep tabs on any new vendors/users, whilst you infiltrated the whole operation from the inside (afterall they already had agents clocking up hours pretending to be admins/vendors to get close to DPR).  
Pulling the plug in less than 24 hours gave all of the vendors and admins on the site the headsup.  Surely, you'd wait until they could make as many busts and stings as possible before going public.
It's been over a year now, and no other person related to SR has been indicted AFAIK?  Doesn't that strike you as a little strange if they had so much damning info on the laptop?

But what the blockchain tech opens up is an ability for third party developers and institutions to build solutions ontop of an established, secure protocol.  
I think you still need this kind of timestamping technology to achieve stuff like p2p transfers / smart contracts / multi-sig escrow etc., otherwise you're back to relying on centralised software / database implementations that, by design, must remain centralised, closed source and therefore rife to disruption since they still don't solve the double spend problem when  relying on the integrity of various competing institutions (or the many other legacy problems that exist because of middlemen).

Great points, all.  
But here's the thing: there is no possible winning move for the other 'side' long term.  Even if the hard fork happened and the project went in two different directions, there's only one side with all the technical nous to take this to the next level, only one side that true big industry players and tech giants (Google, Microsoft, YC alumni) will trust to maintain the code...
The other 'side' end up with the same chaotic mess we see in DAO / Ethereum / ICO money world...  It's the too big to fail MySpace (built with Murdoch's money) vs. Facebook (built with Love and passion and mad skills).  
So have zero fear.  In the end, even if we see a split, this just gives core more time to breathe, to get their heads down and move on with the important business of building bitcoin into what it was always meant to be.  The true believers get to coalesce and rally together outside of the toxic environment that currently stifles collaboration, and our strength is amplified by this newfound goodwill, trust and renewed belief in one another.  There is not a single 
one true believer with their integrity intact that won't give everything they've got to support core moving forward.
And then the rest will come at lightning pace: mining chips in household heaters, lightbulbs, toasters and every laptop...  
IMO, there's been no complacency, this whole thing has been a massive elaborate game of chess from the outset that core have guided like the grandmaster neckbeards they are ;)

Not that Amir or any other coders would be interested in going down this route...  But it's worth taking note (lest Roger poke someone who might) that Amir *is* a UK Citizen and libel laws apply to and can be filed against all online/offline journalists, editors and indeed all US Citizens (which have similar libel laws) irrespective of geo location (albeit with some complications depending on the judicial overlap).  Further, given Roger's material links to the UK (the blockchain.info HQ is in London) I doubt Amir would have much trouble tying him and his business interests to a case, especially given the nature of his post directly impacts those UK business interests.  
This isn't about Nanny state 'faggotry' it's about recognising that what we say and do on the internet and how we treat one another in cyberspace is increasingly having real world ramifications.  In short, if you wouldn't say or do it in 'real' life because of the social structures and values of mutual respect we collectively agreed upon, then we should think twice before stepping outside those values and rights our ancestors fought for, when online.
What few yet realise about this technology is that the blockchain will leave an immutable worldwide digital history of *all* our actions for which one day we will have to account.  In the not too distant future we will all have a nice little encrypted identity wrapper that all the AI bots will have traversed to figure out if you are the kind of person who can be trusted.  That wrapper will be used for everything from Global Passport and Visa issuance to job selection, to whether you get accepted at your local snooker club.  A Priori transgressions that have negatively impacted this global 'trust rank' will have a higher rate of decay than collaborative, positive scored actions ensuring that ultimately, all of society is given equitable access to social mobility and economic inclusion.  The only rule is "play fairly with one another."
Primarily, that 'trust rank' will be scored by looking at how you treated others online as a key indicator of the kind of values you encapsulate.  In fact, those bots are already here - Google's [Perspective API]( just one example of what we Computer Scientists can now deploy to begin to assess the kind of people who are contributing to the world.  Conflate this data graphing with social capital rankings from twitter, facebook and the like and we begin to see how we will soon be able to make more sense of the world and, each other. 
In such a world where we all think twice about our online footprint I daresay, using the word "Faggot" when we know it causes offense to others, will serve as a good indicator to those bots to exclude you from any conversations that require humility and sensitivity toward the feelings of others, just as you would be shunned by the crowd in 'real life' situations when you fail to adhere to common decency.  One future scenario when augmented reality is commonplace, may even see the warning sign "homophobe" flashing above your head when you enter a gay bar ;)
Understand I am not talking about mass surveillance or censorship; all of the above will be opt-in, just as exposing your personal life on facebook is an opt-in affair where generally the pros of an interconnected species outweigh the cons.  Ultimately, this is about about harnessing tech to help bring together and empower a worldwide web of trusted people who will thrive through their commitment to diversity and mutual respect for one another.  
Blockchain just adds a new, incorruptible layer that can't be tampered with by those who deal in lies and schadenfreude.

Enter big business and the lure of money and trinkets and a bunch of centralised services that turned the project into a sort of frankensteinian hybrid of what it was meant to be...   A lot of this story I think comes down to Millennials vs. Baby Boomers with Gen-X stuck in the middle rolling out backup plan after backup plan to deal with the chaos unleashed by two 'sides' trying to kill each other...
And yet there is no question that bitcoin core will survive, simply because of the people cognitively invested in bitcoin - the idea as opposed to those financially invested in bitcoin - the business.  
As Andreas points out: it matters not if bitcoin is $1 per BTC or $100,000 - its utility remains the same.  Similarly, he is right to observe that if we 'fuck it up' it can only happen from the inside, and those invested in bitcoin - the idea will get right back up and launch bitcoin 2 the very next day.

Thanks for your insightful feedback :)
The post is not a critique of the themes in the movie in of itself, but the story of the interpretation of those themes as seen through the eyes of a young idealistic class of (often) disenfranchised computer geeks and hackers (primarily male), coming of age and struggling with the same feelings of discontent with the world as 'Jack' and his male counterparts.  There were no 'rockstar' nerds back then: intelligence and passion in a subject were not as venerated as they are today.  To be a geek in the 80s/90s was often synonymous with feelings of loneliness, isolation and malcontent.  
Naively or not, IRC and BBS were where the Hackers and Cypherphunk 'Fight Clubs' manifest, and the internet gave these young restless minds a real-world (albeit virtual) proving ground to 'test out' something very close to Tyler's 'simple minded anarchistic ideas' and see where the chips may fall.  Whilst no buildings actually fell at their hands in the physical world, plenty of empires are feeling the chaotic tremors: The Jolly Roger's Cookbook, Silkroad, Anonymous, Megaupload, the Piratebay, Wikileaks, Napster, Dark Wallet, Bittorrent and Bitcoin itself - these are all initiatives and movements Tyler himself would have no doubt drafted into the Project Mayhem internet manifesto.
With respect, to say I have missed the point by not mentioning the will to power, slave/master morality or ascent to the Overman *is* to miss the point.  Good art after all, is often an entirely subjective experience.   
Interesting asides: 
- Palahniuk preferred the movie adaptation to that of his own book and lauded both the ending and the way the movie streamlined the book's scattered plot into something more coherent.  To the point where he said he felt "sort of embarrassed of the book" compared to the movie.  
- With the exception of the clubs themselves, everything in the book is based on real events and people in Palahniuk's life (Project Mayhem is modelled on the real-world Portland Cacophony Society, which is now international).
- The book ended with 'Jack' in mental hospital, Project Mayhem seemingly having failed, but there were hints that it continued to thrive underground.
- Palahniuk's squeal to fight club is slated for release in 2015 and is set to see the return of Tyler.  Palahniuk says of the sequel: "Nowadays, Tyler is telling the story, lurking inside Jack, and ready to launch a comeback. Jack is oblivious. Marla is bored. Their marriage has run aground on the rocky coastline of middle-aged suburban boredom. It's only when their little boy disappears, kidnapped by Tyler, that Jack is dragged back into the world of mayhem."

Wow, Christ almighty, there's so much vitriol in your posts I really don't know where to start.  
You talk as if the world is in this constant stasis (Dell and Microsoft only accept BTC for their consumer division - which is MASSIVE btw and now exceeds their B2B revenues - [source](  That's not the point though - The real takeaway from this is that Microsoft have done their due diligence and see bitcoin as a worthwhile payment instrument.  As for their B2B division not accepting it YET - let's not forget they only started integrating bitcoin about ONE MONTH ago (it took them a WEEK to integrate btw), so of course they're gonna' tape out slowly (same with DELL being US only for some time, before yesterday announcing they've rolled out in Europe).  
You also talk as if the world revolves around just you and your own particular use cases.  Maybe you have little problem with your bank transfers and chargebacks, but an average retail business owner can be looking at anything up to 20% in chargebacks on a monthly basis.  Same with cash handling fees and debit/credit card charges chipping away at profits.
As for chargebacks on postal items?  Escrow solves that problem (very easily done with multi-sig bitcoin transactions).   
You don't like bitcoin, I get it.  I'm not here to convince you otherwise, but I'd recommend you taking a step back and looking how far bitcoin has come in the last year alone; how much VC money is being ploughed into it, how many big, game changing companies in the tech sector are getting onboard (Microsoft, DELL, Samsung, IBM) and ask yourself "Is it possible, just possible, that I might have missed something?  Is it at least conceivable that these guys who live and breathe technology every day and foresaw the rise of the internet before everyone else might know something I don't?").
If your answer - through all your hubris - is still no, then we have nothing more to discuss.

Hmm, Yeah there's plenty of ways of getting money into anonymous accounts (see the recent $1billion hack that happened to the banks).  
Card skimming is very trivial indeed and just requires a laptop and a standardcard scanner.
Granted that's not as elegant and takes a bit more work than simply opening a bitcoin wallet, but then, a lot of things (sending money abroad for instance) isn't as elegant as doing it the bitcoin way.
My point is simply that when new tech (like credit cards / internet banking) make things simpler for the consumer, they also make things simpler for the criminal.  That is not reason in itself for stymying new tech innovations.  
Just remember, there are far more nice humans out there than bad ones :)

I think the fundamental problem is that you are looking at the world like ISP's are going to be here forever (when close-to-zero cost renewable energy is going to be a reality a decade from now).  
We will likely view internet access as a global human right, and access will be as free as FM radio is to anyone with a wireless set.  Elon Musk, Softbank, Facebook and Google are all making global free internet access a priority now.
People think today is how it always will be neglecting to see how far we've come.  Mark Zuckerburg's favourite quote is "We overestimate what we can achieve in a year, but massively underestimate what we'll accomplish in 10".
To do so with the kind of accuracy Ray Kurzweil manages to predict, we must be in the business of shaping the present (through ideas and hardwork to actually create that future).  This means stepping away from now, and taking a broad overview of where a wide spectrum of innovations will likely lead us.  It's hard to do that when you're heavily focused on the myopia of one domain. 
It's kinda' like when I predicted Spotify a decade before it arrived and people would say "Dude, YOU are crazy, nothing will ever replace CD's".  I had to just shrug and say "Wait and see."
I believe the interim step to that 10 year vision will be projects like 21inc and the bitcoin lightbulb (which are already a reality) allowing energy being used to be converted into Satoshis that, if you hold onto, will ultimately appreciate in value (so even if you take an interim hit, ultimately, as energy prices come down and computers become more energy efficient the cost/benefit ratio works in favour of the patient consumer).  On top of that we're actually seeing energy companies in Europe now buying bitcoin miners and converting surplus grid energy into those Satoshis.  So even they see this as an efficient long term storage of energy 'value'.  We're also seeing Eth contracts being used for P2P solar energy sales in the U.S. (rather than selling unused energy back to the grid).
In order to see all this unfolding it requires taking a leap out of today's status quo and looking ahead 5-10 years.  Just as we who originally backed the crazy idea that was bitcoin (and indeed ethereum) had to take the same leap of faith/consciousness and think more long term to where bitcoin would be today (7 years later).  We have to do the same here and see where the conflation of everything from Tesla's Solar City to Middle-East oil firms IPO'ing to 'prepare for a world beyond oil', to France/Holland announcing they will ban production of petrol cars, UK cities unveiling free city-wide WiFi etc. will lead us.
I, like you, have no crystal ball, I have a sharp insight as to where we will eventually be as a civilisation on the cusp of Type I status; but I have no idea quite what steps will lead us there, since there are way too many variables at play...  
We are now in completely unchartered territory; just as we were in the early days of the internet (I'm old enough to remember BBS boards and have avidly followed (or been a part of) every major computing / internet innovation since the day [I got my ZX Spectrum]( 33 years ago).
However this unfolds, I have to say, this is the most extraordinary time in mankind's history.  
The singularity is near.  And the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.

Why do we deem teenagers mentally mature enough to actually have sex and even get married at 16, but say it is illegal for them to watch others having sex on film until they are 18?
Why do we deem 16 year olds mature enough to make the decision to enlist in the army and go kill for a living (surely one of the hardest decisions anyone can make) but we don't think they are mature enough to watch Full Metal Jacket?  Why is it OK for a 16 year old to put their body in front of a mortar round, but not old enough to put that same body in front of a camera if they so choose?
Just because something is written in law doesn't mean you shouldn't question it and challenge the received wisdom of the crowd; nor should you paint those that do so as heretics.  After all, many of the freedoms you enjoy today are there because a few people were brave enough to challenge the status quo.
And that's how society progresses:  It's the reason cannabis and gay marriage is now being legalised in many places in America and across the world.  It's also the reason black people can legally sit at the front of the bus.
That being said, Amir acting as some kind of 'digital pimp' is something I find rather distasteful but, then again, if we drive something that clearly has some sort of demand underground and make it illegal, shady pimps and drug dealers are what you end up with.

Hmmm, good point, I hadn't considered that angle.  
Would be good to get a lawyer's perspective on this, as I would still argue that killing the site in less than 24 hours meant that they effectively wound up any chance of getting further 'bad guys' off the streets, along with all the drug money that would come along with that.  
You could also make an argument that they would have needed more time to further strengthen the case against Ulbricht and his associates (&lt;24 hours after arrest they couldn't possibly be sure exactly what was on the laptop that would implicate him before weeks of thorough analysis: and yet 90% of the case relied on this laptop evidence).
I don't really see it as any different to the Hector Monsegur hacking case, where the FBI turned him and - under their guidance - had him aid anonymous in committing massive high profile hacks at his behest (Stratfor for example).  In this instance, the wider-ends justified the means.

Yikes that's pretty fucked up is my *initial* reaction.  
I've met Amir a few times and my immediate thought is 'well fuck his account must have been hacked' (I like and respect the guy a lot).  But then, I think about it some more and I guess his take is, if they are doing it willingly, noone is getting hurt and everything is consensual, then what law should limit their personal freedom to do that?  
So now we are in the murky waters of morality: 50 years ago you would be chemically castrated and/or thrown into prison for being homosexual, this decade they lowered the age of homosexual consent from 21 to 16 in the UK and increased the age limit on smoking cigarettes from 16 to 18.
In the UK you can drink at 18, in America it's 21, in Spain it's 16.  Meanwhile you can enlist in the army and go legally commit government sanctioned murder for your country fighting fucked up wars in Iraq, from the age of 16 but aren't legally allowed to get drunk afterwards or watch a restricted movie about the war you're actually in until you're 18 or 21.  Is there any sense in that?
What about face-squatting and female ejaculation that were recently made illegal in the UK?  What right do men in suits have to tell women they can or can't do these things on film or otherwise?
I don't think there should be any arbitrary lines drawn in the sand when it comes to these kind of laws and I think they should all be analysed in context.  Is it right a 15 year old can be allowed into an 18 only club by a bouncer, get drunk, take a drunk guy home, have sex with him, regret it in the morning, then have that guy sentenced to statutory rape and placed on the sex offenders register for the rest of his life?
Equally, is it right that a 16 year old with the mental age of a 12 year old can be taken advantage of by a lecherous 40 year old man and him *not* face any charges simply because some arbitrary law made up by fallible men said it's lawful to act like that?
To me, context is everything and if that guy taking advantage of that young girl had no hard rules to play by, he might just regulate his behaviour.  
But yeah, the ability to fund these kinds of things with bitcoin is *another* shitstorm brewing round the corner.

Except they were, nearly without exception, all young when they did those things.  
As someone pointed out above - average age at NASA was 26 when they landed on the moon.  
Turing was 26 when he joined Bletchley park and decoded Enigma.  
Oppenheimer was 38 when he joined the Manhatten Project.
Einstein was 36 when he penned the General Theory of Relativity.  
That's not to say there aren't very smart very old people doing valuable things, but my feeling is, as we get holder we no longer have the drive, energy and unbridled ambition and enthusiasm that comes with youth, and more mundane things (kids, mortgages, staying alive!) take precedence.

@_date: 2015-02-25 23:20:02
The point is current systems like SWIFT incur significant costs, both in terms of manpower and software/hardware infrastructure.  The central bank here is interested in leveraging 'a protocol for value transfer over the internet, akin to what [Tim] Berners-Lee did for information.'  Emphasis being on protocol.
I read that as something like bitcoin (that can run on auto-pilot) but is still controllable in terms of algorithmic fine-tuning and overall network security.  
Adding more of the same infrastructure bottlenecks such as proprietary API's (which bitcoin so elegantly sidesteps) does not help central banks reduce costs or effectively challenge the crypto currency revolution.  Whereas embracing it (with some caveats) does. 
But maybe I'm wrong and it is for some other reason the UK central bank is taking an interest.

Ah, thanks for the link.  I read that he supposedly encrypted them.  Still, it shows just the level of trust the admins and vendors had in DPR.  It should have been relatively simple for the FBI to gather far more damning evidence had they setup several stings.


As I mention below, if DPR was to be used as a poster boy akin to 'Aaron Schwartz' then it makes some sense, but I still don't see the need for such haste.  
Taking their time would have meant being able to throughly investigate the laptop as well as pull his accomplices into the dragnet (and along with them, vendors, weapons smugglers, hitmen implicated in the logs and so on).   


In most states, prosecutors have up to 72 hours to bring charges. 
That time limit applies to how long you can be held without charge, but it doesn't necessarily affect the prosecutor's ability to bring charges later on.
The law also allows the prosecutor to ask a judge for more time to bring charges if they can show good cause. 
And of course, none of the above requires them to make the arrest public knowledge (even after the 72 hours).  In fact a gagging order preventing the details from going public can be applied for if it were to affect an ongoing investigation.

Well, it *is* flawed as a currency at the moment.  And noone who seriously understands and loves bitcoin would say otherwise.
We sill have some super tough (but surmountable) technical challenges ahead before bitcoin proves itself as a viable alternative to fiat that central banks can look into.  To not see that is like expecting a government in the 90's to suddenly close down the postal service in the 6th year of 'this new electronic e-mail experiment'.
I'm confident as ever, we will all get there.  Unlike the DAO, core are making sure no stone is left unturned.  We need to work on building better and faster consensus platforms and stop the in-fighting that just slows down and exasperates all sides.  Be glad Peter Todd et al are there soaking up the pressure and refusing to do anything stupid like release code that hasn't been checked a billion times.  The Ethereum headaches are a lesson we should all take heed from "Biigger, faster, stronger" != "Secure, robust, future-proofed".

I think Tom is lovely but he and his friends are having a tough time of it this year.  If old world financial modelling / MSM nudging could be applied to Bitcoin then Tom would be absolutely right.  
But since we've never had a global currency with so many variables in play before, those techniques quickly break down the more people (and indeed governments and institutions) get onboard.
You can't factor in say, a development happening in Chinese messageboards that will move Asian markets unexpectedly... or an announcement from Intel they've been quietly holding back on... Heck even well crafted memes that go viral are capable of moving the market.  So how can you factor when some random internet denizen might publish such a thing?  When George Soros fires up his Trezor?  Or when a team of developers come out of stealth with a project that completely changes the landscape?
Bitcoin is not a stock or a company.  It's something entirely new that is pulling in and encompassing the entire planetary consciousness, open to everyone 24/7.  There are no board meeting minutes, shareholder focus groups or product roadmaps that present a clear picture of the future.
This complex ecosystem that mimicks nature itself simply can't be modelled, no matter how much old world analysts want to convince their clients they are capable of doing so.  
It's like looking at an amoeba and trying to predict the exact route and timeline evolution will take over the next 3.5 billion years to arrive at homo sapiens.  Anyone who has fired up Conway's Game of Life will intuit this and understand why bitcoin price can't be predicted using conventional means.
And I'm glad that's the case.  The price dipping to these levels means once again, the ordinary people Bitcoin was built to serve get yet another chance to come onboard during the early adopter phase.
TL:DR: There are just too many random possibilities going on for anyone to be able to accurately model the path to moon.
Best analysts being honest with themselves can say is: "one day bitcoin will probably be the world's global currency and the kids being born today will think in terms of Satoshis.  It's worth putting a little bit of your portfolio aside on that reasoning alone, but don't ask me to tell you exactly how that will all play out because noone can possibly know."

Here's your citation (with bonus video link) and a few other relevant quotes thrown in for good measure.
[Source: CNN - Morgan Spurlock - Living on Bitcoin](
- MS: What's the upside for you using bitcoin?
- Store Owner: Compared to credit cards, it's cheaper, there's no chargebacks, we receive the money instantly.  I've never had a single issue and we've had over a 1000 transactions.  
- MS: So compared to a credit card, out of 1000 transactions how many of those would result in a chargeback?
- Store Owner: 15-20%.  Credit card fraud is prevalent today and as a small business owner, you assume that risk. 
[Source: CoinDesk - Marc Andreessen Explains Why 2014 Will be the Year of Bitcoin](
...Furthermore, he describes bitcoin as a very interesting way of boosting margins for online and brick-and-mortar businesses. Interestingly, Andreessen quotes Chris Dixon to get his point across:
“Let’s say you sell electronics online. Profit margins in those businesses are usually under 5 percent, which means conventional 2.5 percent payment fees consume half the margin. That’s money that could be reinvested in the business, passed back to consumers or taxed by the government. Of all of those choices, handing 2.5 percent to banks to move bits around the Internet is the worst possible choice.”
[Source: CNBC - Overstock CEO: Why we're accepting bitcoins](
"…the cost of carrying out credit-card transactions is roughly 2 percent. Given that our net margin is also approaching 2 percent, the avoidance of such fees will make bitcoin sales that much more profitable."
On a personal note, I'll go ahead and mention my friend Steve, a fellow programmer who owns 6 pubs in the UK.  I sat with him awhile back as he reeled out all the charges he gets banking in the UK: cash handling fees, POS fees had he chosen to rent those terminals as most small businesses do (he ended up programming the POS himself), processing fees and of course, dreaded chargebacks.  
He described deciding to accept bitcoin at his pubs as 'the best accidental business decision he has ever made'. [Very old Wired article about him here](  
It took him 2 days to integrate bitcoin and less than an hour to train his staff.  


Yes I was, I had just graduated in Computer Science when the tail-end of that kicked in, and couldn't find any work because everyone was laying off, despite ringing up every single web development company in the yellow pages (remember that?).  Indeed, this was principally the reason I ended up going all-in on the fledgeling internet business I'd started in my final year, living off Ramen for 8 months whilst working 16 hours a day.  Fortunately all the hard work paid off and I've never had to look back.  
I was also alive in the 80's/90's (I started programming in BASIC in the 80s at the age of 7 on a ZX Spectrum) when my English teacher told me to get my head out of the programming book on my desk and back into Shakespeare because "Computers were a passing fad".  I told him he was full of shit and got kicked out of the class.  I later ended up head IT monitor and founded the school magazine which I printed off each month on my Amiga at home.  Turns out computers weren't a passing fad after all.
EDIT: Forgot one




The Microsoft consumer division accounts for the lions share of revenue and is the largest area of growth in the company (15% vs. 3% in the business division).  This is largely due to open source solutions proving more cost-effective to businesses (both in terms of security and baseline price.  The UK government recently moved from Microsoft to Linux for instance, same with ISS).  
With the announcement of HoloLens and their foray into more hardware devices such as Microsoft Surface, their consumer division is key to future growth strategy.  
Microsoft Business Division (Office): $6.28 billion, a 3 percent increase vs last year
The Windows and Windows Live Division: $4.74 billion, a 6 percent decline
The Online Division (which includes Bing/ads): $784 million, a 10 percent increase
The Entertainment &amp; Devices Division (XBox, mobile): $4.24 billion, an increase of 15 percent.
So no, $9billion is not a 'drop in the bucket' (a moment ago you were telling us a piffling $2.5m isn't chump change so get your story straight).  And no they wouldn't be likely to kill those divisions off when they account for such a large portion of revenues and, more importantly, growth.

Well, the West no longer has child chimney sweeps, coal miners, scribes, shoe scrubbers... Technological progress brings with it a lot of change.  
Same thing happened in the industrial towns of England and America that were ravaged by a manufacturing automation and outsourcing.
The good news is noone is pulling the rug tomorrow; there's ample time to retrain and for governments to figure out programmes that will help compensate those individuals suffering the worst from the automation fallout.
Truth is, humanity needs to ask: in the world of abundance on our doorstep, do we really need to be inventing jobs for the sake of it?  Shouldn't everyone be able to do whatever it is they love?  Is it right that so many feel they are stuck in an inescapable rat race of drudgery?  Will we really need to spend the majority of our lives working when machines will be able to take the majority of the load?
As Buckminster Fuller said:
*"We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. 
We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. 
The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living."*

Yeah I wouldn't repeat his behaviour either - I think it's gross and tasteless.  
But I am far more concerned about sex slaves and women being forced into prostitution than those that choose to get into the adult industry willingly.  
I think there should be markers on every porn site that tell you the women on there have entered into a consensual agreement to be there and any abuse lodged against the site by performers should be made public on the site itself.
This doesn't have to be forced by government, but a voluntary scheme the top porn sites enter into so that consumers can choose to go only with those that match up to their standards of ethics.
The same people that decry what Amir has done, are the same people who will go to ImageFap and look at *any* picture that comes their way without giving a single shit where the woman in the image or video came from.

Vitalik wasn't trash talking bitcoin here.
Analyse the context of his quote.  He was replying to someone having a dig at Ethereum because there are multiple cryptos using PoS.  Ethereum "sticks out" because of first mover advantage it has in that area and the many dev teams and companies that have been building on and with it over the last 5 years. i.e. for exactly all the same reasons Bitcoin "sticks out" against the myriad other implementations of SHA-256.
He was simply drawing a comparison.

Maybe people over time will transition to a deflationary model, but it isn't going to happen overnight.
And whilst I don't disagree with your sentiments at all, this isn't about what we'd rather see, more what entrenched incumbents are likely to do with the technology and how they will shape it to prop up the existing monetary system (which as the paper points out is absolutely feasible).
In the long-run bitcoin shouldn't feel threatened, but vindicated in that central banks are seeing the technology behind crypto currencies as viable.  But be under no allusions, the idealogical fight and the battle to win the public over is far from finished.
In the meantime, I see no reason why both systems can't co-exist.

OP, it was actually Cyprus events that shot bitcoin prices up, though there were massive riots going on in Athens at the time, so it's all related.
It was [Zhou Tong's Cyprus Anthem]( that made me get serious about bitcoin (don't mind admitting that the vid bought a tear to my eye).
I do hope they get to default on their payments and Spain, Portugal and Cyprus follow suit.  
Merkel would do well to remember the history of her own country - let's not forget that after WWII Germany's debt was completely written off and it was Greece who were instrumental in making that happen.  Now it's payback time.

AFAIK, Cryptolocker does not infect .zip or disk image files (which is the format you'd expect most rudimentary backups to be in).  
Also, most antivirus software will pickup CL before it can do any damage.  
The way it infects users is by hiding a file extension (.exe becomes .exe.pdf) and attaching to emails.  Even basic email systems are going to flag this to the user as suspicious, and anyone working around sensitive information should have file extensions visible and be primed in the basics of email attachment security anyhow.
**There's absolutely no excuse for a law enforcement agency to be vulnerable to this type of attack.**
The absolute best defence against Cryptolocker is to simply not use Microsoft Windows (since that's the only OS it and many other trojans target).  
Perhaps if they did move over to Linux (like the UK Govt. did) they'd in turn save the tax paying public a shit ton of money on unnecessary licensing fees and security audits/patching.
The real story here is how, in 2015, a publicly funded body, responsible for keeping untold amounts of very private and sensitive data secure, is getting caught out clicking on infected email attachments (something my 7 year old nephew knows not to do).

Because you've removed an otherwise burdensome bunch of admin steps. I can envisage a future where a service like this allows you to set up all your payments in one admin panel and, once coupled with something like bitwage, all your monthly outgoings are dealt with automagically.
At the moment they're kinda' like the hugely successful company "LoveFilm" who disrupted blockbuster video by posting DVD movies to members who wanted the convenience of ordering movie rentals online for a fixed monthly fee.  LoveFilm of course recognised that online streaming would eventually upend their model which primarily thrived by bridging old and new worlds.
Same with living room of Satoshi.  As more and more landlords and merchants begin to take bitcoin, we see "bridging services" like this are in effect positioning themselves to eventually provide a seamless on/off crypto ramp for users and the businesses they're engaging with.  
Same goes for tax eventually; Arizona being the first state to accept bitcoin.  There's no reason governments wouldn't want to embrace bitcoin tax payments once the final regulatory guidelines have been locked down.  
Whether living room of Satoshi will end up being superseded by something else or whether their lightning experiments embracing layer 2 herald a more interesting pivot coming down the line, time will tell.

I'm more about getting both 'sides' back together and have them see commonsense and reason.  There is no doubt that when we were all together in this during the early years we were a formidable force (although the 'fuck you old world' rhetoric that came from *some* libertarian / voluntarist quarters always made me uncomfortable).  
I feel ideology, money, power and being in the media spotlight has now gone to a few people's heads at this juncture.
I find it quite ironic that we're here so soon facing the same struggles against fear, greed and ignorance: 
We are no longer having to oppose financial incumbents who, in my experience over the last few years, once the 'satoshi' dropped are now as excited as we all are at how this is going to change everything (really).  Who we are having to oppose, is a new type of bitcoin elite that have forgotten that bitcoin is a technology, not a business.
We created those monsters.  Let us hope we can tame them, lest they tear themselves apart.

And when you've done your time and the hoohah dies down and Arcade Fire being the best band on the planet is self-evident to everyone... if you're lucky, you will get a chance to put your feet up on the beach as [Wake Up]( plays from a strangers car, and you get to declare "our work here is done", with a wry little smile as you marvel in awe at it all... for just a little bit... until it's time to get up again and figure out how to halt humanity from collectively poking the next live electrical outlet they're waving a big metal stick at... and so you stand again... and on it goes...

Have fallen in love with JRE this past year.  It's been wonderful watching and growing up with him and seeing him evolve the format as he taught himself and others how to use the internet to properly source and critically analyse facts and ideas he's presented with on the show.  He and Russell Brand have been able to dispel a lot of myths and half truths, some of which they were both accidentally responsible for spreading in the early days through dubious fact checking.  
In the Bitcoin world Andreas' commitment to only focusing on that objective reality is what has enabled many of us to ["keep our heads when all about are losing theirs".](  It's a pleasure watching these two in action calmly and rationally discussing developments in this space.
I like to think one day all governments and their representatives will need to operate in this manner, armed with a tablet where they will fact check everything they're questioned about before spewing erroneous political claptrap that ends up holding back everyone's potential to move forward.  I expect one of the first major AI use cases will be deep semantic analysis capable of cross checking information live and flagging the audience watching with a bullshit detector when nonsense is picked up.
In the meantime, we have no excuse to remain outside the truly grounded objective reality we are all now able to share through the abundance of good and truthful information out there.  It's just a matter of effort and a willingness to admit there are some things we just don't know enough about to form a truly objective opinion (and that's ok).

Connections made from 6-7 years of going to meetups and doing whatever I could to help educate about bitcoin (panel discussions, putting people in touch with others in their field and so forth).  Helps, I guess, that I'm quite old and remember going through all this with the internet.  
Finding your local meetup groups is the best way to start.  Also lightning and bitcoin irc/slack channels are a good place to start conversing with people knee deep in all this.  Find folks that might be interested in starting/running a consultancy group with you if you want to take things to the next level (there are very few real world experts in all this, so it's wide open).

You make a fair comment but the real question is: why do people enjoy seeing fellow citizens getting extremely angry?  
It then becomes far less about ideas and learning about common sense solutions to problems and much more about getting kicks out of the extreme reactions those ideas can provoke.  Leaving nothing but a noisy fog unleashed by a crowd of cackling hyenas.
From buttcoiners to hard left/right trolls these wasteoids contribute little to human progress and will eventually be forgotten by humanity.  
There will be no future Google Doodles honouring the world's greatest Buttcoin troll, nor those trolls that post snarky Twitter comments to rile up the imaginary left/right divide foisted upon us by a political elite that long ago have been superseded by a hyper connected crowd of thoughtful citizens, who have been able to piece together our histories and make real sense of the world and inspire true positive change in doing so.  
Thank God the technology of Bitcoin will forever remain neutral to and continue to route around these primeval petty human instincts that spawn the most ignorant of luddite mobs (who will be nothing but a stub in our history books in the grand scheme of things).
To build on a turn of phrase from Aaron Swartz: "if you believe you are capable of making the world a better place but all you're doing is trolling fellow citizens trying to do just that, you need to ask yourself why that is."

We overestimate the progress we'll make in a year, but underestimate where technological change will lead us to in a decade.  
It was just  a little over 10 years ago that the first generation of smartphones began to roll out to early innovators.    There was no 3G, no ubiquitous WiFi... The world we take for granted today was completely unthinkable to most back then.  People would sit outside of blockbuster video and laugh at the idea of being able to stream movies to a smartphone in realtime via an always on internet beamed down by satellites.  The obstacles to getting there seemed too much like science fiction for most to accept.

I remember during Iraq the *only* way to get much of a sliver of truth about *anything* going on was to watch *all* the reports from BBC, CNN, Channel 4, Al Jazeera... Then attempt to piece together some semblance of an event from the mosaic of noise.  
This is basic stuff you cover in history when studying propaganda techniques used by both allied and axis powers.  *Both* sides lied to newspapers and the populace at large.
Today's world is even more complex; but the techniques for truth discovery remain the same as they ever have: analyse and cross reference source material, look for bias, perform critical analysis, listen to information coming from both 'sides'.  Sometimes it's the information those 'sides' omit that can be the biggest tell.
Be ok not accepting any 'truth' unless you're satisfied with that critical analysis.  
Then, think for yourself.
RT, CNN, BBC... It's all the same, a nice little distraction to keep you from realising just how powerful we all are when we choose to switch that TV set off and truly engage with the real world.
In respect to Max.  Well, he's hugely biased toward bitcoin; he made his name by going to war against banks and has had a burning vendetta that's been with him since his days on Wall Street.
He makes a lot of important observations that have come from his years of experience in finance and the world of Bitcoin and has a lot of great, knowledgeable guests on.  But he no more knows the future than the rest of us do.  
At the end of the day, he plays a sorta' Jon Stewart Daily Show role for the financial world.  Jon was of course always the first to remind everyone, he was an entertainer.

The yawnfest of "billionaire investor false emperor says x..." posts stop and the blockchain lambo kids hiring superyachts and actual lambos for cringeworthy stunts like consensus get bought back down to earth along with those billionaires that got everyone so hyped.

Yes. A bunch of programmer friends in the 90s told me MP3s would never replace CD's.  Their reasoning being nothing digital could synthesise holding the 'real' physical thing.  I'd think hmmm why do we go to concerts then if holding a physical object had much to do with why we listen to music?  Why were we happy with a poor quality bootlegged live recording?
I guess a lot was to do with ostentatious displays of wealth that carried with it status...  Noone wanted to think the £10,000s invested in their music collection would one day go up in digital smoke.
Similarly today, there are people who have invested trillions in an old world system they are loathed to see change.  We're also incredibly lazy as a species when it comes to learning new stuff and embracing change.
In the end though, if ordinary people see the value in that change it matters not how many people dig their heels in to guard the status quo - whether to protect their dusty record collections or bars of physical gold.  Change gonna' come in the name of human progress.

Brilliant critique :)
Whilst 4chan style memes are great for the net generation that just 'get it' I think we are trying to fight a much bigger battle now as we see Bitcoin gaining mainstream attention and being ravaged by a press hungry to see it die a death...  
We've got the tech savvy younger generation already intrigued - that's what got us this far... But now we need to instill the same sense of curiosity in the wider demographic.
What better way to do this than to yank them back to the memory of their teens and early 20s, when it was they who were the early adopters?  So that symbolic link between old and (not really so) new is the emotional pull here, and it intentionally carries no call to action - but dangles just enough info to nudge them in the right direction should their curiosity get the better of them.  
Far better, I think, to use subtlety and play on intrigue than to push confusing gen x/y memes that would be liable to put them on the defensive.
No reason it has to be a singular campaign confined to a narrow demographic... For the rest of us - less touchy folk - fuck it yeah totally agree with you, let's have Mario dressed up as a rich plutocrat jumping around a level on Marioworld attempting to collect dollar bills whilst being pursued by a bitcoin firing Nyan Cat :)  Or something.

Requiring physical substrate to effectively distribute.  Perhaps I should have written "purely digital" to clarify.  
These were the early days of CDR's and VCD's.  CD and vinyl collections were folks pride and joy (and still are to many DJ's - nothing can beat a decent vinyl set played on 1210's).    


Hindsight is 20/20.  And knowledge != imagination.  
Likely we will be saying the same about our programmer friends today who are hellbent on launching ICO's and working on the many alts that will almost certainly go nowhere.
Then, as now... many coders were still working for 'the man'.  Blockbuster/EMI et al had no inclination whatsoever to see their empires (built on the production and distribution of physical goods) suddenly get disrupted by the world of free flowing music and film those Napster-loving 'pirates' envisioned.  It would take 10 years to get from Napster-&gt;Spotify and the idea of purely digital streaming music and film collections being something humanity would come to find 'normal'.  
There were a whole bunch of barriers (DRM etc.) to be traversed before industry lobbyists finally capitulated and (more or less) embraced that world.  The iPod forming a bridge between the two worlds and Apple Music holding their hands with DRM helped a fair bit with the transition.  Swap DRM for KYC and that begins to look a lot like the role Coinbase currently play in the old financial system.
It's difficult to explain all this to people who don't remember a pre-internet world who see things like spotify and social networks as normal.  Just as the early birth pangs of bitcoin will be hard to explain to new generations who will have grown up always thinking crypto currencies are a normal thing.

I'm not saying he wasn't the mastermind behind SR.  He sure does look guilty in light of everything discovered on his laptop, and I've looked at his posts on bitcointalk and even stackexchange.  Couple that with his GMail and so on and it's hard to pull the patsy line...
But...if the target was Silkroad, and the wider criminal conspiracy and network of vendors (which it should have been) then DPR - as a mere middleman - should not have been the be all and end all of this investigation.
However, if he was some kinda' Aaron Schwartz fall guy the feds wanted to simply make an example of then that's another thing entirely, so mission accomplished and a big *slow clap* to the man.
But, like the war on drugs itself, it's a futile mission, as was evidenced with the relaunch of SR just a few weeks later.

*From the beginning of Swartz’s career he partook of the alternate vision of the Internet, the one with a more anarchistic or anarcho-socialist character. When he was 15 years old he participated in the launch of Creative Commons, the immensely important content-sharing nonprofit, and at age 17 he helped design Markdown, an open-source, newbie-friendly markup format that remains in widespread use.*
*As an adult Aaron Swartz took sides in this contest, moving away from the libertarian Silicon Valley model of the Internet and toward a more radical and social conception of the meaning of freedom and equality in the digital age. It seems possible and even likely that the “Guerilla Open Access Manifesto” Swartz wrote in 2008, at age 21, led directly to his exaggerated federal prosecution for what was by any standard a minor hacking offense.*
*Swartz posed a direct challenge to the private-sector creep that has eaten away at any notion of the public commons or the public good, whether in the digital or physical worlds, and he also sought to expose the fact that in our age state power is primarily the proxy or servant of corporate power.* 
**So, if neither MIT or JSTOR wanted to go ahead with prosecution, ask yourself why the government wanted to get involved?**
*He had already embarrassed the government twice previously. In 2006, he downloaded and released the entire bibliographic dataset of the Library of Congress, a public document for which the library had charged an access fee.*
*In 2008, he downloaded and released about 2.7 million federal court documents stored in the government database called PACER, which charged 8 cents a page for public records that by definition had no copyright. In both cases, law enforcement ultimately concluded Swartz had committed no crime: Dispensing public information to the public turns out to be legal, even if the government would rather you didn’t. The JSTOR case was different, and the government saw its chance (one could argue) to punish him at last.*


Offering him a plea deal is largely a symbolic powerplay: if he took it, it would send out a message to any other 'hacktivists' in Aaron's position, that they would be hounded in the same way.  If he didn't take the deal and challenged existing laws on private-sector ownership of public information, then it's just quite conceivable someone in his position would have been able to help change the existing legal landscape; certainly his arguments would have resonated and inspired many others to follow in his footsteps.  Just like his arguments against SOPA inspired Wikipedia, Google and Reddit amongst others to fight against internet censorship and eventually defeat the bill.
I'm sure Aaron would have gladly risked 6 months or even a few years in jail for the right to air these ideals at a fair trial.  But, 35 years?  How is that even comparable?  It is in fact a gross violation of The Eighth Amendment "prohibiting the federal government from imposing excessive bail, excessive fines or cruel and unusual punishments".
That's not just me saying this btw, several senators are arguing for the same reforms ([See Aaron's Law](
If you have a genuine interest in this, I recommend watching [The Internet's Own Boy]( and reading up on his work on Creative Commons and his [Guerilla Open Access Manifesto](

It cost them about $500 to put links to a few porn sites in the blockchain, how much do you think it would cost to put an MPEG into it?  And to what effect?  Nobody can read it unless they are specifically looking for it, and the are better and cheaper ways of encrypting and disseminating data on the internet (Mega.co.nz being one of them).

*"We have not been served nor notified of such a lawsuit (except from your email), so it is difficult for us to comment at this point in time. We will review this within the next hours." - Mark*
*"Today, CoinLab regretfully filed a formal complaint in Federal Court against Mt. Gox...we were often left just apologizing to our alpha customers while their own businesses suffered. I'm just not willing to put any of our customers in that position" - Peter*
There is only **one** member that resorted to tired old legal tactics whilst going behind the back of a colleague.  There is only one member that failed to consider the wider ramifications this will have on the community at large (and if I were to be cynical, I would also go as far to say there was only one member that had insider knowledge on what was about to happen.  Would he have urged his 'alpha' clients (all with MtGox accounts don't forget) to pull out their money prior to the Gawker leak, in preparation for the inevitable price drop?).  The whole thing stinks.
In effect, Peter is saying "The immediate needs of my (alpha) customers are more important than the foundation and the longterm stability of bitcoin"
Whatever your take, and whoever is right or wrong in the argument, none of Peter's actions are inline with the ethos of the foundation's core principles.

Since I'm talking DNA storage here, I'm looking much further into the future, needless say storage medium won't be evolving in a vacuum...  
If we are to assume DNA storage becomes ubiquitous in a decade or so then we can also fairly assume that by then 5G (6G/7G?) will have evolved into an always-on worldwide global internet access grid that will have near instantaneous download capability.  If bitcoin is eventually reaching its potential as the global currency of the world, then eventually storage medium *does* become a problem if the trillions of transactions happening every second are to serve the entirety of the planet and not just a select few with access to giant server farms.  Even *with* Layer 2/3 solutions successfully rolled out this is something that one day will need to be addressed if we are to reach our full potential.
Assuming the above all pans out, bitcoin scaling arguments circa 2018 begin to look a little silly in hindsight since many of the smart people involved in those early discussions failed to see the adjacent possible on our doorstep.  Such an outcome rendering their old fashioned thinking (couched in a technological status quo) as obsolete as the magnetic hard drive platters recording their shortsighted thinking to the pre Web 3.0 internet :p  
Remember, none of us would even be here if Hal Finney and other visionaries hadn't had the foresight to see 10 years beyond the technological environment bitcoin was born into.  They saw things like sidechains nearly a decade before the technology and wider ecosystem matured to make them feasible.
We must think about scaling in the same manner whilst doing everything practicable to champion short term solutions that make sense (like lightning) whilst remaining focused on the bigger picture (and wider tech landscape) unfolding.  That's the only way to stay ahead of the curve.

Nothing that deep I don't think - a million quid was the total profit from all their record sales, and it was a more of a 'fuck you' statement to the record industry and the art world.
They began by nailing 1m quid to a board, then tried to get it exhibited in art galleries, but none were prepared to pay the insurance money.

As someone who remembers getting excited when floppy disks doubled capacity to a whopping 1.44mb... I can't help but think we're all gonna' look a little silly when [DNA storage]( becomes the norm.
Currently all the world's information could be stored in a single room with such a solution.  Imagine how trivial storing the bitcoin public ledger would then be.  Whilst it may sound like Sci-Fi to some, like it or not, that is the world in which the invention of bitcoin ultimately finishes.
When that happens people will look back on these tweets and scaling arguments and laugh in the same way we laugh at that IBM dude who said the world will need no more than 5 computers.

Actually, I started my first internet business singlehandedly at the height of the dotcom bubble when most others in the industry were bailing.  And i've done just fine cheers.


It's the reasons that they were wrong that is the crux here.  They were  shortsighted and ill-educated regards technology and they failed to see how this technology would unravel and pervade every corner of society.  Computer Scientists didn't lack this vision or understanding and the fact that you don't understand why Napster and Bittorrent are relevant puts you in the same camp as Krugman et al.


Thanks for your concern.

There's more than one way to 'get your due', on someone who appears to have reneged on a contract.  Considering Mark wasn't even aware a suit was filed yet Gawker had been strategically leaked the story in advance is a pretty sorry state of affairs.
Contracts may be binding on the surface of things, but they can often be suffocating when one or more groups in the proceedings feels that certain contractual obligations can no longer be met because of a change in conditions.
I have on two occasions faced the prospect of court proceedings because of contractual disagreements with clients and on both of these occasions they were avoided by conducting lengthy round the table discussions until all parties could reach a mutually beneficial agreement / compromise.
**Going legal should always be a last resort:** it saps the time, money, creativity and sanity of all parties involved when their energies could be better expended elsewhere (like building cool stuff).
I won't even go into the fact that it is clear Peter and his 'Alphas' likely made a fuck-ton of money by selling en masse prior to the leak.

You could always re-list it on ebay and see if you can offload it to someone less nervy about the risk.  Personally, I think you've overpaid and would have been better off joining an [avalon chip group buy](  But, like others say, if the price goes up over the next few months you should be ok for a bit.  
But then again, you could argue that just straight up buying that many bitcoins would be more shrewd (especially if you buy on the very many dips and offload 20-30% on the peaks to cover your risk)

Hmm, you make some good points about traditional businesses (such as the florist shop setting up on a street corner etc.).  But VCs don't just gravitate to young, hi-tech companies.  Take inventions for instance, the archetypal mad professor that comes up with a new way of powering a vacuum cleaner: the traditional route has always been VC.
I maintain that banks traditional loan structure will indeed become obsolete as P2P lending takes off.  Increasingly people are looking to places like Kickstarter and Zopa (a peer to peer lending platform) that allows businesses to develop from crowd based funding and, by cutting out the middlemen, are able to take advantage of much more attractive rates and payback terms.  
Bitcoin fits nicely into this market, and we will undoubtedly see traditional lending companies swiftly adopting the platform (infact I know someone in London who has made a fortune from online loans / mortgages and securities who is looking very seriously into doing exactly this with bitcoin).
So, just as MP3s and Youtube have shaken the entertainment business to its very core, so too will these types of P2P lending instruments with finance.  It was really an inevitability of progress and innovation.

It is riskier at the moment yes, but that's because we are currently at Ground Zero, and bitcoin is still very much a nascent technology. When hardware wallets come out, BTC will be safer than having a credit card since you won't be subject to identity theft. And, as these hardware wallets become commonplace, you will see insurers getting involved.  Think about it, you trust your online banking, because you have a little dongle the bank gave you that authenticates your login.  Expect the same 'bitcoin for dummies' devices to be launched for BTC.
As for where we are now, it's plenty safe for those early adopters know what they're doing.

I'm sure I could write a script to pull up negative comments and perform some basic sentiment analysis, then cross-reference that with age of accounts and we'd see a massive correlation between throwaway and very young accounts and posts designed to instil FUD (kinda like your account history actually).  I think we'd also see that they're often only active during 9-5 on working days.
If I get some spare time, I'll do just that.  What would this prove?  That there are accounts here that are created solely for the purpose of negatively steering conversation and sowing FUD.  
What could possibly motivate someone to act like that except money?    
When a single tweet can help spark events like the Arab Spring, it would be naive of us to think that corporations aren't taking the narrative that is playing out on social media very, very seriously.

MtGox have had about $20m a day flowing into new accounts and about $1m a day being pulled out.  This means there's a bunch of speculators waiting to see which way things are going to go before they fully commit one way or another.  The stability of the price over the last few weeks suggests bitcoin has found a natural equilibrium where devotees are happy to hold.  So, barring any major fuckups at MtGox or a major online wallet getting nuked by the evil blackhatters we can only conclude that some hint of a major announcement from a big player will jumpstart those speculative stragglers into action.  
We will probably see more crashes when this starts happening, but I don't ever see it going below the current value.
Whether that means it's overvalued?  I don't think so.  It's not really about what can be done with it right now, it's what will be done with it in 3 years time, and having the foresight to see just how many markets are going to be disrupted when it gains critical mass.

[Bank of England Research Paper - Page 32](
"The emergence of private digital currencies (such as Bitcoin) has
shown that it is possible to transfer value securely without a
trusted third party. While existing private digital currencies
have economic flaws which make them volatile, the **distributed
ledger technology** that their payment systems rely on may have
considerable promise. This raises the question of whether
central banks should themselves make use of such technology
to issue digital currencies."
The term distributed ledger used in conjunction with their reference to bitcoin and the lack of a trusted third party need suggests they mean "Blockchain" P2P technology.  
The paper goes on to say:
"One important issue is the type of technology which could be
deployed. There is more than one way in which a distributed
ledger system can work, and remuneration would have to be
designed in such a way as to incentivise honest participation
in the system without leading to socially inefficient
over-investment in transaction verification. Further research
would also be required to devise a system which could utilise
distributed ledger technology without compromising a central
bank’s ability to control its currency and secure the system
against systemic attack."
Note they mention **honest participation**.  Needless to say, if they weren't thinking in terms of decentralising the whole thing, honest participation would be a given.
So yeah, when they say 'direct' I think they *do* mean P2P.

Whilst I commend your efforts in solving this problem, I am afraid to say that you are gonna run into a bunch of trouble.  Being the only bitcoin vendor offering such a service will be a magnet for credit card fraudsters.  
I have thought long and hard about this problem and the only way you can alleviate the risk of fraud would be if the user has to provide a physical address that matches card holder details and you then deliver them some kind of voucher code to said address, that they need to use to activate their purchase in combination with SMS verification or something similar.
You still run the risk of chargebacks of course if the customer gets cold feet and the banks will always side with the customer in these kinds of scenarios regardless of what your contract of sale says on it.
My other point would be, why are you storing the credit card details at all?  I wouldn't go anywhere near a bitcoin service that holds my CC details on file - your are putting a huge target on your head for hackers intent on breaking into your system to steal customer data.

There's a bar somewhere in the UK where the prices of the beer they brew in-house fluctuates in realtime dependent on the changes in hourly supply and demand.  
Crypto enables all kinds of pricing fluidity like this.   When every barcode is linked to realtime supply and demand networks for example, you're gonna see a great equalising effect that removes those unfairly marking up prices.  That will happen globally.
What this will eventually means for realestate pricing around the world, for instance, is staggering.  AirBnB and Uber's fair pricing discovery on steroids in effect.
Seems we are just a few small steps away from realising Bucky Fuller's vision of a truly equitable and sustainable world where *real* wealth can be properly measured outside of the myriad tribalistic noisy systems of control and the intermediaries they employ to artificially engineer markets in their favour.
Now we just need a whole group of 'adults' yet to understand all this to follow Bucky's other sage advice and go back to school.  Indeed, mature students paid by employers to go back to study may be just the thing that saves our ailing university infrastructures during the great transition to utopia :p

If bitcoin is to thrive it will be from mainstream adoption.  If it is made illegal in the States (like online gambling), it will drive bitcoin underground, large businesses will bail out and the price, VC support and user adoption rates will drop accordingly.  The US are unlikely to act unilaterally here, and they would likely seek a cross-country agreement to blockade the currency in order for any such ban to be truly effective.  This would be relatively easy to achieve with the EU.
This does not mean the currency will die entirely (since there will still be inherent need for BTC transactions as an enabler on underground sites like Silk Road), but in terms of gaining widespread adoption and an end to the financial debt based tyranny we currently face?  It would be game over for bitcoin.
So, perhaps we should all be a little less cavalier about the future of bitcoin and, instead of trumpetting its ability to 'Destroy The Empire', perhaps we should focus on encouraging those within the existing establishment to adapt to these changes, rather than resist.  Certainly, we are not going to get them to do that by gleefully lobbing mortar rounds at them.  I'd much prefer we held their hands and told them everything is going to be ok.

I am surprised no-one has released an open source exchange yet to allow for rapid deployment.  There are so many programmers out there itching to set them up but all working on individual projects in this regard (I am one of them).  But, perhaps if we pool resources and look to release this to the community as a whole we can alleviate many of the stresses we have seen.
We could then put together a central platform that doesn't do any heavy lifting but merely links all the different exchanges in one place and aggregates price and bid data.  Setting individual exchanges up by territory would enable us to reduce stress on the system and load balance the footprint.  
In order to keep things robust, we give users one universal login that works on all of these linked exchanges.  DDoS attacks of the nature we've been seeing would be very difficult to pull off in this scenario since a user could bounce between active exchanges that are visible via the main central platform.
As an incentive for programmers to get involved with this I would suggest anyone who climbs onboard is given an equal share of the profits across the whole network, regardless of what individual territory they have decided to setup. This could perhaps be divvied up by the amount of time they've committed to the project.
If anyone thinks the above ideas have some merit, please get in touch, I would be happy to start collaborating.

Yeah, they've seen increasingly diminishing returns in the wake of piracy.  It's far faster, anonymous (and free!) to just use shady sites linking content to online lockers like rapidshare and/or torrent sites.  Users can also dip into content from multiple website providers via the piracy route.  Bitcoin changes all of that: you will see porn aggregators that link to content from multiple sites grouped by a particular niche and users will be given the freedom to pick and choose what they want and *still* compensate the content owners.
I would expect all adult sites will implement this within 12 months.  Would be interesting to get some figures to see how much the adult industry is worth, because we can add that to the projected BTC market cap right now :)

I'm not sure how much processing speed factors into any of this.  Although I'd imagine there will be breakthroughs there too.  I also see the next decade is going to be an exercise in making more efficient use of resources we *already* have in abundance but don't currently do a very good job of sharing broadly.
This goes for computing power as much as all the other criminally wasteful things we all think is 'normal'.
I imagine we can expect to see humanity putting to better use the trillions of clock cycles currently wasted via a massively distributed global compute grid (think BOINC on steroids) that we can all tap into from a dumb terminal running in the AR/VR cloud.  Indeed, lightning may even end up incentivising such a system.
Why buy an Xbox 720 when there's a perfectly good emulator running in the cloud you can pay by the minute for with all the games in the world available on demand?
I find it stunning to see an Amiga A500 - once one of the most powerful home computers on earth requiring state of the art hardware in a huge bulky machine - now perfectly emulated on a PC taking up only a fraction of the memory that MS Word does.  
There's no doubt code and O/Ses need to be more efficient.  Will a new O/S rewrite the rules on this front?  Who knows.  When we've solved the climate crisis will the next one be a compute crisis requiring everything to be rewritten in the same manner y2k required mass intervention?  Who knows.
Bitcoin has been a beautiful example of truly resource conscious programming that ought serve as an object lesson to the 'move fast and break things' crowd who have filled the software world with bloated, resource intensive rubbish.
On the hardware side, I'm no expert but there's quantum computing which looks promising and likely many more breakthroughs around the corner.
Certainly when we look back, i'm quite sure today's scaling debates will look like a group arguing the best way of storing MP3s on floppy disks.  Why am I so sure?  'Cause this is the third time I've witnessed this happen in my lifetime and I've learnt no matter what naysayers tell people is impossible, there's one adage that never fails to ring true:
"Where there's a will, there's a way."

Seeing as Satoshi hardly veiled his disdain towards the current financial system we can only assume his plan, if he has one, will be at one with those ideals.  I doubt very much he cares about the money and any that he did cash out I'm sure would go toward strengthening these altruistic future world visions.
To quote Russian maths genius Grigori Perelman* when he turned down the $1m prize for figuring out the 'Poincaré conjecture'.

Riiggght yeah, and when there's not enough paper dollars to settle that debt, the Fed Reserve prints more physical dollar bills to give you the illusion that your money is nice and safe and all 'accounted' for.  Hence a dollar bill 100 years ago is currently worth about $0.04.  And who actually owns the Federal Reserve that you have so much faith in being accountable for the money they are backing?  Well, no-one knows...
Then when QE doesn't work out we get the kind of situation Cyprus has just witnessed where banks just seize your debt because national debt is out of control... and these banks are accountable to who exactly?  No-one.  Of course the bail-outs are just a more PR friendly way of achieving exactly the same thing.
Bitcoins, on the other hand, do indeed represent absolutely nothing - except the collective belief that others have said that they have value.   But guess what?  The no longer gold-backed dollar bill that we all covet so much represents absolutely nothing to - except the  good faith belief that your government have said they have value.  That belief quickly crumbles if you live in Zimbabwe or Argentina, or when Banksters sell subprime mortgages in a game of Russian Roulette that undermines that good faith belief the whole system relies upon.
[This is what happens when fallible, greedy humans are in control of the machine](


So does the collected reserves of $300billion sat in the bank accounts at Apple Inc. not represent wealth?  Of course it does, just as it would if they converted it into gold coins and dumped it all into a Scrooge McDuck stylee money pit.  Just as the $1 you hold in your hand represents wealth.  It's just that 1's and 0's - be they bitcoin or your bank balance - are just a little easier to manage.

On the Dutch Tulip Mania thing, what bothers me about this analogy constantly being quoted is that anyone who has actually looked into it would realise the reason the 'bubble' burst is not because people lost faith in the inherent worth of Tulip seeds.  No, the reason it crashed was because the spread of Bubonic plague meant that no traders turned up to the market.

If you look around r/bitcoin, you will see the advice of most redditors here is "Bitcoin is still a nascent technology and subject to many crazy swings.  Do not get involved with it if you are not open to risk".
Should OP use a volatile currency of this nature?  Well, as I mentioned in my post, it depends if he/she is prepared to be patient.  Over the past 6 months value is up some 300% so yes there are plenty people using it as a currency, despite the volatility.   They did not complain about the swings back when noone cared about bitcoin, and they are not complaining now.
Infact it is really quite rare to see a post from anyone who is disillusioned with bitcoin in here, as most people are in it the for long the game and know the risks.  And it is this risk/reward ratio that makes bitcoin such a truly compelling proposition: Could it be worth $3000 in 6 months? Yes, certainly.  Could it be worth $0?  Yes, possibly.
So no-one is dodging the question here: There is no way to answer the question "Why would I continue to use a volatile currency?".  He could just as easily be asking the question "Why would I invest in Amazon?" back in 1995.  You either get it, and believe in its long-term viability, or you don't.
This is not a get-rich quick scheme, there is no hard sell here.  If you fall into the latter camp, the advice is clear from most bitcoiners **"Don't use it, don't invest, and hopefully we will see you in a few years if it stabilises."**

If that were true then society would never progress.  Look how far we have come in only the last 40 years: civil rights, women's rights, the end of the Vietnam war...All because individuals chose not to adhere to the spirit of the times, in spite of indoctrination imposed by powerful actors in government.  
The NSDAP were elected because they seemed to offer a lot to a great many people during tough economic times.  However, once they got in power and started the war machine in earnest the vast majority of Germans did not support Hitler's 'final solution'. 
The vast majority of humans are decent and law-abiding and want for nothing but a comfortable life and a bright future for their kids.  We may disagree on how we get to the goal line but, for the most part, we all agree on the fundamentals of what is right and wrong even if these breakthrough moments are often happening at a snails pace because of government legislation.  Just look at the swathes of gay marriage laws being changed across the world right now (16 countries at last count making it legal), to get an idea of how quickly the zeitgeist can often change.  This is only happening because the *majority* of humans see it as the right thing to do.  And yet, just 10 years ago this would be unimaginable.  40 years ago and it was still illegal to be homosexual.  Lest we forget Alan Turin, the father of modern computing and WWII codebreaker, committed suicide because the Brits found out he was gay and gave him the choice of prison or chemical castration.
That is the beauty of the crowd and what true democracy enshrines.  The internet helps us make those decisions much faster and gives us the tools to finally harness that crowd wisdom without requiring middlemen with their own agendas and egos to satisfy.

Here's a potential solution for allowing users to buy BTC instantly via credit/debit cards:
As site is setup that allows users to purchase BTC which is added to a 'pending' balance.  Upon checkout a bitcoin voucher code is created and mailed out to the buyer.
A verification code (on the voucher) needs to be entered in order to activate their wallet balance (alongside say a pin that was sent to their mobile phone via SMS).  This would alleviate most of the fraud issues (possibly entirely?) since any purchase would require that the card details match the delivery address.
The only issue is with chargebacks - if we deployed this with the kind of volatility in the market we've seen this week, the system would likely fail, but for those who are currently sitting on a pile of BTC they bought at a low price, I think it's a worthy idea to invest in.  Most people, after all, are decent, honest individuals.

Whilst not instant, it's a valuable service in that you can actually use a credit/debit card to make a purchase.  The delivery wait isn't necessarily an issue if you facilitate the sale immediately and simply add it as a pending customer balance subject to it being confirmed upon voucher receipt, which I daresay you could get mailed out within 24 hours.  Sure as hell beats the 5 day wait at coinbase anyhow.

I spent 2.5BTC on the upcoming conference.  Becoming a member is something I had planned on getting around to at some point, but in all honesty, I have been busy on other bitcoin related projects and figured they were getting on fine without the need for input from a nobody like me.
Incidentally, Jeff Berwick is not a member either.  By your logic, does that mean he should have no right to discuss and reflect on how things are being run in a foundation that purports to represent the bitcoin community at large?
Do I not have a right to air my opinions on MtGox, or Electronic Arts for that matter, if I think things are being managed badly?

@_date: 2013-05-15 17:50:45
In reality though, the whole BTC price can fluctuate by way more than 10% per day and if you're in it for the long haul (i.e. you believe BTC is going to take over the world) 10% isn't that big a deal for the ease and convenience they are offering.
Bear in mind on Coinlab for instance, you have to wait 6 days sometimes for a transaction to go through and often have no godamn clue what price BTC is going to be (I've seen it fluctuate by as much as 40% +/- )
TL;DR: 10% is reasonable for what you are offering.  It will no doubt put some customers off who haven't thought about market volatility so maybe you would do better bringing it down to 8-9% so it at least *sounds* more attractive.

You seem to be focused on the copyright issue side which, in my opinion, is a dying monetisation regime; it has been leveraged by a handful of parasitic cartels in the 'creative industry' who have been able to monopolise and exploit the creative energy of artists by virtue of them being the sole gatekeepers to a mass audience.
Why would bitcoin mean the end of crowd funding?  The Assurance Contract funding models employed by Kickstarter is as integral to cutting out the middle-men in the creative and technology industries as Bitcoin is to removing the gatekeepers and parasites in the money changing industry.
I would highly recommend you listen to some of Neil Gaiman's thoughts on this issue.  
[Neil Gaiman on Copyright](
[Neil Gaiman - Make Good Art](
True artists don't do what they do for the money, they do it because their heart needs to speak to the world.  And good consumers will always be prepared to compensate artists for work that has touched them.  Those that argue otherwise or try to paywall their work to only those prepared to pay for it, should question their motives for getting into the creative industry in the first place.  
  Those journalists that produce quality work will indeed be better off under bitcoin, for they can be compensated by the crowd in many micropayments, thus removing the need for advertisers and massive media outlets to compromise their output.  Those journalists and artists that complain about this brave new world are no different to the luddites of the 1800s.  And they probably fear for their job for a reason (they don't make good art).    
Don't give into fear, just make good art, and the rest will follow.
- Interesting Fact: There would be no Shakespeare if copyright had existed in the 1600s

Nowadays it's nigh on impossible for small businesses to get loans on good terms.  Back before the 2008 crash they had things easier and could go to a bank and get a loan from some guy running the Business loan section, a guy who would have a very thin understanding over whether an individuals idea would be profitable.  They offer very little in terms of advice, strategy or networking contacts.
Contrast that to Angel investors and VCs who have a vested interest to look deeply into your business plan, offer expert guidance and opinion as well as cash and oodles of time, and it becomes clear why VCs are the preferred route to take for many small businesses and entrepreneurs.

Well I had an interesting thought on how it would be possible to establish a trust network.  In theory we could hook into ebay's well established network of users...
Let's say we have a central site for making bitcoin trades (with paypal even).
A user signs up, links their ebay account to their bitcoin trading profile, (we have a bot that sends them a message on ebay) to confirm they are indeed the true owner of the ebay account, then we crawl ebay feedback ratings for each new user.
We'd also need to crawl their ebay trading history to get an idea of the kind of money that has been thru each ebay account so that we can assign them a 'monetary trust' level.
Absolutely doable and would even mean users can start using paypal

Who is accountable?  It's not a who, it's a what.  Mathematics.  
It has *always* been about maths.  The advent of calculators - obviated the need for money counters to rely on the abacus or mental arithmetic.  Computers replaced calculators and introduced automated algorithms that obviated the need for money counters.
But always in that chain we needed guardians to be accountable, to keep the books in check, to oversee centralised computer systems.  But ultimately those people are only there as middlemen to facilitate the flow of the exchange of goods and services of ordinary people.  We forget that.
And now, a set of mathematical algorithms - embodied in the decentralised system we call bitcoin - has evolved that takes things a step further; to the point where the system itself no longer needs watchmen to keep accounts - obviating the need for a trusted 3rd party completely.
There is a great example in Greece where a local computerised currency was devised in 2012 that shows how this is working in a real world environment.  Called TEM , it allows people to exchange goods and services without being subject to the whims of central banks.  [More info here](

How does it compare?  They are both the same thing - the closely guarded abacus in digital form; an arbitrary human abstraction to represent the concept of independent wealth and value.  
Prior to the 80s and the introduction of digitalised computer ledgers, we used sheets of paper for writing down the same virtual numbers in hefty books.  And before that our ancestors made notches in sticks - called tally sticks - to calculate the same thing.  
Those notches on the tally sticks are no different to the notches of magnetised data bits sat on a harddrive somewhere that dicate what 'monetary' value you have in this world.

PayPal Chief Executive John Donahoe said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. “It’s a new disruptive technology, so, yeah, we’re looking at Bitcoin closely,” Donahoe said. “There may be ways to enable it inside PayPal.”
I am guessing John Donahoe has studied introductory economics on Wikipedia, he may have even progressed to advanced economics whilst he was at Stanford. 
Chamath Palihapitiya, the founder and managing partner of the venture firm Social Capital Partnership and former facebook Executive owns bitcoins in his hedge fund and in his private account, and thinks the digital currency will eventually evolve into a mainstream payment tool.
"Bitcoin and things like it are the equivalent of taking the red pill. We are entering an uncharted world right now," Palihapitiya said Monday at the conference. "It's a huge, huge, huge deal."

Well that's just human nature aka greed.
People should just use some commonsense.  If you want to save some money and speculate on prices then you can do that by leaving some savings in your BTC account. 
Name your 2 wallets: a) Savings Account, and b) Current Account

I think it could be linked directly to wealth.  Imagine a company setting up.  At first companies would decide to opt-in to the karma scheme just as they do for things like FairTrade etc.  They would be saying to their customers 'we are committed to ethical practices'.  Those companies would have further incentive to provide good customer service and act with responsibility (as negative reviews would negatively affect their karma and bitcoin balance).
Each company and individual involved in the scheme would elect to pay a small 'karma tax' each month which would be pooled, and then redistributed amongst participating individuals and companies when Karma scores are evaluated at the end of each month.  
Ultimately you would get to a point where a company not on the 'Karma Index' would appear to be circumspect and customers would elect not to do business with them.  
It could also be split across different industries: freelancer index, green energy, mobile phones, games companies (obviously EA would lose every year).
Even artists, such as bands and comedians could utilise this system.  If you go to a great gig, award them Karma on the way out and they will see their balance go up. 
This could also be extended to authors and journalists who could include a Karma QR code in their books / publications.
The incentive would be for people to do good and reap the rewards based on the crowd recognising the value they bring to society.
@_date: 2013-04-21 11:13:33
Hahahaha flipping the bird *has* to be the anti-karma gesture :)


I remember people saying the same thing about mobile phones.
I dunno, I envisage a far more freer world where we are all recording every minute of the day to some great server in the cloud.  Take glass a step further and imagine we all have contact lenses recording our 'lifestream' from birth to death.  People will elect to do this simply so they can relive past memories when they are older.  Wouldn't you like to go back to when your were 10,15 years old and experience what you did then?
Ultimately this would allow for crowd policing.  It would be far more difficult (or even impossible) to commit rape or murder if you know your victim is going to be recording your every action.  No longer would judgements be left to fallible human judges, rather the crowd would decide on guilt via recorded, incorruptible video evidence.  Similarly, punishments would be decided by the crowd.
Obviously you would still decide on what should be kept private unless there was a warrant to view certain timestamps because of an incident where you broke the law (which is not much different to CCTV footage being used against a person).
This would pervade every aspect of life, people would think twice before doing something they know may have ramifications were they found out.  Government officials making decisions on our behalf would truly be held accountable: instead of relying on sworn testimony, we would be able to go back to say, the exact conversations top bank execs had leading up to financial crash, and decide as a crowd whether the actions that were taken by those in charge were in the best interests of the public.
We are moving to a future where we elect to have less and less privacy for the perks being open gives us in return.  I think that old adage "if you have nothing to fear, you have nothing to hide" is relevant here.
And, in the very least we'd have millions of hours worth of embarrassing 'David Hasslehoff eating a cheeseburger off the floor' footage for youtube.

Lol yes!  As long as the dialogue continues in both directions, I guess the debate is healthy.  Let's strike this one up as a draw.
I have actually been shocked at the balanced coverage i've seen on Fox Business and Bloomberg in the last week, and for the willingness of participants open their minds and listen to people half their age.

Hmm, personally, I don't see the FUD


No evidence except for this excerpt from Gavin himself (linked to in the original post):
"Satoshi just felt the project was still too small to take that much attention. He didn’t want WikiLeaks to jump in at that point... I think people realized once I got invited to speak at the CIA that there was no kind of hiding. They, whoever “they” are, already knew about this project. Satoshi was obviously a lot more private, and more worried about what government would do than I am."
Incidentally, according to that New Yorker article, the very last email that Satoshi and Gavin exchanged was on the day before he announced the CIA involvement.  


The on the radar statement seems to be in relation to **public officials** who had just become aware of bitcoin after the press attention from Wikileaks and Silk Road.  Schuman's call for the closure of Silk Road was nothing to do with someone 'in the office' reading a paper on bitcoin - it was a direct consequence of the wikileaks/silk road exposure.

You're not wrong.  But equally imagine being in his position.  You were running this pretty niche, quiet little business since 2010.  Then all of a sudden in 2013 in the space of a few months you're in every godamn news site on the web and having to deal with multiple DDoS attacks and deal with 2000% increase in customers...
Whatever you think about their lack of professionalism (justified) you have to have some empathy for the ridiculous pressure they've been under these past few months.  IMO the MAIN thing is they've kept everyones shit secure and facilitated transactions during all this craziness when most businesses would have collapsed under this pressure.  In these circumstances forgetting about some bullshit regulatory paperwork you signed in 2011 is forgivable.
For me, I'm fuckin' proud of Mark and everyone at Gox for showing that a bunch of geeks who aren't backed by powerful VC's can hold their shit together during an insane growth period that NO business would cope with under normal circumstances.  
**The most important thing** that everyone forgets: Your shit has been secure at Gox, they haven't (since the very early days) been hacked and trades have been conducted with professionalism and due diligence.

You could describe the internet, TOR (designed by the US Navy), Mobile Phones, Skype, PGP, Dollar Bills, Pen and Paper in exactly the same terms; all of these tools can be used to encode messages and transfer wealth.  The challenge authorities face - as it has been for time immemorial - is not dictated by the medium or tool being used to facilitate the trade of illicit wares, it is in building sufficient surveillance  infrastructure for tracing the individuals that misuse those tools.
Not convinced?   Ask yourself why the Navy developed TOR and let it into the wild in the first place, despite knowing that it would be used to distribute porn links and other nefarious data.
*Tor was originally designed, implemented, and deployed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory... for the primary purpose of protecting government communications. Today, it is used every day for a wide variety of purposes by normal people, the military, journalists, law enforcement officers, activists, and many others.*
**They could just as easily add paedos, drug lords, gangbangers, facist regimes, drug addicts to that list...**
So, your question "What will the authorities think?"  My guess is their response is already something along the lines of, "Well it's nowhere near as dangerous as TOR and, indeed, the Internet itself.  Now, pass me those doughnuts"

@_date: 2013-05-10 21:55:16
I agree we do need to work on framing and messaging, and infrastructure, and security, and merchant adoption, and... the list is endless.
But mainstream adoption of bitcoin doesn't hang on a single word, any more than Obama's initial election campaign hinged on the word 'Change' (which could also be misconstrued depending on how you feel about change).
The key to adoption is in communicating effectively what can be done with bitcoin and why it is better than the current system.  The rest is just semantics.  
 
Just as in the 80s, it was very difficult to explain to people what computers could do without showing them... Then later, the internet... Now we have Grandmas using the internet as intuitively they do a TV remote.
The very best way to do all of this is to simply give them a real world demo and watch their jaws drop as their tiny minds are blown away.  Then the debate of real vs. virtual becomes moot IMO.

This is Already Possible!
There is actually a Google Chrome extension called Bitcoin Microformats
Here's the description:
This extension will detect embedded Bitcoin addresses in the page, showing a Bitcoin icon in the address bar. Click the coin to view the page's Bitcoin address.
Detects links and meta tags written in these styles:
&lt;a href="bitcoin:1NS17iag9jJgTHD1VXjvLCEnZuQ3rJEDGL"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;link rel="bitcoin" href="bitcoin:1NS17iag9jJgTHD1VXjvLCEnZuQ3rJEDGL" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="bitcoin" href=" /&gt;
Why link to a page, not embedding the address directly? 
Well, you can embed your address in every page of your site, a clean way of letting Bitcoin users know you accept Bitcoin, and if the address changes, you only need to change one file.
Also, in the future, I'd like to use it as a base for sending money, it's a pain typing and sending money to "113oN6A93WnAiK2iKD4BpVMQyDY4fbGEay", so why not just send money to "jonwaller.net", with the Bitcoin address being taken automatically from the web site.

Yeah, Cyrpus was massive.  The straw that broke the camels back I think. 
Whilst I was aware of bitcoin I hadn't been following the latest developments very closely but when I stumbled upon the amazing [Zhou Tonged]( solidarity video, I realised that bitcoin was the solution to the economic crisis.  As a programmer and freedom activist it wasn't hard to connect the dots...  
I think Cyprus sparked a global awakening that things had gone too far...
Without sounding too histrionic, I have to say the whole thing has been a massive awakening.  I've had tears in my eyes on more than one occasion when reading the details of what Satoshi did, and have at times been in a state of shock/denial that fuck BTC doesn't just offer hope, but a real, tangible solution that is not only doable, but is already in place and virtually unstoppable.  
Naturally, myself and many programmer friends were all-in from then on.

I have a theory...
Let's think about what we know about Satoshi so far:
1. Likely to be a Weeaboo
2. Hellbent on dealing out an insane level of butthurt to 'the man'
3. Creates a legion of followers multiplying butthurt ^ 8
4. Says 'my work here is done' and leaves without a trace
Now let's look how 4chan got started:
1. Started by a self-confessed Manga and Anime fan


2. Embracing the concept of user post Anonymity, Moot soon realized he had created a monster that could soon get out of control. And laughed with Glee


3. Leaves 4Chan users to wreak havoc, leading to Rick Rolling, Loclcats, Project Chanology, Anonymous


4. Entire time (from 2003 - 2008) attempts to remain anonymous until he is outed by WSG in 2008
Ladies and Gentleman I give to you... Moot (Christopher Poole), the evil twisted genius and creator of 4chan.

Yeah you're right in that if you sit down and try to understand what this does, you certainly don't have to be a techy to see how it's truly revolutionary.  
But the economics part aside, it's actually far more to do with how quickly and efficiently this can be deployed on the existing internet infrastructure, how that can fit alongside existing payment models used to keep websites afloat.
I mean the publishing industry are fucked right now, newspapers are in dire trouble because there's no easy way for users to send payments.  They've experimented with paywalls and all kinds of stuff, nothing works.  With BTC you could actually start compensating journalists directly for articles you liked (just like the tip system here on this subreddit).  You get rewarded for good content, you produce shit, you die.  Which is exactly what napster and now spotify did for music.  Artists used to be able to produce one or two hit singles, let the PR machine do the rest and produce a shit album.  No longer can you do that.
So, being in tech obviously gives you a head start in spotting how these openings can be exploited.
Once that starts resonating with businesses, it's a done deal.
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:22:54
Aware of the 2011 hack that's why I said:


Again, don't disagree with your other points.  Although I feel the coinlab contract was total bullshit, I have NO idea why he signed.  Maybe the guy really is bad at business but then, many geeks and hackers are.  
The point is, had BTC not just suddenly exploded Gox would just still be that super reliable site that everyone uses and never lets you down.
Then shit went crazy and they didn't scale well (neither did twitter when they exploded).  But there's a reason they're the no.1 used site, and that's 'cause they believed in BTC from day one.  Coinlab on the other hand, what the fuck do they even do?
We'd do well to remember that if BTC went back to $1 in a few months, Mt Gox would probably stick around, because they believe in this project.  Could you say the same for CoinLab and other VC backed enterprises that need to hit a profit margin?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:15:18
Important to remember dotcoms didn't crash because of a DDOS attack on the internet.  They crashed because people made very silly investment decisions based on their heart not their heads.  Mtgox can be fixed, over zealous backing of sub-prime internet start-ups because 'everyone else is doing it' cannot.

Good to see they addressed the insurance/licensing issues - piggybacking existing licence holders seems like a great way of solving these issues.
Whilst Jeff was a great and charismatic spokesperson for bitcoin, after reading some of his posts on TDV, it does seem to me he was primarily driven by idealogical rationale and I find it quite telling that, by his own admission, he only 'realised' the potential of bitcoin a few months back (at about the time he was approached by the ATM devs).  
I am comforted after having seen this presentation that they seem to be approaching the problems that remain with the patience and calm such a huge undertaking demands.  This is in stark contrast to Jeff who seemed to approach the whole thing like a bull in a china shop.  Whilst I admired his passion, promising too much too soon can often sound the death knell for projects when you end up not delivering.
Having said that, I do hope we haven't seen the last of Jeff - as comforting as calm can be, we still need crazy-manic every now and again ;)

As Andreas puts it: "What does all this being thrown at bitcoin lead to?  Well, possibly a bitcoin worth a lot less, but a technology that is worth a lot more."
I'm with Andreas when he says he hopes we get another 5 years of quietly changing the planet...  Whether we get that is entirely dependent on how quickly the old finance world decays and how much bitcoin is needed in its current form as a hedge against that instability.  
In the meantime there appear to be three 'camps':
Roger et al represent the far left, naive libertarian 'anarchist' view of the world and they're pretty harmless and sweet in spite of their bluster and foot stomping.  
Jeff et al represent a newly minted elite fully signed up to divide and conquer who have never let go of that old "greed is good" mantra.  They are patriarchs who think what they're doing is for the good of a humanity they look down upon, who they see as weak and powerless.
Then there's the neckbeards and old internet denizens like Andreas who have taken a younger generation under their wings...  Together they sit in the middle of all this, intent on ensuring all this will work for everyone on the planet and be used as a force of good in solving the many problems that disparity of wealth lead to...  We can only get there if it is free from any kind of control...    
They are the wise old tortoises who have been playing this game since Tim Berners-Lee gave the internet to the world patent-free.

If facebook implemented bitpay, users would be able to interact directly with ad offers from companies they like and purchase stuff instantly through facebook.  Facebook take 10-30% or more depending on product.  Think of it as an itunes app store but it's for everything and it's tailored directly to you and your tastes.  Stock prices go through the roof.  Remember FB tried to launch their own virtual currency but shelved it last year.

I think the whole point is that Satoshi was paranoid they would end up on the radar of someone like the C.I.A and was concerned this would jeopardise the project, as Gavin himself confirmed:


What is interesting therefore, is not that the project got picked up by the CIA, but that such a disruptive endeavour was allowed to continue without any form of governmental intervention.

Can we all forget about the price?  The people bailing now are those that weren't in bitcoin for the right reasons.  There is a 2 WEEK wait list for MtGox which means we have around 10 days to wait before those people who 'got it' from the amazing press blitz Charlie Shreem, Nicholas Colas and Jeff Berwick conducted this week, come onboard.  
In the meantime we've doubled our market cap, Max Keiser has promoted the hell out of Exante and the speculators have fucked off. Not to mention a ton of VC's getting onboard and 100s of merchants joining up.
The future is bright indeed.

Well they do care, it's just the tools they have are ineffective.  
Look at the crap EA got off their SimCity release.  They must have known that enforced DRM would create a massive backlash.  Were each of those disgruntled users able to directly affect their Karma balance, they would think twice about releasing a big piece of shit.
In effect, this forces companies into having a conscience.  
But getting back to the smaller picture: how this effects the little guy is what I'm really interested in.  If I am a great programmer and I go above and beyond for a client, being awarded in Karma as well as cash seems to me a very elegant solution to incentivising people to do good.

Yeah the porn stuff had negligible effect on the price IMO.  Even CNN wrote a balanced, fairly 'meh, whatever' article about it.  
Far greater effect (and missing from the list) was Jeff Berwick announcing that he was stepping down from BitCoin ATM which lead to people speculating whether the whole project was vaporware.  The price rebounded after the San Diego unveiling only for fucking Coinlab to screw it all up.  But alas, we shall prevail.

I think it's just indicative of the general lack of quality journalism we see nowadays.  The publishing industry are fooked and more quantity = more dollars whereas more quality no longer means much.  So if journalists are working to tighter deadlines and getting paid less, but still being expected to produce the same (and often more) work, coupled with them having to constantly compete in this instant-on-demand news culture we're now in, they're obviously gonna' cut corners.
Ironically, I think we're headed toward a world where bitcoin could actually help save the publishing industry.  I fully expect to see journalists rewarded by the crowd either via subscription based services and/or a sort of universal writers tip system where the best journalists are paid directly by readers.  
I'd love to see a wikipedia style news site appear in this fashion where each article is meticulously researched and sources are cited (where possible), that I could truly rely on to be unbiased and updated/corrected when new information on a story comes to light.

It's all down to when stars supernova.
 
Many of the elements necessary for life and its accessories, like carbon, oxygen, iron and gold, are produced in a thermonuclear frenzy during the final stages of a star's explosions, which then fling them into space to be incorporated into new stars, new planets, new creatures and new gold - which happens to be the scarcest of those elements created.  
If it were iron, then rich carbon based lifeforms would be bragging about their expensive shiny iron watches, looking down on their peasant brethren for only being able to afford crappy gold imitations.

I'm not sure about this.  Merchants using it in a bar or restaurant for instance, are going to opt for instant transfers and it is certainly feasible to do so (just as they do at EVR in New York).
6 confirmations is the standard to be secure that your transaction won't be "double spent." However, smaller transactions could be done comfortably with 0 confirmations (aka instantly). Due to the effort required to successfully double spend, it's not worth the attempt unless the money is substantial, especially for merchants or when you are sending to friends or family.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:19:36
Ultimately we're just talking about wire transfers so it's just a matter of providing account details and tying with a unique ID.  But, whoever gets there and solves the credit/debit card issue (as an additional means of payment) is going to dominate.  I have a few potential solutions for that involving posting out voucher codes tied to an sms PIN that needs to be activated to clear a pending balance (it would cut out fraud concerns since the card holder would need to be physically present at the card address)
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:56:16
Well yeah but the fact they haven't acted like they did with online gambling suggests to me they realise bitcoin CAN'T be controlled or shutdown, so they're now in damage limitation mode (keep nicely regulated exchanges like campbx and bitinstant on home turf so they can keep a close eye on them). 
But of course, they will NEVER have control of the bitcoin system like you suggest.  Just like the MPAA will never control BitTorrent, as much as they'd love to.

I remember when I first booted up Napster, saying to my friend "This has never been done before."  "Holy shit.  This is going to be a really big deal".   I remember telling him how MP3s would replace CDs within a decade, to which he shook his head and told me "Impossible, people are always going to want to hold a physical object".  But, sure enough, Napster was responsible for completely changing the way the music industry works and how we buy and consume content.  I remember getting the same rush when bittorrent came out, and was one of the first people to join the Effnet bittorrent IRC channel.  That was about 12 years ago, and bittorrent is still going strong.  It is this inate knowledge, coupled with 29 years of programming and tech business experience that tells me Bitcoin is something special.  
I don't need a degree in economics to know this, any more than I needed a degree in managing 360 record contracts to know that Napster would change everything.

Jeez, the CIA and FBI have known what a 'terrifying threat' to the status quo bitcoin represents since Gavin Andresen met up with them in 2011 and gave them a 30 minute presentation.  Yet, as the article points out, nothing was done (in spite of Schuman's protests).  Clearly people in the upper ranks see bitcoin as an inevitable and necessary immune response to the fucked up, corrupt monetary system we currently have.
So what's changed in the last few months?  Well, thanks to all the press, maybe now we're seeing some powerful lobbyists who have just realised what bitcoin is, shuffling out of the shadows.  In the same way we had douchbags on the RIAA coming out to kill Napster only to see it be replaced by Kazaa and then evolve into the unstoppable P2P force that is BitTorrent.
So, to any of the lobbyists reading this: Bitcoin maybe in beta - but don't mistake it for Napster, because it's rather more like BitTorrent on steroids.  So, save yourself the time and money and consult with your fellow lobbyists in the RIAA and MPAA and ask them how well their war on BitTorrent has been going lately.  
In short, give up now and observe that old adage: If you can't beat 'em. Join 'em.
As for bitcoin proponents lobbying?  I like to think we're rather above that kind of playground mentality.

You are forgetting that online gambling only became illegal under George W. Bush.  And it was an absolute draconian invasion of US rights.  I am just saying they could act with the same impunity to block bitcoin transfers if they so wished (they'd be more than justified.  Afterall, BTC ALLOWS circumvention of those very online gambling rules).  There is a reason there's been no action beyond some basic FinCEN guidelines and a wrist slapping of GoX.

Same with me (working 80hrs a week) I'm also middle class and fairly well off, though I've never saved, don't have any assets...Not for idealogical reasons: I just have a weird phobia of forms and have never gotten around to sorting that stuff out.
You are of course going to take advantage of the system and I have no problem with that, but the fact we take the system for granted (a system setup by falible, greedy humans) really needs to be analysed.
There are plenty of poor people who work 80 hours a week too, who can't manage their finances, can't pay medical bills, can't pay off loans, and find themselves becoming increasingly unemployed and homeless because the states monetary system is slowly crumbling to bits...
And what is the states solution to this mess? Quantitive easing, benefit cuts, 'taxing' the poor even more for having no money, and driving them further into debt.
You don't have to be into bitcoin for idealogical reasons, but I think it helps strengthen the core backbone of this emergent technology if you are.

Yeah you're right, even the like button concept started out as a Like app which they bought.

Like with the 17yr old Kid who made 18m just on Summly who got bought by Yahoo.
I think they'll use bitpay just as they use paypal when you want to pay for facebook apps.  We're not talking about a gimmicky plugin here, we're talking about a payment mechanism.

You are absolutely right, and that just goes to uphold my previous contention that if Bitcoin is to survive long-term, it needs widespread adoption.  We saw a similar explosive adoption pattern happen with Online Poker, only for it to be killed dead (in the States) by bureaucrats with nefarious agendas.  I can see those same forces of power working together to push toward a similar fate for bitcoin if we do not err on the side of caution.
I am very much of the "don't ask permission, just ask forgiveness" mindset.  Innovation goes nowhere if it concerns itself with the whims of gatekeepers intent on holding onto the more comfortable landscape of the status quo.  And, with that in mind, we are now very much at the stage where it would be prudent to seek forgiveness, and start building (instead of burning) bridges.

Only idiots bought into pets.com et al - it was a classic investor driven bubble fueled by non-techy speculators jumping on the latest bandwagon.  Some got lucky, others didn't.  
The dotcom bubble also lasted a great many years and made lots of people rich.  The savvy investors that knew the tech industry inside out did very well out of the boon.  And it is those same tech savvy investors today that are saying bitcoin is a 'huge, huge, huge deal'.
Still, I am not going to convince you and that's just fine we will agree to disagree.

Sure yeah but they are not ubiquitous, you would have to trek a long way in most towns to find one.  Though it will be great if they can do it too.  But I'm talking about getting independent shops and small chains everywhere giving cash back services on BTC, just like you can on a visa/mastercard.
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:02:38
Yeah it wouldn't really work for them, since they'd need consensus with the network for anyone to adopt any proposed changes, and they just would not get it if one of those proposals were that any one single entity should be allowed to manage (and by extension manipulate/govern) how the system is run.

Not necessarily, it's retail 101.  If I slash my markup by 50% and my consumer sales go up 1000% then I'm doing alright out of it.  It's why supermarkets will often advertise 'loss leaders', deliberately breaking even and often losing cash on particular items as a means to lure in new custom and steal business from competitors.  
There will be those retailers willing to hoard BTC, especially if you are seeing month on month returns (think of it as a reverse credit card :p )  They will convert just enough to sustain their business, but look at the rest as an investment.
If the risk/reward ratio becomes untenable, then worst case they've just built a sizeable customer base they couldn't otherwise reach which would likely lead to repeat custom (even if they were forced to normalise prices at a later date).

No, nothing should be censored.  I know you all mean well, but please get it into your heads that **NOONE IN HERE IS ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO LOSE MONEY SO THAT THEY THEMSELVES CAN GAIN**.

It encourages solidarity and it was actions like that in the early days that allowed bitcoin to reach the level it has now.
Please educate yourselves as to why the crashes have happened.  Please understand that noone anticipated the media frenzy that has accompanied this project for the last few weeks.

Yeah it's going to be fascinating to see.  I predict a ton of sells early on bringing the price down $20-30 as all the new buyers come in looking for the best deals and hold off making their initial big buys.  Then, as we move to afternoon, epic rise to $180 when the Ruskies get online.  Then rising to about $265 when we had it over to the yanks.

Whilst a govt. / corporation backed crypto currency could certainly leverage a huge marketing / PR push to encourage mainstream adoption, they are never going to get there in time.  There are just way too many legal issues and competing interests.  Just look at how long it took to get from Napster &gt; iTunes &gt; Spotify (14 years).  As with most things in business, it's the service that gets there first that will prosper (even if it has kinks).  Paypal is a good example of this - there were better online payment systems, but Paypal got there first and managed to get traction faster than the others and is now ubiquitous. 
I see the same happening with BitCoin.  As a developer who has only just started thinking seriously about what can be done with BitCoin, I am in a state of mild shock/euphoria about the endless possibilities running through my mind.  I literally drafted about 15 awesome start-up ideas yesterday based on BitCoin - it changes everything!
It feels like the dotcom boom all over again and I assume there are 10,000s of developers going through the same thought processes right now.  And that is something no govt./corporation backed marketing machine can match.

If expansion is viable, that's when Round 2 seed funding begins...Look at all the most successful tech startups, from Google to Facebook - Not a single one went to a bank for a loan (including the website you are on).  Reddits founders went to Y-Combinator, a VC backed seed accelerator for instance.  Go to a bank, you get money, that's about it.  Go to a VC, you get advice, a support network, other financial backers, contacts, and if it's deemed that a bank loan is the only way to fund further growth, a VC will even help you plug into that support network to find a loan at the best rates possible.
Like I say, a VC has a vested interest in making sure your business is a success, because the more money you make, the more money they make.  The same is not true of a bank, who see the same return on that loan whether your business is insanely profitable or merely trundles along making just enough to pay back the interest on the loan.

Lags definitely contributed to the panic-selling, but then I defy any site to protect itself from an 85Gh/s DDoS attack.  Even paypal died a few years ago under a similar attack.
But these lags didn't cause the drop.  It was caused by speculators and weak hands panic selling who were in bitcoin for all the wrong reasons i.e. "Look at all this press! I better jump on the bandwagon even though I have no idea what bitcoin is." followed by "Holy shit!  Bitcoin is pets.com!

As it was possible and desirable to build a better TCP/IP protocol without many of its inherent faults.  And yet, here we are using the internet...  


To be brutal, I don't really care what you think because nothing you have said has for one moment made me sit up and question my commitment to or belief that this project will be a success.  I don't know when you happened to learn about Bitcoin, but you are talking to someone who has been involved since 2009.  You suck up a lot of information in 4 years.
So why don't I care for your opinions?  Because you simply aren't knowledgeable enough on the subject.  It's like when I was a kid and my English teacher told me "Computer's are a passing fad".  I was 9 years old and head I.T monitor, I called him an idiot and got sent out of class.  Then there's the time Krugman came out in 1996 saying "The Internet will have no more impact on business than the fax machine".  I knew my teacher was wrong, I knew Krugman was wrong, I know you're wrong.  
People who are revered for being knowledgeable (often in a certain specialist subject) often dimiss others out of their own arrogance, especially the younger generations who have the audacity to doubt their wisdom.  And, especially, when an idea is ground-breaking or revolutionary.  
Krugman is a great example - he is supposedly the Don when it comes to economics and yet, he knows close to zero about technology and has been wrong so many times in his predictions it's laughable how much respect he still commands.  
Maybe, as a Computer Scientist myself, I am biased, but you would do well to look over [this paper]( which argues that the toolset that a CS develops is becoming increasingly important in solving not just computer related problems, but many of the problems society faces a whole.  They conclude:
"...the algorithmic lens used by computer scientists to understand computation can help one take a fresh and clarifying look at some of the basic questions with which humankind has struggled for millennia.  Studying computer science and learning about the algorithmic method is one of the best ways not to miss the bus for the future, and to join the club of the 21st century Renaissance men—the individuals who will play a key role in shaping our society in this millennium."
Of the many intelligent geekster CS friends I have who have taken the time to look extensively into Bitcoin, every one of them has come back believing it has some sort of a future.  Indeed, six of them or so have since invested a fair bit of money in Bitcoin.  And it is those people who I seek guidance from.
And if we're wrong?  Well then we'll do what all good Computer Scientists do when a program breaks - we'll debug it and re-compile.
**The question is: whose side would a seasoned gambler bet on – The Geeks who have already changed the world once in our lifetimes *or* The Men in Suits who told you the internet wouldn't be a big deal?**

Hive mind?
I don't see it.  Bitcointip is mainly used to reward people who have gone to some kind of extra-special effort to offer something of value to the community.  It's merely a way of expressing appreciation.
As for up/down voting, I would never downvote because someone disagrees with me.  For me I use that button as a means to deal with spammers and rude / nasty comments that have no place in the discussion.  
Upvoting, in the main, works well IMO.  The interesting and insightful posts float to the top.  Whether they are going to be biased towards the wider viewpoints of the community in question, well I guess that's inevitable when you split people into various specialist interest groups.
For instance if I go into as a Mac enthusiast I would not expect them to share my love of Macs and I would be prepared for my  Karma to take a hammering if I wander around shouting about how amazing macs are and trying to convert people.  The converse is true of course for PC users who happen upon However, that does not mean I cannot contribute to a useful discussion in if I'm prepared to leave my mac bias at the door.

The fact that you do not see why they are relevant and how they are related to bitcoin just goes to highlight how little you know about this subject.  So why don't you take your own advice and start doing some real research?


Here's a suggestion - If you really do care about opening your mind about this, and are not here simply to troll, then why don't you use Google? 
You will find plenty of resources from well-known economists, computer scientists, VCs, stock brokers, portfolio managers, and CEOs of well-known tech companies who have gone on record answering just that question, in just about every respectable news and tech journal you care to mention, from the New Yorker and Wall Street Journal to Tech Crunch and Wired.

Nice man :)  Like the way you've used an 'oldish' phone so that we're not pitching this as something out of reach to the average person.
I personally think we should stick to the Plan B ident as that's really catchy and clever.  Perhaps get the Bitcoin logo in on the phone screen, and maybe show a transaction in progress (highlighting how fast and efficient it is?) rather than a QR code which may mean nothing to the average viewer, and further alienates them.  I also think phrases like crypto currency may put off some people (sounds a bit uber techy and will go over the heads of normals).
The font I used for "Think of it as change" is 'Gabriella', which you can get from [Google Webfonts]( - looks a bit more funky and modern but still maintains the old Serif style.  
Final nitpick is that having the 'think of it as change' text aligned to the top isn't immediately obvious to the user who has to track her eyes from bottom left to top right (and the impact of the side by side comparison is lost).

The biggest problem we have is the system getting flooded with lots of tiny trades &lt; $1 in quick succession by bots trying to 'bid DDoS' the system.  This induces panic selling.  
The solution is so simple it's laughable: **you limit the minimum sell order to $10** and/or suspend trading when the system notices an abusive buy pattern so that this kind of attack isn't profitable anymore.  
There are lots more things that can be done to stop automated attacks like this, namely requiring a CAPTCHA code to place bids in much the same way that Google will prompt you for a CAPTCHA code when it detects a pattern of search requests coming from automated bots.
We're seeing teething problems but they are **incredibly simple to solve** from a programming perspective so in the long run **there is nothing to fear** - especially as more sophisticated exchanges come online and the risk of one going down is no longer something that would destabilise confidence in the whole underlying system (which is really just working perfectly). 
I am personally looking forward to [Coinsetter]( which just raised $500,000 in VC funding and will likely be built with many of these issues at the forefront of their minds (nothing like learning from past mistakes).

**Considering we saw a sustained sell-off the entire week leading up to the Coinlab action at a time when Bitcoin had nothing but positive press** (Paypal CEO coming out saying they were considering integrating, Techcrunch Disrupt CEO's saying Bitcoin was a "Huge, huge, huge" deal etc.) it is clear to anyone who watches the markets closely that **something strange was afoot**.
Employing Occam's razor, reinforced by Peter's statement that his **primary concern are his 'Alpha customers'** it is *not* conjecture to ascertain from this that the no.1 priority of Coinlab's strategy was protecting these 'Alphas' (and the Coinlab VC's) prior to the leak.  Ergo, we see market rigging and a classic 'Gordon Gecko' type flexing of muscles by an entity seeking to divide and conquer.
I, for one, don't want entities like this anywhere near bitcoin. **I'd much prefer a company that subscribes to the 'Don't be evil' philosophy**, run by a couple of well-meaning nerds sat on space hoppers and fluffing interviews over the damaging corporate bureaucracy embedded in a company that needs to see ROI for their investors.

Agreed but a problem arises when this happens.  Congress pass a bill that blocks money transfers to these exchanges (as we saw in online gambling).  When this happens merchants and individuals will bail since there will be no way of converting BTC to hard currency.  Even if they were to go underground, any merchants seen to be dealing in BTC would face legal sanctions since trade in BTC would essentially be under Prohibition.

I guess we could answer this with another question "What are the things that set bitcoin apart from other currencies that attracted you to it in the first place?"
None of bitcoin's core fundamentals have changed, only its relative USD/BTC value.  If you believe in the longterm value of everything a decentralised currency entails, then you are no better or worse off than you were 2 weeks ago when your 'investment' was seeing double its return. 
In short, whether you buy low or buy high - it doesn't matter if you are in it for the long haul and recognise that the infrastructure problems will eventually be ironed out and that, with time, you will be rewarded for your patience.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:43:02
That's cool, 'cause you clearly have a computer and in the future you will likely be using the shopkeepers 'smart till' to make your purchase.  Or you could just use a bitcoin ATM ;)  Failing that, ask a friend if you can use their phone?

*In short, whether you buy low or buy high - it doesn't matter if you are in it for the long haul and recognise that the infrastructure problems will eventually be ironed out and that, with time, you will be rewarded for your patience.*
You are absolutely right.  Until we sort our shit out and get the infrastructure problems fixed then yes, it's going to be volatile.  No-one is denying that and it's nothing to be ashamed about.  
However, if you've bought bitcoin as a store of value, then relax because you've just bought into the best performing currency in the world and all historical indicators suggest if you hold onto it for 3 months it will probably *at least* double in value... If not and you've bought it to transact then if you buy low *or* high, it doesn't preclude you from using it for transactions since those same historical indicators suggest it will even out over time (some days you lose, some days you win).  
And if you just need to use bitcoin right now?  No problem, the fact the price is $100 today and $120 yesterday makes no difference - it doesn't stop you from quickly converting your fiat &gt; BTC &gt; 1oz of hashish on Silkroad within 2 minutes of your BTC conversion, or $100 worth of [cupcakes]( if you are so inclined.  
My advice to EVERYONE who has talked to me about bitcoin is this "it's an experiment, we don't know where it's going, you could lose all of your money or you could make 1000x your investment but neither of those things are going to happen overnight.  And in the meantime, it's a fucking awesome way to transfer money without incurring fees".  So things are volatile right now?  Big deal, so was Paypal and Amazon at the beginning.  So were stocks in postal service companies after emails became ubiquitous.  So put on your your big boy pants for bitcoin.  Not prepared to do that?  Well fine, the average bitcoiner would discourage those types of people from getting involved anyway.   


Challenge Accepted!  I talked to my Mother the other day about when Cash and Credit Cards were first introduced in the 70s.  She told me about how her parents were against he idea of taking money that "wasn't theirs" (Credit Cards) and how they were completely perplexed by the idea that money could be represented on a piece of plastic (Cash Cards).  To think there was a time when the average person wasn't in debt and you had to talk to a teller to get a bunch of notes backed by the gold standard!  
Eventually of course it became self-evident that money could be stored on a piece of plastic.  Just as, in 10 years time, it will become self-evident that we don't need a central trusted 3rd party to oversee financial transactions.
We will find the whole idea of centralised currency as laughable as kids do today that their parents once lived through an age where there were no cell phones - to think there was a time when there was no way to let a friend know you are running late or the meeting place has changed!
What older guys like you underestimate greenchaser... and forgive me if im wrong but I'm making the following assumptions: you're male, between 50-60, middle-class, you've worked hard most of your life, have a ton of books in your study, a nice family and pretty cool car on the driveway that you're quite proud of, you have some pretty sensible savings accounts but you haven't seen much return on them; You feel you're being squeezed in the current economic climate (which you are) and you are unsure who to blame.  You don't want to believe there could be another solution to your problems - because that sounds too easy - but at the same time you kinda' do want to believe it because everyone you looked up to for advice (the housing bubble will never burst - Krugman/Bernanke) has kinda pissed over all the things you once believed in...
...So what you underestimate is how powerful many people united in one goal can be.  The geeks don't have hate or vitriol, we didn't start bitcoin to get rich, we just want to make things better.  And instead of waiting for approval we just went along and did it (hell, we'll ask for forgiveness later).  Without sounding too histrionic: it is in a similar mindset that the US constitution was forged, civil rights were fought for, the league of nations founded...  At some point there is a small subset of people that shout enough is enough and that is enough to release the pressure valve...
And it is for those reasons there are 10,000+ geeks united around the world right now - with more  [money]( than you can believe - who have just dedicated a whole bunch of their resources to making sure that bitcoin (or something like it) succeeds.  It is *the* only logical solution to the insanity that has been wrought on this world through the corruption and greed of the few.
And it is for those reasons, that in 2-3 years, the price will stabilise (i.e. merchants everywhere will accept it, people everywhere will want to use) and the clever bods now working on the infrastructure problems (escrow, insurance, exchange, wallet security) will have fixed them.

Safest thing to do is create a paper wallet (as discussed in the question above).  Here's a [nice tutorial]( explaining that.
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:16:17
Coins and notes are means of representing a numerical value.   I fail to see how that number cannot be represented virtually and still conform to your definition.  
That number could be said to be 'simulating the appearance and utility' of a stack of coins piled up on your table.  Just as when you look at your bank balance and see $200 represented on an ATM it's easy to visualise that as four $50 notes stuffed into your wallet.

Eh?  You're making some pretty freakin wild assumptions there to suggest that bitcoin is the only place I have wealth stored.  For all you know I also bought a metric fucking ton of Apple and Amazon stocks in the 90s back when the average person failed to grasp the importance of MP3s and Online Shopping.  Of course, it was a risk back then, just as it's a risk now, but the potential payoff more than justifies the outlay (especially if you're only risking money you can afford to lose without jeopardising your childs welfare).

-Log into Zopa at 9.00am.
-Explain my business and unique requirement in plain English
-Pick from a basket of a myriad of small loan offers from peers
-Click accept and have a loan by 9.30am at better rates than a bank.
Contrast that with the process at a bank:
-Arrange appointment to see manager
-Fill in multiple application forms / submit accounts / profit and loss forecasts
-Attend lengthy interview
-Wait X weeks for decision
-Wait a further X weeks for money to clear
-Pay far more for the privilege of all of the above

But merchants are selling at a price that is moving with the deflation (or should be).  Bitpay makes it extremely easy to do this.
Further, you are buying at a point that is moving with deflation too.  So in essence if you manage your bitcoin wallets and buying habits well, you are getting exactly $1 of value for every $1 you spend.

They are called the early adopters (in this case the suit wearing yuppies who could afford $400 on a phone the size of a housebrick).  The 'ignorant losers' you are talking about were the general public en masse (probably some 98% of the population).  Which is the whole crux of this argument.  The key is in crossing the chasm (getting from early adopters to mass acceptance, and it is not always that easy).
It took 20 years for the 'Home Computer' to gain widespread adoption for instance, vs. 70 years for the 'Telephone' and 8 years for 'Smart Phones' (which still haven't reached critical mass).

I think of it more as a gigantic start-up accelerator, kind of like a huge YC-Combinator.  There was an article on TechCrunch discussing this I posted yesterday.  So right now we're at the early investor stage, where facebook was just after meeting Sean Parker.  We can sure it WILL go up in value, just as stocks for Apple and Google went up in value and stayed going up for as long as they built cool stuff.  It's risky non-the less, just as facebook was to begin with.
How far up for Bitcoin?  No-one can know, the only other thing even comparable to this is the internet itself, so I go back to my original analogy - right now we are all like Angels with Internet stocks...Then for Series B funding with a bunch of hardened VC's...  And then IPO :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:32:21
Forget the gold analogies, or the will they wont they regulate it.  Let's keep the answer to your questions simple: The real value bitcoin has is its decentralisation, the fact that I can send any amount of money anywhere in the world for close to zero fees, instantly and without the need for a trusted third party.  It has the same value that email has over the postal system.  That is it, end of discussion.  
You may not like this response OP and I am not trying to provoke a debate, but really these questions have been asked since 2009 and answered many, many times (probably like 100 in the last week alone).  
When there isn't the usual hype that we are seeing this week because of price hikes this subreddit is usually a quiet hive of fellow bitcoiners and early merchant adopters discussing the virtues of bitcoin; they have already been sold on the idea after having conducted months of research.  As a result, there are plenty of old topics you can sift through where your questions have been addressed eloquently and thoughtfully and in great detail.
As for whether a competing crypto coin backed by a big corporation might step in and steal bitcoins crown.  Well, (the big banks and indeed paypal) were present back in 2011 when Gavin gave his bitcoin presentation to the CIA so they have had plenty of time to move on this if they saw any value in doing so.  
Perhaps it's possible that they knew it wouldn't be tenable to compete with a truly open source solution.  Afterall, Canada's government-backed mintchip was very similar to bitcoin in concept, and it died a death pretty early on.
Again, for more on this debate, sift through some old posts...

Who said accepting bitcoins means you can ONLY accept bitcoins?  It's perfectly fine to accept both BTC and Credit Cards.
The up and down fluctuations are of of negligible risk to bitpay, they can very quickly dispense with them at exchanges if they choose, but all-in-all they are up around 300% on any BTC they chose to hold in the last 6 months for insurance.  They also raised $500,000 in VC funding last month, so clearly Tony Gallippi knows what he is doing.
As for whether merchants prefer bitcoins to credit cards? Well, you don't need to take my word for it, here's some real feedback from bitcoin merchants who are early adopters.

I also wonder whether we will see Google move in to acquire bitpay, then just roll out as a replacement of Google checkout.

Will leave it for the winner or avatarr to explain the solutions.  Thanks again avatarr

Let them try.
The tech giants who are of the 'Don't Be Evil' persuasion are *even* better at tech than they are, including many of those who are about to graduate to bitcoin millionaire/billionaire status.  Google's datacenters could PWN the bitcoin at the flick of a switch, as could Amazons. So I think fear of a malevolent entity trying to take over is unfounded.
If I'm wrong then hell yeah, let the cryptowars of the early-mid 21st century begin!  Sure as hell beats firing missiles.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:17:48
lol totally :)  And remember many of the people buying didn't have ANY money at all before they downloaded Bitcoin and started mining...  They are the rich ones keeping all of this afloat, there is no way any of the early ones are going to bail.  This is too big to bail! :)

Anyone figured the second cryptobin (is that part of the 1st hint)?  I'm still stuck at the zip stuff... :/
@_date: 2013-05-07 21:19:05
Soemone asked for full solution so here goes:
*  for the original cryptobin
* Solution to this is Victoria (name of the crater on mars, found by typing the 2.05, 5.50 coords into google).  This gives you a new cryptobin and a reference to the genesis block.
* Next using the hint 'nonce' you take the nonce value from the genesis block and use that to decrypt the second cryptobin here: 
* This gives you 5KdRziZrUvbTWQR2YTiVvMD1Q 6051p161
* The second part of the string is a new cryptobin address: 
* Then I ran the constellation through photoshop, created a negative image and saw that it was Leo
* Using the hint Male &amp; Female, the final passphrase used was "Leo &amp; Victoria"
* Then I forgot to transfer the money to another wallet and someone else snagged it (Doh) :)

@_date: 2013-05-05 08:10:02


I think that's the point OP is making - that in the early days it would have been relatively easy to perform a 51% attack, which is why Satoshi was so concerned.
However, we are now at a stage where bitcoin is the largest and most powerful distributed network in the world operating at &gt; 900 Terraflops.  This makes it many orders of magnitude more difficult to shutdown and strengthens that argument that the C.I.A had no interest in killing the project.

Well i'm stumped then!
Here's a hint on the constellation though - Run it through photoshop and invert the image, then it becomes obvious which it is.

Huh?  Paypal can't buy bitcoin.  They might be able to acquire some of the services around it (BitPay / MtGox) but they can't buy bitcoin itself.  That would be like Google saying, "ya know, this TCP/IP protocol works pretty good, I think we should buy it"

"Give Gavin The Key."
Gavin Andresen is the lead developer on Bitcoin.  He and Theymos (the sender of the msg) are one of the few people that have "Alert Keys' that allow the client to send out an alert message to all people on the network (incase of an emergency with the protocol).  It is I guess, an imagine convo between Theymos and Satoshi (the original holder of the key) before he mysteriously disappeared...

I'm not sure, but I think the emphasis should be on *most* people.  If you look to why visionaries like Einstein, Steve Jobs, the Wright Brothers, Bill Gates were successful it's because they saw value in the pursuit of something most people scoffed at or ridiculed.  These ideas generally end up being the most profitable for those early innovators because they require a huge leap of faith in getting off the ground in the first place.

I used to love sending WU to my mate in Romania.  I'd ensure the challenge question was always: "How shit is Western Union?" to which he would have to reply "Very, very shit.

Well you could describe them both as 'technology' if it makes you feel more comfortable.  The point is at the time people were told they were insane for investing in Amazon, and those that saw the long-term potential of such a radical concept were rewarded 10-fold for their patience and belief in an unproven idea.
There' a great, great article about this [here](

Hindsight is a beautiful thing.  Many ideas that become self-evident (such as the telephone, the idea that things heavier than air could achieve flight) can often take many decades before the majority of the population see it as rational and self-evident.

There is an issue of course with strangers awarding negative karma completely at random in social situations (such as pubs or clubs).  Perhaps in these situations a system could be devised whereby you can only award positive karma (and it comes off your own karma balance) in this kind of environment.

^ what he said
Also must consider we're running on freakin internet time here, everything is happening 1000x faster than anything we've ever seen before.  But I keep going back to this: EVERY CRASH has happened because of 3600second lag at mtgox.  If suddenly wall street went fuckin blind, and all traders could do was pick up a phone and shout buy or sell, guess what they're going to do.  
Economics doesn't apply here, .php and load balancing does, ergo this bubble shit is a misnomer touted by people who probably haven't even gone to the wiki page to see what bitcoin is, let alone actually USED it.
It's a scaling issue, pure and simple.

Sure, but they've not enabled that yet afaik?  In the meantime, this should prove an effective workaround.
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:44:39
Yeah, I get it.  I'm all for playing the system and using it against itself when it's warranted.  And all of the above is inevitable when you have the likes of Peter Vessenes and VC's like Andy Draper getting onboard.  
I guess like becoming the band Coldplay, there is a certain price you have to pay if you want mainstream success.  But it's all so predictable and depressing when you know this technology was founded on greater ideals that are the absolute antithesis to this kind of culture.  It feels like it's being sold out to a record label run by a bunch of profit-driven publishers who have no idea that Coldplay only exist because they just like making music.
I still love Coldplay, but I'd be lying if I said the day I was one of only a dozen people who had heard of them when they played Glastonbury festival for the first time wasn't a bit special.
TL;DR: I'm gonna' miss the old days!

Is it not?  Is a credit card not a 20th century manifestation of virtual coins and bills represented by a piece of plastic in your wallet?  Afterall, you could go into a bank at any time and exchange the tokens it represents for 'real' coins if you so desired.
And by that analysis are the 1s and 0s that have been transmuted to a more sophisticated piece of plastic (a smartphone) not simply an inevitable evolution of the ever-increasing virtualisation of tokens as a means of exchange?

Well the crowd is made up of 100,000s of INDIVIDUALS with different opinions.  This is not the same as Nazi Germany where everyone is indoctrinated to follow one ideology.

All of those sites have a huge, huge audience and *none* of them started out charging that much to post a job listing.
And still, to this day, there are sites like freelancers.net where you can post a job for free.
If you are trying to jumpstart a new biz in such a burgeoning market, IMO you should be prepared to operate at a loss (or at least breakeven) if you expect to make any longterm impact.

Yeah it's about 4 in 10 start-up investments that pay off.  It's risky but that's all part of the game.  You want to change the game, you gotta take risks.
But what it DOES prove without a doubt is that there is about to be a shitload of money coming into BTC.  
Edit: It's not just *some* rich people, it's the people in Silicon Valley, the same people that forged AirBnB, DropBox, Facebook and the site your are on right now.  You know Reddit started out at YCombinator?  And it was thanks to VC funding that it got to where it is today?

By all means tread carefully when picking words yes, but OP's blanket statement "Bitcoin is not virtual" is just patently wrong.  I think it important to acknowledge that (afterall OP did ask for a discussion).  
I am all for framing bitcoin in the best possible light, especially when you are talking to a broad cross-section of the public, but in the grand scheme of things the distinction between these two words isn't going to have much of an impact on bitcoins future.
