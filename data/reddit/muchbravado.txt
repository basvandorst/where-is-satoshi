This is totally not how it works.
Seriously OP, learn about the subject matter before you get all uppity.
The fed injects capital into the system by buying its own debt (i.e. Treasury bonds) back from the public, thereby increasing the total money supply in the system. It's not that banks just give out free money.
If what you're referring to is fractional reserve banking, I would remind you that nothing prevents fractional reserve setups in crypto -- it's simply a way of putting idle capital to work.
What I think you're against is quantitative easing, where the government artificially props up the prices of bonds, depresses interest rates, creates inflation, and forces investment capital into risk instruments (like stocks). This is what can ultimately devalue the dollar -- the big factors there are external demand, interest rates, attractiveness of domestic investment products, and inflation rates.

The downside: this looks like market manipulation from 1,000 feet away.
The upside: from the reversion, it seems like the market sees a clear fair value in BTC — which is a step forward in a sense!
