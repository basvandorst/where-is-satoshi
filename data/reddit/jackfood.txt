My foot... now almost feb and it is still $10000. Growth is slow.
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:34:48
People like the big owners dump, and people like the small owners keep holding. It will not drop to $0 as long as someone is holding it. It is funny last time everyone hoping to break $20000, now people just hoping to break $12000

Bitcoin is falling 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:06:16
Lol spam... soon if you wanna to sell, you notice there is alot of people soaking mempool
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:38
Hard lesson should be learnt from history.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:17:04
When you knew something was amiss at $1000, you should stop... sending money...
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:57:46
Bitcoin is not a money useless you use it. There is no physical evidence, only virtual. Now people are in their virtual world, storing the money in a bitcoin system (a system of numbers and codes), treat it like a bank and no one using it. When one day someone decided to use a great sum, you would hear pop pop pop. Great people, keep on storing in a virtual system. For bank, I can transaction and buy my food, for bitcoin, you should wait 3 days or more for your transaction to go through before you could get ur pizza.

Bitcoin dip and dip... good luck... because irrational people buy BCH. Haha.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:08:49
By then, probably takes few months for transaction to go through
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:30:37
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:34
Price finalized only at point of transaction? Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:24:24
Bet your life in it. If raise, live comfortably forever, if dip, you sleep at the bench.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:22:48
Next, bytecoin. Then, kilobytecoin

You only earn when you sell. Your value is always $0 when u invest.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:09:09
Just remember that if you don't sell it or cash out (unless you did), your real assets is always $0.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:40:20
Bitcoin cash is x4, so the bubble of cash is x4 big too....
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:27:23
Good news that It will not drop to $0 as news have reported some of them lost their bitcoin forever. So there will always be some $ within bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:51:27
Be grateful of what you have. Yes, if you would have buy in 2010, you could do alot now. But not forgetting perhaps if someone buys now, they may lost all their $ in 2019. If you don't buy, you have nothing to lose. If you buy, you are worry everyday for the price inflation. Remember, if someone earns alot, another one will lose alot too. It is balance in a way. The main purpose of bitcoin is for transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:52:01
When the price drops, and you want to sell it, and you are unable to.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:19:19
unregulated exchange with unregulated bitcoin, that is what bitcoin is all about - UNREGULATED. Soon your bitcoins may vanish in the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:31:29
Your doom day is near... hit $19000+ today... good luck
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:45:59
It is told from day one crypto will be unregulated. That's what the investment is all about, unregulated, with crazy people playing the game. When price rises, people saying other stupid for not investing, when price drop, people starts to complain why there are no rules here... I m not surprised that one day the exchanges will eat all ur bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:46:31
Everyone is running away from bitcoin because it is a target for hackers. You Can see price dips lo. People run to other cyprto
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:47:56
Don't assume they are stupid. While you are earning alot, they need to earn as well.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:13:26
Is it a bubble or not? If it is, you r doomed, if not, your bright future is coming.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:55:20
Why do you want to buy? Do you know what you are buying? If you don't know the technology resulted in long transaction time, then good luck to you.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:19:50
why do you buy bitcoin? Do you know the technology behind or just follow the suit?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:43:45
Transaction fees can make ur $5 gone
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:59:07
If everyone thinks like you, you may not be as fast as others
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:05:23
Welcome to bitcoin, transaction is long and lost.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:19:13
Buy it. If true love, stick together whichever.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:30:41
currency is about public confident. One RMB$1 not equal to USD$1. Same as bitcoin currency - confident.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:27:52
buy the dip... buy somemore...
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:12:02
no. nowhere is safe, use paper or hard wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:42:17
All the noob in bitcoin panicking... haha
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:38:51
Bitcoins price is by social demand and supply, and no one can forsee human's social interaction till 2020. And the one who write the article is also a human.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:14:33
Maybe Google deepmind AI created bitcoin, who knows.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:19:19
You never ever gonna spend then.... haha
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:57:24
Already crashed?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:23:54
You lost the value of usability, isn't it? You can't use unless you sell.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:05:20
Is bitcoin crashed or in great depression? It hits bellow $10000. Worried.
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:59:13
Btc circulating will shrink to a point that those invested forget or died, and no one knows the code, then where is the real money stored? In a virtual digital world. It is all virtual numbers and there is no physical $$, the real cash is being vacuumed into a digital space, and gone forever because the code is gone.
