I mean I don't understand how you can not realise that bitcoin is completely democratic.

I probably won't be hadhing since that will cosume system resources which could lead to lag.

@_date: 2013-04-12 15:32:42
What do you mean?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:46:26
That's what I meant. Just didn't want to confuse people with technicalities.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:37:08
It means rule of the people not the government or banks.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:32:18
You'd be surprised. Some are worth a lot of money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:37:28
Yes. I'm thinking of mongoDB since it's webscale.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:31:13
Nice to have you on board.

There is no risk to the buyer. Typically though the price realised on ebay is quite a bit over exchange rates. Probably due to losses from disputed paypal transactions.  I doubt that auction will end in a decent price.  Use a service like auctionstealer to bit at the last minute.

But it takes away power from the central banks who control the 2 party system. You realise that right?
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:20:10
I don't understand what you mean.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:37:35
I know you are a smartie who makess bitcoins on sealswithclubs. How have you handled this whole episode.  Serious question, be grateful if you answer seriously.  I suspect you are in troll mode but I thought I'd ask
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:52:51
Thanks. My intentions are noble. The webserver will always be patched and will be behind cloudfront , I intend to hire a cisco certified network professional to ensure security.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:48:38
ok.  i just thought you may have sold out at some point.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:09:09
If we just store the iou's on the blockchain then they have to honour them.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:22:09
Ah that's good to hear.  
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:19:07
No , be short about 40k I think.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:16:14
That's good to hear. Shame I have to dip into the bitcoins to pay off the illegal fiat debt and lose bitcoins.  
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:52:19
Well you haven't seen the youtube video which explain all about the fractional reserve system and how the federal reserve is a private corporation.  Do some research on youtube please.
@_date: 2013-04-15 09:32:24
I know  where you are coming from so I think I do.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:50:12
Thanks so much for the support.  What does /s mean?
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:26:39
I think it's gonna be ok . bitcoin is back up to 230 by july i was told .  just hold tight.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:43:27
In the database.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:54:48
I am prepared to accept you as a business partner if you have money to invest.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:43:17
you are not really smart selling on ebay since the risk of paypal disputes will side with the buyer.
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:32:41
Buy buy bye
