Looking across the major p2p bitcoin lending platforms, I get the impression that they are getting far more restrictive and the quality of the loans is improving a lot. 
What do you guys think? I linked to one loan I invested in as an example.

Agreed. Just thought I'd point it out in case someone thought this was super accurate.

Not true, the loans are mostly denominated in USD so the value of repayments remains the same, regardless of the price of bitcoin.

A few things. Please check out Smartbicoininvestment, PeersocialLending, LendingMemo and LendAcademy. Here you will see real people investing real money or bitcoin in peer to peer platforms and making healthy returns. 
Secondly, on bitcoin lending platforms the loans are denominated (mostly) in US dollars, so the value of bitcoin is completely irrelevant. The fact that you don't know this, despite it being the industry standards since the end of 2014, signals to me that you are not well placed to make sweeping generalisations about the industry.

hahahah now you're just trolling. Those listed by me are independent investors who are recording their investments, profits and losses on their own websites for their own audiences. 
They are independent and in this discussion we are now getting to the point of ridiculousness. The arguments you are making remind me of someone denying climate change because people who sell solar panels believe in it. 
Please provide some facts to back up your arguments in the future and have a nice day.

Bitbond has been around since 2013 and has been covered in LendAcademy, Forbes, Handelsblatt and American Banker. It is definitely a trustworthy site, but it is simply a p2p lending platform, so you are responsible for your investments and you carry the risk. Bitbond currently has ~40,000 members and originated ~$700,000 in total loan volume, primarily to small businesses. I recommend you try it out and invest a small amount. You can start with the btc equivalent of around $4 to get a feel for the platform and see if you like it. Whether it is profitable or not depends on your investment strategy. Bitbond has created a ton of content to help you with this. Check them out on Youtube, the blogs, the guest posts, the podcasts or the newsletter where they send you tips on how to set up a good investment strategy.

The yield is per year. In terms of interest, chances are your credit card charges higher interest per year than that. Further, you might want to check out real interest rates around the world. In Brazil its 23% for example. As a small business owner in one of these higher interest countries, 13% is a much cheaper alternative. That is why platforms like Bitbond, BTCPop etc continue to grow.

It's hard to believe but the vast majority of investors really couldnt care about the price of bitcoin. They want an international fixed income asset class which will allow them to diversify their portfolio globally, and make double digit returns. Bitcoin, and the blockchain are simply a way for them to achieve this. Investors who want to play the FX game are better of trading instead. This is about sustainable global peer to peer lending.

There is really no basis in what you say. Peer to peer lending platforms originate billions every quarter. Using bitcoin as a payment network platforms like Bitbond open the possibilies of p2p lending to the global community, which as a whole, cant access Lending Club or Prosper. Bitbond is a good service and I would recommend you start small and try it out.

On what level are these junk loans? The default rate on these platforms is still relatively high, but the vast majority of loans are repaid. In the case of Bitbond, it's not even PayDay loans or the like, but small business loans to entrepreneurs around the world.

1.) My point is that bitcoin p2p lending sites can grow massively, even if everyone interested in bitcoin stays away. Most people really dont care about bitcoin and if they have money to invest, they want to see it grow at above average levels. For them, bitcoin is simply a way to diversify internationally and make above average returns. They couldn't care less about what they might earn (or lose) if they speculate on the bitcoin price 6 months down the line.
2.) This isn't even an argument. Check out all p2p lending websites which operate across (more than one) fiat currencies. Cant find any? Cause there aren't any! Bitcoin is the only way to do it. Stop trolling. 
3.) The vast majority of loans on traditional p2p lending sites are funded through institutional investors, meaning they allocate millions at a time. Again, the fact that you don't seem to know even the most rudimentary information on the state of p2p lending today, precludes you from adding value to this conversation. 
4.) Stop trolling and have a nice day.

Lending Club alone originated over $3 billion in loans in the last quarter. The idea that this industry is in rapid decline is quite funny. Bitcoin lending is in a more precarious position, simply because of its lack of precedent, but the value proposition is clear. As a result, many think it will succeed, me included. Luckily, fools have little money to begin with.
