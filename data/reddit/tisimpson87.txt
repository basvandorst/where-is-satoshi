Yeah it definetly needed some work. The women who lived there was a hoarder. I cleaned it out and it's super sweet now I lived there for 5 years. I actually have a tenant in it now need money for med school tuition. I will post some updated remodel photos when I have time/not on mobile

I appreciate the arguement for coins other than Bitcoin and I definetly have my head wrapped around the tech. No needed for F bombs and such. Definetly understand why you think some alt coins suck though. I have an 1060 SLi config mining ether for fun right now

Ahhh gotcha. Thanks for typing that out! Makes sense.
Edit: though the market is low somebody might get lucky and buy 120,000 worth of Bitcoin at 13,400  and then by the time they buy house it could be over 15,000 mark again, but I still see your point

Hahah yeah still responded anyway

Dude it's a risk for me. My whole life savings would be in the most volatile currency ever conceived by man. How can you take such a strong counter to that

Nah waiting till April 1st to list traditionally. Just would sell it now for Bitcoin. I'm sure crypto holders aren't your typical snobby asshole (right?)

Just curious what is your logic/reasoning. Is the house good or bad in your opinion?

Lol it had a hottub on an awesome deck but the lady before me drilled a hole in it and rigged up a koi [sic] fish pond. Was a bitch to get out and re "seal" the woodwork. I freakin love hottubs on decks.

My moms a realtor and basically forced me to wait till April to sell so I guess yeah winter is bearish for homebuyers. Would never have guessed myself

I read this like three times. I scored a 505 on the MCAT so not an idiot but I can extrapolate two meanings from what you wrote. Please explain.

That's why I was selling it for 120,000 to counter that and to cover any risk which everyone can agree there most definetly is. I would sell it this way for the most American reason of all: Profit
