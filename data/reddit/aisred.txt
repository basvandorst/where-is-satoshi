Coinbase (on Blochain app) listing 1 BTC = 893 TRILLION GBP, they might have a problem there.... or i've just seen into 2217.

14,180 on GDAX... 300+BTC...CHOMP
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:08:10
What apps or sites do you recommend for viewing the futures trading?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:09:05
10,200 gbp on GDAX now... what is going on, price is skyrocketing, sell walls devoured in seconds?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:16:37
yes, service resumed here too, wasn't out for long thankfully
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:35:23
was that during the Bcash shenanigans? Or maybe just economy level fees bc sender wasn't fussed about times?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:03:26
Yeah, mental to watch... wall was more like 400 BTC actually!
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:15:30
Hah, yeah... click bait ;)
Jeez where's your sense of humour downvoters! It wasn't REALLY meant as click bait.

First time I watched that sort of nonsense on GDAX live... chomp chomp chomp. Crazy!

Sent btc from Lykke app to my Trezor, appeared instantly, confirmed about 3 mins later. Was this Segwit perhaps?
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:02:50
I'm upvoting this. This is where the rubber meets the road... bc transactions are what's real. Currency is merely the potential to make a transaction. A transaction is the thing everyone really means when they use the word 'tangible', and all that is is a transfer of information. What you use to facilitate the transaction is in principle immaterial so long as it meets the criteria for facilitation.

Every XBT list item just says zero... where are you seeing the GXBT rate?
EDIT: Ah I can see GXBT on this page:

I've only had problems with Coinbase/Blockchain app... seems fishy to me. Lykke tx have always been super speedy. Don't believe everything you read I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:37:28
But don't the losses on futures cancel the gains on btc?
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:22:00
It also broke the £5000 barrier... dipped back to £4970 on GDAX

Transactions are not anonymous. Monero or similar for anonymity.

Isn't this a bad thing though? Mining is supposed to work through miner self-interest, not selflessness. We can't rely on miner compassion to secure bitcoin in the future.
I feel like BTC should be subjected to the *worst possible attack*... and survive it. That's the only way we can be sure it's truly robust.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:23:08
It's not anonymous. It's a public ledger. Even if it was this has nothing to do with the id you have to submit.

Interesting perspective, wish my eldest could find something to agree with you on re spending habits of a 20+ yr old, though it depends on what country you live in I suppose. If you've got 150k in savings investing as little as 5% in bitcoin would be pretty low risk wouldn't it? Don't trade, you'll regret it. Just buy and hold. Do dollar cost averaging to even out the volatility.

Yes, this fact alone is enough to convince me 2x project is evil. If there was any honesty in these people they'd name it btc2 or btc2x so it was clear to everyone.

how much of that have you converted to bitcoin, if you don't mind me asking? (well done BTW, that must have taken some discipline)
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:45:46
yeah, I didn't get to see the 6k either :( Bittrex high at $5960 too
