Who do you bank with that charges a fee for cashing in your coins!? I've been cashing in coins my entire life and not once have I ever been charged a single penny. I used to take in hundreds of dollars worth of pennies every few months, and not once was I charged a fee.

Tell that to me when your $100,000 mortgage payment is suddenly twice as "expensive" because you experienced wage deflation of 50%.
In an economy such as the US, where total mortgage debt alone is over $13 trillion, deflation can be devastating.

You speak as if inflation is a bad thing. Used properly, there are many situations where the creation of inflation is a great thing, and deflation is terrible. 
Imagine you take out a loan for $100,000. You also make $100,000 a year. Assume you pay $1,000 every month for your loan (1% of your annual income). Now imagine deflation takes hold in a society without the tools of monetary policy to create inflation. Prices within the economy deflate, even wages. You now make only $50,000 a year, and yet, your debt is still fixed at $100,000 with $1,000 monthly payments (2% of your annual income). You are now struggling to pay off your crippling fixed amount of debt. 
You also say it can be hard to tax. You know, if we are speaking of a global currency, there are benefits to society when taxes are collected and spent responsibly.
It's more complex than this, but these are some of the issues a currency must be able to address if it will be adopted as a global currency (or even a new national currency for that matter).
However, both examples require that government and monetary policy leaders are responsible in their decisions. We have seen over the decades uncountable examples of irresponsible spending, taxation, and money creation.

Debt plays an absolutely vital role in an economy. In and of itself, no, debt is not a bad idea; debt is a great idea. 
However, the type of debt, circumstances, and aggregate debt to GDP can certainly cause issues. 
Taking out $30,000 in debt to buy a fancy car you don't need: bad idea; bad debt. 
Taking out $30,000 in debt to finance an innovative business idea that could improve the lives of millions: great idea; great debt. 
I'm sorry if you didn't mean "all debt is bad and shouldn't exist", it seemed to be what you implied. Regardless, you did hit on an important issue, though: members of society (government, businesses, and individuals) have not been making wise choices when it comes to debt. 
To maintain or grow our standard of living, it would appear that members of society have been turning to debt at an alarming and unsustainable rate-- whether by choice or necessity (necessity as was likely your case when buying a new HVAC unit?). 
I think it's another issue entirely as to why members of our society are forced to turn to debt to maintain or grow our perceived standard of living, rather than finance it via savings. Among other factors, one could argue that improved economic productivity, automation, and globalization may be playing a role in areas of our economy. 
Don't get me wrong; I own bitcoins and think it's a great idea with great potential. I just don't think it would ever be practical as a one-world currency.

I'm sorry. I can honestly no longer tell if most of the posts/comments on this subreddit are from trolls or complete fucking morons. What the fuck is going on with this subreddit? It seems to be going downhill real fast. I seriously hope we are just being targeted by a bunch of trolls, and not that our community is truly filled with this many brain-dead idiots.

Yeah, fuck taxes! Right guys? Who needs silly things like roads, bridges, schools, or fucking NASA?! Oh yeah, and power lines. FUCK POWER LINES! These are just tools used to keep you all asleep, you sheeple!

LOL. Read your banks terms. You are talking mostly about ATM fees from using an ATM outside of your banks network. The fee in that image is because you withdrew from an ATM not run by your bank. 
When possible, never use an ATM not run by your bank if you wish to avoid those fees. 
I rarely use an ATM from another bank, but when I do, it's likely an emergency or something that requires quick access to my money. In cases like that, I am willing to pay a small one-time fee for the convenience of not having to drive all over to use my bank's ATM. 
That being said, I found Wells Fargo to be a joke. I switched to a new bank, but for different reasons.

You display a gross misunderstanding of how finance and economics work in real world markets.

Main part of my comment? No, the only thing I removed was my insult because I realized it added nothing to the discussion. 
I understand your argument quite well. I just think you're wrong.

Alright. I guess I'm being an asshole.
It's a good thing to hear different perspectives sometimes -- even if we don't agree with them. If all we hear is what we want to hear or only what we agree with, we play a dangerous game. These concerns are important to voice and discuss. I apologize for my drive-by criticism of your post.
