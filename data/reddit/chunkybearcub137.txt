It’s  not like cashing out is the only taxable event. Spending BTC or using it to buy anything, including other coins, are also taxable events

We need Segwit and LN regardless of whether “the market jumps up again”

Simplest explanation. Using bitcoin is like buying a drink at the bar. Lightning is like opening a tab at the bar. The difference is you don’t leave your card and either you or the bartender can close the tab at any time. Oh and as long as your tab is open you can go to any bar or any other store and buy anything as long as it’s for less than the amount you designated when opening your tab at the bar. Oh and your tab at the bar helps other people make purchases bc they route their purchases through you.

You owe capital gains tax when you "realize" your gains. You do so when you buy something just as equally as when you cash out.

I'd highly recommend Kucoin. It lists many new coins. The other benefit is that if you buy Kucoin shares, you get daily coins just for holding Kucoin shares. Kucoin returns 50% of its daily trading fees to its users, proportional to the amount of Kucoin shares they hold. It is kinda cool seeing random coins show up in your assets that you never would have bought. Also, if you use Kucoin shares to buy other coins (rather than say BTC or ETH), you get really good prices. I think this exchange is going to be big in the future.

Create a paper wallet for a small amount as a test. Once you feel comfortable with it, do the same for your gift

Probably a dumb question, but if I own bitcoin, ether, and litecoin, can I put all of them on a hardware wallet? Or are these hardware wallets only for bitcoin?
