Fantastic post.
If you look at it more mechanically, bitcoin has value because speculators predict that the price will go up in the future. Thus, they are willing to trade fiat currency for bitcoin.
This serves as a substitute for "backing," which in the old days referred to paper notes that were redeemable for a fixed amount of a commodity.
Because there is a liquid market to trade bitcoin for fiat money, it's completely possible to use bitcoin to actually *do transactions* for people who are not speculators.
This is a virtuous cycle. Over time the price will stabilize more and more. Futures will be disruptive at first but will eventually help this.
And that, folks, is how you bootstrap a new, decentralized currency. History in the making.
Nothing mysterious here. No "we all just choose to believe in it" crap. No bubble/ponzi scheme crap. The monetary theory behind bitcoin having value is super simple.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:34:05
If bitcoin replaces fiat, the price of bitcoin has to go up massively to compensate. You are calling that "catastrophic hyper-deflation," but I wouldn't call it catastrophic.
There is underlying economic theory to support this scenario, though it isn't guaranteed. And you haven't argued against it, except throwing out the word "catastrophic."
Right, you can't make a bubble that will grow forever and never burst, but what if bitcoin isn't a bubble?

Yeah, me too. And under that reading, it's completely logical that you can't deduct from 2018 taxes by making a payment in 2017. 2018 taxes are governed by the new tax law.
And that is logically compatible with my "shot in the dark" theory, too. The 2018 law probably says, in effect: you can no longer shift this particular activity, paying taxes, into the prior year's return, like you used to be able to (except up to $10,000).
So it makes sense that that one issue would "retroactively" affect your 2017 taxes but that you can avoid it if you go ahead and pay an estimated payment in 2017. Which means it's 2017 activity and fully governed by the rules for 2017 taxes which are the old rules that do give you the full deduction.

If only one nation is heavily using bitcoin as a currency, and bitcoin goes way up, that nation becomes very wealthy, because it has a much greater claim on the wealth of the entire world. Because they can trade their valuable bitcoins to other nations. That's all I'm saying. But it's just a rebuttal to a stupid side-issue. It doesn't matter.
Your whole narrative here is pointless because nobody is saying that bitcoin is going to be used as a functioning currency in any particular nation any time soon. Certain things could be priced in bitcoin and if bitcoin eventually stabilized, it could be used for more and more things. Bitcoin would have to stabilize before debt could be denominated in bitcoin. OK, fine---that fact does not somehow illegitimize bitcoin.

I feel like this thread has gotten confusing so let me state what I know.
If you pay estimated 2017 taxes prior to Jan 1, 2018 you can claim a state and local deduction (SALT) on federal taxes due April 15.
If you pay them after Jan 1, the deduction is capped at a much lower amount by the new bill.
That includes capital gains tax.
So there is absolutely a rationale for people with crypto profits, who want to sell around this time, to have gone ahead and done it this week instead of waiting until next week.
Selling now locks in their gains so they know how much to make on the estimated payment, and also puts extra USD into their bank account with which to make the estimated payment.
That said, not sure how many crypto people are planning ahead this carefully at this point.
And there is a countervailing factor: If you wait and take profit next week, you have an additional year before you have yo pay the tax man for those gains.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:17:37
Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme. Even if the value eventually collapses, that doesn't mean it was a pyramid scheme.
There is no such thing as intrinsic value. There are four potential sources of value for any currency: transfer of value; store of value; speculation; and being required to pay taxes.
Bitcoin's current price is almost 100% speculation based---the hypothesis being that it can transition being demanded for transfer and store of value in the future.
It already has *utility* for transfer of value in some niche cases. Don't confuse utility with "intrinsic value" which is not a valid concept.

It's always down to supply and demand. Enough people want to sell enough bitcoins now that they are willing to accept increasingly lower prices. The inverse happens when enough people want to buy.
In this particular case it's just market sentiment. There are lots of long-term bulls but people are fearful in the short term because the price went up so quickly and there have been so many uninformed/irrational speculators entering the wider digital currency space.
Once it goes down enough it will start going back up again.

I highly doubt I would be able to agree with this causality. Maybe you could point to a textbook to support your argument, and I could definitely point to a textbook saying the opposite. And none of our pointing would actually prove anything.
Now, maybe what you are saying is actually true, but that's a separate issue. We're not going to be able to establish that objectively on reddit.


That's a pretty loaded statement. You have not come close to providing evidence for this.
Again, I point to the entirely of the 18th, 19th and 20th century. Even IF the Great Depression was caused by the gold standard, the economy overall was up MASSIVELY. So the weight of evidence we've discussed at this point is in my favor. i.e. the evidence that gold is not disastrous.


This is way off topic (like most of what you are saying...).


It's fine to use "the gold standard" to describe the entire system, instead of the actual underlying fact of gold being used as currency. But the former does not advance your actual argument. But that's what you are now talking about. So it seems like you're arguing just to argue.

In the article you linked, they keep talking about "2018 taxes." In this case (and in common parlance, and in your usage in your post), does "2018 taxes" mean taxes for the calendar year 2017 (so the return is filed in April 2018), or does it mean taxes for the calendar year 2018 (so the return is filed in April 2019)?
Personally, I've always considered "2017 taxes" to refer to taxes on activity you do in the 2017 calendar year. So 2017 taxes would be the ones everyone is thinking about and 2018 taxes would be way on down the road.
I still trust my source on the issue of SALT deductions, but I see what you're saying there, so I don't know. I mean, people make mistakes.
This is a total shot in the dark theory but: I think it's possible that it's down to the nuance in the law. It may be that the specific way the SALT deductions were written into law created an exception so that only that one particular type of activity in year X---paying your taxes for year X-1---can be applied to the tax year X-1. You would want that exception to exist because it makes more sense that way (as you said). But then if a new law caps the deduction for tax year X (i.e. 2018), the new law inadvertently affects taxes for year X-1.


That's a good point. Thanks for the correction.

Because if the futures price of bitcoin is higher than the current spot price, you can make guaranteed free money (arbitrage) by buying bitcoin and holding it until the future expires.

That's an interesting comparison.
But at the time of any particular gold rush, gold was already widely distributed, which isn't true with bitcoin. So the supply was more liquid.
And there has always been an equilibrium between supply and demand for gold; you can always mine more gold if the price justifies it. So there is a real damper on upward movement of gold price.
Bitcoin actually has a huge damper on upward movement in that tens of millions of USD worth of bitcoin are mined every day, but that will be going away soon enough.
I think it's possible for the bitcoin price to go arbitrarily high arbitrarily quickly, once it's no longer mined in any significant quantity.
You don't actually need exponential adoption to drive exponential price growth. Sufficiently low liquid supply will also do it.

@_date: 2017-12-02 07:05:40
I think you are making great points.
I just really don't believe the value locked in bitcoin is 1/350th the value locked in currencies. That is my intuition.
Yet that is what the math shows, by market cap.
So what can explain the difference (besides me being wrong, which is of course a real possibility)?
1) Perhaps the fact that market cap is a really misleading figure. I suspect that if you were to slowly sell all the bitcoin and slowly sell all the rest of the world's currency, you would find that bitcoin's value "unwinds" much, much faster. So in a sense, the amount of wealth locked in bitcoin is not nearly as big as 1/350th, even if market cap is.
2) Perhaps I am over-estimating the amount of wealth locked in currencies. After all, currency *is* just a tool for making transactions. It's not how the wealth of society is *actually* stored---which is in buildings, factories, universities, power plants, etc. If you spend all of the world's currency buying stuff *even if that didn't drive down the price*, I guess you still wouldn't be able to buy all the stuff in the world by a huge margin. So in a sense, the amount of currency is just an arbitrary number.
In theory, I don't see why bitcoin couldn't, in the far future, have a per-unit valuation giving it a vastly higher market cap than the current market cap of all world currency. Because the supply and demand dynamics of a fixed-supply currency are vastly different from those of traditional currency.
Why are the supply and demand dynamics different? Partially because more can't be made, partially because the distribution mechanics are different, partially because a truly borderless global currency is inherently more useful (and in higher demand!) than a bunch of national currencies (well plus the Euro which is multinational but not international).


Actually the total value of all equities added up should scale with total global productiveness.
And the total value of all currency in the world should also scale with total global productiveness.
So if currency supply were to be held constant (it isn't now!), holding currency should be about as good an investment as holding a basket of all global equities.
If global productiveness goes up (more people and/or better technology and development), your investment in either case becomes more valuable in terms of material goods and services you can actually buy. And vice versa: if global population/development/technology goes down, you are poorer.
That is supposedly the danger of a deflationary currency like bitcoin: it supposedly dis-incentivizes people from investing in something that expands production (new tech, new factories, etc.).
Is that really true?
So let's imagine a far future where people can choose between holding bitcoin or normal investing. Well, if you want above-market return, you have to do normal investing; but that's quite risky, too. But the more people there are that flee from that risk, the easier it is for normal investing to outperform. (If you have 1,000 startups in a new tech area, it's super risky to invest in one; if you have only 2 because people are afraid to invest, you can get a fantastic risk/reward situation. Fewer people going for the lower-hanging fruit.) So it seems like there is a natural balance.
That's weird. How can that be? What's going on at a deeper level to explain this "natural balance"?
When someone chooses to invest held currency into something (say a new startup), it *concentrates* wealth in that startup. But it also imperceptibly increases the total amount of money circulating in the economy, which means that every other startup gets slightly less bang for its buck. So actual wealth (in material/human resource terms; not in currency) is being concentrated in one area, but total actual wealth is the same.
So in the end, the total amount of innovation in the economy (new investment) doesn't depend on how much currency is being held back or put into investment. It depends on how much excess stuff there is (material and mainly human capital) that is available to work on new innovation, vs. how much existing stuff is required to keep maintaining what is already there (i.e. support existing consumption).
To me, that suggests that the optimal economic situation for generating growth and innovation is actually one in which money is concentrated with the rich.
Because the poor spend a lot of money on consumer goods and services, which is just "maintaining what is already there." As they get more money, they just spend more. Whereas the rich spend a bit more than the average poor person on those kinds of things, maybe a small integer multiple, but then have a ton of wealth left over to concentrate on innovation. e.g. Bill Gates can probably spend 1000x as much on consumer goods and services as a poor person (including lambos and whatnot), but not more than that; all the rest is left to concentrate on improving technologies and otherwise creating new production.
By the way, this overall perspective suggests that currency is basically a claim giving you the right to concentrate *actual* wealth (material/human capital/etc.) at a later date, should you choose to do so. And that makes sense not just at the super-macro level I've been talking about, on a micro scale, too: When I buy a taco at the taco truck, I'm concentrating actual wealth in my stomach.
And it's claim on a fraction of the existing actual wealth in the world in proportion to the amount of the world's currency you hold. That's what currency is a claim *against.* So the market cap of global currency is like a nonsense, arbitrary number. It doesn't matter if it's $60 trillion or $1 trillion. But in the first case you need 60x as much of the currency units to have the same actual claim on wealth.

There is an infinite supply of currency in the world, because central banks can just create more whenever they want.
The figure you are quoting is just the market cap of all the currently available fiat money, not the entire supply.
Whereas with bitcoin, the entire supply is 21 million.
Of that 21 million, only a small percent will ever really be in circulation, because most of it will be held as an investment.
Bitcoin really is a different paradigm of money.
The idea that bitcoin is currently word 1/300th of the world money supply is just totally nuts, totally wrong.
Also, I found a 90T figure for total currency in the world, so I'm not even sure about your figures there (but in fact, nobody knows).

That is exactly backwards. Such a country would now be the richest country in the world.
You are complaining about something that is actually a positive feature.


That literally can't happen. If there were one global currency, its total market cap could only increase in proportion to the growth in world productivity. Because currency is only a future claim on actual goods and services.
I'm not making a prediction here that we will see bitcoin as a single global currency. I'm just responding to your preposterous hypothetical.


If bitcoin begins to see use as a real currency, they won't have to cash out. You will begin to see huge demand that isn't coming from speculation.
A lot of bitcoins are presumably held by people who didn't cash out at 30, 300, 600, or 6000, or even 12,000. Those people aren't going to cash out easily. And the more bitcoin goes up, the less they need to cash out to have a rich lifestyle. Bitcoin's value going up actually decreases cash-out pressure for large holders.

From the company's perspective, it's just another payment mechanism, like accepting credit cards or checks. No reason not to do it. There is no risk if you use a payment processor that converts to USD. In fact that is probably less expensive than accepting credit cards.
In a way, there's *less* risk, because customer payment info cannot be stolen, a la Target. This could be a big selling point to the higher-ups in the company that have to worry about that kind of thing.
The Target point can reassure them as to why customers would want to use bitcoin in the first place---i.e. reassure them that not all bitcoin users are loons, that there is a legitimate use case for them.

For all the people who are saying this will shatter the price due to merchants instantly converting BTC to fiat, it won't. If anything it decrease the supply of BTC on exchanges and help the price.
Because people have to buy BTC before they can spend BTC and have them converted into fiat. So there is zero net change.
If the merchant or the customer keeps some of the bitcoin, it's a net decrease in bitcoin supply out there on the exchanges, which is good for the price.
Also it's not true that people just holding bitcoin long-term may spend some of them without re-upping. Or more likely pre-upping. People holding bitcoin long term already have the BTC exposure risk they want. If they don't pre- or re-up they are just reducing their exposure, why would they randomly do that?
It used to be that it was sometimes hard for long-term holders to convert back to fiat, in which case the last paragraph did not really apply, but we are past those days of utterly shit shady exchanges and no merchants at all taking bitcoin except maybe for alpaca socks. Nowadays it's easy to achieve the exact exposure you want and people are not going to be randomly changing the exposure just because it's Black Friday.

MMM is a proven Ponzi scheme. The evidence may not be strong enough to reach the burden of proof necessary for a legal case (but it's more likely just legal corruption---come on, this is Russia). But the evidence is strong enough to prove objectively that it is a Ponzi scheme. In other words, there is a difference between legal buden of proof, and proof.

Right now $1,300,000 in BTC Is mined every day, and that is relatively low, since the price is low now. Overstock selling $1,600,000 is just not a big deal relative to that.
When you use the word "dumping," you are talking about people with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth spending a large fraction of it. Otherwise it's not "dumping." And since people can't spend that much money individually on Overstock and other bitcoin merchants, you can't spend bitcoins to dump them. You have to sell them on an exchange.
You could dump bitcoins to buy gold, for example. That would be a viable way to spend a large enough amount of bitcoins to count as "dumping" them. But to make an argument that people are dumping bitcoins to get gold, you'd have to show evidence.

The theory is not valid though. Say we define a significant early adopter as someone who has 10K USD or more worth of bitcoin (and many have way, way more). They are not going to suddenly spend 10K USD on amazon.com or anywhere else.
If you are a small holder with less than 10K USD worth, yes, you might be motivated to spend it on one of these merchants, but you could also cash out quite easily on an exchange.
So in other words there is no "middle class" of bitcoin holder who wants to convert to fiat but can't except through more merchants accepting bitcoin. This phenomenon doesn't exist.
The real issue driving down prices is that miners are producing a huge amount of USD-equivalent in new bitcoin every day and there has to be a matching amount of new money coming in and holding for the price to stay steady.
Given that, the fact that bitcoin is still over 400 USD indicates that there is still a huge amount of "big money" coming into bitcoin.
I can easily remember when bitcoin were $5 a pop and that felt like a lot.

That's not valid in general. If bitcoin had an upper limit of 2.1 million instead of 21 million, it would be more scarce, but it would not be more or (or less) preferable.
Actually this shows that "scarcity" as it applies to money is not a valid concept. Which is more scarce: gold, US dollars, or bitcoin?

Better yet, you redeem bitcoin at the merchant at any point (before or during checkout) and you get a positive account balance for the corresponding amount.
This is beneficial because you don't have to check out and send your bitcoins all at once. Makes it less complicated.
Moreover, conceptually, sending a merchant bitcoin is analogous to sending them money, and is not analogous to applying a coupon code.
Finally, it removes the need for a 3rd party wallet. e.g. you can get bitcoin out of changetip and send it directly to your favorite merchant where you know you'll eventually make a purchase. It's easier for newbies. And the merchants should appreciate this, because someone with a positive account balance is incentivized to come back (this is the same reason merchants are incentivized to sell gift cards).

I wouldn't try to look for a "perfect" solution. There is no such thing for institutions composed of human beings.

I agree completely that the dollar is based on proof-of-violence. If you don't pay your taxes in dollars, the government will use force to punish you. They have proven this time and again, which is why we all pay our taxes in dollars and the dollar has value.
However, the dollar is actually *backed* (not just "based") on proof-of violence. Whereas bitcoin is not *backed* at all. It is not backed by proof-of-work. So the analogy of proof-of-violence to proof-of-work is not perfect.

It's not reasonable to assume there is any valuable intellectual property. It's better to have diluted shares of something, than to have nothing at all. That is the choice that we can presume investors are facing, *if* the company actually needs a cash infusion.

As to the point about diluting existing investors: it doesn't matter whether the company is owned by 1 founder or 100 investors. Either way, they can raise money by selling equity. Yes, the investors have to agree, but the scenario is not fundamentally different from a sole proprietorship in this regard.
Since you are changing the topic and not making valid points, I think you are just motivated to badmouth Bitstamp for some reason. You seem to be trying to win an argument instead of have a rational discussion.

There is no plausible short-term path from where we are now, to bcash or segwit2x coins having a higher value than normal bitcoins. Which is what would be economically required for miners to permanently move away from normal bitcoin mining.
I was tempted to attribute the situation to a conspiracy, but after a lot of thinking, I can't see a plausible way it would work.
Here is my theory. I think segwit2x was originally a compromise between different camps. When it eventually became obvious the community wasn't enough in favor of segwit2x for it to become the new bitcoin, the participants decided to just go through with it anyway. Because it'll create a situation like bcash did where hodlers (including, presumably, miners) can dump fork coins for a big profit without really harming normal bitcoin.

Honestly, this is just totally wrong. In doing the math, you have to account for the **liquid supply** of bitcoin on the market or likely to come to market---not the **total supply**.
Probably the vast majority of bitcoin are just being held in cold wallets for a very long time. Compared to that, the amount of bitcoin actually "kicking around" in the ecosystem, and the remaining bitcoin to be mined, is pretty small. And it's going to keep getting smaller, and smaller, and smaller.
That's why the price is already almost 1/3 of $24,000 despite bitcoin being light-years away from having 1% of the world economy.
Bitcoin being used as a common functional currency even in one small-ish country would drive the price way, way over $24,000. There just isn't enough to go around.
I think people really fail to appreciate the math of supply and demand. What happens when there is high demand for something with a small, fixed quantity? In the limit, the price approaches infinity.
People think bitcoin requires exponential adoption in order to have exponential price growth, and that is completely wrong, for the reasons stated above. You can have exponential price growth even with a much smaller and linear rate of adoption, since the supply is constantly drying up.

I am betting strongly against that. Segwit2x tokens are currently trading at bitfinex at 12% the value of bitcoin. That means miners have to take an 88% loss for any mining they do on the Segwit2x chain. We should see miners abandon Segwit2x pretty quickly.
There is a $6,400 gap between segwit2x and bitcoin which has to be closed in order for segwit2x to "win," and I don't see any realistic scenario going forward in which that gap is closed.
Even if segwit2x "wins," bitcoin mining and trading will continue. Bitcoin literally cannot be stopped, at this point.
And exchanges are likely to face lots of problems if they market a different token as "bitcoin" under that circumstance.

There is no such thing as intrinsic value. It's a false concept.
What you're trying to say is just fine, I get it. You're making a good point.
But false concepts are dangerous. For instance, the idea that gold (or any commodity or money) have intrinsic value.
There is nothing backing gold, except the fact that people are willing to buy it at a high price, always have been, probably always will be, because they know they probably can sell it for a high price later to someone else down the line. And on and on it goes, across the years.
Sure, gold has some uses, but that doesn't account for the price.

My car is sitting in the driveway.


Correct. For instance, in the above statement, I'm assuming that my car hasn't been stolen. If I were really pressed (say by a judge in a court case), I'd have to be very careful. I'd say "My car is in the driveway, assuming it hasn't been stolen; it hasn't been hit by a meteorite; it' hasn't been dissolved by an alien's particle gun; and any number of extremely unlikely things that don't really bother me." That statement is always going to be true. Even if it turns out that we all are brains in vats and reality is simulated, it's still true, because I didn't say anything about that; it just means the car is simulated.


Yes you can, but you have to formulate math as an abstraction from concrete reality instead of doing it from a set of pre-assumed axioms. I mean I could sit here, not knowing math (e.g. as a primitive cave man), and invent first counting; then addition; then subtraction; then multiplication; then division; then fractions; then (eventually) algebra; then (eventually) calculus; etc. As long as you proceed correctly, you won't have contradictions. Because math comes from observing units in reality (e.g. if we have one sheep and one sheep, we can say we have two sheep...) and also from logic; and logic is ultimately merely the law of non-contradiction. Math literally can't contradict because you have to proceed using the law of non-contradiction at each step. Anyway, Plato said that math comes from "higher forms" in the "ideal world" of heaven---which is the exact opposite of my position and completely wrong---and most math professors and philosophers still believe some version of that, unfortunately.


I'm not wrong very often, because I qualify my statements. For instance, I'd say "if these three things are true, and there isn't some other factor I don't know about, X will happen."

This is incredibly preposterous. What you're saying is true, say, in Saudi Arabia, but in Western democracies there is a huge class of people who are in the $1,000,000 to $10,000,000 range just from working hard, having small businesses, being responsible. And there is a smaller class of real innovators and entrepreneurs who are far wealthier that are entirely self-made, like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, the late Steve Jobs, etc (I'm more of a tech guy but this exists across most industries). For every Bill Gates there are 1,000 multi-millionaires you haven't heard of. I would place a very high wager that most rich people in the U.S. do not have generational wealth.


That is a strange topic to bring up because most rich people are not billionaires.

That graphic is extremely misleading.
As of today, bitcoin has a feature called segwit. So you could call the bitcoin blockchain "the segwit chain" if you want to, which is what is happening in that graphic.
When the November fork happens, there is a new chain called "segwit2x."
If you have N bitcoin before the fork, you will have N bitcoin on each chain after the fork.
However, that only applies if the coins are in your custody. That is to say, you control the private keys that allow the bitcoins to be spent. If the coins are in an exchange, that means you don't control them. What you would get after a fork would be up to the exchange to decide. It could be N coins on each fork, or just N coins on one or the other of the forks.
The reason the misleading graphic exists is because the guy who runs bitcoin.com is pushing a different vision and agenda from the group of developers who produce the bitcoin software. I'd recommend bitcoin.org and the bitcoin wiki as better sources of information in the future.

It's becoming increasingly obvious that this is by far the most likely outcome.
And it's just not economically possible for miners to keep mining a really cheap coin (compared to bitcoin) for long.
So why are the miners forking it if everybody knows the facts? I've really been wondering.
Perhaps the simplest explanation is that it's free money. Just like BCH was free money.
Of course if the miners cause so much chaos that bitcoin's price tanks, they've shot the goose that lays the golden eggs.
But nobody is really expecting that. It looks like Segwit2x will end up just like BCH. So yay, free money for all.
Though I'm really not happy with it---I'd rather we be content with the money we have and not rock the boat so much.
There is another upside to all this. If and when Segwit2x fails, it will show that the miners cannot control bitcoin, which is a huge positive for bitcoin.
It sends a message to regulators and to any would-be dictators that bitcoin can't be corrupted. It's (ironically) particularly positive for the big Chinese miners, who otherwise could eventually face pressure from the Chinese Communist Party to make changes.

I feel that the Bitcoin Core group of developers represents users. And they make final decisions for the users. If users stop supporting that group, they can migrate to some other group of developers. This is basically how open source/free software projects work, in a political sense.
So I think that miners who upgrade without coming to a consensus with Core are taking a hostile action against all users.
Some miners argue that it's fine to "let the market decide." But this creates massive uncertainty and instability. It's much better that we all move forward as a community.
Some miners argue that the chain with the most proof of work is the "true bitcoin." But that's also wrong. The idea of going with the chain with the most work, is a way to achieve Byzantine consensus and a protection against 51% attacks, *not* a way to allow *any* long chain to become bitcoin. For instance, a longest-proof-of-work chain where the maximum bitcoin limit is not 21 million, would not be bitcoin.
Putting this all together: **No fork that occurs without widespread agreement among developers and the user community can claim to be "bitcoin." The consequence of this is that bitcoin is well-defined; nobody can just  arbitrarily claim the name "bitcoin" for their fork.**
I'd honestly be fine with Segwit2x (though extremely begrudgingly) if the user community were behind it... but we aren't. There is no consensus here.
In the unlikely event that there is a *truly contentious* fork, including Core splitting up and/or a serious challenger to Core arising that has a serious fraction of the community behind it---"bitcoin" will cease to exist. There will only be "bitcoin with this new feature" and "bitcoin without this new feature."
This is how language works, anyway. If we all agree on what the word "boat" means, a boat is a boat. If a lot of the population suddenly thinks a boat is some unrelated and newly-invented object, the word "boat" is lost to society because it's ambiguous, and we replace "boat" with some other word when we want to talk about the same thing.
To answer a likely objection: What if a "serious fraction" (say over 30% of users) wants to fork in a way that breaks the fundamental principles of bitcoin? Like, say, raise the coin limit over 21 million? I just don't think that will ever happen. You know the rules, and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of.

The vast majority of coins will be held long-term by investors. And that share will only increase over time.

If you are an American: You have to pay taxes on the income you make when you sell bitcoin.

Normally people would buy bitcoins at the "normal" market price and then sell in Zimbabwe. Repeat over and over until the Zimbabwe price is driven down to the normal price.
If that's not happening, either (a) nobody has bothered to do it, or (b) people can't withdraw fiat money from the Zimbabwe exchange efficiently (i.e. internationally, reliably, in large quantities).
Probably (b).

I don't think so, because the lightning hub business should be extremely competitive.

As far as I'm aware, Barry Silbert has mysteriously disappeared from social media since the end of September. Whereas he used to be really active, particularly during the time of the NYA.
As a result, segwit2x really feels like a movement with no leadership. It feels like a bunch of people with one foot over the line and one foot behind. Lots of the NYA people have actually taken a pretty neutral position at this point.
If Barry Silbert believes in segwit2x he should take adam back's offer to trade segwit2x coins for bitcoin at a really favorable ratio.

That's not the case. I mean, imagine a metal similar to gold but with a market value smaller than aluminum. Would it be desirable to have a large pile of it just sitting in a room in your house? No. So it's not intrinsically valuable. It's nice to look at, but only in small quantities (e.g. gold leaf, gold jewelry).
The entire concept of intrinsic value doesn't make sense. It means something is valuable "for no particular reason, just because." It comes originally from religion.


See---that doesn't mean anything.


The knowledge and critical thinking skills are not an intrinsic value, they are just actually valuable. They make you better to appreciate and enjoy life, better able to think, and possibly help you in your career. (Assuming it's a good school, which is a separate issue.)
You're not really wrong here, you're just using "intrinsic value" differently here than you were using it when you describe gold. When people say "gold has intrinsic value," they do *not* mean the same kind of value as when they say "a college education has intrinsic value."
That's why I'm saying it's a false concept. It leads to sloppy thinking. It's a weasel word.

Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks. It controls how hard it is for a new block to be discovered.
If blocks are found more quickly than desired, the difficult increases ("gets higher") so that the rate of block discovery will slow down.
If blocks are found more slowly than desired, the difficult decreases so that the rate of block discovery will speed up.
A chain with a higher difficulty means more mining power was expended on it during the last 2016 block period, than on a chain with lower difficulty.
What Coinbase is saying, is that they will pick the chain with the most mining power behind it.

Actually, the non-forked bitcoin network would have continued operating just fine.
Moreover, the exchanges had pretty much all committed to trading both regular bitcoins, and the forked coins. In the event of segwit2x failing to work properly, the price of regular bitcoins most likely would have held up just fine.
Of course the price of forked segwit2x coins would likely plummet from an already low starting position relative to bitcoin.

Normally I'd say getting a government job at taxpayer expense is even more illegitimate than getting a free degree at taxpayer expense. But it sounds like you may be doing some kind of police or emergency work, in which case, I'm very thankful for what you're doing.
By the way, I got my education for pretty cheap at a public university - but I've probably already more than paid it back in taxes. So the "free degree at taxpayer expense" thing doesn't really count against an individual who pays taxes. That said, the higher education system is an utterly ridiculous money toilet (not to mention mostly not providing useful education).
Also, if your job sucks that much, you can get a different job! You are definitely not "forced" to get up at 2AM to fix a machine. This is not Soviet Russia. Even if you could not get a different job, that doesn't equate to being "forced" to do anything. If I don't wear clothes in the winter, I will freeze to death; that does not mean I am "forced" to wear clothes.
Regarding collusion between CEOs and government - no, it's entirely the government's fault. A CEO who does not collude will be put out of business by the CEO that does collude.

Every time the maintainers update the sotware in a non-backwards-compatible way (as would happen if they changed the protocol so they could just make bitcoins), it "forks" the blockchain (the distributed ledger) into two blockchains. Everybody always has agreed with these updates, so everybody uses the "new" blockchain, and any updates to the "old" blockchain from the point of the fork are ignored by everybody.
If the maintainers were to do something controversial, lots of people would not switch to the new fork. The value of the "new" and "old" bitcoins would depend on how many people want to go with the new system, and how many want to go with the old.
As long as the updates (hence, forks) are for clearly beneficial reasons, everybody will always accept the new fork. If the new fork is clearly to the detriment of everyone except the maintainers, *nobody* will switch to it.
A case in the middle would be pretty bad for bitcoin, but would be very unlikely. Bitcoin isn't like politics. It's not driven by opinions or interest groups. In terms of protocol changes, it's the opposite of a zero sum game: we all win or we all lose, there is no point in *not* cooperating.

I think an interesting alternative approach is to say:
"Sometimes people need to store value. Bitcoin is a good way to do that. As long as there are other people who want to store value in bitcoins later, when you want to spend it, you can exchange your bitcoins with them. There is, literally, a *demand* for storing value, in the sense of supply vs. demand.
"Why is bitcoin a good way to store value? Becuase it's like gold, but much easier to acquire, transact, and store.
"Over time, it will increasingly become more widely adopted and used as a means of simply *exchanging* value, because, again, it's easier to transact with and store than traditional currencies, since it's electronic."

Debt is something you get into voluntarily. So it's not clear to me at all how being in debt is unfair. If you enter into something voluntarily and end up regretting it, you've just made a bad decision. And people have to be free to make decisions.
Actually, it's the leftists (maybe you're in this group - you have some of their ideas) that aren't helping Bitcoin. The reason Bitcoin is so great is because it does make certain unfair things fair. But those unfair things are things that are *not entered into voluntary.* Specifically, the massive government intervention into the money supply - which, as I think we agree, is not only unfair to individuals as such, but has massive economic consequences.

Intentionally excluding a particular race is racist in and of itself, but that's not what we were originally talking about.
The Nazis believed that there was "Jewish truth" and "German truth," and the "reality" created by the Germans was better. Not only is this racist; it's an attack on objectivity. Under this idea, there is no objective reality, and no objective truth.
Communists in Russia (and, later, the Soviet Union) had a similar idea. They believed there was "proletariat truth" and "bourgeois truth" which were mutually incompatible. The "bourgeois" had to be killed (usually) or re-educated (sometimes) because they had a different version of the truth. Again, no objective reality, no objective truth. This case is not "racist" but, it's even a word, "classist," and equally wrong.
You seemed to be potentially tending towards a similar mistake when you said that if certain regions are not represented, NPOV is violated. That's not necessarily the case, because it's not as if, say, people from Palestine, live in a different reality or have their own version of "truth," as opposed to people from Israel.
Let me go ahead and cover a likely objection. It may be that someone in a certain region has access to *more* information. For example, if a bomb hits town X, people in town X will know that, and people in town Y will not. But that does not have any affect on presenting a neutral point of view. If that information is not available, it's just less information that is publicly known.

LOL! Not publicly funded education?? The government is stealing lots of money from me to pay for YOUR education - and then charging you ridiculous amounts on top of that. The fact is, the free market works well in every single area it's ever been tried in - and we have the absolute opposite of a free market in education.
If the government ran any industry - say, automobiles - the way it runs education, automobiles would cost 100x as much, not work as well, and lots and lots of people would be blaming "conservatives" and stating that the government needs to do more (not less).
So you and your friends get duped into paying ridiculous amounts of money for a worthless degree, when you could have majored in something more useful, and/or gone to a less expensive institution. Believe me, it's still perfectly possible to get a useful degree at an affordable price these days.
It's also possible to get a job without a college degree.
And even if that weren't the case, you're not *entitled* to having work. The universe does not *owe* you anything, and neither do taxpayers. There is way too much whining around here - as you say, "all over reddit".
Yes, the previous generation has vastly damaged our beloved country. I agree with you there. The education system is a load of baloney, and the economy has been utterly strangled by the government.

Step 3: Bitcoin price shoots up
Step 4: Profit
I don't think that's what's going on with Microsoft, but that made me think of it. This strategy could actually be executed by the entire board of a company (and the company itself, not just the individuals executing the strategy, could even acquire lots of bitcoins prior).

The bad advice you've gotten so far is embarassing to this subreddit. At least, I think. Somebdoy please correct me if I'm wrong.
tl;dr: it will only take 1 transaction to send them to an exchange, so it'll be cheap to send. i think your client is just out of date.
You have two misconceptions.
(1) Bitcoins are "stored" in addresses, not transactions. All the transactions you're showing were sent to the same address, so all the bitcoins are in one big bundle.
(2) Even if you do send bitcoins from multiple addresses, you can do that in a single transaction, as long as those addresses are in the same wallet. So you only pay a single transaction fee.
Right now, the recommended transaction fee is .0005, which is basically nothing. I suspect your client is just really out of date and was last updated when 60.83 bitcoins was nothing.

With any investment, your investment strategy needs to match what you can reasonably guess based on your own knowledge.
If you can make a good prediction for the next 30 minutes, trade that. If you can make a good prediction for the next month, trade that. If you can make a good prediction for the next year, trade that. If you can make a good prediction for the next five-10 years, trade that.
For me, with bitcoin, it's generally the last.
Remember, a good prediction is not always a correct prediction. But that's OK. In investing, you just have to be right more often than you are wrong, and never bet the farm (i.e. more than you can afford to lose). Nobody is right all the time.

This issue is what gives me nightmares.
Many of the bitcoin forks are scams that try to steal your real bitcoins; pump and dumps; etc. Trying to trade these things may require you to deal with extremely shady and possibly criminal marketplaces. It's just too risky and burdensome for many bitcoin holders, and the historical prices are not necessarily "real" prices that you could liquidate a lot of forked coin at.
AFAIK the IRS policy is clear: you have to pay income tax on anything valuable, based on a fair price assessment.
But if these things are too burdensome/risky to sell, and the price is manipulated, there is no fair price assessment. 
Is there precedent for how the IRS treats this kind of situation? I know it was not worth my time/risk to sell any of these forked shitcoins (except BCH); but is there a way to argue that objectively in a way that would hold up to the IRS?

There is a fixed limit to the total amount of data in a block. However, not all transactions require the same amount of data. So, it doesn't work out that there is a specific maximum number of transactions.
If you want to see some examples, check out any block explorer.  is a good example. For example, block 491804, which was discovered about 5 minutes ago as of the time I'm writing this, had 1120 transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:06:57

@_date: 2017-10-26 18:17:19
The size of a block depends on the number of transactions included in the block, and how much data each of those transactions requires.
The basic reason not all transactions are the same size is because you can spend from multiple bitcoin addresses with one transaction. For example, if I have a transaction that spends from 20 source addresses and sends the bitcoin to 1 destination address, that is obviously going to require a lot more data than a transaction that spends from 1 source address to 1 destination address.
Even that is a bit of a simplification but it'll do.

And it would be thrown out in court. Sorry to dump water on your fire, but in the US and Europe, you can't just pay off the entire court system to get someone in trouble for something that isn't a crime.
Basically, you are spouting a paranoid conspiracy theory. Of course, conspiracies do happen sometimes, but there is no basis at all for what you are saying.

It's counter-intuitive, but I wouldn't rule it out. If you have sustained buying and selling, and then the pool of sellers starts to dry up (which IMHO makes sense right now), while the pool of buyers stays constant, you'll see big upward movements.
But those upward spikes will be counterbalanced by traders who want to take profit when they see big upward movements. So it won't just go up constantly to infinity.
At the end of the day it's all just supply and demand balancing out.
That said---of course there could be some whales/insiders doing big trades, I suppose.

Can an initially worthless digital token be bootstrapped into becoming a functioning currency that we can trust to retain value (instead of just being a bubble/hot potato)? Yes. Here is how it works:
Speculators purchase bitcoin in the hopes that its value will go up. Without that initial step, bitcoin would be worthless. But *with* that step, it can *actually be used* for trade by people who are *not* speculators. Because the person receiving bitcoins in exchange for a value they've provided, knows they can trade the bitcoins later to speculators to get value back for their bitcoins.
Over time (i.e. well into the future), the role of the speculator is replaced more and more by people who simply want to trade---they'll accept bitcoins now because they can spend them later. Also, by people who simply want a store of value. 
That said, is right in saying that most people will believe the things they want to believe and aren't willing to think carefully enough to determine if your arguments are right or wrong; don't waste your time on those people.

A chain is only bitcoin if both of the following hold:
1. It remains philosophically true to the original whitepaper. In contrast, *technical changes* over time are inevitable---that has been acknowledged by all from the beginning.
2. It has community consensus.
The current (segwit) chain clearly meets these conditions, and still will after the segwit2x fork.
Segwit2x is (perhaps) philosophically compatible with the whitepaper---the main problem is that it doesn't have community consensus.
And that's because people believe in second-layer scaling solutions over on-chain scaling. (Also because there aren't enough devs working on segwit2x for it to be technically sound.)

This general sentiment here is incredibly wrong-headed. Even a decentralized system needs strong leadership. The reason we have steady, high-quality development and the ability to resolve hardforks (intentional or accidental) is becuase we have very good, strong leadership that is recognized by almost the whole community. For instance, imagine if instead of Gavin, we had the Ripple people in leadership?
The world is absolutely full of shitty people and we are so lucky to have a few of the really good ones informally but heroically leading bitcoin. If it hadn't happened that way, bitcoin would have been dead on arrival.

I have studied that paper before. It does not make a valid case for your position.
The paper argues that at least one of three scenarios must be true; that we live in a simulation is just one of the three.
So even taking the paper at its word, you are wrong.
Moreover, the paper itself is utter garbage. For instance, the paper presumes that life must be prevalent in the universe, since humans evolved (ultimately) from chemistry. But it could be that life arising from chemistry is so rare that life is not at all prevalent in the universe.
That guy is a pitiful excuse for a "philosopher."
*Moreover*, it would not *matter* if we were in a simulation; it has no value implication. So again, there is no reason to assume one way or another.

You don't need to trust that the inputs are "real" (whatever that means), because it doesn't matter.
In other words, we perceive external reality (as we call it), and it doesn't matter if there is a computer simulation underneath that, or some other magic. Although there is no reason to presume that that is the case.

My guess: Basic supply and demand. The big picture, medium and long term, is that there are lots of people who want to buy bitcoin, and (basically) nobody wants to sell bitcoin.
Sure, there are some day traders and short-term speculators that sell bitcoin, but over time, their share of the bitcoin pie is getting smaller and smaller.
As for the huge spike we had a few hours ago---probably some rich guy bought up all the "cheap" coins around market price. In an environment where there was already low sell-side liquidity because of what I said before. So if you wanted to buy at that point it was expensive.
If people have a rational objection to this hypothesis, I'm all ears.

This announcement really downplays the most likely scenario, which is that there is no chainsplit because (almost) all the miners are already signalling for segwit at that point.
In the last 143 blocks 97% (all but 4) were committed to this, either by signalling segwit or by signalling segwit2x.

This is a good answer to OP's question.


I think it is a mistake to think the "true bitcoin" is the chain with the most work.

So educate yourself.
BIP91 could be locked in as early as July 23, at which point we basically know nothing bad will happen on Aug. 1. And it's looking increasingly likely that it will indeed by locked in because more than enough miners are signalling agreement to participate in BIP91.

In my estimation, It isn't likely that the chain will split on Aug. 1. Miner support for segwit2x, which would prevent the split, is strong. 
The closer we get, and the less likely a split looks, the more the price should recover. So yes, hodl.

If you are willing to hold for a while---until after the rally that happens when BIP91 gets locked in and averts the possibility chain split, resolving the crisis---absolutely.
BIP91 signalling starts on the 21st and lock-in could occur as early as the 23rd.
May take the market a little while after that to reflect the new information.
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:33:37
Right now 87.1% are signalling for segwit2x, which means a commitment to signal the BIP91 lock-in. To get locked in it only needs 80%.
The other thing to look at---go to the bottom of the page and look at the two columns on the right. Practically all are signalling either for segwit2x or BIP141 (segwit itself). So way more than what are signalling for segwit2x. Once BIP91 signalling starts, I *think* we will see a lot of those BIP141-only signallers also signalling for BIP91. That will help ensure we get over 80% signal to lock in BIP91.

If he gets the 2x part of Segwit2x, he is gaining on  for sure.
On point number 2, it's more complicated to analyze. I don't think Jihan is really gaining on  If you double space in the blocks, transactions will cost half as much, assuming constant demand, so it's all the same for Jihan. For Jihan to gain on point  there needs to be no off-chain alternative vs. putting every transaction in a block.
Anyway, segwit2x is not enforcable. We will have segwit, and then there may or may not be a latter attempt to hard fork to get the 2x blocks. If the miners do attempt that, much of the community is going to stay on the old chain.
The idea of segwit2x is just a concept announced by the miners---it's not actually an agreement between two parties that have reached a compromise.
That's why I said "if he gets the 2x part of segwit" at the beginning of my comment. Segwit2x is more like a capitulation to accepting segwit, along with an option to whine about/propagandize for a 2x blocksize increase later on.

It's like you have Bitcoin A and Bitcoin B. Maybe both will survive, or only one. If you try to send or receive coins on one chain, you are likely to inadvertently send or receive them on the other chain, though eventually, software will be developed to handle that.

I already told you I have read it. Claiming that I have not is not a valid part of an argument. Please stop behaving like a child.
The governance of bitcoin is that people can fork the code whenever they please, and then economic users determine which forks have value. Period. That isn't so much something that is covered in the white paper, but it's an inherent fact of open source code and of economics.
The miners have zero role in bitcoin governance. Though like any user they can choose which forks to participate in and try to convince others to do the same.
You are conflating "consensus" in a political sense with "consensus" in a distributed computing sense. Please see 
Bitcoin miners do provide consensus on the ordering of bitcoin transactions, to solve the double-spend problem, and that is the only thing they do.

In the governance of bitcoin, the miners have no role.
The governance of bitcoin is two fold:
1. Development: fork when there is irreconcilable disagreement (like with any open source software)
2. Users: Buy/hold coins on chain(s) you believe in and sell coins on chains you don't. In other words, basic economics.
Miners exist only to provide an ordering of transactions so as to resolve the double-spend problem.
They aren't even transaction validators (that is what nodes are for).

If BIP91 gets locked in there will still be a soft fork, but there won't be a chain split. A soft fork without a chain split is purely a good thing (in this case) and nothing to worry about. The chain split would be the problem.

True. I have no problem with the "validity" part of your statement. I'm just pointing out that given two valid chains, the one with the most proof of work wins, not the one with the highest number of blocks.


Blocks produced by segwit2x miners will be considered valid all the way up until the 2x hardfork happens late this year. We will most likely have lots of valid blocks produced by segwit2x miners. Because the segwit part of it is just fine.
I'm probably just nit picking at this point, though.
@_date: 2017-07-04 18:39:58
Jihan stalled endlessly on segwit. Then Segwit2x came up just barely in time to head off the Aug. 1 UASF.

That supports my point, not yours. He's saying: "I'm nothing special; lots of people could have accomplished this if given the opportunities I had." Which is a way to humble himself. People who feel guilty try to humble themselves. He doesn't feel like he deserves the money, so he finds it soothing to come out and say: "I don't deserve the money; I am nothing special; anybody could do it."


He's doing one better: Give away all his wealth, and keep making wealth so he'll have even more to give away. (By "one better" I mean in terms of soothing his guilt, he's doing something even better than what you said.)
If he was proud of his wealth he would put it to good use instead of giving it away. For instance, he could put all that money towards curing aging, or colonizing Mars, or whatever. Instead, he thinks its very important to give the money to charities which will simply consume it without producing much of anything valuable.
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:03:14


That is absolutely possible. In the simplest case, you can run a piece of software on your computer that pretends to be a bitcoin node (but doesn't down the blockchain) and  uses uacomment [1] to express an opinion.
However, it wouldn't accomplish anything, because bitcoin is not a democracy. It's not like bitcoin users or miners all vote on what to do. If we did, the ones that disagree would still go make their own fork instead of abiding by what was voted on. So there is no point in voting.


Right, I could just spin up 10,000 nodes, which is called a Sybil attack. This is a well-known problem in distributed systems and there is no direct solution for it.
In bitcoin, the closest thing to voting/democracy is that when people like bitcoin, they buy and hold them, driving the price up, and when people dislike bitcoin, they sell them, driving the price down.

Not really. Tezos coins won't come on the market until late 2017 at the earliest, and that is beyond the scope of the current chainsplit controversy.
ICOs coming on the market will actually cause some upward pressure. People convert fiat to bitcoin, which then ends up in the hands of the ICO peddlers, and only some of it gets converted back to fiat. Even if all of it got converted back to fiat, that is a net neutral effect on the bitcoin price.
Not many bitcoin hodlers are going to part with their dear coins for ICO shitcoins. If they really want them, they will use fiat and go through the above process.

In the short run what you are saying is fine, but in the long run, I'm right. Nobody today is day trading Enron stock, or the Zimbabwe currency for that matter.


It never had long waiting times if you are willing to pay higher fees. And since the Segwit2x agreement, it doesn't even have high fees.


Right. But that is misleading. Mining blocks faster also increases the chance of orphaned blocks. If you believe you need to wait for 6 confirmations in bitcoin, you would need to wait for 6x4=24 confirmations in litecoin---IF litecoin had the same difficulty of mining a block, which it doesn't.
Anyway, for big transactions waiting 10 minutes for more security isn't a big deal and for small ones we will have Lightning.
I am getting into the weeds here, but the point is that litecoin is not an innovation over bitcoin, and bitcoin has a big network effect advantage and a big advantage in developer and user manpower. Bitcoin is also harder to manipulate because it takes more money to do so. As a currency, bitcoin is by far superior right now.
Ultimately what we should expect in the cryptocurrency space is for everyone to be on the same currency, because it's a winner takes all situation, in an economic sense. There are edge cases where that may not happen, but that's getting into the weeds.


There is no high-frequency trading of assets that nobody wants to hold long-term. Those assets are worth zero.
In fact, high-frequency traders are just providing liquidity to other market participants who are not high-frequency traders. But again, weeds.
The crypto market is highly immature. A lot of it is pump and dump. It's amateur hour. A lot of people are getting scammed. That's just how it is with an immature market for an emerging technology. It's not going to stay that way forever. Over time the market will find out what is a shitcoin and what is not and prices will reflect it. In 10 years, if I release a silly new coin named for a breed of dog, it is going to be worth zero and stay there.

The thing about currencies is that, while they are subject to speculative bubbles, in the long run, good currency drives out the bad.
Which version of bitcoin functions better as currency will matter in the long run.
Institutional investors analyze things that are far more complex than two competing versions of bitcoin every day. The ones that do not are not able to stay in the game long term.


People used to make the same kind of arguments before there were altcoins, or at least more than litecoin. Increasing the supply of a currency B that is not fungible with currency A, does not have the effect of increasing the supply of currency A.

You don't need to do anything.
There is a possibility of a chain split on Aug. 1. In that case, if you tried to send or receive bitcoins, you might end up inadvertently doing it on the wrong (or both) chains. So if you keep the bitcoins through the chain split, don't plan on doing any transactions until it's sorted out. If the chain split is permanent, software will be released to split your coins and control them separately on each chain. But it looks like no chain split will happen anyway.
To be clear, if there is a chain split, your coins now exist on both chains. So you would have ~10 on each.

2x doesn't get rid of core developers.

It's really the chain with the most accumulated proof of work, not the longest in terms of number of blocks.

No, bitcoin will split into two separate coins. There will be two separate coins with 21 million each. That does not mean there are 42 million bitcoin.
Nor would it be rational to expect the value of coins on each chain to be 1/2 of the current value of a bitcoin. The value of coins on each chain should be much less than the current value of bitcoin, but they are most likely going to rapidly diverge from one another in price.
In the case of a chain split like this, the most realistic scenario is that the community gloms on to one coin (which will then be consider the successor to bitcoin, aka "bitcoin") and the other will become like an altcoin.

They use the phrase of words to generate private keys and addresses. Which is all you really need to send/receive bitcoin.
When you use a client that downloads the whole blockchain, your client is able to verify the transaction history. When you use a lightweight client, you are trusting a remote server to attest to the transaction history.
So with a lightweight wallet you are slightly more at risk of being tricked into believing you have received bitcoins that you haven't really received.
That said, the difficulty of someone performing that attack generally won't be worth the reward. You would have to be dealing with a really huge quantity of bitcoin.

I will be the last person to minimize Satoshi's accomplishment, but I don't agree with your reasoning here.


Satoshi solved the double-spend problem and built a clever system around that. That is the accomplishment.
Writing a nine-page paper is not a separate accomplishment from that. Writing a nine-page paper is not that hard. Satoshi is a *good* writer, but lots of people are good writers.


As a former academic, that is simply not the case.


So the difference between "even more unusual" and "bordering on absurd" is that the implementation *works*? Um, OK. I think you are trying too hard.
By the way, tons of computer science academics write papers and write code.


That is not the case. Satoshi's code was viewed by other early Bitcoin developers as competent but amateurish. I don't have a citation for this, but you can probably look it up somewhere or just ask people.

No. Everybody expects a huge upswing when the chainsplit crisis is resolved, and it's looking more and more everyday that there is going to be smooth sailing. People are going to start buying in, and holders are going to keep holding. Because people want to beat that upswing. If it's obvious nothing is going to happen on Aug 1, people are not going to wait until Aug 1 to start buying in.
I would say "the time to sell was in the past," but frankly, there was no obvious time to sell.
The other thing to mention here is that because exchanges are risky with large amount of money (and have bad support), a lot of trading happens with OTC traders, and that incurs real costs (and tax implications). For many hodlers it is better to weather the storm than try to play the dips even if there is a bit of money to be had there.

Your comment makes no sense.


And there was never a commitment to a hard fork block size increase, and it wasn't even conceivable that there would be. So there was no real commitment on Jihan's part to segwit.


No it doesn't. Nobody can force economic users of bitcoin to go to big blocks, so there is no one to make such a commitment. It's just an empty idea that is unenforceable.
What Segwit2x means is that we get segwit, and then later we have a big fight and fork bitcoin if the big blockers really insist on it. Because the "try lightning and wait and see" camp is not going to budge.
If such a fork happens, either economic users either switch to big blocks, or don't, or we have two coins like with ETH and ETC.
So given all the above, why is Jihan going to adopt segwit? Well, IF he does, which he may not, it's just because it's in his economic interest to do so because if he doesn't, a fork WILL happen, and people WILL NOT want to hold his Chinacoin, so then he won't be able to mine profitably, so then he'll have to switch back to the small block chain anyway.

That is a mistaken premise. The majority does not dictate scientific facts, nor can they dictate what the appropriate terminology to use is given a factually historical precedent that indicates otherwise.
There are people to this day who say that fiat currency is not technically "money." If the "majority" starts using the word "bitcoin" to describe something that betrays bitcoin's principles, I will be one of the ones saying otherwise. And with a lot more ground to stand on than the people who argue about "money" vs. "fiat".
The majority cannot change facts, or the correct inferences from facts.
If the majority says litecoin is bitcoin, the majority is wrong. (Of course it won't happen, because there are too many people that are cognizant of what I'm saying here, at least implicitly, for it to work.)

Wrong. The miners have no role in governance. They merely order transactions, resolving the double-spend problem.

Block size is an engineering choice but decentralization is a philosophical choice. To "keep bitcoin bitcoin," the latter is essential and the former is not.
In other words, what it means to be bitcoin is to be *philosophically* consistent.
I would be fine with a blocksize increase if I believed it would not threaten decentralization.


Why wouldn't it be?


I'm not sure I can parse this sentence as you intended.
Miner revenues will always be sufficient to secure the network. If some miners have to drop out because their operations are too inefficient, difficulty goes down. So there is a dynamic adjustment going on.
If you are worried about the distant future when the block reward is tiny and miners rely on fees---we could consider a blocksize change closer to that point.
@_date: 2017-06-24 05:22:42
The real governance of bitcoin is economic.
Smart money (holders, traders) will select a bitcoin chain with more decentralization or the ability to do 2nd layer scaling, over one that does not.
That is why the miners kind of have to accept segwit, despite not wanting to do so, or face going out of business.
If we really have to end up having a contentious fork, so be it---you will get chaos for a little bit and then it will go back to the same place, where the smart money is on the chain that has segwit (and thus lightning) and is more decentralized.

The smallest unit in bitcoin is 0.00000001 bitcoin.
You can't time the market in the short or medium term, so nobody can give you good advice on your question about the price other than to say: If bitcoin is successful, the future value is going to be a large multiple of what it is now.
There were people who faced the same dilemma as you when bitcoin was at $10, $100, and $1000.
So if you believe in bitcoin, buy some, but don't put more money in than you can afford to lose.
As far as short and medium term speculation: Sometimes it's pretty evident that bitcoin is in a "trough" and sometimes it looks pretty evident that it's in a "bubble," but now is not either of those times.

No, the most likely outcome is that segwit is adopted by the miners slightly before ~~USAF~~ UASF kicks in (Aug. 1), so we simply get segwit.
After that it would remain to be seen whether we eventually get the 2x hardfork or not.
I do agree with you that there is no problem with the timing of segwit. If the miners won't adopt it, the users will do it on their own. Once segwit is in place the economic majority, which is the real governance of bitcoin, will immediately and overwhelmingly adopt it. Smart money will go to the segwit chain and everyone else will follow shortly thereafter.

If you have coins in your own custody at the time of a fork (any fork), you will have coins on both forks/chains afterwards.
On the other hand, if you have coins in someone else's custody (say, coinbase), your account is just a row in their database. They could choose to only honor your coins on only one fork or another, depending on their policy.
In general you shouldn't leave coins in someone else's custody for a long period of time because it creates a risk (e.g. if the other party disappears, is hacked, goes insolvent, etc.) and there's really no upside to it.

What are they going to do, nationalize Nvidia? It's not so easy.


Even if they purchased 100% of GPUs produced, which is impossible, it would take a long time for them to surpass the number of GPUs already out in the wild and available for bitcoin mining.
At first glance I agree with you that it's not necessarily impossible for certain nations to perform this attack, but I think you are underestimating the difficulty.
The likelihood of this actually happening, realistically, is near zero. Not only because it is super hard to do, but also because it requires a lot of forethought, planning, and political willpower and consensus.
It would be very difficult for organizations of this size to achieve the level of internal consensus needed to carry out this plan. Even the Chinese Communist party, which is definitely not a monolithic entity.


I don't think this is a realistic technique. There are a limited number of mining pools and mining companies in the world. I think it would be practical for community members to carefully check new entrants to make sure they are legitimate before adding them to the list.
Anyway, this particular way of solving the problem may not be the best, so you don't really gain anything by poking holes in it if you are just trying to win an argument.


I was talking about regular banks, not central banks.
Anyway, central banks and governments are not monolithic entities, they are composed of individuals with many different interests. If bitcoin really looks to be poised to take over the world, many of these individuals are going to prefer to invest in bitcoin over trying some crazy scheme to shut it down. This goes back to the problem I mentioned before about the difficulty of achieving consensus within these kinds of organizations.

It only takes 1 CPU to mine bitcoin blocks. That's how this all started.
The difficulty will be too high, but you can just do a difficulty reset/adjustment as part of the fork.
And if the miners try to DDOS that, you can do a POW change.
But that will not likely be necessary, as I explain below.
If miners screw up the chain we have now, the economic majority is going to switfly and massively abandon it and adopt the chain that is philosophically consistent with the original bitcoin concept.
What people do not realize is that the power in bitcoin is 100% economic (investors, holders, traders, and users doing transactions). That is the true governance.
Frankly, if the miners ruin bitcoin as we know it now, they will probably end up flocking to the new corrected chain so that they can keep making money and not go out of business. And that's fine, we want that, so it's unlikely we would need a POW change.
Bitcoin is a honey badger. Not because it's a cool meme but because it actually is an antifragile, resilient and self-governing system.

I think you are taking "proof of work" too literally. The point was always to find a nonce that hashes to a number below the difficulty target, and that is what asicboost does. It is doing the work, just more efficiently.
That said, I agree with you that asicboost is a huge problem because it gives some miners an advantage over others, which over time will tend to increase centralization. So the system needs to be changed (e.g. by deploying segwit) to eliminate that advantage.
I think that is what we should be arguing, not whether or not asicboost is "cheating" or forging work in some way.

It never costs money to receive bitcoins, since transaction fees are paid by the sender.
It always costs money to send bitcoins, for the same reason.
If you want to receive coins to an offline wallet, you just give the sender an address from that wallet.
If you want to spend coins from an offline wallet, you have two options:
a) Put the wallet onto an online computer and send coins the normal way
b) Create a bitcoin transaction, sign it on the offline computer using a key from the offline wallet, and then transport the transaction to an online computer (e.g. with a USB stick), and then transmit to the bitcoin network.
You could also *possibly* just give the offline wallet to someone else. That avoids having to pay a transaction fee, but it would mean two people now have custody of the wallet (if you kept a copy) and can spend the bitcoins, so it's super insecure.

Miners should not be in the business of censoring transactions. That sets an extremely dangerous precedent and hurts the fungibility of bitcoin.

That is false. Anybody can fork bitcoin in an afternoon by changing a variable somewhere. The miners do not "maintain" the chain, or bitcoin. All they do is provide a consensus mechanism for the ordering of transactions.


Quite the opposite. I am starting to think we the norm to be "talk less, fork early and often." The smart money is always going to follow the philosophically proper chain. Using the strategy I'm suggesting would have resulted in everybody switching to segwit months ago. A fork should not be this massively controversial thing.

It's completely politically infeasible to have non-voting-authority groups running an election, at least in the US.
People are going to strongly object to the organizations they don't like participating, and justifiably so. An election is a governmental function, not a function of various lobbying groups and special interests.
Having third parties run an election is a violation of authority, in the same way that having PETA help out with the sherrif's office is a violation of authority.


Not joking, I would not vote in a US election with international monitoring groups as active participants, because it would taint the whole election and is a violation of US sovereignty.
Now, what you could do is divide the actual election authorities into a bunch of sub-groups and have those sub-groups run SMPC. And the election authorities typically include representation from the different political parties participating in the election.

LN literally cannot hurt decentralization because it is a layer 2 solution. If it sucks (it won't), just don't use it and keep doing on-chain transactions. So your comment makes no sense.
Anyway, of course people will create decentralized routing algorithms for LN.
And LN should be made up of lots of highly diverse entities (so, the opposite of centralization) because anyone in the world with capital can run a node profitably.
In that sense it's like bitcoin mining except without electricity costs and without having to buy hardware.

So you could do (a) or (b) above.
To do (a), you just download some bitcoin wallet software onto your computer (e.g. bitcoin-qt, electrum, etc.) and import the private keys by typing them into the software (probably easy to figure out how to do that but depends on what software you get).
To do (b), you need to have bitcoin wallet software on an online computer and also on an offline computer. Then you import your private keys onto the offline computer and proceed as I described in my earlier post.

2. It appears most likely that the Chinese miners simply capitulated to users' threats of UASF. To not do so would kill the goose that lays the golden egg. This proves that users still have the ultimate power.

If you keep increasing the blocksize to try to keep transaction fees at some arbitrary low value, hosting the blockchain will eventually become a real problem, even for businesses.
Users do need to be able to host a node at home if they want to, otherwise we have no way to check to see that the rules are being followed in the blockchain.

I think there is some confusion here.


Ultimately, anybody can run any potential fork of bitcoin or any altcoin. Nobody *really* has power. It's a voluntary system.
The number of nodes is no exception to that. You absolutely *could* run a node that drops blocks and transactions it doesn't like according to any set of rules you want. It just wouldn't accomplish anything. Other nodes that don't like your rule set will start ignoring your node.
If you get a whole collection of these nodes going, congratulations, you have your own coin (if you are also mining)---but probably your new coin will be worth nothing and nobody will want it.
The other problem with big blocks that your post does not mention is that larger blocks propagate over the network slower, which is going to advantage miners that are geographically centralized (which, right now, is China). To me personally, that is more concerning than the issue you did mention where big blocks make it harder to run a node.
Ultimately, if the community cannot reach a consensus on block size and/or segwit, there will just be two different kinds of bitcoin. However I am quite optimistic that we will reach a consensus.
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:03:41
There is no point in continually increasing the blocksize rather than using layer-2 scaling solutions because if bitcoin is successful as a currency, that will not scale. Period.
It doesn't matter if you have relatively high fees if you have layer-2 scaling solutions. Period.
A lot of bitcoin's appeal to holders/investors/traders/consumers (the economic majority that actually governs bitcoin via the invisible hand) comes from its technical and philosophical stability and the maturity of its community. This is related to its first-mover advantage. It's more important for bitcoin to be bitcoin than for bitcoin to be not-bitcoin.

It's what Ayn Rand named her philosophy.
As for what her philosophy is... basically, she corrected some fundamental errors in metaphysics, epistemology and ethics that were keeping people from developing a rational philosophy (in constrast to basically all previous philosophies, which deny reason and instead turn either to faith or to some form of skepticism). The main prior exception to that was the basic reality-oriented approach taken by Aristotle, and Objectivism is very much a return to Aristotle's approach.
The quote at the top of this page [1] has a good one-sentence super-high-level summary on her conclusions.
There is slightly more high-level elaboration on what she concluded here [2].

In fact you can predict that everyone will not sell at the same time. Why would they? The recent governance crisis is an example of the principle that bitcoin is fundamentally resilient.
Even in a really bad case, like if the miners went psycho and we had to have a hardfork and a POW change, the economic majority is going to go with the chain that is consistent with bitcoin's principles, and the price is going to recover.
UASF proves that that threat is meaningful and can be carried out if necessary, and that the mere threat of it is going to motivate miners to behave better most (if not all) of the time.

My point is, this doesn't matter. Rights are in everyone's self-interest, and quibbling about the technicalities of government authority just isn't important. I think this is something Rand would agree with, which is probably why she didn't care about low-level semantic issues that a lot of libertarians and anarcho-capitalists pick on her for. She wasn't an idiot; if her philosophy was blatantly contradictory, she would have seen that.

A miner running a BIP91 client will produce a block that has the 4th version bit set. If a core node sees that, it doesn't care, it relays the block just like normal.
Basically the answer to your question is that Core already supports BIP91 implicitly. BIP91 is compatible with Core. That's the whole point. BIP91 was designed that way on purpose.
Only miners are paying attention to that 4th bit. BIP91 is basically a way for miners to communicate to one another.

There is absolutely nothing morally wrong with breaking laws as long as you don't hurt anyone else. It's just a calculation: Can you get away with it or not? Ross did not get away with it, unfortunately, but he should not be condemned for it. He is a victim, not a criminal (morally speaking; legally, of course, he is a criminal).
This is setting aside the question of whether he had people murdered. If you think he did, that may change the calculus. It doesn't necessarily, for me. If the goverment has neglected its responsibility to protect your rights and you are threatened, you may have no choice but to defend yourself. Of course, whether it's right in a specific case depends on its specific nature, and I have not been following Ross's trial closely in this regard, so have no real opinion.

Exactly - there is no _technical_ solution (to the problem of enrolling eligible people, and only eligible people, once each, to actually make votes). So the fact that bitcoin can't provide a technical solution here is not a viable argument against using bitcoin to do voting.


Well, we can't have that, for obvious reasons, but I don't think we need that.
Anyway, if you are willing to concede that there is no need for a _technical_ solution to enrolling voters, bitcoin solves the other problems: making it so that the _count_ of the vote is public, and so that each person can verify that their vote (in fact, that _every_ vote) was counted.
One problem is anonymity. If I present the government my public key and am given one satoshi (as part of the voter enrollment step), a nefarious government agent could track who I vote for. One solution would be to separate the process of voter verification and receiving the satoshi. e.g., in one room, you prove that you are eligible; go into a separate room, to provide your public key. There may be (probably are) more elegant, technological ways to achieve anonymity, e.g. perhaps some kind of mixing service.

I had not read it until just now, I had only skimmed it.


The authority of the government based on the delegation of individuals' rights to it, is a moral abstraction. It doesn't mean the individual could have decided to withhold their delegation of their rights and instead delegate it to some other entity. "Having" a right doesn't necessarily mean you can delegate it _in practice_.
In the quotes you have about groups' rights coming from the rights of the members, she is talking about voluntary associations, such as corporations, formed voluntarily and using contractual agreements, based on the choice of individual members. So it's a separate issue. You're taking it out of context to think that the government is a "group" in that sense. Clearly, she did not think that a governments' rights are based on voluntary contractual agreement. If she had, she would have said so, and she would have supported anarcho-capitalism, or something otherwise different from what she did support.

When a fork happens it's like the entire bitcoin system gets copied, and one copy has new rules while the other copy has old rules. So instead of having, say, 5 Bitcoins, you could have 5 of Bitcoin-A and 5 of Bitcoin-B. Your coins have doubled in quantity.
You are going to have to figure out how to make sure you are only spending Bitcoin-A or Bitcoin-B and not accidentally spending both at the same time. As I understand it, exactly how to do this is going to depend on the technical details of how the fork happens, so I don't think anyone can tell you right now, but you should be able to find a tutorial or someone to help you after any specific fork happens. It's probably going to end up that you have a separate wallet for each coin. The point is, as long as you have the coins in your custody before the fork, you are guaranteeing you have them on both chains after the fork, which is the outcome you want.
Anyway, I don't really think a fork is going to happen on August 1. It *could*, though, so it's good to be thinking about it.

You are right. Andreas says "we can change the protocol," but does not actually get into the specifics that would answer your question.
Though the points he makes about chip fabrication do knock out all but maybe 2 or 3 countries, and makes it iffy for those. For instance, North Korea would not be able to acquire enough GPUs to perform this attack, for any price. There are too many GPUs already out there, and more are being produced all the time, and NK is light-years from being able to produce GPUs themselves.
Maybe China or the US could, but it's very iffy. And we would all know about it.
So what if China or the US did this? I'm not sure. We could make the bitcoin network censor blocks with no transactions, but then the attacker could produce "fake" blocks with just their own transactions.
Like someone else said, there are "warty" solutions. For instance, we as a community could create a list of "valid" miners (anyone who isn't attacking the network) and censor all other blocks. A "valid" block is cryptographically signed by a miner who is on the list of "valid" miners.
Perhaps someone smarter than me could think of something much better than this.
It would not be worth it for banks to spend billions of dollars on this attack---if they think bitcoin is going to be that great, they would be smarter simply investing in bitcoin.

You are conflating rights, which are moral principles, with the actual enforcement of rights.
There is a difference between the two, so no, I'm not contradicting myself.


We all have rights everywhere all the time, because they are abstract moral principles. But the enforcement of rights isn't free. Somebody has to pay for it. Somebody has to decide who pays and how, and what happens if they don't pay. That's just the way that practical reality is.
If there were some ideal country that enforced rights properly, but charged a fee when you cross the border to enforce your rights based on the length of your stay (say you're just visiting), I would not call that a rights violation, on the technicality that rights do not apply [1] in a state of nature (in the Hobbesian sense, i.e., a place with no government at all), and because government is an institution that converts a state of nature to a state of being governned, i.e., it arises out of a state of nature. But I think this is an unimportant technicality. If you want to insist that that would be a rights violation, that's fine---I would say "well, we have to violate some rights to enforce rights in general, that's better than nothing." The principle is clear here, and it's just quibbling over technicalities that is better left for lawyers and philosophers. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Rights are a human construct, and nature/reality doesn't care about such things, and we have to deal with that in a practical way. So we should aim for an ideal that, arguably, is only 99.9% achievable.
It's like when you talk to a socialist and they're like, "But without government, who would build the roads?" I say, "Who cares? Eliminate the 99.9% of government abuse. I don't really care about a minor issue like road-building. That is not important enough to be a valid objection to laissez-faire capitalism." This is the same thing. A society where no force is used at all, ever, would be ideal. If we can't possibly have that, since nature does not automatically guarantee that---we strive to get as close as possible.
[1] To anticipate an objection: How can rights not apply if we all have rights all the time? Becuase rights are rules _for governing_. No such rules are applicable in practice when there is no governing entity. Just like the rules of Monopoly are not applicable when we're playing Scrabble.

He probably didn't predict how strongly the community would insist on segwit. Including UASF, the Core developers, and the community at large. He may have thought that by resisting segwit, he could kill it.
On a deeper level, reasons Jihan might have to oppose segwit for as long as possible, or forever:
1. Wanting to preserve his ASICboost advantage. Segwit eliminates that.
2. Wanting to favor on-chain scaling (since miners collect more fees that way) over off-chain scaling (e.g. lightning network and other layer 2 solutions). Of course off-chain scaling still ultimately uses the blockchain, so resisting it seems to not be in his best interest in the long run, but who knows.
3. Bigger blocks slows down block propagation times, which works in the favor of miners centralized in China.

A speculator bets on a rise in value over an *unspecified* time frame. I'm really talking about medium- to long-term speculators, so let's focus on that. However, the short-term speculators also help by smoothing the price out (exactly to the degree that they are rational.. which they aren't always, hence bubbles. Still, it helps.).
Now, imagine there are only 2 people using Bitcoin, and they are geographically far apart. They want to use it just for trade. It won't work, because one of them is just stuck with bitcoins, and with nobody else to trade with. Even if you have 10 or 20 or 1000 people trading bitcoin, that is not enough (in general) for traders to just hold onto bitcoin. They need to liquidate their bitcoins so they can use their wealth to obtain other goods. That only stops being the case when bitcoin is a major local currency where the trader lives, or if they do a ton of online business with other bitcoin traders every day, etc.
In the meantime, there has to be some way for traders using bitcoin to liquidate their bitcoin and actually be able to buy things. That's where speculators come in. Speculators (in this case) are people who are willing to give someone something of value for bitcoin, and then just hold onto bitcoin for a while.


Not really. If you and I are just traders, and I buy bitcoin, send them to you, and you liquidate them, you're not establishing a floor. The person you sell them to is. No amount of traders can close this loop. You need people who will _hold on_ to bitcoin, not immediately liquidate it. If _everyone_ always wanted to immeditely liquidate (i.e., if everyone were a trader), the price would be zero.
If you are selling a service for bitcoin but then hold on to the bitcoins, note that you are both a trader and a speculator.

Although I think it's unlikely that bitcoin will go to zero, the general rule is, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
The unique thing about investing in bitcoin is that is has higher potential upside and downside compared to most other investments. You could make 10, 100 or 1000x your investment, but you could also potentially lose nearly all of it. I think that makes it a highly attractive investment if you believe in the long-term fundamentals and if you have some money you would be OK losing.


Yes. And it could suddenly devalue for other reasons (e.g. new regulations).


The value proposition of bitcoin is that it will serve as an international currency that cannot be manipulated politically. Sort of like the euro, but without the problems of the euro. Nobody can say whether that will happen. There are no clear signs that it will or won't be the case.


A new bitcoin block is produced on average once every 10 minutes, and each block can only have 1 MB worth of transactions. It's not really that scalable. There are a number of plans in the works to improve scalability, and there is a lot of politicking going on about the best way to do it. The scalability problem will definitely be resolved, but in the worst (and unlikely case, I would say), it will result in multiple competing versions of bitcoin, called "forks." Probably we will have a big scalability improvement settled on by the end of July but after that there will be more politicking about doing more. We will hopefully see "2nd-layer solutions," like the Lightning network, that allow cheap and secure bitcoin transfers off the blockchain.

It means you have the right to go there, live there, and have your individual rights protected.
Individual rights are inalienable. (As mentioned in the US Declaration of Independence, though that's not the evidence that they are inalienable.) You have a right to be free from coercion, and you have that right everywhere you go. You have that right in China and you have that right in the United States.
The US is rightfully your country, and China is rightfully my country.
The US is the country that once came closest to actually recognizing this, in human history, and is the only country to be founded on this premise.
EDIT: Just because somebody takes something from you by force, doesnt mean it's not rightfully yours. And that's precisely the distinction I'm making.

No. There is a difference between "regulation" and "breach of contract."
A regulation is a law that indirectly initiates force against someone.
Breach of contract occurs when one party fails to uphold a voluntary agreement between parties. Fraud is a special case of this.
We have courts to handle _arbitrary_ breach of contract cases, and thus don't need regulation to protect ourselves from breach of contract.

Doesn't matter.
I've been searching for a better way to explain my point, and it's been elusive, so here's one more try.
In the US, there are some important political principles. (If you're an American, this little lecture may be insulting, but I'm just assuming you're not, for full generality.) One is that political power ultimately comes from the people via an election. Another is that there is a separation of concerns within government, known as "checks and balances," such that different parts of the government can legally block one another's action.
The first principle rules out outside organizations such as the EFF. The second principle rules out all governmental organizations other than the actual elections officials and those appointed by them specifically to help run the election, such as the FBI.
In fact, the FBI is a really egregious one, because you don't want what amounts to a federal police force having anything to do with elections, which are typically administered _by the states_, not the federal government. But even a mundane case, such as having the local bureau of housing regulation participate, would still be violating the idea of separation of concerns.
I don't know if there is a formal name for either of these principles, but I do believe that they would widely be acknowledged as preventing the kind of thing you're describing.
Actually, these two principles are interrelated, because not only is the local housing regulation bureau situation violating separation of concerns, it's also deuptizing the housing bureau to do something that they were not vested power in via (ultimately) the vote of the people. Those officials have been authorized by agents of the people _to regulate housing_, but they have not been authorized in the same way to monitor or supervise voting.
The entire American conception of government is based around the idea of limited powers for government officials. They can _only_ do what they've been explicitly permitted to do by law. (Lately, the US has thrown this idea down the toilet, particularly with the TSA, but it's not totally gone yet.)


Becuase no other international entity has any legitimate interest or authority in a US election. (FWIW, I think the UN is an anti-US laughingstock organization from which the US and its allies should withdraw.)
In practice, international observers could claim a rigged election is valid, or they could claim a valid election is rigged. Allowing them to participate is giving them the opportunity to do so.
Also, it would violate principle  above.

It's a package deal. It's lumping together the honest people who work in finance, with the dishonest. Let's be frank: There are lots of honest people in finance, and they are victims, just like we are. But, yes, there are also many guilty people in finance, I'm not trying to ignore that.
Let's point the finger where we ought to: Government officials and voters who believe in using coercive government power to overrule people's own free choices and interactions, and bankers who encourage that and take advantage of it.
And among the bankers, it's hard to tell who is really guilty, and who is just doing it because if they don't, the guilty ones will put regulations in place to put them out of business. You have to fight regulations with the same game (pulling government favors); there is no other way to do it.
Of course, if you go back to the actual creation of the Fed and many of the regulatory agencies, who is good and who is bad is much easier to distinguish.
As a sidenote, Rothbard was just stealing parts of Ayn Rand's ideas, taking them out of context and thus greatly distorting them, and then taking credit for them in a dishonest way. So it's not surprising he'd conflate the good with the bad and merge them into one concept.

You are missing my point.
There won't be any of the problems you're talking about, because forking the code doesn't require consensus. It's the open source model.
There won't be 4 years to arrive at a compromise. It will just be forking, and then the economics playing out (i.e. smart money and users will go to the best chain).
Not taking 4 years to reach a shitty compromise is exactly the point.
What we have now is not decentralization... it's a small cabal of miners holding the users hostage, which is ridiculous because they don't actually have the power to do that, people just don't realize that the power lies with the economic majority, NOT the miners.
The way I envision it, when there needs to be a fork, 10 different people can do 10 different forks with 10 different difficulties. It will quickly become evident, by the price, which fork the economic community has settled on.
The whole thing about honoring utxos is a red herring. Of course we are going to honor prior utxos. A chain that doesn't do that has zero economic value, ever, because the whole POINT is that there are going to be many forks in the future. A chain that loses its utxos every time it gets forked is literally worthless garbage.

Yes, it is.


That's why you say it's not clean? That's ridiculous. You can stick this stuff deep in Yucca Mountain (or similar places) and it's just a non-issue, except to enviro-fundies.


That word doesn't mean anything. It's just Marxist rhetoric that is empty of any meaning. When someone uses it (outside of a valid context in physics), it's a sign of thinking that is disconnected from reality.


There is absolutely no evidence for this claim. The free market is not only the most efficient way to bring all the essentials to people, it's the _only_ way that truly works. Compare the famine of Soviet Russia to the prosperity of the United States. Now, see all that poverty in Africa? Which of these two systems would actually solve that problem? Look at China. They're doing pretty well---to the extent that they _don't_ practice government control.


So? Hopefully, they will stretch less far, becuase they're not very good for human habitation right now.


At least this is the (first) scientifically debatable claim, and if it were true that a continuation of the rate of pollution would, say, make the Earth non-inhabitable (or some other very serious problem), it would be a valid reason to impose controls. So, I would suggest that you foucs your argument around this kind of thing in the future. That said, I don't really buy it (yet).


That's why Monsanto and other companies develop new crops, pesticides, etc. If the yields go down, their profits go down, and people are incentivized to create a better solution. Which is why yields are at an astounding all-time high.


That's actually just untrue. Nature is not some rampant, uncontrollable, malevolent, non-comprehensible force. And the fact is that what nature took millenia to evolve, modern science has been able to counter/improve in decades. For example, pesticides vs. pests, improving the genetics of crops, etc.
It's laughable (but also sad) that you sit here bad-mouthing Monstanto, when you are literally getting to eat more food because of advances they have made!


A few degrees won't make a big difference. You know what would actually help? Air conditioning. But the kinds of controls you advocate will make air conditioning much more expensive to produce and transport!


See, there it is - the idea that sacrifice is a moral imperative.
What you call "a few creature comforts," though, is a pretty damn big difference in the third world. Advocacy against industrial progress actually results in _more_ people dying and living impoverished lives.

Bitcoin can allow everyone to see that every vote has been counted, which you can't with today's systems (paper ballots or voting machines), so you're just fundamentally wrong. 
The only obvious problems that remain are (a) making sure it's anonymous and (b) enrolling voters, which is fundamentally an issue of tracking individual people (eligible voters) and therefore not very amendable to a technical solution anyway.

Because that force will be applied to *all* big businesses, not just the major offenders. Actually, the major offenders will be fare better because they will use their influence in government to escape punishment. The more innocent businesses will be punished more harshly. So you're actually arguing for what BoA, Verizon, etc. probably *want*.


I don't buy at all that there is some kind of conspiracy here. The reason the economy is stagnant is because of massive regulation.
If we had a free market, who cares if rich people rip off other rich people? That is why we have courts and lawsuits and people have to do due diligence. In a free market, these kind of shenanigans would still happen, but the amount of damage they would do would be limited and miniscule compared to the overall economy. Note that the LIBOR banks are probably all regulatory clients of governments and are all way overpowered via regulatory capture, so yes, that contributes to the problem. But you can't let a few traders acting badly *with the permission of the government* taint, in your mind, all traders.


Sorry about that. 401(k)'s should be OK though (but overall stagnant vs. the money supply). I mean, the stock market hasn't tanked since 2008 (but if a lot of your capital was in the market at that point, you will never recover from that).

Not necessarily. First, the Fed can just print money, devaluing the USD. Second, the USD's preferentiality for certain kinds of trade is largely due to the US government's demand that it be used as legal tender and used to pay taxes, so the value of the dollar depends on the power of the US government and the US economy.


It has a lot of properties that make it preferential for certain kinds of trade. For instance, it can be transferred quickly over the Internet without needing a trusted middleman (a la PayPal or Western Union). Unlike fiat currencies, you don't have to trust your bank (and the international banking system). Unlike gold, you can transport it easily without needing to worry about physical security. Unlike fiat currencies, it can't be inflated. I would argue that these properties are what makebitcoin useful, and that usefulness is what makes it rational to anticipate liquidity between bitcoin and other valuable things into the future.

WoW gold is "virtual currency" for the same reason a structure or a landmass in WoW is "virtual."
If you use WoW gold for real-world transactions, you are using it as a means of exchange and potentially a currency. I say "potentially" because some people want to define "currency" to imply a certain amount of liquidity or volume.
So the definitions are totally clear. The blur is that WoW gold is a virtual currency that can also _potentially_ used as a real currency.

I'll just give the most basic form.
Normally, when you vote, you validate your identity with an election official using a government-granted ID (e.g. driver's license). The election official checks to make sure that the same ID has not already received a ballot. If not, you get the ballot. (I call everything up to this the "enrollment process.") You fill out the ballot, and either put it into a voting machine where it is automatically counted, or put it into a box where it is manually counted.
(Obviously, there are variations on this, but that's the basic setup.)
I don't see a technological solution to the enrollment process. So the enrollment process is basically the same. The difference I'm proposing, is that rather than receiving a ballot from the election official, you present the official with a public bitcoin address. (You already have the private address, which you, the voter, have created.) The official then sends you a satoshi.
Now, you send the satoshi to an address corresponding to the candidate for whom you are voting.
To tally the votes, you count the number of satoshis residing in each vote address, excluding any satoshi that did _not_ originate from the election officials' wallet that was used to dispense satoshi to voters.
In this scheme, the level of security in the enrollment process is the same. i.e. election officials can create an arbitrary amount of ballots and use them in any way they want, for example.
However, the tallying process is overt and provably correct. You no longer have to trust either a voting machine, or a manual ballot count. Every member of the public can both count the total number of votes, and see that their vote was included in the count.
That's actually a big deal, because voting machines have been known to be a source of voting fraud in US elections (and elsewhere too, no doubt) in the past.
One obvious downside to this system is that you can prove that you voted for a particular candidate by signing a message with the private key used to send the voting satoshi. This allows vote-selling, threatening people with violence if they don't vote a certain way, etc.
There are possibly ways around this obvious downside. There are also probably ways to improve the enrollment process.
Other potential problems are that it pollutes the blockchain and could be vulnerable to bitcoin network peers not transmitting votes they don't like (but there are probably mitigations against that).

Country is relevant because country = the territory of a particular government, and government is the institution that enforces rights.
Rights exist no matter where you are, but there is no magical way to get people to respect them. That's why we have to have government. Which, in turn, is why we have to have countries.
I agree that it's not obvious what it means for a country to "belong to everybody." What I mean is that it's proper for everyone to be able to go there, and to have their rights respected and enforced. (Potentially only if they pay some minimal amount of taxes. Freedom isn't free.)


Well, if I'm going to claim that somebody has worked out the finer details, I ought to say who it was, so that interested people can go look up more information.
Of course, AR did not work out all the really fine finer details, but she worked out a lot of the major prerequisites. Like providing a basis in metaphysics and epistemology. And she provided a basic foundation of ethics and politics. Yes, there are many nit picks that can be made and answered, which she didn't take the time to directly answer herself.


I'm not sure I want to take the time to go through all this, but it looks like you're assuming the non-aggression principle out of context. The government doesn't have to obey the non-aggression principle, because it is formed out of a state of nature. To expect everybody to just voluntarily agree to a government is silly.
But once we have a government, we need to make it adhere to the NAP as much as possible, and if it strays too far, overthrow it (assuming a culture capable of supporting something better... which generally is not the case today in most parts of the world).
So, yes, the government should tax, if it _has_ to. Non-taxation is an ideal to strive for, but if you can't achieve it, well, don't throw the baby out with the bath water.
Similarly, if you believe competing defense agencies will just lead to chaos, you have to concede that having a minimal, night watchman government is the best we can do.
I don't think what I'm saying is what AR said, but I think it's a reasonable interpolation. I don't think her system logically falls apart to the typical anarcho-capitalist critiques. My apologies if your critique falls out of that scope.

It will be intersting to see the results, but the bitcoin community is really mixed. There are some very intelligent and highly rational people, and a lot of real numbskulls.
So please be very careful about what conclusions you try to draw from the survey. You won't be able to draw much from it other than what some bitcoin users think, which overall says nothing about the potentially valid uses of bitcoin.

It has proven it, modulo the assumption that users are rational.
In other words, bitcoin will continue to function as it currently does as a way to store wealth indefinitely, unless or until there is a mass panic and crash that is lasting. There is no _rational_ reason for _that_ to happen. The only way it will happen is if it turns out that a significant proportion of bitcoins are owned by people who don't understand bitcoin well and are prone to panic.

My question was just a rhetorical one to make a point, but I wish I had thought to actaully ask the question you are answering. Fascinating!
So, you have explained why adding a decimal place would require doing something slightly different in implementations that rely on a 64-bit floating point to get around using 64-bit integers. But I'm not sure this is actually a problem at all, in practice. (The official client and bitcoind are in C++, so should get 64 bit ints for free. Otherwise, just use a BigNum implementation. This isn't scientific programming where the performance would be much of an issue, as far as I can tell.)
Also, that can't be the rationale to cap bitcoin at 21 million instead of something else. If that were the rationale, he could have capped it at 90 million. 9 * 10^15 is still less than 2^53 - 1. Is it known what the rationale for 21 million specifically, actually is?

Actually, from that, you could interpret "virtual" to mean "simulating the appearance of a perceptual concerete."
The word "virtual" is pretty problematic, in that it's not used very clearly or consistently in general, but the definition I have given is arguably a useful way to interpret the word, and is probably consonant with how it was originally used.
Under this definition, you could have an image on the computer that constitutes a "virtual house" or "virtual car," since those are normally concrete things that you perceive in the real world. "Virtual money" wouldn't be allowable under this definition, unless it was "Virtual [physical] coins" or "virtual [physical] bills", which is clearly not what we mean when we call bitcoin a "virtual currency."

I think you misunderstood me, but I could have been more clear. I just used China as another example. I'm American, not Chinese.
I'm saying that we all have rights, all over the world.
How do I know? The same way I know that food, clothing, and shelter are good for me. Being free from coersion is in my self-interest, and it's in my self interest for everyone else to be free of coersion, too. And the same is true from your perspective. The only way this isn't true for any person is if their livelihood depends on coercing people, such as government employees (to varying degrees).
Even then, I would argue that it's in their interest to promote the creation of a better system. It's not like those people necessarily would NOT have jobs WITHOUT the government, as there would be more economic opportunity.
And what about someone like Saddam Hussein? Well, it's better to be a regular middle class guy than to be a brutal dictator. As another less extreme example, do you think Barak Obama is happy? I don't think so.
So, in summary, everyone being free of coersion is in everyone's interest, which is the reason it is called a "natural" (or "inalienable") right.
Of course, there are a lot of things assumed in this argument, and a lot of side issues/potential objections that would need to be addressed. But that's been done elsewhere. Ayn Rand did it.
Then the entire libertarian movement started going by ripping off parts of her ideas, and then ultimately the anarcho-capitalists. (There may have been some anarcho-capitalists before that, but there wasn't much of a movement.) And there were historically also classical liberals, like the US Founding Fathers, that had similar ideas, but not as fully fleshed out as what Ayn Rand came up with. For example, they were right to mentioned inalienable rights in the US Declaration of Independence, but attribute human nature, which gives rise to those rights (as I have partially touched on above), to a divine creator.

The difficulty of finding a block would not change at first, so with fewer miners, blocks are no longer found every 10 minutes.
Difficulty is only adjusted every 2016 blocks, which means a chain with almost no hash power would take a very long time to reach a difficulty adjustment.
That being said, a fork could do a unilateral difficulty adjustment to start with. Alternatively (and preferably), if a fork has enough miners, you can limp along for a little while until you reach a difficulty adjustment.

My point is that telling people to act against their own self-interest is counterproductive. You're never goint to get anywhere. If you're going to make an argument, you need to show how it benefits the person you're appealing to. Just citing some moral standard that you haven't justified (and likely can't justify), like the environment or animal welfare, it's going to cut it. The moral standard you need to be citing is human well-being. In particular, the well-being of the person you are appealing to.

In the context of finance, "backing" means something is guaranteed to be automatically redeemable for a specific quantity of something else. In other words, it's a certificate representing whatever is backing the certificate. Bitcoin simply is not backed by anything.


It's not, because regular people constantly ask what bitcoin is "backed by," and bitcoiners constantly give hand-wavy and unconvincing answers that are technically incorrect.

She clearly did not intend "delegate" to include a voluntary delegation on an individual basis; otherwise, her views would be obviously, blatantly contradictory.
I just spent some time looking up "delegate" in dictionaries, and it's simply not true that the use of the word is limited in the way you claim. But even if it were, it would just mean that Ayn Rand misused the word. That would be a simpler explanation than "she's too dumb to see a blatant contradiction."
But again, this is all quibbling over semantics. The overall structure and implications of her arguments are completely clear, and this is just a side issue of no importance.

Yes and no. Mt Gox doesn't deserve a heavy regulatory burden. However, the people of the US "deserve" to live in mud huts, becuase they hold anti-civilization ideas and vote for anti-civilization politicians.
Anyway, I truly wish Mt Gox the best. I have nothing but admiration and respect for innovators. It's just that I have been disappointed with some of their technical and managerial decisions. They need to try to step up their game. I don't know what their constraints are, so I can't really pass judgement on a personal level.

Fiat money is not backed by anything.
In other words, you cannot go to the issuer of fiat money and redeem if for a certain quantity of a commodity (e.g. gold, silver, etc.) at a fixed rate.
The concept of "backing" is a technical concept in finance that requires the above to be true.
I hold both fiat money and bitcoin because I have a rational expectation---not faith---that I will be able to exchange these currencies for goods in the future.

How do you imagine this unfolding? I'm sure you'll agree that replacing one bunch of bad people with another bunch of bad people won't do any good. My opinion is that the US is not capable of having freedom without, first, major cultural change. It's a fact that most Americans today do not want freedom, and many outright hate it.


I don't. So you're just making stuff up here.


I don't know what specific scenario you are proposing yet, but I doubt it's inevitable. We don't know what decisions people will make in the future. It's probably inevitable that the US will suffer a major economic collapse unless radical action is taken quickly by the government to change the way things are going... so almost inevitable. (Because you can't keep printing money and racking up debt indefinitely... the game has to end at some point.) But there's really no telling if that collapse will be next year, or in several decades, or even some time later than that.


Honestly, Pirate Party members have no business "bringing down" the US government, unless the government initiated force against them. Of course, in this case, it was just childish rhetoric, anyway. But yeah, there are good ways to change things, and there are bad ways to change things, and if foreign nationals threaten to destroy the US government, I will defend it. That's not initiating force, it's retaliating.
The bitcoin community needs more reasoned arugment and less teenage drama from anarchists, hippies, nihilists, and other collectivists. We need people that actually support individual rights. So I sometimes call that shit out when I see it. Of course, it's pretty pointless, as this thread demonstrates, so I probably won't do it so much any more. I should have made my "cruise misslie" point in a less direct way, which I realized immediately, and I only didn't change that comment because someone replied to it almost immediately. But the point is the same - you can only defeat force with force.

I think you need to back up every 100 transactions, since the key pool is size 100 and you use one at most one of those addresses for each transaction ( at most one new address when you receieve, and one new change address to send).
Of course, it would be prudent to do it every 80 or 90 transactions, in case you mis-count. (Actually, you should be backing up all your important files regularly.)
I am 99% sure this is right, but since we're talking about _money_ here, hopefully someone else can chime in and confirm.

I was thinking the same thing. I suspect that the devs might actually be willing to include that kind of feature.
EDIT: Well, now that I think about it, I am pretty sure that the devs want to switch to a deterministic wallet, like the one used by Armory, where all subsequent private keys can be mathematically derived from an initial seed number, so you just have to backup the initial seed number (which may just be the first private key, I don't know the details), and you're good for all time. This is a better solution, and should come eventually. Development time would be better spent on this.

Regarding only the wallet issue: A wallet is a collection of Bitcoin private keys. (The public key can be derived from the private key mathematically.)
AFAIK, the wallet also stores any metadata you enter into the client (e.g., if you give an address a label).
The question of why you would want more than one bitcoin address (hence causing a need for a wallet) is more complicated, but we can get into that if you want.
@_date: 2013-10-26 00:27:00
Yes, it's possible. You don't even need a majority of miners to do it. It would just be a permanent fork of the blockchain, i.e., a true fork of the currency.

For ease of use in everyday trade for regular people: Call it microbits and use UBT as the analog to BTC or USD. (a capital U). Normal people don't know the 'micro' symbol (and I don't even know how to type it outside of LaTeX).
"Microbits" is no more cumbersome than "bitcoins," which is essential. Also, people already use "micro" to mean "something small," as opposed to a scientific division (note that Americans don't usually use SI units... so "millibits" is a lot "weirder feeling" in everyday speech for Americans than "microbits", for example).
@_date: 2013-05-10 17:39:09
For any given paper "wallet" (i.e., address), if you spend any coins, you need to spend all of them, becuase most bitcoin software produces "change" that goes to some other address, and you don't want to have to worry about that. In practice, spending all of your paper wallet to an intermediate address is not problematic, it's just one extra transaction you have to make.
If you're using a _deterministic wallet_, like The Armory (which, by the way, does allow you to make a paper backup), you don't have to worry about this issue.

Paul Buchheit recently said that bitcoin is the TCP/IP of finance, and that's a view I share. In other words, for some simple things it's better to just have centralization, and you can build those things on top of bitcoin. For a service like the one we're talking about, the centralization aspect just doesn't matter that much, and it makes it possible to do instant transactions.
I don't think you can get instant (i.e., "atomic") transactions without a centralized system. In other words, if you want to definitively send bitcoins to a merchant instantly, and know that there is no double-spend, I think you have to do something like this. If you have other ideas, let me know.

They can't manipulate its worth, because if they were to flood the market to drive the price down, speculators would swallow up those cheap coins, and the government would then have a smaller pool to play with. Rinse and repeat.

If you think about the process a billionaire would go through to try to control the market, you'll realize that it actually wouldn't work. Probably the vast majority of bitcoins are not even _on_ the market. As the billionaire buys bitcoin, the prices skyrocket, so they waste money. If they dump all their bitcoin, they just became a lot less rich, as prices plummet. If the pattern is predictable, everybody can sell when they buy and buy when they sell, and completely fleece the billionaire.

This is quibbling over the definition of the word "have." Are you a non-native English speaker?
I could just replace every instance of "all people have rights" with "rights are applicable for all people" which just means "a certain set of social rules should be recognized and enforced for all people."
But using the word "have" in this sense is standard in English.

There is no such thing as "controlling" a block. But there is creating (mining) blocks.
If the government had enough hash power to create over 50% of blocks mined over some period of time, they could easily execute double-spend attacks during that period of time. That would make it very hard to use bitcoin, but existing coins would be safe (i.e., could not be stolen). Of course, since bitcoin would be hard to use, their real-world value would decline greatly, until/unless the protocol were changed to make the government's mining hardware obsolete (which is a simple protocol change, technically, but it might be hard to get people to agree on what to change it to).
If the government had a lot of hash power but not 50%, they could still be annoying by mining blocks with no transactions in them. That's not really a deal-breaker, though.

You're asking about the voter enrollment issue, which we already observed isn't subject to improvement. There is no way to determine who is a legitimate voter or not without an authority to determine that.
However, it _is_ potentially possible to find out if all the votes have been tallied correctly... which is a big improvement over what exists now in practice and probably competitive with, if not better than, Chaum's voting scheme (don't recall the name, but each person gets to vote 3 times in such a way that 2 votes cancel each other out).

You can have various specializations, but I think that's a distraction from the real issue.
Ultimately, there is no reason for larger defense organizations to allow smaller ones to continue to exist in their territory, so they won't. They will either fight them, or subsume them into their organization under threat of force.
No two defense organizations will stay "equal" for too long, so eventually, the above scenario will always happen.
Since two defense forces fighting each other will make both much weaker, they will be motivated to simply join together into one organization rather than fighting.
So you just end up with a bunch of smaller states (or, potentially, eventually, one large state).
It will be in citizens' self-interest to support the largest defense organization, becuase if there is a disagreement between two organizations about, say, how (or whether) someone should be punished, the larger organization will get its way.
Ultimately, it's in everyone's self-interest to just work towards a shared minimal government.
The reason that competition works in a free market is because government bars the use of force. If you don't bar the use of force, you can have competition, as anarcho-capitalists claim, but it will be violent competition.
In a truly free market, no matter how large one company gets, it can never "take over" or have a true monopoly, because someone else can always start competing, and the large company is not allowed to use force against the smaller one. In anarchism, the larger defense companies will take over and form monopolies, because they _can_ use force against competitors.

Austraila should establish a federal prison in the UK and start sending all its convicts there.
Seriously, would be hilarious. The Aussie parliament should do it for the historical troll value alone. If I could vote for this, I would. It wouldn't require more than a tiny fraction of a tax increase.

It would be better to just use a centralized service that lets you transfer bitcoins atomically and instantly from one account to another. (Probably some of the existing wallet services provide this, but I haven't tried them... can someone update me on this?)
You and the merchant have to trust the centralized service not to steal your bitcoins or go down... which isn't much of a problem. Just don't keep more bitcoins there than you would in actual physical wallet that you carry around with you.

**The word "backed" has a specific meaning. Bitcoin isn't automatically redeemable for something else, so it's not backed by anything.** This is also true of most commodities, including gold. People need to stop making hand-wavy and, ultimately, incorrect arguments about Bitcoin being "backed" by "belief" or "utility." Other people can tell that such arguments are hand-wavy, so overall, it doesn't serve to build confidence in bitcoin.
Bitcoin's value is propped up by people's belief that other people will continue trading it for other things of value in the future. In particular, speculators.
**This is a reasonable belief**, but only because bitcoin has properties that make it **uniquely useful for certain kinds of trade and wealth storage.** That makes it reasonable to believe that it will continue to be in high demand well into the future.
tl;dr it it not "backed" by anything, its value is propped up by speculators.

The real reason we have a right to bitcoin crypto keys is because by using them, we are not initiating force against anyone (or threatening to do so).
People need to stop conflating free speech with all other rights. Doing so weakens them all.
For example, a blueprint for a nuclear bomb isn't covered by free speech, just because it's written down. Neither is a plan for a terrorist attack.
If you want to insist that _any_ data is covered by free speech, you are just making people less clear about the true philosophical justification of free speech, which will hasten the day in which that right is no longer protected.
Like having crypto keys, the true, fundamental justification of free speech is that it is not initiating force against anyone. Therefore, yelling "Fire" in a crowded theatre, and the other examples I already gave, are (rightfully) not covered by free speech.

Bitcoin has already proven its use as a way to store wealth. If that's all it's ever used for, it'll be a huge success.

Bitcoin has no official "core dev team." (In a sense it does, but by what authority are they the official core dev team? Under no authority.) Anyone can patch the software. What makes one set of patches more official than any other? Nothing.
All that matters is: Which block chain are you and I going to do our trading on?
(And, more generally, of all the people using block chains claiming to be bitcoin, how many are using which chain, and what is the market value of coins on each chain?)
Fortunately, right now, this is totally uncontroversial, and not even an issue, and I hope it stays that way indefinitely.
But if the core dev team does something that I feel violates the core principles of bitcoin, such as lift the 21 million cap, I personally will cease to recognize their chain as legitimate, and so will many other people.
We could end up with "Bitcoin-A" and "Bitcoin-B," for example.
Just as we can have an unlimited number of alt coins. The only difference is, those chains claim to not be bitcoin and have a separate genesis block.
Sorry if this strayed into the overly pedantic. I didn't intend to come across as giving a lecture on stuff you probably very well already know. But I also didn't want to give insufficient explanation to make my point clear.

Correct. "Currency" is already an abstraction, not something with a physical presense. So bitcoin is an actual currency.
In contrast, WoW gold is a "virtual currency," for the same reason that buildings and land in WoW are "virtual."
When people use WoW gold for real-world transactions, it is a virtual currency that is being used as a real currency. Same with Linden Dollars.
It may be helpful to note that "virtual" means "simulating something that is real." Bitcoin is not a simulation of anything else.

In general, there's nothing wrong with the environment.
The sea level rising a few inches in a few hundred years and mild warming in northern latitudes (which acutally _helps_ by making them amenable to humans living there and farming) just isn't a problem.
The kind of heavy regulation the environmentalist movement calls for will just result in a much lower standard of living for everyone (which is what they want).
In fact, the goal of the intellectual leaders of the movement isn't even about "balancing" the "needs of the environment" with human life. It's just about self-sacrifice. If you want evidence, look at their ardent opposition to nuclear, which is the safest, cleanest, most efficient way to produce power.
Professional enrivonmentalists are just philosophical nihilists who hate those who have and hold jobs.
But yeah, maybe it was just a one-off thing, so I'm not going to prejudge you, but it's interesting that your response was to just bash me, instead of intellectually defending your position.

No. The second part just translates so the first part, plus "... and the government should (a) respect this and (b) back me up on it if someone violates it."
The purpose of conceptualizing rights is to figure out the proper role of the government.
I don't really love the "right to life" phrase, because it's not obvious (to me) precisely what it refers to. It's somewhat open to interpretation. Some of the interpretations are right, some are wrong. But there is a right to physical property, for example, and that's less ambiguous.

"objectivist philosophy" does not really mean anything in this context unless the author means "Objectivist philosophy," the philosophy of Ayn Rand, which is a proper noun, or "objective philosophy."
Neither of which actually make much sense in this context, since most people reject the notion of objective philosophy (except Objectivists), and Objectivists are pretty rare and not particularly involved with Bitcoin.
Maybe this construction would make more sense in French or Russian (looking at the author's bio here). If so, I'd be interested to hear the explanation!

Lots of foreigners hate America for its success.
We haven't invaded Europe (except to help save them in the past). We invaded a country run by the Taliban and a country run by Saddam Hussein. I think it was incredibly stupid of us, because it wasted trillions of _our_ dollars, and thousands of lives. So it hurt America. But it didn't really hurt those countries much, because anything is no worse than Saddam Hussein or the Taliban. Those countries were already brutal hellholes where a human life was worth 0 because every life belongs to either Saddam or Allah's representatives on Earth, and so they remain.
So, there is no real reason for Europeans to posture about "taking down" America. We haven't really done anything to them. They like doing it because it makes them feel big.

Studies have shown that InTrade (the main fiat prediction market) is extremely good at predicting things. That can be useful information.
Moreover, you can literally use a prediction market as a hedge against risk. To give a simple example, if you are a farmer and bad weather can wipe out your crops, you can hedge your risk by buying shares that pay out if bad weather occurs. (To fully understand this example, you may have to go and learn about the mathematics behind prediction markets.)
That's not a great example since farmers already have ways to hedge risk, but prediction markets can be a good way to hedge risk in areas where it currently isn't easy to do so. In this regard, you can think of it like Kickstarter for insurance.
I think there are probably a lot of applications for prediction markets that haven't even even been explored yet. For example, reputation markets have been written about in science fiction. A reputation market would allow someone to trade on my reputation, making it possible for lenders to better judge the risk in lending to me and also to hedge the risk of a default. I'm not sure if that particular idea would pan out in exactly that way, but the point is that prediction markets can be treated as low-level mechanisms that other things can be built on top of.
@_date: 2013-07-12 20:23:42
Prediction markets can be extremely useful to individual people and humanity in general. They provide an excellent way to manage risk on the one hand, and incentivize the development of highly specialized knowledge on the other hand.
I yearn for the day when I can pick up the newspaper (or other mainstream news source) and see prediction market quotes just like I can now for stocks. That world is more quantified, smarter, better world.
I hope the creator(s) of this site will keep all this in mind and play the long game. For instance, please try to keep your focus more on things like economics, business, politics, global events, the weather, etc., and less on things like sports betting (though I think it's fine to offer that, too, if you can get away with it legally).

If you're asking that question seriously, you should go read about the mechanics of prediction markets.
You literally could not (reasonably) have a prediction market offering shares in its own demise, because those shares wouldn't be redeemed (by definition) if the prediction market were to go bust!
Now, if we have a healthy ecosystem of prediction market sites, they could offer shares in one another's demise, which would greatly increase the utility of the whole system. But that's asking a bit much, since we can't even get a healthy ecosystem of bitcoin exchanges (although admittedly, that is a much harder problem).

I'm pretty certain a "double-spend" with one confirmation on each of the two spends can happen very easily by accident (on the part of miners, not on the part of the spender). All it requires is two miners to each produce a block at roughly the same time. Each miner probably saw both spends, but rejected one as a double-spend, and accepted the other. However, if they accepted _different_ spends...
Maybe there is some protection against this somewhere in the transaction protocol? e.g. if a miner sees a potential double spend, reject _both_ transactions? (Obviously, the miner would be free to actuall follow such a rule, or not.) If anyone with more knowledge than me can weight in, that would be great.

In fact, having more money will give you more flexibility in your life, and more access to more good things.
If having more money makes someone unhappy, they need to see a therapist and fix that problem, not decide to have less money.

@_date: 2013-08-25 15:53:37


Your notion that rarity creates value by itself is much more silly than the notion you are dismissing.
My belief is that bitcoin's value comes from people's willingness to trade it for things of value because they anticipate that other people will continue doing that into the forseeable future. Which makes sense because bitcoin is useful for trade and for storing value in unique ways that aren't met by anything else.
@_date: 2013-05-01 17:55:35


No, I'm being serious, not just casually dismissing everything.


Is there any conceivable system that can detect that? I don't think so. That's a different problem. With Bitcoin, at least you can see that _your_ vote is counted, which AFAIK is the best any other system has devised (and also better than what is currently used anywhere in practice).
You may even be able to devise a way around this problem. For example, you could require that people vote in order to receive government services, but they are allowed to cast a "vote" for "null." Then, you know all the votes should tally to close to 100% of eligible voters, no more, no less. But that particular suggestion is extemporaneous and probably a better one could be devised.

The theory-practice divide goes all the way back to Plato, who asserted that only the world of ideas mattered, and the material world was not important. Christianity picked that up and ran with it. It was great for them.
The fact is, ideas are only helpful if they help you live a happier life. But only ideas that are connected to reality (i.e., true) help do that. But you can't get along very well without having good ideas (because otherwise you are just recycling other peoples' wrong ideas).

I personally usually disagree with you but I think you are right, here. There is no such thing as "intrinsic value," and that is just confusing.
A better way for people to say what they want to say is: a quantity of gold has non-financial uses; a unit of bitcoin has only financial uses.
(You can say the blockchain has non-financial uses, e.g. using colored coins as smart access tokens or something, which is true, but that is decoupled from bitcoin as a currency.)

You can supervise distributing bitcoin votes in the same way you do paper ballots, i..e, one official from each party (or, at least, some large number of the parties) observes each time a ballot/satoshi is transfered to a voter, to make sure it's a legitimate voter that receives it and that the voter hasn't already gotten a vote. 
It's fortunate that Spain has so many parties that supervise the elections. In the US, we only have two parties that I know for sure can participate in election supervision, though I think there are more nuances (e.g. I think you can have "neutral" election officials which could, in theory, come from one of the other very small parties that we have). Anyway, lots of countries are in a similar situation to the US. There was just a highly contested election in Venezuela, for example.

No. You have speculators to thank for the fact that bitcoin has a price above 1 penny. Speculators play a central role in bootstrapping a new currency. Without them, it would literally be impossible.
People complain that bitcoin isn't "backed by" anything. Actually, in a less technical sense, it is "backed by" speculators. You can always get your &lt;insert currency here&gt; back out of bitcoin, because speculators establish a floor (albeit one that moves) on the value of bitcoin.

"Every revolution has a counterrevolution" is not true. It is not a valid philosophical generalization. So don't use that as a premise in your thinking.
It sounds like something that would come from Marx, with his material dialectic, but I can't say for sure.
But your basic question has value.
Do I think the US government will try to heavily regulate bitcoin? Absolutely, they already do. We have to pay taxes, just like with any financial security, and must comply with money laundering laws (e.g. Know Your Customer). And bitcoin businesses have to pay high taxes, just like amost all US businesses.
Do I think the US government will regulate it to death for use by law-abiding Americans, or outright ban it? Definitely a real possibility.
Can they stop it all over the world? Probably not. I have heard it argued that the world trade organization and UN could get together to attempt to completely ban it everywhere, but I doubt that will happen. Even a few small countries making heavy use of it would be interesting.

What would those changes be? I don't know what they could do except have a contract directly with a large mining pool that allows them to route transactions directly to the pool and have them included in a block.

The word "backed" has a specific meaning in a financial context. It means that a certificate is guaranteed (by some authority) to be redeemable for a fixed quantity of something else, such as a precious metal.
This is not the case for bitcoin, so it's not backed by anything.
People need to stop making hand-wavy and, ultimately, incorrect arguments about Bitcoin being "backed" by "belief" or "utility" or "math." Other people can tell that such arguments are hand-wavy and/or faulty, so overall, it doesn't serve to build confidence in bitcoin.
Bitcoin's value is propped up by speculators' belief that other people will continue trading it for other things of value in the future. That is a reasonable belief because bitcoin has properties that make it **uniquely useful** for certain kinds of trade and wealth storage.

So should all kinds of financial securities be permitted and non-regulated under free speech laws, because at their lowest level, they are a written agreement between two consenting parties? Clearly, this (and all kinds of similar) arguments are not going to fly, although all kinds of financial securities _should_ be permitted and non-regulated. This point should be argued on a more solid basis than free speech, which is not solid in this case because it is a mistaken basis to argue from.
What about writing something into a contract that is fraudulent? In this case, the point is that free speech is contextual - it doesn't mean you can say _anything_. So, you shouldn't reduce something to free speech when there is a better argument for it being unregulated somewhere else.

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they just slowly let themselves go out of business. I mean, their website hasn't even changed in what seems like years (and may actually be that long).
Of course, even just coasting on inertia, they might be able to stay in business for a LONG time, since their service is desperately needed and nobody wants to try to compete with them due to the regulatory threat.

In reality, it varies at the local level, so there's a ton of variation across the entire country.
I'm sure there are places where elections officials are alone (with other elections officials) with the ballots.
Anyway, it's a huge country, with only two parties that have any power at all, and many areas lean extremely heavily to one party or another.
So there are many opportunities for corruption, and there is not that much reason to be trusting of elections officials.
Still, voting is highly decentralized (from the perspective of looking at the entire country), so there is that.

You're missing the forest for the trees. You can't use some out-of-context quotes to claim that someone is completely horrible. Was Hitler evil because he slapped his wife? Are firemen heroic and brave because they will rescue a kitten stuck in a tree?
To address the specifics:
(1) There was no genocide against American indians. Those that cooperated with the whites were integrated in with white society. Those that made war, the favor was returned to them. To equate what happened with Native Americans to genocide is to slander the American settlers and to make the word "genocide" completely meaningless.
(2) Only four words here, that is not enough for me to get any meaning from.
(3) This is clearly a joke. Rush is probably in favor of trustworthy Western countries having nukes, as I am. If you want to address his intellectual position, address it.
(4) Clearly a joke. And don't even try to argue that he was being literal. He's not. The actual roots of feminism are much more damning to feminism than that, and Rush knows that.
tl;dr you not addressing the intellectual issues Rush espouses, but instead trying to pick on him via minor non-essential details. This is blatantly irrational, and also common liberal behavior that gives you all a bad name. You resort to these petty non-essentials because the truth is not on your side, and/or because dealing with it is beyond your intellectual capability.

Thanks for sharing this, but unfortunately, I don't know enough about SMPC to really comment on most of it. I really liked what I did understand, with the exception of the following part:


I think that this is unreasonable in practice. For example, the FBI has no authority over election matters, much less the EFF. And what if the election authorities come up with a list of participants, and [insert some popular group] isn't included?
Anyway, the bitcoin voting scheme (it's pretty obvious how it would work, but I just did a long and specific write-up in another branch of this thread if you're curious exactly how it would work) could also have voter lists pre-published and pre-agreed-upon by cooperating organizations (which, in practice, in the US, would be the GOP, the Democrat Party, and any third parties). So that's actually not a bad idea, but it's not specific to your scheme, either.
The major downside of the bitcoin voting scheme (at least, as I've written it down; it's likely somebody else has already thought of possible aways around this) is that you can retroactively prove who you voted for. There are definitely ways aroud that, but I haven't thought of a _good_ way around it at this point.
