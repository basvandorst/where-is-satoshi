Why is it that every sob story in thid sub is made by an account that is just created?
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:51:01
Okay seriously with the self promotion man, this particular video is absolutely not news and doesnt tell us anything new. At this point it just feels like you are attention whoring for tips.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:01:44
Or you can act like any regular rational person and just answer them nicely instead of lashing out like a nasty neckbeard? Maybe this way they will be less likely to harass you in the future?

Dude this is a subreddit about bitcoins not about begging
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:52:27
a time in your life aka 2 hours ago?
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:06:46
It seems as though if you run into any prpblems at all, you are screwed
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:41:28
lol, account created 2 minutes ago and message reads like a nigerian prince scam
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:24:01
I don't think you know what "fact" means.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:16:22
You're the one in the wrong here

@_date: 2013-12-03 08:10:42
redditor for 3 hours, someone has been creating accounts for the last few hours and just spamming sob stories to try to get charity
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:53:57
You mined 2 bitcoins using a graphics card? Doubtful.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:25:03
I know I'm the bad guy here, but this subreddit needs to stop being a charity.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:34:08
seriously another just created account begging for bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:28:14
So why exactly did you include your QR code in this photo?
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:14:42
Lol account for less than an hour
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:41:14
As rest of OP's posts have to do with him being dirt poor, I surely believe that any funds OP raises will "go out to others"
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:26:52
Did you use google translate to type out this title?
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:21:29
You seriously need to calm down and stop acting as though "ZE BANKS" took your firstborn. Also, the teller on the other end of the call should not be part of whatever neckbeard vendetta you have on the system. Please dust the cheeto dust off your fingers
