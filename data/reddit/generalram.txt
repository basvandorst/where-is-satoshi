Around 150 iirc.

We (England) are actually exploring Bitcoin and although the banks don't like it too much atm the government seem very enthusiastic about it -
@_date: 2014-10-31 13:32:26
Erm... Banking in the UK is free? The only accounts you pay for is ones that offer insurance/car breakdown etc.

MtGox ran it's trading engine iirc. Which wasn't up to the task....
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:55:57
BitStamp buddy!
@_date: 2013-10-07 12:21:49
I'm sure he'll be able to get a very nice plea deal with that sort of money.....
@_date: 2013-03-12 14:27:48
Just managed to buy 3 coins at $31.28 each (at least aorund there, I bought in GBP), as soon as I did it went back up to 40 odd $ a coin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:56:45
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:08:51
Shut up, I'll sell when I want to.
@_date: 2013-04-16 09:48:11
Pointless buying now as everyone will be on there buying coins pushing the price up.
@_date: 2013-03-12 20:35:08
Just as I replied to you, it actually confirmed - typical :P
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:13:19
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:51:35
This time I think you might be wrong. There seems to be a head and shoulders pattern emerging in the charts. I'm pulling my money out for the time being (and making a profit).
If I am wrong and it keeps going up I can buy back in with a slight dent in my profit.
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:03:01
Well said, there WILL be a big ass crash soon. May not be tomorrow, it may not be next month. But there will be one and a lot of people will lose some money.
The only winners will the people that got in Pre-March. Or the lucky people &gt;March that sold just at the right time.
@_date: 2013-03-12 14:32:02
I bought them though Blockchain, only good place I could find for us UK'ers to get some coins (I am new to this, so probably don't know what I am talking about).
Paid £63.63 and received 2.9644 coins.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:10:07
Yep it sure is. Should just let the economy take it's course IMO instead of trying to prop it up with chewing gum and duct tape.
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:42:48
It's because a lot of peoples deposit has gone into Bitstamp today (including mine) - I however, are waiting for the price to drop below $50 before I spend it.
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:43:51
I am just going to play it safe I reckon, I have made £300 profit in the last week alone doing this, if I keep selling and buying I minimise my risk but yet still make a profit. 
I think there will be a big mental barrier at $100 - that will be the first proper test I think.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:49:51
Either buy off people on localbitcoins.com (keep an eye out for me on there - BillboTor) or buy some from blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-03-12 20:49:07
It didn't when I posted this.... Just sods law as soon as I do the confirmation came through!
Didn't think I was being over eager with waiting 408 minutes for my first confirmation. Guess I was....
@_date: 2013-04-17 09:02:40
I buy and sell on LocalBitcoins through their escrow service. I only deal with Bank Transfers as they can't be charged back. Never had a problem and I buy/sell my coins within 10 minutes.
@_date: 2013-03-12 15:08:56
Thanks for the explanation :), not going to be investing a lot (probably got about £100 invested at the minute), mostly done it for some Silk Road purchases, but as the market etc being how it is at the minute, decided to buy some for a bit of fun :)
Over the last week I have bought 4.5 bitcoins. Current value is 133.96 according to my BlockChain wallet, I have only spent about around £90-£100. Quite happy as I am still learning how things work, need to find an easy way to cash out rather then go through MtGox though - international payments seem to cost a bomb.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:03:18
That's what essentially the UK have been doing with printing more money to stop us going tits up.
@_date: 2013-08-05 09:54:52
I don't see how this is legal in the UK. It is legal to have a fake ID in the UK - but only of a fictional place. Driving Licenses etc are not fictional.
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:19:20
Buy through Bank Transfer on there? Don't have to meet locally buddy.
@_date: 2013-03-12 20:20:25
Yep left on Blockchain's standard setting
@_date: 2013-09-15 11:53:59
They're a scam. Why people still buy from them I do not know.
@_date: 2013-03-12 20:20:11
I bought the coins directly through Blockchain via bank transfer. Fee settings etc left on default
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:00:33
Can't you just link it to a currency like Silk Road does? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:00:50
Yeah and it would become worthless. Everyone would move to Litecoin - no currency moving = no value. 
It would never happen for exactly this reason.
@_date: 2013-07-18 17:46:25
Well replying to Tweets first also gives the company PR, so I can see why some do.
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:48:03
Make a block chain paper wallet. You'll be fine then. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 08:35:59
I'm just laughing that people are STILL buying from these frauds, one day they'll just shut up shop and do a runner! 
I feel sorry for the people that first pre-ordered with them but all I am seeing is that they haven't delivered on their promises AT ALL. Why are people still ordering from them?!
@_date: 2013-09-15 11:31:25
Well they do seem to be the worst company in the world.
@_date: 2013-03-17 21:22:20
So you're saying a Bitcoin will be worth $100?! How likely is this?
Being honest though, I have no clue with what you just said!
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:33:19
Certainly did, I sold all mine the day before as it was beginning to scare me with how fast it was rising!
 I'd rather have proper cash than upvotes anyway :P How about yourself, managed to dodge the storm?
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:56:13
I'm buying in when it hits 400...
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:19:19
How many tickles does it take to make an Octopus laugh?
TEN TICKLES!
@_date: 2013-04-16 09:39:38
Same with mine, just waiting for the price to drop below $50 and I'll buy.
@_date: 2013-03-12 15:13:59
Cheers mate, can understand why that moves so quick now!
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:17:10
Exactly what I am doing now, cashed out everything 24 hours before the crash and now waiting for my funds to enter Bitstamp....
@_date: 2013-03-12 20:26:07
I think this is it? 
Just as I posted that, I got one confirmation! Sods law eh? I thought I was being patient for more then 6 hours?!
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:37:42
I just use localbitcoins or blockchain.info - seems to work pretty well.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:08:29
He can't spend it if nobody wants it. It's like me creating a new coin now - lets call it GeneralRamCoin. I have got them all - I price them at $50 each. Who'll want them? Nobody.
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:49:51
Wow, very quick for you man! Mine got sent Thursday - they've had a lot of backlog with switching bank accounts and that so I guess a lot of people got processed today.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:59:56
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:09:13
If it goes to below $240.... Pull out. Sitting at $245 atm.
@_date: 2013-09-15 12:35:16
At least you get what you pay for....
@_date: 2013-03-12 14:34:37
I don't understand how it can fluctuate so suddenly and back up again though (As soon as my payment was complete it was back to normal). Any ideas?
