Nobody thinks crypto is the "largest bubble in history." The only person I've seen say anything remotely close to this is Mike Novogratz, and he said it *will be* the biggest bubble ever. Maybe that's what you're thinking of. 
It's not a matter of opinion. With a market cap of $500 billion, it's not even close to the largest bubble in history. In fact, it would be the smallest bubble in history if $500 billion was the top.

I'm not trying to get involved in the debate, but I was surprised to learn Andreas wasn't completely loaded. Why is that?

Regarding the “playing with house money” bit, I understand the logic behind it but I don’t like to think of it that way. Once you gain from an investment, it’s *your* money. If you start thinking of it as someone else’s money (even if it’s just a metaphor), you’re more likely to make bad decisions with it. It’s your money. You earned it through good investing.

But the NYSE is just one exchange.

Ahhh this is amazing. I was just looking for something like this.

What's that in Schrute bucks?
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:11:59
Yeah, they can't just up and change their business model. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:11:36
Agree. I don't think you can go wrong with either. They both seem to do the same thing, for the most part.

I understand the point. It's just a bad one. Saying keys are compromised because they've been digitized, but physical copies aren't, is ridiculous because it completely ignores that a paper copy of keys can be stolen or copied.

Pretty high.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:52:03
By that logic, it's compromised if you write it down because someone can steal the paper. The only true safe way would be to memorize them I guess.

Did BCH make it worse?

The most interesting thing is how there does appear to be a correlation with gold now.

Oh we're comparing stocks to cryptocurrencies now? Sure thing, bud.

At the moment of the fork, the two chains are identical.

Well, it was originally a typo for “holding,” right? I always assumed it was pronounced similarly. Not sure how to spell it phonetically, but maybe: Hoe-dling.
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:12:54
That was hilarious, but I don’t like how he pronounced it.

Mostly it's only the strip hotels that rip you off with 6:5 blackjack.

Well, we can't own other people anymore. So there's that.

People with large amounts of cash (millions) don't keep it in bank accounts. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:33:39
Well, exactly how much are we talking? ��
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:55:21
Usually short term treasuries or short term treasury funds.

I think you need to adjust your tinfoil hat.
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:32:27
If you have millions in cash, treasuries are safer than a bank.
