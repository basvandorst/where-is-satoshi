It's not really a drive.... It is a wallet and it has to be used with wallet software on the computer to work.

At the very least,  informed public discourse creates accountability and possible information for any official inquiry.

Phantom money came in hard during December.... Of course, plebs jumped in and multiplied the effect to the rediculously high peak. Then, phantom money is bled back out, but slower, over a couple of months to keep steady downward pressure.... Plebs panic, price crashes. It's like a replay of the silver crash, but this time the crash itself is the goal of the dark money.

The plebs saw the growth that dark money brought in December and multiplied the effect. Price fall was engineered on the blueprint of the silver crash. Won't matter, shits not going away. Economies will be restructured, old money parasites will lose in the end.

Visa/mastercard are payment processors. It's the banks that are instantly obsolete for storage, and quickly losing relevance for some types of credit.  Visa/Mc can just become crypto payment facilitators, making crypto payment instant, safe, and easy for a fee. Many consumers can't handle keys, and many merchants will pay a couple points for access to that market.

tether is only a 2b market cap. less than 1% when the price dropped. It's not tether. take the whole 2b out and you'd still have BTC &gt; 10k
