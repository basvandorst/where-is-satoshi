If the people are not hostile but coöperatieve with each other , they can help each other out with Free labor to ensure the Bare basic needs are met for the " community " in the begining . Of course since  its in their best interest also but afterwards as we "try to tame and manipulatie  the environment we get more trading going on i guees . Can offline transactions Work then with bitcoin to facilitate trade ? And afterwards imagine by Some miracle you are Found you only have to update the wallet the Chain continues , No ?

Hahahaha sorry about That i only reachred season 1 or 2 xD .  Hmmm so Lets say we create a sort of smartphone lan p2p network and  i used ethereum  to create a cryptocurrench   and i ask everyone to mine through their smartphone's CPU in a Sense  , to ensure transaction validity and to prevent double spending .   That way people could trade no ? It would be medium of Exchange and it would hold value like bitcoin but only in the local area netwerk on the island . What are your thaughts ?
