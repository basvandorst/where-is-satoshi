Go away. You are annoying and know nothing about me.  Your a typical internet troll.  Good luck

nah. Never filled out the phishing scam. I blew out of Crypsty and dont have my coins there anyway.  Just saying....where there is smoke there is fire and Crypsty probably going to go under bc they do not make any statements to the issues ppl are having.  Good luck out there

I have experienced no issues really. They do say "snowed in" with the recent acquisitions they made but overall quick.

LOL...what you describe is a "climbing the wall of worry"   ...but with Commodities...ALL COMMODITES.....being the inputs that run the economy......those markets are telling you whats going to happen....no demand = soft commodity prices......then you have leverage and DEBT up the wazoo on bank balance sheets (never mind the balloon of debt on emerging markets) and now almost ...negative interest rates......HHHHAHAHHA.  As for your theor y that "'16 is the MOST forecasted crash in history....hence it wont happen"  Tells me.....you are a perma bull and probalby didnt see 2008 coming and you dont see how obvious this one is. The FED and every other government is out of "bullets" ...wages are down....there is NO gas in the tank fella.  2016 the stock market will be almost cut in half and I will be there to say "told ya so"..while you're getting your butt kicked. I love these permabulls.....so funny. I also can tell you probably have ZERO trading desk experience at a big bank...if you do ...god help us.  LOL

what do you mean?

I am an ex-HF trader....I been saying the stock market could be down -40% in 2016 since the summer of 2015. I believe its a "no brainer".  China will be a disaster.  BTC, etc should fly upwards 
THIS IS NOT ADVICE.  Just an opinion.

SPX 1200 I think is where it stops.  Then re-evaluate.

Where would one put their dough to get yield if not crypto?   Under the mattress?

NICELY SAID. no ammo.   These master planners have painted everyone into a corner. They are CLUELESS how markets work. Just clueless and there is NO UPSDIE for Yellen and people like that to tell us truthful things like "we are FUBAR" because then everyone panics. Look at BAC....huge debt exposure to oil loans and emerging markets.....went from $17 this summer to $11....hahahahah.  BAC has the most exposure on wall street to debt and they keep telling everyone "we are fine"....umm..your stock price says you are NOT fine.
