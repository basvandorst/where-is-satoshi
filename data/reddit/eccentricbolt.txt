Same here.  Using safari on iOS 7.something

I've nowhere near enough BTC to buy that, buy if I did, I would get your work in a heartbeat!  Great job!  You should repost to if you haven't already.

Wow, $3800 seems ridiculously expensive for a board for a month.  Here in the USA, you can rent a 14'x48' (4.26m x 14.6m) for about $300 in more rural settings or around $1000 a month closer to cities.

That's rude.  Would you ask somebody how much money they have in their bank?
Edit: Give me more downvotes, bitches!
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:17:07
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.  Wait for another dip, then double down.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:22:15
Likewise.  Cheers, and enjoy the ride!

Not sure why you're being downvoted for a real question.  
In truth, it's anybody's guess when this upward trend is going to change and "pop".  I've heard/read speculations anywhere between $500 (passed that) and $1000 (it's possible), and then prices "normalizing" to anywhere between $100 (seems a little low) and $400.  Personally, I think it will correct to about $250 or so each. 
Of course, this is all speculation, but I'll tell you this: BTC is doing much better (short term) than any stock I own.

I know I'm late to the party here, but is there a place I can download his discussion?  I can't seem to find it.  Thanks in advance.

Set up your own account (coinbase.com works well), then go [here]( click on the links, and each one will give you a fraction of a penny.  It will take a while to get anything worth anything.
As said by mining is not going to get you anywhere, especially with a "sub-par" computer.  The days of easy mining are over.
When you get some BTC, at coinbase you have the option to sell and the funds will be in your bank in 2 days (give or take).
Good luck, and welcome to the ride!

True.  I just think QR codes look neat.

IIRC, unless you pay with a credit card, it takes 4 days.  Something to do with how long an ACH transaction takes.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:24:04
Yep.  I'd be waiting for my optimal buy-in (even more) price.  As would many others.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:37:27
You're a better person than I was at 15 years of age.  I'd tip you if I could. 
You're going far in life, kid.  Keep being a good person and good things will come to you.
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:48:15
Stay strong.  It will rebound.

When you're near the bottom, there's only one way to go.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:54:15
I'd be interested in a belt buckle (say 3"x3") if the price was right.  I'd like to see a sample of the work and the finish.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:15:24
You would have 1btc worth $200.  Unless you buy today, then you would get what ever the price is Friday (see their note on their "buy" page).  There is a term for this, but I can't recall what it is.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:39:22
No.  This sub-reddit is not for begging.  Go to @_date: 2013-12-26 18:38:59
Good luck to you.  Next time I'm in the market for a new firearm, I'll be sure to look at your website.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:18:46
If and when it does, I'd buy him his own bitcoin.  I find that people tend to be non-believers until they actually own one. ;)
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:39:07
Or vice versa?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:16:23
Exactly. For every person that panic sells when the price starts dropping, there are two people waiting to pick up those coins.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:52:34
I don't think they would make any money that way...
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:25:39
I believe it is (normally) within a few days, but with the frenzy right now, it could take a few more.  The instant authentication where you give your bank login and password only took a few minutes, if that, for me.  I opened a separate account at a new bank just for bitcoins, if you're worried about giving out your password.  Also, if you're able to do the instant one, you can just change your password after it is authenticated.

Unless you do it at work overnight and you don't have to pay the electric bill.
