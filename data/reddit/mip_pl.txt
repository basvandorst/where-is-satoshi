I realize, but the dotted green line is just a trend line (poorly traced, it should start on 2012 low and be a bit steeper btw), and the price does not have to follow it in pixel-by-pixel. 
See it this way: it took 2 years to recover the level of 2011 ATH, and 3 years to recover the price of 2014 ATH. When you apply the same timegap to 2018 ATH, you fly to 2020 (optimistic) or 2021 (pesimistic) to see again $20k prices.
Of course this pace can hasten for whatever external reason, and then stretch to only 1 year time as you say. But this is not what happened in the past.

Don’t think that because you can point out some similarities with the fall of Greece that we will follow their footsteps to the end. I have faith in my country and my countrymen. There is no challenge Romans cannot overcome, our political system is structured in a way that welcomes chaos. You see a polarized country, I see a system that’s working as intended. Some of you don’t believe that Rome is the model for the future because of all the problems you see on the surface but I believe you don’t see the vision.
