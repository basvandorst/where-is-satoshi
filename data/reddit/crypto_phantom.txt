Sending money first to a person to get money later from the same person clearly sounds like a scam to me.

Rigby speaks for me, but I know it will come back.

No problem, I am here to be helpful to people I don't know in real life. I lurked for a long time until I saw someone being bullied on Reddit to give them support.

In my ERP system, the accounting would be automated if it was treated as a foreign currency. It is more awkward as an Other Asset in U.S. GAAP.

About 20 years from now.

Take a long view and give it a few years. No need to stress now. Look at the  price history of BTC over the many years. This is not a new to BTC speculation. You believe in the future of BTC or you don't.

I would buy them, too. I already own BTC for those who think my comment is negative.

No one said all the way to zero.

BTC could drop to near zero in value; it is a risk

This guy is wrong in my opinion. I am looking at a commercial, private blockchain solution for intercompany reconciling. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:54:04
It's great that you want to buy bitcoin. It can be tricky.
It can depend on what country you are from.  You can send me a message I will will help.

The point is that the chart does not include the risk of a quick and massive decrease in value of BTC relative to Gold. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:04:13
You make a good point. I am looking for elements in blockchain technology like decentralized trust, proof that transaction is mutually agreed before confirming the next transaction, etc.

You do not have a right to use coinbase: it is a private service you can choose to use or not use.

No, it is counter to the argument presented in the article. Most people are lining up on one side or the other. My opinion supports the freedom of a private company, Coinbase,  to operate in way that protects them. People have the option to support them or take their business elsewhere.

Three entities approve the next block. They are the sender of goods, the receiver of goods and an auditor.
I am giving a talk soon on this example and I have tried to simplify the situation.
Visuals will help support the flow of information and approving parties.

How about $1050?
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:06:14
That does not change the risk that it could. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 12:39:52
It is between two related entities that do not have a common language. I see my my side of the transaction, but not their side. I track by purchase order and part number, they use a different reference. The transactions are in different currencies. I have tried using databases in the past with no success in this case due to the previous points. 
Using a blockchain solution will allow me to report what I received, they need to match what they sent. The reconciliation will be in real time and not after a quarter of activity. The blockchain will be shared with my auditors and my parent company's auditors. I need the data to be agreed upon and then locked down so it cannot be manipulated as we move forward in time with more transactions.

In an LLC, the assets used in the business are subject a lawsuit. If your LLC business cash is converted to BTC, and if you lost a lawsuit, it could be at risk. An LLC isolates your business assets from your personal assets.

Near zero is not zero. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:48:52
It helps to illustrate that it is a complex issue (with humor) and that there are strong arguments to support both sides. I am used to discussion forums where people can have a variety of opinions and seeing the other person's side. People think I am crazy/reckless  for investing in crypto. They may be right in the end, but there is logic to counter that opinion. That $5 tip in BTC could lead that person to learn more about the potential of crypto and potentially open up an entire new world to that person.

Very eloquent visual on buying BTC at the bottom
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:58:50
ATH is All-Time High value of BTC in this context.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:12:01
Agreed. Great perspective and post on BTC. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:45:35
I agree with your plan. I am dollar cost averaging every two weeks. It is not a lot, but I am buying at lower and lower each week in this market.
