I'm saying that randomly (without regards to need) handing out dollar bills is not a social safety net. If you think there shouldn't be a safety net then own up to it, but don't pretend this is an implementation of one that works.

Explain how a sidechain would fix this issue, feel free to restate the wiki in your own words. Bonus points for implementing it.

Well, if you had mistyped your friend's Wallet address instead of messing up the wire forms, the money would have been gone forever instead of for just 2.5 weeks. I don't think messing something up and then complaining about how it doesn't work at peak efficiency is...a good baseline measurement.
@_date: 2014-10-26 22:28:25
I mean mistyped. And I don't necessarily mean the money disappearing, I agree that is hyperbole. I'm talking more about it going to some random person's wallet who you didn't intend it to. Do I have to search for the links? It's happened, multiple times. Maybe there IS an astronomically low chance of the transaction going through and bitcoiners are just unlucky, that would explain all the stories of you guys losing your life savings on dice-sites.

As long as you anonymously take the contract they put out to kill you, you'll be okay.

Ok, that's actually a good idea. If you want to write the code, I can host the site. I have an old webpage I used to use to trade collectible cards, we can use that for the domain.

You do know that the formula for market cap isn't (Highest price paid for a single thing) x (Number of things in existence) right? Every time someone sells more then a handful of bitcoins, the price dives hard. There isn't 6 billion dollars worth of "value" in bitcoin, not in the sense that anyone could extract it.

Bitcoin is apocalypse proof, stop spreading FUD. When the world as we know it comes crashing down I'm gonna be on top of Mt. Rainier broadcasting the blockchain from my HAM radio and rolling in the satoshis.

Ok. So do you think Bitcoin is the iPad, or the Newton? How fast did the iPad take off when take off when they finally got it right, and how smart would it have been to go all-in on the Newton in 1987?

Jalile can't find anyone to sell her anything with bitcoins. All she can buy is strawberries dried over the hot exhaust fan of a bitcoin miner, and they don't ship to her small village. I steal Jalile's bitcoins, she should have used her other computer to encrypt it in cold storage and printed out a paper wallet with her printer. We try and try, but it's as if these poor people don't want to better their lives with bitcoin.

Just like the essence of your bitcoins will remain.

Teach them how to enter their credit card details into BitPay. That will about cover any conceivable situation where they would encounter Bitcoin in the wild.

I see what you're saying, and if someone can actually set this up I'm okay with it. There just needs to be some way of providing for people that is needs-based and non-random. There's also the issue that a smaller number of people voluntarily participating leads to a larger contribution from everyone, and a disproportionate number of needy flocking to areas with more generous social contracts. Admittedly we haven't solved that last one with the government, ironically because the degree of freedom given to states and municipalities mean we get things like the homeless flocking to California from areas that cut benefits.
I'm always open to a better idea, guess I'm just not convinced yet that this is it. I hope you all are able to work it out, because it's a big deal if it actually does work better in the real world.

I don't personally know Morse code, or economics. But it's been discussed on the wiki, so all someone has to do is implement it. This problem is already solved.

Well, the government will pay to treat your fever for free when the paramedics drag your unconcious body to the nearest hospital run by fat cats stealing from your grandchildren. Congratulations on your life choices!

But it HAS happened. I'm not making this up out of whole cloth, I've read about people who sent money to the wrong address, or mistakenly sent larger amounts then they intended to the right address - multiple times, on this subreddit. This is where the tech-savvy Bitcoin enthusiasts gather, who knows what happens to the person who just wants to send money and don't care about the technology or ideology.
Which, the techie side of me wants to say "Well get your shit together, user", but you can't sell that to people and have them want to voluntarily adopt it over something more convenient that they already use, even if it has marginally higher transaction costs. The solution just isn't that much better then the problem to the average user.

There will be more comments in this thread than additional orders GrubHub would get with bitcoin in 5 years. 
[Remember the city bus system]( that got more complaints when they dropped bitcoin support than they ever had people use the payment option in 9 months? Good times.

No one ever said that no one would ever be generous without the government, we just say that people who are very generous are the surprising exception to the rule. You're all losing your shit because he's handing out dollar bills. You can't run a society like that.

Ah, the ol' one-two bitcoin switcheroo - classic!
*"This jerk stole my money!"*

*"It is you who are the jerk, for your security practices were not rigorous enough. Let me explain why this is your fault...."*
Never change, bitcoin. Currency of the future.

I'm so tired of you socialist trolls. I know that you or I wouldn't necessarily give money to charities, but other people would do it and it would be better and more efficient then having my hard earned money get taken from me at gunpoint by the fat cats in Washington to give to the lazy underclasses.

Fat cars, hot women, and extravagant luxuries - these are the three demons you must slay to succeed in hodling Bitcoins

A couple of months ago, someone in this very sub was complaining that they filled out their friend's information wrong on a bank transfer form, and the money took *two whole weeks* to get returned.
I said "Hey at least it wasn't bitcoin, with bitcoin if you fill out the wrong address your money disappears forever."
Someone got very angry and told me that bitcoin has protections against that built into the *awesome maths* and that it was **statistically impossible** for someone to send coins to the wrong address.
So, in light of this new evidence...keep being your own bank tards, sounds like it's working out real great.

It's cool, taxes are theft and private charity would totally replace it if the damn government would just get off our back with worthless fiat and social services.
