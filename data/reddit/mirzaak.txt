Damnit this guy is so balls deep invested that he doesnt have fiat for shoes! That's the spirit! As much as I hear people all over the place saying this is it for cryptos, I believe we're still early in this. Its always better to invest as we'd spend that money on something anyway! Buy as many shoes as you'd like, my friend. Contact support, we'll give you a little discount for the spirit! :)

We're looking to enable lighting payments but aren't sure what's the best and most practical way. Any help is appreciated!
