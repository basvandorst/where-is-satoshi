Well, Buffet. Thats it. Thats why it worth so much. Because people want to pay for it this kind of money. Same goes with bitcoin, stocks, art and so on... 
Art is the best example i think .

You know what... I sold my bitcoin today. And its amazing that i spent so little on it and now i can do much more with it.
Funny that you mention homeless person. One asked me today for some change. 
I had it of course, thanks bitcoin! :)
Making profit was good...but actually using this money to share was even better. 
My mom has some debt so i helped her a little too :)
Now i have 0 bitcoin but hey, i feel great. 
Sharing is great. 
I hope you will do your best with this bitcoin revolution. World is changing right now! 
PS I'll jump in with bitcoin once again, i hope :P
