This would also cut down on settlement time between banks.  When buying stocks, the money must be in the sellers account no more than 3 days after purchase.  I know it's hard to believe but there are plenty of times where, because the money is just a penny off, the automated system rejects the payment, forcing a human to work with another human to identify the dropped trade, adjust their records, then resubmit.  The receiving bank then must keep an eye out for that wire and accept it because it can be rejected at any time if there are any discrepancies.
Settlements are archaic and need an overhaul with modern technology.  If a blockchain can do that for their private network of banks I'm all for it.

The exchange does not own it.  They keep track of the records and, if you really really want, they can deliver the actual stock certificate physically to you from the sellers account.

Blockchains are more secure with more participation.  Alt coins each use a new and different blockchain so with their lower participation rate compared with the bitcoin blockchain, their blockchain is relatively insecure.
And with the new development of side chains, many believe there is no need to try to run an alternative blockchain than bitcoin

*“I knew Bitcoin was going to be regulated, it was quite obvious. You couldn’t have companies and consumers exposed to risk without some sort of regulatory control.”*
There is a lot of hate on the subject but it comes down to a decision to play in a "walled garden" or not.
There will be a lot of different communities embracing a different way of doing things so this is not that unexpected. 
Welcome to the complexity of the 21st century ;)
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:17:38
Well, because you asked and I do not know you, here's my honest opinion;


May I strongly suggest you present the opinion for a few "brave people willing to try it". Telling people to download an app before knowing more about what the FBI is "warming up to" is not encouraging and it screams amateur hour.  you must act like the veteran exec.
Your mission is to tell them how liquid this new protocol acts in a future world economy.  Bitcoin is a currency that moves across borders in less than 10 minutes.
Do you know about the [DTCC]( They take a max of 3 days to settle stocks to cash transfers between two parties.  The blockchain can do this flawlessly without paying for the 2 settlement officers in under 10 minutes!  We just saved $50,000 if we are only using one settlement officer per trading desk.  *I'm thinking you're firm employees at least 4 ;)*


not bad. feels boring though. I would suggest you keep this out of the main presentation but in your immediate memory for the tough Q&amp;A you will face afterwards.  It would be nice to throw back those names in their faces if they question the validity of this new field.


Here's where you will stay relevant.  Any intern can make a book report on Bitcoin.  Talking about what's relevant this week is what will get you more attention.
I would recommend something like "automated flawless finance" to describe what is being talked about now.  We can issue bonds, stocks, dividends with the blockchain.  We can issue bills and receive payments with the blockchain.  We can settle debts across international borders without the flaws of human incompetence with the blockchain.  All these actions will also have extremely accurate record keeping as well.  This is all automated.  If you see a few worried faces in the crowd during your presentation, they are the ones who are starting to understand it.
Basically, you can tell people this is a very powerful protocol on a scale not seen since email.  The blockchain has been changing everything and it seems like its here to stay.
Good luck and act like you know something they do not.  That will probably help you more than any of the ramblings above.

He did though.  Not explicitly of course, but he used his name as credibility that his funds would pay out.  At the level he was operating at, it was understood he was so high up the food chain that he could "pay to play" ( basically get a few important phone calls before major market movements for his investments)  
It was all a con that Madoff could easily keep going as long as there was not systemic collapse of the major markets (like what we had in 2008).  He could pay anyone $50,000-$250,000 to give him the inside information he needs to keep his portfolios performing.

Then you have more advanced hardware competing for less new bitcoins.  Less rewards for mining makes bitcoin seem more valuable.  People in the know know there are less bitcoins being made.  It places upward pressure on market value for exchange of each bitcoin.

Professional traders use Bloomberg Terminals. Period.  This is a big win for allowing people to invest in Bitcoin. Yes, prices will go up because of this very large window that has opened up for investment.
That said, trusting any fund in modern investment circles is asking for trouble.  Like a battered partner who goes back to their abuser, honest hard-working people will continue to exchange labor and services for dollars and stick them into investment funds.
Give that fund 5-10 years and someone will steal it.  It's not obvious theft.  They will show you every trade they did.  They will not show you that the best returns were placed into their buddies accounts.  They will not show you how brokers that they work with are padding the bill which cut into profits.
Now, introduce Bitcoin.  There is now a definitive, no trace way of losing customer money while still being plugged into the traditional financial services field.  "We got hacked, sorry"
Just remember that many people will see this as a way to invest in Bitcoin.  It is not!  You are investing in a piece of paper that says you own a fraction of the wealth in this investment fund.  
I'm excited that this will spark more interest and more liquidity in Bitcoin but I do not let other people touch my bitcoin.

Reputation would spur trust in the markets.  Demand would increase based on the age and reputation of an open transactions marketplace.  Someone could "get rich quick", but setting up the marketplace where a small percentage goes to the operations would pay out more over the long term.

Just to clarify, your Mt Gox account has been verified but not your Dwolla account?  I know you must verify your Mt Gox account by uploading a scanned image of you license and a recent government or company letter addressed to your name and address.  I scanned both items together and submitted to Mt Gox and was verified the next day.  
Just make sure the problem isn't the Mt Gox account verification.

I like the concept.  Many criticize cryptocurrencies as "not being backed by any value" but as I understand it, this *coin would reward miners (contributors) with supercomputer strength computation on the fly (as well as the occasional coin via mining)

As bandwidth explodes in the coming 'teens, I'd image there will be much more online business activity than what we see now.
Imagine people getting excited about motorized carriages when they first came out and compare to the present day superhighway infrastructure for commercial and personal motor vehicles.  Sure, people could see the future in the first car, but they had no idea of it's effect on the world several decades outs.  The Internet today is still in it's early years in the grand scheme of things.  Two decades and it has already changed the world.  The next two decades will be far more interesting.
Holding onto coins is not really a risk IMO.  Instead of going out for lunch, buy a lotto ticket (one bitcoin) for the future wealth of an online currency.

You described a combo of online and paper.  Online (using an account from bitaddress.com or similar) has security issues when you are making that wallet.  It's up to you to secure your PC before creating the wallet as anyone who snooped on you would also have the password to your Bitcoins.
Paper is the process of creating a wallet on a PC, not connected to the internet.  [Bitcoin Armory]( has a paper solution that's pretty inventive.  You use a PC not connected to the internet to create a temp authorization password to plug into the wallet on your normal PC connected to the internet.

Not to mention that traditional banking (lending money at slightly higher interest rates) is a proven and safe business model.  Major banks today will not settle for the safe reliable returns and their stockholder demand astonishing growth annually.

The problem with manipulation stems primarily from derivatives.  If people place value in derivatives of bitcoins instead of *actual* bitcoins then they are gambling on phantoms of actual wealth.  Their choice to play that game I guess.  Seems like a recipe for disaster for those playing though.
Futures have a very important role in commodity stabilization of prices for producers.  It guarantees that the produces of a commodity can operate their business without the risk of going bankrupt due to market disruptions (i.e. a farmer's corn was bought way before it was discovered there was a surplus of corn that year.  Price was stabilized for the farmer selling his corn)
If miners are guaranteed a price in the future they might decide to dedicate their hardware to the network without the risk of their business model for income collapsing due to wild swings in the price.  Then again, the comparison of the farmer to the miner is a difficult one seeing as how the production from one miner can be greatly effected by new miners starting up.

Ha! I read this picturing someone using Western Union or any other banking model.  Bitcoins are easy.  If you need cash in hand and do not have the means to exchange bitcoin for cash, then don't use bitcoin.  Use the outdated Western Union model that wants 10% in fees and thank them while they rob you and tell them their service is "so easy" to use.
Bitcoin allows value to be sent anywhere in the world for pennies.  If you want to keep your value in bitcoin (which is what many people choose to do) there are absolutely no hurdles at all!

All digital services can now be offered within a vast and truly competitive environment.  Any service that requires a programmer, developer, marketing and advertising, various artists, movie editors, special effects studios, etc. can be payed for with an international medium without transaction costs. 
A small business owner can hire a corporate branding consultant from India, a web development studio in Poland, and a translator from China in one afternoon.  Ideas can be fleshed out on a small business scale in an afternoon.  Informal assignments can be requested if you happen to see an artist/photographer post their work on their facebooks.

Understand the sarcasm but it is true. The scope of the crime is global.  Loans that have been made all over the world not just this month or year but from years past as well fluctuate based on these interest rates.  The scale of the crime is awesome. Not "cool" awesome but genuinely awesome.

Some heavy investors are done buying up their bitcoin positions.  Volume drops so prices adjust to the lowering of demand.  No big fundamental issues with the protocol, simply the worldwide demand has slackened allowing those who see the "true" value of bitcoin much higher to take advantage of the buying opportunity. Smaller investor volume doesn't match the scale of the large investor buying so it appears to go unnoticed.

So they were able to fund their startup with interest free capital from the bitcoin community months ago and now *might* be shipping the promised goods that are defacto way overpriced considering the appreciation of bitcoins used to purchase the hardware.
Fuck these guys. The community doesn't have to put up with terrible business practices anymore.  Everyday that goes by we see enthusiastic smart people joining us and helping the bitcoin community advance.  BFL competition is growing and I for one will gladly support them.

Yes, and tha's where the "money transmitter" problem comes into play. If it was just a vending machine for selling bitcoins to you they wouldn't require such heavy regulations with the govt.

In the stock market game the saying goes, "It's not a loss until you sell". Secure them safely on a paper wallet and walk away. "Admit" you were wrong and tell everyone you will not make that mistake again.  If it never goes back up, whatever.  If it ever skyrockets again, you'll have the last laugh.

Be careful.  This is called technical analysis and it's based on predicting the future off of previous performance.  Things can go wild at any moment.
@_date: 2013-03-31 18:24:01
absolutely correct. But supply and demand is still a pretty solid economic principle to rely on.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:21:10
I admit it is not.  Anyone claiming otherwise would have a lot of explaining to do.  That being said.  It is reasonable to assume that there would be some demand for a currency that cannot be inflated or counterfeited.  Also, anonymous transactions over the internet would boost demand.
Certain? absolutely not.  Favorable for Investment? Absolutely.
In a world where companies bankrupt or dilute their stock, governments inflate their currency and markets that manipulate their interest rates all without recourse, Bitcoin shows promising financial stability.  You are right to correct those that rely too heavily on predicting future performance.  Anticipating future growth on promising fundamentals is what investing is all about though.

If you are really compulsive about trading performance.  Keep track of those 24 coins and make a promise to yourself to not trade them for anything less than $19.  You might have to wait. But at least you will not suffer loss on your trade :)
