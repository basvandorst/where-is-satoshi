Aww..., I got my hopes up. I appreciate your input though :)
Too complicated for my purposes though. Would have to config clients and install debian on my vps instead of centos.

Bitcoin is the current [reserve currency]( of Torga actually.

Playing around with that for a Short while but it won't be feasible until a simpler install is made.

I have 191 citizens, half of which are random people who just did the pledge of allegiance, and another 400 did it for fun at a local city hall meeting and it's important I please my people. I think I've reached Dunbar's Number already.

As soon as I fix this damn-fangled Cryptocurrency thing, I'll give you a pension of 2000 Torgan Dollars. 
As well, you can call yourself "Sir," "Ser" or "Baronetcy"
And therefore, your sons and daughters shall receive this privlege.

I, King Jimmy I, declare you a honorary citizen of Torga and herein then grant you the baronetcy of the village of Carracks, Yukon.

Thats actually not a bad idea :)
Might need to wait for the lightweight client for some of my computers and friends and my department of finance (aka a computer lab full of 2007 computers)

I take the trusted part back, and its gonna be more wide-scale than I thought.

Its purely for fun, I wouldn't give much care if some hacker a managed to get a hold of something only a few hundred people use for fun.
I'm not a programmer, nor do I know of any predeveloped software for a centralized server, nor does any member of my ministry of finance, royal Torgan mint and my royal bank.
As raga's adopting BTC, I'm pretty sure someones already done that and I don't have enough BTC to sustain an economy.

All VPN Providers keep logs. Try to avoid being stupid.

The volatility of Bitcoin value. One day it's $300, next day it drops 40% and increases 10% by Saturday. It's just not really a safe currency to keep your money in.

Correct. In fact, it's bundled with Tails OS now.

I really like the idea but I don't trust it for confidential things right now. Personally I think it's awesome, just needs a external security audit.

Nice try Mt. Gox.
