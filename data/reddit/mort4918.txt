But Bitcoin's not a currency anymore right? It's a store of value and settlement layer. :/

Made great initial gains from ETH, moved to XRP, then it tanked - didn't sell, held - fell further. Decided to start trading to make back gains - bought high sold low.
Fuck me.

All this talk of B2X being the banker's coin, or a corporation backed enterprise.. I don't really get it. 
Y'all know Blockstream, who funds the core team is funded and partially owned by AXA and VC's? Blockstream has financial obligations to their backers. 
Nobody (who has skin in the game), which ever side they're on, is doing whatever they're doing for the greater good of Satoshi's vision or the user.
I really don't get the holier-than-thou attitude when it comes to the Segwit 1x vs. Segwit 2x debate. *Everyone* is coming from the same angle - money.
Dogecoin is probably the only coin that was never financially motivated lol.

I would love to be able to list a charity that accepts bitcoin, but the ones I know are already up here. Leaving a comment instead, just some subjective opinion. 
I see bitcoin as less currency, more a way for people to send fiat currency to each other. The benefits bitcoin can bring to developing nations is huge.
