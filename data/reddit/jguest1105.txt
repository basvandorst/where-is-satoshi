100 BTC are worth over $800,000 USD. Am I missing something or are you really expecting a faucet to give out that kind of money?

Ok. Thanks for clarifying that

I know about the bitcoin you forked last summer.

Current global GDP is ~88 Trillion USD. If all of that was executed with Bitcoin, the value of a single bitcoin would have to be over 4 million USD to accommodate that.
It will of course be a long time, if ever, before the whole world runs on bitcoin. But global GDP could be exponentially higher by then anyway.
Hope this gives you an idea of how much the market cap for bitcoin can grow from its current level of ~145 billion USD.

The bitcoin mining infrastructure is dispersed around the entire world. It would take a coordinated effort by dozens of world governments in order to “seize control” of even a large portion of the bitcoin mining infrastructure.
If that were to happen on a large scale, the huge loss of hashing power would cause the algorithm that mining hardware works on to “mine” bitcoin to adjust (likely after at least a few days) and we’d all be able to use our own laptops or old ASICs to mine bitcoin again, thus maintaining the integrity of the bitcoin mining network, albeit with far less hashing power and security. The government(s) would be hard pressed to keep tens of thousands of small timers like you and me from running bitcoin’s program on our own machines.
Long story short, it’s very improbable and next to impossible for any government or governments to seize control of all bitcoin mining.

Which referrer reward are you going for here? The Morning Brew mug? The Morning Brew t-shirt? Or maybe you’re hoping to get enough people to sign up that they’ll actually fly you to their office.
