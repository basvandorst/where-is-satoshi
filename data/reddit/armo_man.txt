Congrats to the owner but what a horrible thing to buy. I would’ve bought a property or something to make me more money but that’s just me.

Well if the guy has money coming in to afford running that car and some to back up that lifestyle than good for him but from what I’ve read on lambos, they are shit vehicles to maintain. With that said I too would totally buy one if I have a shit tone of money.

I think a lot of people do share this view. Day by day people are realizing the truth thanks to the Internet gods.

I've gone through civil asset forfeiture based on my roommate getting caught with weed. Yes they are desperate for cash and accounts. They seized my bank accounts and a business account that did not belong to me but I made a deposit in and left the receipt in my room. Should give you an idea of how desperate and greedy cops are.

I did hire a lawyer but that lawyer screwed me and kept asking for more money and lied about the time line. I was naive at the time and should've gone to a website to check his credentials. He did give me back half but that's after me telling him to keep fighting when he was about to give up after taking most of my money. So fuck lawyers along with shady law enforcements for ruining my life. It's been 7 years or so and I'm still not over it.
