On the one hand I think it's a good thing that investors can feel safe entering the crypto market, and not feel like they're entering the wild west.
However, if ICOs register with the SEC then only [accredited investors]( will be able to play. Want to invest in an ICO? Better be a millionaire.... Gotta have money to make money, the rich get richer, and so on and so forth.
I hope I'm wrong.

I don't really want to get into a discussion about what our spoiled first world lives would look like without government, because I'm not a big fan myself. 
That said, I selfishly want to get rich off crypto investing. That's going to take massive investment from mainstream suburban Mr. and Mrs. Joe Schmo, and from big institutional investors. 
But my initial post was mainly expressing worry that you'll have to be an "accredited investor" to participate in ICOs after this. That would be a good way for government to destroy everything that's good about this market. Like I said, I'm not a big fan of government, and that outcome would not surprise me.

Thanks for the clarification

I didn't say they were obliged, at all. But if you want mainstream investment in cryptos then people are going to need to feel "safe".

I had assumed it was the opposite, since everyone has been participating in ICOs

I believe that participation in private equity opportunities should be open to everyone, not just those with a net worth of a million or an annual income of 200K or more. Everyone should be able to participate in ICOs.
