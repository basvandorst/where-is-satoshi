whats that command on reddit where u type "tip" and a bot tips a fraction of a BTC to someone? I know reddit didn't do that but still that's pretty epic

so do you think some governments are mining?

as a non-techie guy, can you explain this?

what does this mean though? Just today I clicked "give gold" for the first time by accident (I'm a college student with no money to donate) and it says "bitcoin" as one of the three options, it's before Credit Card.
What do they mean by "not part of the plan?"

so supercomputers can't be changed to be optimized for mining?? At all? They'd have to build new ones?
If the government is, rightfully, so fearful of the power of BTC, then wouldn't they also benefit from controlling a portion of the market?

that's a good point with the bankers man. Let's say Bush or Obama. I call them war criminals, but I obviously know they physically haven't committed war crimes themselves.
I would even go a step further and say that they probably had little to no choice, I doubt either of them wanted the war as much as other people with more vested interest. But they are the person we can associate blame to.
I generally don't believe that crimes without victims deserve punishment. The bankers did have victims though, despite not being "violent." So I think it comes to that.
Did Ulbricht have victims? That's the real question, for me.
