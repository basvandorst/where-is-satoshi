"We once fought to keep slaves, now we will fight to protect drug dealers."
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:17:04
No, it exists to make fun of people who use bitcoin. There just happens to be a sub full of them.
@_date: 2015-05-30 11:53:46
I can get paid for thinking drug dealers should go to jail? Where do I sign up?
@_date: 2015-05-13 23:11:36
please don't reproduce

Who is "they?"

The prosecution could not bring that charge in New York federal court. Those charges are pending in Maryland federal court.
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:42:26
There are literally zero people who are paid to "troll" bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:27:12
and bitcoin hasn't consistently lost value in the past year?
@_date: 2015-01-08 12:47:14
Not sure if this is sarcasm
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:34:53
haha yeah don't talk to the police when you get pulled over for driving with a busted taillight. great idea.
@_date: 2015-01-12 12:58:05
so it really goes back to the ultimate point that bitcoin is really only helpful when you're doing illegal things online
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:39:24
haha please tell me this is sarcasm
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:05:12
But what if I don't want to buy drugs/childporn/etc online? Why does bitcoin help me?
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:46:34
Lol we only went from 1000-300 in a year, instead of 1000-200.
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:29:35
What if I want to take advantage of everything that comes by way of living in a secure nation but give back nothing in exchange?
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:50:48
Bitcoiner confused on how federal law works? How is that possible.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:27:12
Most people don't like to be paid in a currency that fluctuates wildly on a daily basis. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:24:58
Yeah they will probably just be like "nah, we decided not to charge you with trying to procure murder. our bad on that one."
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:12:17
you realize the right to remain silent is after you're under arrest, not before, right?
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:56:38
I can't imagine how nice your life must be if your biggest problem with your country is that counterfeiting is illegal.
@_date: 2015-01-11 00:02:43
Did that actually make sense in your head?
@_date: 2015-01-12 12:58:12
I know right? Just the other day I went to buy a hamburger and accidentally gave McDonald's $10,000. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:13:50
Yeah how dare the judge do his job and let relevant evidence into trial.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:19:15
and how exactly does fabricating charges in a **different jurisdiction** going to help their case?
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:03:36
Actually, yes. If I had the money to open my own bank, it would be easier than safely storing bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-10 18:58:37
Why is this easier than a bank again?

Two trials **in two separate states**. How can New York prosecutors charge him for trying to kill a Maryland resident?
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:45:06
why am I not surprised that a "bitcoin expert" knows absolutely nothing about the legal sysetm
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:32:36
Ok guys, here is the plan. We charge someone with operating a massive illegal online exchange where people can anonymously buy and sell child porn and drugs. But people are usually sympathetic to drug/child porn dealers, so we need something to distract them. So what we'll do is make up charges in a different jurisdiction and have him charged there. I mean, the jury wouldn't be sympathetic to a child porn dealer who *also* procured murder, right?
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:43:54
And when is the collapse of every major currency in the world expected, in your opinion?
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:57:20
Half of the US government? Can you explain which half?
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:30:46
I know, right? How dare they offer the ability to rescind the transaction when someone scams you. I want *no* protection, thank you very much!

@_date: 2015-07-15 13:57:19
Which is...somehow worse than having no recourse at all?
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:12:28
I can't breath. One of you actually *photoshopped* this. It's incredible. "Surely if they realize human females like bitcoin, the moon is our next stop." It's too much, my sides can't take it.
@_date: 2015-04-15 11:40:04
Wait, there are people who think Ross is innocent? I mean, I get that you can argue that he should be able to sell drugs online or whatever, but the amount of cognitive dissonance required to say he's actually innocent of doing so is incredible.
@_date: 2015-04-28 12:23:55
I am so fucking confused by this sub. Are you people actually saying that he is not guilty of running silk road? I get that you all think what he did *shouldn't* be illegal, but I think you would have to be mentally ill to suggest that there is not enough evidence to show that he is DPR.
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:39:05
I actually stopped breathing once I realized I could buy things with bitcoin. I mean, why breath when you have such amazing technology?
@_date: 2015-04-06 01:45:50
OMG I can't believe the federal government is prosecuting people who violate federal laws!
@_date: 2015-11-06 01:48:09
So you don't think that the government can seize money from a drug dealer if they can prove the money was made from selling drugs? I know you think drugs *should* be legal, but they aren't. I'm asking under what the law is, not what you want it to be.
@_date: 2015-11-06 11:45:56
Which you consent to by choosing to live in a country with a government.
@_date: 2015-11-06 02:13:20
What is legal?
@_date: 2015-11-06 02:28:36
You're acting like the government just decided on a whim that this was now a crime. Obviously Ross knew what he was doing was illegal.
@_date: 2015-11-06 20:06:28
Seems like you really don't think the government is that bad if the inconvenience of moving keeps you here.
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:40:43
Have you flown in the last year? Almost every major airline has wifi standard now.
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:57:39
@_date: 2015-03-19 18:43:09
Yeah but they are being stolen by other cult members, not by people who don't already have bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:06:47
Except email was an improvement on communication. Bitcoin is not an improvement on currency.
@_date: 2015-10-20 23:21:46
Why would stealing get the same sentence as making millions of dollars selling drugs/child porn/guns/poison etc?
@_date: 2015-10-21 11:18:11
Wait. So you actually think that Ross made no money from silk road? I've seen a lot of cognitive dissonance from you folks, but this is actually incredible.
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:31:18
I currently use USD. I do not want to buy drugs/weapons/child porn through online black markets. For what reason do I need bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-21 00:16:50
But he totally didn't do that! /s
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:47:04
hahaha pray tell what evidence that is
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:02:35
I disagree that selling these things result in no harm. How can you possibly think that child pornography is a victimless crime?
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:10:40
I'm not sure if I should laugh because this is hilarious, or cry because a person is actually this stupid.
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:22:00
I would love to see someone try to explain the difference.
@_date: 2015-03-25 11:30:23
Yeah who needs school, just watch this series of youtube videos about Ron Paul.
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:31:38
wait, you're exposed to the monetary fraud by *not* using bitcion? lol wut?
@_date: 2015-11-15 00:02:49
My god you people are seriously deranged sociopaths
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:48:02
But you just said it should be legal to sell child porn online. If that's not what your saying, please clarify.
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:47:51
These comments are incredible. Libertarians on white guy who runs $200 million dollar online drug exchange: "injustice." Libertarians on young black male in prison for stealing a pack of gum "nobody is above the rule of law."
@_date: 2015-10-21 01:07:50
Lol. So he didn't make millions of dollars off commissions from sales of illegal drugs, child porn, guns, poison, fake IDs, and other things?
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:23:58
Because you can't run online exchanges where people trade drugs, weapons, and child pornography? 
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:14:12
Yeah it's a good thing that silk road didn't end up in anyone being shot or sta...oh wait.
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:05:38
people who have taken libertarianism to its logical conclusion: anarchy
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:24:43
Also, where are all the comments about his mom saying he "dindu nuffin!" Oh wait, that's only for blacks.
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:32:58
I can't believe that I live in a country where someone can't operate an online black market where anyone can anonymously purchase drugs, guns, and child pornography. The founding fathers did not create this country so that such innocent civilians would face tyranny from the government. This country should stand up for innocent drug dealing, money laundering, MURDER FOR HIRING heroes like Ross.
