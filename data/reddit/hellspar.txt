Buy bitcchn? Idk sounds like a scam coin to me.
@_date: 2019-07-30 22:22:55
Please do. It only makes anything that the government bans more desirable.
@_date: 2019-07-27 06:16:13
Haha Ikr. Biiiiittttttcccccchhhhnnnn!
@_date: 2019-07-25 23:28:07
Which is less risky?  LOL.
@_date: 2019-07-14 07:11:24
If only it was blue.
@_date: 2018-09-20 17:54:04
Avoid the blowhole. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 03:55:43
Nice. Tears of joy, our BTC is growing up so fast. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:41:34
Better than a flat line. Hopefully it will never come to that. I hate doing mouth to mouth. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:33:39
Agreed, smaller purchase batches is better than all in. Especially when buying from unknown person(s).
@_date: 2018-09-16 05:04:14
If you do buy a hardware wallets, like others suggested, be sure to get them directly from the manufacturer. No ebay, no Amazon, and definitely no free hardware wallet hand outs.

Malibu! King Kong ain't got nothing on me!
@_date: 2018-09-08 09:40:29
Got me at "Tab Pined to Coinmarketcap in browser". 
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:09:52
It wasn't even his Lamborghini ether. Crazy, still dusted all of them with zero experience. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:33:58
Eyes above the horizon, Eyes above the horizon, Eyes above the horizon, dang it I failed, what where you saying?
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:46:41
Don't know? Maybe what is left will be moved into a newer resurrect version of btc, or another coin with the same atrbuits. Btc will evolve and adapt. Frankly it is so far off into the future, I doubt any of us will be alive to witness it happening. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 09:22:20
They have $hit coins ones too, guess how they come out the other end....
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:33:00

Better than the stupid "this is an pineapple, this a pen..." crap.

If your not standing on a toilet, your not high enough on the pot.
@_date: 2019-03-15 07:54:12
With all the crypto kidnappings, targeted hacking, $5 wrench attacks, I just don't want to go around advertising that I have bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 19:43:01
Dosen't matter. We have the biggest crooks today taking a big chunk of our crypto, the IRS.
@_date: 2019-03-08 23:46:58
What ^ said. Payment reverses is why not too many people will want sell to PayPal buyers. Been there done that as a seller, and will never again accept PayPal. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 00:57:41
Doing Bitcoin sideways... I can dig it. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 08:13:06
Cough* cough*
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:26:07
Hey look, 2in1 there's a fork version as well.
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:13:06
Yes, click BTC &gt; Send and Receive &gt; Receive &gt; copy address. Use that address to send to in Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:56:37
Agreed. People forget that coins can be programmed to change and adapted to the current or future issues and or problems.
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:53:30
I don't speak Japanese,  so I wouldn't know.
@_date: 2019-08-09 00:59:50
Probably not in our life time. Maybe our grandchildren's lifetime.

Speaking of taking a dump.....
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:52:48
For sure. Dealing with the heat as well, especially in the summer days. Just not worth it, literally. 
@_date: 2019-08-06 22:12:31
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:58:27
What a basket full of hot air.
@_date: 2018-06-15 04:29:12
Ya, post before the news came. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:44:56
2020 sounds about right. The halving happens. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 00:56:18
$hit won't get off the bottom of my shoes. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:39:06
Other than the lights on the side, that is the best looking BTM I've seen thus far. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 08:02:09
No, even with free or near free electricity. Trying to get rid of my own S9. I say take that $700 and dollar cost average it into BTC or whatever tickles your fancy. You will be better off in the long run. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:39:23
Blood moon phase.

Doesn't he still Tweet?
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:38:34
Seriously dude. 
If you can't see the shady of the this scam, you shouldn't be in this tech space. Stick to your 9-5 job and save your money. Due a little more research before getting in.
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:08:03
Funny how it looks the same if you flip the image upside down. 
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:43:56
We are trying to SAVE you in a jackass way.  If you can't see that also, then look on the mirror.
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:55:32
No, FOOLS RUN.
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:03:44
Very carefully. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:54:51
I use to use bitpay commerce integration on my specific web cart. Maybe look into that. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:41:59
lol, or eat sheep.
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:27:01
I sure hope you have a Money Transfer Licenses and approval from SEC to do so. Bad juju. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:34:23
I guess the dummy in the window is about 70% without the head.
@_date: 2018-06-12 08:11:49
Try Openbazaar. I remember seeing vape related stuff on there. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:05:45
Both are pretty good. Square is instant purchase with CC, with Abra you would have to wait for bank transfer. Fee's so so for both, but it doesn't bother me.
@_date: 2019-02-27 18:25:08
HODL is soooooo 2018, get RECKED is the new HODL. :P
@_date: 2019-08-04 06:54:29
Great, ya jinks it!
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:52:46
Ain't that the truth.
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:16:00
Mine some altcoins, with some used gpu's, trade em out to bitcoins with shapeshift. It's not much but hey, it's a start before you turn 18. Sell the gpu's back into btc as well.

You can.... if you don't mind earning your first 0.000001 cent in about 100000 years.

Black and white, maybe a shirt faded up like in the background. Probably have to pre die the shirt before the logo.
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:50:10
Might look fugly doing it, but I thing a table is the max size I would put in front of a BTM. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:22:38
Ya I got some thin strips of 3m. Getting it off was a challenge. My wife was behind me watching me the whole time , I didn't  know see was there, giggling. I must look like a crazy idiot dry humping a fridge. Man what a day. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:50:27
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:51:28
*think, fu auto correct. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:19:06
Lol, I thought I was the only one who notice. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:03:04
For sure, trying to peel the dame thing off my fridge door as we speak. Ironically didn't know it was a magnet like the frigde magnets next to it. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:00:08
What Laxie5372 said. Or if you're intent is to use bitcoin, get a Bitcoin debt card load it up, spend anywhere. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:50:37
Haha whoops, I thought that magnetic dock was a decorative badge. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:26:40
Haha, right in front of WFargo sign. 
@_date: 2019-09-01 02:36:59
That would be a cool t-shirt.
@_date: 2018-07-13 07:57:50
When VW? Hmmm kinda got a ring to it. :)

@_date: 2018-12-07 00:40:25
Fuk tat! Panic and hide from the wifey!
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:09:23
When Youtubers put titles like end of bear, end of bottom or something in that nature. More than likely it's not. Tired of hearing and seeing the same crap spewed over and over again. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:42:24
I use it once awhile back but reviews on the app now are God awful. Not sure what up with it lately.
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:24:01
Not electronics but for software, PC, Xbox, PS, OS's.
@_date: 2018-12-01 00:31:52
Na, Thano's already fu that wallet.
