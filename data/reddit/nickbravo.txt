I always buy bitcoin when it's peaking. Period. Then, if I ever sell something, I do right before it appreciates.
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:01:40
I just use Wasabi wallet, that's all. I read your story and only understood half. Nevertheless, I almost shat myself.
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:35:01
You just go ahead and express everything in mBTC, for example. One of many ways how to solve this
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:28:24
Best of luck to you and me both. Although my exposure is way lower because I'm still at the beginning of my career. If I had 100k, I'd definitely not put it in a house right now
@_date: 2019-11-22 01:32:20
The difference being that the basket of things is smaller for BTC than for dollar. What about gold though? Is gold's basket of things smaller than BTC's? Seems like gold's value is based on its scarcity. Hard to imagine that it has value because necklaces can be made out of it.

Scratch the part about millenials, your description fits fiat just as good as crypto?

@_date: 2019-11-19 15:40:28
You're right. Nothing to add here ;)
@_date: 2019-11-15 19:06:50
It's money I would spend anyways. Otherwise, I agree. Whenever I gather a little bit of fiat, it either goes into crypto or other stores of value.
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:49:44
Thx, made my day!
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:06:49

@_date: 2019-11-05 08:44:35
Very generous! Thx
@_date: 2019-11-15 18:59:40
Good stuff! I'm off work and will check out your list now.

Crypto is a new asset class, therefore investors still have difficulty pricing in events like halvings. Still, price movements around subsequent halvings should be increasingly less dramatic, as investors become more apt at pricing such events in.

Much success accumulating. Maybe you can set a monthly investment goal. I have a feeling the next bull run is still some time ahead, so you might reach 1 BTC after all.

Try to do it via her. If there is a way to establish trust, I'd do it for you. However, have you tried via Tor/VPN and maybe a descentralized  exchange, like Bisq? Or is it too dangerous that your bank might wee that you bought crypto? India's ban on crypto is very tough!
@_date: 2019-11-25 20:45:50
DO you have any other trustworthy people/relatives living abroad?
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:13:21
Wish I could buy now instead of a month ago
@_date: 2019-11-15 15:19:31
Price made a sharp drop recently. Would this have sth to do with it?

I sold 5 BTC at around 270€ . Additionally, the funds were frozen in my account afterwards because BTC24 got busted. I only ever recovered 72% of the funds and swore myself not to fall for it again.
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:02:58
I know a few people who own bitcoin. However, I'm more often than not surprised by my generation's ignorance toward the topic.

This is great for Christmas, thank you very much for sharing!

I take your point that gold was traded as a utility long before it became a speculative asset.
There are many use cases for Bitcoin, which neither gold nor fiat (which is impossible to reform and notoriously corrupt) are able to solve, which is why Bitcoin holds value and is being traded as a speculative asset.
Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is totally superior to gold. Still, it holds similar properties due to its scarce nature (unlike fiat currencies which will be devalued when the next crisis hits). As time progresses, I trust that people recognise these utilities of Bitcoin.
I did an economics Bachelor, before turning to IT. I remember being indoctrinated at school that monetary policy like monetary expansion is legit and necessary during times of crisis. However, I'm starting to think that this is BS and that people are better off with assets like crypto and gold whose supplies are not at the mercy of an out of control global financial system and central banks. Assets like crypto and gold can actually be trusted. I bet the growth that could be achieved by accepting these mediums of exchange would be more sustainable than what we've seen over the past decades, followed by the spectacular crash in 2007.

I've been wondering about civil liberties in Australia for a while now
@_date: 2019-11-07 16:32:44
It's not abut liking it I think - it's that they just understand it marginally better than previous generations.
Personally, I love it.
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:35:52
Am I the only one who thinks it's important that BTC holds $7k support level?
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:36:03
I see way too few of these signs around Berlin. Anyone have a link where I can buy "Buy BTC" stickers or something in bulk and cheap?

So what do you do at this store? You can get cash for your BTC?

No idea who she is or what she did/didn't do wrong. See that smile though that she is able to retain in the mugshot? That smile spells bitcoin

I'm certainly looking forward. Thanks for the update.
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:26:07
Buffet seems pretty straight forward to me. The average multi-millionaire BTC critic has  investments in Crypto though I'm sure
@_date: 2019-10-27 01:52:21

You can interpret whatever you like.. the symbolism is all over the place

Same here, I bought stuff with my BTC yesterday and even thought like: Or should I hold out till after the weekend? I don't even get that frustrated anymore though.

Feels more like a bear attack though

Call me stupid, but isn't large part of the decrease in purchasing power the inflation target?

Heads off to Russia.. not only dominating the troll business but also the crypto markets. But since it's only Local Bitcoins, how meaningful is this chart?
Germany apparently is nowhere near the top..

Couldn't come up with it yesterday night. Getting older doesn't make me brighter �� thx
@_date: 2019-10-18 06:48:48
Nobody ever advised me to stop investing my money, however when I tell people about Bitcoin, I'm usually surprised about their indifference toward the topic. The only thing they would really care about is Bitcoin price.

Meanwhile, in 1995, my parents forbade me to use walkmen, saying that they destroy my hearing.
Meanwhile, in 1997, I had to fight for an internet-connection at home.
Meanwhile, in 2003, I had to fight for broad-band internet at home.
Meanwhile, in 2015, I told my Dad to buy bitcoin, which he didn't.
Meanwhile, in 2016, I had to explain to my parents that Donald Trump's candidacy for president is real.
Today, my parents themselves couldn't do without the internet  anymore, although it still hurts to look at them use it. They still believe Bitcoin is about to crash to 0 at any point.
I will turn 30 soon. I am from Germany. I don't know how it is in other parts of the word... personally though, I am impressed by my parent's generation's inability to call the next big thing, even if it had been in front of them the whole time.
And Germany's and Europe's economies reflect it: There are barely any big corporations left because digitalization was 100% missed.
@_date: 2019-12-31 10:47:36
Except for the one that was posted from Miami, that one looked sweet enough to be posted
@_date: 2019-12-30 18:53:55
Germany hasn't embraced new technologies for decades and the traditional industries are in crisis because they're affected by changes from all kinds of sides. Digitalization is affecting all markets and Germany as well as the rest of Europe have not one significant tech firm.
While there were 46 European companies among the 100 highest valued companies worldwide in 2007, there are only about half as many today ([
The outlook for the Euro zone after an entire decade of economic stagnation is basically not that great.
We need a flexible labour market and a transfer union for the Euro to work. While the transfer union might come, the labour market in Europe will never be flexible. Therefore the Euro makes no sense.

I still know which eMail I used to register. I might also remember my password. But it's all gone?
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:46:42
I could set up a contract if there is a chance to recover it. I live in Berlin, Germany. If you manage to recover my 5 coins, I'll be happy to give you 3 coins and keep 2 myself.
The problem is simply that I had the coins in my account on the exchange and the exchange obviously went down. I still have the email address which I signed up with though.
If you know how to retrieve my coins, let's make it happen.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:27:07
I purchased before. I am keeping an eye on the board, thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:11:26
I found this thread: [ which outlines a possibility to recover the coins: apparently by contacting Simon Hausdorf, the owner of the site. However, I have the feeling that the link to Simon Hausdorf's profile is not working anymore:


Does anyone here have a clue how to contact Simon Hausdorf these days? Maybe he would know something..
