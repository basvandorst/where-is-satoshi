The beautiful thing about Bitcoin is that it can evolve to do what any other crypto coin does, such as smart contracts in this case.
Its slow to change because it needs substantial consensus, but when you get that consensus, you know its fully vetted by some of the smartest people in the world.
Why not leave it to other crypto?
You have to trust that other blockchain to be as secure, as decentralized, and as immune to outside forces as bitcoin is.
Ethereum has had a rollback after a hack, has partially centralized leadership, and an uncapped supply of coin.
Many other cryptos are just fantastic testing grounds/feeders for Bitcoin.

Currently a lot of focus is on taking care of scaleability, by way of segwit, LN, etc. because bitcoin was forced to deal with this problem through a growth in crypto popularity. Whats going to be the point in Litecoin and BCH if bitcoin transaction fees are low?
Similarly, I dont think we will see smart contracts really make their way into bitcoin in any substantial way until there is a huge surge in demand for smart contracts. What will be the point of ethereum if bitcoin can solve smart contracts?
This is not to say that second layer tech didnt exist before the growth in popularity, nor does it mean that there isnt work currently being done re: smart contracts. But priorities are priorities.

Other than the inherent risks of setting too low of a fee, there is no fundamental risk of having your coin in a segwit wallet vs standard.
There are many great wallets out there, but if your super paranoid, it may be worthwhile to wait for the next bitcoin core wallet release. It will have segwit enabled on the GUI side (currently enabled only by code currently).

The point of bitcoin is to complete the transaction you want free from influence.
But remember kids, unless you got the keys you gon have to make cute videos for those who are holding your keys, because pRoCeduRes.

To be fair that sending address is owned by f2pool, who also solved that block. 
No point in paying anything in that case.
