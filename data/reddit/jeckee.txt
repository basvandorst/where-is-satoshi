You should expect to have a good time and see some smart people.  It might surprise you that most people will be more interested in talking in the lobby area than watching the scheduled talks.  There might also be a line for the men's room.  Make sure that you don't take a hot wallet with much BTC, there will also be some BTC thieves looking for their next score.

I don't think that one could build multiple blocks before the network as a whole successfully builds a block.  Also the miners would be verifying your block's confirmed good transactions list, so if the transactions did not make sense with the rest of the blockchain then your newly created block would not be seen as a valid block.

I have been waiting patiently for a couple days hoping that the part of my site that uses their API will just start working again.
There was a post about it here:
It is awesome that they are providing such cool stuff over at blockchain.info and I appreciate the API, but it would be cool if they let us know that something was going on through twitter or something.

I don't really know how important it is I guess, but if the newcomer is able to download and boot ubuntu from a flashdrive then they might as well also save bitcoinaddress.org to a flashdrive because that would be the easiest part.  I think the site is design to be used that way actually.  It saves as one file.  The video was cool though and I am sure it will help people.

I recommend printing encrypted key/address pairs in sets of 7.  Then you can test 1/7 of the addresses on each sheet before sending any significant amount of coins to one of the remaining 6.  It takes some extra time, but I definitely recommend creating about a dozen address to store your coins in, and even create the addresses and send the coins to them on different days.  Backup, backup, backup your keys and passwords.  Also think of paper wallets as one use storage devices.  When moving funds out, take it all at once, and sweep it into a hot wallet.

They have got us all anticipating their product though, so I guess they might know what they are doing.

I don't think it is possible to "back" a cryptocurrency with a metal or whatever because it brings trust back into it.  Metals and crytos complement each other pretty well anyways.

I have been thinking about how to solve the voting problem.  I think it is really interesting.  You can think about all of the properties that being able to vote needs just like you can think about what properties money needs and how that was solved with Bitcoin.  A vote needs to be by a person that has a provable identity, they can only vote once, the vote needs to be verifiable afterwards in a public ledger, and the vote needs to be anonymous.

Yes! Thank you. This post is what I was browsing to find.  I am just making one little call to them as a new feature to my site and it seemed like I was getting rejected.  I also noticed that the site was "checking my browser" from their DDoS prevention service, so I thought something might be going on.

Although we are seeing centralization of mining operations currently I think that one should expect to see this become redistributed in the future as the technology gets normalized.  Hashing chips might also become like standard components in machines as heating elements.  It is also worth considering that a few dozen independent operator mining bitcoin on a large scale is still significantly more distributed than our current central banking system.

That was cool to make, but a crucial step is to save bitcoinaddress.org to another flash drive before booting ubuntu so that you can run it without getting online.  Just right click and select save page while on bitcoinaddress.org.

It could be that groups that are interested in buying large amounts this month have just decided to wait for the auction.  So that would cause the current market to be short of buyers.  Also people that plan on buying coins at the auction would be motivated to try and drive the price down slightly before the auction by whatever means possible.

Just ease into it.  Send small amounts to paper wallets and get the hang of it.  It is important to understand that paper wallets are kind of good for storage, but are basically a one use thing.  You can have the paper wallet and send money to it over and over, but when you are ready to move it I recommend creating a new wallet on blockchain.info and importing your paper wallet's private key.  Then once the funds are confirmed and ready to be sent, then send them to your hot blockchain wallet for spending, an exchange to cash out, or to a new paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-02 10:44:00
The remaining 10% probably would not be able to produce enough hashing power and it would take a long time to make blocks.  Everyone's coins would be safe and sound in cold storage.
I have heard this type of a question before and it always gets brushed off, but I think it is interesting.

Dogecoin seems like it is going to become the tipping system used by twitter and other social sites.  It is only a few months old and has done some cool stuff.  The people that come into both r/bitcoin, and now r/dogecoin to basically troll come along with it becoming a big valuable thing.
Also tipping online like this is so new that we have not really found the exact right way to make it fun, invisible, and spam free.

Things like this are priced into the market.  I think that it is good publicity though for the US government to be holding the largest single day auction of bitcoins.  It is a good opportunity for new investors to enter the market that did not know how to play with the new bitcoin markets, but they are experts at dealing with auctions and things.  So in short, to the moon.  
@_date: 2014-05-17 23:10:44
I guess you could estimate that it will take .0001 BTC to send from each address.  Therefore if the .05 is in one address then you should expect it to be worth .0499.  Maybe there is a way to have multiple inputs when sending so that there is only one fee instead of a fee per address, but I don't know how to do that.  The best way to get .05 BTC currently is to buy it from Coinbase for about $22.  Those "faucets" that give out "dust" are kind of spammy and gimmicky I think, and they are not a good intro to new people.
@_date: 2014-05-17 12:26:30
Are you unable to spend them now even with the 91 confirmations?  The number of confirmations will keep getting larger and larger over time, it is not trying to reach a specific threshold or something. Six is the standard for a totally solid transaction. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:18:41
Kind of the point of Bitcoin is to not keep your money with a 3rd party, so don't do that unless you don't think you can store the coin securely yourself.  I would suggest you buy $20 worth of BTC as a way of getting back into it.

What do you mean "doing her bachelor degree on bitcoin"?  
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:59:14
It is all a guess, but I have a couple thoughts.  I could see the price even going to like $300 over the next couple months before we see the next pop to hopefully like $3,000.  
It also seems like there are a lot of things going on at once.  Everyone that is against Bitcoin is doing everything they can to ruin it.  They must be coming at it from all angles; propaganda on social media, propaganda in the news, DDoS attacks, arrests, corporate infiltration, confiscations, and price manipulation.
Also on a more positive front, people and business with lots of money to invest probably hired people to put the system to a test by trying to exploit any security breaches before large investments are made.
I have also been a buyer as the price continues to drop.  I don't really mind short term price drops because I am long-term bullish.

No, it doesn't work.  It says that blockchain.info cannot do it yet and refers you to bitcoin-qt and says "RPC service call sendrawtransaction is known to work".  You can see the message by just trying to send the transaction that is there by default. (ms-brainwallet, I have not tried myself at blockchain.info yet)

Using a dollar value average is always a good idea.  So maybe buy like a third of what you want in the next month or so, and then invest the remaining 70% over the next 18 months.  Good luck.

Bitcoin is exciting, so I can understand why you want to share it with people.  It seems like a lot of people in here are giving you a hard time, but as long as you did not tape those things to peoples cars or doorknobs, I think it is cool.  The picture is unacceptable though.

It would just be a fork, and maybe given the world is falling apart, the new fork is useful, but if it was a bad actor during the crisis then people would probably not accept their blockchain as the true history when everyone comes back online.

"I've checked your watching wallet and all of your bitcoins are safe and sound, good night Peter."
@_date: 2014-03-30 08:48:03
Well because Bitcoin is so traceable there is a possibility that some coins will be "blacklisted" because of their history.  This is why all coins should be laundered during every transaction, because fungibility is an essential characteristic of cash.  Without laundering the coins you run the chance that you will accept coins that have been blacklisted and therefore are not worth as much as non-blacklisted coins.  In this case 1BTCblacklisted &lt; 1BTC.

I don't think they can be worth more than the value of everything divided by 21 million. So in that way they are limiting each other in that they cannot take on more value than is allotted to them by their percentage of the total available coins.
