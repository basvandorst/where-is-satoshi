If you can get 100 coins for $3.5K, BUY THEM!      
It's more like 4.8K.
I'm not that good at math, but $48/BTC ... seems like more than 3.5K!

The scary thing is if a hacker discovered this potential exploit either by examining the code or by running a side network and testing scenarios.  Or perhaps by injecting the bug into the code.  As you said, had a hacker known about it, they could have committed a huge heist.
Expect people to be building infrastructure (people and equipment) to look for similar exploits and conduct cyber-crime.  It'll likely target the big guys.

That pdf wasn't viewable in my pdf reader (andriod), but if it's the paper I think it is, there are issues with the methodology, that have been discussed elsewhere a few times.
I would think a more appropriate measure of "in circulation" would be based on a period of time:  e.g.  what percentage of bitcoins have transferred at least once in the past 90 days.
That would rule out the bitcoins mined and move once in 2009 (for instance).

I'm curious as to the metric you are using.
Since a bitcoin can be passed around 140+ times a day (and therefore, the daily theoretical volume limit is greater than 140 x 10.8M BTC) and we are nowhere near 30% of that number, I'm not sure how you are arriving at your stats.
... not that transaction volume hasn't increased, or that the rest of your comment is inaccurate, but how do you define "in circulation"?

And you're nailin' em?

True, but that's following the previously agreed upon protocol rules.  In this case, though, the consensus decided to forego the rules, and take real money away from people.
It was the right decision for the long-term viability of Bitcoin, but a very poor decision when considered at the individual level.  In this case, the good of the many outweighed the pain inflicted on the individual.
I feel like the people who lost out should be compensated by the people who gained in the process.  
As longterm solutions to these types of issues are bantered about, I hope that consideration is given for fairness in the resolution process.

Skyrocketing is all relative.
If a backyard hobbiest rocket goes 200 feet in the air, it looks pretty impressive to those on earth.  Until they see a NASA launch.  
It could very well be that the current price rise has barely got us off the launch pad relative to where the price is in 2015.

Contrarian view:  people are verifying so they can bail out in large quantities.
