I agree 100%. It's great they are taking Bitcoin but I'd still rather buy an Amazon GC at Gyft then buy from Tigerdirect and lately Newegg has been sucking too. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:06:14
I don't know. All I can say is hopefully this will be another lesson (sadly at your expense) for people to learn not to keep any significant amount of funds in an online wallet.

I had the same problem with both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. I was doing fresh installs, syncing the whole blockchain, deleting the Armory databases, and trying to restore the real wallet instead of the watch-only but nothing worked. I finally got so mad about Armory not working I just exported all my private keys and imported them back in to Electrum. Haven't looked back since. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:49:22
Armory is a great option. If you don't have a spare PC just grab a cheap old netbook off eBay for less than $100 bucks and install Ubuntu and offline Armory on it. There is a whole guide on the Armory website. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:02:26
I thought the recommendation was always waiting for 3 confirms before being "sure". While this is an issue it seems like if you followed that recommendation you would never have a problem. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:59:32
Did you have the API access on? That seems to be another way for access. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 02:14:58
Yeah it is pretty sad. But they've gotten really terrible lately with the GPU prices when demand went crazy. And service has been shit since then. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:11:39
Can't you set up Electrum as an offline wallet though? I'm assuming OP did not do that but I currently have it installed on an offline netbook and just ferry transactions over to the offline when I need to send. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 22:06:02
Yeah right after I posted that I found it from the logo. Are you just running the daemon or the full gui for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:28:31
What's the program that produces that output? I've got tons of resources I could put to use at home and I'm a sucker for nice graphs. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:55:18
I want to say Armory automatically makes you a new receive address every time you press the Receive Bitcoins option. I've never seen the same one come up twice. 
@_date: 2013-09-26 15:34:39
Sadly eBay is flooded with whole set ups right now. I thought about ditching my 9/Hub/Fan but I figured I'll screw around with some alt coins for the time being. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:33:06
Are you just linking your shitty website all over this subreddit? Come on man at least add something useful to the conversation rather than using impatience and user error to attempt to make a company look bad. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 21:06:42
Yeah the SMS system has been really slow for me. I ended up attaching a Google Authenticator to my account. However my SMS has been working today. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 16:22:38
But you get the coins the second you buy them if you're level 2 verified. I think that's the part we are missing. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:32:37
If you are using an offline wallet that's not a concern. Either way the point was you let it happen twice :(
@_date: 2013-09-16 00:09:20
Yes this is true. But I haven't found a better service that works so well.
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:37:27
This comes up multiple times per day. Their software has lots of false positives. Email support and they'll get you straightened out. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 19:01:22
Yep. Though from what I've seen there are quite a few, for lack of a better term, suckers on eBay right now. Just saw a guy within the last day sell ASIC USB Eruptors for 35 a piece. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:06:37
Saving bitaddress.org as HTML only and then booting a LiveCD is going to be your cheapest option (as mentioned above). 
Using Armory is super easy to set up but requires another PC that will never be connected to the internet. I'd say if you aren't comfortable with the technical stuff (as buying old netbooks may require some fun) go the paper wallet route with bitaddress.org. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:35:39
No joke in this day and age if your bank can't get your money back from obvious fraud you have a terrible bank. I had my PayPal account get compromised (I was young and dumb and didn't have 2FA on) and I would have lost almost $1200 but Bank Of America sorted it out in a day or two. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:24:36
Makes the most sense. While I feel for OPs loss there have been COUNTLESS threads on how to make secure offline wallets. If you have 91 BTC surely you can afford a cheap netbook to run offline Armory or something similar. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:35:37
Armory is also a good option. However it takes a ton of RAM (sits on 4GB) and requires both an online and an offline computer. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:40:58
If you want to get mad, get mad at the people who obviously gamed Coinbase out of BTC by making purchase they knew they didn't have money in the bank to pay for. Coinbase is just doing what they can to protect themselves from potentially being out ALOT of money. Sure they could have announced it better but it makes perfect sense that they don't want to trust people anymore. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 02:03:00
What's it hash at? I feel like $.50 an hour sounds high. 
@_date: 2013-09-05 21:23:05
Article? (I'm curious because I've never heard that)
Edit: Found it. Not exactly recent (2005) but I don't think Skype was as popular then. 
@_date: 2013-09-21 20:19:05
Not if he's a new customer. 30 day waiting period before you can instant buy and you have to verify your identity first. I'm not saying Coinbase isn't great (because it is) but new users can't take advantage of all the features until 30 days after they buy their first coins. 
@_date: 2013-09-19 14:16:53
Yeah thankfully if something terrible is happening (unlikely) I've only got about .12 BTC there anyways. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:23:44
Hey to each their own. I've had no problems buying and selling with them. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:02:12
Delete your databases with Armory turned off and then start it up again. I had the same issue and it has never returned after doing that. 
With that out of the way let us get your attitude under control. None of what you described is difficult for anyone with basic computer knowledge. The fact is Armory is not designed for people who can't handle basic computer tasks or who don't want to be hassled when they spend coin. There are plenty of other cold storage options that work well for people with less than basic computer knowledge. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 00:25:25
Never touched it until about 2008 (hell it might have been later). Then again I didn't really care about phones in 2003. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:25:50
I have no issues buying .01 every Friday and I've been doing it for a couple months now. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:31:18
You can mine any other SHA256 coin. I was mining PPC/TRC before I sold off my ASICs. 
@_date: 2013-09-24 01:16:55
No joke. If nothing else the fact that you pay over 5 years. I can only imagine the difficult in 5 years. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:42:39
Blockchain.info with the Android app works well. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 15:16:56


Honestly would that big that big of a surprise? Think of all the people who preordered ASICs and when they get them are just happy to make anything back. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:09:25
Yeah I can't say I built the rig as I bought it from some place. I too repurposed my old gaming rig (hence the huge CPU cooler). 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:20:30
Not true. I pay roughly $30 a month to run my rig and make roughly $120. So electricity does cut in to profits but not 50% (unless your electric rate sucks). 
@_date: 2013-10-02 02:35:00
Technically you can never know but they've been on a few different sites answering questions about their lack of logging. 
@_date: 2013-09-07 13:32:42
If you're buying BTC with a bank transfer it takes about 5 days for purchased coins to be available. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:02:09
Yep it's pretty easy other than having to type in those codes. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:48:32
Heavyily fee'd? They charge 1% plus $.15 USD. You said it yourself they are not an exchange but they provide a fast and easy way to buy Bitcoin. I'm sorry you've had a bad time but that's no reason that TONS of other people should stop using Coinbase. 
Also as far as the high risk thing if you even bothered to scroll down the main page you'd see TONS of threads stating that their filter is a little overzealous and how to correct the problem. It has nothing to do with them price fixing. 
@_date: 2013-09-05 20:25:10


Not to steal your thunder but unless the founders of eBay also own Microsoft, they don't own Skype. 
@_date: 2013-09-19 12:52:04
No joke. When I was in college I used to just take my laptop to the bathroom with me every time (regardless of how annoying it was) because I never trusted ANYONE (other than life-long friends) with my stuff. 
@_date: 2013-09-24 17:28:41
Probably going to have to jump through whatever hoops those websites require to get in. Or it may be that you are permanently locked out depending on the website. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:55:27
Not much choice from their end. It was either blanket require it for everyone or hope the "trusted" people don't go bad. Again it sucks but their are other less convenient options too. 
@_date: 2013-09-07 16:08:43
Do I have to hit a full BTC purchase? Because I've bought maybe .5 BTC (at .1 per buy) and I've had the long wait every time.
EDIT: Just saw the 30 day thing. That might be part of my issue. 
EDIT2: Yep I'm dumb. I have 11 days left until I'm verified. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:30:07
I've never attempted to use TOR but I've had no problems paying for my PIA subscription in BTC. Usually you'd get a page with a BTC address and a timer. If you got that far just send the BTC to the address and it should refresh the page when it is received. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:26:07
My wallet tells me I've made $53 this past week mining LTC. I respect your opinion but it's simply not true. Also I didn't pay $300 for either of my cards. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:04:31
Pretty common is an understatement. This happens a few times a day on here. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 14:27:08
Could have been worse. Though I expect when more ASIC stuff actually hits the market it's going to get even more retarded. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 18:28:11
But its consistently over valued and you can't instantly pull USD out so its not a great gauge of the price. I'm OK with using averages of many exchanges but using Gox alone isn't a good gauge. 
@_date: 2013-09-26 12:40:52
Just gotta wait 30 days and run through their verifications. After that it's instant for up to 10BTC. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 01:29:43
Damn that thing takes 700w to run? That's crazy in itself. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:00:03
However long a normal transaction takes. It's no different then sending from another wallet to another wallet
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:18:59
As said tons of times before they aren't an exchange so any new limit they introduce is to protect them from losing money. They aren't hurting anyone's ability to participate in the market, they are only affecting someones ability to do it quickly. As far as exchanges the only US based one I know of that is attempting to seek allowing USD exchanging is Crypsty. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:13:24
Yea it's quality built however the instructions could have used a bit more detail but I figured it out in the end. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:08:06
$2 per day with two 7950s? You should be getting at least 1LTC a day and be making roughly $4.21 (at current price). 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:37:05
Which makes sense since you obviously aren't running a dedicated mining rig and that's fine. I was just trying to point out that dedicated miners can still make money on GPUs provided LTC price holds out. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:08:18
Irrelevant? I'd say the price doesn't mean shit if you can't get your money out in a reasonable amount of time. There are people who have waited months to get their money out from Gox. All I'm saying is if I can't get money out in a reasonable amount of time the price shouldn't be used as a gauge. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:21:38
I mean you can't sell your BTC for USD on Gox and expect to receive it in a timely fashion. Those other methods work. 
@_date: 2013-09-27 12:49:39
Is an instant 10BTC not fast enough for you? Seriously after you do their verifications and wait through the 30 day waiting period you can buy up to 10BTC instantly. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:24:53
Good luck getting your USD out though. Their price is largely irrelevant since you can't actually get your USD back to your account. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 02:02:25
Hmmm I guess Authy is still having issues. I personally switched over to using a GA because I got tired of Authy taking their sweet time sending SMS. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:51:42
Wait are you trying to daisy chain hubs? I believe it's only going to work if you plug both hubs directly into the Raspberry Pi. Even then it may not as the Pi can be a bit picky with hubs. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:23:46
Just be patient (also doing a search here wouldn't hurt). They'll usually add you to a white list to allow further transactions to go through and honor your order at the original price. They just hired a bunch of support people so hopefully their support times will go down. 
@_date: 2013-09-19 13:50:25
Damn. It could be on Authy's side but no real way to tell as their is no live support at Coinbase. Oh well hopefully they'll fix it later today. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 20:23:06
Even at 20 they won't make ROI. But selling used ones for 35 is a great deal for the seller. 
@_date: 2013-09-21 03:18:44
You can also try PrivateInternetAccess.com. They don't keep logs (look on their site and on torrent sites that have interviewed them) and have GREAT speeds (60-100MBPS for most areas). If you pay in Bitcoin they only require an email and nothing else. Quality service with a bit more speed also has a GREAT client for Windows that anyone can use. 
@_date: 2013-09-26 12:48:03
I have a feeling it probably has to do with Authy (the service that sends the SMS). I think I said in that thread if you do get in set up Google Auth too so you have more than one way in with 2FA. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:44:09
Looks like a great place to ~~lose~~ make more money my wife will heckle me about (cough cough ASICS). Hope it's here to stay!
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:25:56
No joke. It seems like 99% of the Coinbase issues are either user error or something Coinbase fixes. I'm getting tired of people just immediately calling foul rather than trying to work it out. 
@_date: 2013-09-19 16:58:44
Thanks man! You guys are great. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:14:59
Coinbase isn't an exchange. They are simply a place you can buy and sell BTC to Coinbase. It's not like an exchange where your sell order is being fulfilled by someone else's buy order. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:18:41
Ah having them in a case doesn't help and yes I agree if you have to build a whole setup ROI is far off on alt-coins. But if you already have a mobo/cpu/PSU and just need cards it's not that far off. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:45:06
Seriously this isn't an issue with Bitpay it's an issue with someone once again trusting an ASIC company to deliver on time. When are people going to learn?
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:38:01
Solution: Just buy everything on Amazon so you don't need the Gyft app on your phone. 
In all seriousness it does seem a bit intrusive for the app but most apps are getting a little ridiculous nowadays. I just assume Google knows everything I do at this point anyways. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 18:34:46
 I don't understand why it would allow debit cards. I assume the whole purpose of allowing credit cards is so that coin base isn't out the cash when someone buys BTC but doesn't actually have enough USD to support the buy. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:28:32
Where is your evidence? I just logged in and the below screen shot is what I'm seeing. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 22:43:27
While that may be true I'd assume they just don't accept debit cards because that's not always the case and it's safer to just not allow them. 
@_date: 2013-09-24 17:27:11
It seems alot of people don't like their higher fees but I've had great luck with BTCguild. Consistent payouts and they have a nice interface as well as things like idle miner notifications. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 15:42:23
I wish people would understand your second point. I'm so tired of people posting the Gox price and acting like it's the end all be all of prices. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 11:00:06
Again I'm confused. You say you want BTC immediately and coin base does that. What's the problem?
@_date: 2013-09-24 17:29:55
Seriously it would be one of the biggest and they could certainly do it. Besides there isn't much you can't find on Amazon. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:37:19
As rough as this reply is there isn't much you can do. Take this as a lesson that you need to be using 2FA EVERYWHERE especially on your email since password resets get sent there. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:33:39
Looks like .08 (though arguably I could be reading my bill wrong). 
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:10:03
What I don't understand is why they would accept debit cards for the backup feature in the first place (I've heard some work). The whole purpose is so they get their cash if you overdraw your account and your debit could easily be linked to the same account. 
@_date: 2013-09-09 13:54:53
The question there is how did the purchase get approved. It looks like it has little to do with Coinbase and more to do with a compromised computer. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 23:17:56
I'll vouch for PIA (Private Internet Access) they take BTC with nothing more than an email and provide true log free VPN access. I believe they are based in the UK though. 
@_date: 2013-09-21 03:30:17
Highly recommended. I've got them running on my downloading/miner box. However if you need to remote access it and rely on dynamic DNS good luck. If you run the client on the box running the VPN it will jump IPs every 10-15 minutes. Great for anonymous browsing, shitty for remote access. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:44:08
No joke. How hard is it to make a secure wallet? Answer: Not hard at all. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:18:20
We'll then I apologize for your sub par experience but I've had no such issues using Armory other than the one database issue which was easily fixed. I also had it set up within a day (to allow for downloading the blockchain) and was moving coins around with no issues. It is beta software but I'm just tired of people going over the top when something doesn't work for them. Move on to another client rather than bashing a product that works fine for the majority of users.  
EDIT: Armory isn't the only game in town for offline by the way. It's just one of many options. You don't have to use web wallets just because one offline option doesn't work for you. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:28:02
I want to give you credit for not being a douche but this same scenario seems to happen between 5-10 times a week. It's getting to the point where it needs to be in the FAQ. Just a simple "Flagged as high-risk with Coinbase? Here's how to fix it."
@_date: 2013-09-19 20:58:54
I put it in the backpack and brought that too :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:20:02
Sucks man. But there are a few lessons to be learned here. 
1. Don't leave expensive items in your car. Your car is never safe. The rule of thumb is don't leave anything in your car you'd sorely miss. 
2. Don't trust all your BTC to a online wallet. Use Armory/Paper wallet. 
Again sucks to lose your money but use this as a learning experience so it doesn't happen again. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:16:04
That's also why I'm skeptical. OP knew how to come to this subreddit to complain but didn't notice what is probably close to hundreds of threads warning people not to do this exact thing? It just doesn't sound logical. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 15:31:43
But you get the coins instantly, no? Are you worried that you might over draw your bank account if you're not careful?
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:45:50
I'd hesitate to say yes. I tried a couple newer versions of Ubuntu and it would never install correctly using their script. Once I booted up 10.04 it worked flawlessly. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 19:53:21
I love that they try to pretend this is breaking news but they are days late. Nice try website. 
@_date: 2013-09-22 05:01:56
I'm pretty sure it was 30. I just broke it and I've been there about a month. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:01:07
Test it with a small amount of BTC first but you can add the address as a watch only in something like Blockchain.info and monitor the balance. However you won't be able to send without the private key and once you do send you should no longer consider it cold storage. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 12:39:28
IIRC the system that determines if you are "high risk" is completely automated and seems to have some false positives. I've heard you can email them to get whitelisted and avoid that issue in the future.     
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:19:58
I'll be that guy but rule number one when securing any sort of logical asset (software) if you allow physical access you've lost. We can all blame Coinbase or Apple or whomever but this comes down to bad security practice. You should never store large amounts of BTC in an online wallet and I'd go as far as to say you should have treated this like a real wallet. You don't carry around thousands in cash and then lose your wallet and cry foul do you?
Again sorry for your loss but there have been tons of warnings on here about this type of issue. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 01:54:15
It only takes 5 days if you're unverified. Do the verification and wait 30 days and you can instant buy up to 10BTC a day. I know waiting sucks but it works well. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:17:41
Maybe not all of them list the resolution (I'm too lazy to check them all) but it's a very common post here. Mostly they'll whitelist you and honor your purchase at the original purchase price. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:36:54
If by nightmare you mean an awesome way to quickly get "cash" then yes it's a nightmare. The fees are high but there are obviously slower ways to go from BTC -&gt; USD. It's also a great option for if you don't want to deal in person with anyone (aka localbitcoins). 
This is a situation where the fees are justified because no one is forcing you to cash out this way. 
@_date: 2013-09-14 21:17:25
Have you waited through the Coinbase waiting period yet? After that is over transfers should be instant. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:34:21

Nothing special. Just a couple of MSI Twin Frozr 7950s undervolted running a solid 650 kh/s each. I could do more at stock voltage but I wanted to save some on power consumption.

For reference take a look what happens if you search. 
These posts are getting old when there is a tried and true solution that is easy to find.
