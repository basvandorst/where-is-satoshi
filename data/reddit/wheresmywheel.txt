I have several rigs producing a total of 3.7 G/hash which gives me 70 coins per month.

I pay $.085 per kilowatt where I live. It runs me around $120 per month.
As for the production, that is the current number for this difficulty level.
I am mining with a pool (MtRed) which is PPS so I have constant payments as opposed to ups and downs. 
I could probably do a bit better with a proportional pool, but I like the consistency of PPS and supporting Reddit's pool :)

Here are my recommendations. 
HDD: Drop the Velociraptor and get a generic hard drive cheaper. Hard drive speed doesn't matter here.
Motherboard: That board only has 3 PCI-E slots, I use  in my builds and it has worked great. PCI-E slots are spaced nicely to allow 4 GPU's.
GPU: Never used HIS myself and never heard amazing things about them, may want to look into  if you can swing it. They run very cool and (mine at least) overclock very well.
Keep in mind if you are putting 4 GPU's on one board there is going to be very little space between the cards, cooling is important here.
PSU: I didn't see a PSU listed, but if you haven't picked one yet, get one with a 80+ Gold efficiency rating. Stick with good named brands; Antec, Corsair and Seasonic you cant really go wrong with. I would imagine a 750 watt PSU would give you more than enough overhead but I am always terrible at gauging wattage for builds. 
Feel free to PM me if you have any questions/concerns on it.

Agreed. I have my rigs built inside cases because I need them self contained. If I had them on a table I would go with a cheaper motherboard. I have been using those boards in my builds and haven't had any issues so that's what I recommended.
