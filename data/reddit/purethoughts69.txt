So that's like leaving your car keys in your car door. Not not only experienced car thrives can take it, ANYONE CAN! Is that your argument, because I don't see how it could be considered a good thing.

If their profit model is side chains where they would receive the transaction fees, they would be willing to sacrifice some user experience for that revenue stream.

Coinbase has not captured development
@_date: 2016-03-30 00:38:10
some here know what that means

Are you receiving any payments or other benefits from Blockstream?
@_date: 2016-03-21 15:17:40
Not anytime soon with only 1MB blocks
@_date: 2016-03-21 19:12:02
What about promoting a different protocol? It will still be Bitcoin if it uses the same Blockchain, right? So are we allowed to promote different protocols? Right now it seems not so please clarify.
@_date: 2016-03-21 19:29:38
Oh, I'm sorry you are hearing opinions you don't agree with. Maybe if you stayed further in your safe space it wouldn't happen anymore.

Freedom of Expression
@_date: 2016-03-18 15:14:39


That's because it's not the real business plan obviously.
@_date: 2016-03-21 15:53:58
I guarantee there are not 400 real users on r/bitcoin right now.

he has to tiptoe around the point to avoid being silenced
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:48:29


Lol, you need to look outside of this sub.
@_date: 2016-03-22 16:45:44
But if it reaches the 75% percent hash threshold, then isn't the legacy client now the non-consensus client?
@_date: 2016-03-11 12:19:13


Oh I didnt realize RBF (Ruin By Fee) had 95% consensus. /s
@_date: 2016-03-21 18:29:39


Lalala i m not listening to anyone else's opinion
@_date: 2016-03-31 22:04:09
Because development has been captured by corporate interests, and it's not in their best interest to do so.
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:23:52
I'm not going to tie my Bitcoins to my Reddit username to prove it to you. There lots of transactions that got stuck, so pointing out a specific one ads no value.
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:25:24
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:46:44
Because an empty block once in a while is irrelevant to the big picture. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:26:22
Perfect! Keep only one wallet on a physical disk hard drive with an incredibly hard password you don't write down and not remember. Cause I love the SFYL sob stories. Plus lost coins make my BTC worth more.  /sarcasm
@_date: 2016-06-20 03:51:54
This is not some unbelievable tale. There were lots of people posting about their transactions stuck for days. How about instead of me publishing my transaction you just browse on blochchain.info. it says when a transaction was first seen and when it confirmed. Browse for some transactions that confirmed as the mempool was dropping and you will see some of them are 48+ hours. If you still want me to dig it up for you my fee is .01 BTC. If you agree to that amount I will post it before you pay.

I used Mycelium on normal priority so fuck off and don't assume. See my reply above
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:46:59
A hindsight prediction is an oxymoron
@_date: 2016-06-19 20:05:22
I'm glad it wasn't a problem for you that I had a transaction stuck for 3 days.
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:25:14
@_date: 2016-06-20 03:18:42
I used Mycelium on normal priority Wed night. It was right as the mempool size and fee/size was soaring,and apparently my transaction got left in the dust. But I didn't know at the time to choose priority or what was happening with the network. so sorry if I don't follow the mempool size everytime I send coins. If that's what's required then BTC is useless as a payment sysyem. It confirm Saturday when the mempool size dropped. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 03:22:54
Dude there are literally thousands of transactions from Wed night that didn't confirm for days.

Show me your Bitcoins and I'll show you mine
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:51:39
Try an hour. I put a Mycelium normal priority fee last week as the mempool was rising and I guess fees were rising faster than it updated and my transaction got left behind and didn't confirm till Sunday. If I was a new user I would have been freaking out. Not knowing if the transaction would confirm or drop off the mempool is an unacceptable experience.
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:26:59
So it looks like a small rise above 3TPS causes a huge traffic jam that continues to pile up. This does not look like spam to me at all
@_date: 2016-06-17 01:18:40
That link doesn't even mention "high-fee spam"
@_date: 2016-06-24 01:33:56
unfortunately I doubt it
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:21:57
Ya, so as the TPS is rising the fee estimates are also rising. So if the transaction doesnt confirm right away it gets left behind. That's what I experienced. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:58:52
I get your point about it could be lost, however gold melts at 1950 degrees F so it wouldn't just melt in a fire. Nor would it stay that hot while it flows away in a sewer.
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:46:39


How in the world can you assume people paying more to help (albeit sometimes unsuccessfully) ensure their transactions confirm is "high-fee spam"
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:07:54
Core,  this is unacceptable. Raise block limit now
@_date: 2016-05-23 23:00:09
No, people will leave bitcoin. And the scope of Bitcoin's use cases will shrink.
@_date: 2016-05-23 23:10:51
You sure that "incentive" won't just push them away from Bitcoin? Because IRL that's what I'm seeing
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:58:17


And what they are told to work on by their employers.
@_date: 2016-05-24 12:39:57
Of course. All blocks would be transaction blocks.
@_date: 2016-05-24 14:13:02
Everyone who owns the crypto has incentive to run a node to benefit from POS mining
@_date: 2016-05-24 12:13:02
Many options.
Proof of Stake mining for one.
@_date: 2016-05-23 23:22:14
Plus I doubt this African villager is mining so he can use a light client
@_date: 2016-07-12 11:54:20
I think 45 for public opinion then 45 for decision?

Practically if you are waiting on payment for a time sensitive action you can know the funds are secured.
@_date: 2016-07-22 02:17:16


That would be the buyer. You generate your own private keys with your password. You give them the encrypted private key, but not the password so they can't steal funds.
