I assume by your nickname that you are probably from the Balkans?
Maybe there is interest in the other languages you are speaking, since Austria has always been close to its neighbours.

I understand, but all those facts make me only understand why there are huge benefits in mining in China, but it doesn't explain away the costs benefits of the other countries and the lack of mining there. 
I always thought China would have unmatchable prices in electricity, so i was surprised to see other countries with good infrastructure like the UAE offer almost the same conditions (except ASICs, it seems)
