It's actually kind of brilliant that if you could go back in time and buy BTC, you could keep the private keys with you.

I keep seeing a strong correlation between short account age and nonsense posted here. Did you really just learn about reddit less than 2 months ago?
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:19:22
The internet is complicated. Your keyboard is complicated. Your monitor is complicated. But you made a comment here on Reddit, and it wasn't very complicated.
A ton of layers of abstraction make complicated things easier, and it takes a lot of time to build those layers.
You basically have two good options for crypto-currencies in this early stage: Sit back and enjoy watching it be invented (meme's, etc), or get involved and help make it better (posts like this, writing code, etc). It'll be complicated for a long time.

what do you mean by bidirectional channels? I've never heard that before with LN
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:35:02
If Bob and Alice open up that channel with .1 btc each, can someone elce (connected to Bob) pay Alice a higher amount? Like 5 btc? 
My understanding is no, they can't...
But if so, then does Bob and Alice's channel have a higher capacity (5.2 btc)?

Can anyone who knows more about this verify that there's no code/idea coming in reverse? Even if it's not byte for byte? Why not?

I set up a crypto derby racing app for fun and was thinking it could be a cool project to use the Lightning Network for, and could probably help generate some PR around how it helps scale Bitcoin. 
Bets could be placed in real-time, using micro-transactions. If you or any other devs want to help create a LN backend for it let me know! 
Here's URL for it:  (I just put it up today)

TL;DR how ethereum was destroyed by a cat app?
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:42:31
Hey guys! This project started out as a way to visualize Bitcoin's prices in real time, relative to the other top cryptos on coinmarketcap. I turned the data into an arcade derby for fun.
I am thinking it could be a fun interface to set up real time bets using the Lightning Network testnet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:33:26
Ha. I haven't done due diligence on researching eth, but the whole notion of a turing complete language on a blockchain seemed like it would run into this exact problem... Hopefully they thought it through a bit more.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:40:52
Listening to Bitcoin "experts" talk about it on TV confirms that most people definitely don't know what it is beyond the price.

I'm not op but I don't, can you tl;dr what's wrong about that?
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:53:32
Yeah but at least Apple kemed the header. Which is the thing that really breaks the Bitcoin one. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:24:45
With the transparency/being able to audit where your BTC is stored, is a huge fundamental difference from a conventional bank. 
Wait, and yeah the instant and cheap part too. If you're not familiar with a number of scenarios Bitcoin is much faster here's one: I have residence in the USA and am currently in France - if I deposit a check here it takes ~5 weeks to clear.
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:38:11
The "bizarre scenario" is literally the context of your original comment. I'm not necessarily a huge bitcoin advocate, but yes I believe the consensus/blockchain technology in various formats (likely in a currency format) will be used by a significant % of the population. Just like e-mail is today. 
Surly you must be trolling?
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:27:39
What risk? Genuinely curious what you associate as a risk here, and what a "miner's fee swapped" means. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:03:59
Don't you see you're arguing the same thing as postal service vs. email? 
Email would be silly compared to the postal service unless everyone was using it. 
That's the whole context of this discussion.
@_date: 2014-09-20 16:57:27
PayPal is 2.9% for the merchant. Receiving on larger invoices ends up with  hundreds of dollars in fees. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 20:21:20
Bank transfers are indeed great for sending/receiving from subcontractors and regular clients, but for single time clients and projects I would think it would be a bit excessive (and a bit odd of a request) to set up... I end up usually just eating the credit card fee on most of them. Or waiting weeks for the "check in the mail". 
I haven't brought up bitcoin as a payment method to any clients (if they bring it up then I would accept it), it seems a long time away from being able to be used regularly for stuff like this. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:46:42
When the insurance is enough security it's not any different, that's certainly true.
So instead of writing the check they would send bitcoin to a Neo address. I could see the confirmation, and know my money was secure. 
This is assuming bitcoin is widely adopted. Right? Of course these things are more-or-less irrelevant now. 
With wiring money it's time and cost (like the original point of email vs letters). With cash it is both the risk of carrying large amounts of cash, and it doesn't get it back to the USA.

@_date: 2014-09-20 17:13:17
Yeah I guess I missed the point you were making, which is very true that Paypal is still better for the consumer. 
As a freelancer, when collecting larger amounts of money I try to avoid using credit cards, but there's so much delay and hassle around using checks. Basically I wish there was some instant, low cost way to send and receive larger amounts money. Especially over longer distances. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:31:42


Can you expand a little on what you meant by "proof" in your title?
@_date: 2014-10-06 06:04:08
No, the wall is set up in the other direction – keeping the price from going above 300.
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:30:26
Well let's be realistic here, at that point it's briefcase not a wallet. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:53:20

The Satoshi quote you referenced is taking about full nodes, not mining... You're both wrong :)
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:56:53
Full nodes and mining are two totally different things. This seems to be confusing to a lot of people!
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:26:46
Where did you get that idea from?
"A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node."
What's would be the purpose of others connecting to it, if not to verify transactions?

But seriously though liquidity and trust is hard to build, it's not entirely about the tech
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:04:31
When I set up architecture for streaming exchange data, I had one server purely set up to accept the stream and write to redis. That way the load on it never changed. then the public streaming API was set up so it could scale up and depending on traffic, but all it did was read from redis so it was very efficient under load (and instances could turn on/off with no consequence)

Secondary PSA: there were a lot of posts saying this same thing 3 years ago, before a 2-year downward trend in price.
Granted it still bottomed out above the start of that bull run.

It accepts ฿, prices are just posted in lazy fiat

What is a "pretender" when it comes to having currency? I don't really understand your comment.
Edit: the conjugate of pretender is kinda interesting in this context, is what you are referring to?

BTC is the only accepted payment method, actually.
Shopify doesn't let me display prices in BTC, I am seeing if I can get it to. Maybe I just need to ditch Shopify since I am getting this same feedback a lot.

I run a print shop and am going to do a run of these shirts. Let me know if you have any questions. If you order today they'll arrive after Christmas (it'll take 5-10 business days), just in case any of you are buying as presents.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:28:10
Yeah, I run a screen print shop that is printing them. I set it up as an experiment to see how the new Shopify BTC integration works. 
I had to write a little add-on to get the prices to actually display in BTC though, since it's not built in (I have a little javascript code that connects the BitPay API and switches it from USD to BTC)... I e-mailed Shopify about adding it as a displayable currency.

@_date: 2013-12-20 23:46:55
That makes sense. I am working on getting some pages up that explains the details and contact info, etc. I was eager to post it and get feedback on the designs.
For your questions: company is in Olympia, WA, we can ship internationally, and if you order now they will arrive a little after Christmas in case you wanted to get them as x-mas gifts. They are high quality, and screen printed, so it takes a few days to get them out the door.

It's a water based screen print, very nice quality. Similar soft-hand feel to DTG but way brighter and more wash-resistant.

Sure it's very unlikely that the INTERNET would go down.. but possibly an area's (or an individual shop) connection could go down for a while. Probably not all of Belgium which I guess is the point here. But even so there are plenty of ways to have individual backups, at least where I am, like 4G.
