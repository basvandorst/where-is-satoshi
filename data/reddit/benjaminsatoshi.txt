Wow this is really incredible. Thanks for posting this, probably my favorite Reddit post in years.
Hope you and your grandfather have much success and happiness!

I don't know it's just that. Bcc didn't contain much real value during it's short life. That value rushing back to bitcoin could have spurred a run but I doubt it's all just bcc sell pressure.
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:12:51
That's true, and I hadn't really considered that beforehand.
 While i still believe that overall, bcash destroyed value, You've at least given me something to think about, thanks.

The size of chips used in asic miners (and cpus) has reached the physical limit very recently at 14nm. Until today, it's only profitable to mine if you had big money to throw into farms to stay ahead of the curve (ie buy the latest asics which were getting closer and closer to 14nm) and if you get next to free electricity (many farms in china have state subsidized electricity).
Soon, with this physical limit reached, mining will be more competitive as asic manufacturers won't be tempted to hold on to their newest chips because they won't have the same advantage in terms of hashrate.
Plainly speaking, it's about to be more profitable to sell miners to consumers than to mine privately with them. 
Tldr; it's profitable for large players but soon the market will be more competitive.

Would you cut off your nose to save your face, too?
E: Eric, I will reiterate here that I am a greatful of your work in bitcoin and I value your opinions, yet I respectfully disagree.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:20:08
Okay, interesting points you have there. Tell me again how consensus is impossible across millions all while the millions in the bitcoin network remain in consensus? Humans can't come to consensus across numbers like these but networked machines can. The fact that "consensus rules" are (basically) impossible to change is a feature of bitcoin, not a bug to be "fixed."
The rest of your post could be summarized to: we need a hostile takeover of bitcoin.
Significantly large majority = democracy = not bitcoin

There is a difference between political authority (BU) and technical authority (Core). This is like saying master chefs should not have menus, they don't know what their own guests enjoy.
These people have assisted in building the entire protocol; I trust thruth and code.

Is localbitcoins.com still site wide banned on reddit or was that just a fluke?
@_date: 2017-04-02 08:14:02
Now your comments start to read like a vaguely shrouded threat against those that are pro-segwit (aka pro scaling). The best part though is that it's an empty threat! 
Tell me, if consensus is impossible and not even currently achievable, why are there "so many" excruciatingly vocal hard fork proponents attempting to bolster their numbers? 
Is it because without consensus the hard fork proponents would fork themselves off the network and find that their attack was largely a waste of money? 
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:40:23
You must live in a strange reality...
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:26:40
Right, and there it is. You are not interested in bitcoin's success.
Your people are interested in bitcoins destruction, most knowingly, some not.
@_date: 2017-04-04 10:36:44
It is a digital trust network which imputes HUGE value. More value here than mere ornamental.
@_date: 2017-04-04 10:38:00
Exactly. Those trying to use simple majority for hostile takeover are going to fail.
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:28:31
A hard fork would need to have consensus in order to occur. It is obvious by now that a hard fork will not get consensus as many of the most apt minds in bitcoin reject the proposal on technical grounds. Without consensus on the change, a hard fork is a divergence in the blockchain, splitting the minority group from the majority. BU/Hard Fork/BUCoin is a bluff pure and simple because if they follow through they will be the minority group diverging from bitcoin.
Constantly implying inevitability is a propaganda technique which I'm sure you would never purposely bring into a technical discussion. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 04:35:00
A hard fork is a hard fork is a hard fork. Eric I know you disagree with us but many of us will reject a hard fork no matter what. You are intelligent and I do have respect for you, it just hurts to see you taking up arms on the non-technical side of this conversation.

Some think it will, others think it wont. It is difficult to say at this point. The idea is that right now bitcoin is a giant pool of money that actually consists of big block value and small block value. Since small blocks won the Bitcoin name and network, the big block advocates are going to remove their value from bitcoin and put that value into the alternative crypto, bitcoinCash effectively creating a new money and new supply of that money.
Another way to say it is bitcoin's supply is being "doubled." When supply doubles, and demand stays the same, price halves. The caveat is that the bitcoinCash tokens aren't really bitcoin so their value will hit 0 relatively fast
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:45:33
I really doubt that. The US loves seizing assets any way it can, legal or not.

Probably satoshi would be targeted by old fashioned character assassination like the current development team. 
Also, there's a chance he would face criminal charges for facilitating freedom, now a huge crime in the United States.

Id like to agree here, it seems you are factually correct and this could be possible.
However, I seriously doubt the US Fed Gov would announce anything publicly unless they had complete control over the server, domain, coins, and "criminals."

Okay, so governments and special interests around the globe hate bitcoin but they can't come right out and say it. Instead, they have tried to wrest control away from the users into the hands of their personal lapdogs by attacking the network in various creative ways. The latest attack, Bitcoin Unlimited, crumbled under the weight of it's own deficiencies about 2 months ago.
Those same groups are on to the next "plan," even though it will also fail. They are driving up the altcoin prices so they can point to bitcoin's lost confidence. What they don't see is how the market soon is going to facefuck the ether price into the dirt while the "harmonic" cryptos March off together into the sunrise.
This is my prediction for the next 2 years.
