Friend, you linked to an “out of stock” product and some fragments of Python code.
Anyways, I’ll block you for now so I can focus on writing the actual how-to documentation for this.

I posted a tutorial here 
It has links to many helpful YouTube videos.

Thanks for the tip, I’ll transfer it to my son. He’ll be thrilled!
I like the idea of using a no-backlight e-ink display (the always-on LED lights can be annoying at night.)

I really like these ideas. I don't think I'm in a position to mass produce these widgets, but I made this tutorial to make them easier to build

Sure, I don’t see why not! There’s nothing particular about the Raspberry Pi Zero

It works for current price in the smallest complication
