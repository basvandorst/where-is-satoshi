Given the type of equipment the large majority of software and tech companies distribute to their employees these days, it’s probably pretty close to true. If they can make it work on a phone or tablet, they can make it work on a laptop.

I bought about .8 worth of hashpower on HashNest, mined .3 bitcoin over the course of a few months. Then I sold my hashpower back for about .7. So all in all I made .2 btc out of .1 - it’s possible to turn a profit. It’s just much more expensive for the same hashpower as a real miner.

Full disclosure, I am a software developer. Maybe not for mobile apps in my current position, but I had to build a few in college. When you’re developing a mobile app, you’re executing code on a SIMULATED device that is being run by your desktop operating system. This is exactly what things like Corona SDK and XCode simulator are for on Mac. 
Think about it. When you have to develop an app that works on 15 different devices, are you going to have 15 fucking phones and tablets sitting around? No. You switch devices in the simulator and test that way. Testing on actual devices is QA’s job.
Either way, you don’t just develop a mobile app on the device itself.

Anyone who would reject Kanye’s statements took them out of context and made no attempt to comprehend what he meant. What the intent was behind his words. Why are there videos of black people, even other black rappers, saying they understand what he is saying? Stop virtue signaling. The fact that Kanye isn’t allowed to have the opinions he’s expressing is EXACTLY the type of mental prison he’s talking about. People talking about putting out a hit on him? For speaking his mind? What the fuck, man. How many of these rappers were hanging with Trump and dropping his name in their songs before the Democratic party told them he was a racist?
Listen to the whole TMZ interview and not just the out of context clip. You are living in a mental prison right now, thinking what the media tells you to think about Kanye. I bet you think he’s crazy and should be locked up, huh? I bet you don’t see the danger in that way of thinking either, huh?

Contributing or developing something for bitcoin doesn’t necessarily mean creating a startup. That’s pretty much the opposite of contributing to an open source project. You’re benefitting from it, not contributing to it.

To outnumber a system and yet still allow it to control your life truly does require people to be in a mental prison. Bitcoin can be the end of financial slavery if people can leave their mental prisons and realize they are the ones in control.

@_date: 2018-05-08 06:32:46
Yeah it has to do with crypto, because Kanye tweeted “decentralize” among all his other twitter rants. Then you said we don’t want him to advocate for bitcoin. Why?
I mean look at you, you’re ignoring anything good that comes out of his mouth because you disagree with him on one or two things. Maybe you just disagree with *how* he said it. But you let the media tell you how to think and feel about someone. You are incapable of letting a thought or idea stand on its own. If I’m crazy and Kanye is crazy, is Slim Thug crazy? Is Candace Owens crazy? Is EVERYONE you disagree with crazy?
That is absolutely a MENTAL. PRISON. What if YOU’RE the one who is going crazy?

You know, the left is just like a woman. When they are right, they will argue the point as logically as possible and avoid any logical fallacies. But when they're wrong, they will argue from the most emotional and illogical place possible and pull out all the logical fallacies just to get under your skin and make you angry. You're doing it right now, using ad hominem to discredit my point because I happen to disagree with you on something completely irrelevant to the topic we're discussing.
There is absolutely a reason we need Male Rights Advocacy. I don't see anyone fighting for gender equity in the world's suicide rate, for example. Males very disproportionately succeed in ending their lives. They very disproportionately fail in getting custody of their children. But all we care about is how much money women are making, when these other issues could potentially do far more harm than us making more money. Which can also be accounted for by the fact that statistically, men work far more dangerous jobs and take less time for parental leave.
Now, MGTOW is just a bunch of guys who feel that they've been so hurt and fucked over by women that they decide not to be involved with them romantically anymore. That's kind of bitter and beta, yeah. But like I'm trying to argue, that's not the same as MRA.

You are doing a great job of demonstrating the stigma around talking about this.
If the genders were perfectly equal and no privilege existed, both the rape and suicide rates would be equal as well. Extrapolate if you must, on just *how* we would achieve that goal. Using your own logic, a higher rape rate of women means we need more men to be raped. I'd suggest that it simply means we need less women to be raped, just as we need fewer men to commit suicide.

Then there are other industries that have had multiple bubbles. Real estate has had many, but ultimately people always need shelter, so it's not like it's going anywhere. The stock market has had bubbles, but ultimately more companies grow and make more and more money. I guess we have to ask ourselves if people will always NEED cryptocurrency, or is our current monetary system, where the whole world is in debt, working well enough?
It certainly isn't ready for the type of adoption we were seeing in December...so that was all speculation.

Yeah I think we’re all here to hedge our bets against the financial system friend. I’m holding until it’s no longer meaningful to measure bitcoin by its worth in fiat. It’s just good to know that I haven’t actually lost significant money until the price goes below my dollar cost average of around a thousand or so. I haven’t bought any bitcoin to hold since it was under $5k. I did use the crazy December rally to increase my bonus from work though.

Two weeks to a month is more common. So a week to a month of possibly thinking about killing yourself, or an indefinite amount of time craving something that is killing you...it's a trade off that was worth it for me.

Is there a guarantee that paper money will be useful in 10 or 100 years time? We’re already getting to the point where cash is less convenient than its digital form. Plastic is quicker, and now we have ways to pay with our phones becoming more widespread. Wouldn’t it be useful to have a digital form of currency that is actually backed up by something and isn’t centralized to banking corporations? There are still a lot of really smart people saying it will. The internet saw a huge bubble of people who didn’t really get it, and now 20 years later, the shit that marked peak hubris during that time, like buying pet supplies online from a company with Super Bowl ad time, doesn’t really seem as silly anymore. We just use Amazon instead of Pets.com. Amazon went for the slow and steady growth that could scale. They were like the Bitcoin of the Internet bubble.

Did every human on earth lose money if they didn't buy Bitcoin at all? Then I didn't lose any from not selling at the peak. If I bought a bitcoin at $1k and I sold at $19k, but then one day it goes to 25k, your logic would say I "lost" 5k. But I would have made over $18,000 on my investment...so how does that make any sense? Because my crystal ball didn't predict that extra 5k, it's lost? No. You don't lose or gain anything until you SELL. I still have the potential to make that money and more if the price rises again. I have not locked in any gains or losses.

Likewise, people do not have to understand cryptography to use a currency. Cryptography is already used in the financial industry.

You don’t have a bitcoin wallet at an exchange like that. What you have is an IOU for the bitcoin the exchange is holding for you in their massive account(s). So it never has to go on chain unless you’re sending it to a wallet address outside of the exchange. Think of it like transferring money between two accounts at the same bank. The money didn’t actually have to go anywhere, they just changed some numbers in a database.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:02:34


is what you said. Guess you’ll need to give me your definition of “more expensive” if it doesn’t mean “the price went up”...
Again, the price you bought at and the price you sell at are all that matters. People who bought a house in 2007 didn’t make or lose any money on their investment unless they sold their house at some point. They pay back the money the bank gave them to buy the house at the 2007 price. When they sell, they keep their equity and profit over what they owe. The rest goes back to the bank, and the next buyer gets a new loan for the current value of the house.
Nothing about the current price of your home matters or affects you in any way unless you are buying it or selling it. Just like bitcoin.

The way you’re thinking is the way people are thinking about bitcoin. That they should be able to fit the entire brick and mortar bank in their pocket, literally.

Yes, my statement is correct, but the article says to multiply 21 million by .008 to get the number of bitcoin in circulation or something.

I never downplayed the value of anonymity in general. Just that anonymity for legal reasons wasn’t needed here and Bitcoin provides enough anonymity for plausible deniability when it comes to other people you wouldn’t want knowing.
Perhaps you could explain why, if prostitution is legal at the bunny ranch, someone would have an investigation on them that would uncover their transaction to begin with? Like a private investigator? I’d think they’d need to do something else illegal for such a probe into their financial history to take place. For that illegal transaction maybe they could use Monero.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:42:35
I didn’t say that though. I said it has recovered from similar patterns in the past. 
As in, the number of times it has recovered far outnumbers the number of times it has crashed and never come back. Granted, it only takes once.
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:25:35
First you’ll have to understand what a resistance point is. They’re saying 8k has been the point of resistance around 9 times since the big “crash”. Once the price hits 8k, sell orders flow in like mad. In order for it to keep going, people have to really believe it will keep going up. Which will take a lot of investor confidence given how many time that 8k resistance point has been tested.
6,500 is the other resistance point. Buy orders don’t seem to allow it to go any lower, because investors are confident it won’t go much lower, and that’s a good point to buy in.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:07:45
Not to mention that prostitution is legal in that part of Nevada, so there’s really no need for anonymity in a legal sense.
