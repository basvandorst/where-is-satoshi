Draws soooooo much power.. I wish they would have made a usb stick.. :(
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:46:47
I was.. the power draw is just too much for me.. 400 watts is pretty much my max now a days for mining. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:43:49
Nothing really lol.

It is probably more expensive to do that LOL.  They don't make anything about a 50 cent bill, well.. use too.. They don't give me C-tire monies anymore after I buy stuff :(.  I've always hoped C-tire made their own crypto.

Kind of.  There is no immunity to the lead pipe decryption method.  The gov's only real weapon... 
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:48:04
This unfortunately.  I was really hoping for a 2-400 watt power draw.. I would "over" pay relatively to the S9 for that.  ROI on a hobby miner is of little concern to me.  Using 900 watts though.. that is just too much power mang :(. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:35:49

My co-workers husband is a huge gamer and I asked her about Bitcoin, he said he thought it was a scam.  This was in 2014..I have never rubbed it in her face was wrong though, she wasn't trying to call it a scam just mentioned he did not like it effectively.  Everyone is asking me what I think of bitcoin now adays.. Everyone in my office is rather bullish on bitcoin.

I feel if I was running a business and the gov forced me to do things I did not want to and then my business is being blamed for doing those things, it would really bother me as the business owner.  Perhaps I am incorrect and they don't need to hold it but are just because.  I probably won't have an answer for a little bit.

I have done nothing Illegal, I plan to pay capital gains. There is no reason I though I would need to do this.  BTC skyrocketed and I could sell off some to put a down payment on a house.  I never want to sell all of it for reasons exactly like this.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:27:05

This is my exact plan.  Pretty much the reason I created this post.  I have taken screen shots of all my TX and am hoping that will work out.  The bank does seem very willing to help.  It really seems to me like KYC has tied their hands and they cannot do much.

It's more like I sent a package in the mail that is suppose to take 20 days and it's only a 12 hour drive away because they need to take the package and hold it in their ware house for 19 days.

whoa whoa.. I did not say that either.. If crypto is over 80% of your total net worth.. you should really take a step back and consider wtf you are doing with your life.  
My tatic is something like , it hits 90%, sell of 35%, rinse repeat. 
it goes to $1mill a coin, I'm laughing, it goes to zero, I'm not devastated and probably made out very well.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:18:19

I know what you're saying
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:03:00
Like to a wallet?
Make an offline wallet first this means creating a wallet on a computer that will never touch the internet.  You can do this by buying a hard drive, disconnect your Ethernet cable, pulling out your wireless card if you have one and running windows via the CD.  Download bitaddress.org to a cd and run it on the offline computer creating an offline wallet.   Or download the core wallet and creating a wallet on the offline computer either would work.  Then burn that wallet to a CD.  DO NOT USE USB's they are not safe.  You can use a USB once you move the files to an online computer as long as the wallets are encrypted well.  
You could also could just buy a trezor or some hardware wallet and transfer it to that if you are not feeling adventurous. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:29:33
100%.  If it goes to $20 it's because ETH or some new coin has completely destroyed bitcoin or SHA-256 has been cracked.

Use blockchain.info to follow the trail.. alas taking a gander.. it seems.. they have moved a lot.. :S.. Yet another case of why wallets should be created on an offline computer.
You might be able to trace them to an exchange and go that way.

Absolutely not I encrypted the shit out of it.  I always wished BTC had a minimum payout for the exact reason you stated as yes the odds are eventually they will all be lost. When I say min payout I mean like 100 micro bits very small.  It will never happen though.   IT has to do with the public / private key relationship.  In order to send the coins I need to sign the transaction with the private key which.. I heavily encrypted and lost the password because I am a tool lol.  I thought not writing it down and memorizing it was a good idea.. it wasn't..  I do plan on posting them on here though just to see if anyone is in the mood to try to break it lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:48:51
Same reason I watched it go from $1200 to $200, fear.  From everyone calling me asking how to buy litecoin.. I am thinking there is about 2-4 weeks before we start a bear market.  I am guessing 2-6 year bear market, leaning towards 5 years.

@_date: 2017-12-01 18:38:51
So if it pulls back you can buy more if it explodes you will still be set.  This is assuming though that you invested a decent amount to start.  If you threw $1 and turned it into $100 okay there isn't really a point.  If you threw $1k in and turned it into $100k.. well.. If btc went to 1 million you would have 10 mill OR 9 mill and $10k in cash... What is the extra mil really going to do?

Investing if you are a millionaire and are just trying to increase your wealth.  If you are a poor shit like most people.. high risk and high reward is THE ONLY way you are ever going to retire.  No one sub 40 is going to be retiring with out millions in their pocket.  They will work till they die, pensions will dry up.

The idea people will spend millions to verify transactions for free.. is something only fools would believe.  TX fees will hopefully be enough to keep people mining.. BTC will have to be insane in value for this to hold true.  I am betting on that happens.

There isn't much risk in showing people your public key.  The risky part is.. BTC jumps 100 000 times in value and people know you have one and jump you for it.. There is zero defense to the lead pipe decryption method.

I don't see the extra return from it being a collectors item worth what it brings you in sentimental joy.  If in 10 years BTC is worth $500,000k and there is zero extra value for the coin who cares you lost $1k.  You got to keep that fancy coin, show it off, etc in the mean time.  There is something to be said for sentimental value. (Like if coin is worth 1 mill in USD in BTC but someone is going to pay 10 mill for an un used cash coin well shit then ya okay but $1,000.00 *shurgs* IMO)

You could buy freshly mined coins, they will be expensive, I don't see why you really need to do that besides the cool factor but lets not kid ourselves it is pretty freaking cool.  I have mined coins from an altcoin it's pretty neat to see it in the wallet.

If it ever became big enough what ever country they are storing it will just raid them and take all their gold just like bitgold in the 90's.  Gold has zero value it is only worth a ton because we all agree it is worth something thus it is.  This is why bitcoin has large value.. it is better than gold in almost every aspect.

TX fees are way to high for BTC to be used to trade for stuff.  IMO this will cause another bear market, many will get decimated unfortunately.  The tech will be created to do something insane like 100 000tps on a 1mb Block, this will cause another massive bull market.  The future is bright but to pretend the TX fees are okay right now is just not right.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:14:37

It takes awhile for the average person to realize money is just an idea, that scares them they go to gold, the price flys up, everyone thinks they are a genius.

That isn't a proper comparison... Any business that would make it's money back in months and be turning profit that quickly.. it would be wise to throw every single penny you have at it...  If you buy the miners and the price falls to $1k you are still going to get your money back.  If you buy BTC and it takes to $1k.. you better hope it rises again.

We have to wait for the tech to be created to make it so TX don't fill up so much space.  Odds are this will create a bear market and the price will correct until the tech is created and then it will rise again.  THIS IS THE BEST PATH FORWARD, just jacking up the block size to something silly like 100mb to keep this bull run going is a very bad not good idea.

You cannot mine bitcoin with GPU but you can mine Dash and a few others. 
It sounds like you do not believe BTC will be going up, I would say do not buy as you will not hold, nor should you mine.  Pretend it never existed.  If you don't think it will be worth $100k BTC isn't for you as you are not a trader.

*Edit 1*
Email sent, grammatical errors... not good at English.. *shrugs* , however:
Email Title: Cryptocurrency, TD and BMO
Body, Hello, I am wiring this e-mail to voice my opinion that what these banks are doing shouldn't be legal. 
See the sub reddit below.
  
I believe we should be pro bitcoin as a country and was under the impression we already are.  I was hoping perhaps a bill that could to make it Illegal for banks to stop the flow of their customers money unless dictated by the law.  Thus if they wanted to stop something Illegal or bad from happening they would get the law involved instead of trying to be the police / deciders of what you cannot do with your money themselves.  To me the idea of the big banks getting together and deciding what people cannot spend their money on is a dangerous idea.

The value would utterly skyrocket.  
The ecom might not necessarily crash, Say for the American Ecom.  I cannot see how one loses reserve status without a serious bump in the road. 
The transaction limit would max out for sure.. It would cost a lot to send coins.  Perhaps in a few more years allowing 100mb or even 1gb blocks might be very viable and the TX/sec issue becomes obsolete.  Currently this is an issue, I don't believe it is as big as people make it out to be.  Work is being done to up the TX/sec without increasing block size which would be nice.

Told about BTC at $70,
Here about it again at $600,
Go full on fear of missing out, takes two weeks to get signed up to exchange, start buying at $1200.. then $800 then $600 then $400.. then $200 (God I wish  I bought more than 1 btc at 200...) Accepted all my alt coins would be worth $0 and I may watch everything I dumped into BTC go to zero.
BTC passes $1k..
BTC passes $5k, I want laser eye surgery, sell 1 btc.
BTC hits $10k, sell 1 BTC
BTC passes $20k CANADIAN, unload 30% of my crypto holdings.
At this point I cannot lose(like right now, I can no longer lose), I have IN CASH around 8x what I have invested and still have a very large amount in crypto.
Never sell it all, I WILL NEVER SELL IT ALL EVER, don't wait for one price sell in steps.

THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS.. Bitcoin will be the tool of freedom... or the tool that enslaves everyone.. There will be no middle ground.. IT really ahs started a war.. the two sides are people should be free and people should be 100% control and their entire wealth can be shutdown if anything bad is said against the supreme leader. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:07:28
Your optimism will sink you.. Everyone I know that bought in at $1200 sold at $800, mentioned I should of sold with them at $800 when it was $200 and now tell me good job as it is $4000
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:38:36
No, they are on two separate chains now.  So when you move the coins on the segwit chain the cash chain will deny the request and they will stay there.  Kind of like this &gt;&gt;
Coins on paper wallet &gt;&gt; Import paper wallet to bitcoin core&gt;&gt; Send coins to new paper wallet&gt;&gt; Bitcoin relays transaction &gt;&gt; Bitcoin Cash denys it &gt;&gt; Bitcoins now on new wallet, Bitcoin cash still on old &gt;&gt; Get bitcoin cash wallet and import private key &gt;&gt; Bamzo

@_date: 2017-09-01 19:26:00
No, absotely not... the tune here is reminding me a lot of 2013.. it scares me.  All those people that are "waiting" for it to dip 50% to buy more, are actually doing the opposite.. Odds are if it dips that low all those people will actually sell at a heavy lose to cover their bets driving it insanely low for a very brief period of time.. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:14:28
NO and most believe it will not which is why it will sting and hard.  The idea BTC can only go up is the exact reason it will crash.  Just like the dot com bubble.  IT IS WISE TO NOTE if you had the balls to hold through the dot com bubble you probably did very well.  As I have said though the biggest shit talkers about how the most they can lose is what they put in and they will buy more when it drops all freaked out and sold at a minor 30% correction.. when it fell to $200 not a single person wanted to buy.. I mentioned it daily.. now I have people calling me asking how to invest.. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:09:44
Yes.  Corrections happen, and I bet this form will turn into a cry fest very soon.  I will not be selling but I bet over 50% of the people here will not survive a 50% correction.

This is a GREAT post..  There really is 0% guarantee BTC will ever go to $20k again.. it could just sit between like $5k - $10k for ever and be an item of traders.. I don't think so but it could.

That is not completely true.  It's they don't have to give you the exact money back.  Ruling was from the early 1910's I believe when the bank stole(OH THEY FING STOLE IT) buddies collectible coins and gave him their shitty notes back a few months later.  The bought out gov ruled in favour of the banks..
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:00:13
A price you believe a certain item will fall to or below so you set a buy order at that price.  AKA I have a buy order to  buy 1 BTC at $2k USD. If anyone wants to sell at that I will buy 1 BTC a that price.  
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:03:35
I do wish BTC had a min payout like Joulecoin but it does not soo ya.  They just sit there unused for ever and it HAS to be this way.. has to.  One powerful idea of BTC is I can freeze myself for 1 thousand years until the tech is around to make me immortal and I will still have access to wealth when I am revived.  This is one crazy use of BTC people joke about.. but aren't joking about.

I believed BTC would be around for a long time and still do.. HOWEVER I think it is very wise to expect $2k.. if it never hits it Fing amazing if it does you were ready.

If you are using an exchange the exchange owns the coins not you.  NEVER think otherwise.

What part of the bubble though.. the beginning and we go to $50k then down to $15k.. cause.. if you buy now you won't be upset at all when that bubble pops. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:33:17

Depends on the machine they might be doing that there.  There are locating services that find me locations actually.  I have found a few myself as well, I just go to each location and ask if they want one.. Most people say no so one has to be prepared for that.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:31:23
Just some whale cashing out.. they will regret it.  Be it in 3 days or 3 years.
@_date: 2017-05-03 12:57:58
I won't be cashing it all out ever :) ;). Plan is to sell 2 BTC at $10k USD, 1 for me 1 for the party. hehehe.
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:03:50
TA says buying at ATH's is actually a pretty good idea... the run from here is unknown.. $200 to $400 would of been amazing.

I started buy DEC 2013....... $1200.. 1000.. 800.. 600..400..200..

If BTC hits under $100 it is over for BTC has another coin has taken the lead.

You can 100% just let the thing sync and you will be good to use the coins.

You held!! yes most people would sell at the bottom in Jan at $200 and be buying back now like suckers at $3k then reselling when we have a mini correction to $2k and re buying again at $3k.. poor "traders" 
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:05:31
Cannot agree enough with this... I bought in DEC 2013.. and all the way down.. HODLING for the win

I don't see how you retire on 1/2 a mill.. 
I would highly consider selling half for a house or putting it in high dividend ETF's.  I don't think the ride is over yet but you now don't pay rent as the dividends will cover it or you own a house, but there is taxes and maintenance with a house.  Then work part time and be balling lol, perhaps bar tending or something.
Hodl like a champ till 10k and sell of 1/4 and put it dividend funds and retire on those bad awesome dividends!

GPU is blown apparently.  I tried 3 different batteries different chargers, tried hard reset power on, power on several times, went to two phone stores.  The guy at the last phone store said he has seen it before after the OS upgrade if gaming, I was playing Clash and it just shut down.. did it twice second time couldn't get it back on..  Got a cool sky phone for $160 though, I am really liking it so far.

@_date: 2017-06-06 20:07:33
Same, I started buying in DEC 2013 and bought all the way down to $200..  I remember for a solid 6 months my friend would ask about BTC and I would says 200-220 it was between, he was pretty bullish it was holding steady.  He obviously now regrets not getting any lol. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 13:48:21
It would not be futile at all for you to start doing that.  
There is a misconception about pools.. many of the people in pools are people like you.  They speak their opinions by jumping pools if it disagrees with their morals. 
Now as for the largest miner.. bitmain.. they have a beast amount of hash and can try to swing things but that is where miners like you and I come into play.  Bitmain is a solid company for miners, so is Avalon.  I am using some usb's from SideHack. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:09:27
No it is completely random.  If you are really inteseted in bitcoin I HIGHLY recommend consensus algorithms by andreas antonupolous.

So the hashers are the "middlemen" that are paid to make the blockchain the most secure piece of code in the known universe that allows one send transactions without knowing the miners or receiving party..  This isn't progress some how..?  This is perhaps the largest moment in the history of man.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:00:40
Open the core wallet,
Settings(something like that) then click on console
walletpassphrase "your pass phrase"
dumpprivkey "public key you wish to get the private key for"
it will show a string of numbers this is your private key.
After that I am not sure but you can load it into an android wallet with that private key and there has to be some import feature in electrum. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:01:05
Segwit still makes no sense to me.. I see no real advantages vs making the blocks 4 times the size the data still needs to be stored.. in fact it seems to just make it more complicated for no reason other than making it more complicated..
