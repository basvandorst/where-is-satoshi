I don't see how you can send bitcoins without internet or something...
@_date: 2014-07-13 11:53:43
I don't get people who complain about having missed the boat on bitcoin. There are many penny stocks or sometimes even regular stocks that go up a lot more than bitcoin. So what? You can still trade it and profit from it.

Doesn't seem too bad, I am sure with their name they give an address they will accept with and that way customers can prove they bought merchandise and get BTC back when it is defective and the retailer is breaking merchant laws.

That's cool news. I used to buy a lot at Best Buy and after such benefit I am going to buy much more

Not a bad article, your page has a nice design too! Smiley But here's a tip, the title of this forum post made me think that you're just a newbie asking a question. I ended up clicking it but it wasn't what I expected. No problem with that but it'd be better if for example the title fas something like Article:Will bitcoin make me wealthy? What is money?
@_date: 2014-04-27 07:20:38
Well, not the easiest article to read. Really. 
But still, always thought they have some kind of strong financial control in Japan, don't 'em?

This sentence is wrong in so many ways.

i knew the image that the "litecoinguy" posted was Richard bransons island. but i just presumed he linked a random island image just for the sake of it.. 
where as the "bitcoin island party" never mentions any details such as:
how many hotel rooms that may be available, (they want a mass crowd, then its stupid to pick a small island with just 1 hotel with 50 rooms)
which week
which island
so i put "the litecoinguy" post aside, and was concentrating on the money grab campaign from coinapult. (the madhatter).
but from what i can see it is most definetly a money grab. cheeky beggers!
id rather a campaign be where they mention the lation and the dates (a specific week) and allow us to just use expedia and other bitcoin accepting travel sites to book the hotel/filight. rather than doing these crap centralized money grabs, just to make them richer.

Haha,as ridiculous as it sounds, I'm now not going to dismiss this as a possibility entirely. I remember a few years back when some conspiracy theorists told everyone that our electronic devices were being used to spy on us. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:23:27
 Nope, that's just stupid rumors.

What will he tell giving a speech now  in 2014?

I know only couple of sites that just take it. I'm surprised there is even BTC discounts!
@_date: 2014-04-21 06:22:55
today I saw a post of student on bitcointalk who makes the same research. he has already done a lot. you can join!

At some point, those coins will be spent/moved. But I don't think that will be for a long long time.
@_date: 2014-07-28 07:23:18
If you are interested in giving bitcoins to charity, I suggest donating to Amurtel.  This is a low overhead charity that spends its money helping people in need, unlike some high profile NGO's which spend money flying their executives around in helicopters and putting them up in $400 per night hotels.

Nice graph. It would be nice to compare prices to average salaries and see how those compare.

Imagine your best friend; someone you trust with your life asks you to show him/her all your emails, text messages, phone conversations and what you buy or sell. This person will then permanently record everything. Would you allow it?
Now imagine a faceless entity having access to all that information.
@_date: 2014-08-25 05:38:58
You should add Ira Miller (coinapult) to the list and also Stephanie Murphy.
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:11:54
Wow! You've done good! Nice to see physical coins !

In theory, a large whale could attempt to manipulate margin calls at exchanges like bitfinex. If, over time there is demand for all of a whales hypothetical, many thousand BTC, then the whale were to decide that they no longer want to lend out their BTC, they could stop lending causing people to be forced to close their positions as they would be unable to carry their position.

Do citizens in Argentina know about bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:37:39
Doesn't this fact mean that the future of Bitcoin would be really good as there are a lot of people who are willing to make a deal with bitcoin and the number of these people is increasing 
@_date: 2014-04-27 08:17:48
Sure, the whole structure should not rely only on good will of it's participants - effectiveness limits are reached very soon. But decentralization is a whole thing. The key one.
@_date: 2014-08-25 05:41:30
This is amazing, it just goes to show that bitcoin is being pushed out there and people will soon become more curious meaning more people will look into what these ATM's are for and wanting to know more about bitcoin. I can honestly say though that as of yet I have not seen a bitcoin ATM but I know in time the more they bring out I am likely to see one in the future.
@_date: 2014-08-25 05:41:09
Glad they have started accepting it as money, people were taking bitcoins in front of legal eyes and not being charged/taxed. Even if they steal no charges were put.

You: "Oh, sorry, I want to tip you guys. So. Here's the deal. I would ordinarily give each of you twenty bucks or so, but in this case I am going to give each of you the equivalent of twenty bucks each, but in an Internet currency called Bitcoin."
Movers: "Maybe you just give us fucking sandwiches and soda?"

Everyone laughed at them and called them nutjobs who should remove their tinfoil hats. They were actually correct and no one would have even know the extent that we were being spied on by our own government if we didn't have Snowden. So,yeah,who knows?
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:10:11
I still think that Bitcoin is decentralized even though  there are a lot of services and all of them work on our trust and if they would not meet our requirements we can make another one)) or you an do it by yourself 
@_date: 2014-08-25 05:39:23
I'd personally like to pay for my morning coffee with Bitcoin at times.
But I probably wouldn't do it all the time.
I would most likely use my Debit/Credit Card.

Another great quarterly report by CoinDesk!
Many things happened in Q2 of 2014

All the core developers who were with Bitcoin at the beginning are starting to leave, this could actually affect the price, especially if the Bitcoin foundation still has the ability to fuck with the network unless the community can create their own fork we all agree on.
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:23:51
Read about this idea in the other thread! Yeah, don't know either whether this idea has been brought up before, but it may be worth looking into! The people over at Dogecoin successfully did quite some marketing stunts, while Bitcoin sometimes appears to be rather greedy.
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:24:11
No charge back for merchants. But customers fear it is difficult to claim refund back when problems arise. They need time to accept the advantage rather than to focus on the drawback of BTC.

everything here can  be dismissed as trolling

I agree , it is great and it confirms theory that China is able to do amazing and huge things ! Can't stop surprising it 
@_date: 2014-07-28 07:21:19
This is bad in the short term for Bitcoin. Because Dell uses Coinbase(instead of accepting and keeping Bitcoin directly), coinbase will need to eventually sell the BTC to cover the USD they gave to Dell. This is why the price is dropping. Then people start to panic and sell as well.
@_date: 2014-07-28 07:23:25
If you have bitcoins that have appreciated and do not plan to take advantage of the tax laws, keep in mind that the authority of the IRS comes from the barrel of a gun.  Please remember that the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is "about seven years".

They didn't provide much evidence for this conspiracy theory did they.

Yes, no one will stop this trend. More people are holding and spending btc.

Thank you for this information. That's pretty nice to hear that there are well-established customer-oriented companies in the bitcoin kingdom.
