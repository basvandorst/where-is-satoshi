scrypt mining has been dominated by ASICs for years.

I've been mining since 2013 and all but one of my 7970s/280Xs from that period are still mining. The 1 card that did die was a result of a manufacturing defect and was replaced under warranty.
My newer 480/580s from last spring are also all still going strong and ROIed times over.

Some places (like bittrex) have been using BCC as the ticket for bitcoin cash since the hard fork.

Many if not most employers require you have a bank account to have your pay check direct deposited into.
There are also counties that have a legal limit on the amount of cash you can spend on a single transaction, any transaction over that limit is required to be either completed by check or digital.

newegg.ca stopped accepting bitcoin last spring without any notice, looks like they have now started accepting it again.

This was the first thing that popped in my mind after reading the headline.

Make sure that you move any BTC you have out of your blockchain wallet before doing anything involving your private key (definitely before you import it into any wallet).
