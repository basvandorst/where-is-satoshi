You have to include all income as part of gross income, regardless of whether there is a specific reporting requirement.

I doubt today's society would be able to function on such a voluntary tax system.

What exactly is voluntary taxation? Charity to the government?

You can also use specific identification as long as you document (at the time of the transaction), which BTC lot you are selling/exchanging.

It's no different than getting stock from your employer; it's taxed initially as regular income, and any later gain is taxed when it's sold. I guess you can complain that's unfair too, but realize the wealthy derive a large amount of their income from capital gains.

How about you complain to Congress instead. They write the laws, the IRS merely follows them.

Ignorance of the law is no excuse, legally speaking. You'll very likely face a stiffer sentence if it was intentional, however.

The $600 doesn't matter, you still have to report capital gains either way.

I've yet to figure out what part of the Internal Revenue Code the IRS is relying on for declaring solo-mining BTC as income. For pool mining it's clear that the pool is paying you for services rendered.

Our university computer science club once named a computer wang, and got away with it by claiming it was named after the the company.

You should direct your rage at Congress. The IRS are merely interpreting the Internal Revenue Code, which Congress is responsible for, exactly how everyone expected and thought they should.

There's a similar situation with wages. Your employer issues you a W-2 at the end of the year, listing your wages. A copy of that also goes to the IRS.

Pretty sure people aren't using electronics as value stores or currency, though.

Pick something reasonable and consistent.

Is Mt Gox down for anyone else?

By sentence I did not mean jail sentence necessarily.

Google "shamir secret sharing".

What does this have to do with the IRS?

Do they also accept BBQCoin?

multipool.us is another option that is transparent about what they mine.
