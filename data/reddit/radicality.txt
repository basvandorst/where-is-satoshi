I'm visiting Tokyo currently – any recommendations on places that accept BTC, mostly interested in delicious food! Also, how does a BTC ATM work? Do I transfer BTC to a specific address that the ATM tells me?

I've never heard of Wences before reading the great book 'Digital Gold' recently. I highly recommend it, it covers a lot of interesting bitcoin history that I hadn't known of. [Link](

Yeah, no one running this kind of scam is dumb enough to put anything remotely useful in the dns records, or choose a hosting company that would give a shit about scam sites.

I'm not sure I understand. I thought he had private key K with public key to send funds to f(K) which doesn't have the "bitcoin" prefix. Then the app simply prepends "bitcoin:" to specify the protocol, kind of like "mailto:" or a bunch of other ones. How can he retrieve the private key to the address ("bitcoin"+f(k))?

This particular code is in Julia language, you should check it out!

Yep exactly!

That's a vectorised greater than operator. Have you done any matlab or any other vector based programming, this is really popular there.

I guess that popularity is correlated with google searches, which is almost obvious.

Hmm, I would say the main reason nvidia is doing so well ($20 to $150 stock price in 3 years) is the recent uptick in popularity of machine learning and convolutional neural nets. A lot of the top tech companies are filling their data centers with nvdia gpus to run these computations.

I remember buying a raspberry pi couple months ago from some guy advertising on reddit, was around 0.5 BTC. So hard thinking thinking of all these past purchases with BTC seeing it rise in value so much now. But then again we need to keep spending them to get merchants to accept and use them :)

Isn't a luddite a person opposed to any computerisation / technological advancements ?

Damn it, I really wanted to order batch 1, but couldn't buy enough bitcoins in time for when the orders opened :(
