your POS app is only for CC correct or it can accept bitcoin as well?

I just want to make sure I understand you correctly, you want to have a bitcoin processor so you can accept bitcoin from your customers?

sorry about that.
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:15:08
that should not had happen.
I was wondering. does Coinbase have POS as well?

So basically just the appearance is the main advantage over bitcoin wallet... 
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:28:02
that's true but what is the advantage of Bitcoin payment processing company over bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:08:29
think of this, 
NO chargeback
NO merchant fees
Very low transaction fees
No PCI compliance
Less Hassle

Nice website, but may I suggest to put the bitcoin logo as well so your customers know that you are accept bitcoin.
With more customers using bitcoin it will increase your profit by means of No charge back, No merchants fee and No transaction fees.

Question, was the transaction done online or via POS?
It should not have taken that long, Our processor for payment with bitcoin (Payprogent) just take seconds. And of the bat merchant and customers can see this done.

That seems to take to much time and effort with bitcoin.
What's your website, if that's is ok. Because with PPG or payprogent with their POS you just dial the amount  and let the customer scan the QR code and it's done deal.
