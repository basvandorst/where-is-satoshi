I opened the image up and stared at it intensely, like a magic eye picture. After about 2 minutes of borderline rude staring I saw Roger Ver talking to his followers like he thought he was Jesus on the shores of Lake Galilee. Then I started to see actual shit spewing out of his mouth akin to a fiercely erupting volcano filled with steaming magma faeces which reminded me of that time Cartman shoved food up his ass and pooped from his mouth.
Did I win?

But how then does the company I just paid with Bitcoin know where to send my stuff? Or how does the pizza shop know it was me who ordered the pizza with bitcoin? Is there a way to separate the personal details from the transaction itself?
