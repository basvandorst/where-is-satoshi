Cool. Very clear explanation. Thank you for your time and patience!!

I thought I'd buy one Bitcoin at $3700 on Friday, so started a wire transfer from my bank. I thought it was a bit expensive, but if Bitcoin is going to the moon, it doesn't make that much of a difference in the long term.
Well, I guess the banks don't work weekends, so now that the price is at $4300 and the wire still hasn't gone through as of Monday morning, I guess buying a full Bitcoin isn't going to happen today.

Limiting your wire deposits to exchanges or just limiting your p2p transactions?

Oh, ok. I thought that the 2x part was begrudgingly agreed to in order to get segwit through. I didn't realize that people were hoping to get segwit, but not the 2x
The 2x is increasing block size to 2mb right? And people don't want that because it makes it harder for users to run a full node, thus making bitcoin more centralized?
Or was that just for the 8mb blocks and there's a different reason to not want 2x. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:26:26
Makes sense! 
So when all is said and done we'll have three coins: segwit, segwit2x, and big block. Right?
And the bitcoin reddit community is in general in favor of segwit (current bitcoin), right?
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:29:24
I wish I would have done that. I didn't want to pay the Coinbase fees, so I did a Wire Transfer to Gemeni. Looking back, I would have made up any cost of fees with the recent gains. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:12:26
So 2x is the new Bcash? I thought it was part of the segwit 2x. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:33:01
Same happened to me and I'm in the US. Price climbed from 3700 to 4300 waiting for a transfer.  
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:27:48
Lol. Shit like this is what makes this sub so hilarious.

Thank you for taking the time to post this to Reddit. I would have missed this interaction otherwise!
Saves me the time and helps me understand Bitcoin better. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:41:46
How does it immunize itself?
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:05:38
For me, I see the charge a few days (1-3) later. The money doesn’t show up to Coinbase until 6-7 days later. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:08:29
I thought blocksize increase was on the table in the future at some point. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:40:45
I like that name Hoaxtoshi..did he come up with that?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:58:13
Best explanation. Thanks.

There’s a lot of liars in these comments.  The think a lot of Bitcoin evangelists would move to alts for profit taking. 
When the price is up, r/bitcoin is full of memes. When  Bitcoin is down, it’s full of people saying “should I sell now and buy back later?”  
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:49:08
Ha. I think they’ll have to worry about Litecoin logo confusion!

Hypothetically, if they cared that much they would protect us instead of engaging in a battle. I’m not saying that’s the answer, but it’s an option, no? Or at least in this case S2X is a viable threat and should be addressed, unlike BTG

How do taxes work with bitcoin considering one may be always buying and spending?
With a stock, you can identify which shares you want to sell, like FIFO. 
But if I buy a bitcoin in 2015, then buy one in 2017, then buy a coffee next week after the price drops...
Would a pay a gains tax from the 2015 or take a loss from 2017? I don't think there are wallets that let you identify which coins you use, right?
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:34:14
I think in most of these situations the people that take hard stances in public privately keep a stash. This guy, Jamie Dimon, BCash people,... they say things like “bitcoin is dead” but it’s just to make a point. 
I’ll bet the guy in the article still has a few or few hundred BTC laying around. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:37:52
Why is it going to take years? I thought segwit was done wth already...
Do you have to move your bitcoins to a new address to make them segwit compatible?
Sorry, this thread confused me!
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:13:26
That's what I understood.  Now you're making me second guess myself. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:27:39
So let’s say they go to 2mb after 12 months. But S2X is going to 2mb next month. Would it be similar tech but with different developer?
Why are NYA guys so impatient to increase the block size now?
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:08:38
Haha. Will have to try "slow" confirmation next time. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:16:05
I’m not a professional lol
@_date: 2017-10-07 07:59:28
Ohhh. I thought it was next in the list!
@_date: 2018-07-10 01:48:37
Very cool. Wish they distributed in the US!
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:11:41
When your bro asked for the bit address how did he get it and then send it to you? Text? Some kind of shorthand? Just wondering how convenient a transactions like this would be. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:04:38
Ah yes. The QR code. Still learning. Thanks for the reply!

Probbly should have done it earlier. If you want to risk transaction time issues during 31 and aug 1 ten go for it. 
Advantage of pulling is you make get get free BCC. 
Disadvantage is risk and fear of transaction delays during chain split. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:25:53
Could you print out part of the blockchain as a paper trail of acquiring and selling the bitcoin? I don't know if you would be able to find specific transactions. 
Or provide some kind of screenshot of your wallet holdings with transaction dates?
@_date: 2018-12-13 04:20:43
Very cool!

Lol. I was going to head to Bad Burger tonight for some craft beer. Disappointing to hear they can’t afford a new iPad t accept my decentralized money!! Lol
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:55:43
I did not take your advice and went to Bad Burger. They do not take Bitcoin LOL! Worth the trip for craft beer in Thailand though. 
Trying Eat Me and Missing Burro tomorrow.

This is a huge economic opportunity. I mean to create a course or paid information resource that explains it. 
I'm just learning about bitcoin and the information on it is scattered and incomplete. There's super noob stuff like what a ledger is and what trustless means, and then it jumps to some complicated shit real fast. 
There's a giant gap of consolidated, step by step knowledge that's missing form the "how to learn bitcoin" arena.
Take your frustrations explaining bitcoin, figure out what's tripping people up, and then sell the course online. I'd pay for it. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:59:11
I've been reading a lot about segwit, bip148, etc. I'm relatively new to bitcoin but I pretty much understand what those things are, in very basic terms. 
What I don't understand is why miners are in conflict with users and developers. Are they individuals or groups? Can someone explain why there's an issue?
I thought segwit2x was a good compromise because it included segwit and the bigger blocks. I thought those opposing sides were the root of the conflict. But after reading a recent post here, it seems some folks are unhappy with that too. 
Just trying to figure out the ins and outs so I can know what my opinion is. Thanks guys!
