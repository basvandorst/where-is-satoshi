working on it. about to migrate to bigcartel- idk if they have an extension, but it doesn't matter because my designer is well on his way to being done.
@_date: 2012-07-28 14:14:35
Email me! jason and lmk what you want. I'll definitely take your BTC! 
What did you order last time? 
@_date: 2012-07-27 03:16:15
Still oils that get over the inside if the wrapper and get funky. Trust me, I've tried every way. 
@_date: 2012-08-16 14:22:06
lol pressure. shopify gets around to adding things basically when they want to. but they have NO PROBLEM spamming you with Tim Ferriss' bs.
@_date: 2012-07-30 02:53:36
I would love to, but atm my shopping cart (Shopify) doesn't have the option available, and I'm about to migrate to BigCartel. 
Any chance you could get one or both of them to offer the option to their customers? I can't tell you how much I'd love to have a BTC option on the site.
@_date: 2012-08-16 14:21:16
thanks! hit me up! 
@_date: 2012-07-26 23:46:55
looking into it now. i currently use shopify, so it might not be as easy as i'd hoped.

Awesome. Any chance I'll be able to reap the holiday BTC this year?

There you go. Been meaning to look into Ripple, but was worried they were like LTC.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:13:24
It's been in there a while, prior to the usd withdrawal problems they'd been having. Occasionally transferring out BTC has never been a problem before, and I had no reason to think it was going to be now! 
Lord knows I would never transfer anything INTO gox, but for trading it was great- all that volume.

They're not "bankrupt." As per their website they have been issued a check by their bank.

Also Belize is paradise. 
Wake me when I can buy a place on Caye Caulker in BTC.

@_date: 2013-04-28 05:56:20
Oh shit I hadn't noticed fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...
Wait no seriously it's no problem &amp; I was hoping the bottom would fall out. Bought high, sold high, hanging out in the exchanges.  The lower it goes, the more coins I end up with. That's the way this works, right?
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:19:58
Not for the amount of money that I have tied up. 
Though honestly, if there were a steady flow of communication? I'd be fine waiting for my money. But "the check is in the mail" - not even to *me*, understand, but to Roman and then, *somehow* to me - that's unacceptable. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:37:56
Brightly colored!
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:06:11
That's what I was thinking, but it's a pretty pervasive rumor, and LTC is rising in "value" as a result.
@_date: 2013-04-21 08:26:05
10k usd? I guess it's subjective...
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:51:25
Man, I wish you were in the States. I'm with Webgistix, and they're some of the worst people I've ever had to deal with.
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:39:57
I have $32004 tied up. Roman stopped responding to my emails the day after Bitfloor ceased trading. 
My lawyer was a bit confused about the situation, what with bitcoin being a new tech, but it's about time to follow up. 
I've tried posting to reddit about this but the predominant response has been that I should be patient and that Roman will come through.
I'm pretty messed up about this, however. To have that much money in the air has been hugely stressful, not just financially, but emotionally. I've never experienced such a lack of concern for a client base. 
And it's not like he died. He's happily tweeting about attending developer meetups.  He is, apparently, happily doing anything other than running his business.
I run a candy company- hardly a multimillion dollar international money exchange- and when I've had manufacturer or shipping problems I've been in constant contact with my customers, letting them know that their $20 purchase is important to me and discussing their options and letting them know that I'm not screwing them over. Keeping people in the dark isn't an option. How this situation is being handled the way it is is completely insane to me. I get that his bank put him in a bad place, however, it's his behavior that is keeping him there.
I, too, would like some advice on next steps. I don't want to get involved in a long, obnoxious lawsuit. It would be expensive and stressful and would definitely hurt public confidence in Bitcoin. However this sum of money is absolutely worth getting into one. 
Roman, please talk to us. It's ridiculous to act like you're not on r/bitcoin, and you could make a lot of people feel a lot less antsy with just a titch more transparency.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:30:35
Well, it was almost a 100% increase in BTC sales!
@_date: 2013-04-01 03:14:36
Depending on the price, I will buy that shit right now.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:40:15

@_date: 2013-11-25 02:21:24
I am! I think it's going to go up in value. Or do you think it will crash?
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:45:47
Wow! I didn't get to see any of that. All I saw was a chance to possibly trade lollipops for chips or something. Alien Blue only ever said I was banned. Assumed it was an r/pyongyang type sitch.
I have never not refunded a no show of candy before. I have had some screwups in my five years of business, but there has never been a situation where I have intentionally done wrong by anyone.
Thanks for pointing out the comments- I'm pming the author to send him a long overdue refund and some free lollipops.

Can anyone explain the point of litecoin? Other than little details, what's the actual point? Why invest? Does anyone accept them? It's already an uphill battle to get places to accept bitcoin- it feels silly to say, "hey, take this other virtual currency, too." 
I feel like litecoin is just piggybacking on bitcoin without offering anything truly new or useful.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:09:43
I'll give the same advice for .25!
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:42:38

Y'all can buy lollipops from me come Monday morning.
Hell- I'll have 'em available tomorrow- why not?
Plus I'll mention it in my newsletter next week. 10k subscribers is going to equal a lot of emails asking what the hell a Bitcoin is...
@_date: 2013-04-21 01:04:29
Honestly, me, too.
I imagine he's bugging out right now, and there's nothing more fun than a bank emergency just before a weekend.
While I appreciate his daily updates on Bitfloor, I think an AMA would make a lot of us rest easy. It certainly helped MtGox!
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:44:26
The only downside was that they had to get their newfound fiat back into bitcoin, which would take them a while.

Dude. again, I'm not "lawyering up for a lawsuit." I'm "covering my ass."

Either way, I'm in it for the long haul.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:10:07

@_date: 2013-04-25 21:19:57
How is it money laundering if I'm keeping records? My accountant says I'm fine, so I'm pretty sure I'm fine.
@_date: 2013-04-25 01:30:11

@_date: 2013-04-04 20:56:18
You're sweet to say that, but my website looks like it was built by monkeys using Angelfire in 1998.

@_date: 2013-05-05 03:21:59
He's not legally allowed to spend our money on a single thing, actually. None of us loaned or gifted him a cent- and besides, if he can't get our funds to return them to us then he can't get them to spend on legal action.
And it's not "obviously" anything. 
And harassing banks isn't helpful for anyone. At all. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:16:15
1. Keep records of your cash withdrawals as money you're investing with BTC. 
2. Pay taxes on money you're taking back in from BTC.
3. Profit!
(optional  don't be laundering money)
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:37:48
And also this. I hated seeing BTC double in value in the 48 hours after my cash became permanent fiat. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:26:40
Funny how it conflicts with the earlier update of "the bank mailed us a check."

This is gross.
@_date: 2013-07-23 02:59:33
Nice try, Roman!
Just kidding. I actually had his back at first. The bankz are sooper evil! But you know what? He has been awful. Zero returned emails, bullshit updates on the Bitfloor twitter &amp; homepage, just... just the worst customer communication since maybe BFL. Which is incredible since he had OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS OWED. 
I own a LOLLIPOP COMPANY and when there's warehouse issues that screw up a few hundo in orders I go into crisis mode. This guy had an actual money exchange company and he just cold didn't give a shit that he was tying up people's savings and futures. 
Also, if it weren't for AudenX et al actually pursuing him and his lawyer and turning them on to ICU, Roman would still be flitting around coffeeshops and riding his bike and not giving a shit. 
There's no point to getting his back. He's not BFL. It won't put you at the front of the line. :)
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:50:59
No shit.

@_date: 2013-05-01 18:57:45
Romans personal twitter: twitter.com/defunctzombie - it was quiet for a few days but he's started to use it more as the Bitfloor collapse fell out of the news.
As for the "hack," there wasn't one. According to Roman, his bank (I believe Chase Manhattan, so it's literally in the city he lives in) decided Bitfloor was a high risk account and closed it down with only a couple of hour's notice, leaving him only enough time to send out a few emails before removing his ability to send users their USD. 
One person I spoke to said that roman had mentioned that he'd actually already gotten the check for the balance from Chase and was trying to find a bank that would let him have an account so he could process the ACH orders. Which would be lovely to have verified, as it was only hearsay.
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:25:43
Great! Why? 
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:40:14
actual lol. THE TIPBOT IS CONFUSED.
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:06:30
Well, the earlier update said the bank sent him a check. Now the update is that he's waiting to hear about his remaining funds.
Also, not "your" funds. 
I stopped holding my breath.

@_date: 2013-11-27 13:02:57
Ces't (mostly) moi. Thanks!

Guy with tens of thousands locked up, here. Talking to a lawyer.
Not to sue, and not to go to war. I have a solid lawyer I've worked with for years, and I want to know what I should be doing in the event that, oh, I dunno- roman loses the check/can't keep track of the ach deposits that didn't go through/gets hit by a car while jaywalking and dies. To be fair- he handles mainly business law, and has already said that this is a weird area to be having legal issues; he doesn't specialize in virtual currency woes and doesn't know who would (and no, I'm not being charged for this as of yet, and he won't bill for anything unless he feels confident that he knows what he's talking about).
Roman has not really been all that communicative- his PR people clearly went to the MtGox school of bedside manner- as emails are going unread, both his bitfloor &amp; personal twitter feeds have gone quiet, and the Bitfloor info page makes it sound like the next time anyone will hear anything other than, literally "the check is in the mail," is roughly April 30th. There are any number of things he could do in the meantime to make everyone less nervous, from scanned letters and emails from the bank to an AMA to responding to emails in a timely manner. He was quick to be cocky towards MtGox during the crash- it would be rad if he could be just as vocal when his site went belly up. 
Better to lawyer up and sit tight then to do nothing and sit tight. I've never sued anyone before- I've never had to and I hope I never will. 
And also, for the record, Bitfloor was GREAT until it stopped. If Roman got it going again and had all his shit together, I would be happy to come back on board. 
After he gets me my goddamn money, though. Tomorrow I have to use Bitinstant like a noob to get back in the game. I'm pretty peeved about that. I've watched the market move in ways that would have doubled my money by now. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:16:16
They're selling a full $5 under MtGox, tho!
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:47:05
Dwolla takes 30 days to do ANYTHING.
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:50:11
I noticed the price drop, checked here to see what was up, and then went back to hanging out with my friends.
I maybe hoped the price would basement out so I could spend a shitload of fiat on BTC, but I knew it wouldn't really bottom out and I don't play margins.
Anyway, even though I didn't really have anything to do with it, I'm especially proud of the Bitcoin community today.
@_date: 2013-01-24 22:07:31
I'm neurotically day trading every couple cents. Honestly I should just play satoshi.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:42:21
Thanks. Really appreciate it. Been a customer for like three years because y'all kick so much ass.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:40:36
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:24:14
yup. looking like everyone: 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:57:14
Very carefully. Lots of testing!

Dammit I know! Haven't finished the copy for those...
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:25:25
No, I'm not giving up. I have 30k wrapped up.
I'm just done holding my breath.

Thanks so much for for helping me with this.

@_date: 2013-09-01 11:04:02
And lollipops! 
Unfortunately you have to email me directly as the shopping cart feature in shoplift doesn't quite handle Bitcoin. But soon!
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:11:29
But I want to buy 10 instant!
@_date: 2013-04-21 05:13:58
I'm sure he'd love to make you feel better!
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:52:26
Maybe. PM me your details anyway? It'd be cool, maybe to have someone local to talk to about this stuff so my gf can get a break.
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:08:38
no, we were sitting next to each other. i was able to watch the confirmations take place.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:07:25
Man. Come on over to Caye Caulker on the way! I'll buy you a Belikin. Not with BTC, but whatever.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:42:26
I trust him exactly as much as I trust anyone I've never met &amp; who are holding on to thousands of my dollars. Which is to say, I hope for the best but I expect the worst.
It's not a question of "if" I'm lawyering up, as I guarantee you he already has- its a question of finding out what my legal options actually are.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:07:56
I can vouch for it's usability! I set it up on my store (plug:  yesterday, and I've already had four transactions in BTC!
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:29:45
Right on. However, if it's a check on his desk, he really should tell us that. 
I'm over being angry that I missed out on investing my 32K into last night's rally (the reason I even noticed Bitfloor closing trading was that I was about to turn it into BTC- it would have *doubled*), and now I just want to know what is going on with my money. I'll be talking to lawyers as of Monday morning. Any reddit lawyers looking for a client?
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:31:02
Oh. Sorry. Just get the total + shipping - tax and email your cart to jason and ill take care of you! 
@_date: 2013-09-01 15:37:58
I would, but I'm two weeks from finished on a huge site redesign that cost me several thousand dollars.
Plus, minus the BTC thing, they're a really, really solid company.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:21:25
Exactly my targeted audience! :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:13:35
Tho no lie- the place is still a super fun San Pedro hangout. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:55:10
Really? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:36:08
We have some surprisingly savory flavors!
@_date: 2013-04-26 15:48:56
For the record, you can buy sriracha lollipops on my site, and I DO accept BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:07:36
That's true for bitcoin, as well, if I'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:46:57
He's apparently a customer of mine! 
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:56:58
Dude. Get out now.
You shouldn't invest more than you can comfortably lose in an instant, and honestly, most of us didn't even notice this "crash." You might not have the nerves for Bitcoin. No offense implied. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 05:01:31
I think you're taking the whole "bitcoin is the Wild West" thing waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too far.
Bitfloor going down was his bank's doing, not his. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:52:25
Also: AWESOME!
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:36:03
Hey! Thanks for taking the time!
I'd like to point out that all disruptive technologies (fire, the printing press, microscopes, automobiles, the internet, etc) are seen as terrifying and even unnatural to some people, who don't realize that once that technology is in the world, there is no turning back. Virtual currencies are here, have been here for a while, and will continue to be here whether or not the USA gives its blessing. 
It's also really fun watching the first global currency be born. We should be a positive part of the birthing process!
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:07:36
link, please, to any comments of anyone getting their USD back via ACH post Bitfloor's ceasing trading.
edit: grammar

@_date: 2013-04-19 05:53:45
Well, I had to deposit 35K into my fucking bank account so I missed out on doubling my money. 
I'm pretty pissed, actually.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:27:39
can't get to my wallet, either.
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:54:48
Like a week ago, even.
@_date: 2013-05-04 00:49:24
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2013-03-05 16:50:47
Sucks! Ill be running around nonstop on my karaoke chariot. Maybe ill paint the BTC logo on it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:14:08
I already own rescues. I bought TBG from a family of showdogs.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:36:41
You're totally right.
I'm just stunned that people would take the time to be publicly butthurt that someone else bought a dog vs getting a rescue (which I have done, they're sweethearts, mostly, if they haven't actually been traumatized prior to or during their stay at the shelter, either by shitty people or psychotic dogs). So i tried on a libertarian zinger &amp; it fell flat.
That said, she's actually a great puppy, y'all.
@_date: 2013-02-08 17:55:34
How is that editorializing? It's the one thing they said about bitcoin that wasn't a direct quote. Trust me- I want bitcoin to be embraced as much as you do.

It's not like anyone's going to use Bitfloor anymore anyway.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:40:08
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:46:03
Just email me: jason We do, I just don't know an easy way to calculate shipping to a whole bunch of countries. :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:40:48
Yes, sir!
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:41:58
They are. They've been in touch with me. I'm one of their first customers who's been on them to get a BTC payment gateway option.
As for bitmit, I don't really have time to do individual listings. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:33:14
95% certain you were one of the people I met :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:34:40
Girl, I bought those, too. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:42:03
Can't the family member on the other end just wait patiently for the 6 confirmations to go through on their bitfloor account or whatever &amp; then cash out? They're ALREADY waiting in line at the WU outlet. Now they can hang out in the internet cafe, instead!
@_date: 2013-05-05 03:33:38
From bitfloor / help / security:
"All USD funds are stored in US bank accounts backed by FDIC protections. User facing accounts are separate from business operating accounts."
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:47:48
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:53:13
Oh, they've stopped responding to emails 2-3 days ago. I'd be stunned if they're even opening their inbox at this point.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:01:39
I deposited/traded/withdrew just fine with Bitfloor several times today. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:22:24
No- they were all canceled, and the people owed funds are in limbo.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:06:44
Oh me too! And it was convenient turning 10k into BTC without wiring anything or waiting 3-5 business days or having to worry whether I'd be "considered high risk" or if the market would spazz out before my account was funded. 
Super convenient.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:37:23
Cashed out at 243, bought more than I sold at 82. Feel like god is high fiving me.
@_date: 2013-04-21 08:26:50

Will do! It'll be a sec.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:02:38
Thanks. I'm stunned that roman isn't replying to this thread. People are clearly angry and frightened and he could basically chill everyone out with a few minutes of discussion.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:44:32
All said poor schmuck has to do is phone mom and tell her to be in the internet cafe within an hour of him sending it &amp; she can transfer it into fiat and deposit in her account. That gets rid of the insecurity of waiting overnight through whatever volatility happens (reduces it to whatever volatility happens over 6 confirmations).
And man- had poor schmuck been doing this in the last few weeks before the pop, mom'd be rollin' in it.
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:49:15
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:29:26

@_date: 2013-11-26 22:52:29
Like I said above: 
No go. I'd have to disable PayPal. Hate on them all you want (I do), they're still a touchstone and a lot of my clientele want to use it. 
I'm not willing to disable a payment gateway to add a more obscure payment gateway.

@_date: 2013-05-05 08:09:49
Oh. Dude. Sarcasm.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:15:57
I cashed out 20k through bitfloor the other day. Totally painless (and yes I'm still very much invested in BTC).
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:12:06
Also sadly, I'd have decent health care.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:01:25

Looking into this ASAP.
@_date: 2013-07-22 22:24:10
I only hope that no one ever engages him in a business setting ever again. 
Although they TOTALLY will. From the looks of his twitter he's got TONS of friends who somehow aren't embarrassed to nerd-buddy with him in a public forum. /justice
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:38:58
The fact that Roman is happily tweeting away about his hangouts while not updating his Bitfloor customers or answering their emails makes me crazy.
@_date: 2013-05-11 19:03:01
No. Roman is happily programming along- you can see his mundane day to day bullshit on his personal twitter- and he really doesn't seem to give a shit one way or another. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:17:04
Yup! Lifetime dog owner. My lab mutt shelter adoption needed a sister. I splurged. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:19:34
I contacted people on LB &amp; gave them my phone number. We texted back &amp; forth, agreed on meeting places, &amp; met!
We agreed on a spot price (5% over MtGox most recent sale), did the math, and they transferred BTC to my account &amp; I paid them cash. Stuck around and chatted for a confirmation or two. Shook hands and even made possible plans to hang out in the future. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:28:08
Two squirrels. Stop overvaluing.

Man. I hope you're right. 2 confirms to my Bitfloor account, none still to the 2 unknown addresses. 
Blockchain final balance reads that it's gone. I've never seen anything like this before &amp; I'm freaking out.

I always assumed those were essentially real life exchanges?
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:40:58
IANAL, either, but I do have a solid accountant, and she's calling it a capital gains tax, too.

@_date: 2013-04-22 15:06:29
Honestly, as a more seasoned Bitcoin user, I'm in the same boat.
Localbitcoin is useless. 
Bitinstant's keeps telling me that I am trying to go over my daily limit no matter what amount I put in (1K, 950, 900, 875... then I gave up)- BI was my go to back when I started last summer.
Coinbase's several days of transfer and constant complaints on Reddit make me wary. Same with a MtGox transfer.
Since my 32K is tied up in the Bitfloor fiasco (slash gone), I'm struggling to get 10-20K USD into BTC. There really doesn't seem to be any real way for me to do this. I've gone from smug Bitcoin zealot to once again really understanding the difficulty people have getting on board. 
Hand to the sky I will never be self righteous to newbies again.

If you figure out what you want &amp; the cost of shipping, email me at jason &amp; I take BTC!

Oh man. Search bitfloor on reddit. You've got AT LEAST two weeks, and then throw some prayer up on it.

Are you, like, hipster escrow? Is that a thing yet? I will hire you immediately if you are.
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:21:58
Thanks. I hope so, too!
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:30:35
Yes, but this shouldn't be conjecture on the parts of the people effected. Roman needs to be talking. A lot.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:33:17
Sorry. What I meant to say was IS IT TOO LATE TO INVEST
@_date: 2013-04-30 03:09:46
I have never seen anything take ten business days to get shipped domestic USA =&gt; domestic USA. Also both bitfloor and their bank are located in NYC, meaning a crazy short ship time.
And the lack of communication in the meantime is reprehensible, especially to those of us with tens of thousands locked up.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:39:38
i know right.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:54:13
Literally the same boat as you. Waiting on my 32k to come home to me. Radio silence from bitfloor. 
Would seriously love an update. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:48:48
No, he said "around ten days," which isn't actually a number. "Business days" wasn't even implied. 
The entire post is vaguely worded.
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:46:39
I absolutely will!
(edit: thank you!)
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:54:37
Would've been lovely to get a link from it- there's nothing more worthless than link less coverage in a magazine.
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:10:38
No kidding. I try harder than he does to reassure my customers when there's a fuckup on my end and I run a goddamn lollipop company- people never have more than like $20 tied up.
What's sad is that I loved Bitfloor, and would be patiently waiting not just for my money back but to use his services again, except that he's doing such a crap job of communication. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:57:41
You'd think international drug dealing websites would be all over this.
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:52:42
well... 
@_date: 2013-05-05 03:48:46
It would be rad if he kept us in the loop a little.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:21:51
Yes, I thought it would be faster if I emailed Reddit, instead.
@_date: 2013-02-08 14:04:51
But here's hoping we get a bunch of new users anyway!
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:00:26
And you help pay my rent! It's a fair trade. I'm serious about being your beta tester. Keep me in mind!

Yup! Love the volatility.
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:52:56
Thanks! 
And FWIW by and large these people are, and you sound like a classist asshole.
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:09:25
faith in humanity, in public- at a bank!
but with both parties from here on out i'm happy to just have them come over to my place or something.

I'm only now getting into BTCTC. 
Why am I not seeing Labcoin on their page? I see that I won't be able to bid until 8pm, but I'd like in on that floor (possibly).
Also I'm a reasonably intelligent guy, and BTCTC is not the most intuitively designed website. I'm RingTFM &amp; the FAQ and I'm still not quite getting how to buy stock in things.

Bitfloor sent me a crazy fast response to my email regarding this- +1 for customer service- and they told me to ignore outbound transactions from my deposit address &amp; that everything is fine.
Thanks everyone. Was reaching for the benzos.
@_date: 2013-07-31 23:41:21
Yeah? For how long? It's clearly not a long-haul thing (am I reading this correctly?).
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:55:50
Should I delete the client before restarting it?
@_date: 2013-02-28 20:44:50
I try to do what I do with any investment, that is, completely forget about it unless something comes up (either a news article or a catchup phone call from my financial advisor or I need fresh bathroom reading).
Seriously, Bitcoin is one of the most interesting things I've ever come across, I have a lot of money where my mouth is, and while I occasionally buy things with BTC (just to do my part in keeping the economy going), I more plan on sending my hypothetical kids to college with it.
What I'd really like to see is people stopping geeking out every "emotional" price point or whatever, and selling and then immediately feeling silly for selling. If you lose some money when it drops from, say, 34 to 31, this is SERIOUSLY not a problem. Historically, if you just wait a week or so it'll trot right past the high number. And even if it drops waaaaaaaaaaaay down to $2 (it won't, it's currently backed by heroin &amp; gambling - *cue Bender.jpg*), it will ultimately come back up.
If you're investing money you can't afford to lose in the immediate short term, you should go for mutual funds. If you're willing to believe in the future and stay cool, then this isn't gambling- this is realizing that the future is happening all around us, and that the future needs futuristic money and that the current system is broken and anachronistic. Bitcoin is elegant, and more importantly, it's *working.*
Buy in. Stay in. If you need to check MtGox on an hourly basis and shifts up or down cause you actual, type-in-all-caps anxiety, maybe you should consider a different investment strategy.

I'm like three weeks away. Sigh.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:37:40
We do!
@_date: 2013-04-27 06:55:48
No. I ended up transferring the wallet.dat file to blockchain.info and reinstalling bitcoinqt.
@_date: 2013-02-08 20:00:09
Thanks! First time I've gotten one of those!
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:07:55
Oh, well. Had a shot of Jager there anyway, so no harm, no foul.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:43:55
They need to offer an option of taking BTC that doesn't involve no longer taking credit card orders. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:26:29
You guys, man. I did really well at that last crash, and I plan on doing really well again. 
I'm buying in right now because Bitfloor made me withdraw money in fiat, leaving me BTC broke &amp; unable to participate in speculation &amp; the fun times.
Without having BTC in my wallet then the repetitive memes and bitterness of this reddit just seems so... empty.
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:01:49
Yeah been trying. Either they want literally 35% over or they want sketchy out of escrow western union or they don't respond.
It's crap.
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:07:38
Rough test bed, dude.
Like, I would lose tons of customers to this. I was excited to be able to get BTC as a side stream, but it's a long time before I could count on BTC from lollipops as the thing that pays my bills.
How long until I can actually use BTC at checkout? Like in conjunction with credit cards?
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:11:02
and are we worried about my USD funds in MtGox if I trade BTC to USD but don't try to withdraw the USD?
@_date: 2013-07-06 23:07:25
This is such good news. I'm sort of rich!
But everyone please remember that Roman is an insufferable asshole and you should never, ever do business with him again.
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:35:25
 My pleasure! I literally emailed them about this last week. I'm jazzed!
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:56:58
It would have changed the thrust of the question tho! :)
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:26:13
I'm willing to pay the premium! But no one responds to my messaging their ads. 
Where are you located? I'm in Austin. I assume the options in, say, the Bay Area are way better.
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:09:13
Especially ignore the ones pretending to be apologetic or informative. OMJesus you're a rookie.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:07:06
Whatever I want. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:54:51
That's funny- I stopped by Pedro's Inn on San Pedro a couple days ago since they were (I think) the first hotel to accept it- I was disappointed when dude behind the counter said they didn't take them anymore. Total bummer! I was so excited to brag.
@_date: 2013-04-22 22:04:30
And the process takes how long, again?
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:21:29
I mean. I'm a confectioner. I could make a paypal logo lollipop? But who would want that?
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:55:40
Oh interesting.
@_date: 2013-07-29 19:38:29
It went through, btw. odd delay. Guess I'll wait until the Goxxxter is liquid to mess with them again.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:58:21
Captain Picard is my fave captain. Why wouldn't I want that association?
@_date: 2013-09-05 04:36:37
What is a Bitcoin sister subreddit?
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:31:55
You're experiencing a lag of about a week right now. I wouldn't trade if I were you.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:44:39
Does it still report sales to shipping company?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:59:05
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:05:32
YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING STEP ONE CORRECTLY
@_date: 2013-11-30 11:32:46
My bad- I've been recovering from thanksgiving. 
Use BITCOINBLACKFRIDAY. I'm going to leave the sale up until at least through Monday!
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:14:08
So the conversation with MagicalTux is BS? Is MagicalTux even affiliated with MtGox?
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:24:56
Yes, and my Bitfloor account is no longer saying that the money is held. And Roman is staying silent on where the money actually *is.*
It has to be *somewhere,* right?
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:27:34
They've been across the board great for me.
@_date: 2013-03-23 22:57:52
Yeah! Now all we have to do is kick r/ass!
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:41:27
Yes they should. They're also hurting the future of bitcoin by being scroogy about hiring actual developers.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:10:24
You absolutely are!
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:18:46
Hells yes. May your stockings be spicy &amp; bacony, my friend.
