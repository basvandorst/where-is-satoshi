So even then its what? 13 weeks of pay.
Whoopdee do
@_date: 2019-03-26 05:42:16
at this point, 1 BTC isn't even impressive lol.
3,900 bucks is like 1 month's salary in the developed world. 
less than a used toyota. I mean, in some African or South Asian countries, maybe it's a lot but....not anymore

You think these whales are not hedging? 
man , people saying this are so gullible.
"but muh laws!" "it's illegal!"
Big whales are clearly shorting BTC with leverage, then dumping large amounts on exchanges or OTC.
It's easy to do. Next dump is 6/29 CME dump
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:41:35
can afford the cigs
@_date: 2018-06-12 06:52:21
CME is the real player in the game
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:52:29
Ya. It's a falling empire on its last legs.
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:49:00
I think it will happen, but it might take LONGER than 1.5 years.
why? 3 factors.
1. Koreans are being shut out.  (it was 25-50&amp; of the global market last year by some calculations)
Korean government regulations have scared off most Korean investors.
Crypto was huge in Korea last year. Now? The government has made it so frustrating that most people have simply given up using the exchanges. First of all, foreigners are now COMPLETELY banned. Secondly, there are ridiculously low deposit amounts for Koreans. It's like 300 dollars per month or week, something like that. And that's IF you sign up at a specific bank, with a "crypto account" and then get a document from your job to prove that you're employed, and send that in scanned and signed. 90&amp; of Korean crypto investors went to binance or simply pulled all their funds out. Students, freelancers, housewives, etc....are totally unable to invest at this point.
source: I live in Seoul.
2. Chinese have still banned ICOs and Exchanges. Yes, there are ways around this. Huobi and OkEx, and basing your ICO in singapore or Hong Kong. But it's a dangerous game. Until China re-opens it's doors, so to speak, all of these Chinese projects are up in the air. The retail money from china is huge. Maybe it comes back, maybe it doesn't.
3. Banks banning credit cards. Yes, we shouldnt borrow to buy BTC. But how many millions of people did just that in the past? now you can't . half of American's don't have access to $1000 in liquid cash, so......
I think 100k will happen, but it might be more like 2023 or so. It will need to be a massive change. Like an ETF or national governments adopting crypto
More time to accumulate!

I would just buy 100 1 oz gold bars with it at apmex.com or jmbullion.com.
But everytime i post that option ppl downvote it so hey......idk
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:06:25
Yes, probably
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:44:54
It's just like STEM fields. 
Nothing stopping women from picking those majors. Literally nothing.
They just dont have any interest.
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:43:56
Well crypto is 95+% male.
So....every female in every family is low IQ??? Thats what youre saying?
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:45:31
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:33:25
They are not dumb. As you can deduce logically.
They are just largely uninterested.
So the men will get wealth again.
It is what it is.
We cant force women if they are uninterested right?:))-
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:42:31
Yes. You are actually.
Many studies have shown that cryptocurrency is 95-99% male.
So yes, you are in the 1-5%.
But i think thats cool. Good on you
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:47:20
We need more women in the marines!! We need more women in plumbing!! Oh ....wait
@_date: 2018-03-05 10:15:14
.1 btc no doubt!
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:48:08
They are mostly not interested.
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:35:47
Yea but the math of your statement doesnt add up if 95% of women are not in crypto.
That means 95% of families are dumb?
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:22:16
Most people honestly think its a physical coin
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:31:18
Hahaha ok. 
Look i want more women in crypto too.
Sad truth is that they are not interested.
Weve had this same problem with STEM careers for decades.
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:49:58
Its just my experience with  sisters, wife, etc.....ive not found one female who's  remotely  interested in new technologies. It is what it is
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:56:50
Honestly, 99.9% are not interested.
Most peoples wives/gfs think its like some beanie baby/pokemon go type of fad. Not to.be a dick, but the VAST majority of women have no interest. They love the system as it is. If you start talking about libertarianism or inflation or the federal reserve, you best believe they will tune you out mang
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:00:57
Most people honestly see it as beanie babies or pogs or something.
Unless you studied ECON or CS. those ppl seem to be a bit more aware. But, even then
.......it takes a person willing to think outside the government controlled fiat system. That is really, really rare. Most people don't even question it.
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:45:28
Could be a hardware wallet. Or a seed?
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:42:48
Good time? Yes.
But scale in. For example, buy 200 bucks here, a few hundred next month, etc.... If it goes up, great! If it goes down, you can buy lower
@_date: 2018-12-04 01:11:57
There is no such thing as a physical bitcoin bro.
Its most likely a chocolate or some shit then
