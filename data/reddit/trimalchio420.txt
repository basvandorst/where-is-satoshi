The groups of moneyed interests that corporations represent won't disappear or stop being evil all of a sudden, they will fucking arm themselves. *That* is how they will exploit us: the old fashioned way, with guns.

I agree that new technology allows for more decentralization and less government, and that's fucking great! Remember I *am* a Bitcoin enthusiast ;)
I'd be 100000% open to similar innovations that can replace centralized authority's role in our society fairly and effectively. I just don't think we will be replacing it completely in any foreseeable future.
Of course, I also think we need more regulation and government intervention in some areas.
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:21:12
Well I think the burden is on libertarians in general. If I'm defending the status quo and they are against it and want to sway me, they need to offer an alternative. The NAP, etc. makes it quite clear that they want the old system to go and why, but it's always seemed to me that they have no reasonable alternative solution to things like law enforcement, public infrastructure, etc. The only answer I've ever gotten is essentially "free market", a solution I find vastly inferior to our current situation.

Typical libertarian with the political understanding of a kindergartner right here.
So replacing the system is too violent, and changing it is just "putting up with a variation of the status quo". Sorry, what is this mystical third option that I'm missing? The one that allows me to

1+2) Unfortunately groups that are willing to engage in coercion/aggression are the ones that tend to win conflicts so your peaceful group likely will not last long.
And what about people who live in the protected area, but don't want to contribute? If you don't make them, most people won't. If you force them to, congratulations, you just invented tax.
Not to mention when the defense groups get large they require more and more administration. Government.
3) You must first describe how we could even *transition* to a non-aggression based society. I maintain that it is *completely* impossible. The second you tear down passively "violent" state barriers to active violence, that is exactly what will spring up.

and that may be true of some regulation but much of it is clearly beneficial and needed - FDA food standards, for example. Without those what is to stop greedy capitalists from using dangerous pesticides, etc? Many additives could take years to start causing noticeable effects (cancer), so you cant really count on the market stopping them in time. 
Similar argument to.be made for environmental regulations, without them there is 0 incentive for these assholes not to pollute recklessly.

No, I'm not. It has nothing to do with your solution not being perfect, I'm saying our *current solution is better*. That is not the same thing, and it's obviously where we differ.
I believe all things end in violent upheaval, period. Human society can be no different.
I'm all for trying to get as much violence out of our society as we can but I believe you approach it from the wrong angle. I believe it cannot be fundamentally removed, but we can work to minimize it. That minimization requires systems, administration, centralized authority.
@_date: 2014-10-16 14:53:36
Non-aggression and non-violence are impossibilities. It's one thing to strive for a world without them (all for it!) and it's another to structure society based on the belief that they do not exist.

Power they shouldn't have had in the first place.


This is a gross oversimplification. Supporting the decentralization of one type of power is not the same as supporting the decentralization of all power (or the reverse, for that matter).
This is my beef with many libertarians, it doesn't have to be all or nothing. Most things in life are not black and white.
@_date: 2014-10-17 03:28:28


So what's your response to my last sentence then? What makes you think the elites will behave better, not worse, if we repeal all regulations and checks on their power? Considering the despicable shit they manage to do even with tons of regulation.

You whined about me not "being civil" in a completely different thread, didn't realize you were the same person I had made that other comment to, which is the only reason I responded the way I did. Normally I expect insults in arguments like these and just let them slide if combined with actual points. You will never catch me crying for "respect" for foolish ideas. Mine can stand on their own merit.
Furthermore, I went and checked, here was your first comment to me:




That's not a very respectful way to jump into someone's serious discussion, now is it.
Regardless, I stand by my statement. The vast majority of libertarians have the political literacy of a five year-old.


Only in your mind. All *you've* done is attack my character. But when your beliefs are indefensible I guess that's all you can do, right?
@_date: 2014-10-17 03:49:43
The elites we are talking about arent some monolithic group. They absolutely do buy legislation whenever they can,  however they are competing amongst each other as well which you can plainly see in the various "interest groups" etc.
And thats bad enough. But if the government monopoly on violence wasnt there, it would be *open fucking warfare* between these groups (and on everyone else). I just dont see how you can dispute that but id love to hear you try. Look at somalia, theres your free market utopia.
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:28:08


Well, to an extent it's hyperbole to make a point... however, most libertarians I speak to are not well read on these topics and seem to believe that violence will largely disappear in absence of the state.
Now, more serious libertarian scholars obviously doesn't take that position but they have universally failed to come up with anything approaching an acceptable solution. Given the nature of men and how we form societies and interact with each other I find it pretty unlikely they ever will.


Hahaha, wow. "Here's an insult. By the way, you should be more civil". Since *you've* decided the drop the pretense at civility, I have to say this is just the kind contradictory nonsense that I expect from a libertarian. Completely lacking in self-awareness.
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:36:30
1) I understand it quite well, I'm very familiar with libertarian philosophy. But back here in the real world, the fact is that *you* cannot defend yourself against all possible threats effectively (let alone attempting to do so and still live a quality life). The only conceivable way to do that is with a group of like-minded people... government.
2) It's not a question of moral equivalence at all, you misunderstand me. I'm saying groups like ISIS will spring up every time in the absence of government. If it's confusing the issue for you, forget ISIS. You will get violent warlords running shit if you don't have government.
3) It's a less worthy solution because the end result is less desirable. You really should read that wikipedia page closer. The only one here comparing things to unrealistic, idealized alternatives is you.
It's not surprising that you find it tiresome and frustrating trying to preach your little joke of a political theory. Maybe go out and experience the world a bit  before trying to form opinions on such difficult topics, let alone debate them.
@_date: 2014-10-16 17:39:02
1) Those countries are only able maintain their neutrality (and safety) because they are tolerated by the large, violent superpowers which run the world.
3) You are the one proposing a radical change in society, if you can't describe how it might be achieved then you don't need to be taken seriously. I would be impressed if you could describe it with only a thousand errors.

@_date: 2014-10-16 15:51:05
1) Hahahahahaha you have got to be kidding! First of all, that's *still answering violence with violence*. And, you know, centralized power. Secondly, I guess we are just condemning all the poor to death, but I'm talking to a libertarian so I'll let that one go I suppose. Finally, and most germane, what it would result in almost immediately is open warfare between groups of varying size, until power inevitably consolidates when one group emerges the victor, just like it has throughout all of human history. Or did you have some magic solution that would make things different this time around? Sadly the answer isn't "bitcoin".
2) Lot of words here without really saying anything. Whatever you want to call it, people who act in ways which are unacceptable to society (violent ones, basically) will need to be prevented from doing so. If you want to make the argument that violent men in prison are having their natural rights violated... ok, I guess? Whatever you want to call it, it's fair and necessary.


I despise violence as I've said. I believe that government ultimately prevents more violence than it creates. Somalia has essentially no government, security or regulation - a libertarian paradise! I guess the horrendous violence there is just a coincidence, right?
It's hilarious how you libertarians can't speak without extreme hyperbole and outright, willful misinterpretation. I suppose it's the only way to maintain such a simplistic worldview.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:27:09
Hardly. The whole thing is transparently self-serving. People are donating because they want Bitcoin and its community to look good, not out of concern for an old man we know next to nothing about.
What we do know is he wants to be left alone! Fundraising only serves to further force him into the spotlight.
It doesn't even make any sense. We are raising money for what exactly? Medical or legal bills which he may or may not have? As compensation for the invasion of his privacy, which the fundraising campaign itself violates?
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:34:12
I think it's debatable that we would ever be able to take it to the next level even without consistent interference and coercion, but for the sake of argument let's say it was. How could we ever get there? As things stand now, if you remove interference from the marketplace all you do is further empower the elite tyrants who are currently running things. It's a chicken and the egg problem.
@_date: 2014-10-17 05:44:06
* It wants to replace everything with "free market" solutions, which I am convinced would have disastrous results. I am *not* a believer in the free market as some ultimate good.
* It provides no real controls to protect against tyranny. (see above)
* It generally expects "charity" and the "local community" to provide any and all social welfare services
* Many public services would operate very poorly if run on a voluntary, piecemeal basis. Competing plumbing networks? Roads? Police? Fire departments?
* It wants to remove all kinds of regulations I consider vital to modern society. Regulations against pollution, food safety, etc. It fails to address just how integral to modern society regulations are. For example, how will the market avoid or punish bad actors if they can just lie about who they are! With no regulations corporations are free to deceive, manipulate and exploit you to an extent that's unimaginable today.
* It wants to remove the state monopoly on violence and send us back into the dark ages.

Lol so? Under your system they can just walk into a bank and take whatever they want. Socialized costs, LMFAO. Those are the table scraps they are forced to work with because our society has *some* laws which are still upheld and prevent them from just seizing everything like the kings of old. Repeal our entire system of governance and the people who *already have lots of wealth and power* will use that to grind the rest of us under their heel. They don't need any taxes for that, they never have.
@_date: 2014-10-16 17:44:10
Since you keep insisting, I just skimmed over [the wikipedia page]( which confirmed that yes I'm very familiar with the concept.
However, the non-aggression principle is just that, a *principle*. A moral stance. I'm asking for actual, real-world *solutions*. I get that you consider violence of any kind to be inherently wrong and government illegitimate, but what will provide its many vital functions if you are allowed to tear it down? And neither of you have attempted to answer that question beyond "private security" (or for that matter, the obvious, immediate problem with private security: what happens to those who can't afford it)
@_date: 2014-10-16 12:36:29
What a terrible article. Im a huge believer in bitcoin, but I couldnt care less for all this libertarian nonsense.
The biggest thing holding bitcoin back is its community. That this kind of foolishness can get such a positive response here is telling indeed.

Lol this is cute. It's a dichotomy but there is nothing false about it. Simply calling something false isn't an argument, either; it's the mark of someone who has no substance to back up their arguments.
I've defended my positions, but you haven't addressed my reasoning at all. Easier to feel smug if you can just dismiss it out of hand rather than debate the content, yes?


In the sense that I know what I'm talking about rather than just slinging insults, I suppose I have.
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:11:26


There is a very good reason. When someone comes up with a way to respond to and/or prevent violence without violence, I'll be all for it. Until then if you remove the passive "violence" of our systems of governance, you will just get the active violence of big fucking men with guns *really* taking your shit and *really* telling you how to live. I'll take our government and it's comparatively minimal interference with my life over ISIS any day, thanks.
Now don't get me wrong, I fucking despise our government and would change nearly everything about it given the opportunity. But it's vastly preferable to no government.

Change would definitely need to happen at the macro level first, and that is what I'm truly skeptical of. Individual people can just be so downright *evil*, and groups of them unchecked moreso... I just can't see it happening. It would need to be a real evolution of consciousness.
I agree with everything you said up until you start talking about the defense force. I started typing my objections, but they are all micro just like you said. I would love to see a day where mankind overcomes its pettiness and is capable of the kind of utopia you describe. I just don't think those needed macro changes are happening any time soon. In the mean time, there is a *lot* of good that can be done by working within the system. And without making improvements to correct our trajectory we will *certainly* never reach that point.
That's my opinion anyway.
@_date: 2014-10-16 17:31:06


I never said that it did. I'm saying that in reality it is not practical for individuals to defend themselves, you need government for that. You and libertarian thinkers offer private security, militias, etc. as a solution, which I contend will create *far* more violence.


What is, specifically? Talking in generalities like you are doing is just a tactic to avoid discussing anything of substance. If that's all you are going to do I guess I will just stop responding. That's a shame because I relish the opportunity to discuss these issues with people, but maybe you aren't up to it.


Well, you said you want to replace the government with private security. What happens to people who can't afford it?


I've laid out my arguments clearly and rebutted the few weak points you attempted to make.


*I* seem confused? Okay.


Not hypocritical at all if the current paradigm prevents greater violence. That's not to say the current paradigm couldn't be improved.
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:19:03


Because a system that can effectively protect the weak from the strong without violence has never existed, and likely never will.
Nice way to avoid having to justify your dogma, though. You should learn from my example, I'm sitting in this thread responding to a number of people who have nothing but "fallacious and previously-debunked arguments" to offer in the hopes of fostering dialog. Talking to one right now ;)


They are like night and day in that one has actually happened and the other has never and will never. Until you can describe how a peaceful transition to this libertarian non-violent utopia could take place and be maintained, a scenario like Somalia is the only conceivable end result of libertarian policy.


You haven't. None.

Of course not, don't be obtuse. In our current system taxation is one of the only acceptable forms of control, of course they take advantage of it. But it's not really *necessary* for them to dominate, just how it's done in our current system. With no legal protections of any kind all the metaphors you libertarians love to use for taxation will become realities - you will literally have people coming to your house with guns to take your money. "Taxation" will be a non-issue, then.
It's amusing that you are unable to respond with any kind of substance. All you've done is cherry pick my detailed responses to find minor quibbles. But thats really not surprising when the extent of your thinking on the matter is GUBBERMINT BAD
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:49:54


Totally in favor of that. Sounds more like communism than libertarianism though.


So nationalize the existing corporations, then demolish market controls? Without controls they wouldn't stay nationalized, some bullies will grab power. It all goes back to that paradigm shift in humanity that we both agree is necessary and I just don't see happening. I think we should consider how we can encourage non-violence within the current system while attempting to decentralize what power we can (bitcoin) and destabilize over-entrenched power (voting, activism, etc). That's basically my position.
@_date: 2014-10-17 01:41:46
No, they really cannot. The libertarian wet dream of privatizing all civil services has got to be the worst plan I've ever heard. You will allow the powerful elite to exploit the rest of us even more than they do now. I have no interest in going back to the dark ages, before we developed democratic systems of government that offer at least a little protection from tyrants. Because that is what you will get in your fantasy world, warlords carving the land into their own little fiefdoms.
 Large corporations commit far more crimes against humanity than almost any government has ever managed and yet you want to give them even more power.
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:17:08

A bitcoin can't exist anywhere else, period. You wouldn't be able to spend it, noone would recognize it as a bitcoin, it wouldn't *be* a bitcoin if it wasn't on the blockchain.
Furthermore, the manner in which new coins are created is tightly controlled and highly predictable. That's kind of the whole point - if just anyone could create bitcoins out of thin air whenever they wanted they wouldn't be very useful as a currency.
You might find this educational:
Now of course an exchange can claim to have more coins than they actually do (fractional reserve banking) but that doesn't make the original two statements I was replying to any less untrue.

Yes of course it does... but that's completely irrelevant here. There is no such thing as a "bitcoin not on the blockchain" and there most certainly are not "more coins in existence than the total number mined".
I encourage you to read up on bitcoin technology and you will see how those statements make no sense.

This is technically impossible. You are spreading misinformation.
@_date: 2012-09-10 02:17:52
The number of scammers involved in Bitcoin is hardly surprising but the rampant gullibility continues to amaze.

You are comparing software development managed with a traditional hierarchical, top-down company structure to an open-source project. It's not really the same thing and most of your points dont apply.


Are there non-technical managers that are involved in bitcoin protocol github?


Pretty sure the only "hiring" going on for the github repo is programmers approving other programmers' pull requests.

Just chiming in to say you absolutely *dont* understand statistics, or at least not how they are applied here. You might want to check out the wikipedia page on expected value.
And maybe stay away from poker, lol
@_date: 2015-04-28 06:43:53


*NO*. That's what you are missing. It's no more clever than playing roulette. Since you are taking a small fee out of each drawing they will inevitably lose money.
@_date: 2015-04-28 06:36:24


LMFAO. I mean it's barely even statistics, it's freaking math dude. It's hilarious how difficult this is for you to understand.


*It doesn't matter*. They have the same chance of winning *per paid entry* as someone betting only once - the same *expected value* - which makes it fair. It doesn't become less fair when they buy another ticket, or ten, or a thousand. As their chance of winning goes up their potential profit goes down.
Those "smart" guys placing 99% of the bets in your lottery at the last minute will lose 1% of the time, negating all the profits they make in the other 99% drawings.


Because I understand mathematics and you clearly do not, lol.
@_date: 2015-04-28 06:53:59


This sentence doesn't make any sense. Unless you are giving out tickets for free then it's impossible to place a bet where "your fee doesnt overrun it". The fee is built in to the ticket price.
There's no magic amount they can bet where they arent paying the same proportional fee - and getting the same expected value - as everyone else. It makes no difference to them, you, or anyone else if they bet once or a million times.
@_date: 2015-04-28 07:09:47
The ticket price is whatever they bet and you are *still* missing the point. 
That first guy was only able to have such a high chance of winning because he was willing to bet so much more than everyone else. But he *could* have lost all of his wager. *He's just playing roulette*.
That he placed his bet at the last minute is totally irrelevant.

It makes me sick to my stomach that people are still using these jokers.
@_date: 2011-07-02 04:33:07
Why bother, they would just be rolled back.
@_date: 2011-06-22 03:12:29
Good idea, will do.
@_date: 2011-06-22 02:51:09
Seems likely that malwarebytes is assuming I've been botnetted and this is running without my knowledge... still I'm afraid to click 'Ignore'. I've been running poclbm and malwarebytes side-by-side for months without an issue, and googling "trojan.bcminer" returns no results.. I'm thinking they must have just added this in a recent update?
@_date: 2011-06-16 00:27:10
You know that's a cool idea, and it wouldn't surprise me if they went for it. They'd probably end up with some extra subscriptions for the hassle.
You should suggest it to the admins. They have a subreddit or something for that I believe.
@_date: 2015-10-31 20:03:51


careful, im pretty sure you can get banned here for talking like that
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:13:08
Ive said it for years, the Bitcoin community is the largest extant threat to Bitcoin. Now here we are, the protocol needs to evolve but no one can agree how. Discussions quickly turning toxic, moderators banning any dissent...
Is this the beginning of the end? I hope I'm wrong...
edit: WOW hello downvote brigade. from +8 to -3 in minutes
@_date: 2015-11-19 02:21:57
Yeah I completely agree with you
@_date: 2013-03-31 23:10:54
Oh, well I was talking about brute force attacks in general. I'm not actually familiar with localbitcoins.com. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 04:22:27
@_date: 2013-03-31 18:00:26
Thanks for the detailed response!
I must still be missing something because it seems like 1 confirmation should be enough for all but the largest transactions. I figure:
* A significant slice of the network hash rate would need to "go rogue" to perform a brute force attack
* If that did happen it would be all over the news
* Anyone with access to that amount of computing power is already wealthy
I don't see anyone with the capability to perform a brute force attack going after anything but a large target, as they would waste the element of surprise making later attacks more difficult.
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:04:05


Do you have any information on the relative difficulty of a double-spend for 1-5 confirmations? I guess I don't quite understand why 1 isn't enough.
Great post btw.
