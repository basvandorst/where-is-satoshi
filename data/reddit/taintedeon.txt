I agree 100%, I hate that these are even questions that have to be asked. Things get worse and worse as time goes by when it comes to politics as of late.

Ahhh I see, thank you!

My apologies, I didn't even think to search that as I figured it would be more or less on the front pages. Looks like I have some reading to do.

For sure!! I plan to hold for quite a bit so here’s to hoping we can make some sweet plans later in life :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:07:08
Thanks!! :)

How would I go about investing in other coins with Coinbase? Maybe I’m doing it wrong but I only see 3 options.

Damn. I wish I had a maxed Roth IRA but unfortunately I’m not in a position that I could even do that in. That sounds like one hell of a position you’ve put yourself in though and I have to congratulate you for that! That’s one incredible plan!

Definitely!! I have to say, this sounds a bit better than playing penny stocks haha.

Ohhh I see, thank you!!!

Aye but even at $1M I’ll only have $30,000. Now I do plan on slowly putting more in but it feels like it’s never enough haha...maybe I’m just overthinking it.

That sounds like one hell of an employer! No problem at all!
It sounds like you’ve definitely been playing the bitcoin craze right! On the plus side, if things go the way people think they will you might retire at 30! Haha
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:26:58
Ahh that’s true, there’s always a reason for generosity haha!
Hopefully 40 as well haha. I plan on putting in slowly over time and hopefully reaping the rewards at some point.

I feel a little bit saddened that I was only able to put $300 in and I did it around the $97XX marker...seeing a dollar increase while people are talking about retiring hurts, but being in my mid 20s also has me slightly less worried...anyone else feeling this sort of conflicted?

Oh wow, so how do I find my CoinBase identity to trade bitcoins over to the Binance account? Is it on my profile somewhere?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:21
Do people -actually- fall for this...? Who the hell would give you 1 BTC randomly?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:25:46
Ahh I see, so I’m seeing people say there are “Binance Coins”...does it transfer my bitcoin to that or is that something separate?
