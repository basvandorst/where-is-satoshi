Why would I not use Coinbase to buy things?

I had a hundred or so electrum wallets that I was playing with a while back, not much on any of them. A few bucks I guess. 
I went back earlier this year and that few bucks turned into $10 or something. 
I went over to coin base, i got my wallet address. 
I saw this message or something similar at the time
"Only send Bitcoin (BTC) to this address
Sending any other digital asset, including Bitcoin Cash and USDT, will result in permanent loss"
I do not know what those are so I ignored it, I know that I had btc because it was from last year or so before any splits. 
I open the electrum wallets and send it over to my address that i got from coinbase 
This is the address that it shows me as of today

These are the transactions from electrum to coinbase that I made.
