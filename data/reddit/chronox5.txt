The money is profit from whatever business they do. Instead of paying taxes for this profit the money is sent offshore and marked as an expense in the books.
Of course the money could also be from bribes or embezzlement.

I didn't program the site so I can't tell how they come up with their numbers but lets say their margin of error is 0,1%. That would be incredibly accurate but the error would still be +/- $ 20,000,000,000. The number is really unfathomably large.

Low or 0 fees.
Exclusive software features.
I think the main factor is that when you start out mining you look up a list of the largest pools and join the one at the top because it has to be good and safe if everyone else is there.
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:19:37
You could still solo mine but it would take very a large amount of time to find a block, so you would only get a payout after 6 months+. By joining a pool that has a few percent of the network you get a payout everyday. However in both cases the total income will be about the same.

I was just about to ask what the long flat section was. Haven't been keeping up with the price for a while now. It looks pretty wild.
@_date: 2014-01-09 08:15:20
This is a misconception that leads to dangerously large miningpools. There are 144 blocks to be found every day. Unless you are switching pools every hour the pool's total power doesn't make a difference.

Always look for the little padlock in the URL bar before entering any sort of login information. It means that the site at least has ssl in use which is an indicator that the site is probably legit. You can then mouse over to see if the site has been verified.

I did two transactions with them so far, both about two weeks ago. 
My account verification was done in a matter of days. 
First I sold about 10 BTC and successfully transfered the money using SEPA (to Austria). Then a few days later I sent about €1000 to fund my account and buy BTC because I stumbled upon an investment opportunity. Both transactions went flawless. 
The only thing that's bad is the large spread between MtGox and Bitstamp's bids which can be explained by MtGox problems with liquidity.

Bitfurystrikesback seems to send verifications to their customers that the devices are ready. These were apparently guaranteed for August, while the major part should come in October.

There are various ways but the most common would be to download a [software wallet]( like multibit which automatically creates a wallet file (which holds private keys) on your computer.
@_date: 2013-07-03 22:32:17
That's the only way to trade in my opinion. Following the hourly charts can make you go crazy and is almost never worth the stress.
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:39:11
Seconded. I don't have enough money/time to work with short spikes but a changing trend alarm would be very convenient.

I sold a large part a few minutes ago. If its at 500$ tomorow I wouldn't really mind. I had quite a nice run.
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:31:55
Always look at the volume on Bitfunder before buying. The chart is based on the last price, which can be deceiving when the trading volume is low. The IPO price was 0.0005BTC and the spike you saw yesterday came from only a few shares being traded at up to 0.001BTC. If AMC can deliver on their promises you will be quite happy with your shares anyway.
@_date: 2013-09-02 22:36:55
I'm part of a group buy for the first day batch. I hope it's gonna work out too. The most important part is that KnC keeps their delivery date promise. I think the difficulty will keep on rising like crazy for a few weeks. KnC, Bitfury and BFL will come online and Avalon's Chips will also end up somewhere.
The good thing is that after their October delivery there will be a short hiatus until the November batch get's delivered.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:56:22
That's an insane turnaround, over 400%. You wouldd have sold at 8, 16 or whatever anyway so be happy about your gains!

Since its coming in regularly it might be a dividend payment.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:50:18
It's called the spread. The easier it is to trade an asset the smaller the spread is. Local bitcoins takes time and is probably riskier than an exchange like bitstamp so the spread is high. 
Remove all fees from an instant online exchange and the spread will be close to zero.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:27:00
Don't be sad. All this talk about ceilings and testing and bubbles is how a gambler thinks. If you believe in that stuff then you most likely would have sold your early holdings at the $1 mark. The only ones who still have BTC from the early days are the guys who believe in it as a currency.
You can also buy BTC 0.00001 by the way.

If you follow the wise rule of buy low and sell too soon then it's probably not a good time to buy right now. It all depends on the timeframe you are looking at however.
For a newbie buying a small amount and forgetting about it for a few years is probably the best strategy. Trading on an hourly basis will make you go insane in no time. 
You should be prepared to lose it all, never invest money you need or don't own until you know what you are doing.

Well, there are different prices on bitstamp, mtgox and so on. So its value can be plotted at least three dimensional.

They are online but the login system is down. You can't login, the site will just refresh. This is kind of a big deal because users from the US were supposed to move shares for some assets (eg.: active mining).

Depends on how far I need to go.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:08:07
There are online exchanges like bitstamp or mtgox (which work like a broker for stocks) and there are sites like local bitcoins that will help you meet up with a person that wants to buy bitcoin directly from you. 
Eventually the goal is that you won't need to trade BTC for Dollars because you can buy everything with BTC directly.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:40:12
Gotcha. I cashed out most of it but I still have some coins bound to miners (which would be bad if the price wasn't so high).

I'm still trying to understand the Bitcoin protocoll, so bare with me. When I import the encrypted private key and provide the right passphrase the decrypted private key will be pasted into my wallet file ~~together with the adress~~ which allows me to access the funds in this adress, is this correct?
**Edit:** I read a bit more about it. So only the decrypted private key is pasted to the wallet file and can then be used to automatically calculate the corresponding adress.

What you are proposing is actually done frequently with traditional less eratic stocks although I'm still a bit confused about parts of this article: [Dollar cost averaging](
It's a strategy I would use if I had complete faith in the adoption of the Bitcoin system.
The best thing you can do is read up on Bitcoin and decide for yourself where the value could be in a few years. Since I've been on board there have been at least two times where I was convinced that the currency would disappear into meaninglessness. You sometimes have to ignore your emotions if you want to come out ahead.
@_date: 2013-05-29 09:42:00
Nah. All BTC transfers outside of exchanges are traceable so the government has nothing to complain about.

Yeah. It says in the wiki that it was about 1 cent per transaction. I don't know if there are plans to change the fee anytime soon.

Basically what happened was the guy issuing the shares first placed a few million of them at 0.0005 and then removed them from the market, which caused people to believe that there wouldn't be any more shares at 0.0005 which caused the price to spike. I paniced a bit when there were suddenly 500.000 new shares at 0.0005. The situation has calmed down a bit and the price is now slowly gaining again. It looked a lot more dramatic a few days ago. Right now I would definitely hold, since AMC is now trading on top of Bitfunder.
Note that I'm invested in AMC myself so take everything I say with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:27:22
That's why I was putting shorting in quotes. Of course its not shorting when its you're own stock you are selling. However I wouldn't call it selling high after the price dropped by 60$. By selling now they are betting on the price to drop even further.
@_date: 2013-05-01 10:14:59
So while it appears to be static for a few seconds that's only because there are many trades happening at the same value?
I like it a lot by the way.
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:45:20
This is the right answer. You most likely don't have a lot of experience with investing, so any short term actions will most likely result in a loss for you (because people who know what they are doing will profit of your actions). Hold on to your investment for a few weeks at least and decide what to do then. My bet is on three months from now.
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:55:20
I think it's people virtually 'shorting' the stock. Basically they think that it will continue dropping for a while, so why not sell now and buy back in later. (Risky)
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:03:33
You can even make something like a paper wallet where you print/write down your private and public key and they are never stored on a computer. Later when you want to access the adress you just type then into the client software or an online wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:03:02
Most early adopters do. For the other group of BTC owners it's only a vessel for speculation.
You can find some examples for shops already accepting BTC [here]( and [here]( But there are no major players on these lists.
If there is enough money on the market I don't see a reason why they shouldn't accept it eventually. (Paypal and credit card adoption also took time and they collect fees from the vendors.)
Bitcoin in its current form wasn't designed for microtransactions (&lt;€10) so this could definitely hinder adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:47:19
It depends on your settings. Usually you include a standard fee that goes to the miners so your transaction gets included in the next block they find. It's a reward for the work they are doing.
Everytime its included in a block the transaction gains one confirmation. Websites usually want about 3-6 confirmations until they recognize your transaction as valid.
If you choose not to include a fee, transactions can take a very long time to get confirmations because miners can refuse to accept them into their block. However most of the time the transaction should get picked up after a while.
The fee wasn't really a problem when BTC still had a low Dollar value but I can see that it gets significant now that BTC is worth more. There will probably be a lowered standard fee some time soon.

It's usually sounds advice. 'Definitely sell after +25% gains' is what I always read. I already got my initial investment back so now I just check every few days and relax. The ride never ends.
