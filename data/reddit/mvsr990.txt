What if you had put it in something like a Vanguard fund?

I didn't realize there was a direct connection between Backpage and the Village Voice family of alt-weeklies (most of which were sold off to split them from the Backpage-escort connection). My local alt has shrunk considerably since they stopped doing obvious prostitution ads.

My parents and brother gave me cash for Christmas (loladulthood), I really have nothing in my life that I want right now. Decided to make my first real (intending to buy and hold) bitcoin purchases - it's money I don't need that might as well have never existed - and set up a small weekly purchase through Coinbase.
I view it with some vague economic and technological interest, but mostly I'm speculating. I don't think it's terribly risky (the shadow economy never goes away) and the upside is high.

This attitude would ensure that BTC never gets used for regular purchases - you cannot ask retailers to take on a volatile currency and extra work/costs AND demand a discount.

That's their choice - they want BTC, they want to use BTC.
"Retailers will offer a discount when they want BTC" - uh, okay, so yeah it will never happen. Retailers want revenue to pay for goods and overhead.
If the event you're counting on is for the population of the dominant global superpower to have lost faith in fiat currency, BTC isn't going to save anyone. This is the same goldbug idea that shiny metal will somehow still matter after the dystopia sets in.

1 is factually incorrect. Small-population states do dictate policy to population centers far in excess of their value (economic, cultural, whatever measure you choose) as the system devalues the votes (not simply in Presidential elections) of people living in population centers. 
The rest is a non-sequitur (Clinton's campaign and existence are irrelevant) - I responded very specifically to your argument that population centers shouldn't dictate policy to rural areas and states.
Presumably you believe this would be the case with the Presidency decided by popular election - to make that argument logical, you have to accept that the opposite is happening now. You cannot have an Electoral College and Senate that don't dilute the votes (and thus power) of people living in populous states.
Now, the same zero sum dilemma is not true of arguing for direct election - one person, one vote means that by its nature, neither population centers nor rural areas are valued more than the other. 10 rural states with the population of Florida carry just as much weight and are just as valuable should they vote as a cultural bloc (which they generally already do, even more than California does).

Gambling is never a "good way to make money" - unless you're the house.
It's an even worse way to make money when the 'fairness' of the gambling isn't even regulated.

See, wasn't that freeing? You don't have to pretend to make rational arguments or anything. Just hip hip hooray.
I'm not sure what Trump has to do with it, though, we were talking about vote value and the Electoral College.

Many credit card agreements are hostile to CC surcharges - you show a price and a "cash discount" (or BTC) price, you're golden.

None of those are arguments about why it's right for rural votes to count more and for non-populous states to dictate policy to populous states.

That's a ton of effort and potential for things to go wrong for a relatively small per-transaction amount. That's why I it needs to integrate directly with existing POSes or credit card terminals - I have 10-12 retail employees at any given time, few of whom I consider 'computer literate' enough to use multiple POS setups for payment.
I would be much more likely to talk to an operator about bringing in a BTC ATM for marketing, tbh.
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:57:24


And yet you support a system where exactly that happens?


So you do think it's just and proper for votes to count more in one place than the other because "states" matter more than "people."
You can't justify your argument regarding direct election favoring "population centers" but you don't want to acknowledge that the Electoral College favors rural populations and distorts vote value.
What really seems to be important to you is that the EC got your guy elected. Perfectly justifiable response, just don't try to dress it up as anything else.


This remains a non-sequitur.

It will require a widely available debit card-like system that can be integrated seamlessly with existing POSes or credit card terminals. 
I've idly considered accepting BTC in my shops (mostly as a marketing thing) but the effort I'd have to put in to train my employees would vastly outweigh the benefits.

Got a Trezor for self-Christmas, put .65 BTC that I had in an Electrum wallet on there testing it, held off on buying the other .35 to make it 1BTC  Oops. 
Torn between rolling the dice now or waiting for a correction back down.

Why is it right for Wyoming and Idaho to dictate policy decisions to population centers?
