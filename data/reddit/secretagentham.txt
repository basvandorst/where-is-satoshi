How dare people pay for a service they are receiving. It should be free! 
They are a corporation with shareholders to answer to. They are not a non-profit and shouldn't be expected to provide services for free. We are a capitalist society not a socialist one. I don't get this outrage. In a free market you have the choice to do business anywhere you please. If this product isn't for you, move on.

Keeping all my coins in my ledger nano s and Hodling until the dust settles.

my ledger nano s is holding bitcoin in the "segwit" section, however the address for me begins with a 3. Still wont accept it. guess i'll play with it some more because i'm assuming its supposed to work.

All businesses start somehow. if you have a clear idea of what you'd like to do, and make it clear that you want to be paid in bitcoin, i don't see why not. Hopefully you can get an idea off the ground and are successful with it. Best of luck!

I am holding long term and I buy some with every paycheck. I'm bullish and can handle a dip. I have before. I'll buy more if it dips too.

If I use a desktop wallet and have my seed and private keys I should be able to claim my forked coins when one does support it right? This is my first hard fork so I'm just trying to prepare. Thanks for your response!

Glad I woke up early enough to buy in at 5700 before I got ready for work. Fly me to the Moon!

Yes. I invest no more than I'm willing to lose and I make it an automatic habit. If you make something routine it becomes normal. I've been doing this for a bit (plus using nicehash) and I've amassed a good amount of BTC. Anything you put in is worth it my friend. I just ordered a ledger nano s with my profits a bit back and will store there.

if you have a gaming computer, or a powerful work computer, you should try NiceHash. it'll get your foot in the door without much of an investment. I am building up my BTC to buy a miner myself, but that's because I don't have to pay for electricity in my apartment (included in rent). check out to get started!

The idea is that you don't actually have the keys, coinbase does. Get used to the idea of being your own bank and keep all your coins in a wallet you control.

Will these wallets also support Bitcoin gold? I'm trying to find a wallet that will help me out with that fork. Thanks

Thanks for the tip!

Bought a ledger nano s on their site and it was noted that it wouldn't ship until after November 5th. I got an email a few days ago with tracking information and I'll probably have it by the end of next week. Paid for all in Bitcoin, it was pretty sweet.

I use coinbase to buy them then transfer to a different wallet. I'm only now realizing their fees are really high so I'm also looking for new exchanges. You could do that strategy and feel good about not losing any money should this all go sideways on us. If your initial deposit is that important to you maybe you should follow that strategy. There is no wrong way of doing this imo.

Bitcoin has a very promising future and betting on this is a lot better than other bets you can make. There is actual value to what you're investing in. Enjoy the ride my friend!

i may just be ill informed, but i imagine you should be able to buy some from a bitcoin ATM. cant think of an exchange that would allow you to purchase without entering your private information.
