This is too pathetic of a comment to respond to. Get help.

Lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:45:11
Lol. Bitcoin's devs do more to keep bitcoin running smoothly without taking credit than you'll literally ever know.

Exchanges went offline for this... Tons of lost profits around the world. 
They will NOT be putting up with one each month, maybe even ever again.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:48:05
How do you explain that 18-month long completely flat line then?
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:40:08
The problem is that as BCH inevitably declines to sub $1 pricing, how will we know how much of that fall is caused by the crappy scaling mechanism, and how much is caused by the hopelessly inadequate development team?
And how much strictly due to the lack of network effects, for that matter?
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:21:24
Lol... Just wait until we're able to send out BCC to an exchange and come back here to say that again. ;p
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:47:49
And were you able to withdraw your btc?
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:24:00
Because no one is able to sell it?
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:45:55
BCH isn't being confused for bitcoin at all. 
We got lucky that the attackers don't understand branding, basically.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:46:59
Yeah, and what if I ate the moon first with a side of caviar?
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:29:58
Surely you can see that the moment there is a good way to sell BCH roughly 10 million people will try to unload using it?
There's no way to "get a good price" then... Only a way to "not walk away empty handed" at best... And many will fail at that.

I may be new around here, but even I can see that COINBASE SUCKS. 
Why does everyone suggest going to coinbase to me when I ask where to buy Bitcoins though? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:10:51
Paypal has cheated me out of 2 months earnings before... One of the big reasons I looked into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:30:08
I truly needed more FUD in my life, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:50:19
It's pretty obvious that only a very few, very techie people are going to both figure out how to get their coins out and trust a chinese exchange enough to send them in to trade.
Therefore, BCH will not crash all at once, but it will certainly have downward momentum, and I don't see a reason for Bitcoin's price to have any at all.

What it does take is a stable market that they are assured can't go away overnight due to local regulations or other things they have little control over. That could take another decade. :(
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:00:40
Sure, I'll refer to it as BCH the whole hour or so that it exists.
