I would love a program where I automatically buy back bitcoin I spend from a wallet by proxy on an exchange with a linked bank account.
The exchange and my bank not recording why I spent exactly $16.05.  I could host the details myself keeping my finances up to date for the taxman as well.

You are asking for the [M3 figure](  Funny enough, the government discontinued calculating this figure in 2006.  Two years before the largest financial crash in history that gave birth to the bitcoin protocol.


Since 2006, M3 is no longer tracked by the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed did not use M3 in its monetary policy decisions even before 2006. The additional less liquid components of M3 didn't appear to convey more economic information than was already captured by the more liquid components of M2.

Wallets store the bitcoin using a private key. Wallets use a standard protocol so there are many different wallet programs. Just like the HTTP you can use Safari, Firefox, or Chrome to see a webpage you can use any wallet program you like to personally store your bitcoin wallet and key.
Robinhood has a wallet they keep for you. You use the wallet through their software. They control the key to the wallet. Its best to never store your coins for long in a wallet when someone else has the private key.

Short-term: maybe

CashApp has a larger spread between what they charge and the actual market price of bitcoin.  Convenience comes with an added fee

Things to consider:
1. Bitcoin is only the reward token system for an immutable blockchain that cannot be forged or altered to the whims of banks or governments.
2. The energy consumption is to compete for these tokens while confirming blocks. The price you pay is voluntary and you can contribute as much or as little as you wish to win this lottery. Every ten minutes. 
Bitcoin demands as much or as little energy it takes to win this voluntary competition. This lottery could run on a car battery if that is all it took to 'win the 10-minute lottery and receive tokens as a reward.
3. What if people who develop for bitcoin ignored the token aspect altogether? What if their real prize was implementing a verification system to piggyback off of the immutable blockchain? How much you think it would be worth to pay barely anything to read the blockchain and authorize trust to A.I. driven software to perform a vital community service?

Keep in mind that there are not enough workers who are both knowledgeable about bitcoin and well versed in institutional investing to fill the oncoming demand.  
It will take some time but this is going to get big!

There should be an opensource version of this! I love the idea of a 'safe' amount to pull out at any time (like ATM machines sometimes set &gt;$300)
So the common password allows for a modest spend amount while a more secret password allows for sending total.
Now I just have to learn how to program and I'll get started on it right away!

"...or otherwise acquire.."
That includes buying.
