Us vs. them.
Agree with your mantra but don't care much for the liberal usage of the F word.

Once the app is installed, does it require WiFi or a data plan for the codes to be received by your phone?

Are 2 basic questions about Gox allowed?
Although I've had my account for a little while, I am ashamed to admit I still don't have a bunch of exchange accounts because I prefer buying crypto with cash.  But buying low on Gox is so tempting, though risky.  Here goes.  
Assuming I upload clear documents, how long does it take for a new account to be verified?
Deposits: which payment type is processed the fastest with funds credited to the Gox account and how fast is it?   I'm hoping someone's sent a wire transfer or used OKpay recently.

Good idea in theory but what if  privacy-conscious people don't trust Google and company and don't want to provide them with their phone numbers in addition to all the other info they're surrendering already?

This will soon be a great buying opportunity for those of us newbies who missed the boat...but the question is, at what point do you decide to buy during a slide like this?

How is that a scam?  11 bitcoins for $309 each seems like a good deal to me.

While I agree with your statements, how about pasting the advice here instead of requiring us to click a link to what may be your ad-funded blog?

Do you know how to block that banner?  It's become more and more of an eyesore each time I look up a wiki page

Well they made a killing during the boom of the last month, it's only fair that the rest of the world gets their chance
