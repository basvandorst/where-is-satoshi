Great info, thank you. There is a difference between store of value and speculative investment and volatility seems to be central. Do you think that, for now, this 750-900 window will hold and slowly migrate upwards as adoption  increases, or are you expecting more dramatic, volatile leaps like its transformation from the 100s?

The strength of doge isn't selling it to dentists, it's through achieving widespread adoption  as an actual currency, not an investment. 
Edit:by widespread, we aim to be the up vote of the internet, the tipping currency.

Is bitcoin being used as currency primarily, or just as an investment? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:46:03
Yeah, idk. Thin clients, maybe? Some browser extension or cross platform "app" structured like a tipbot? I know they're working on both of these. I'm curious as to the moolah platform he's building.

Woah! That's excellent! How is it implemented?

It'd be like saying i make 8 kilo cents or something

There is no data to support that most shibes are teens or tweens. Yes, there are a number of cpu miners and some of them are teenagers who can't afford gpus - so what? They're learning about crypto. Have you seen our hash rate? That isn't 11 yr olds with dear old dad's laptop. In fact, 10 to 1 each shibe that I've seen post about their personal life is mid 20's or middle aged with some money socked away. 
And what do you count as success? You're certainly looking at our charitable giving. Are we only successful when we make new millionaires who have used our currency not as a currency but as an investment? I could've bought a pizza with doge when we were 2 weeks old. That sounds like we're on the road to being a successful money to me.


We don't want to undermine bitcoin. We love you guys. Without you, there is no us. There is no 50 million market cap. There is no Jamaica bobsled team going to the olympics, no dental clinic in Topeka getting crypto donations, and other great charities. You made that possible in part and we appreciate you.  But cmon, dad, open your eyes. Look at your own history when btc used to tip people on reddit. A pokemon card used to be worth more than btc. Then people started getting rich. And now no tips. If us tipping each other means that we're children, then I'm gonna go hang out on the monkey bars. And you're invited if ya like.

yes! I'd be afraid of sending skipping a 0 and sending way too much
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:42:29
Huh. Hadn't considered that.

Nice article. Felt like I could have written it! I'm no economist, what I mean is that I've been predicting for awhile that publicity is what will set off btc again. It will rise, then fall then rise a bit and stabilize. 
Are you all trying to create more buzz? Doge got a huge lift in part due to the media buzz of the Jamaica bobsled team. That showed much of the tech media that doge is for reals. Tech media and growing general media knows btc is for real and It seems like bitcoin needs buzz that appeals to mom and pop, lowering the perceived value barriers to entry and very real technological and website-exchange-hopscotch  barriers to entry?

Good point and charitably illustrated. Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:50:40
I understand. Closer to 2.5k though :P
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:52:18
Woah, thanks

I'm in the camp of I don't want to spend .03481348 of something.
Edit: I don't mean to sound condescending.  That is just a reality of the current value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:10:20
Doge loves you.

Folks have named every moment since its initial jump a "correction". At this point it is still a gamble; especially buying this far into a jump. Buying high is not the way to go.
