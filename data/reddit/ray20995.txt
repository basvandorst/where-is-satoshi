I paid off a credit card. That’s pretty big for me

Yeah, luckily I don’t need it immediately. This was also a test just to see how the process is so I can more or less know what to expect for next time. I’m pretty patient so I’ll be alright. Thank you!

Nope. I’ve told all my friends and family and I’ve explained it the best I could and all they say is “it’s not real money why would I buy into it”. So it’s their loss, I won’t try any harder than that. However, my dad says he’s keeping an eye on it, so maybe he’s thinking about buying some.

I’m assuming maybe a dip at 15k, but nothing crazy.

You’d be better off saving up money, and just buying bitcoin.

What app provides that widget for the watch? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:14:56
Seems legit

I missed the dip as well. Have to wait for the next one I guess!

If ALL they’re putting in is a couple hundred and then leaving it to see what happens, then I’d understand. But a lot put in a couple hundred every two weeks or less. It all adds up.

Honestly it’s only worth it if you think it’s worth it. It’s not a get rich quick scheme. So if that’s what you’re looking for, I’d stay away.

I’m in the same boat. Every time I get paid I buy about $150-$200. It’ll add up soon enough.

Buy now. Buy again when it dips. Never stop buying. Never stop hodling.

Coinbase is pretty easy to use. I buy on Coinbase, transfer to gdax for free, and then I transfer from gdax to my wallet. There’s no fees for any of that (except for when you buy)

You’ll be rich in no time

Half now, half when/if there is a dip. Or go all in now. But don’t wait, that’s how regret begins.
