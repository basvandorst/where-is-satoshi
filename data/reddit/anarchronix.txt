What are you talking about, companies will switch from fiat to crypto as payment if it will be necessary, but I don't see how would any company go down with fiat, unless it was company printing it.

I understand significance of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin, I just don't see how would bitcoin replace fiat currency, the sentence above is what I'm disagreeing with. One reason is that bitcoin is not fairly distributed among people and it would not be just nor would people agree with it replacing their currency. Only fair way it could happen is if a new coin was created and everyone was allowed to get equivalent of their current fiat wealth in that coin.
