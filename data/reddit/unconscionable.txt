They may be extremely valuable, but they will never be used as currency. Economics 101: useful things make terrible currencies. The combo you want is scarce &amp; useless, yet valuable.

Fun fact! Those types of EAN/UPC Barcodes with the lines are still ubiquitous in modern warehouses, despite being far more primitive. The reason is that the fancy QR codes tend to not perform as well in more rugged conditions, i.e. being exposed to sunlight for 6 months &amp; fading, damage to half of the code, etc.
It's kindof unfortunate - I was a programmer in a large warehouse for a few years, and would have loved to cram other little bits of data into some of the barcodes we were generating (i.e. a unique UUID code for each tiny item so we could track things more granularly and know how long they have been in stock without having to piece together a best-guess with transactional metadata). You simply can't store as much info on those shorter UPC codes, unfortunately

Specifically the problem I was dealing with was that I couldn't tell one piece of inventory from another if someone unpacked a box and then repacked it. All of them looked the same to me on the per-each level, so I'd have to piece together the transaction history to "guess" which boxes could theoretically have older inventory in them.
We were trying to get older products off the shelf that had some plastic material in them that California made illegal to sell for some reason so that we didn't have to keep track of which products we could &amp; couldn't sell to California at the time (Prop 65 if I remember correctly).

Bingo - that's exactly it.
I could tell which was which as long as you didn't remove them from their larger box, and I could tell if a box had been opened / had an odd quantity or something (I don't remember exactly), but I couldn't uniquely identify each product once you took it out of it's Inner / Outer / Pallet.

If you think you can do it, build a prototype that can beat tried and true methods in some real world test!

Even with QR redundancy, warehouse ops will tell you they don't compare with the resilience and speed of the simpler ones.
These people might be scanning 1000+ codes / day by hand. The numbers don't lie

That very well may be! I've not been in that industry in quite some time, and I was just an entry level guy when I was working with UPC codes. QR codes had just started to gain some traction, and were all the rage at the time.

So does mine? Correlation implies there is supporting evidence. My argument is also precisely that there are more variables and not just one. In fact, my argument is that there are _so many_ variables, that it is not (currently, at least) possible to subject it to scientific scrutiny, since you cannot have a control group.
Currency inflation and "a whole lot of other variables" together seem to be correlated to recessions. You really can't prove that, though, because the scientific method can't be applied here. There's no control group.

Could say this is merely correlative as well:


If I understand it correctly, this is the crux of [Austrian Economic Theory](because the economy can not be subjected to the scientific method since there is no possibility of a control group, therefore all statements about Economics are speculative.

Actually, I think tungsten has a similar enough composition to fool many industry standard tests that determine whether or not something is pure gold.
Unfortunately unlike politicians and bankers, however, there's a pretty fool proof method of knowing for sure: [cutting them in half](
