Keep in mind that may Altcoins that came together to help bitcoin expose the problem (paycoin) that was happening to the cryptocommunity. They were altcoins that the Bitcoin community makes fun of and treats like shit. I think its time to come together and try to show some respect to legitimate coins with hard working Dev teams behind their coin. Most altcoins know who king Midas is (Bitcoin). If you work together you can prevent this from happening to the crypto community again, so that so many people don't get BURNED again by (Mt.gox,Moolah &amp; Paycoin) predators. Welcome to NO Regulations and Decentralization, NO RULES!  
Have a nice :)  We can succeed together or fail together, it's up to everyone. I own several different crypto currencies. Just like i have different Denomination of USD bills in my wallet.

not a fragile child, but they are so fucking rude that is why i trade all of my bitcoins for other coins and if bitcoin fails not all the other altcoin are connected to bitcoin anymore. don't get caught up in a self-delusion to think bitcoin is the one and only. bitcoin CAN fail and there are others ready to take it's place. thank you and have a nice day. i don't hate bitcoin, i mine it daily and then dump it.

the first thing your sub can do is to stop being so fucking rude to other altcoin, you're asking for me to buy bitcoin with my $ then stop being mean, that is a sure way to lose customers.

They talk about global warming and (Bitcoin goes back over $1000) maybe Hell will freeze over.
