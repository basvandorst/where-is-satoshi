How will you actually keep track of that though? There is no way to prove a new node isn't run by the same person as the old one, no?

Live more, bank less, shop less (because no one accepts this)

Lightning is disrupting Bitcoin more than anything LOL

How is it "waste"? Loans are loans.

Keep in mind how much of those fines weren't even due to the pre-crisis banks themselves. Most of BoA wasn't even from BoA, it was from Countrywide.

Card payments it is!

Still adds up for day traders given the volatility of the market. $100K limit now costs $150. Pretty ridiculous fee. I can buy/sell millions in equities for $7.
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:37:17
Exactly, so who cares? 
@_date: 2019-03-09 17:45:43
Guess they better stop at some point, no?
@_date: 2019-03-15 01:17:30
And if my node goes down or simply decides to jack up fees, what happens? What is the penalty for the node and the repercussion for the user?
@_date: 2019-03-08 01:09:41
Who cares about the benefits of interest when you're getting benefits of the ever increasing principal?
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:54:10
Anything that starts at or near $0 in value and goes up has great gains/store of value. That's the point.
@_date: 2019-03-09 17:46:20
Yeah, because houses magically assemble themselves out of wood. The biggest cost of construction is labor, not materials.
@_date: 2019-03-18 23:24:01
Can I sell someone something for Bitcoin they don't have?
People act like the only benefit of accepting CC's is convenience. People have TRILLIONS in CC debt. Where do you think all this money is going?
@_date: 2019-03-19 01:57:01
What's wrong with facts?
@_date: 2019-03-08 01:10:19
Someone pump Bitcoin for the OP.
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:38:25
20 years ago the Internet was way more useful than Bitcoin and functioning about 1000000000x better.
Bitcoin has shitty developers who know nothing about growing a technology and user base.
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:40:30
Who cares about volume when there is no indiction it's even real?
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:05:45
So taking a loan to buy a house or car is careless and without purpose? Houses don't grow on trees, you know...
@_date: 2019-03-16 21:16:39
And gold is a better store of value than Bitcoin... I mean, go back to 250M B.C. and check out the return on the gold you dug up. Pretty impressive, no?
@_date: 2019-02-21 16:58:33
So what? It's an automated system. They look for words and patterns etc.
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:50:44
Because it allows you to collaborate with other members of the private chain that you in general trust but that you don't want to trust 100%.
JPM can generally trust its employees and other banks, but there are bad apples in everywhere. JPM can trust JPM, but it can't necessarily trust 100K employees at JPM.
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:58:51
Why can't JPM have 100 internal nodes with incentives for each node to be honest and penalties for those that aren't?
If all 7B people on the planet used BTC, BTC wouldn't need 7B nodes. There is some amount of nodes for a given network, less than the total network size, for which it can be considered adequately decentralized. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 00:24:25
Yes, in theory JPM's leaders/shareholders/board could force all internal nodes to do something, but that's not really what they'd be trying to protect against in the first place.
JPM has 250,000 employees and God knows how many internal transactions or various assets. The goal of an internal blockchain network is not to stop the board and CEO from doing something bad, it could be to stop individuals, groups of individuals, business partners etc.
I'm not saying it's a security solution to every security problem, but I think it's safe to say that JPM could find enough honest people in the organization to administer nodes for the good of the company.
@_date: 2019-02-16 14:04:18
LOL. Hotel reform? What exactly was reformed about hotels?
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:53:24
Umm, how exactly does it lack immutability? Do all BTC transactions up to today somewhere become invalid just because someone tomorrow attacks the chain?
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:13:34
Uh, yeah, because no mainstream company has ever tried to sell overhyped or failed shit before, right?
@_date: 2019-02-23 01:05:54
You haven't told me though why JPM couldn't run 100 independent nodes.
How would you attack the JPM blockchain if they had 100 managers with 100 networks? Would you hack 51 of them? Would 51 of them collude and then just instantly get fired/sued/arrested?
Decentralization is relative. Every network will have different needs for decentralization and different mechanisms for rewards/penalties for honest/dishonest behavior.
There is no real risk to trying to attack bitcoin. There is severe financial and legal risk for trying to attack JPM's blockchain, especially as an employee.
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:56:08
But why can't JPM decentralize the network?
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:31:11
Nah, it's more likely just a market maneuver to get assets from non-traditional clients and charge big fees on crappy products, not because they actually think it's something terribly significant.
Just my opinion though. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 01:35:10
But, like, what would JPM stand to gain by sabotaging their own network?
I also don't think hacking 51 nodes would be and easier than hacking JPM itself. JPM is not known to suffer from large scale hacks as far as I know.
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:20:46
What kind of resources are required to sync from scratch and why couldn't you just buy a small USB device that has 99% of what you need on it?
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:56:31
I don't think so. Everyone has super fast internet in the western world and storage is dirt cheap.
Also, nothing is truly trustless. How do you know a Nano S isn't compromised? How do you know an SSD isn't compromised?
People simply choose to trust reliable companies. Why would you worry about Microsoft or Google delivering malicious products and more than you do worry about them delivering malicious code now?
Pretty much everyone already trusts a bunch of shady exchanges that could steal your money in an instant, so I don't see the problem trusting a good company to sell you an SSD full of what you need for an extra $20.
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:22:37
Why not 3Kb blocks?
Bitcoin has some of the most clueless devs in the world.
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:15:48
Because no one wants to give such broad write access to such a database.
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:42:26
Where is the state silencing him?
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:33:38
Sounds perfectly fine to me. There is a reason you're not allowed to do that.
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:26:32
Ugh. You can pay for anything with Lightning... if you are just going to pay some unrelated 3rd party to do the fiat side of it :/
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:08:05
Um, the vast majority of that stuff is actually useful and producing things of value, one of which is called "cash flow".
No one is using crypto for commerce (for the most part) and it doesn't generate cash flow.
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:49:48
Who cares? Recessions are normal economics events.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:56:41
The US also has gag orders. They acknowledge the balance needed between the first amendment rights with the right to a fair trial.
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:02:56
Uh, no, it just means people do all their banking from websites and apps.
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:18:03
And here's how they can be used:

Hyper depreciation can happen vast fast two. How long did that 90% drop in crypto take?
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:42:27
Huh? The US has done stuff like this too. 
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:59:53
How so?
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:39:22
Dude, because that was the event that occurred in March. That was when Tether suddenly changed their terms to "it's not necessarily 1:1 USD, it might also be other random assets that we determine the value of."
That was when it became clear that Tether was telling the world that Tether wasn't likely fully reserved like they claimed.
It wasn't FUD, it was right. They changed the terms because it would be highly fraudulent not to. It became clear that Tether didn't/wouldn't have the cash they claimed.
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:06:38
Uh, they claimed they didn't allow US customers a long time ago. Maybe you just never logged in until now?
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:46:17
Maybe due to the recent lawsuit. Maybe they really were allowing US customers even though they legally weren't supposed to and said they weren't.
Maybe they're very worried now...
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:12:14
I'm been policy for a while. Maybe you now just got flagged? Did you submit KYC docs to them?
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:31:45
Bitfinex lost that money a lot longer than 2 months ago! The reality is that the FUD was right, people were saying something was wrong, and Adam didn't believe it then.
Why make reference to crappy audits at all then? It's like saying "this toxic waste is slightly less toxic than this other toxic waste". Tether should not at all be commended for their audits, even in the slightest. In fact, their audits didn't exist in the first place. The auditing firm was fired and that was public info, so they didn't actually have audits at all.
