For now is there solution for raspberry ? I saw that is already a tutorial for windows.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:38:18
but is not for testnet ?
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:03:42
Not on neutrino specifically, I used the tutorial at 
In that tutorial, you wouldn't build the btcd at all. Just start up the LND node with both --bitcoin.node=neutrino  and --neutrino.connect=faucet.lightning.community and you can replace the default node with another if you prefer. That one, of course is running on testnet like you should be for now. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:04:09
Thank you. Already doing this, but is a long method :-/
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:20:45
Is there a way to give some step by step or some clear hints for bitcoin ethusiasts that want to make a node on LN ? I think that there is a lot of us who want to have a channel on mainnet
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:36:53
Why don't you trade via persons, from LocalBitcoins, small amounts ? From your city and near cities? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:32:14

He speaks about nodes via mobile wallet... Can you keep Eclair wallet opened 24/7 and earn some microearnings on testnet ?. I see that you only can send or receive... Am I wrong ?
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:39:23
Yes.. I read some more articles and i understood. I thought that would be a solution for users with btc from micropayments.  A big fee will need to be paid to use that btc, anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:08:13
What link to open from that thead ? :)). I understand very well the concept, but a payment from microtransactions is not discussed so often..
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:35:34
Thanks, i hope so! 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:30:23

@_date: 2018-01-21 18:55:26
lnd requires you to have an unpruned node :

@_date: 2018-01-13 17:51:34
No need for a node to earn micropayments ?

I bought 0.37 when it was 1.300$ and I read r/bitcoin almost everytime. (i made 0.4 because of btc ant bcash), I know that is a good advice to not incest into something risky, but Bitcoin was more than an investition for me.

Some like this. I hope that Bitcoin comunity will be on my side :). 
I'm here from 1 year ago. For a while I just read, but after that I bought a Ledger and start to help another users and also users with simple bitcoin questions. You changed my life and I'm confident that my wedding will be a success, thanks to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:44:16
I would like to know the answer too
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:10:33
Let's say that user A have 0.3 BTC in wallet via micropayments (0.0000xxx amounts). If user A want to pay to user B via Lightning Network channel and after that channel is closed, who will have to pay the huge fee to have the 0.3 BTC in the main blockchain ? 
User A will pay the fee when will enter with 0.3Btc in the channel ?
Thanks for those materials, but a payment from micropayments ,added in a channel, is not so discussed...
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:06:24
If you are precaut and go with some friend there is no risk... But yes... Is only to avoid banks

Thank you !!
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:14:44
5 days.... I have one from 12 Decemmber... You can try to double spend that ammount with a bigger fee or wait and do not try to rebroadcast your transaction
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:05:47
Actually, YES. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:34:02
Cool. I'm in.. I will let you know if I will find a bug
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:20:27
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:21:56
Thanks... I understood that you also need a full node to keep a LN node... With a lightning wallet you will not be able to earn microearnings by routing payments.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:43:14
Thank you! I understend
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:28:06
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:03:24
Will be compatibile with LN ?
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:23:31
Thanks for your detailed post. I understood this, but I don't know who will pay the fee in case the channel is closed. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:12:09

Another user suggested to use neutrino.. You make a bridge with a node and will use informations from that node... You don't need to download all blockchain

So, when i enter with an amount in a channel, i will pay the fee for miners and after that i can use that btc in channels ?
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:44:06
Blocktrail API use segwit
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:46:40
Is there a tutorial to see how neutrino works to build a node on raspberry/linux ? I can't find any. Thank you, u/EvilMrBurns!

Would be possible to use an android wallet as a node and earn some micropayments running it 24/7 ?
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:12:50
Congratulation... So you are on mainnet :) good to know ..
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:36:22
Why are you don't use Segwit ??????
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:36:36
Why are you don't use Segwit ??????
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:43:54
So... This is a problem ? You have to chose where to send your money ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:26:04
Using a SegWit wallet (addresses start with 3...... , not 1.....) you will have to pay less fees, like 30-40% less. The tx will be smaller and a block will have more transactions in it -&gt; less unconfirmed transactions -&gt; cheap fees :) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:17:54
Bitcoin network is spammed for 2-3 days with micro transaction and everybody have the same problem. Big fees transaction
and here you can view all unconfirmed transaction: 
I recommand to you Samourai wallet for android. Have segwit addresses (start with 3.... , not 1) and transactions between segwit addresses are 30-40% cheapper
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:23:06
running a node or channel for LN give you a reward ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:07:53
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:13:51
use segwit addresses!
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:34:10
Broadcasting a transaction on the last day from mempool, will add some more days.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:03:22
Please use segwit addresses. Blocktrail API is working very good.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:19:07
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:04:22
To open a channel you need to have a full bitcoin node or need to have running some programs?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:37:48
Will need to pay over 1k$. Is a transaction from many micro payments.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:33:53
read this post carefully :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:30:12
Yes, electrum use bc1 as segwit. 
From what I know, Ledger, Trezor, Samourai, GreenBits, Blocktrail use addresses with 3...

Segwit addresses starts with 3....
Transactions between segwit addresses are cheaper, 30-40% cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:45:57
Is about how long exactly need to wait...
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:38:13
Also, for FAQ: How can I know if I'm using Segwit address? R: Segwit addresses starts with 3..... or  bc1.....  and legit addresses start with 1.....

Quote from u/jonathan_white :
 "They were able to reverse engineer the closed source  (and undocumented) [APDU]( layer.
Once they did that, among other things, they were able to (a) inject their own APDU commands (which let them see the master seed) and (b) see all communication in plain text (including master public key)."
