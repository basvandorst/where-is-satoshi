If you didnt see this coming youre an idiot to think any government is going to let crypto directly compete with their currency. Especially the most dominant one of them all. The USD.  
Crypto isnt going to beat regulators. It will never replace currency either. Itll merely just be a tool used along with whatever currency. Dont be a retard. Think critically.

Youre getting downvoted because of a prediction of a complex space while making simple errors in spelling.  On top of saying if you buy high sell low you will owe uncle sam. Buying high and selling low would mean a loss and would therefore be able to be written off on taxes up to a certain amount.

Youre forgetting to factor in the price of every other valuable asset in proportion. Your theory is severely flawed.

Ya you can spin it any way you want. But no ones ever out looking for bad advice. Who knows maybe your skepticism could cause op to lose out on a pay day. Maybe it would save him from losing a few bucks. At that age theres less of a risk of financial ruin which means a higher chance at it being rewarding for op. Either way they learn a valuable lesson on taking chances.
I highly doubt a 14yr old kid is oblivious to bitcoin. Afterall it is the younger generations driving innovation.

I wouldnt take advice from someone who bought during the mania. 
Youre young. Theres not much risk for you outside of just losing a hundred. But if you plan on holding the chances of that 100 being a good investment is 50 50. I knew about bitcoin back in 2011. I regret not buying them as i almost did but backed off because i didnt want to take the risk.

Funny you say that. Because i have a feeling the markets gonna shoot up a good bit around then. My luck itll be the day before my money is refunded.

Blessed indeed. Someones gotta be the shepherd that bestows the great knowledge upon thee souls of the pitiful denizens of reddit.

Youre annoying. Shut up.

Yea they said that last year too
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:04:31
Yea well i wouldnt take advice from someone who has lost money. Thats for sure.
Those kinds of losses you damn sure didnt buy at the bottom. Apparently youre timing is/was in poor judgement. Not trying to be rude but no i wouldnt jump in line for your advice.
Also its good to see your averaging down.
