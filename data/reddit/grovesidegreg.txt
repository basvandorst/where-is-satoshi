My brother called it 'BickCoin.'

I'm not sure but supposedly Zynga accepts bitcoins. 
 I'm a 'noob' and waiting to open a 'Satoshi Slush Fund' / 'Sloppy Wallet' type account to make purchases.
When I do finally buy some 'Mafia Wars Godfather Coins' I'll post.

 The concrete industry issues you a gold star,sir. Thank you. :)

This page I've bookmarked is outdated. It's been helpful though for me as a newbie. Precious metal sites are at the bottom of the page. Amagi and BitGild are on it. Other links are obsolete???
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:10:02
I understand.

 Yes. When your core finishes synchronizing with the network those gray exclamation points (!) will turn to green check marks.

Maybe yes. Previously, I posted about a college football bowl taking place next month sponsored by Bitpay. There's an 'Official Bowl Charity,'  The Mike Alstott Family Foundation. Looks like a great cause.
Just an idea...

P.S.--Irony,they don't accept bitcoin. Our marketing department should be funding this.

"Megasatoshiaire" !!!

Impossible. Read the white papers. There's always one that finds a block first. That's the foundation of the blockchain. No double spending. And you don't find bitcoins, you get them as a reward for finding a block.

Episode 5 on February 19th is about bitcoin.
Morgan Makes ‘Cents’ Out of Bitcoin  (Feb 19) – Morgan lives off of nothing but the e-currency Bitcoin for a week to figure out whether the world is ready for a new kind of money. With all of the misinformation and misunderstanding surrounding bitcoin, Spurlock is determined to understand the pros and cons of the peer-to-peer digital currency and what its effect might be on the global economy.

Best part about cryptocurrencies is you can take them with you to your grave.

First Law of Thermodynamics states that 'nothing can be created nor destroyed.' Do bitcoins refute this? 
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:52:33
I have many questions and they're not being answered.

Is anyone planning on teaching 'mastering bitcoin,' as a course? Online and/or brick and mortar?  A curriculum that teaches bitwise operations? The bitcoin core? The QT cross platform toolkit? Elliptical Curve Cryptography? Cryptoengineering? Add or subtract any skills I've mentioned and wrap it up easy peasy? I believe Khan Academy would be great for this.
One of the many things I think bitcoin is missing is teachers. Thank you.

I have been saying this for awhile. Microsoft DOES NOT accept bitcoin. I tried twice, once for Xbox Live and once for my Microsoft Office subscription. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 11:58:47
I've been asking for this information. Certified Bitcoin Professional. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:00:41
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-03-21 23:33:27
I was looking for this. It isn't part of Khan Academy's curriculum...yet. Thank you.

Have we broken Moore's Law? Have algorithms surpassed Pythagorean Theorem as the world's most widely used mathematical formulae? If the process of bitcoin mining is using over half the world's computational power, then is it also consuming over half it's electricity? 
Can I draw a functional/scannable QR code on notebook paper? Can I put one on inanimate objects? (No,not stickers.) How about a QR code tattoo? 
How do I know if/if not my node is 'trusted?' How can I find my node's rank on the leaderboard instantly? (Thank you to those firing up nodes on Boston's south shore. I don't feel so alone.)
Are any teachers planning on a course curriculum for Bitcoin Core Operators? Cryptoengineering?
Are we expanding our product line? Drugs,prostitutes,porn and money laundering are great and all,but they have no appeal to me. I'm older and am only here because of the mathematics.
 Marketing? Public relations? Where's legal? The U.S. is full of lawyers. Are any working on bitcoin law? (I sent FinCen an application,form 314b,for a money remittance service on an individual level. I believe I'm the first American to do this! They had five business days to acknowledge and it's been over ten days.I believe I found a way to follow AML/KYC and will soon commence bitcoin sales at spot price.)
I believe cybersecurity is one of bitcoin's 'killer apps,' does anyone else believe this as well?
When will Coinbase start selling Litecoins? Will Bank of America be the first U.S. bank to buy/sell/accept/store bitcoins?
TL/DR; I have lots of questions and there's no clear answers.
P.S. --- Who is spreading the rumor that Microsoft accepts bitcoin? THANKS! (sarcasm) Microsoft DOES NOT accept bitcoin. I tried twice,once for Xbox live and once for my Microsoft Office subscription.
Their chat representative's wording, Mar 12, 2015 2:14:16 AM EST," Bitcoin is not yet a valid payment instrument for Office Subscription as of the moment. There's has been no notification when it would be available." I'm voting with my bitcoins and I lost 5 TB cloud storage in addition to Excel.
 Thank You.
