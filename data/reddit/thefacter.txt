Damn so there's a guy out there just *sitting* on *$200 million*?

Price action is much more reliable but is much harder to get good at.

I'm sort of new to this Bitcoin thing. Can anyone explain this chart/table/whatever it is?

Most of these are *inventions*. They were original, and did much more than anything before it could have. Bitcoin, however, does not fall into this list. The only thing it "solves" is centralization, which many people actually like. Not saying they're right to prefer centralization, but the fact is that people would rather have their money backed up by banks than a digital currency they're not sure even exists, whose value could go down $50 in a few hours.

I'm not ignoring that, I'm just saying Bitcoin seems very much zero sum.

Socialist here. Can confirm my sociopolitical ideologies are being strengthened by the amount of people getting fucked over by anarchy.

Wait it's like $130 at btc-e. Does that mean you could just buy it there and sell it on MtGox for a quick profit?
