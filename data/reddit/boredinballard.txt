Sounds neat!
Also neat, the mini-rig from Butterfly Labs actually uses the Raspberry Pi as a host. [Check it.](
The mini-rig is 15K but does 25Gh/s. I'm not sure about the Mini-Rig SC. It may or may not have the RPi as a host. I want one though! I'm trying to work with them to get a current mini rig before the new ones come out, then I'll upgrade to get the 1Th/s. Should have a good couple of years with that.

It wasn't btctalk it was p2pfoundation. 
I was thinking the same thing, but lets not forget that the Satoshi account on p2pfoundation was hacked later that year, it's possible that it was compromised earlier and someone else posted that.
Who knows.

Oh man, that would be so freaking awesome! Too bad dude. That would have been the best bitcoin trading exchange. 
Yeah man, the MT4 community is fantastic. There are so many indicators and bots and what not. Ha, bitcoin is so crazy though, I doubt any would work for bitcoin. But I'm sure plenty would have been written. Shoot.

Yeah, I definitely wouldn't trade Bitcoin on technicals. It is way too volatile. I like volatile currencies, but this is just ridiculous. But I would love a nice way to trade Bitcoin on a good reliable platform.

Yeah I looked it up, looks like it is just the exchange rate for now. Sigh.

OMG. I trade on Oanda. One things I have always wanted was to be able to trade Bitcoin on their platform, or using MT4. If this happens, I would be so stoked.
