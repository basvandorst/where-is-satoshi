You can laugh but it's a legal right in a lot of countries now.
Why? Because law (enforced by government) say it is a right.
So we could talk about "abstract" rights but it's more a phylosophical talk... concrete rights are laws, enforced by government.

Yeah but I mean, for a futures contract you need two people/institutions/companies signing right?
So if prices are manipulated, one of the entities is going to loose.
And being so obvious that the market can be manipulated, why anyone would be so idiot to sign a Bitcoin future contract with Wall Street?
Is just a question, I don't know much about Wall Street or futures.

Usually people who get divorced didn't think they will be divorcing when they married.
So maybe a divorce is coming but you can't see it now. Then, it's good to just protect yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:08:11


That sentence only makes sense if you live in a country that has a government that legally recognizes that there's something that can be owned (like a property).
Your "property rights" are protected by the government.
I'm not a government lover. But markets are worse than government for things like basic population needs (healthcare, basic services, etc.) and great accomplishments (for example: science, sending people to the moon, winning wars, etc.).
Markets make iPhones. Which are cool. Governments finance science, which gave us all the knowledge to make iPhones.
Without government there's no iPhone.

Even if it doesn't break your heart, there's a big problem: less people with work means less people with money. That's bad for the market and economic growth.
Even if you don't care about poor people, or that more poverty probably will lead to more crime, etc., that will affect you if, for example, you have a shop: you will have less clients.
Poor people and middle class interests are more similar than middle class and high class interests.

Rights are just a convention, written in something called the law, that the government or other institutions (ONU, etc.) make sure (or should make sure) that are not violated.
But are just that. A convention.
Rights 1000 years ago where nothing compared with current rights.
Tomorrow's rights will include probably more convention (e.g.: being able to change your gender it's a pretty new one) than today.
They are just conventions.

Despite your irony, you are describing exactly how it works.
If everything worked perfectly there would be no jobs.
No jobs = no money for buying things.
Sellers would go bankrupt. People wouldn't have jobs because seller couldn't provide jobs. Chaos.
The alternative is to have bullshit jobs like, IDK, advertising. And wars. Etc.
Automation is also a big threat to economy because the same reasons: real efficiency is a TREATH to capitalism.

All countries that are developed, developed because strong governments. USA, England, Russia / URSS (who in a few decades went from a feudal country to second most powerful country in the whole world), Germany, etc. 
No private company sent men to the moon: a government did.


You can go to Africa, they barely have governments at all. But you will be surprised: is not a paradise.


I live in a country where education is free (as in free beer), and it's pretty good, specially universities (not so good in highschool, but there are a few good ones). Free healthcare is not so good (because lack of equipment, medics are good) but you can choose a private one if you want like in the US.


Because government is more efficient than the market for having a stable society but their policies are not necessarily is good when you want to save money and improve as an individual.
Inflation helps economy (because you _want_ to spend your money because you are loosing it, so economy grows b/c a lot of people spend money). An economy where nobody spends money, specially with current economic model (capitalism) is going to crash.
Inflation is a shit but it's actually preventing everything to crash in, for example, USA. Imagine that government couldn't print ask the FED to print money... what would happen with government debt? What would happen when they can't pay salaries to people?
Bitcoin is good for the people storing it. I'm not sure is good for society as a whole in current economic system. But as an individual, is good to me.

Can I ask why are you donating to charities and not, IDK, making projects that you would like to exists? Have you consider other alternatives to donate / invest that money or just charities?
Note: I understand that donating to charities is probably easier than to change BTC for dollars because of taxes, accounting, etc. and easier than to be in charge of a project. So maybe those are good reasons.
Note2: I'm from a 3rd world country so I don't have a lot of "charity culture". I feel like that's strong in USA so maybe because I'm not used to it I see it as a strange thing.

That would be true if coporations wouldn't able to influence the government. But a lot of people in the government are just people that represent corporations.


This is kind of true but the incentive is to make monopolies and get everything, so in the long run it stills have a strong tendency to centralize power.
So there's some truth in your comments, I'm just saying is not only government's fault but the system is flawed (but I agree that other systems are not necessarily better, but for example, inheritance doesn't have anything to do with "equal opportunity" so I'm not sure why the hell is considered compatible with capitalism).

How do you explain countries like US and UK having inflation dozens of times lower than their printing rate?
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:51:41
It actually depends on what types of risks.
I think women are not so interested in tech and system, in tech idealism and in economic returns (and losses) of taking risks.
They might like some other types of risks, like dating a drug dealer or studying art (which is not really so risky if they cand find a husband later). 
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:41:27
Different interests.
Men: like risks, better (or more interested) at systematizing and pure tech, idealistic about tech that fixes society issues.
Women: less like for economic or direct confrontatio risks (they might like other types of risks like dating dangerous guys), more interested about people, idealistic about people.
Also, crypto is complicated. It's VERY complex. For understanding it you need to like it.
If you look at crypto from the perspective of a woman, you will see boring and complex stuff, nerds and people idealistic about TECH, and a lot of talks about technical stuff. And, despite a few thag made millons from this, most people are only guys in they keyboards that probably have difficulties being social.
Not very exiting from a woman perspective. If there wasn't money involved (like in the beginning) almost no woman would be interested.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:56:10
The documental "Paradox of Equality" shows that in more equal countries, there's LESS women in STEM and more in human sciences, medial sciences, etc. STEM don't give a fuck about feelings, and women feel that like a "unwelcome environment", but is just how STEM works: if you care a lot about feelings when discussing something technical then maybe you won't be good in STEM.
People tend to choose things in which they have interest in. Nobody is preventing women to get into vet, human sciences, etc. They just go b/c they are interested in.
I recommend you watch that documental.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:28:57
Printing money not always lead to (big) inflation. For example you can print it and "export it" to the third world so they can put it in their central banks as reserves. Monetary base in central countries increases a lot more than inflation.
Things that also lead to inflation: 
Redistribution of wealth (more for the rich). For example, if the salaries increases the supermarkets can increase the prices of the products so they win more. This can only work if salaries are increasing in general I guess, which should be a good thing, but if supermarkets are an oligopoly then that increase is eaten by them.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:34:59
I will add that besides the risk (which is a good argument), the % of women in computer science is very low. That's another factor: if you don't understand bitcoin then you are more afraid to invest in it.
Also, why risk if men can risk and they can choose the ones who won? :D

No. That's an assumption. You don't know why neither we, we just theorize that maybe it's just because in general they are not interested, because nothing prevented them to enter other fields like fashion, veterinary, psychology, etc.
Nobody would say "women in general are not interested in human science" because reality disproves that.

I have a question related with this.
I can send multiple transactions to a wallet without exposing the wallet public key? (so it would be "quantum resistant" at least as current understanding of it)
But when I use it I should move _all_ in that wallet to other wallet/s.
So I can load my wallet multiple times without risk, right, if I don't spend what's in that wallet?

That's not true. In societies with MORE gender equality there's MORE "division of labour" between the sexes, because they are more free to choose what they want. Check the documental "Equality Paradox" or something like that, it's on YouTube.

Capitalism also centralizes the power, just not in the state (but in private corporations and owners of things).

Hong Kong or Taiwan are not countries. It's true they have low taxes and are kind of independent regions but for example Hong Kong has some state intervention: 
"there are still many ways in which the government is involved in the economy, some of which exceed the degree of involvement in other capitalist countries. For example, the government is involved in public works projects, healthcare, education, and social welfare spending."
Also it would be interesting to question if those "free market" cities/states can really exists without the protection of big countries which are state-oriented and have big armies funded by the public. My guess is: maybe not.
