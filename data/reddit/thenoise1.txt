I could see it sailing past 100k before it settles back down.

On the next true bull market. Could be six months or could be after the next halving. When it happens it will happen quick. It will probably settle back into the tens of thousands after the new extreme top.

A different point of view:
I'm a photographer so I work with digital photos often and it strikes me that the "black" background is not black.
Every color has a hex code and this particular color is:191a19 
The "yellow" color's hex code is: f2921d
The white is just white: ffffff
There are also RGB numbers associated with these colors.
I don't know enough about crypto to use these two six digit (or one 12 digit) codes for anything.
But again it's very striking to me that they didn't just use a black background. why?
my BTC address:

So say we find a 12 digit code.... how do we go about using that? askin for a friend

This seems like what it might be to me too. I see a swing up to or past 100k with a possible ceiling around 110k or so, then there will be months of bounces down and up with the 20ks range being the bottom resistance until the next bull.

I mean, I’m was just giving you a hard time...but really, it’s way easier now  to buy a btc than it was at $7.

I’m buying, and if it drops lower I will buy more. Something I’ve learned in crypto is buy and sell when you can’t believe how low/high the price is. When you get that feeling, go against it and make your move.

I’m sure it will zoom pass 100k on the next true bull run before it falls back to a 20k-50k level. The only question is when. I believe it will happen in the within the next 1-3 years.

you know it this "At a smaller valuation" statement works for last time...and the time before that. You are just afraid of uncertainty.

My bank statement looks just fine, same as my crypto bags, and my real estate hlodings.
Every time the market drops ya'll thinking it is finally the end. "This time is different", you say. It's only because you are scared of uncertainty. In reality this is the perfect time to buy more. If it drops more, buy even more. Do you remember that video games lasted 10 years before they crashed in 1984 never to come back? What about Ebay, Google, Amazon after the dot com bubble? Of course we were going to have a bubble to purge a lot of the bullshit that's out there. That is just the way of nature. However digital decentralized currency is here to stay. It's a gamble to know which ones will triumph in the end, but that is the game we signed up for.

You’re sentiments have been echoed exactly every time there has been a major correction. The hype is over? Thats already happened 3 times before. The fact that you think we’ve even gotten out of the early adoption phase lets me know your perspective is off. Remember in 1984 when the video game fad passed never to come back? What about the dot com bubble that killed google, amazon, ebay? We don’t know what crypto will look like in 10-20 years, but I believe it will be something larger than we can forsee.

Could you charge interest in another currency? Or maybe there could be an interest specific coin obtained by lending instead of mining? 
Just spitballin here.

On the next real bull run it’s going to break 100k easy before coming back down to the 30-50k range to start the cycle all over again. It could go to a new ATH in 2020 like you said without having gotten to the point of a new November style run. But it will eventually find that movement again, and when it does we will surpass 100k for a time.

Yeah because the web bubble and the housing bubble left us all homeless and without internet companies like google and amazon. You do realize this “bubble has happened 4 times in Bitcoins lifespan already.

And I will be there with more money to put it when it gets there
