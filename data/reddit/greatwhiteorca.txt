Ohhhh I see the supply decreases I thought the incentive for the same amount decreased. And I know mining already isn't as profitable as before. This makes sense though thanks

Yooooo could you actually list some of that info? I have no idea about twitter or who to follow and any credible news sites because I do all my research on Reddit besides reading white papers and google. I've just never twittered and don't know The Who's who but I'm internet savvy.

So with less incentive the price goes down? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:17:27
So with the contracts set to expire on the 17th would they want the price to spike higher or lower closer to that date? I'm confused

When and what is a halving? I mean I can guess what a halving is but is that something that is for sure going to happen?
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:12:39
so they want it under or over?

have you don't it recently? I have twice in a week and a half and it took 3 days each time and one got sent back and is still in limbo. I seriously don't know wtf they are doing that takes so long. Wires should work as you say but apparently not for me and coinbase recently

What is with these sell walls? there's got to be strategy at play. Is price usually effected a certain way from them? e.g. a dip in price by a few percent after either way? I've watched one make the price drop and several do nothing so I can't decide what my novice brain thinks haha.

I've been waiting 2 days for mine did one earlier in the week and it was next day because I did it at night. Think they're bogged up its killing me I was trying to buy at 1300....

haha so fucked people are converting back to btc as soon as its an option
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:03:19
Do you need to have your holdings in BTC to receive the forks? I have a few alt coins that trade pair with BTC so I'm assuming I don't get them in that Case? Is there a way to know when forks are and trade back for btc and get the fork then rebuy the alt coin if it still seems like a good bet. Wouldn't want to miss a fork in the long run

I mean theres the G20 summit on Monday I believe that's close enough for people to get weak hands or to exploit weak hands. It's like when people sell alts before a rebranding or something because they know it's going to shit the bed.
But honestly it's just been going down naturally anyway so shit like that is just more fuel for the fire since it's speculation what's going to happen.

many of these people are selling to simply buy lower.... they're still be here

Got a time for that bud? I'm thinking tomorrow at 7-9am PST 6050 low. I have no idea what I'm talking about but that is my gut.
