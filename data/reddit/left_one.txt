I'll agree that it's a fool's notion that the Internet could ever be free of morons.
I'd like to see discussion bitcoin without people talking about vague-nonsense, *excuse me*.


So the government couldn't transfer the coins to their own address? You make such bizarre and *nonsensical* assumptions. I mean, it's not as if we are reading an article where the government immediately converted bitcoin assets to U$D. ... *oh wait, we are*. So to assume that the government would do anything but ensure the security of the asset they are seizing is just damn foolish.


My point is that there is nothing about bitcoin that would prevent it from being seized by the government. In fact, unlike an MP3, the government can 'spend' the bitcoins to themselves, fully transferring ownership. So while you can create an infinite number of copies of a stolen mp3, or leaked document, the government can actually obtain total control of a bitcoin, *unlike any other digital asset*. So the reality is that bitcoin, unlike any other digital asset, is much easier for the government to seize. In fact, it's entirely possible. 
So any latent suggestion in your posts about how bitcoins are *government proof* is **utter fucking nonsense** because the government is the entity that will lock you in jail until you disclose your private key.

You mean like the trail of incredibly skilled development oriented positions like a 3d graphics hardware engineer in the early 80s? I'm not sure what evidence there could be that he learned c++? Would it prove him as satoshi? Not really. Anyone can learn a programming language so it's seems like a really useless point to use to tear down her argument (which you failed to do with this strategy anyway).


You don't provide any evidence that he *didn't* learn c++, so why should anyone even bother with your arguments in the first place? At least newsweek offered a trail of highly skilled positions that this Satoshi worked in, and if you think a 1980's 3d graphics engineer **wouldn't** have a significant knowledge of programming, I'm wondering who exactly you are trying to kid?


Umm, no it doesn't. I get that you *say* that, but what you need to do is provide a logical argument that shows how these 'coincidences' somehow unravel themselves. 
As I asked numerous other people in this thread - if it's statistically unlikely that this is Satoshi (a laughable assertion **entirely devoid of evidence**) because th


Sure - but I didn't respond to you in regards to my beliefs, but to ask you to support your arguments. Which you've been unable to do. I'm not here debating opinions with you, you are saying there is no evidence that this guy could be Satoshi, well there is, you just prefer to ignore for no valid reason. You have no first-hand sources for any strong claims (like this Satoshi's experience with c++) so I'm struggling to understand how you can even bother to question the original reporting for that. 
Your matrix consists almost entirely of exaggerations of newsweek's points to unfavorably deny them. Newsweek claims that bitcoin's creation is in line with Satoshi's unemployment period of 2001 and onwards, but you say that it's unlikely that he didn't start in 2001. Well Newsweek didn't say he started it in 2001, they said his unemployment started in 2001 and that bitcoin's creation is within such parameters. So what's the deal? Are you disingenuous? Foolish? Don't understand english. I'm going with one of the first two. I guess I have a really hard time believing that you could take the time to write out what you did, but not realize the faulty premises you consistently use.
I'm not even saying that this is the right Satoshi - but if you guys are going to argue about this you kinda should make some damn sense.

Did you even bother to fucking read what I said? Even if Satoshi says it's him in the interview - **WHAT FUCKING DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE?** Releasing the interview would do nothing except justify the behavior of douchebags on the internet. 
We can't take Satoshi at his word. So what do you think that recording is evidence of besides the fact that they *had* a conversation? You are so fucking deficient!


Ok - but that's a significant difference from what you started the thread with. And like I've suggested numerous times - pretending as newsweek is pulling a tabloid here is to reject the history of journalists maintaining their sources.


I read the article just like everyone else did. I think you might have significant lapses in your comprehensive ability to think that there was something she claimed that was widely unsourced save for the assertion that he is Satoshi, which is obviously something that cannot be proven by Newsweek. You understand that even with IP logs - they still could never actually put Satoshi at the keyboard, right? They'd need video too. 


Sources **are** source material, shit man. Don't get fucking semantic with me like that. Why don't you explain how you think that somehow breaks down in my example (especially with the context of the supreme court's decision on such protections)?


Hello, you fucking moron. I did know they had a chat - I asked you why you think it matters. Work on your fucking reading comprehension, mate. Satoshi has always denied any attempts to claim his identity, so obviously any claim is going to go against his word. 
What sort of fucking journalist asks a murderer if they did it and then solely bases any decision upon that murderer's insistence? Satoshi **can't** be taken at his word. What sort of shit journalist (or all around intellectually incapable individual) are you to not realize that???


Umm the only oversight here is yours. She doesn't say it's her word against his. She says it's the list of incredibly coincidental facts about this Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto vs **his** word. You are so fucking stupid you should be embarrassed for arguing any of this. Even more so for the shameful stuff you pulled out in this last post. Is the only way to argue against me to make up a bunch of shit I never said? Really??

No, I implied that there is no need to divulge source information **at all**, if you think that's the same as being a tabloid, then you are *entirely* ignorant of history. Incredibly ironic as a journalism student. That's my point. 


So you think that the only time a journalist *shouldn't* have to divulge sources is when the gov't compels them? Or does that actually demonstrate the furthest extreme of the principle that journalists should be able to protect their source material as desired?


I'm confused - do you think that they have some interview with Satoshi and he secretly admits that it *was* him? They didn't suggest that - so I'm not sure why you would make up such nonsense. The author of the article explained their thoughts as to why they think that guy is Satoshi - revealing private conversations with him aren't going to do anything else to substantiate that one way or another considering that all he ever did was deny it *anyway*. Really now....


Yes it does - they don't have to supply their sources just because *you* (or anyone) doubts their work. As I said before in this post - if you think that outright makes them a tabloid, then you are on the wrong side of history.

I never said that introducing his own cryptography algorithms would've been better, it just would've actually required significant knowledge of cryptography and not just the ability to read an API.
I'm hostile because do you see your posts? If you don't know anything about cryptography where do you get the nerve to tell people who a real crypto master is? Would you know a real crypto master if he SHA-512'd on your head???? Sure - I'm rude, at least I'm not spreading the virus of my own ignorance in a wanton fashion.

Do you think people aren't interested in finding out who Satoshi is? Obviously that's not the case - so someone is going to. Satoshi is entitled to deny it all he wants, she is entitled to share all the information she has that suggests he is Satoshi.
To be honest, I have a hard time understanding why you think this guy *isn't* Satoshi. Because he denied it? Well - that doesn't prove anything. As if there is another Satoshi Nakamoto in the world who has years of experience developing engineering, live on the west coast of the US, speaks english, etc. This is obviously the best Satoshi and if you prefer to live in a world where that is 100% certified, then you might as well kill yourself because this entire universe lacks that level of assurance.

What the fuck do you know about cryptography to determine whether or not someone is a crypto-master??


Ok - thanks for clarifying that you don't know what the fuck you are talking about. Satoshi only lucked out in using alogrithms that *didn't* have secretly compromised prng's. So either he knew something the entire world didn't, or he lucked out. I'm going with lucked out because nothing else about Satoshi's behavior suggested he understood anything about the fundamental differences between either of the elliptic curve algorithms he had to chose from.
And by the way, he didn't implement his own crypto algos. He only ever used public ones - so I think crypto-genius he is **not**. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:01:51
You are getting your order mixed up. MtGox weren't the first people to be fooled by it, they were the last people to modify their transaction system to account for the malleability vulnerability. 
Other exchanges noticed that their wallets were not reporting information consistently and then shut down their withdrawals. Mtgox noticed that they were losing money because they didn't properly track transactions ontop of the malleability issue. Big difference. In one exchanges didn't process transactions because the info wasn't being reported consistently, in the other, mtgox processed incorrect transactions **unknowingly**
Unless you think that mtgox should only check transaction IDs when verifying transactions then sure. It's just that all the other exchanges already moved past that paradigm where they are checking for a more accurate tuple of info.

Are you asserting that there is a known amount of experience with C++ that newsweek would have to corroborate exactly?
Like, you don't think that Satoshi could've already been developing code in Assembly (he worked on hardware systems) and learned C++ in his free time? Or on **any** of the classified projects he worked on?
Like - what would you think was necessary to develop 3d graphic computer systems in the 1980s - not a knowledge of C? 
You are failing to establish a premise to base your point off of. So what if newsweek didn't establish a timeframe for his c++ development? It's clear he could have the experience and contrary to what you *insist*, your rebuttal does not demonstrate that he couldn't have the experience.

@_date: 2014-02-13 06:16:58
No, mtgox shut down first. They shut down because they've been incorrectly booking transactions. mtgox publicly blamed it on an issue in bitcoin that while known, was not seen as a pressing issue. Other bitcoins exchanges weren't tracking based upon the transaction ID *solely*. They used a tuple of in, out and txid confirmed, which defeats the attack. That's the current workaround and also a general best practice. 
Since then someone and/or thing is exploiting this vulnerability on a purposefully disruptive scale. They've pushed the protocols tolerance for this issue to an extreme and are forcing the developers to come up with the solution. Bitstamp's problem isn't that they were being tricked by your attack and booking. They can't process their transactions because they are unable to return enough confirmed tuples. 
At most mtgox's big stink has lead to enough awareness of the issue for someone *else* to take it to the extreme. Don't confuse that with everything else you've written. I don't think anyone is denying the problem exits, but this ddos issue is not what mtgox suffered from.
I kinda pointed this out earlier. Writing a bunch doesn't change any of that. Did you read mtgox's statement? The first one? or the edit? Maybe there are more edits now. I stopped checking because it doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:28:59
Right. Given the Satoshi situation, we can't even really apply any directionality in the proving a positive vs a negative as any of these scenarios can just as easily be inverted given the absolute mystery that Nakamoto is.
Frankly, I don't think taking him at his word is reasonable considering that if one was to game theory Satoshi's actions - this Satoshi is par for the course. To assume he isn't lying is as big of an assumption as *any* that could be made in this investigation. If anything, you should be explicit that your assertions are based upon taking this Satoshi's words at face-value. 
I'm not going to go into your analogy, because it's not absolutely direct. So while it might provide a series of logical statements that follow, it's not paralleled to Satoshi because the assumptions one must make in either scenarios are radically different. 
I have a question for you - let's say you are Satoshi and you want to remain secret, what would you do? Deny it? Sounds about right.
What if newsweek found a Satoshi, but it wasn't you (the real Satoshi)? Well, you'd probably go online and post saying it *was* you. That would add enough confusion to the situation to ensure it was never fully resolved. But we aren't seeing that here. What we are seeing are constant denials that are absolutely in-line with what one would expect from Satoshi. 


As I said before, while I appreciate your effort and reasonable discussion - this is where the leaps start. It's not exactly a direct analogy as your assumptions aren't direct. 


Well - not really. If this situation were comparable, you'd be a person who has a history of working in foreign language departments, or other related fields. There'd be much more to debate about your history than simply the facts of what you did or didn't do. Notice how we don't even really know too much about what Dorian has or hasn't done? It's not a direct analogy, so I hope we can continue the conversation in Dorian hypotheticals.

You have a fundamental misunderstanding of bits and bytes if you think there is *anything* about bitcoin that differentiates it from any other digital technology in regards to a federal authority's abilities to seize it.
Referring to the blockchain in your argument would be a rhetorical fallacy as I never said the coins can be taken from athe blockchain. The government need only to seize any wallets and private keys associated with them.

Because of fucking logic, numbskull. 
That's like trusting a murderer to admit their guilt. Satoshi has only demonstrated that he would deny any claims - so why are you waiting for him to say he is? That fucking completely defies logic you damn fool!
Satoshi is in question - he cannot be trusted to account for which he stated A) he won't account for and B) he doesn't have to account for.

Are you a fucking moron? I addressed this question. Anyone that wrote a cryptographic algorithm (not what Satoshi did) might be worthy of that. Someone that was a cryptographer would be worthy of that title, perhaps. But that's not what Satoshi is. He developed a currency system. It utilizes cryptography, but so does every webserver. Writing a webserver doesn't make someone a crypto-master. Hope you can see why you'd actually have to do something significant for cryptography (which Satoshi **hasn't** done) in order to earn such a title. 


Can you?
Who the fuck are you kidding? Can you even name **one** cryptographer? Do you see me titling people as masters of cryptography just because the word is used around them often? Naming actual cryptographers (which I'm only going to wiki anyway) isn't necessary to demonstrate that this is a nonsense argument. 
Changing the world doesn't make you a cryptographer. Satoshi created a currency system that changed the world. This currency system relies on a variety of concepts **including** cryptography. I once again ask - what's novel about Satoshi's usage of cryptography? Can you even come close to explaining that? 
Here is a hint: using cryptography to prove ownership is not innovative - that's how public key cryptography works. 


Well - it wouldn't obfuscate anything. So do you understand that? Do you understand how your question does nothing to dissuade my argument? Do you understand *that*? I'm guessing not because you decided to argue this foolish point *again*.

Bitcoin's market cap is most definitely the market's current valuation of the network, with bitcoins being the stock. Yes it is true that it's the transactional unit as well. They aren't mutually exclusive concepts. In fact, that's the whole deal with bitcoin. The transactional element is entirely arbitrary anyway as you are able to trade in incredibly small divisions of bitcoins. So having 1 btc or 10000 or .00001 is only as relevant as how many dollars you can turn it into, which is of course *always* a bet that these bitcoins will be worth *more* than the dollars in the long run. 
Sperging out on the fact that western union makes money a slightly different way is entirely ignoring the fact that it's market cap is a reflection of it's utility (aka, that they *will* be able to generate transaction fees), so the ad hoc attack came from my frustration with your inability to grasp the simple concepts that you put forth yourself. 
Mining is the federal reserve inflationary policy in bitcoin, and the act of mining is the access to the fed overnight window, essentially. While the conversion of bitcoins to dollars will obviously always depend on the scarcity of bitcoin, it is so only in an entirely arbitrary sense. Of course, due to the fact that you don't have to be goldman sachs to access the fed window in this paradigm, **everyone is fucking lining up**. Well, relatively speaking. 
People that are mining now, and buying bitcoin to save, are betting on the fact that this transactional network will continue to provide it's utility into perpetuity such that they will be able to trade their bitcoins into something more useful later. Of course due to an entirely arbitrary design decision in the bitcoin protocol, these people who got in early will see **extraordinary** appreciation of their transactional reserve units. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:17:52
It's not a direct analogue and I never said it was. In fact no one said it was. They are using the best example they can find for an independent transactional network. I get that you like bitcoin, but it doesn't mean you have to act like sperglord that doesn't speak english.

Have you ever considered if it takes that much research that *maybe* it isn't quite so revolutionary?

no, but seeing as how the bitcoin-western-union doesn't take cash and only bitcoins, it might explain why there is an inherent value in bitcoins themselves that is derived from the utility of the Bitcoin network

No, it would be like using the market cap of western union to determine if buying a western union outlet would be a good idea. 
They are saying that it's already nearing the cap of a popular legitimate utilitarian business model in the United States. It's basically the only thing anyone can point to that would suggest that bitcoin will probably stick around for a while. Because you know, it'd be hard for a network as large as, say, western union, to disappear overnight.

Yes - if all the US banks start exchanging BTC between them the US economy will finally take off!!!!!
