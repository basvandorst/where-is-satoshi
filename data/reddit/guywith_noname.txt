I wouldn’t be surprised if they introduced and adapted to flying cars first.

Would be awesome if 7-Eleven or family mart, started to accept crypto soon. I read some discussion about 7-Eleven possibly partnering with OMG (don’t quote me, not sure). But they are for sure interested in the crypto-sphere. BTC is globally recognized and easier entry to begin with if they did enter.

Yea! This store has everything and so much traffic coming in and out. One of the largest tech stores in Tokyo and they have multiple stores throughout the area.

That’s awesome. I’ll check out the site. I definitely think that any business accepting crypto should be talked about and mentioned more often. Most powerful marketing tool is word of mouth.

Mass adoption in the awakening.

He or she is pro crypto. That’s always good. Easy conversation starter to spread awareness. Which we all need. Not everyone knows what hodl means. And if they do I’m sure they are too scared to rob him. Roughly 30% of Americans carry guns. Also maybe they bought in early when it was under $100 and they hodl to get that. Y’all need to stop hating cause they got in earlier. Smh.

Lol the littlest of things matter. And it’s not a username. It’s a team name. Clearly you don’t play and can’t relate. The big picture is awareness leads to adoption. Big or small, it’s catching someone eyes. Let me guess you totally radicalize everything selling your home for btc, closed all your bank accounts because banks are frauds, refuse to shop anywhere unless they accept btc, troll the internet telling people they aren’t doing enough as you to promote bitcoin and drink out of a mug that says BTC or die. All in the end if someone promoted Bitcoin naming their fantasy football team Bitcoin is ridiculous. Then take the long stick out your ass cause your not doing enough to spread the awareness.

All the guys in my league think Bitcoin is illegal and Ponzi scheme. Even breathing the words Bitcoin is bad taboo. So I named my team Bitcoin to make them say it and think about it. When I win, Bitcoin wins. Breaking barriers.
