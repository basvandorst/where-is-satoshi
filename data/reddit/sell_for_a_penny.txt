Because when I talk about Bitcoins in person now, 99% of the time I wish I could have quick-saved and quick-loaded before I initiated the dialogue as it becomes immediately apparent the conversation is structurally doomed and will not result in any productive discussion.
Online communities allow you to filter through that process more efficiently, but at the cost of a direct social bond with the people that you are able to converse with. Also online I have the anonymity and defense of "my opinion" so I am not burdened with the fiduciary duty I would have when I make comments in person given my position. AKA I can just say what comes out and not have to do 500 hours of research and analysis to fully back a formal report.
And as for illuminati, I came from the very bottom rungs of socioeconomic society as a child, so if I have been truly selected by The Order, they have yet to tell me about it :C

This goes pretty deep into trading theory, so I won't get into it (lots of good books on liquidity analysis if you are interested though). A common challenge for massive money managers is how they buy ownership of a company while moving the price as little as possible. However, it does happen, and it is very possible to buy the entirety of any asset with only a limited premium. You can see countless examples of major public companies that are bought out over a long period of ownership accumulation (typically done very very very quietly).
But two **major** warnings:
1) Bitcoin and an actual company are not comparable asset classes. Equities, over the long-term, grow organically. You can own 100% of a company without ever selling it to anyone and still gain wealth time due to that organic growth. Bitcoin (or gold) does not change organically. Owning 100% of it and never selling means you will never realize any form of gain. That's why Bitcoin is a commodity and not comparable to equities or fixed income.
2) In a rational market, the current price is the balance of a diverse set of views for what the asset is worth. This is why you can buy most of almost any publicly traded good in its entirety with a very limited premium (takeovers rarely happen at more than 50% or 100%). If the market suddenly thinks the value of the underlying is worth more just because it was worth more yesterday, you have a nonsensical feedback loop and that is the precise mechanic that causes a bubble to occur. This is also why most institutional investors would not put money into these assets because a massive amount is held by people who will instantly liquidate the moment it looks like the party is over.

I'll refute with a quick counterpoint. Current BTC market cap is $150B. What percentage of the market do you think would be willing to sell their BTC (which is right now &lt;$10,000) at $200,000? I would hazard a guess that nearly all holders would.
So the cost of nearly full buyout of the asset class is max $3.0T... Now, Blackrock manages over $6.3T, meaning a single firm could literally buy out the entire asset class at even the most exhorbitant price run assumption and it wouldn't even take up half their AUM.
Obviously a simplified example but there you go. Except buying out a company gives you 100% of a company. Buying 100% of a currency is actually nonsensical because suddenly the currency has no utility because nobody uses it anymore.
Ergo way too small to make plays.

It's literally what regulation is. Someone tries to take advantage of the public, and the public aggregate to retaliate and put them out of commission. This process becomes streamlined and formalized and a governing body is formed to deal with these cases quickly and efficiently when they come up.
These bodies only exist because the majority of the population in the relevant industry care.

To each their own. What I will say is that if you have a 25 million people flipping a coin once each day every day for 100 days, you're probably still going to have a few hundred people that got heads &gt;90% of the time. (Random numbers - someone else can run the math if they want)
A disagreement on whether or not the track record of those people is due to inherent skill or luck will be structurally unproductive because there's no reasonable evidence to be drawn on either side. I've made money at casinos playing games that I know for a fact have, mathematically, a negative expected value but there is very little useful discussion to be had for why I won.
Rather than argue I would respond with this: if you think you have a fix on the market, keep scaling up that investment, see if it works on other markets, other commodities, etc., and don't stop and keep doing it bigger and better. Try and make a few billion. If and when you do, remember to reach out to your old internet friend here and we'll get a drink. You'll laugh in my face, but since you are richer than me at least you'll buy me a few rounds.
But while you're doing that, save enough away each time so if/when you go bust, you still have a few million to fall back on. I absolutely wish zero ill will against you if you think you're right, and trust me when I say I will be the first one to read your op-ed on the Wall St. Journal because it's going to be a fucking awesome story.
I like being right about being disciplined and skeptical, but I'll like being wrong even more when you crush my paradigm and viewpoint by proving me wrong. That's why I made this account.

Let's dispense the discussion on gold, financial infrastructure, commerce, and all that rest because we're as aligned as we need to be. However, I would recommend that you reconsider your view that a derivative is necessarily incomparable to the underlying asset. Gold, USD, option rights, etc. are all things that 99.9% of regular people will never really physically hold more than a tiny fraction of what they actually have a claim to, so I see very limited physical difference between them. If the end vision is BTC as a mainline means of exchange, it's going to be regulated, which also means that most people will let a third party manage their actual crypto because they will be secured by the government. The same reason why a regular person doesn't store his personal cash under his mattress, the average person in a crypto new world order is going to let some other party (most likely a bank) handle the logistics because the government will protect them if it goes under. Regular law abiding citizens don't want the hassle of carrying $100K in a suitcase to buy a car, and the same goes for having to deal with managing cryptos securely.
I have been following this topic (very casually) for half a decade now. But like dozens of other potentially disruptive technologies (green tech, thorium reactors, CRISPR) I have gone to conferences and taken meetings with the pioneers and leaders of these industries as it behooves oneself to track all these things during their infancy. And I am sorry that something which you clearly are very passionate about is something that I and many of my peers have deemed unworthy of institutional participation. But you have very fierce competition. There are many potential revolutions and technological frontiers today where people are building blueprints and visions that could solve the world's energy puzzle, or the genetics puzzle, or even our understanding of the very physics that keep us rooted to our galaxy... and they all are clawing to get the full backing of global capital allocators. Bitcoin and cryptos are indeed special and unique, but there are a lot of other special and unique things that also merit tremendous attention. Simply put, you don't hear the dispair of the leaders in these areas who are equally frustrated and determined to revolutionize humanity because they don't attract that masses of retail investors seeking to make their riches by just following the shiny light, and thus none of the media coverage. But we notice each and every one of you, and even if you might not see it in the self-absorbed suits with shiny rods up their rears, we hope just as much in our cores that all of you can succeed. Or at least some of us do. But our whole professional mindset is in trying to figure out why it will not work, and how it can go wrong. You guys are the dreamers and visionaries, and we are the ones trying to shit on the parade. But we are also the ones that manage your loved ones' pension funds. We're the ones that make sure our institutions of higher education have their endowments last for ages to come. And we have to figure out how to deploy a very limited amount of capital to get the most we can back. If you've ever been on either side of a local VC or angel committee, you'll know how difficult and heartless the system could be. If we could give everyone a few million to take their shot at whatever it was they were pitching, we would. But we can't. We need to bring the discipline so that the visionaries can focus just on the passion.
Anyway, if we're going to go into a deep nuanced discussion of crypto mechanics then I'm going to need to go pull out my notes from a long time ago. But to fully reconciliate what the two of us have said (and let me state for the record that your specification of 51% attack is the technically correct definition), you are going to need to take a long journey with me and my interpretation of this whole space. I have studied cryptos very carefully before, because that is the only way you can truly understand an investment. When this first came out in 2011 I took 2 weeks away from the office to participate in an grueling boot camp whereby each participant was guided in coding their own protocol. I spent 6 months before that relearning C++ syntax every night just so I would qualify. (And I am not too proud to admit that I often work 80 hour weeks but still squeezed out that time to sharpen up my coding even at the cost of my health because that's how much conviction I have in beating out everyone else in truely understanding investment opportunities.)
My understanding now is quite rusty from when this first came out. But there 3 general principles I know that are relevant here. The first one is that a network attack can be attempted by any single/collective entity that controls any proportion of the total network hash rate. Depending on the underlying protocol, there is a gradient function for the probability of success (muddied by countless other factors) and degree of control that you could accomplish that curves all the way up to 50%. So it's not a black-and-white flip a coin situation. The second one is that there is a myriad of designs that can be augmented into newer protocols (i.e. not Bitcoin) which would reduce the efficacy of such attacks. I would be lying if I said I can recall exactly how those mechanics could work, but I recall at the time there were two schools of thought at the time (2011), and one of them involved some sort of chronological marker beacon which would normalize against spontaneous spikes in total network hash rate and somehow redistribute/reweight the network. However, these countermeasures come at significant cost to the underlying efficiency and computational cost of maintaining the network.
The third one was from sitting down and talking much more recently with Vitalik Buterin (founder of Ethereum) where I was hoping to gain insight from someone who managed to walk into the already wild crypto scene and take it to a whole other level again. And one thing that he said stuck to me, and I don't fully understand/comprehend exactly why it was the case (and maybe you can help me) but here it is: Owning hash power, owning actual cryptocurrencies, and owning money will inevitably converge to be interchangeable. Energy, computation power, and wealth will boil down to be just another manifestation of value itself. And with that, the impact that cryptocurrencies will have on the fabric of society will be simultaneously change everything and nothing at once. We once demanded gold, we settled for gold-backed money (which were just government promises of gold), then non-gold backed money, and now entirely non-backed money... and soon we will see value as nothing but data itself. 51% computing power, 51% money, 51% whatever. Now, he's a very smart guy that had been drinking, and I was a much dumber guy that was also drinking, so I highly doubt I have captured the above too accurately. But going forward, that has been my interpretation of all forms of this topic.
If you read through my writing, you'll see why my personal biases align the way I see this. I view derivatives as being translatable to the underlying asset (with some discount/premium owed to uncertainty), which is why I take so strongly to the view that owning assets = computing power = money, as they are all just value itself. I see no difference between owning 51% shares of a company and having the power to take control and having the support of 51% of voteholders by proxy willing to back your activist plays. And, as technically inaccurate and inelegant as it may be, I draw that translation directly back to cryptos as well. Buterin told me that the biggest threat to a network would be someone who simply had the wallet to bankroll a takeover. That a network can fight a computing hash attack because everyone in that network will be willing to increase their individual hash contribution to fend off a hostile takeover and protect their own interests. Just like shareholders can fight off an activist that owns a 10% stake and wants to take a seat on the board of directors of a company. But none of us can fight if someone can simply bankroll 51% and deploy that capital (or resources as it was called) to buy that authentication power full stop.
Where I simply disagreed was that no one in their right minds would want to put up that kind of capital. Buying up every share of Apple gives you 100% ownership of a fully functional, profitable and living entity. Buying up every modicum of a cryptocurrency gives you nothing. And no one is going to throw up billions for a strong-form 51% attack and risk ending up in that very situation. So you can try and hash your way into it, but even with Bitcoin (which I have said so many "infant" remarks about) the resilience of the network is probably infinitely strong such that you will not accomplish any of it without having billions to bully it into submission.
In summary, I wouldn't take it too literally or technically and keep it at "can a vulture fund deploy a certain amount of capital to assert full control and ownership of a larger structure" and for that you need those billions. The technical details (like what a long-term hash rate is (as the number of coins mined is in a mature state of indefinitely approaching the asymptotic limit) and its energy cost relative to the value of the underlying cryptocurrency network, from which you would calculate the economic threshold for pulling off that kind of attack) is not relevant to the general concept and discussion on whether or not this type of threat is likely to be the reason that cryptos fail.
I am really enjoying these talks. Much better than most discussions on the topic in 2018.

This is a great way of looking at it. If you don't look at it as an investment but rather a vote of confidence, then you can rest easy knowing that you're putting out a certain amount of money to make a statement rather than with the expectation of personal gains.
Of course, this means you apply a very different set of principles than the framework you would use for a real investment seeking returns rather than to make your voice heard.
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:10:36
Good points. Let me elaborate:
1) The full scope and potential depth of blockchain is something that I think very few grasp - you could be an engineer exploring one application with Rubix Deloitte and still be totally oblivious to the frontier of innovation on another front. So you are correct - my understanding of blockchain (and pretty much everyone who does not actively work on blockchain related projects) is likely to be impaired. Nonetheless...
The potential of blockchain is largely something I see in supply chain management. For example, this will allow full and complete transparency of the composition of every single product, percolating all the way through to every individual raw material component and where it was sourced. The carbon emission from the specific oilfield from which the hydrocarbons that was used to manufacture ethylene were generated, the electric cost of that went into processing industrial steel components, and the specific labour (child labour in Bangladesh) that contributed all the way to the most minute detail... soon you'll be able to look at a finished product like a car and instantly count every single detail down to the location of every sourced raw material and you can instantly track every individual item back to its very source. The implications on corporate responsibility and financial transparency are staggering. I can only imagine that people will one day look at how "handwavy" financial decomposition is today with zero blockchain tracking of every molecule of every finished good the same way we try to imagine how it was possible that a fully modernized and sophisticated capital markets existed 50 years ago when nobody had MS Excel and you built portfolios and trading positions (and modelled entire companies!) with ink and paper.
By comparison, cryptocurrency is a very specific, very niche, and very narrow implementation of blockchain technology. It requires a very specific set of circumstances to evolve, gain traction, and prosper. It's hard for me (and I would argue anyone) to have a strong degree of confidence that all those conditions align.
That's what I meant by my relatively strong confidence in blockchain relative to the specific application in Bitcoin.
**Late edit  to make wording more clear re: poster below.**
**I don't see 51% attack as actually being a credible threat to any crypto. Even in the 2012-2016 days I recalled concerns regarding Mt. Gox or some other collective of holdings dangerously approaching 50 but in that case the industry will generally self-police itself and work against that threat themselves well before it can happen. Individuals will be extremely vigilant to protect their investments. You can see that action happening within this very community as it self-polices various areas.**
**A strong-form 51% attack that involves buying up 51% of the currency to manipulate it also doesn't make sense economically. The moment market participants realize that 51% of the market is colluding to defraud the 49% there will be an immediate flight of capital and whoever bought up 51% of a currency will be left with 100% of useless currency. At fledgling sizes ($1B market cap) you have much better investment opportunities. At 2018 BTC sizes (~$150B market cap) the size becomes borderline uneconomical and the risk of torpedoing the very asset you just bought 51% of is way too high. A cool "scary" concept but I never took the concept of 51% attack to be a reason why cryptos would fail. Eroding the integrity and risking a confidence collapse of a currency that you just bought 51% of doesn't make any sense to me, and I can't see anyone with billions gambling on that strategy.**
2) I agree that generally in various local regions, the appeal of a crypto can be great, especially since it is decentralized and derisked (the local government cannot tamper with money supply for monetary policy). However, this comes down to a macro debate and would require you to do the math on a case-by-case basis. Generally in this situation a flight to capital results in uncontrollable inflation as local currency is desperately sold in exchange for any other store of value. It is going to come down to the numbers and how they add up, because you need to juxtapose local capital flight causing a massive oversupply of local currency to your crypto and compare how much demand there is for a dying currency - would you sell your BTC for a Zimbabwe note? Most people hold crypto as a proxy for something like gold - so how does the supply/demand balance for the tremendous amount of desperate capital flight? I don't have these answers and you would have to run them on a case-by-case basis, but you'll see that the complications add up rapidly.
Not to say that it doesn't work or it isn't viable - the question is, in that situation, how reliable will the local financial structure be? If the Zimbabwe currency is rapidly imploding and the national financial system is falling apart, how reliable can the local crypto infrastructure be? And I don't mean the actual network - I mean literally who are you going to talk to to transact your wildly inflating currency to physically do a transaction? Unregulated, unsupported and not backed by the local central banking bodies, I can't imagine the infrastructure to access cryptos in such a country could be that reliable... the bankers themselves will be busy trying to get on a lifeboat.
So what is the comparative advantage that cryptos would have in this particular case? If you are able to exchange a dying currency for any foreign store of value (e.g. gold) then you are able to do so directly to USD. This seems much safer - in fact this is what people did in Cuba. USD basically just took over because 1 USD buys 1 USD worth of goods no matter what, it always held its value, and locals simply began transacting those instead.
So the pecking order falls down into USD &gt; Gold &gt; Cryptos for a myriad of reasons - at least at face value. There's discussions around an authoritarian government, maybe that cryptos can assist with, but in that situation, I think you have more pressing problems (government intervention on commerce), and the less liquid crypto market (relative to USD and gold) would be even harder to convince someone to take your troubled money in exchange for their comparatively stable virtual assets.
All in all I think it can work, so it is a fair point. But why would you opt for it when you can have a capital flight straight to the USD (which is basically what these individuals want to hold) and even if you preferred cryptos, would the local infrastructure be there? These questions need to be answered before I could upgrade my view of cryptocurrencies to something that is "definitely" going to take its position as a mainline asset class.
(By comparison, blockchain tech is almost definitely going to start showing up and will probably become a cornerstone in various industries and definite financial markets)

Well let's be careful now because decentralized audit has a cost. A pretty hefty cost. I'd like to know how many rivers were polluted and how many child slaves were involved in the making of my sneakers - but I don't want to pay for every modicum of that data for the millions of products, foods and clothing that I buy. I will be satisfied with the assurance that if someone is caught falsifying this data, they will be imprisoned.
Same with corporate fraud and financial accounting. Just having more transparency is good enough. It's already a massive step up from not having it at all. Companies that have superior transparency will have a competitive edge, and they will pay to make this data reasonably trustworthy. I see the Big 4 audit firms doing this very type of thing.
We'll save transaction cost of true distributed ledgering for things we need absolute 100% flawless accuracy. Everything else we'll be excited just to get "good enough." And **yes** it is just a glorified database. But it's a very elegant approach towards solving a logistical challenge with technology. It's an itty bitty step, but that's why it will be so easy to make it happen. And the world changes dramatically with incremental improvements just like this.

Absolutely. I actually studied cryptos intensely circa ~2011 because I wanted to understand it as an investment opportunity in much greater depth and earlier than anyone else. I dusted out some very old C++ textbooks to relearn over half a year and took a 2 week bootcamp to design my own crypto. I called it "LambShard" because I remember feeling very proud that I was going that far above and beyond the rest of the street to really dig in, and feeling like absolute shit because I realized nothing I was doing in that room was remotely unique and I was just another sheep in that same room, seeing the same things and also easily the worst coder in the room.
I had the privilege of sitting down with Vitalik Buterin recently and trust me when I say I definitely agree with you when you say this space has some brilliant goddamn minds. And trust me when I say that where I allocate capital for investment purposes often is not perfectly correlated to my respect for the entity or people that run it. A company that makes paper mail envelopes (shit future) run by someone uses a brick phone and thinks technology is a fad (shit leader) but generates $200MM in free cash flow every year is still something I am going to be more than happy to buy for $500MM.
And to put it the other way, and don't take this personally, but there's lots of other burgeoning incredible disruptive fledgling industries that also have absolutely brilliant leaders and innovators pioneering potentially humanity-changing opportunities for whom I have tremendous respect for. Thorium reactors, green tech, CRISPR gene coding labs. But investing isn't about whether or not you like the story - it's about whether or not the numbers make sense. And as impressive and unique as cryptos are, it is just another one of many other stories that all are vying for attention and capital. The only difference is that you don't hear the frustration from these areas because they don't get the attention of masses of retail investors dreaming of becoming rich - and thus they get no media coverage.
But those guys could solve the entire energy puzzle for all of humanity. Or the mortality puzzle. Or the "are we trapped in the Milky Way" puzzle. And cryptos, when you line it up with everything else, is just another typical "exciting" story, and a story alone might be good enough for the retail investor watching Mad Money, but it isn't good enough for me.
To a hodl'r, the definition of a good investment is something that they can imagine making them rich. And this is a very low bar to set because you could buy a lottery ticket and fulfill that requirement (which is incidentally why lottery tickets are such a profitable business)
To an investor, the definition of a good investment is something that is superior to all other opportunities available.

This is correct. Banks aren't a thing that happened and intruded onto society - they formed as a result of natural needs for capital and value allocation. Same way we elected sheriffs to look after our villages and it evolved into the modern day FBI/CIA enforcement agencies today. These institutions are manifestations of what society has sought and will generally desire for fundamental needs.

One thing I find interesting is that this Reddit community is the very platform where you can witness financial regulation and watchdog behaviors evolve and take place. There are a lot of jokes and general negative sentiment toward central banks and the fed, but in many ways you can see that you yourselves are becoming what the current regulators do today.
Before long the representatives that advocate for your interests and execute petitions and lawsuits will form the very institutions that enforce rules and act as governing bodies for any new financial paradigm that may arise from cryptos. If anything it is a great environment to explore and re-observe how a financial system actually is formed - and perhaps dissidents unhappy with you/us in this system will in the future then seek alternatives to replace the new status quo yet again!

Evolution occurred gradually, and your hyperbole would only make sense for peoples that were geographically separated for millennia then reintroduced. False dichotomy regardless because we have seen you coming a mile away. And don't look at it as "us vs them" - lots of us are actually rooting for you. Better tech means more efficient systems means less money spent on back office and logistics and more money to dedicate towards capital allocation.
Any reasonable investor meanders because you consider and weigh out every possible outcome. False prophets and zealots are the ones that decide something is gospel and don't think to doubt themselves. The smartest people you will ever meet are the ones that are constantly seeking flaws in their thinking and cross-examining their own claims against those with different views.

@ Gold concept: Generally gold doesn't get traded in physical form. Ownership of gold is certed and sometimes you'll just have a 3rd party brokerage manage your "claim" to X amount of gold. Basically the same way you never touch most of your salary as it gets paid to you then you pay it for your car, house, etc. It's all virtualized and usually managed by a third party.
So as long as you can convert your currency into something, you can hop around from any currency to any asset class pretty quickly. So the real physical difference between these things isn't really physical at all, since most likely it will always be virtual digitized. In that sense, it's not as different as you might imagine.
If you have a hostile government that is imposing controls I don't know if Bitcoin will help. There's an analog gap between how you convert a basket of oranges into local currency into Bitcoin - you still need a local banking portal to connect to international markets, people on the other side willing to buy your currency, and a way for them to get value out of it (ergo international commerce and trade). Otherwise it's no different to a collecting bottle caps and citizens unanimously declaring it the "People's" currency. Without access to international trade it won't mean anything. If an authoritative government can shut down access to foreign markets, you're going to have problems transacting internationally regardless of the platform.
Look at virtualized currencies and money laundering done through online outlets e.g. online casinos, MMORPGs, etc. where criminals are shooting virtualized assets across 20 countries. You can run that stuff through 50 VPNs, then do another 50 things with it, but a determined government will still find ways to shut it down.
 well the same way we guarantee CEOs never lie about earnings and financial reports. You don't really. But it provides additional layers which generally covers anything that isn't an extreme fringe case. And we're not talking MegaEvil LLC; imagine Reebok vs Nike vs Adidas in a world where one company can literally trace through the entire trail their shoe came from. Sure they can defraud at various parts, the point is that there's more evidence to audit and analyze. Same way that more stringent accounting standards don't stop people from falsifying data, but in 99.9% cases it just gives more transparency and accountability.
Leaps and bounds. Blockchain is fantastic because it's a very technologically elegant solution that will enable easy proliferation of higher standards in the business world. And no it's not earthshattering but in the real world, incremental steps make big differences.
@ 51% - I think I know what you are referring to, but you should just call out the argument directly (and as I wrote, you shouldn't even take anything written online as pseudo-advice... you should take my words as nothing more than just an opinion).
Let me clarify. There are two 51% categories that I see. Weak-form, which is what I would call the Mt. Gox / currency wallet / money management event, where someone who handles currency owned by others could manipulate them because they are a central platform, and strong-form, which is someone literally buying 51% of a crypto to manipulate it.
Weak-form never struck me as a concern because a community is far too aware and self-policing to let that happen. People will act in their own interest to ensure that they do not relinquish enough power to a third party that they could compromise the integrity of their investments by proxy.
Strong-form is the only credible threat to a crypto, but as I explained above the economics of it doesn't make sense.
Weak-form could be done with a few million USD if you were able to get everyone on your platform. Strong-form requires you to actually put up billions of dollars. However, weak-form will naturally be self-policed away, while strong-form there is nothing a community can do to actively block an attack. However, the cost of a strong-form attack is far too high and the risk of instantly losing billions on your investment is far too great.
Thusly any possible form of 51% attack seems very unlikely to be the reason cryptos (or any specific crypto of a notable size) would fail. The challenges for cryptos lie in positive features lining up, not a single disaster negative hole in the concept.
