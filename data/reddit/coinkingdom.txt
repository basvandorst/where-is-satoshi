Do you honestly think that Shrem is some kind of hero? I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

Yet you haven't corrected my apparently false assumptions. Pathetic.

Did anybody even read the actual criminal complaint? 
He was a public figure who should have expected some extra scrutiny thus having a huge incentive to do everything by the book. Instead, Shrem knowingly broke the law by trading with a silk road vendor, going against the good judgement of his own CEO. 
The guy is a greedy dumb-ass and Bitcoin would be much better off without the likes of him involved. I would stay well away from anything he does in the future.

Basically, you drew parallels between the criminal acts of Charlie Shrem and the movement to end slavery. 
History has judged the abolitionists to be heroes so I took your comment to mean that you see Shrem as a abolitionist-level heroic figure who was fighting the good fight to end injustice. 
Now, if you [read the criminal complaint]( you will see that there was nothing heroic about Shrems actions. You might even find yourself looking down on him as he makes one stupid decision after another, logging it all to his email inbox.
At first, it's kind of funny to think that you see Shrem in that light, but it becomes depressing when you realise just how many bettercoins there are in this world. 
Do you see the relevance now, little buddy? Let me know if you need any more help.
