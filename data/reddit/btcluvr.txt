technological devices are cheaper because of technological progress and mass production. without central bankers and their printing presses, they would probably be even cheaper - no inflation would exist. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:55:51
no. better alternative is to use offline dedicated PCs and well-reviewed open source programs as much as possible. 
and you're not even trying. just one example was completely trusting STM and their HWRNG to do entropy for both seed and ECDSA. who knows how exactly they did their RNG? besides their own specs you can't review that at all. if it's somehow predictable then whole Ledger security is compromised.

i think you're raising valid concerns, most of it were addressed, let me show one more - it's inflation. currencies are prone to inflation, central banks are basically robbing you blind. if you think that 1 US dollar was equivalent to 1 JP Yen which was equal to 1.5 grams of pure gold in 1900s, you'll see where this is getting.

"The Shanghai branch of Chartered bank began operation in August 1858. Initially, the bank's business dealt specifically with large volume discounting and re-discounting of opium and cotton bills. Although there was a gradual rise in opium cultivation in China, the imports of opium still increased from 50,087 picul in 1863 to 82,61 picul by 1888. Transactions in the opium trade generated substantial profits for Chartered bank."

First U.S. Bitcoin Exchange Set to Open
Coinbase Has Backing From the NYSE, Banks and Venture Capitalists
By GREG BENSINGER
Jan. 25, 2015 4:34 p.m. ET
The virtual currency bitcoin is getting a very real boost on Monday, with the opening of the first licensed U.S. exchange.
Coinbase Inc., a startup backed by $106 million from the New York Stock Exchange, banks and venture-capital firms, said its exchange will offer greater security for individuals and institutions to trade bitcoin and monitor real-time pricing of the cryptocurrency.
The exchange could bring needed legitimacy to the currency, which isn’t backed by a central government and is traded over virtual exchanges, primarily overseas. Coinbase said it has insurance, offering traders some assurance that their money won’t disappear.
Bitcoin enthusiasts have been buffeted by the collapse of Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox last year—taking with it around half a billion dollars of investors’ money—and a security breach earlier this month at Slovenia-based exchange Bitstamp. The value of a bitcoin itself, determined by trading on existing exchanges, has fallen to about $240, from a peak in late 2013 of more than $1,200.
“To have an organized exchange that has the backing of thoughtful venture capitalists and investors addresses one of the main problems with bitcoin: its extreme volatility,” said Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke University finance professor who has studied cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin has been sorely in need of something like this.”
Coinbase’s founders say they have been working for five months to win licenses from state financial regulators. They have regulatory approval in half of U.S. states, including large population centers like New York and California. For now, Coinbase can do business with account holders only in states where it has approval.
Coinbase will take a small percentage—likely less than 1%—of most transactions, said Fred Ehrsam, 26 years old, a co-founder. The exchange will initially be limited to users in the U.S., but Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, 32, said he plans to expand overseas.
Mr. Armstrong said he expected to attract both individuals and businesses looking to trade bitcoin. “Our goal is to become the world’s largest exchange,” he said.
Others are looking to open U.S.-based bitcoin exchanges, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twin brothers known for their early feuds with Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg .
Financial regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been scrutinizing bitcoin recently. Benjamin Lawsky , the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, is working on a so-called BitLicense for firms looking to offer digital-currency services in the state; Coinbase is operating under earlier regulations. Mr. Lawsky’s plan is seen as a template for legislation in other jurisdictions, and it may give outsiders more confidence in the currency.
Bitcoins are created using high-powered computers that “mine” for the currency by solving complex mathematical equations. They are exchanged digitally either for currency, or goods and services. Ownership and transactions are recorded, anonymously, in a so-called blockchain, which backers say reduces the risk of fraud.
Bitcoin grew to prominence in recent years in part because of the ease with which it can be transferred.
Coindesk, which tracks the price of bitcoins, says 82,000 businesses accept the currency, double that of a year earlier, including e-commerce site Overstock.com Inc. and Expedia Inc., as well as many small retailers. The value of all bitcoin is $3.2 billion, according to Coindesk’s price index.
The NYSE invested in Coinbase during a $75 million round of fundraising that closed this month. Other investors include USAA Bank, the venture arm of Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters Corp. CEO Tom Glocer. Venture backers include Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.
The NYSE’s investment was intended in part to “keep an eye on bitcoin as it matures as a legitimate currency,” President Tom Farley said. “Any currency relies on its acceptance.” The Coinbase exchange “is an important step for the currency to become socially acceptable.”
Coinbase counts about 2.2 million consumer wallets and nearly 40,000 merchants that use its services. The company has about 75 employees and plans to operate in 30 countries by year-end, up from 19 today.

USD/EUR/GBP give people some protection, while many developing nations suffer devaluations of their national currencies. in Ukraine and Russia it's obvious: if you're holding hryvnias or rubles, you're getting poorer every day. that's why many choose to hedge in USD/EUR. it's very common here to keep rainy day money this way. for developed countries with their stronger currencies it's not so evident, but in the long run, we're all in the same boat.

the downside of land is it's portability. it can be taxed to death or just plummet in value with the rest of economy. government can seize it. anything can happen and you'll only be protected by a piece of paper with deed record and good will of the rest of society. it may just not work in failing economy. gold is also kind of hard to move cross-border in the modern world. but of course you can at least do something, with land it's just impossible.

it seems most of them only know trezor, tesla, lambo, a lottery and a lawyer. 
forget all this BS. reality is, can you trust your wife? and would she be able to handle it? how good is she with her personal finance? will she keep a secret? is she a greedy average bitch or an intelligent person? your question boils down to your wife's character, not really lawyers, lambos or keeping private keys somewhere. 
think of personal issues prior to taking any actions. it's hard to value personality, you'd have to work on your own. a lawyer, a trezor, wallet splitting are not taking decisions for you, only getting you some, rather illusory in this case, kind of protection. if you end up going at legal war with your own wife, it's better (and cheaper) not to tell her at all.

less sophisticated of us are upvoting all halving news, in hope that it would propel the price.
let's do some fact checking.
upon halving, inflation rate will be down 1.80% per annum.  1.80% / 365 = 0.00493150685% per day.
that's how much we will be pushed up every day by adjusted inflation rate.
if we take bitcoin volatility index, it's 60 day average is 2.05252%.
i come to conclusion that halving impact is tiny given usual daily price movements.

i don't get why so many people believe there's something bad about it.
doesn't binance or many other exchanges allow the same?

or alternatively, go all in, long bitcoin, make the price rise and liquidate my short.

even apple's OS X is significantly better than windows, it's BSD based and has a proper security model in place. trying to secure windows is always a disaster, unless you're taking it completely offline. avoid like a plague when dealing with something privacy sensitive. if you learn "computer stuff" you'll get to know why.

to me, it's more of a blip on a radar. i'm kind of certain that crypto will have much more traction in coming 5 years than it had in previous 10. lots of marketing, inflation pressure and demographics change will get us there. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:00:21
even if there are 10 million people with $1k in bitcoin, this is a drop in a bucket and we're still very, very early on.
@_date: 2019-12-18 08:30:15
just fyi: first miners were mining just for fun, for maybe a whole year or two. noone considered this to be a get rich quick scheme. nevertheless bitcoin survived. even now complete shitcoins are still being mined.
bitcoin is risky, but the cost of mining is not one of the risks.

i personally tend to think of btc-e as more of a speculative exchange. bitstamp is where the "real" exchange going. folks at btc-e are trying to make a quick buck with their metatrader setups. or so it seems. so, i read it as speculators thinking we're going upwards. interesting. of course these are only my assumptions. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:50:29
above reasons. mostly because of it's size. payment processing is the area which hasn't gone through much change in past 10-20 years. companies are well established, innovation is usually minor, so if any of them is picking up bitcoin, that sure is a sign of increased adoption.

that 305% increase in LN is likely a single entity, not a real world usage. LN is still doing it's baby steps. 
price action is hard to argue, but i tend to think that this is some kind of advanced bot on bitfinex manipulating the price. if you watch price action there and see the rest follow, you'll likely agree with me. it got us to 19k and it's dragging us to 3k and perhaps lower. 
given all that, ideas behind btc are still sound.

the whole issue is more complex than removing link. all you did is just bring shit to the table.
it has started with close to state Vedomosti article. paywalled and in Russian, quoting RU CB letter that banks with indirect connection to Visa would have to use backup partners and probably about to suffer certain outages. the letter confirmed by 5 market participants. link: [
the rest of Russian media brought more rumors and nothing official. then Ukrainian media added up, bringing even more of their fantasies. OP linked the article from them. the resulting discussion is just shit, as you rightly mentioned.
it is true though that Russian officials are digging into alternatives because of possible sanctions, on many levels, not just crypto.
