Facts are subjective. Whole trading concept is subjective. Change this chart to XBTUSD you get a different picture. Change the candle times, you get a whole different picture.
Sure thing there is a repetitive cycle, that's what humans do. We repeat things but that doesn't mean that "boom/bust cycle" means something.

That's probably why it happened. Hate to write sentences starts with "would, should, could" but...
You supposed to secure your Gmail with a 2FA too.
Otherwise, even if you would have entered to a phishing website, he couldn't enter your account becuase Bittrex requires email verification if you open your account from a different ip.
On the other side if you are using Windows, your pc might have been infected. The hacker might have been watching your moves all day along and he might have waited for the right moment.

If they wouldn't have decided to pay off to creditors based on $400/BTC rate, none of this would happen. Creditors supposed to receive the amount of Bitcoin they had. Since this totally logical scenario is way off the table, shit is getting messier everyday.
One thing I don't understand is why trustee is not selling off via OTC?
Second thing, trustee will pay off the creditors, shit load of bitcoin will be left to owners and they will re-distribute among creditors again, what a shitty, time-wasting way to deal with the problem.

* On or around February 20th 2016 Adam Back, many miners, Bitcoin Core developers and some China based businesses, which at the time handled some 90% of trading volumes,  agreed in a closed door meeting with no journalists present to, among other things:
*Run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core,” and to “only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production.*
They said. How true is that?
Is Adam really made a deal similar to NYA in his or blockstream's favor?

Who the hell is bullshitting that "%90" part? Bizcoin cocksuckers only got the %48-%49 of the hashpower.
You really believe that all their hashpower will shift to that shitcoin instantly? They can't and won't do that unless they secure themselves.
Why dat boi Jihan still not mining Bcash? Because he would lose hell of a money if he would have pointed all the machines to there. He can't and won't do that.
Same thing goes for this scenario. Bitch ass Garzik and Doofus Silbert trying to confuse innocent bystanders but that's fine. Decentralized Bitcoin will be the Original Bitcoin. Hashpower will not shift **UNLESS** it becomes more profitable than Bitcoin.
Bitch ass Voorhees scared because atomic swaps literally will leave Shapeshit out of business.
"Yours" will be dead when the Lightning Network comes.
Atomic Swaps and LN will change many things and that's not good for their business. So why the fuck would they support our side? Agreement to my ass. Voorhees goes on a comment tour on to convince people. Both side is just wasting their time. Especially the ones who wrote "open letters" to Voorhees. 
And that Fucking Jihan. He makes 9 figures annually without moving his fingers. He is known and popular and makes money because of Bitcoin yet this fucker betrays Bitcoin and shoots his own foot.

1. Opposition holds about %42-%48 of the hashrate. Yet that topic is open to discuss because there might be a war over hashrate.
2. Major who? Trading happens on off-chain. Yet the only thing that matters is the withdraws and deposits. DCG might have an own the Coinbase and Kraken but most of the exchange activity happens at Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bitmex, Poloniex, HitBtc, Bitstamp and Gemini.
Now, let's review;
**Bitfinex**; CSO and CEO are the ones who gives the call. I think they will be on our side. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
**Bittrex**; I don't think they have ties with DCG and Rami, Richie, Julian and the others probably will make the right decision. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
**Bitmex;** 
**Poloniex;** Not sure about them.
**HitBtc;** Who knows.
**Bitstamp** and **Gemini** are shady players.
Exchange owners have a chat room where they talk and make important decisions together. So most likely they will be monitoring the situation very closely with their team and other exchange founders. That means, they might move to a chain that will secure their customers fund.
Literally something like this might happen in november, lol; 
3.Users are never powerless. There are users who know stuff and there are users who known as "innocent bystanders".
4.Some of them said they will keep supporting the decentralized chain.
I would like to end my comment with a three quotes from a beautiful movie;

My Dear Friend,
If we have managed to come this far as a community, I'm sure we can defeat our next opponent. After we defeat Shillbert and his corporate army, many powerful opponents(such as Central Banks and Goverments) will come after us.
That is good for us. If there is a chaos, Bitcoin will benefit from it.

1. There is not one blockchain out there. For each coin; A; either you can fork Bitcoin and create your own version. B; You can build a blockchain totally independent from others.
2. Based on the coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/ data; There is 1150 coin but of course probably the number is much more because coinmarketcap only lists coin if you submit to them.
Hope it helps :)
