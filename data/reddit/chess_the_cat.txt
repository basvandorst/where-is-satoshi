A dying company?  WTF?  A trillion dollar market cap and $250 billion IN CASH?  Uh. Sure. “Dying.”

Your friend sounds like a complete moron otherwise how do the millions of people without Bitcoin manage?

I literally google it like 10 times a day to see how much it's dropped. Honestly. I'm addicted.

Email is easy to understand. It’s electronic mail. Why do I need Bitcoin?  I can already send actual money over the Internet. Bitcoin is the equivalent of Itchy and Scratchy dollars. I don’t get why I need to convert perfectly good cash into Bitcoin. Because it’s more fun?  Or should I mine my own and destroy the environment?  Just like real mining. Lol.

I wish I could put my life savings against that bet. In 3-5 years Bitcoin will be on the scrap heap of history; another idea that went nowhere. 
If it went to $250,000 then all coins would be worth $5,250,000,000,000. Where is that wealth coming from?  Thin air?

But if you had a modem and a dialer you would absolutely understand this. You’d be looking for it. When you set up the dialer you’d be asked for these settings. These instructions are very clear and precise. 
Tell me, in the same number of words, how to send you $100 by Bitcoin from scratch and I’ll consider your argument.

The US government is backed by the power to levy taxes and the might of the US military. They can literally take everything you or anyone on earth owns by force. That's a pretty good guarantee that a buck has value.

If it’s hacked you don’t get to sell all your Bitcoins at today’s prices. The minute it’s hacked Bitcoin loses all value.

Pretty sure that would be real estate.
