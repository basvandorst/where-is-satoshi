Huh, that's a mangled commit date (seems to be around the date from the 0.14.0rc1 tagging). The parent commit (c2704ec98a1b7b35b6a7c1b6b26a3f16d44e8880) is from Mon Aug 14 17:19:14 2017

I've also thought about this. That's currently the case with the alpha-stage software, but can improve in the long run. The private keys don't need to be available all of the time, and if they are used it is only for the purpose of opening/closing channels. A HSM might help there.

Most of the release notes have been written, but there are some things that could be expanded or some minor changes added.

EVEN fixing spelling mistakes. Yes, imagine!
The attention to detail, QA, and continued improvement of the codebase is what sets bitcoin core apart from pretty much all alt crypto-currency projects, certainly from forks of the same codebase.
A gentle reminder that some forks fail to even get off the ground due to off-by-one errors and other sloppiness.

That would be nice. However from a wallet developer viewpoint BIP70 is annoying. It pulls in lot of dependencies which are not normally necessary for a bitcoin wallet, e.g. on integrating a http client, Google protobuf, TLS, certificate handling. This all for relatively little benefit compared to simple bitcoin: URIs.
Some were toying with the idea of deprecating BIP70, before Bitpay announced to use exclusively.
Tangentially I expect no one is rushing to implement BIP70 right now, with lightning around the corner, which is its own payment protocol and solves many more problems.

You don't need a round number as base. If you have a number 'abc.de' (where a-e are digits, and . is the decimal point) in base π you can compute the resulting value from base-π to decimal:
    N = ... + aπ^2 + bπ^1 + cπ^0 + dπ^-1 + eπ^-2 + ...
For example 10 in base Pi is 3.1415... in decimal.
This also works the other way around, you can make approximations of decimal numbers in base PI. For example the number 8 in base Pi would be 21.2021120021.... (never ending sequence). 
See how useful and more understandable this would make Bitcoin to the average user?

Obviously you're trusting the software that you're downloading. However with open source there is less trust involved than with closed source. There is no closed group of developers, everyone can propose, monitor and review changes.
Also there are multiple implementations and many versions being used on the network, so one single implementation/version being compromised is survivable.

I don't remember any of the core devs making any strong political statements at all. Or Satoshi for that matter. Sure, he aired some frustration with the current financial system, like nearly everyone at that time. But he didn't say anything that might label him as some extreme libertarian or anarchist.
It was sufficiently attractive to people of certain ideologies that they acted as initial adopters and pioneers. The 'rebellious' image allowed it to grow. Now it has outgrown that group by far. It shouldn't affect decisions about bitcoin-the-platform, try to look through it or you'll miss a technological leap because of prejudice.

No. It depends on the number of orphans received, among other things that happen along the way.
But it may not even be a problem anymore, 0.9.0 limits the number of orphan blocks stored as well as is somewhat more conservative with memory use in general.
Only time (and testing) will tell. If you want to be on the safe side, use a 64-bit version, it will also be faster with verification.

I love complexity for complexity's sake sometimes and as an experiment I can appreciate Ethereum. It reminds me a bit of core wars but with financial instruments.
But as a Bitcoin developer I also know that it is difficult enough to understand Bitcoin and all the implications of its design. Even one of the largest exchanges made a rookie mistake! I'd say let's try to master this beast first, before adding even more complexity.
(another argument heard against Ethereum is that it is moving in the wrong way; the point of transactions is to provide a proof/transcript of execution of a script, not a script itself to be executed on all nodes. Zerocash is moving in this direction with their usage of zkSNARK)

Switching to replicant should get rid of the 'backdoor'.
Though in principle it isn't a remote backdoor in itself. It allows the modem firmware to access files, but one first has to gain access to the modem firmware (ie through a network exploit or backdoor) to be able to use it. In which case you're already screwed.
At least the Samsung phones *have* a controlled IPC-based separation between the main CPU and the baseband. In many other phones it's possible to DMA directly all around the place from the baseband, reading and overwriting memory without even necessitating a backdoor.

This is just a visual problem. Some nodes are lying about their starting height, and you somehow connected to a few nodes that do that. Your node is up to date fine. You can check that by comparing your block number against other sources.
In 0.10 a different mechanism will be used to determine synced-ness (already merged in master) which doesn't suffer from this.

You should regard addresses as one-time identifiers for a payment, not as stable identifier over multiple transactions (unlike an IP address).
Whatever will take the place of the IP in bitcoin will not be the current addresses. Proposals like the "stealth addresses" would work better here and could be bound to a name.

0.9.1 includes a bitcoind.static which is fully statically linked. This should work on any possible linux distro. That is mentioned in the release notes.

@_date: 2014-03-17 07:59:05
The peers that you are connected to while broadcasting the transaction can see your IP. They could correlate timestamps and addresses to find out where certain private keys are located. This could be used to stage a hacking attack, for example.
So it's very simple: if you want to avoid leaking your IP, use Tor.

You could say that widespread adoption is a bad idea unless these kind of misconceptions are out of the way.

What does that have to do with anything? The core developers got a free lifetime membership.
But you can be assured that we don't check whether someone is member of the BF when reviewing contributions to the code.
Also git is a distributed version control system, it's easy enough to click the fork button on github and make your own changes, git doesn't care whether you are a BF member either.
Edit: and development discussion also doesn't happen on the BF forums, but on IRC and the mailing list and github itself, all open to everyone.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:41:03
It is *being* addressed for a long time. It is not possible to remove the malleability in one go because there will be software out there that generates transactions what will be invalid according to the new measures (which will become unusable). 
So it has to be done step by step. One of those steps was taken in 0.8.0, and sipa is working on new rules that would make malleability even less.
The solution for mtgox would be to use another measure apart from txid hash to check whether transactions went through.
@_date: 2014-01-28 11:02:15
Correct. Unless he resigns he'll always be head developer of the bitcoin/bitcoin project on github which is the main repository for the reference client (note: not Bitcoin but the Bitcoin reference client).
He's comparable to Linus Torvalds for Linux or Guido van Rossum for Python.
@_date: 2014-01-15 10:44:31
Yes, as long as one keeps the wallet encrypted and doesn't share it publicly it should be OK-ish to put it on dropbox. You're only exposing your balance and public keys in that case. Not something you likely want out in the wild, but not a disaster if a few dropbox employees have access.
@_date: 2014-06-14 09:18:26
If everything that was a good idea was integrated into the protocol as well as bitcoind it'd become an unmaintainable mess. Better to modularize and have specific tools for specific purposes, maintained by those that deeply care about the specific issue.
That said, making P2Pool more user-friendly is a worthwhile goal.
@_date: 2014-01-29 10:51:13
Why x86 specifically? Isn't that choosing the side of Intel? Is that also a form of centralization?
Will they care about an x86-specific mining algorithm in 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? Does this mean x86 architecture has to be kept alive forever just for efficient bitcoin mining? Will large-scale x86 chips be 'special mining hardware' by then?
What does 'x86 architecture' even mean for performance as yesterdays x86 is very different from today's. The surface level assembly is still the same, but the microcode and entire chip has been redesigned many times resulting in different performance properties, different optimization tricks, and so on.
See also my other post here, color me skeptic but I don't think switching to another PoW will solve any problems with centralization. At least in the longer run.
Or would it be the idea to update the PoW every few years, switching every time some party reaches a critical percentage of the network?
@_date: 2014-01-24 12:11:55
The slow speed of change is almost entirely due to a lack of developers, testers and reviewers for the reference client project.
And keep in mind that it's almost impossible to experiment when there's a world-wide economy at stake.
A blue-sky project such as ethereum could prove or disprove that this the right way forward and affect the decision to build something similar into Bitcoin (which would require a hard-fork).

It usually means that there is a conflict between the transaction that your wallet just generated and the memory pool / transactions in blocks. This can be caused by the issue raised by the OP.
It can be avoided by providing a higher minconf value (2 or higher, 6 recommended) to the send* commands so that it will not pick unconfirmed change outputs, or by applying one of the patches.
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:02:03
It was already possible to store data in the block chain. For fact, many things are already in there.
The only reason that OP_RETURN is introduced is to give a less harmful way to include data that can be pruned from the UTXO set (so doesn't require memory forever).
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:05:28
Do you think that anyone thinks otherwise?
Transaction malleability is an issue, it is being solved, and was already being solved before mtgox escalated things. It's not exactly a new issue either.

As many as possible. The more independent verifiers the safer. Any developer can build the binaries deterministically through a system called gitian, and upload the GPG signatures of the result to a github repository. I'd recommend joining in.

It's very difficult to think of a funding model for bitcoin wallets. It's not like you can just slap on adware/spyware like with other 'free'ware.
Selling the software would be possible, although people could easily work around that with it being open source. Close the source and no one will trust you anymore.
So adding a fee per transaction makes sense in a way.

That doesn't mean that any use of goto introduces bugs. There are a lot of very arbitrary rules for 'safety critical C code' used within companies.

@_date: 2014-02-24 16:01:39
I used to agree with you, but my experience has shown otherwise.
Per-issue bounties don't work for specialized knowledge work like this. There are only a few people with in-depth knowledge of the source code and they're not going to compete for bounties if there are other ways to get paid.
No one is going through the trouble to learn the code in-depth either for some bounties here and there. So the patches can be expected to be shallow and of relatively low quality.
Also, bounties encourage drive-by contributors. It is nice if people stick around to fix bugs in what they contributed.
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:14:04
Well, someone needs to fund the developers, certainly initially until the open source project picks up steam. If that ever happens.
That's a difficult issue even for Bitcoin, which was not premined or pre-funded in a similar way.
Note: I'm strongly opposed to centralization built into the software like peercoin that has a central organization broadcast checkpoints or like freicoin to get a % of mining rewards forever. But an initial fundraising makes sense in a way. And that's what ethereum is doing.

They could do deep packet inspection to block direct bitcoin traffic.

You don't even need ASICs to be 'unfair'. I don't quite understand this obsession with the PoW function. In my eyes **any** PoW function has the same problem: 
1) throw lots of money at it to buy (or develop) lots of hardware 
2) build datacenters full of them
3) win.
The NSA or any large company or organization will have no more problems 51%-ing a specific custom PoW algorithm than double-SHA256.
Also: forcing the use of complex CPUs instead of simple custom ASICs helps established players such as Intel and AMD. It also means that current massive general-purpose computation infrastructure can be easily repurposed to do an attack on your network (botnets, server clusters, ...). This is harder/slower if custom hw has to be designed and built first.
But again: any PoW will be beatable by an outsider with enough resources. That's inherent in the design.

@_date: 2014-03-18 07:53:10
Indeed. It always maintains a queue of 100 addresses in advance, to be somewhat more resistant against power loss and such (there is no window for data loss after generating the key before the disk has stored it properly) and to make backups somewhat less frequently (if it wasn't for the keypool you'd have to backup after every transaction).
There is a patch to make keypool refill a manual option, so that it can be combined with a immediate backup. This would make it more transparent to the user, but it never had much acceptance and is unlikely to be merged. It has also been proposed to add a countdown for the number of keys used since last backup.
A better solution is deterministic wallets. A one-time backup would be enough in this case (for the keys, at least). Even though I'm a Bitcoin-Qt developer I can't really recommend using Bitcoin-Qt as a wallet until deterministic key generation is added.
Also: importing/exporting keys is discouraged. Only use these if you know what will happen. And you probably don't! You won't be the first and won't be the last to lose money by irresponsible use of them. The program Armory is better suited if you want to make paper wallets.

Multiple (at least 3-5) developers build the source code, cryptographically sign the result, and upload this (see  These results are compared and only if they match, it is accepted and uploaded to bitcoin.org.
It is utopic to expect that all users learn to compile from source, but more independent gitian builders are very welcome.

Even if some of the criticism is true, the thing is, you could make an equally 'unfair' list about the USD, or the Euro for that matter. A lot of bad stuff goes on in the world, and a lot of that is because people are either need money or want more money.
Since when do you have to 100% agree with how a currency works and all the technology and economy around it to accept it as organization? Bitcoin never promised to solve all of capitalism's issues, so why hold is against a different standard than the old system?
- built-in economic inequality (check)
- most rational actors will try to hoard more by trading for other resources and generally superfluous produced goods, at large cost to the environment
- issuing system is very opaque
- used to finance wars and drug cartels
- tendency to centralize power with banks
- rampant security attacks against holders (street robberies, shoplifting, bank robberies)
Still, I accept USD and Euro as payment, no problem!

    Asking me to get off my soapbox is encouraging me to be silent until I can somehow produce an alternative implementation that doesn't have this issue, which is non trivial.
That's the point isn't it? The payment protocol stuff was extensively discussed on the mailing list beforehand, and similar arguments to yours were raised. However no one could come up with an idea that would be completely decentralized and still easy to use. 
I'm not blaming Bitpay at all: if you're trying to do business, sometimes it is not possible to wait for someone to come up with a 'completely perfect' solution. As they say, perfect is the enemy of good. The current solution suffices for 'merchants' like BitPay and their clients and other use-cases are being worked on in subsequent BIPS.
**No one** believes the current solution is perfect for every use case, not even your supposed cartel of evil core devs. The current solution could be improved, or a better solution can be implemented later. Ideas are welcome. Just submit a proposal.

Yes the user numbers look quite low.
I looked at the unique userids per country, over the course of about a year.
In total there are 89518 unique userids used in the trade logs mentioned (2012-11 to 2013-12).
It could of course be that the leaked data is not complete. Or maybe they have loads of inactive users that registered in 2010/2011 and traded a bit and quit.
Edit: looking at the user IDs themselves they go up to 833612. So they may be correct about having almost a million registered users. However, only about 10% of them appear in the trade logs examined.

You can symlink the wallet.dat but this is not recommended, as the rest of the BerkelyDB environment will still be there. Especially if you link over file system boundaries this can cause corruption! (and it can cause key leakage too... the log files contain database records)

You don't need to remove the data directory or block chain! Uninstall will only touch executables not your data.

Yes, there is already a malleability bot at work. It causes some noise such as duplicate-looking transactions in the transaction list but in no way disrupts the network or wallet balances. 
It *can* cause problems if you use txids as identifiers in software on top: if you use only txid for checking whether a transaction went though and re-issue transactions with *new* inputs, you can end up sending double the coins. This is what happened at mtgox. So: make sure you invalidate the old transaction if you have to re-issue for some reason.
Anyway for the OP: This issue was already known and *being* solved for a long time. There are concrete steps for moving forward: 
However it is not possible to apply these new rules all at once willy-nilly because it would likely break current software. They have to be carefully introduced. Rushing a change would likely make things worse for actual implementations.

Let's get this clear: While the bitcoin foundation funds a few devs it was not ever the intention that it would be the sole organization contributing to bitcoin development.

To be precise: the wallet will be phased out / moved to a seperate project. There will remain a GUI for node management, similar to the debug window in current Bitcoin-Qt, some things will be added like a peer list and more detailed statistics.
But you're right in that the UI won't be a priority. The goal of the development team is to optimize Bitcoin Core for the absolute core task: maintaining the network infrastructure. Better DoS protection, parallel block download, bandwidth quotas, etc.

Wallets assume that your own change (resulting from your own outgoing transactions), even if it is unconfirmed, is safe to re-spend. 
This assumption is generally safe but the malleability can cause chains of unconfirmed transactions to be broken.
Unconfirmed inputs from others are obviously never spent.

If a mass attack happens by the current crop of miners, switching PoW is one of the options. Pretty much a nuclear option at that. It's hard to coordinate and inconvenient.
On the long run that means the PoW model is broken, but in the short run it does mean all the current hardware is no longer usable in an attack, so it will stave off the attack. A new PoW could also be made to be less easy to build ASICs for, as despite my earlier beliefs it turns out to be easy to corner that market and have one company gain disproportionate centralized power over mining.

Because they were deceived into believing that bitcoin was a low-cost, virtually-infinite-bandwidth payment network. Remember all the crazy stuff people were saying about bitcoin and micro-transactions (on-chain) in the beginning!
They formed their business model around that. It cannot cope with the reality that things are different. Simply raising the block size would be suicide for that which makes bitcoin worthwhile in the first place, decentralization and censorship-resistance. Without that it's just an inefficient PayPal 2.0 and no one should want that: it will get its ass kicked by actual Paypal and other efficient centralized or federated solutions.
What I don't entirely understand is why they're not enthusiastic about Lightning and other distributed off-chain solutions. They'd essentially provide what they thought was promised. But maybe that'd result in too good privacy for them (some of them are also into bitcoin because, without further privacy improvements, it's very easy to track and collect user information.)
@_date: 2016-05-08 06:45:44
Also mind that at least theoretically, the only thing that matters for privacy when using bitcoin core, unless you're trying to hide that you're running bitcoin, is transaction broadcast. The rest of what you're relaying is public data (for SPV wallets the situation is different as they also send a filter that leaks information about the addresses in the wallet).
One could use the -walletbroadcast=0 option to disable automatic broadcasting of transactions from the wallet, then through some more private mechanism broadcast transactions.

It depends on your threat model. From a pure block explorer perspective you are right, however the exchanges certainly track what is coming in and going out and link it to, say, an IP address or account. And they will give this information when asked by LE.
So if you do it this way you should at least be using different exchanges for each "leg", and make sure the accounts are not linkable to you, etc. That's a lot more complex and hard to get right (as well as possibly questionably legally) than using joinmarket.
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:54:41
Though you have a fair point, one can't solve all problems in the world at once. There are privacy issues for users right now, and those can be solved or at least ameliorated by implementing current research and making it accessible to users.
There is a significant "it must be perfect" culture in infosec, and I think your post illustrates is very well. In the end security and privacy tech is about increasing the cost of attacks, incrementally. We won't build a thousand year impenetrable fortress.
Making the system quantum resistant will have to be tackled at some point, but the number of people that have enough knowledge to work on that is extremely small, even lower than the number of people that understand privacy tech. Then the intersection of those... (In any case, not trying to demotivate you, feel free to make proposals that fix both issues at once!)

The foundation already pays a few devs besides Gavin (me, for instance). However I don't think it should all come down on the foundation.
The idea behind the Bitcoin Foundation was that they wouldn't hire many devs, but the companies profiting from Bitcoin would, and the foundation would be like the Linux Foundation for facilitating  communication, test infrastructure, a bit of coordination, promotion etc...
So I wonder where are all those early adopters, miners, merchants who hire core devs? (Bitpay excluded, which hired Jeff Garzik)
We could especially use more people that review and test code changes closely -- as that's the main bottleneck to faster progess.
If the foundation would hire zillions of devs, the project would essentially be completely owned by it. How would that be in accordance with the distributed nature of Bitcoin?

It will indeed be a hard fork, but unlike the security-critical ones it can be announced way in advance.

It won't be trivial alright, so the decision won't be taken lightly. It could be planned years ahead, by adding support to the client but only enabling it once a certain block number is reached, and/or when a big majority of blocks contains a certain identifier.
Only by making people aware that this *can* happen they will design their applications and interfaces accordingly.

In general, if you're not having problems you don't *need* to upgrade. This release is not urgent in that people need to upgrade ASAP for network integrity.
However, 0.8.6 is a maintenance release so it is recommended to update to it. Maintenance releases only contain relatively minor changes that fix known issues and increase stability.
On the other hand 0.9.0 would be a major/feature release, and wouldn't come with an encouragement to update.

All good an well - but if no one is funding Bitcoin development, how can people dedicate their time to it?
Sure, it is a distributed project, but as the last few years have shown there are only a few very active developer contributors to the project itself. There is an enormous ecosystem around bitcoin, but that doesn't help maintaining the infrastructure.
Having at least a few full time developers (such as Gavin) working on the project helps increase expertise, helps gets bugs fixed, and makes sure that people are paying attention to network security and health issues, and that future improvements are implemented.
It certainly doesn't have to be the Bitcoin Foundation (or Bitcoin Grant) funding these developers, it is a distributed project and anyone could, but why is no one else doing it? Where are the merchants, miners and mining pools paying people to work on the project (okay, jgarzik moved to BitPay, so there is one exception...)?

  - Some special care has to be taken here to make this workable for SPV wallets, which can't inspect the last few blocks and mempool to determine the fee.
- Payment requests: Will be in 0.9. However the format is documented in detail in BIP 70 (  ) so there is no reason why other wallets couldn't build in support for them right now. But yes, likely other wallet authors are waiting for 0.9 to be released first to make interaction easier to test.

We were talking about a random coin generator in  at a certain point. Some features that I remember:
- Pick a random name from a dictionary, append 'coin' to it
- Pick a random hashing algorithm + parameters
- Pick a random premining amount
- Google for said name on google images, pull first image, automatically create the 'coin' logo from it by extracting a circle and inserting the first letter of the name in it.
- Create a simple website (=just clone bitcoin.org replace a few words and the colors/logos)
- Make a bitcointalk.org altcoin post and other announcements
- Generate 50 forum shills to reply positively in the topic and promote it all over the forum
- Profit!

Yes, definitely use an offline wallet for storing the bulk amount (protects you against hacking).
Make sure you also store encrypted backups in as many places as possible (protects you against loss)
Dividing it in smaller amounts (such as 10BTC) indeed lowers the risk, as you can verify / spend each one individually.

None of those (well except for switching to C) are in opposition with the current goals of the bitcoin core devs. No need to make any ruckus about it, you make it sound like it's some grandiose act of rebellion.
1. Agreed, standard/non-standard transactions are meant as a belt-and-suspenders feature and need to go away at some point once the scripting system and its uses/abuses are better understood.
2. If you think using another DB backend for the blockchain would be better, feel free to make one (and make a good argument for it). It DB stuff is pretty well abstracted.
As for BDB we'd very much like to get rid of it, and will do so once a better (if possible, append only) wallet format can replace it. People have worked on this, but it's a huge amount of work and especially testing.
We'd also be supportive of a --no-wallet autoconf option that builds without BDB and/or all the wallet stuff.
3. Again, this is a no-brainer. Once the build infrastructure is in place to modularize bitcoin (a libbitcoin.a is already being built, so should even be much work, it's just not exported, and it probably should be multiple libraries for the blockchain/network/wallet handling not one), bitcoin-qt could move to a seperate git repo.
4. Going from C++ to C sounds to me like going even further back in time (to a language that's just as unsafe). I don't think moving to another programming language should be any priority, especially with many other issues to address.
5. Yes, agreed, this is why smart fees work is in progress. You could help review it.
6. Again, no opposition here, feel free to make this happen.
So feel free to join development on the main project instead.

Version numbers are not decimals but tuples. The major release after 0.9.0 could just as well be 0.10.0. 
The 1.0.0 release will not be based on running out of numbers, but on when the dev team feels the reference client software (not the currency, or ecosystem, or anything else) is 1.0-ready.

I initially thought the miners and mining pools would chime in, as they have a big interest in maintaining and improving the network, as well as increasing adoption. But it is not turning out this way. No one in the community is paying for improving the software (at least directly; you could say that Bitpay's move to hire a core developer was a step forward).
Core client development is sort of an elephant in the room for Bitcoin, but it is hardly discussed at all outside some small circles.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:34:42
Sorry, there are zillions of reasons for not pushing Bitcoin to the masses, but your mentioned reasons are wrong
- Non-techy people should not be using the Bitcoin-qt client. Please use a SPV wallet if you just want a wallet and are not explicitly interested in sacrificing resources in maintaining the network.
- We're not even close to pushing the transaction limits. The maximum block size is 1MB, and a cursory glance at  shows that most blocks are not even close.
Valid reasons would be:
- Lack of hardware wallets and other safe solutions for storing coins without lots of technical knowledge (looking forward to Trezor)
- No practical escrow solutions in general use yet - transactions are irreversible and this can be confusing for users that expect to be protected
- Waiting for more adoption by gatekeepers such as app stores or other companies, to do payouts partially or wholly in bitcoin so that "buying on an exchange" evils are not needed and people can just offer services instead.
@_date: 2013-05-16 05:20:41
Bitcoin-qt is an unfunded project and updated by a few people in their spare time. What did you expect?
When have you last paid a bitcoin developer for their work? When have you submitted a patch to github? Nothing will change if the community just waits and makes demands.
I know everyone has been spoon-fed with the idea of a government that takes care of issues if you just shout enough, but as bitcoin has no "tax" that's not going to work. There are no votes, no rallies, there's just the work of people that contribute voluntarily. And if no one does it's a classic example of "tragedy of the commons".

I agree that is prudent advice, in general. But if you're anything like me, you'll tell yourself this at every step up in Bitcoin popularity. "If only after the next bump, I'm going into this fulltime". Right up until the point that it is deemed safe for everybody and all the good opportunities are taken.
If it is pretty easy for you to find a new job, and if you have savings for some runway, you can afford to take the risk to do something you are not 100% sure will pan out. This doesn't mean take an irresponsible leap, but tbh Bitcoin has been around for a while now and it won't just go away. And for example recently core developer Jeff Garzik quit his comfy job at Redhat to work for a Bitcoin startup.

You can also pass an argument to that command: the number of keys you want to generate. By default this is 100, or what is passed using -keypool command line option. You could err on the safe side and generate 1000 keys in advance, for example.
Personally I'd really like to see the manual keypool control option ( end up inside bitcoin-qt as it removes a source of uneasyness. When the keypool runs out you know you have to top up the pool and thus make a new backup that contains those keys.

Encrypting your wallet (at least with bitcoind/-qt) will hide the private keys. It will not hide the public keys, so though they cannot spend your coins they *can* figure out which addresses you control.

In the first version, the source was only packaged with the Windows executables. Later on, but still pretty early (around 0.1.x) the project was put on sourceforge in SVN. Much later (around version 0.3.x, after Satoshi left) the project was moved to Github for easier collaboration.

It doesn't really matter whether you think it will be a problem. I personally don't think so either -- I don't expect BTC to blow up that far but coexist in a world with many (crypto)currencies with different advantages and disadvantages.
That doesn't mean it can't happen, or that it's nonsensical to think about what to do if it would.
I know about micropayment channels but keeping data outside the block chain has advantages as well as disadvantages and is orthogonal to this discussion.

That may seem like a good idea now, but it would be temporary as there is nothing "holy" about satoshis. It will not be the smallest atomic amount forever. Once it becomes necessary, the amount of divisibility will be increased from 10^8, and we'd just as well end up with millisatoshis and such.

Example test plans:
They can be pretty simple, or very complex depending on the change, but they should test the new functionality and also some regression.
How many people take part in the tests depends on the interest. If it is a popular change you should not have problems finding people willing to test it. 
If you are not a developer, you can still help development by executing test plans for changes that you'd like to be merged (you can download the executables produced by the pulltester and test with those).

I wonder what exactly is sped up by 30%? The initial block sync?
In bitcoind we've noticed that the worst bottleneck is ECDSA verification performance. By using sipa's secp256k1 library instead of OpenSSL for verification a significant speed-up (certainly 20-30%) can be achieved. However, it is still deemed too risky to include that by default. It may be offered in 0.9 as an option for wallet-less and mining-less builds.
Using a specially adapted leveldb for the block chain / UTXO is interesting, but for now we're happy that it is no longer corrupting on any platform. Let's aim for stability first.

It does not hash at all. It is a P2P node implementation, not a miner. There are already quite a few miner implementations, so that would be nothing new. The parallelism (concurrency) is for being able to handle large numbers of connections at the same time.

Well one of his points is that the bitcoin-qt project needs more developers and testers. I fully agree with that. The current developers (except for Gavin which works for the Bitcoin Foundation and Jeff Garzik for Bitpay) contribute in their spare time for free (ironic for a currency), this means that development is pretty slow and they work only on the issues that interest them. 
The project really needs one or two more full-time developers on it, but the biggest problem is how to finance that. The most obvious would be a "Donate to development" button in the client. It's still unclear how well this would work but it's worth a try.
@_date: 2013-05-21 17:52:00

This has been proposed many times, and I think it is a good idea. The switch to mBTC or μBTC has to be made eventually.
However I am afraid the problem is that no one with a service is going to take initiative to change the default, for fear of confusing users. Suddenly using a different unit creates a quite a risk of buying or selling or sending the wrong amount. One idea might be to default to the smaller unit only for new users and let current users choose.

Absolutely. But no incentive for them to work on a bitcoin node implementation. It's a huge and difficult job (lots of testing work to get it exactly right) with hardly any expected payoff. Unless you're very good at marketing your node as well and somehow manage to sell it to companies, but that's a huge stretch at the moment as it's mostly the small shops interested in it (and bitcoind, even though it has its warts, works well enough for most cases).
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:51:29
Ouch, painful hear this, luckily you managed to recover it eventually.
We should really make bitcoin-qt use deterministic wallets, it's currently almost impossible to make up-to-date backups without being scared all the time.
[Although this doesn't change the necessity of making a new backup after encryption - that is a security feature: it generates new keys after encryption because the keys in the old unencrypted wallet.dat may still be floating around in the empty space of your harddisk]

I don't think for these kind of huge projects a tip is appropriate. It requires working for a longer time, and engineers like to paid during that time. They will likely not even start the work, afraid just to see the bounty being claimed just before finishing by someone else (this also encourages cutting corners instead of quality).
Might be better to find someone with experience in designing ASICs (a known track record), who can give a realistic estimate of the amount of work involved. It may not even be that much work if you can start from the open source FPGA implementation (which is already VHDL), but setting a random tip amount without predictable payout schedule is pretty much a gamble :-)

Good question. No, they can't. Bitcoin is a decentralized system and no organization controls it.
The developers are not in a privileged position, except that people trust them.
If they break that trust, someone can fork the project (with the troublesome changes rolled back) and take over from them. After convincing enough people to use the new client instead of the old client, which won't be difficult if it's intentionally broken, the network will go on as normal.

It gets merged if a consensus of core devs has reviewed it and thinks it's a good idea and the correct implementation. At least for complicated and potentially complicated changes (see "Development Process" here:  You may also have to come up with a test plan to test your change and rally people to execute it.
If the overall idea is liked, when you submit a pull you will get replies with comments and nits about the code. If you fix those it will be merged. This review process can take a while, but as it is critical I hope that's expected.
Simple fixes (such as UI tweaks or build system tweaks or very little code impact or easy to test) usually go in much easier.
Everyone (with good coding skills) can become core dev eventually by following and fixing issues and generally being active with the project for a longer time. I don't understand what you mean with "compartimentalized". This is all done in the open on github.

Thanks for the sanity. +2 mBTC
(edit: from the help it appears bitcointip doesn't accept uBTC/μBTC?)
Yes, the satoshi (1/100000000) is an implementation detail of the current protocol, it should not be seen as some definite and user-sensible subdivision (as SI units are). That's why it is not offered as a unit in the reference client, and also won't ever be.
The closest would be to switch to μBTC (1 millionth) by default at some point. This would make the "satoshis" the only two decimals (6+2=8).
Almost everyone seems to agree that there needs to be a smaller default unit. The problem is that there are just way too many opinions about the split-up (core team is divided between mBTC and μBTC), which unfortunately makes it less likely to happen.

Running around screaming, complaining, and throwing pitchforks and torches at members of our community is not helpful though :)

Another bitcoin core dev here. Agreed. As I said before I'd like to include privacy preserving features (as long as reasonable, for example I'm about to merge coin control, and I like coinjoin). I'm not sure why the OP thinks that the core devs are evil and out to destroy bitcoin. And destroying fungibility *will* destroy bitcoin.

One of the selling points of CoinJoin is that it has no recognizable profile. See gmaxwell's topic here, it's very informative: 
If enough people were to use coinjoin, attempts at taint analysis will be foiled *even for people that don't use it*. 
Sure, that doesn't rule out all threats to privacy, but it's a start, and it's relatively easy to get in, in contrast to Chaumian blinding and such which seem to require deep protocol changes. In time, zerocoin may well be the solution but as the perfect is the enemy of the good as always.

It is one of the well-known disadvantages of closed-source software: less eyes on the source, much harder to find out what is hidden in it.
Though a bitcoin miner would be quite easy to spot given the CPU/GPU usage, especially by gamers. As the chance of getting caught is very high I doubt this particular practice is very widespread. But I'm also sure they aren't the only ones thinking of this stupid idea.

I liked this book. Like any good SF, it deals with real societal issues of the day but juxtaposed into an alien setting (with some cool technology and speculative science thrown in for good measure).
Another recommended read for Bitcoiners would be the Daemon and Freedom series by Daniel Suarez.

Just FYI we don't have the death penalty in the Netherlands. I had to chuckle though :)

Setting a separate path for the wallet and chain files is not yet possible. It is possible, however, to set the data directory which contains both the wallet and chain files, see  .

If you rely on Bitcoin for any substantial business, you should really make some time for that (or hire someone to make time for that). We need more people that review pull requests (changes) on github. This is currently the main bottleneck to faster development.
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:22:02
I agree. This infighting hurts the public view of Bitcoin, and is at large with the foundation's mission. He should have at least tried to resolve it out of court first. A vote should be held for Bitcoin foundation members for him to be removed as executive director.

Oh you're right, it will do some hashing operations, but for verifying blocks ECDSA operations are the bottleneck, not hashing, so that does not make asking how fast does it hash a useful question :)

They'll just sit where they are. Once they become spendable again (ie, when the cost to send them is less than their worth), you can spend them again. Nothing is lost.

Not currently, this was proposed (  ) but closed for lack of interest.

But on the other hand, it seems quite a few of the Wikipedia editors have always have a hostile stance toward bitcoin, and even try to get the article deleted. So it's a two-way thing...

Yes, a -walletdir would be useful. 
Multi-wallet support is coming which should make this possible.

100% agree. If you ignore people's points just because they are 'weird'  you miss a lot.
In a way you're always behind because what society sees as 'normal' acts as a very slow filter.
You'd have missed Bitcoin too, new ideas seem so weird initially, even good ideas.
Having said that, I wouldn't have replied to this particular blackmail message either.

That's great, congratulations  keep up the good work!

No, it has nothing to do with the wallet database, only the block chain database. So it's not possible to lose money due to this bug. 
It is however always possible that  your wallet gets corrupted due to other glitches (either software or hardware), so be sure to keep reliable backups.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:23:15
To be fair, it is a test build of a stable release, which always contain only very conservative changes. So it should be reasonably safe.
(unlike a test release of a completely new master spin-off, such as 0.9.0rc1 would be, which includes lots of new features)
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:30:21
This is the last time I'm going to say this, but I'm so tired of this confusion: All of the core devs of Bitcoin are vehemently opposed to CoinValidation or taint bullshit, and for merging measures that improve privacy.
Mike Hearn doesn't even contribute to reference client project, he maintains bitcoinj. Even then, his talk about taint was just a mind experiment nothing more, he is not supporting of CoinValidation in any way. Gmaxwell *proposed* CoinJoin and CoinSwap. Jgarzik is supportive of CoinJoin as you can see here:  . Gavin was in favor of merging coin control. Laanwj/wumpus (me) helpt merge coin control a few days ago and I've expressed my like for CoinJoin and such many times.
Of course the grandparent post has a good point that the technology needs to be tested carefully (possibly in an altchain) before introducing it into Bitcoin, otherwise it would be a great risk.
Also it is in big part up to the open source community. Please contribute code that makes bitcoin safer and more private.
@_date: 2013-05-26 10:32:51
To prevent problems like this, always use the block chain to transfer funds. Please don't mess around with importing/exporting private keys. Having private keys exist in multiple places (or clients) at once is bad practice.
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:43:40
I don't think Gavin wants to be face of bitcoin. He could have been, but that would leave no time for development. Not everyone likes talking to the press and doing organizational activities all day. The same likely holds for the other reference client developers.
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:49:27
A new key from the keypool is only used when you create a new receiving address or do a send (for the change) with that wallet. If the wallet is never online it will never be adding new keys.
BTW you can increase the number of keys in the keypool by starting bitcoind/-qt with say -keypool 1000 and then executing "keypoolrefill" through RPC or debug console.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:00:35
Does it also find keys from encrypted wallets?

What happened to nefario anyway? I do remember GLBSE closed down under strange circumstances.
@_date: 2013-05-14 16:34:34
Wow, someone that gets it! The problem is that bitcoin-qt is not funded, so people can go around screaming they want a certain feature all they want, but it's not just going to happen out of altruism. There is no bitcoin "government" that takes cares of the desires of people that scream the loudest.
A possible option for funding (that is being discussed) would is to add a "donate" button to the client. Or an % of fee that can be optionally enabled that goes to the dev team.
In any case, if someone were to put up a bounty for specifically this issue I'm sure it will be solved pretty soon.
@_date: 2013-05-19 18:21:41
This is a myth, actually. The bitcoin foundation is *not* developing the Satoshi client. None of the core developers apart from Gavin is paid by the Bitcoin Foundation.
Also: there are a few alternatives being developed by other groups that aim to implement a full node; at least  (in Java),  (in Golang).
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:39:23
It doesn't become easier to choose by proposing *more* subdivision alternatives. This divides the community further and makes it very unlikely for a new default to ever happen.
(Of course you personally, or you group of friends, can use any subdivision unit you wish. But if we can't get everyone to agree it won't just ever happen as default)
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:19:44
Agreed. Also Litecoin is a proving ground for new ideas, as it's easier to get changes integrated than in Bitcoin (which is very conservative with changes for good reason I might say...).
And Litecoin uses a different mining algo so it doesn't compete with Bitcoin for miners.
So it may be good that it exists, overall. And in contrast to other altcoins it has a knowledgeable and active development team which works together with the Bitcoin devs.
Having said that, there is no reason to think Litecoin will get adopted in favor of BTC, or overtake BTC in any way.
@_date: 2013-05-10 12:24:29
Even the Satoshi=10^8 is only an implementation detail, and the block chain protocol can be changed (albeit it requires a hard fork) when a smaller subdivision is needed. It is not "holy" like the max 21 million coins.
