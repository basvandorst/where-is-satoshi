Price tanked from around $15.6k to $14k in a few hours.  My wife heard a rumour that it was Wall Street getting Bitcoin on the cheap.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:38:31
Finally some good news, this topic should be getting a lot of up-votes! 
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:51:03
That's the spirit :) 
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:22:42
It's times like this that will hopefully reward the people that stayed strong in these turbulent times. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:26:53
I would say around $14,750 at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:11:51
Please research the process before doing it and then you come complaining when if you had asked on here before there would have been many people that would have helped you.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:33:12
Yes that is from their site.  When you are on those support pages, look carefully and there is a section that says this...
"Have more questions? Submit a request"
When you click on 'Submit a request' it takes you to the page I linked..
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:29:03
What I find hard to understand is that a few hours ago people were buying lots and lots of Bitcoin around $17k and now there are people selling lots around $16.4k
I find it amazing how the market can turn so quickly! 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:41:23
The Goon Show! 
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:21:30
It's actually $700 lower now. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:38:34
Don't joke about matters like this.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:30:01
Is that normal for you this time of the year?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:48:24
We need some sustained good news.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:57:05
Very well said that man, a lot of people in this scene want easy money in weeks, days or even hours.  I'm happy to HODL for many years and will see what happens. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:45:49
Yeah it must be hard or otherwise they would all do it.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:45:38
Ok thanks although why can't they transfer money into the American or European exchanges? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:14:07
Supply and demand
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:50:06
You try going on any forum and saying that product is a scam in your username, see how long you will last!  :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:05:04
Very true!
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:08:04
How do you know so much about the developers? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:09:04
I'm in this long term but periods like the last few days worry me.  I find it hard to understand how we got to over $17.2k over the weekend and now we are at $15.5k

SEOUL/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Threats of a potential cryptocurrency trading ban in South Korea have scared many investors away, but some veterans of the young market are defiant, saying restrictions would be relatively easy to circumvent.
Although the cryptocurrency market lost about $200 billion this week, or a third of its value, these investors - known within the community as “hodlers” after a misspelled meme that went viral during Bitcoin’s early days - are used to rollercoaster rides.
China's shutdown of local exchanges in September, for instance, caused a 50 percent drop in Bitcoin, but prices rebounded eight-fold to almost $20,000. Currently valued around $10,000, Bitcoin BTC=BTSP could be poised for a similar whirlwind this time around, some say.
“In case the government shuts down all local exchanges, investors can always go abroad and open an account there,” said a South Korean student who declined to be named because of legal risks. “I can ask my friends who study abroad or travel there myself. It’s not that big of a problem.”
Cryptocurrency experts say the student probably has good reason to be relaxed. A ban could discourage new market entrants, but the anonymity of buyers and sellers and the ability to move digital assets anywhere in the world with a click makes it hard to impose restrictions on existing participants without a global consensus.
Places like Singapore and Hong Kong maintain light regulations, while neighboring Japan has encouraged a vast ecosystem of companies and investors around digital assets by pioneering a set of rules for the industry. Germany has said national restrictions may be useless.
VPNs, OFFLINE WALLETS
According to industry experts, the first step to circumventing a ban is hiding IP addresses from authorities via virtual private networks (VPNs).
Traders can then continue business as usual. Decentralized exchanges, such as Shapeshift or Stellar Dex, do not require identification and can be accessed from anywhere.
Cryptocurrency wallets such as Exodus and Jaxx are linked to such exchanges, so trading and storing the assets can still be anonymous. Authorities in countries with strong legal protections may need a warrant to check computers or smartphones for proof of such activity.
Even then, unless caught in the act, the holder can claim no trading has taken place since the legislation was approved and has forgotten the password for the wallet.
    Some decentralized exchanges offer derivative products that allow betting on the price of a cryptocurrency against a fiat currency, including the Korean won and Chinese yuan. But cashing out in fiat is not possible on such exchanges.
    An option in that case is to trade all cryptocurrencies for a top one such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin, and sell it at one the 2,064 crypto ATMs in 61 countries, although the transaction fees can exceed 10 percent. If need be, coins can be stored on offline “wallets” the size of a USB stick.
Alternatively, holders can open bank accounts in countries that have not banned Bitcoin, then join a local centralized exchange where they can trade cryptocurrencies for fiat.
    “I hold everything in a hard wallet the size of my thumb. I have copies of my private keys in a safe. I have accounts on four exchanges on three continents. If any government wants my money, good luck to them,” said a Hong Kong-based investor who claims to hold “about $1 million” in various cryptocurrencies.
CROSSING BORDERS
A 30-year-old nurse in Seoul said she had already switched to Hong Kong-based exchange Binance before the government’s warnings hit the market. Company officers at Seoul-based exchanges say, anecdotally, such moves have accelerated.
“All this could lead to serious money outflow and only the government is not aware of it,” one officer said, requesting anonymity.
South Korea accounts for between 5 and 15 percent of daily Bitcoin trading. The value of all Bitcoins is around $200 billion.
If opening accounts overseas proves difficult, friends, family or the local Bitcoin community can help. Another option is to find someone with access to an exchange - preferably using encrypted social media apps such as Whatsapp or Telegram - and sell to them at a discount. But fraud is a risk.
“There could be a black market where people who can cash out offshore can pay you in won for your Bitcoins,” said Aurelian Menant, chief executive of Hong-Kong based exchange Gatecoin.
But that leaves the door open to “dodgy stuff,” Menant said, adding that the fear of scams in the aftermath of a ban may deter new investors, potentially shrinking Korean trading volumes “from billions to millions.”

Good point and sadly no lambo here yet :)
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:04:01
I want it to go up a lot but sideways is better then down.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:24:11
I totally agree with this, you can see the times when they wake up we go up a little and then around 5pm New York time the market again picks up.
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:44:56
Exactly and it's not even news.  
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:21:18
Stay safe and warm :) 
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:19:59
On  Bitcoin is around $16.3k
Maybe all this buying on GDAX is just trying to get closer to the current market price. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:29:38
That would be a good idea also.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:16:58
I know and I appreciate your opinion  :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:27:48
Sell walls can come and go very easily/quickly. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:27:18
Is market capitalization that important?  There are so many altcoins that it was always going to be the case that Bitcoin's percentage dropped a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:14:13
I can't disagree with your comments and people should always make their own decisions.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:54:29
Ok thanks :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:42:57
Thank you  :) 
Is there any rough idea when it will really start to take shape? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:34:56
Do you ever leave the house when it's -31 C? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:11:10
I never proclaim to have any inside knowledge.  I'm just delighted that it looks like we are going to have our first positive day in what seems a long time.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:55:10
Totally, it seems someone high up in Reuters has been told what to say about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:18:54
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:38:29
You have not lost anything, you just need to wait.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:35:18
I think that must be the reason and the cycle keeps going on and on.
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:38:07
You say that and while I think you are right up to a certain point it does seems that a few of the big traders on GDAX can control the price when it suits them.  These last few days they have managed to keep the price fairly steady.   
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:49:59
Just when the price starts to recover they have problems.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:40:13
Thanks.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:15:56
Good luck :) 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:08:20
I guess so but we are guessing.....

Here is the link to submit a request.....
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:07:53
I think we have a chance!  
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:07:20
Please use Litecoin, please never use BCash.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:09:25
I'm thinking when people start seliing off their Ethereum we will see another rise in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:05:41
Care to expand on that please.  :) 
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:11:15
GDAX was fine! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:04:52
You don't know what is going to happen.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:20:37
So overall it's been a relatively positive week then?  :) 
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:39:02
Thank You South Korean people who have signed. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:15:29
The price is going up now so how do you plan on doing that!? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:11:28
Looks like America is helping us go back up again :) 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:15:25
Nice theory but for ever short position there needs to be a long.  Are you telling me some billionaires also lost a lot of money to the people that shorted Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:34:36
South Korea won't ban trading at all, this is fear mongering.  Bitcoin was close to $15k when this news broke, you can get it for $1.5k less now....that's good value.  Obviously Bitcoin is not cheap but the price now is very good value.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:05:30
Can you sell a few more cars please  :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:38:12
I don't think so at all.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:31:37
Will we see another wave of buying today as America wakes up?
It's 8.30am in New York right now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:36:48
Signing in, this is the time to HODL. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:36:17
lose not loose
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:37:44
GONE!  :) 
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:31:26
Keep up the good work. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:35:05
Already in profit :) 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:54:11
Why would a gradual mining ban affect the price so much!?  
If anything it should be seen as positive news as the less that happens in China the better.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:10:25
I thought that until I saw the huge buys going in.  They were being bought in massive sizes, like 25 Bitcoins in one go.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:29:24
That would be a good idea.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:06:25
How many Bitcoin have you got or how many did you sell already?
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:55:39
Thanks for posting, good video.
Always make me feel better when I watch one of his videos. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:48:37
Hopefully a very positive day and weekend : )
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:19:37
If it was easy then someone or a lot of people would already be doing it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:05:07
Have you got any friends in North Korea? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:19:01
I think a lot of people have spent a lot of money around Christmas and the New Year period so it might take a month or so until people are back on their feet money wise.  Perhaps a nice increase towards the end of January. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:40:21
Cool and no worries. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:10:52
So you had to mine it in the first year or so? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:29:36
Loverly juberly :) 
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:15:49
100% SCAM. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:05:25
So what needs to happen for the bulls to start taking control?
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:33:04
Now that you know what happened it seems obvious but it might not have played out the way it did. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:39:09
All good points.  I notice that on GDAX volume is really low today at around 13,500 sold over the last 24 hours.  I guess low volume also leads to a decrease in price perhaps.....
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:39:59
GDAX price shot up between 8am GMT and around 10am GMT, from around $15k to $16.1k 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:14:09
Why do the Korean exchanges have such a higher price?
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:08:55
Anyone with any sense would take anything he says with a big pinch of salt!
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:58:07
Got through $14k no problems  : )
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:10:30
Hopefully the bulls/whales have just had their breakfast and we get past $17k again today. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:40:11
Very good post! 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:46:30
So you don't know why then :) 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:09:26
All the best my friend :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:51:33


@_date: 2018-01-16 11:11:46
Totally!  
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:15:03
How cold? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:49:17
Ok what would happen to the GDAX market if someone just went on a buying frenzy with $500 million? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:55:55
I know my friend.  HSBC were laundering billions for the Mexican Drug Cartels.  They were caught doing it, no one went to jail.  They got a fine.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:37:30
Yeah but if it goes down really low then the market is dead, so how far do they push it?
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:55:57
Banks are experts in money laundering because they all do it all the time.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:24:17
Thanks for the reply.  What were the wallets like at the start?  How did you store your coins?
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:20:09
Damn that is cold, that's -5 Centigrade
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:54:01
What is a TA junkie?
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:12:38
They probably have to produce an article everyday.  So they have to write something. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:03:37
No one knows what is going to happen but the last two hours or so have been positive. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:43:58

@_date: 2018-01-03 20:46:19
Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:56:31
Good news. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:03:18
Go for a walk or watch some TV, your transaction will go through in the next day or so.  Bitcoin is a work in progress, if it was 100% perfect it would be worth a lot more then what it is worth right now.
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:43:03
Well said and I wish you all the best OP.  Scammers are serious low life! 
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:14:02
Welcome :)
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:21:56
Yes I wrote the article for coindesk!  
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:04:58
Why can't you just hodl the coins and live of welfare like you have been doing?
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:11:19
It's appreciated. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:40:52
I strongly believe this as well.  All the media outlets are owned by big business and it's so easy for them to put out exactly what they want which in turn gives them cheaper Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:10:15
You would know!
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:52:12
Can you post the story.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:49:39
Thank you for your efforts.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:46:49
Just wondered really, I know a lot about Bitcoin now but not much about the early days in terms of how coins were purchased or stored.
I had heard all about what happened with Mtgox. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:52:05
They cause most problems when it comes to money. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:19:10
Give us the transaction details and someone will try to help you.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:15:57
Yeah I noticed that.  What's the latest on the L.N.? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:02:21
I'm hoping all these times of deciding to hodl pay off in the long run. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:56:54
Nice writing :) 
I too am keeping the faith.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:33:18
I understand what you mean but at the moment this is Bitcoin and due to it being so popular there is a transaction backlog at present.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:23:48
It is being addressed every hour of every day.  There is not one single person that is interested in Bitcoin that does not know about this because we have had so many of the exact same posts.  These posts are close to pointless.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:35:59
Why did they drop the Korean exchanges? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:26:10
Might be a stupid question but why can't you buy them through an exchange? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:17:05
True :) 
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:29:27
What does that mean?  Can you do an idiot's explaination please.
@_date: 2019-07-09 10:23:14
you forgot to add the on x day of the week and the reason....because it's my payday.  :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:18:16
Agree to a certain extent but why are so many people falling for it? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:05:01
Why don't you explain why you think it's a dinosaur.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:08:32
They are working on getting this sorted, read up about the Lightning Network.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:08:53
Yep, nothing is guaranteed in this world. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:37:12

I thought he was very wide of the mark on this one.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:17:50
Don't you think the people buying 25 Bitcoins and more in single transactions know all about the transaction backlog.  I don't think it matters to them.
People are buying Bitcoin for the future when there won't be any backlog.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:44:22
Your username is against the rules.

@_date: 2018-01-03 19:30:31
Going by the article, I think the guy that wrote it is saying it's possible Bitcoin will get to $18k in the next few days. 
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:46:11
Yep, they love the Green Coin  :)
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:58:18
Just out of interest why have you got 0.5 Bitcoin when you don't like it or think it's a scam?
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:10:12
LN is not ready yet, what makes you think it's shitty?
I'm pretty sure no other coin has come up with anything close to LN yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:12:21
Any views why we were seeing lots of buying taking us over $17k over the majority of the weekend and now this morning UK time we see prices as low as $15.2k?
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:29:05
I hope you get this sorted.

The most important takeaway from Trump’s outburst is that bitcoin’s significance has now reached presidential level. While this may elevate the risk of negative repercussions, it also brings forward the potential, highlighting how far the concept has come: once an obscure and complex idea developed by a niche group of coders, bitcoin is now a global phenomenon that has attracted not just support from investors and corporations of all types, but also the attention of world leaders.
In the extremely unlikely event that Trump decides to go after bitcoin, either at the protocol level or on the service layer, he will certainly be vociferously challenged in the courts. The hearings could generate debilitating uncertainty, but at the same time they would push the conversation even further along the path of regulatory clarity, and the resulting decisions on limits to federal power, the freedom inherent in code and even an official recognition of the potential of cryptocurrency will impact tech development at all levels.
I’ve said before that one of the strongest appeals of bitcoin for investors is its asymmetric risk: the chance that it will go to zero (and the impact that would have on a portfolio) is less than the chance its price will increase 10x.
We have here another type of asymmetric risk. The chance that Trump will try to ban bitcoin is not zero, but it is significantly less than the benefit to the ecosystem of the heightened level of conversation. Even though the road may be bumpy, when the President of the United States of America tweets about a decentralized store of value designed to circumvent the power of established finance, it’s hard to deny that the zeitgeist has shifted.

 **Trump Tweeting About Bitcoin Is ‘Achievement Unlocked,’ Says Coinbase CEO**
[ 
[Donald Trump]( saying he is not a fan of Bitcoin (BTC) and [cryptocurrency]( is “yuge” for the industry, commentators were suggesting after [new tweets]( on July 12.
In the hours after the [United States’]( president delivered his lackluster appraisal of crypto, the Bitcoin price stayed stable, only to then begin growing to [hit 1% gains]( Friday. 
Negative or not, for proponents, the event marked a psychological milestone for Bitcoin, as Trump had previously held off from mentioning it in public. 
The fact that he felt the need to bash Bitcoin publicly feeds the narrative that it is both independent of global powers and unable to be crushed by them, [Coinbase]( CEO [Brian Armstrong]( [leading the responses](
“Achievement unlocked! I dreamt about a sitting U.S. president needing to respond to growing cryptocurrency usage years ago. ‘First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.’ We just made it to step 3 y'all,” he tweeted.
Armstrong exemplified the buoyant mood among Bitcoiners. Others likewise [thanked]( Trump for the free publicity, noting a surge in interest documented by Google Trends, while the president being wrong in his opinion also became a talking point on social media. 
“Congratulations BTC community — the president of the United States feels we are worthy of a tweet now,” cryptocurrency entrepreneur, Simon Dixon, [added]( “Bitcoin has outperformed USD by 23,440,508% since it started being priced in USD.” 
[Max Keiser]( the RT host and regular Bitcoin bull, [considered]( Trump to have nullified his chances of reelection in 2020, while eToro senior analyst, Mati Greenspan, [described]( his words as an “early nomination for the most bullish tweet of the year.” 
Despite the conversely more stable price performance since the tweets, the possibility of a ‘Trump pump’ occurring for Bitcoin was also [gaining traction]( among analysts.
“Trump is bullish for Bitcoin generally because his media tactics wobble geo-political uncertainty. Thanks for all the dollars flowing into Bitcoin,” cryptographer and Hashcash inventor, [Adam Back]( [added](

Hackers Are Turning Binance’s Stolen Bitcoin Into Other Cryptocurrencies
[ 
 
A new analysis by [Coinfirm]( shows the movement of the bitcoin stolen from [Binance]( into various wallets. The hack, which netted 7,000 BTC, happened on May 7, 2019 at 17:15:24 UTC and the hackers have been moving stolen bitcoin from wallet to wallet.
Now, however, Coinfirm has spotted some activity that suggests the hackers are moving their gains off of exchanges, potentially into other cryptocurrencies.
The first transaction happened [here]( while other transactions followed. Most recently, however, it’s become clear that the hacker has begun liquidating the BTC on various exchanges.
 
“Analysis of one of the mainchains used by the hacker in layering stolen funds shows that they were able to liquidate at least 1.8087 BTC (21,000.00 USD) on the following exchanges,” said Coinfirm’s Grant Blaisdell. The transfers happened as follows:


Binance: 0,4294 BTC  
Bitmex: 0,0022 BTC  
KuCoin: 0,0713 BTC  
Kuna: 0,2482 BTC  
Bitmarket: 0,2560 BTC  
Crypterra: 0,0072 BTC  
Bitcoin.de: 0,0007 BTC  
WazirX: 0,0003 BTC
While caveats apply, it’s clear that the hacker moved an amount of BTC to each of these exchanges and there they either left the chain or remained dormant. This is obviously cold comfort to those who are watching their stolen crypto hop from exchange to exchange.
**How can they sell this stolen crypto on exchanges?  I thought the exchange would need really strong proof of how they acquired the Bitcoins in the first place?**
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:44:57

What is a Golden Cross?
The golden cross is a candlestick pattern that is a bullish signal in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The golden cross is a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average (such as the 15-day moving average) breaking above its long-term moving average (such as the 50-day moving average) or resistance level. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes.

**Rising Institutional Investment Setting Pace For Future Crypto Growth**
 [ 
 
Financial institutions have begun to enter crypto with a quickening pace, setting the tone for the remainder of 2019 and 2020.
What makes these years different from ones prior is the speed of professionalization taking place in the markets, according to our sources.
Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of BCB – a financial services group with digital asset specialism, drew comparisons on the various bull runs experienced over bitcoin’s (BTC) lifecycle, with the exception given to this year’s fundamental growth.


Last month in the UK alone, 9 financial institutions for banking and over-the-counter (OTC) trading were brought into the fold by BCB. That raised the count to 32, most of whom came onboard this year, says Landsberg-Sadie.


 On the horizon
Indeed, crypto has been experiencing some of the largest levels of institutional growth as seen with bitcoin [futures]( open interest and volume as well as a number of established banks issuing their own cryptocurrencies on their private blockchains.
In addition, these financial institutions are supporting a variety of blockchain projects focused on commodity trade finance and shipping, says Kari S. Larsen, a partner at Perkins Coie’s Blockchain Technology &amp; Digital Currency group based in New York.


Institutional investors rely heavily on regulated products and processes, organizations rely on steady progress on the regulatory front as well as infrastructure improvements, which directly affects the pace of institutional involvement.
However, the pace from financial regulators, at least in the US and parts of the EU, when it comes to providing guidance and licenses for entities seeking to focus on digital assets, has been very slow.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), for example, appears to be moving very slowly with broker-dealer applications from companies seeking to provide services supporting security tokens or related crypto products says Larsen.
Although, that is beginning to change mostly due to Facebook’s recent announcement on entering into crypto and the subsequent pushback from regulators on a global scale.
This has been reflected in BTC’s violent price swings in recent weeks, amplifying the discussion amongst regulators about what must be done about that ‘crypto issue’.
 Setting the Stage
Facebook’s battle with [regulators]( is sure to set the stage for crypto moving forward as the nuts and bolts of the regulatory framework are metered out.
With the potential advantage of on-ramping billions of users to digital assets through its Libra/BTC pairing, it can be argued that crypto poses a threat to traditional finance in a number of ways.
Therefore the time has come to tread carefully as over-regulation could put an immediate stop to bullish advances reflected in BTC’s latest price swings. Peaking at $13,880 on June 26 during a strong uptrend, BTC fell to a low of $9,950 before shooting back up to where it currently stands at $10,550.
Still, progress continues as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the United States’ regulatory agency with jurisdiction over futures markets, grants ErisX Clearing a derivative clearing organization (DCO) [license]( under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).
Rules and regulations take time to hash out but eventually the goal is to arrive at a happy medium that provides a stable platform to trade digital assets while encouraging fair trade and reducing risk.
There is a level of finesse when it comes to new markets as regulators scramble to make sense of crypto and how that fits into the current global financial model. The key here is to let the golden goose run free, careful not to implement too many restrictions while also reaping the benefits.
 Month-to-month market capitalization
��   
The monthly chart above reveals interesting insights into the total market cap experienced by the industry as of late, demonstrating its overall recovery which is nearing 50 percent retracement from the 2018 bear market and made headway amid another strong weekly showing in the form of large buy orders during June 1-June 30, suggesting these moves involve more than just the average trader.
A resurgence began on February 1 of this year when the total value closed above $130 billion for the first time in over two months, marking a strong shift in sentiment and trend with a hint of institutional interest.
Since then, the upward trajectory has been checked by steady increases in growing (bullish) volume seen by the large bars on the monthly chart, backing the trend.
Now above $300 billion, growth seems very plausible, given crypto’s recent bullish fundamentals, however, that will also depend largely on how the industry navigates the upcoming regulatory framework.

**Golden Cross Provides Glimmer of Hope for Bitcoin Price Revival**
* ***Bitcoin’s three-day chart is reporting a golden cross, a long-term bull market indicator, for the first time since February 2016. A similar crossover seen six months ahead of the August 2016 mining reward halving paved way for a mega bull run.***
* History may repeat itself with mining reward halving due in less than 12 months.
* BTC may rise back to $10,000 in the next 24 hours or so with short duration charts signaling seller exhaustion.
* A UTC close above $11,120 is needed to revive the bullish view. On the downside, key support is seen at $9,049 (July 17 low).
Bitcoin’s (BTC) bulls have reason to be optimistic despite the recent 33 percent price drop, as a long-term technical indicator has turned bullish.
The 50-candle price average has crossed above the 200-candle average on the three-day chart, confirming a golden cross – a bull market indicator. That is the first such crossover on the three-day chart since Feb. 3, 2016, according to Bitstamp data.
That long-term moving average crossovers are lagging indicators and have limited predictive powers at best is widely known. So, seasoned traders may consider the latest cross as a product of BTC’s rally from December’s low of $3,122 to June’s high of $13,880. After all, MAs follow price and, the longer the time-frame of the MA, the bigger the lag.
Even so, the bulls can take heart from the golden cross, which has proved its mettle as a reliable indicator in the past, [as discussed]( earlier this month.
Bitcoin witnessed a golden cross in the three days to Feb. 3, 2016 – six months ahead of the mining reward halving – following which the cryptocurrency charted its way to a record high of $20,000 by December 2017.
With another reward halving (effectively, a supply cut) due in less than 12 months, history may just repeat itself.
As of writing , BTC is changing hands at $9,500 on Bitstamp, down 31.55 percent from June’s high of $13,880. The cryptocurrency could rise to $10,000 in the next 24 hours, according to the short-duration technical charts.
The long-tailed doji seen on the 4-hour chart reflects the fact that sellers failed to keep prices at lows near $9,100 on July 28, with buyers pushing prices all the way back to $9,500.
The candle widely considered a sign of seller exhaustion, more so since it has appeared following a more than 30-percent decline from June’s high of $13,880.
A bearish lower-highs pattern, as represented by the falling trendline, is intact. The 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are also trending south.
The 14-day relative strength index is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print. The indicator, however, is now flatlining, indicating a weakening of bearish momentum.
More importantly, dips to or below $9,400 have been consistently short-lived since July 16, also a sign of seller exhaustion.
As a result, a rise back to $10,000 in the next 24 hours cannot be ruled out. That said, a bull revival would require a UTC close above the bearish lower high of $11,120 created on July 20.

 **Bitcoin, Facebook and the End of 20th Century Money**
 [ 
There is never a dull moment in the world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies.
The two earth-shattering stories of the past two weeks – the [launch of the Libra project]( and the [wild swings in the bitcoin market ]( – might seem like unrelated topics. And, for the most part, the causal impact of the former on the latter is probably not much greater than that of another oft-noted bitcoin price correlation: [the avocado chart](
However, the coincidence of these two developments does speak to how globally impactful Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention has now become.
From that wider perspective, these two developments are not at all unrelated. Indeed, they both capture elements of a massive, worldwide financial transformation, all happening at a time of growing economic uncertainty.
 Bitcoin’s role as ‘digital gold’
Whether now or in the future, I believe the arrival of Libra, far from being a competitive threat, will be extremely supportive of bitcoin.
Not only will the looming international debate over Libra elevate the conversation around cryptocurrencies and so draw more people into the most established of them, it also represents a major step toward the kind of world in which bitcoin should thrive.
Whether or not Libra succeeds, it confirms the inescapable reality that international money movements in the digital era will be based on blockchain-like solutions that disintermediate the existing gatekeepers and challenge the bank-and-sovereign money-dominated model of the 20th century. It also underscores how we are moving into an age of digital assets.
And, just as people sought out physical assets to protect their wealth from the vulnerabilities of the analog era’s trust-dependent system – by storing value in gold, for example, or in real estate – they will now seek out similar protection in digital assets with similar properties. Bitcoin is not described as “digital gold” for nothing; it offers a level of censorship resistance and isolation from the politicization of money that the corporate-driven Libra project cannot.
I see mainstream global money movements in the next decade or so flowing through a mix of blockchain-era stable-money services that operate along a centralization-to-decentralization spectrum — from [JPMorgan’s JPM Coin]( and the [new Swift blockchain project]( at one end to Libra and more open-standard crypto stablecoin projects such as [CENTRE’s USDC ]( at the other. But as those grow in usage, the demand for bitcoin as the digital asset hedge of choice will also grow.
So, regardless of whether or not there is a causal relationship, the Libra announcement offers important context for the continued, accelerating demand for bitcoin, the surge of buying that saw it rally from around $7,000 on June 10 to a peak just below $14,000 on Thursday last week.
 A backdrop of global economic uncertainty
This wider transition in the world’s money paradigm adds a dynamic new variable to what may be a serious global economic downturn. As with previous periods of global economic tensions, the current dicey state of U.S.-China trade relations is directly impacting monetary conditions and policy expectations. But this time it’s happening at a time when cryptocurrencies and blockchains are looking like an alternative vehicle for people to manage the risks they face in this deteriorating environment.
The trade war between the U.S. and China has spooked businesses and investors the world over, resulting in a surge of demand for traditional safe-haven assets. A flood of demand into long-dated bonds has driven down their yields and led to [an inversion in the U.S. Treasury yield]( curve – a market scenario that Wall Street has traditionally viewed as a harbinger of recession.
That, in turn, has stoked expectations of monetary easing by central banks, most likely led by the [European Central Bank, whose President, Mario Draghi, last week signaled the strong possibility of stimulus. ]( Recalling the trillions of dollars, euros and yen that were added to the world’s base money levels during the “quantitative easing” era that accompanied and followed the global financial crisis and European debt crisis within the past decade, investors have once again started buying inflation hedges. And this time, it’s not just the traditional version (gold, up almost 10% in June); it’s also the new one (bitcoin, up almost 40%).
 Chinese capital flight
More specifically, there is talk of capital flight out of China and Hong Kong, a pattern of behavior that naturally boosts interest in bitcoin if not outright demand.
China’s balance of payments is showing [a very large “errors and omissions” component]( traditionally an informal measure of how much renminbi is escaping through unofficial channels to bypass the limits that Beijing imposes on its citizens’ purchases of foreign currency. Almost certainly, this is in part driven by Chinese manufacturers seeking to move their production operations offshore, to places such as Taiwan, to bypass the U.S. tariffs. (Their ability to do so is more evidence of why this is such a harmful, ham-fisted policy by the Trump administration.)
But it’s also likely coming from wealthy Chinese businesses and individuals who are simply looking to protect their funds in an uncertain environment, a group that these days includes bitcoin miners.
Meanwhile, the massive protests in Hong Kong, stoked by concerns about encroaching judicial oversight by the Chinese mainland, have also stirred talk that the territory’s business class will move funds offshore.
The bulk of that flight capital will go into dollars. But if even a small part of it, spooked by the prospects of more quantitative easing from central banks, goes into bitcoin, it can have an outsized impact on the price of the cryptocurrency. Certainly, volumes seen on the more data-reliable crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase’s, have shown surging demand.
The wider point, however, is that the new round of global economic uncertainty is occurring at the same time that cryptocurrency and blockchains are establishing themselves as key elements of the emerging financial architecture of the world.
In the financial crisis of 2008, nobody other than the small number of names on the cypherpunk mailing list to which Satoshi posted his white paper on Oct. 31 of that year had any idea that this alternative model for the global finance existed. Now cryptocurrencies and blockchain are high of mind among banks, global companies and regulators – with Libra, as I mentioned, playing no small role in elevating the technology’s profile.
I hate to say it, but maybe this time *is* different.

No but I do think about why I didn't invest $10k when it was under $100.

If someone wants to take a short position, then someone has to take a long position to cover it.  The futures exchange is like the middle man and they just take their fee.  They make money by being the middle man.

**Pantera CEO: $42,000 Bitcoin Price By The End Of 2019 'A Good Shot'**
 [ 
 
[In a recent episode of her Unchained podcast]( Laura Shin interviewed Dan Morehead and Joey Krug of Pantera Capital, which is a cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused investment fund that was founded in 2013.
During the interview, Morehead commented on the potential future trajectory of the bitcoin price in response to a question related to where the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry is today in its overall life cycle. In his reply, Morehead pointed to a potential price move to $356,000 within three years based on past trends of Bitcoin’s price movements on a logarithmic scale.
Morehead’s math also indicated that a $42,000 bitcoin price by the end of 2019 is in the cards. It should be noted that crypto prime dealer SFOX also recently released a research note [that could indicate a bullish move for Bitcoin]( during the holiday season later this year. Additionally, digital asset research firm Delphi digital recently released a report that [showed how]( retail investor enthusiasm around Bitcoin has returned in 2019.

Is the "energy consumption" in mining a problem? Mining is a business of arbitrage for the cheapest sources of electricity. Proof-of-work mining is contributing to massive investment and subsidy in renewables / alternative energy and efficiency improvements in processing.  It is driving the decentralization of energy production. "Consumption" in Bitcoin is easy to criticize because it is obvious, whereas the hidden externalities of the traditional financial system are massive.

In 2015, a proposal for the Lightning Network described a caching layer for Bitcoin, where simple payment channels could support off-chain transactions, which would decrease fees, increase speed, improve scalability, and further decentralizing Bitcoin transactions. Following SegWit’s malleability fix for Bitcoin, the implementers of the Lightning Network protocol have announced an exciting milestone today: the first release candidate of version 1.0 of the Lightning protocol specification.
This is the capstone of a year spent standardizing the implementations created by the three teams working on the Lightning Network—ACINQ, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs—with input from other members of the Bitcoin community. Recently the teams verified our interoperability, which is crucial to the creation of a single, unified Lightning Network where payments are seamlessly routed. To do so, we collaborated to conduct the world’s first mainnet Lightning transactions using all three Lightning implementations.
Learn more about the tests and this milestone in the joint announcement by the developers of eclair (ACINQ), c-lightning (Blockstream), and lnd (Lightning Labs), and provide your feedback and peer review on the Lightning release candidate specification.

FUDing will continue to go on but I am worried that it is getting difficult to discuss certain issues on this forum.  I am 100% behind Bitcoin but sometimes posts get removed when there is good/decent issues being discussed.

Cash Settlement is a method of settling forward contracts or futures contracts by cash rather than by physical delivery of the underlying asset. The parties settle by paying/receiving the loss/gain related to the contract in cash when the contract expires.
In forward or future contracts, the buyer agrees to purchase some asset in the future at a price agreed upon today. In physically settled forward and future contracts, the full purchase price is paid by the buyer, and the actual asset is delivered by the seller. For example: Company A enters into a forward contract to buy 1 million barrels of oil at $70/barrel from company B on a future date. On that future date, Company A would have to pay $70 million to company B and in exchange receive 1 million barrels of oil.
However, if the contract was cash-settled, the buyer and the seller would simply exchange the difference in the associated cash positions. The cash position is the difference between the spot price of the asset on the settlement date and the agreed upon price as dictated by the forward/future contract. Continuing from the example above, if on the settlement date the price of oil was $50 per barrel, the buyer, instead of paying the seller $70 million, would pay him $20 million. This is the difference between the price of 1 million barrels on that day and the agreed upon price -- and the seller would not deliver any oil to the buyer. If, on the other hand, the price of oil was $80 per barrel, the seller would pay the buyer $10 million in cash and deliver no oil.
It may seem confusing as to why the cash position is the difference between the spot price at settlement and the agreed upon forward/futures price. Using the example above again, consider if the spot price of oil was $50 per barrel, and the contract were physically settled. It would pay the seller $70 million, and received 1 million barrels in return. However, the market value of the oil is only $50 per barrel, meaning it paid more than the spot (market) price for oil. In other words, if Company A were to sell the oil immediately after it received the oil, it would only receive $50 million, incurring a loss of $20 million. The same principle holds true if the spot price of oil is $80 per barrel at expiry; rather than having a loss, Company A now has a profit.
Why do parties use cash settlement?
Cash settlement is useful and often preferred because it eliminates much of the transaction costs that would otherwise be incurred when physically delivering a good. For example, a futures contract on a basket of stocks such as the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) will always be cash settled because of the inconvenience, impracticality, and extremely high transaction costs associated with delivering shares of all 500 companies. Because the costs associated with cash settled contracts are lower, it appeals to both hedgers and speculators.
Cash settlement also helps reduce credit risk for futures contracts. When entering into a futures contract, each party must deposit money into a margin account where gains and losses are paid into or taken out of. Futures contracts are cash settled daily and gains/losses are received/paid each day, eliminating the chance that a party will be unable to pay.
Most forwards and futures on financial assets are cash settled. For instance, forward rate agreements, which are forward contracts on an interest rate, are always cash settled because the underlying is an interest rate, which is not physically deliverable. Commodities, while often physically settled, can also be cash settled as long as an observable, undisputed measure of the spot price is agreed upon beforehand. Cash settling commodities lets companies reduce the cost of hedging
How does cash settlement work?
A quick example would help illustrate the point. Assume Company Z, an airline company, purchases its fuel from local, familiar dealers, but wishes to hedge against rising fuel costs. It buys (take the long position) a futures contract at the price of $50 per barrel to lock in its purchase price. However, it has a long established relationship with local suppliers, and it would prefer to continue purchasing from its established suppliers rather than receive the fuel from the seller of the futures contract.
If the futures contract was physically settled, at expiry Company Z would pay the previously agreed upon futures price, and receive the actual fuel from the seller regardless of the spot price (current market price). If the spot price was $75 a barrel, Company Z has a profit of $25 per barrel, since it pays only $50 per barrel rather than $75. If the spot price was $25 a barrel, Company Z has a loss of $25 a barrel because it must pay $50 a barrel when it could have only paid $25 had it not entered into the contract. By entering into the futures contract, Company Z locks in its purchase price of fuel, effectively removing any uncertainty about the cost of the fuel.
However, if the contract was cash settled, Company Z would receive the difference in cash between the spot price and the futures price. If the spot price at expiry is $75, Company Z has again earned a profit of $25 per barrel. This is because it only needs to pay $50 per barrel, but can immediately sell it for $75, turning a $25 immediate profit. This is where the convenience of cash settlement makes it desirable. Rather than paying $50 per barrel and receiving the actual fuel, in a cash settled contract the seller of the contract would simply pay Company Z $25, or the difference between the spot and futures price. This allows Company Z to then purchase fuel from its established supplier at the spot (market) price of $75. Since it received the $25 per barrel from the seller of the futures contract, the final net cost to Company Z remains $50 per barrel.
If the spot price were to decrease to $25 per barrel, then Company Z has a loss (since it could buy fuel in the open market for $25, but has locked in the purchase price at $50) and must pay the seller $25. However, despite the loss, it can now buy fuel at the spot price of $25 per barrel, and thus again the total cost is $50 per barrel.

OP - I was going to post something like what you have today.  I just don't understand the people here that seem to love it when Bitcoin takes a dip, it's like they are waiting all day for the price to drop.

**Bitcoin’s Price Charts Point to an Impending ‘Golden Cross’**
[ 
 
A bitcoin price indicator is about to turn bullish for the first time since the early stages of the 2016-17 bull market.
The 50-candle moving average (MA) on bitcoin’s three-day chart is in a solid upward trajectory and looks set to cross above the 200-candle MA in the next few days.
That would be the first golden crossover on the three-day chart since early February 2016. CoinDesk reported on a golden cross for bitcoin’s daily chart back in April.
Seasoned traders often refer to that long-term bull market signal as a lagging indicator. After all, the MA studies are based on historical data and tend to lag prices, which also means they have limited predictive abilities at best.
While that is true for most crossovers, the one that is about to happen on the three-day chart has proved its mettle as a reliable bull market indicator in the past.

The run-up in bitcoin and other crypto assets has offered cynics of all stripes a chance to look smart by condemning cryptocurrency as a "Ponzi scheme" that could "cause a recession.”
These arguments are not new, but they are ignorant.
It is time that we stop allowing people who do not understand (or simply ignore) the truth to comment on this market as if they know something us greater fools simply cannot see.
Ponzi scheme
People who don’t like bitcoin try to call it a Ponzi scheme or a fraud because then they no longer have to discuss its merits. Jamie Dimon does this.
This week, Bert Ely did it too. His opinion piece in The Hill is subtly titled, "Bitcoin is a Ponzi Scheme and Will Collapse like One."
Unfortunately, these same people have never looked up the definition of "Ponzi scheme" or "fraud" because, even if bitcoin will fail or result in investors losing all their money, it does not meet the definition of either a Ponzi scheme or a fraud.
Ely's big claim is that bitcoin "will stay afloat only as long as enough people buy the fiction that bitcoin  represents real value." He neglects to say how this is any different than the U.S. dollar or the Venezuelan Bolivar. His central thesis relies on the basic premise of ANY medium of exchange: it only works as long as people will accept it for goods and services.
Even if we let Ely simply change the definition of a Ponzi scheme to fit his argument or ignore the fact that we can buy things like sheets, toasters and tennis shoes with bitcoin, he is simply defining ALL currencies. Nobody accepts dollars because they like green-colored paper, and the idea that government or an army can compel confidence in currency is utterly naïve.
It is also proven false by the Venezuelan bolivar, the German mark and the Zimbabwean dollar. Once we realize this, it is fun to read the rest of Ely's article.
For example, let's edit a passage from Ely to fit the analysis above:
"All Ponzi schemes eventually collapse, of course, when sufficient amounts can no longer be raised from new investors to pay off earlier investors. The same will occur with [the U.S. dollar and the Venezuelan bolivar]. …. Investors will pull back from buying [dollars and bolivars] causing their prices to begin a sustained decline. This overdue disaster will occur because all [U.S. dollars and Venezuelan bolivars] have no intrinsic value."
At this point, I considered adding a BTC/USD price chart over the past couple of years to demonstrate the truth of Ely's statement (as edited).
However, I nixed that in favor of my second favorite passage: Ely's conclusion (also edited) where he promises that "[U.S. Dollars and Venezuelan Bolivars] and the like will quickly fade into financial history, just as tulipmania [and the German mark, the Argentinian peso and the Zimbabwean dollar] did, serving solely to remind future generations of the folly of gambling on illusions of value [like fiat currency]."
I am sure that Ely will say I took his argument out of context and I definitely added a lot of commentary in the passages above, but if his baseline premise is really that bitcoin has no intrinsic value, this is exactly what he is saying about dollars, bolivars and every other fiat currency.
Contagion and market collapse
The new argument from the financial establishment this week comes from the start of trading bitcoin futures at the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE).
It goes something like this: "We have to care about this crazy bitcoin bubble because, now that futures are trading, a price collapse could trigger a recession."
In his piece for Business Insider thoughtfully titled “Now There is A Way for Contagion from a Bitcoin Price Collapse to Flow into the Rest of the Markets,” Jim Edwards argues that “An asset’s value comes from the fact that its market is liquid.”
This is smarter than Ely's "no intrinsic value" argument, but then Edwards stops taking us seriously and notes with alarm that a pub in London and gaming company Steam will no longer accept bitcoin as payment. He goes on to extrapolate from those facts that bitcoin might lose its liquidity and become an asset bubble that could burst.
Now he is beginning to sound more like Ely.
Edwards does not mention that Overstock.com (which owns my company, Medici Ventures) has seen the variety and amount of its bitcoin sales more than double over the past year or that payment processing companies like Bitt, Square and Spera are actively working to allow customers to pay for virtually anything at any merchant in bitcoin without any requirement from the merchant to receive or hold cryptocurrencies.
That kind of liquidity is nearly as good as the liquidity of dollars. In the case of international payments, it may be better.
Edwards also conveniently ignores the incredible variety of crypto assets that any bitcoin holder can purchase on cryptocurrency exchanges. His final point that the bitcoin market has never been tested by futures trading is also true but does not mention the most important aspect of bitcoin futures: There is no direct link between the bitcoin market and the futures market, which is cash-settled.
It is ironic that speculative bets denominated in dollars that will never, ever be settled in bitcoin are now the reason that we must be concerned about the price of bitcoin.
There will never be a short squeeze. There will never be failures to deliver on short sales. This is not even a real futures market as we know it, because no contract will ever be fulfilled or settled in the actual currency/commodity that is subject to the contract.
So, the danger isn't bitcoin itself or any of the people who use bitcoin. It is the speculators on Wall Street making enormous long and short bets on what will happen to the bitcoin price.
Instead of worrying about how dangerous bitcoin is for the economy, perhaps we should be asking why we want to let Wall Street bet billions every day on whether bitcoin’s price will go up or down and how much they will try to manipulate the bitcoin market to make sure they win in futures trading.
If there is a systemic risk, it is in the derivatives market, not bitcoin.

Yeah I know that the price could not keep increasing the way it was but still for it to have got to around $19.5k and now to be around $13k.  Would be good to hear from people more intelligent then me as to why the market thinks it's worth $6k less now.

I have to agree that the level of support on a lot of these sites is very poor although I guess the increases in volume of users is very substantial so you can see that it's hard for them to catch up.
Not many people thought there would be hundreds of thousands of people signing up per day in some cases.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:05:09
I actually think that it's good news as it shows the government are fully aware of it and realise that it's here to stay.

Act I: Bye bye China
2017's epic cryptocurrency rally may seem sudden. It's not.
To understand where we went, we have to go back all the way to August 2015, when the PBOC conducted a shock devaluation of the yuan. Imminent fears of more currency debasement prompted Chinese bitcoin punters to break the cryptocurrency out of its $200-to-$300 prison.
By 1 Jan. 2017, bitcoin rose 5x to $1,000.
Unknowingly priming the market were yuan bears who dominated the news with forecasts of a mega-devaluation before Chinese New Year, and Chinese savers fearful of currency debasement continued to purchase bitcoin as a hedge. This narrative framed the bullish case for bitcoin.
At the time, the vast majority of all trading volume remained on the big three Chinese exchanges (OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC).
Then the PBOC struck. Just as it had in Dec. 2013, the PBOC reminded the world that bitcoin was risky. There was talk of inspections by government authorities into the operations of the largest exchanges. Next, the PBOC banned margin trading, the bread-and-butter exchange profit engine.
The rally turned quickly into an aggressive bear raid, chopping close to 30 percent off the price.
However, unlike 2013, bitcoin in 2017 proved a different animal. In under one week, the price completely retraced and continued to march higher. The PBOC reached for their FUD playbook and announced that the major exchanges violated KYC/AML rules and must now submit to rigorous government inspections.
The price tanked once more but less violently. Again after a few days, a complete retrace occurred, and bitcoin made new highs. Frustrated, the PBOC decreed that bitcoin withdrawals were now halted. At this point, the Chinese exchanges lost all relevance to the price of bitcoin.
The market took this negative news in stride and continued higher.
The bull market baton shifted from China to Japan and South Korea. The Japanese government regulated the market and provided a sensible regulatory regime for exchanges to operate under. South Koreans took to bitcoin as they had other digital assets, and local exchanges rose to dominate global trading volumes.
Act II: IC-what?
But just while the North Asia bitcoin melodrama played out, the ICO craze intensified.
Project after project, even those with questionable underlying value, raised gargantuan sums of money. Bancor, BAT and Status were some of the hottest deals in 2017. With ether up over 30x from the start of the year, upcoming mega-deals such as Tezos, EOS and Filecoin gained masonic status.
And the value proposition was easy enough to understand. ICOs purported to shift the balance of power away from gentil VC gatekeepers, and allow the plebs to fund the technology of tomorrow.
As ICOs raised more capital, the Chinese government curiously allowed the exchanges to re-enable bitcoin withdrawals. That set the ICO market on fire. Now the world's greatest punters could exchange RMB for bitcoin and ether, and then purchase any ICO.
The race was on to issue ICOs aimed at the Chinese, Korean and Japanese markets.
The hunger of the proles to place their economic future in anything other than overpriced stocks and property allowed deals to raise god-like sums of money.
Act III: Back to bitcoin
As the summer waned, the scaling debate hit a fever pitch. The big and small blockers organized successive games of chicken to force the community to finally decide how bitcoin would scale.
The first game was the user-activated soft fork (UASF). The Bitcoin Core acolytes pushed forward a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that if SegWit was not activated by Aug. 1st, a possible chain split would occur. Exchanges, miners and holders were scared shitless of the consequences of a chain split.
In desperation, the miners came together under the New York Agreement and enacted a face-saving measure to activate SegWit, and a possible hard fork to a 2 MB block size in Q4 2017.
At the last minute, a group of big blockers proposed a bitcoin hard fork to an 8 MB block. This was the birth of bitcoin cash and the start of the bitcoin-fork-o-rama.
Bitcoin cash (or bcash) emerged with a non-zero value, and exchange after exchange listed the altcoin. Some miners continued to support it for pure ideological reasons, and the pump and dump team kept the volatility high to entertain traders.
Still, something unexpected happened. Bitcoin hard forked, and both chains survived. The price dipped down to $3,000 but quickly rebounded and made higher highs.
Act IV: Regulators mount up
Back in ICO-land, the craze continued even as many governments attempted to pour cold water on the concept. Countless alphabet-letter regulatory agencies around the globe beat the drum that ICOs were volatile, of questionable value and possibly operating in violation of securities laws.
However, the punters ignored the brahmins and continued to invest.
China decided it had had enough, effectively declaring that its citizens should not be able to escape the equity and property markets. In the run up to the National Congress, bitcoin's potential threat to societal harmony was deemed too great to avoid a good stamping out. As a result, the PBOC decreed ICO fundraising illegal, and shut down all cryptocurrency exchanges in China.
The market sighed, but continued higher. Bitcoin inexorably marched towards $10,000.
Act V: ShitCoin2x
The next obstacle was the SegWit2x hard fork.
The signers of the New York Agreement were steadfast that bitcoin should be upgraded to a 2 MB block with SegWit. However, many were perplexed why such a hard fork was needed. Surely those who wanted big blocks could purchase bcash?
The SegWit2x proponents did not heed calls for replay protection, which meant that if the hard fork happened, it might be contentious. Exchange after exchange clarified and re-clarified what they would call the "real" bitcoin.
In the end, vocal community stakeholders, myself included, called SegWit2x what it really was, a shitcoin.
At the last minute, the miners, exchanges and community leaders supporting SegWit2x dropped their support. It died an inglorious death days before the scheduled hard fork.
Act V: CME goes all-in
It was pump time for bitcoin.
As bitcoin hovered around $7,000, the community wondered what would take us to the $10,000 promised land. Then, CME Group, one of the largest derivatives exchanges in the world, announced it would list a US-dollar denominated bitcoin futures contract. That set the market on fire.
In the next few weeks, the market screamed higher and surpassed $10,000. That is where we stand now.
After hard forks, and governments attempting to stifle the rise of bitcoin, the largest exchanges in the world (the CME, the CBOE and Nasdaq) blessed bitcoin as a real asset.
The moral of 2017: BTFD!

Bitcoin continued its rollercoaster ride on Friday, hitting a new high above $17,000 (£12,615) before falling.
The digital currency slid as low as $13,963, according to Coindesk.com, before rallying again to trade at about $15,600 on Friday afternoon.
Bitcoin has soared about 70% this week, with its dramatic rise being likened to a "charging train with no brakes".
As concerns mount, an industry group has warned plans to start Bitcoin futures trading have been "rushed".
Critics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, but others argue it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream.
"Bitcoin now seems like a charging train with no brakes," said Shane Chanel, from Sydney-based ASR Wealth Advisers.
Nigel Green, of financial consultancy deVere Group, said he expected Bitcoin to see-saw in coming weeks.
"Today's digital world needs crypto-currencies. One or two of the existing ones will succeed. Whether it's Bitcoin or not remains to be seen," he added.
The surging price of Bitcoin has been helped by the start of trading on the Chicago-based Cboe Futures Exchange on Sunday. The world's largest futures exchange, CME, will begin its Bitcoin offering a week later.
Trading on futures exchanges allows investors to buy and sell contracts for the crypto-currency at a certain point in the future at an agreed price.
But the Futures Industry Association, which includes Wall Street's largest banks, brokers and traders, has written to the US regulator over concerns that the contracts were approved "without properly weighing the risks".
"A more thorough and considered process would have allowed for a robust public discussion among clearing member firms, exchanges and clearing houses," the association said.
While Goldman Sachs is a member of the association, it is also one of the banks that will work as an intermediary to help clear Bitcoin futures contracts for some clients.
A spokeswoman for the investment bank said it was evaluating the risks as part of its due diligence process.
Many big investors have been reluctant to pile into the crypto-currency market unless it is regulated.
However, the prospect of a Bitcoin futures market has raised hopes that it will be regarded as sufficiently "regulated".
'Major gamble'
While Bitcoin has become more mainstream in recent weeks, many observers warn the market could be a bubble waiting to pop.
Mr Green added: "Bitcoin remains a major gamble as it is very much an asset that remains in uncharted waters... an asset that goes almost vertically up should typically raise alarm bells for investors."
Even a crash or a major correction is unlikely to pose risks to the global economy, some analysts say.
While billions of dollars have been invested in Bitcoin, its $268bn total market value is still small compared to other asset classes.

I think they should have increased the block size as well until they had LN working properly.  So much damage has been done to Bitcoin's reputation with the constant back log in transactions &amp; high fees.  The huge increase in popularity was the chance to show all these new people that Bitcoin was number1, instead they have seen that it's slow with high fees.  I really hope that not too much damage has been done.  I want Bitcoin to succeed but they could have managed it so much better.

I don't understand what you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:37:48
It might be in some peoples interests to keep the price below a certain level, maybe for the position they have on futures. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:51:19
Atleast you are in.  I can't understand why they have not released some sort of update message on social media.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:56:35
:) Well said.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:28:22
Why say that he sold them then? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:20:06
I think yes but I don't know for sure.  Maybe start a thread and someone with answer you. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:35:30
What proof have you of any of this?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:46:31
Nice  :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:20
I totally agree about this is Bitcoin going mainstream.  I really hope you are right about it being worth $1million in 5 years :)
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:28:45
There is not enough Bitcoin for every millionaire on the planet to own a whole coin.  That fact always makes me think.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:55:39
That $14k wall went down in a minute or less!
That was mental! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:21:16
Can't say I have :) 
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:52:38
Enlighten me :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:43:47
Yep, this cycle repeats all the time :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:17:28
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:46:03
You will own the same percentage of a BTC. 
It's BTC not BC. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:18:16
Nice username :) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:43:24
Yep, a lot of people predicted this. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 17:57:50
:) 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:41:28
Cool  :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:32:02
This news needs to be spread around.  This imo is actually very, very good news. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:19:04
We appreciate what you do, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:14
I'm not sure but this is like the wild west and anything goes at times.

Welcome to the show :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:46:27
That would not surprise me at all.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:06:03
There are some bad actors in this scene, we must ignore all the FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:14:55
Very nice message :) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:22:22
Mods delete this shit please.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:52:03
I agree with you up to a certain point, obviously things have gone far from smoothly but also I would like to think/hope that the vast majority realise that it's new and that there are always going to be growing pains. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:19:39
The people that have gone long will just be buying the cheaper Bitcoin if people start selling.  This will stabilise the price.  All this future trading will just mean the liquidity and volume in the market will increase.
Thinking the market will crash is non-sense.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:01:31
We need London to buy a lot today.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:06:56






@_date: 2017-12-22 16:34:13
What will the price stabalise at today? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:38:46
Welcome to the show.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:33:19
Yes I would.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:06:51
Could not agree more.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:21:54
That was a seriously huge amount!  Thousands of Bitcoins.
I think it must have been trying to trick the bots so he could buy cheaper.  They were never going to sell those imo.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:23:10
That is because most of the media companies are owned by people that don't want to change the Status Quo.  They want the system to remain the same so they can keep making money like they have for the last hundred or more years.  They will try every trick in the book to keep anything that threatens their system from possibly becoming the new system.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:15:14
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:09:12
Keep it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:33:29
You would think they could update Twitter or a message on their blog to tell us what is going on.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:55:25
Never too late. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:23:05
Welcome to the show. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:09:41
All the best.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:27:57
Please be patient and stick with the one and only Bitcoin, we admit this is a rough period but we are trying to achieve greatness by fair play and not by under hand tactics like BCash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:41:42
Good post. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:59:36
What's the point of starting threads all the time saying the same thing!?  Do you think there is one person out there that does not realise the fees are too high and they are taking too long!?  It's like me starting threads every day saying the Sun is Hot. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:45:25
Going by twitter this started happening about 20 hours ago, about 2 weeks this happened to me as well, could not log in for about 8 hours and then it started to work again.
Drives me mad that they can't release some sort of update on Twitter.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:41:02
Perfect!  :) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:37:57
What annoys me the most is that their support team don't even seem to know about this issue and it must have been reported to them many times over the last few hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:52:58
Perhaps they have suspended sales at the moment because there are so many transactions in the system at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:25:55
Is it not enough developers that have the right skills?
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:22:23
Are you the CEO of BetKing?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:22:08
It won't have any major effect on price at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:19:24
How long have you had this problem for?
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:45:54
In my opinion it's news that only a few people know about.  I am only guessing. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:21:09
I did find it a bit suspect that GDAX crashed the other day when the price was &gt;$18k
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:22:41
I think they are starting now.  6am in South Korea now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:50:55
How did you pay $19.2k when the highest it went was around $18.7k and that was for less then 30 seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:25:36
Very good video and very, very relevant to this forum!
**Focus on the technology and not on the drama (Reddit)**
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:07:58
This is actually good news, BCash won't be able to pump and dump as much hopefully.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:47:37
What country are you in?  It's just over $16k at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:35:54
This has been a very bad few days for all crypto imo, people are getting sick and tired of the politics and the people that want to be more important then this movement, namely Roger Ver.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:47:36
Glad it worked out for you.  I'm hoping we can stay above $13k today/tonight and then we have a chance.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:24:22
Why don't you try and start a discussion.

Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Definition
What is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)?
Dollar-Cost Averaging is a strategy that allows an investor to buy the same dollar amount of an investment on regular intervals. The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:42:09
I have to agree with this, I am finished with GDAX and coinbase! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:44:17
We have had major backlogs several times before.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:58:13
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:58:29
Ok  :) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:18:15
I know what you mean, part of me thinks we would be better of if the futures were never going to happen but I guess it might prove to be great news in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:51:49
Merry Christmas :) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:30:28
Where did you get this rubbish from?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:16:51
Totally agree.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:52:40
So many people in the same boat, wishing they had bought more or spent less. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:22:46
BUY, BUY, BUY   :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:21:10
Looks like something is happening, whether the OP guessed or not I don't care :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:42:02
Well said! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:35:00
Everyone knows the fees are too high and transactions are taking too long recently, there is nothing positive to be gained from complaining all the time though is there?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:13:57
That's futures.  That's not banning Bitcoin exchanges! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:07:41
Yep, us humans are funny creatures. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:23:20
All he does is negative for the crypto world.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:01:55
What's going to happen?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:10:11
People need to learn to be more patient, if you want something sent quickly you have to pay extra at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:01:28
I will take a guess and go for $28,000
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:02:38
**Up we go again!**

It's a problem at blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:13:00
Like clockwork! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:59:30
I think we all think that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:51:32
Check out this article...
Whats the problem?
The number of transactions per block in bitcoin is limited. As bitcoin became more popular, the number of transactions grew in the past years and created the problem that transactions took longer as the Bitcoin blocks were “full”. So you had two choices – either wait longer for your transaction to be processed – or pay a higher fee to get it processed faster.
We agree that this is an unpleasant situation which needs to be solved, but on the other hand it was also artificially created by “Spam transactions” on the Bitcoin blockchain to create that exact problem.
What is Bcash ( And why it is not to be called “Bitcoin Cash”)?
Bcash is a fork of Bitcoin which is essentially stealing the code and the brand name of the original Bitcoin, modifying the sourcecode a little to increase the blocksize to enable more transactions per block.
What sounds like a good idea is pretty crappy from a technical perspective and also the attempt of some people to take over control of Bitcoin. Here is why Bcash is a scam and only mentally underprivileged people call it “Bitcoin Cash”:
Bitcoin has a team of the smartest developers you can imagine – and most of them work voluntarily since years to make bitcoin better, more secure, keep it decentralized an bring important updates like segwit and off chain transactions to bitcoin to make it fit for the future as the internet of money.
Bcash instead has just few guys as developers (likely paid) which are pretty unknown in the bitcoin space who are trying to understand and modify the sourcecode of bitcoin for less than half a year. As you might know from your own profession – in less than half a year, you are very far from being a expert in anything.
Their “genius” solution to the problem of full blocks is: Making the blocks bigger. That´s about as smart as buying more and more harddrives instead of using some compression for files, like zip, mp3, mp4 or jpeg. If someone would sell that idea to you, wouldn´t that sound kind of stupid?
Yes it does. Why? Because it is.
To sum it up. Bcash is as much Bitcoin or “Bitcoin Cash” as taking a bottle of Coca Cola, empty half of the bottle and filling it up with salt water in order to make it less sweet. You can imagine how that Coke would taste – yes, pretty crappy just like a fake. You wouldn´t call that Coca Cola Light. Maybe you would call it Coca Cola Crap. You´d better not call it Coca Cola at all. That´s why Bcash should not to be called Bitcoin Cash.
 
So, where are the benefits of Bcash?
We did the research for you – and here are the pro´s and cons of Bcash.
 
Bcash makes transactions slightly faster and cheaper in the short term.
Goto 1. Sorry, that´s it.
 
Bcash needs more resources in terms of storage space for the Blockchain
Bcash needs more resources in terms of traffic for a full node
Bcash is controlled by people who are in it just for their short term profit
Bcash doesn´t have a developer team with years of experience in maintaining a 50 billion $ financial network.
Bcash will be way more centralized as running a full Bcash node is more expensive in terms of hardware and traffic costs than running a full Bitcoin node. Therefore, less people can afford to run a full node.
Bcash has no infrastructure and no support. Bitcoin has thousands of websites, merchants, casinos which support it and a network effekt of millions of people who use Bitcoin since years.
Bitcoin is running for almost 9 years without interruption, Bcash is new and untested.
Bcash is as smart as buying more harddrives instead of using zip-, mp3- or jpeg compression in order to store more files on your computer.
Bcash is mainly supported by chinese miners and Craig Wright, a person who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto (the creator of Bitcoin) but he is a clear scam and the “evidence” he showed that he is Sathoshi is a clear fraud.
Bcash is trying to steal the brand name of bitcoin to make itself sound more trustworthy
The “creators” of Bcash couldnt even think of a unique name for their coin, that´s why they are trying to steal the name Bitcoin.
Bcash also doesn´t have its own logo, its just taking Bitcoin´s logo and rotating it a little. Pretty creative, eh?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:28:58
They can't get enough Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:16:45
Yeah that is a good point, should be able to click on 'Don't show again' 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:20:42
They are set up money wise for 50 life times already.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:25:13
Good question. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:44:15
Not nice to wake up and see we are around $6400 again!  :( 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:30:31
I would be for an increase in the block size at this moment while LN is still worked on.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:41:12
Tears of joy!

Please don't give up, this insane demand is proving too much for some sites to keep up with.

Merry Christmas  :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:42:53
I'm going to be a bit more conservative and say around $12,500
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:52:43
What if you sell now and it's at $17k tomorrow? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:01:17

**Bitcoin Indicator Turns Bullish for First Time in 8 Months**
The list of indicators signaling a long-term bullish reversal in bitcoin (BTC) continues to grow with each passing week.
The latest to join the list of a select few is the MACD histogram, which has moved above zero – turned bullish – for the first time since January.
The MACD histogram, which oscillates above and below the zero line, is one of the most popular technical indicators used to determine the trend reversal and momentum.
A bearish-to-bullish trend change is confirmed when the histogram moves above the zero line. On the other hand, a bearish reversal is confirmed when the histogram dips below zero.
The bullish turn of the MACD histogram adds credence to BTC's strong defense of the psychological support of $6,000 in the last ten weeks.
Further, it validates bearish exhaustion indicted by BTC's long-tailed monthly candle and the record low net shorts in the BTC futures market.
At press time, BTC is trading at $7,320 on Bitfinex, representing a 0.8 percent appreciation on a 24-hour basis.
A combination of the falling channel breakout and the bullish weekly MACD indicates scope for a rally to the July highs above $8,500.
For the next 24 hours, the investors need to keep an eye on the pennant pattern seen in the 4-hour chart. A bullish breakout could yield a rally to $7,500, while a downside break would shift risk in favor of a drop to $7,000.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:36:11
Yep, up on the day was good but that sharp fall from $11.8...could have done with not seeing that  :)
@_date: 2018-09-08 09:57:00
From mining? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:58:01
I was positive for a long time but I got to admit these are very worrying times for crypto.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:47:06
Good, we will see what happens in the next few weeks/months.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:11:17
Thanks for posting, scammers will do anything to get your money.
Please everyone be super careful with everything you do.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:37:47
There has been a high volume in the last few hours and like you say, a lot less volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:28:48
BCash should be $0
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:52:39
Thanks man.  It has certainly been a bumpy road today!  
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:04:44
Ok I was not too sure, thanks for clearing that up, you got the figures at hand?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:38:56
Well said  :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:17:38
How do you think your system got infected then?  What browser do you use?
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:01:52
You can't complain about any of those really.  
@_date: 2018-09-01 07:53:33
Still here in the back ground.  :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:27:50
Yeah I can't agree with your comment at all, Bitcoin should be for everyone not just for people that can invest atleast $1000.
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:10:47
Start a thread on the main Bitcoin forum and you will get more replies.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:31:10
Agreed, anyone who has not heard of Andreas has not done much research on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:35:59
There is a problem with their systems at the moment, lots of people are not able to access their wallets.
This has happened before, all we can do is wait.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:34:15
I think it's hard to judge the context of his comments and it's very easy to take people's comments the way you want to make more of a story.

@_date: 2017-12-05 14:29:23
That's only $600k
That's pocket change to the big players. 
@_date: 2019-07-29 18:09:21
I would say it's just like buying something from ebay.....
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:17:04
Recently I have started playing online poker again so it keeps me occupied and I don't watch the price that much at all compared to previously.  It's extremely sad how many hours I have spent looking at the GDAX market!  :)

Yeah if they are that big it makes sense to take notice but these 50BTC walls are just trying to con people to sell at a lower price or to buy at a higher price.

@_date: 2018-08-04 12:59:24
This is not making me happy at all!  
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:58:46
To be honest it's bloody hard to be positive through this year, all we can do is see what happens, no one really knows! 
@_date: 2018-08-09 08:28:05
Wow! I've never heard anyone say that before!  :) 
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:29:26

Yep, not sure why he bothers posting on here.

**GoTenna Launches a Bitcoin Wallet That Works Without the Internet**
If James Bond needed to use bitcoin on a secret mission in the jungle, he probably couldn't drop by a Starbucks to use the wifi.
Since internet connections aren't always available, reliable or private, cryptocurrency users need alternative ways to connect to the network. So the New York-based startup goTenna, founded in 2012 by Brazilian siblings Daniela and Jorge Perdomo, is partnering with Samourai Wallet to launch an Android app this summer that allows users to send bitcoin payments without an internet connection.
Announced Monday, the txTenna app will enable users to sync up their mobile with a goTenna device, which costs $179 per pair, then toggle the wallet app's settings to transact offline and send the bitcoin.
"You need to be able to spend your bitcoin even in disaster areas," goTenna engineer Richard Meyers told CoinDesk, citing the Perdomo siblings' recent work in Puerto Rico, where goTenna devices helped people reconnect after Hurricane Maria. "As long as you have a way to charge your phone, you can be up and meshed and communicating."
The signal needs to be within roughly a mile of another goTenna device to relay the message across the mesh network, a decades-old system for using the internet without wifi or a landline. So far, goTenna has sold more than 100,000 devices that let users tap into the mesh network.
If the offline bitcoin user is within a mile of another active device, the transaction could bounce across the mesh until it reaches a user with an internet connection.
"It offers an alternative that is more censorship-resistant," Meyers said, adding:
"It's going to obscure who you are and where you're at when making these transactions. So that's a big privacy advantage there."
This system uses a free, unlicensed radio frequency, and it isn't the first partnership to explore such potential for cryptocurrency networks.
It takes a village
Stepping back, a variety of projects since the Cold War have used relatively cheap and mobile radio setups to broadcast across firewalls and oceans.
Last year, renowned cryptographer Nick Szabo and blockchain engineer Elaine Ou published a proposal detailing how weak-signal radio transmissions could help boost security and the diversity of connections across the bitcoin network.
Then, in December, after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed "net neutrality," fans of ethereum, the world's second most popular blockchain network, started flocking to mesh network technology meetups.
When net neutrality rules expire next month, internet service providers will no longer be barred from favoring or blocking specific websites and communities. It's an opportune moment for censorship-resistant tools for bitcoin transactions.
Perhaps the most important aspect of txTenna is that the cryptocurrency wallet will be an open source project.
Indeed, it was Samourai Wallet's open source communication tools on Github that first inspired goTenna's team to reach out to the bitcoin startup. The same txTenna code could theoretically be applied to iOS wallet applications as well.
As Meyers explained:
"It absolutely could work with any software wallet and they [Samourai Wallet developers] are not writing it specifically for the Samourai wallet anyway. It will be something any wallet provider could send transactions through."

**For Wall Street, Bitcoin ETF Decision Could Answer '$1 Billion' Question**
"I wish I knew the answer to your $1 billion question. Seriously."
That's Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategy at New York-based investment management firm VanEck, the company has been making headlines of late for a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). No lightweight in the arena, though, the VanEck proposal has been deemed by some to have the best shot of being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Indeed, all eyes are on the SEC in the wake of its comment period, with a possible yes or no – or further delay – expected by Friday. Even so, Gurbacs is cautious about what to expect from the SEC in coming months.
When asked what he suspected the outcome would be, he deferred.
He told CoinDesk:
"Unfortunately, I don't know the answer. I do know that we have addressed market structure issues and this is a chance for regulators to bring bitcoin under existing frameworks and protect investors."
Still, if the measure fails, it won't be for a lack of effort.
For one, VanEck's specific proposal came about nearly three years ago when SolidX, a financial technology company also headquartered in New York, first began to work toward bringing a bitcoin ETF to market.
Since a partnership between VanEck and SolidX, announced in early June, commentary on the matter has since significantly increased in favor of approval. And it's not just crypto investors who are pushing the concept, but economists, CEOs, financial analysts and even one SEC commissioner herself (though the latter was made in support of a different bitcoin ETF proposal).
The difference
So, what makes the VanEck-SolidX bitcoin ETF unique? Simply put, it's different from past efforts such as the recently rejected Winklevoss ETF.
As Gurbacs explained, "it is an insured product." As such, the physical bitcoins backing ETF shares would be covered in case of "theft and hacks and losses of all sorts."
This, however, isn't the selling point for Phil Bak, a former managing director at the New York Stock Exchange and current CEO of Exponential ETFs.
The way Bak sees in, the insurance aspect of the VanEck/SolidX proposal may be useful but "could also open up a can of worms and more questions," explaining that "[the SEC is] always going to have some hesitation about claiming that anything is guaranteed or insured in any scenario."
No, the very "elegant" solution in Bak's mind that is unique and quite ingenious on the part of VanEck and SolidX is how it is designed to weed out non-accredited investors.
Bak explains:
"When you launch a new fund, you can arbitrarily set the initial N.A.V. and the initial trade price where you want and they come in around $20, $25…What they've done, they've announced that they're going to set the price to $200,000, which means you can't buy a fractional share. It means the minimum notional amount that an investor can put into the bitcoin fund is going to be $200,000, which means that by definition anybody who's trading the fund is an accredited investor."
And Gurbacs would completely agree.
In an interview with CoinDesk last week, Gurbacs affirmed that the ETF was "institutionally oriented."
"Today, the bitcoin markets are still 90-95 percent retail and institutions are looking for a way to get into these markets so the physical ETF we have tailored to institutions," he remarked.
Others see the ETF as a possible path to future products around crypto, including Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
Balchunas thinks of the institutionally-geared VanEck-SolidX ETF as the "bridge between not approving and approving an actual regular primetime-ready ETF with a share price that looks more normal," adding that this is one of the primary reasons why the SEC might consider the prospect of approving it as a "baby step towards a real ETF."
Long road ahead
Those differences aside, whether the SEC actually approves the proposed ETF remains to be seen.
For his part, Balchunas predicted a 5 to 10 percent likelihood of seeing the VanEck/SolidX proposal greenlit by the SEC this year.
To be clear, the proposal is currently at a stage frequented by all new ETFs – crypto or otherwise – wherein the partnering exchange (in this case, Cboe BZX Exchange) has filed for a "rule change" with the SEC in order to be included on the exchange listing venue.
According to Bak, even with approval by the SEC on this front, the partnering companies "would still need to get approval from the Division of Corporate Finance from the SEC," adding:
"There's a whole 'nother set of approvals that would still need to come."
Given that, in his view, a "blanket approval" is highly unlikely at the outset, Bak emphasizes that the SEC certainly has "the option to extend these things out over longer time frames," which has been the case for five other bitcoin ETF proposals in recent days.
Indeed, in light of all the commentary that has been sparked by the VanEck-SolidX bitcoin ETF, the proposal remains in early "registration" stages, which though Gurbacs insists has addressed all relevant concerns to do with "customer protection and compliance, price and validation, liquidity and a few other major outstanding issues" does not indicate a regulated bitcoin ETF is coming soon in the U.S.
"I think that what most people don't understand is that there's a formal process where you go back and forth with the regulators... They might say, 'Hey, let's work on this particular topic like pricing,' and they'll call us and we'll look at our indices," Gurbacs told CoinDesk, adding:
"We think we have done the work and the work is good enough to go but again… no one is going to know the date but the SEC."
Sounds kind of promising and obviously aimed at the big boys.  $200k minimum.

**Bitcoin Bears Still in Charge But Indecision Could Open Doors for Rally**
While the odds are still stacked in favor of bitcoin's bears, a level of indecision looks to be creeping in, according to the technical charts.
The cryptocurrency fell to a 6.5-week low of $7,142 on Bitfinex earlier today, having breached the 50-week moving average (MA) support for the first time since 2015.
Amid the continued drop in prices, though, the charts show a doji candle formed yesterday, indicating that the bears may be running out of steam and a short-term rally could be on the cards.
As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,210 – down 16.58 percent from the last Monday's high of $8,644.
BTC looks set to test the psychological support of $7,000. Acceptance below that level would expose the April 1 low of $6,425.
An unexpected close today (as per UTC) above $7,425 (doji candle high) would confirm a short-term bullish doji reversal and allow a minor corrective rally, possibly to $7,800–$8,000.
Only a convincing move above the weekly 50-MA would abort the bearish view. Meanwhile, a break above $9,990 (May 5 high) would imply a bullish reversal.

**Bitcoin Bulls Seek Breakout to $10K or Higher**
Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a narrowing price range over the past week, but a bullish breakout is looking likely, the technical charts suggest.
The cryptocurrency created a bearish outside-day candle last Wednesday, signaling the rally from the low of $6,425 had run out of steam. However, the bitcoin bulls ensured there was no negative follow-through on Thursday and defended $8,800 over the weekend.
While a convincing break above $9,500 has remained elusive so far, the charts suggest the bulls have the stronger hand going forward.
Bitcoin will likely witness a bull-pennant breakout and rise towards $9,975 (200-day MA) and $10,000 (psychological hurdle).
A daily close (as per UTC) above $10,000 could bring a stronger rally to $11,306 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $19,891 to $6,000).
A downside break of the pennant pattern would weaken the bulls and expose support lined up at $8,490 and $8,104 (50-day MA).
Only a daily close below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal bear revival.
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:51:13
Don't give up hope, they will be back very soon.
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:08:11

**Bitcoin Sets Sights Above $10K After Bull Breakout**
Following a bull breakout last night, bitcoin (BTC) looks set to test $10,000 and could possibly move higher over the weekend.
Bitcoin closed yesterday (as per UTC) at $9,759 on Bitfinex - the highest daily close since March 7 - signaling the upside break of the week-long narrowing price range we've been anticipating.
The cryptocurrency also clocked a two-month high of $9,875 yesterday. At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,776 and remains on the hunt for a big break above the $10,000 mark, as indicated by the bullish setup in the technical charts below.
BTC looks set to test the 200-day MA resistance of $10,015. A close (as per UTC) above that level would strengthen the bull grip and could yield a sustained rally to $10,455 and above.
The outlook remains bullish as long as prices hold above the ascending 10-day MA, located at $9,290.
An unexpected close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (April 26 low, pennant low) would signal a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.

**Buffett 'Disciple' Condemns Investor's Views On Bitcoin**
Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya has countered billionaire Warren Buffett's recent derogatory statements on bitcoin, stating that the cryptocurrency is "important."
His comments come after Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, argued that bitcoin is more of a gamble than an investment at the end of April, and then, last weekend at a shareholders' meeting, he said bitcoin is "probably rat poison squared."
While calling himself a Buffett "disciple," Palihapitiya told CNBC that Buffett is wrong about bitcoin.
"Not everybody is right all the time," he told the news source, further suggesting that that knowledge about technology is not in Buffett's "circle of competence."
Palihapitiya, a former Facebook and AOL executive, went on to push for the cryptocurrency's benefits, saying it is a replacement to gold and:
"Something like bitcoin is really important, because it is not correlated to the rest of the market."
Speaking about the financial crisis, he said that "things that we thought were hedges went away" and "broke down." Bitcoin is viewed as providing a hedge to traditional finance by those who have owned the digital currency, he said.

Bitcoin's price rose 33 percent against the U.S. dollar in April, making it the best month of 2018 for the world's largest cryptocurrency.
Data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) shows that May began with bitcoin's price at the $9,244.32 mark - a 33 percent jump from its April 1 start of $6,926.02. This marks the greatest rise in bitcoin's price this year, and one of only two months where it rose at all within the period.

**Sell In May and Go Away? Not for Bitcoin Bulls**
Sell in May and go away? While the month may traditionally give equity bulls cold feet, it should probably not be a cause of worry for the bitcoin market.
Indeed, it's true the month of May is often a weak period for equities, and that bitcoin has acted as a risk asset (moving in tandem with equities) since February. As such, cryptocurrency investors may fear that a potential drop in equities could end up dragging bitcoin prices lower.
However, historical data suggests that bitcoin is more likely to build upon its April rally this month.
Notably, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has scored gains in the month of May in five out of the last seven years, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.
BTC tends to perform well in May, thus an upside breakout of the narrowing price range is more likely and could yield a quick move higher to $10,000.
On the other hand, a downside break would open the doors to $8,490 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,767.4).
Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal a bear revival.

**Bitcoin Price Eyes Breakout As Trading Range Tightens**
Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a narrow $550 range between the key long-term moving averages today, but may be prepping for a breakout, the technical charts suggest.
With the bull/bear bias now unclear, the big problem now is trying to work out in which direction the price will go.
As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,760 on Bitfinex, and is trading between the 50-day moving average (MA) at $8,287 and the 100-day moving average at $8,837.
The sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 came to halt around the 50-day MA on Saturday. Further, the 50-day MA also acted as strong support on Monday. Meanwhile, on both occasions, the rebound from the 50-day MA ran out of steam around the 100-day MA hurdle.
The rangebound action seen in the last three days has established the 50-day MA as a major support and the 100-day MA as a formidable resistance and the breakout of this zone will likely set the tone for the next big move in BTC.
Another rejection at the descending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart will likely yield a drop to 50-day MA located at $8,287.
That said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and would allow a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).
On the other hand, a convincing move above $8,910 (expanding channel hurdle) would expose resistance lined up at $9,390.

@_date: 2019-11-22 10:06:07
I guess a lot depends on what time scales you use, if you go from the start it has been an incredible store of value.  If you go from the peaks, not so good obviously.  
You could argue that the mining hardware and electricity created a profit for the miners as the vast majority of miners sell as they produce so they are making profit regularly.
In your example it would not be a great store of value at all.

I think you can work out the answer to your question :)  
I do anticipate the price to increase over the long term.
I'm fully aware that market moves are not 50-50, all I was trying to say is that it's impossible to predict markets with a really high certainty because there are so many factors to consider and also many factors that are totally unpredictable.  Like virtually no one knew that the leader of China was going to come out with those comments the other week.  Another example being not many people knew about the Chinese Ponzi scheme (Plus Token) even existing or them getting busted until is was released to the MSM.  My casino reference was that just because you have seen a pattern repeat x amount of times does not mean that pattern will continue.  Yes TA works to some extent but it's far from an exact science and even the best traders get things wrong a lot.

**An Army of Bitcoin Devs Is Battle-Testing Upgrades to Privacy and Scaling**
[ 
 
**You can think of it as a massive study group with big potential repercussions for bitcoin's usability.**
Almost 200 developers are currently reviewing "Bitcoin Improvement Proposals" (BIPs) around Taproot and [Schnorr]( upgrades to the premier cryptocurrency that could usher in enhanced privacy and scalability. 
Pioneered by Xapo bitcoin core contributor Anthony Towns, the idea is to get as many developers as possible to review the changes, to battle-test the BIPs and make sure the ideas are actually safe.
"This is a way to make sure more people understand the proposal as early as possible," Towns said.
Organizers and have been calling the review group an "experiment," as this style of a review group has never been organized so far, and they're not quite sure how it will go. Towns pointed to Chaincode developer John Newbery's weekly[ bitcoin review group]( as a model for roping developers into the review process.
BIPs are always public for anyone to review and there are plenty of avenues for offering feedback, like, worst case, if there's a security vulnerability with the code. But not everyone knows how this process works.
The[ project description]( admits that "not many people are familiar with reviewing BIPs in the first place, and there are a lot of concepts involved in the three BIPs for people to get their heads around."
But Square Crypto project manager Steve Lee is encouraged this is a way to get more developers involved. “People from all over the world have registered, and many names I have not heard of before," he said. Square is a sizable [investor and innovator]( in bitcoin tech.
 How to change bitcoin
In the midst of a sprawling code change, consensus is hard to achieve. Towns says there is a three-step process: identifying the need for a change, writing the code that implements the change, and “having everyone using bitcoin adopt the new code so that the change actually happens," Towns said. 
This study group is part of stage one, he said, with participants scrutinizing a handful of "BIPs," or technical proposals for improving bitcoin.
"It’s where we get the details nailed down so that we can work out if things actually make sense or it’s all pie-in-the-sky dream," Towns told CoinDesk.
Though it's a long process, several BIPs have made their way into the bitcoin code over the last decade. Perhaps the best-known is Segregated Witness (SegWit), a change that paved the way for lightning network, early-stage technology that might be bitcoin's best chance at reaching a higher volume of users.
Developers have been discussing adding Schnorr to bitcoin for years. With no major problems found so far, it and Taproot look like a shoe-in.
That said, this effort will bring more eyes to the BIPs. And experts will be closely guiding developers who have never been through the BIP process before.
Participants are spending four-plus hours a week over the next two months sifting proposals and talking them over in small groups.
The BIP group is holding a series of Q&amp;As with experts long-time immersed in bitcoin's underlying technology.
 Spontaneous suggestion
As Towns described it, the group formed almost by accident, just as a decentralized bitcoin development process often does.
Developers chat about changes to bitcoin over Internet Relay Chat (IRC). The chat group is completely open – any bitcoiner is invited to join these chat groups, whether to read the transcripts to learn about bitcoin, or to contribute new ideas.
One such discussion centered on how to get the change Taproot to the next level.
"A few of us were chatting on IRC about the Taproot proposal and how to move on from the current draft BIPs to the next steps, and how we would even know when people were comfortable enough with the BIPs that it was time to do that," Towns said. "A couple of hours later we had a shared doc with a rough draft of what that might look like, and it ballooned from there."
The spontaneity of the two-month program highlights how flexible the bitcoin development process can be. Anyone who understands the current processes well enough can try to take initiative.

The digital currency was seized as part of a criminal investigation called PRATKA/VIRUS that the South East European Law Enforcement Centre (SELEC) carried out in partnership with Bulgaria. The international cybercrime bust, arrests of 23 suspects and seizures of property including bitcoin were reported by the SELEC in May 2017.

Who is making all the money from Venezuela's Oil? 
 Venezuela is one of the world's largest exporters of oil and has the world's largest proven oil reserves at an estimated **296.5 billion barrels** (20% of global reserves) as of 2012.
@_date: 2019-11-12 22:35:11
Wow, the oil being controlled by those countries you mentioned does not surprise me at all, although I am surprised the USA has not got some control of it.
Corruption is almost guaranteed in any South American country but they seem to be taking it to new levels in  Venezuela.
Thanks for the post.

I think that's pretty decent and I'm very happy with that.  Most serious investors did not want another version of the late 2017 rise.
Hopefully we get nice steady progress for the rest of 2019, I personally will be very, very happy if we get to $15k at some point this year.

**Bakkt has been cleared to launch.**
The Intercontinental Exchange’s young subsidiary [announced Friday]( that it had acquired a [New York state trust charter]( through the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The approval clears the way for the company to begin offering its highly-anticipated physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts. **The company intends to launch its products on Sept. 23.**
Bakkt, first unveiled last August, has been working on regulatory approvals to begin offering the product over the past year. It intends to offer two types of contracts: a daily and a monthly contract. Both will be settled at the Bakkt Warehouse, a part of its New York-chartered trust company.
In a blog post Friday, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loefler wrote, “Our contracts have already received the green light from the CFTC through the self-certification process and user acceptance testing has begun.”
“With approval by the New York State Department of Financial Services to create Bakkt Trust Company, a qualified custodian, the Bakkt Warehouse will custody bitcoin for physically delivered futures,” she said. “This offers customers unprecedented regulatory clarity and security alongside a regulated, globally accessible exchange in a market underserved by institutional-grade infrastructure.”
She went on to add:

***Bitcoin Price on the Rise After First Fed Rate Cut Since 2008***
[ 
 
 View
* Bitcoin could rise to $10,500 in the next 24 hours or so, as the 4-hour chart is looking more bullish.
* A break above $11,120 is [needed]( to revive the short-term bullish outlook, though.
* Some expert believe the just-announced U.S. Fed interest rate cut could bode well for BTC in the long-run.
Bitcoin (BTC) has eked out moderate gains amid the U.S. Federal Reserve’s announcement of its first rate cut in over a decade.
The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $9,950 on Bitstamp, representing a 2 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.
The Federal Reserve (Fed) on Wednesday said it will [lower interest rates]( by 0.25 percent to cushion the economy from a global slowdown and trade tensions. That was the first U.S. interest rate cut since the great financial crisis of 2008, and indeed since the creation of bitcoin in 2009.
BTC rose by over $200 to $10,000 in the three hours leading up to the Fed’s announcement at 18:00 UTC. More importantly, the cryptocurrency remained bid in the following hours and hit a high of $10,172, according to Bitstamp data.
The price action seems to have convinced [investors]( that BTC picked up a bid due to Fed’s rate cut.
 Boon for bitcoin?
Some observers believe rate cuts by the Fed bode well for BTC.
This is because an interest rate cut reduces the yield on a currency. Further, the liquidity added to the economy via rate cuts often leads to inflation and loss of purchasing power of the currency.
Put simply, falling interest rates mean fewer reasons to hold U.S. dollars, as [pointed out]( by Alan Silbert, executive managing director at INX Trading Platform.
Silbert believes the Fed will deliver more rate cuts in the near future. The central bank, however, refrained from signaled further easing yesterday.
The Fed has cut rates less than 12 months away from bitcoin’s mining reward halving – a process aimed at curbing inflation by reducing reward for mining on the blockchain by 50 percent every four years.
Essentially, BTC’s monetary policy is on a preset path – its supply is halved every four years.
The monetary policy divergence would widen further if the Fed embarks on a full-blown easing cycle, as anticipated by Silbert. That would further strengthen bitcoin’s appeal as store of value and may bolster the bull market.
As for the next 24 hours, bitcoin looks set to test key average located at $10,500.
 
BTC rose above $10,000 yesterday, validating the seller exhaustion signaled by the long-tailed doji created on the 4-hour chart on July 28.
That bullish doji reversal indicates that the sell-off from recent highs above $13,000 has ended and the path of least resistance is to the higher side. The descending triangle breakout confirmed yesterday also indicates a bull reversal.
Notably, buying volumes picked up following the price breakout. The green volume bar created in the four hours to 16:00 UTC yesterday was the highest since July 19.
Hence, the cryptocurrency may rise toward $10,500 (50-day moving average) over the next day or two. However, the outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish only if and when BTC [invalidates]( the bearish lower-highs pattern with a move above $11,120.
The case for a rise to the 50-day MA in the next 24 hours would weaken if prices find acceptance below yesterday’s low of $9,574, although that looks unlikely.

* A UTC close above $12,030 would confirm the falling channel breakout and allow a rally to $13,880 (June 26 high).

**Rakuten’s Crypto Exchange Has Launched for Trading in 3 Cryptos**
[ 
Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten has launched its own exchange for crypto spot trading.
[Announced]( Monday, Rakuten Wallet has gone live for trading in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and bitcoin cash (BCH) against the Japanese yen via an Android mobile app. An iOS app is due to be released in the future, though no set timeline was provided.
The firm said customer funds held by the subsidiary will be managed separately from its own, under the eye of its trust company, Rakuten Trust, and through savings accounts at Rakuten Bank.
Rakuten further stresses that users’ deposited cryptos will be held in cold, or offline, storage to minimize the risk of hacking. For added security, private keys are managed using a multisignature scheme, and two-step authentication is required when signing in and making withdrawals.
No fees are charged for making trades or deposits, which are conducted in real time, 365 days a year (excluding when maintenance is occurring), the firm says.
However, for withdrawals, Rakuten Wallet will charge 300 JYN (around $2.80), and for crypto withdrawals it will charge at the (slightly arbitrary seeming) rates of: bitcoin at 0.001 BTC ($10.70), ether at 0.01 ETH ($2) and bitcoin cash at 0.01 BCH ($3.20), with conversions correct at time of writing.
The lack of fees on buying and selling cryptos should appeal to users making frequent trades.
Rakuten first revealed its exchange play in March, saying it had been awarded a license in Japan for its rebranded entity – an exchange platform called Everybody’s Bitcoin acquired for [$2.4 million]( last August. In May, it [partnered]( with blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace to help ensure regulatory compliance for the exchange.

[ 
 View
* Bitcoin is looking north, with the daily chart reporting a bearish channel breakout following a six-week-long correction. A retest of highs above $13,000 could be in the offing.
* The bullish case would strengthen if prices rise above $12,145, invalidating consolidation or exhaustion signaled by Wednesday’s candlestick pattern. A [stronger confirmation]( of a bull revival would be a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000.
* A break below Wednesday’s low of $11,388 would weaken the bullish case. That level could come into play in the next 24 hours if the symmetrical triangle seen on the hourly chart is breached to the downside.

The new bitcoin futures contracts have been shaped by our conversations with stakeholders, and offer unique trading, security and risk management features.
Two futures contracts will be listed: 1) A daily settlement bitcoin future, which will enable customers to transact in a same-day market. And 2) a monthly bitcoin futures contract will enable trading in the front month and across the forward pricing curve.
The futures contracts will be margined by ICE Clear US, including the collection of initial margin collateral and variation margin to manage risk. This approach is consistent with capital-efficient risk management practices in global futures markets, ranging from oil and gold to interest rates and equity index futures.

**Bullish Signals Hint at Bitcoin Price Breakout**
Still stuck in a narrowing price range, BTC could soon rise to resistance above $8,000 if the bulls are able to leap the 50-week moving average hurdle.
As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,770 on Bitfinex, having been stuck in a narrowing price range (pennant) for months now.
Defense of $7,000 last week and the 9.3 percent rise from the last week's low have neutralized the immediate bearish outlook and got investors talking about a possible rally to pennant resistance at $8,870.
While that target may appear far-fetched, it may be put to test if bitcoin can first scale the key 50-week moving average (MA) resistance (currently located at $7,819) in a convincing manner.
BTC could rally to $8,000 in the next 24 hours or so if the resistance at $7,780 is breached.
BTC looks set to close this week (Sunday's close as per UTC) above the 50-week MA of $7,819. In this case, the probability of a move higher towards pennant resistance of $8,880 would rise sharply.
Bearish scenario: BTC could drop to pennant support at $7,080 if the bulls fail to capitalize on the positive setup seen in the daily chart and prices drop below $7,372 (June 5 low).
A weekly close below$7,080 (downside break of the pennant pattern) could yield a sell-off below $6,000 (February low).

We have to accept that when we have abandoned shipping containers strewn around the world with millions of unsold over produced useless things like beanie babies, whilst warehouses full of perfectly edible food and medical supplies rot away... and the people who desperately need that aid and grew and cultivated the very food rotting away - sit next to those warehouses with distended stomachs, subjugated and starving - because somebody gambled on the future price of those goods and it was deemed 'unprofitable' to put them to use... all whilst greed has reached such levels in the West obesity is now one of the biggest killers - then it is clear something is very, very wrong with the world and those people we are allowing to govern over a system that continues to allow those crimes against humanity to happen, need to hand things over to a new generation of scientists and nurturers capable of reversing the damage they have caused.
People in that racket will of course feel sleighted by this, they will say "but I'm just doing my job" as they press those Bloomberg terminal buttons... in the exact same way those SS soldiers (who would also fail the Milgram experiment) would be just "doing their job" as they pressed the gas release buttons in those shower blocks.
By the time the obvious truth is realised by the many that the entire economy is built on a cult of casino gamblers following the 'orders' of addicts peddling bad mathematics and pseudo science, whilst suffering mass psychosis and delusions of grandeur... An entirely new collaborative digital economy will have been built in plain sight on the internet by people who understand the future of the species cannot be safeguarded by those people playing zero sum games, whose actions are contributing to human misery and inequity of wealth, the likes of which we've never seen before.
Now, more than ever, we need remarkable people to take responsibility and use this technology we're all so in love with to fix the rot at the heart of all this. That requires complete systemic change and a new way of looking at things.
It's worth remembering that was the very reason bitcoin was created. It is not a speculative vehicle to continue the same business as usual. Those treating it as such, will need to take a long hard look in the mirror when all this begins to make sense and ask which side of history they want to tell future generations they stood on.
"In his 2013 answer to the annual Edge magazine question, Eric Weinstein made a distinction between two very different kinds of people: the “excellent” and the “remarkable”. The former, he says, have optimized for playing and winning the current dominant game. They have gone to the best schools. They have worked at the best institutions. They have excelled. Echoing evolutionary theory, he calls them “hill climbers” – and if you need to climb a hill, they are the right people to call.
But if the challenge is not to climb some well understood hill, but to cross the “adaptive valley” of the unknown, the excellent are woefully unprepared. If you need to wander through uncertainty in search of an as yet poorly understood but potentially vastly superior game, you need to call on an entirely different kind of person: the remarkable.”

Top Fed Official Says US Central Bank ‘Actively’ Debating Digital Dollar
[ 
A top Federal Reserve official said Wednesday that the U.S. central bank is “actively looking at and debating” issuance of a digital currency, amid growing worries among current and former regulators that the dollar might be at risk of losing its status as the world’s reserve currency.
Speaking at a local business event in Austin, Texas, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Rob Kaplan said:


A former Goldman Sachs executive with the most extensive capital-markets experience among members and alternates on the Fed’s key monetary-policy committee, Kaplan said the U.S. could suffer higher interest costs if a foreign government or another entity developed an alternative currency that received widespread adoption.
His comments came after former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair J. Christopher Giancarlo wrote in an [op-ed piece]( that called for the U.S. to create a digital currency to avoid the risk that the dollar might lose its reserve status. Giancarlo now serves as an advisor to the [Chamber of Digital Commerce]( a trade group focused on blockchain and crypto policy.
Because of the dollar’s prominent role in international commerce and the dominant U.S. leadership position in global affairs over the past century, many foreign central banks, commercial banks and investors hold assets denominated in the American currency.
If that stopped happening due to the existence of an attractive and viable alternative, the thinking goes, then demand for U.S. assets such as Treasury bonds would shrink, in turn pushing up interest rates on the national debt, which is now approaching an unprecedented [$23 trillion](
Kaplan noted that the U.S. government’s interest rates could jump by some $200 billion if a loss of the reserve-currency status sent interest rates jumping by a single percentage point, or 100 basis points in the lingo of bond traders.
In response to a question from CoinDesk, Kaplan said:


“It’s $200 billion a year and all of a sudden we’ve got a tremendous problem here, so it’s something we’re watching very closely.”
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and some U.S. lawmakers warned earlier this year that Facebook’s plan to develop a digital currency, Libra, could instantly become so popular that it might displace the dollar and undermine the stability of the U.S. financial system.
Yet those concerns have faded recently as some top corporate backers of the project, including the payment networks Mastercard and Visa, have withdrawn their support.
“I noticed Libra seems to be receding at the moment,” Kaplan said. But “somebody’s going to figure out how to do this.”
Kaplan said he talks to many foreign officials in his Fed role:


The U.S. trade war with China has weighed on the global economy, according to the International Monetary Fund, while agreements with other large trading partners, including Mexico, Canada and European countries have been upended or back on the table to be renegotiated.
The U.S. Treasury Department has also imposed stiff sanctions on regimes perceived as unfriendly or corrupt, including Iran and Venezuela.
Kaplan said:


Is this good for Bitcoin in the long run?

**BREAKING: South Korea Just Released The Bitcoin Bulls! Bitcoin Adoption Jumps Ahead 3+ Years!**
[ 
**South Korea Declares Partial ‘Regulation-Free’ Zone for Crypto Companies**
[ 
 
Busan has been declared a “regulation-free” zone for blockchain development by South Korea’s national government, a move long expected but now formalized as part of a larger liberalization push.
[Zug]( Switzerland is said to be one of the models for the zone.
The Ministry of SMEs and Startups announced on July 24 that the second largest city in the country by population will host a wide range of blockchain offerings related to finance, public safety and tourism, though it stopped short of fully opening the market and allowing for international-level crypto initiatives, according to the Korea Herald.
A total of [eleven regulations]( have been lifted for the project. It is expected that investors will move 29.9 billion won ($25 million) into the region by 2021 and development will be spread between the Munhyeon Innovation District, the Centum Innovation District and the Dongsam Innovation District.
BNK Busan Bank, a Korea Exchange-listed local institution, will supervise blockchain management as it relates to finance and might be developing a stablecoin pegged to the won.
Hyundai Pay is supporting payment solutions and advances in tourism. The company, which was established in 2016 by the CEO of Hyundai BS&amp;C (also grandson of the founder of the Hyundai Group), signed a [memorandum of understanding]( with the city in February in which it said it would move its headquarters to Busan and help it develop blockchain infrastructure utilizing the Hdac blockchain platform.
Other elements of the program include a public safety offering by Gyeonggi Province-based Coinplug, which claims to be Korea’s largest holder of blockchain patents. The development will include an app which allows citizens to video natural disasters and crimes and send the files to the appropriate authorities, complete with location information. A rewards system will encourage the use of the app. The next stage will involve a database that will allow for the storing and sharing of information.
BP&amp;Solution, a Busan-based computer company, will work on blockchain as it relates to fisheries.
The region won’t be completely “regulation-free,” however. ICOs will not be allowed, and the project is still decidedly conservative in terms of cryptocurrency. The stablecoin envisioned will be highly limited in terms of its use. It will mainly be a component of a rewards system incentivizing participation in the other local blockchain offerings and will only be redeemable at certain establishments, making it more a voucher than a coin. Busan has explicitly said that the reforms are not designed to be cryptocurrency-related.
While the government move has been billed as an exemption from regulation, it is more a controlled experiment with certain defined goals and is evolutionary rather than revolutionary and fitting with Korea’s general and persistent suspicion of crypto.
The plan was initially mentioned in April, when Busan was reported to have won out over Jeju, a province already known for its relatively liberal policies. Jeju developed an ambitious and rather aggressive vision in 2018 to become a crypto island.
Busan has long been a center for trading and finance as well as a hub for innovation, and it is the home of the Korea Exchange. The city has been working for some time on blockchain-related developments, including the use of the technology at the port.
The recent designation of Busan as Korea’s blockchain capital is connected to a broad policy drive by Korea’s current administration. President Moon Jae-in has been promoting so-called regulatory sandboxes, which allow for the temporary suspension of rules so that new technologies and services can be tested outside the complex legal and bureaucratic environment in the country.
A goal of 100 such sandboxes was set for 2019, and as of mid July, 81 had been approved.
In line with the sandbox push, the government has named seven areas (cities and provinces) that will receive blanket sandbox privileges in certain  technologies. South Jeolla Province, for example, will focus on e-mobility, Daegu on smart wellness and Sejong on autonomous driving.

# Bakkt Opinion Piece
 [ 
 
Bakkt opinion piece. In 3-6 months you will see in hindsight. you will say holy shit that was bullish. Short term who knows what happens to price, id argue the best strategy right now would be an aggressive DCA just in case it does have one more big leg down. Because Bakkt is physically Backed, and they are a multi-billion dollar dealing enterprise, i imagine their trading is going to have a strong effect on the market as it directly affects the supply (unlike CME). Ironically with CME, it wasn't popular to use until we bottomed and then all of a sudden some whale buys 80k contracts! Im sure its just a strange coincidence and convenience that all of a sudden futures were made available at 2017 peak, get barely used, and then a huge order comes in at the very bottom.
With Bakkt, thing is Bitcoin is less than a 300 billion MC. That's really small compared to the massive amount of money / connections the NYSE has. As well, soon you will have ErisX which is the Nasdaq version. Bottom line is these legacy wall street titan companies want to have a better control of the Supply, and thus will weed out any bullshit exchanges that can manipulate. NYSE wants to manipulate LOL, but i bet there is also some truth to it and they sincerely see the need/demand/business opportunity to create a trusted platform for a burgeoning new asset class. This is what ICE did for the energy markets, and if history is any guide, Bitcoin will become huge. I don't see how there can be any other way. There will now be a compliant trusted way for the biggest money to participate in the bitcoin economy and first things first is they have to establish positions. Once the MC of bitcoin is much higher , the booms and bust will be less, Bitcoin will in fact become "Tame." But the ppl with the foresight , long term vision and balls accumulating now and/or have been holding for years will get the biggest reward. I don't see any other way for this to unfold. Ive always said Bitcoin is a prophecy , and ppl of course balk at me, but this news and future news will be ironic coincidences' that power Bitcoin to the Moon (Ethereum will also make it to moon).

**Bitcoin’s Computing Power Sets Record as Over 100K New Miners Go Online**
[ 
The total computing power now dedicated to securing the bitcoin blockchain has set yet another record.
According to data from mining services operator [BTC.com]( the average bitcoin mining hash rate over the last two weeks has reached 71.43 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s), up from 64.49EH/s on July 23. The threshold was breached as bitcoin adjusted its mining difficulty at block height 586,672 on Monday 2:52 UTC – that is a 6.94EH/s, or 10.78 percent jump since mid July. 
Bitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards on bitcoin. Just how difficult the bitcoin software makes it to generate new blocks adjusts every 2,016 blocks – approximately every 14 days – to ensure the block production time remains about 10 minutes at the next cycle.
Assume this additional 6.9EH/s (or 6.9 million tera hashes per second, TH/s) computing power has all come from powerful ASIC miners, such as Bitmain’s AntMiner S17 or MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20S, both of which boast a mining rate of around 55TH/s and recently hit the market.
That means more than 100,000 top-of-line ASIC miners could have been switched on within the past two weeks. Further, given these products have been sold for at least $2,000 each, this equates to some $200 million in revenue pocketed for major miner makers.
The continued interest in bitcoin mining comes at a time when the cryptocurrency’s price appears to be en route to challenging all-time highs, however distantly, and amid the arrival of the rainy season in China, which leads to cheaper hydropower electricity costs in the country’s southwest provinces – a region that is [reported]( to account for 50 percent of the global mining activity,
Miners in China [estimated]( earlier this year that bitcoin’s hash rate in the summer would break the level of 70EH/s. To be clear, at several single points of time, bitcoin’s hash rate had already crossed that level in June and even reached 80EH/s around Aug. 1. 
However, today marks the first time that the two-week average computing power has been able to remain above the 70EH/s threshold. As such, bitcoin’s mining difficulty has also set a new record of nearly 10 trillion.
 Market change
Amidst this uptick in mining interest, there have been notable changes in the mining market, where top manufacturers are racing to produce more powerful equipment.
For instance, in Bitmain’s 2018 initial public offering prospectus, the Beijing-based mining giant claimed it had a 70 percent market dominance. Now, it may be facing serious competition from rival players that some believe are capable of shipping more top-of-line products with better profitability. 
Michael Zhong, a former mining analyst who now operates mining farms at a startup called [The Force Mining]( told CoinDesk that based on his experience, the production capacity ranking among major Chinese miner makers for their flagship products have changed over the years. 
Zhong explained that from 2017 to 2018, Bitmain had topped the list with its AntMiner S9 series miners, followed by Canaan’s Avalon 8 series machines. InnoSilicon, Ebang and former Bitmain design director’s MicroBT were all in the third position at the time.
But from January to June this year, the delivery capacity ranking has reshuffled, with now MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20 series at the top, followed by Bitmain’s S17 series miners and then InnoSilicon, Canaan, and Ebang, Zhong added.
According to F2pool’s [miner profit tracker]( Bitmain’s flagship AntMiner S17 Pro ranks third in terms of mining profitability, following BitFury’s Tardis and MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20S. The cost for [WhatsMiner M20S]( is around $3,000, while that of [AntMiner S17 Pro]( is around $4,000 each, based on the information advertised on the two firms’ websites. 
Although orders for these flagship machines have [queued up]( until November and December this year, MicroBT’s founder Zuoxing Yang told CoinDesk previously that the bottleneck of production capacity is the availability of chips from suppliers. 
For example, MicroBT uses 10-nm chips for its M20 series, which are relatively more affordable with a higher level of availability compared to more advanced 7-nm chips used by Bitmain for its AntMiner S17 series equipment. 
While Bitmain has always been relying on chips supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), MicroBT has switched from TSMC to Samsung earlier this year for its flagship products. 
Both [TSMC]( and [Samsung]( have estimated in their most recent Q2 earnings calls that the demand for cryptocurrency mining chips will come back in the third and the fourth quarter this year.

**Bitcoin Outshines Gold Amid Risk Aversion in Financial Markets**
[ 
 
Bitcoin is outperforming gold amid heightened uncertainty in the global markets.
The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading at $11,700, representing 16 percent gains on a month-to-date basis. Meanwhile, gold, the traditional safe-haven asset, has added 6 percent this month.
The precious metal picked up a bid at $1,400 on Aug. 1 as the U.S. President Trump’s decision to escalate trade tensions with China triggered a flight to safety. The S&amp;P 500, a global benchmark for riskier assets, fell 0.90 percent on the same day.
The risk aversion worsened earlier this week when China began allowing the Yuan to depreciate beyond the major psychological level of 7 per U.S. Dollar.
As a result, the S&amp;P 500 fell to a two-month low of $2,822 on Monday and gold extended gains to hit a fresh 2019 high of $1,510 yesterday. Interestingly, bitcoin also found takers near $9,900 on Aug. 1 and rose to a one-month high of $12,325 on Tuesday.
Bitcoin a safe haven?
Bitcoin rising along with gold during times of stress in the global markets indicates the top cryptocurrency is being accepted as a new safe haven, according to CNBC Host [Ran NeuNer](
Further, the recent rise in the leading cryptocurrency coincided with a sharp uptick in the S&amp;P VIX index – Wall Street’s fear gauge, as seen in the chart below. 
 
* VIX rose 10 percent on Aug. 1 and rose to a seven-month high of 24.81 on Monday. As of now, the fear gauge is seen at 17.75.
* Bitcoin jumped from $9,900 to $12,325 in six days to Aug. 6. The rally seems to have stalled with the VIX index pulling back from seven-month highs.
Bitcoin does seem to have found some love as a safe haven if recent price action is anything to go by.
However, there is no long-run correlation between bitcoin, stocks and the US Dollar, as noted by prominent analyst [Mati Greenspan](
In fact, gold and bitcoin have [moved]( in opposite directions in the past.
For instance, BTC dived below the long-held support of $6,000 on Nov, 14, reviving the bear market which had come to a halt near that psychological support in five months to October. By mid-December, BTC was changing hands at 15-month lows near $3,100.
During the same time frame, gold went from $1,200 to $1,300 and further extended the rally to $1,346 (Feb. 20 high). Further, BTC remained in a bear market throughout 2018 despite the trade tensions between the US and China.
All-in-all, it is still too early to say that bitcoin has taken up the role of a safe-haven asset.

**One Of A Kind: Why Bitcoin is 'The Next Bitcoin'**
In this talk, Andreas addresses the speculation about what will be the "next Bitcoin" or the "next Ethereum." Echoing previous talks like 'Invest in Education Instead of Speculation,' he argues that the focus on searching for the best investment or time to buy amid a sea of pump-and-dump schemes is a worse way to spend your time than gathering knowledge about how these systems work. He also tells the story about how he bought bitcoin for the first time, why it is not the get-rich-quick scheme you may think it is, and the ways they could fail.  
This talk was delivered at the Athens' Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech meetup on July 12th 2019 in Athens, Greece.

**Bitcoin Price Rises Above $12K to Hit One-Month High**
[ 
 **View**
* Bitcoin’s move above $12,000 is backed by an uptick in trading volumes and bullish readings on the daily chart.
* BTC could close well above $12,000 today, confirming a falling channel breakout on the daily chart and extend gains toward $13,200 (July 10 high) in the short-term.
* ***The 4-hour chart is reporting overbought conditions and a bearish indicator divergence. So, prices may pull back to $11,800–$11,600 and the bullish UTC close above $12,000 may be delayed till Wednesday.***
* The bullish case would weaken if prices drop below key average support, currently at $10,545, although that looks unlikely.

**VanEck, SolidX Join Forces in New Bid to Launch Bitcoin ETF**
Investment firm VanEck has partnered with financial services company SolidX in their latest attempt to launch the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund.
The companies announced Wednesday that they would list a "physically-backed bitcoin ETF that will be insured against loss or theft of bitcoin."
Under the arrangement, VanEck will market the ETF, while SolidX will act as sponsor, according to a press release. The companies noted that both have previously filed individually to list bitcoin ETFs on various stock exchanges.
VanEck chief executive Jan van Eck said bitcoin is "a legitimate investment option, as a type of 'digital gold' that may make sense for investors' portfolios."
The CEO noted that the ETF has not yet been created, saying "We're pleased to join with [SolidX] in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market." When asked by CoinDesk, he declined to provide details on what assets would be used to back the fund.
Neither SolidX nor VanEck has succeeded in launching a bitcoin ETF to date. As previously reported by CoinDesk, both companies withdrew previous attempts at launching the products at the request of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Van Eck expressed optimism about the fund's potential, despite the regulatory obstacles they have faced, saying:
"We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin."
If approved by regulators, the new ETF would be listed on the CBOE BZX Equities Exchange, according to the release.

**Which Way? Bitcoin's Low Volatility May Force Big Move**
Bitcoin has been squeezed into an increasingly narrow range for more than two weeks and is now experiencing volatility not seen for eight months.
As a result, it's looking likely that bitcoin could soon make a strong move, but the direction it will take when that happens is less than clear. Since May 24, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a range of $7,000–$7,800 range, which is already very tight, but the price has barely moved in the last 36 hours, likely indicating an indecisive market.
Daily volatility, as indicated by the spread between the daily price high and daily price low, fell to $107.63 on Thursday – the lowest level since Oct. 2, 2017 and down 86 percent from the 2018 average of $793, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).
As of writing, prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) are at $7,580, marking around a $100 drop over 24 hours.
A move above $7,819 (50-week moving average) would signal a bullish breakout and would set the tone for a rally to pennant resistance located at $8,880.
On the downside, a break below $7,090 (pennant support) would imply a bearish breakdown. In this case, BTC could potentially drop below $6,000 (Feb low).

**SEC Commissioner Says Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved ‘Eventually’**
A commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) believes a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will ultimately be approved.
Robert J. Jackson Jr., in an interview published by government-focused news source Roll Call on Wednesday, [said](


A number of bitcoin ETF proposals have filed for SEC approval, but none has yet got the green light.
Jay Clayton, chairman of the SEC) has [said]( he doesn’t see a pathway to a cryptocurrency ETF approval until concerns over market manipulation are addressed.
The SEC has to date rejected at least 10 such proposals. Last August, it [turned down]( seven filings from ProShares, Direxion and GraniteShares. A day later, though, the regulator said it [would review]( the proposals.
In July, the SEC for the second time [rejected]( Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’ proposal to list a bitcoin ETF on the Bats BZX Exchange.
Discussing the Winklevoss’ proposal with Roll Call, Jackson said it was “not a difficult case,” but the risk of manipulation and harm to investors was “enormous,” while the market has a “very serious” liquidity problem.
He continued:


Another SEC commissioner has been even more pragmatic over the possibility of a bitcoin ETF. Back in July, Hester Peirce [said]( that the Winklevoss’ proposed rule change “satisfies the statutory standard and that we should permit BZX to list and trade this bitcoin-based exchange-traded product (‘ETP’).”
“From my perspective, we need to be mindful of what our role is, and it’s not to be the ones who decide which innovations and which technologies get through and which ones don’t,” Peirce [told]( CoinDesk soon after.
Today, Peirce [tweeted]( that she looks forward to working with Jackson “to open the doors to innovation.”
The SEC’s rejections have clearly not deterred all from trying to make the ETF breakthrough.
Last month, due to the U.S. government shutdown, Cbeo [withdrew]( its proposed rule change that, if approved, would clear the way for a bitcoin ETF backed by VanEck and SolidX. Days later it [refiled](
Also in January, Bitwise Asset Management [announced]( its plan to launch a bitcoin ETF.

**Bitcoin Surpasses 1 Million Daily Active Addresses**
Bitcoin just passed an interesting milestone today, one we haven’t seen since November 27, 2017. According to [CoinMetrics.io]( there are now over a million daily active addresses, a number that is defined as the number of unique “from” or “to” addresses used per day.
When Bitcoin first broke 1 million active addresses (Nov 27, 2017), 1 BTC was $9,352 and the median tx fee was $3.23.
Yesterday 1 BTC was $8,230 and the median tx fee was $1.33.

**CFTC Approves LedgerX to Settle Futures in Real Bitcoin.**
 [ 
 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has cleared bitcoin derivatives provider LedgerX to offer physically settled bitcoin futures contracts.
The CFTC [said Tuesday]( it had approved [LedgerX’s]( application for a [designated contract market]( (DCM) license, meaning the company can now offer the new futures contracts. LedgerX is the second company to receive approval to offer physically settled bitcoin futures; other firms, such as Intercontinental Exchange’s [Bakkt]( [Seed CX]( and [ErisX]( plan to enter this market. (While Bakkt’s own futures contracts have been self-certified, the firm is waiting for the [New York Department of Financial Services]( to license its [warehouse](
Unlike the cash-settled bitcoin futures listed by the Chicago exchanges Cboe and CME, in physically settled futures the buyer receives the underlying commodity when a contract expires, rather than the fiat equivalent.
Monday’s approval means that New York-based LedgerX can not only list these bitcoin futures contracts but crucially can offer its products to retail clients, not just institutional ones.
No timeline was provided for when LedgerX might start to offer futures. but chief operating and risk officer Juthica Chou told CoinDesk that the company was looking to be the first provider of this product in the U.S.
“There’s no doubt that we’re looking to be first, we’re looking to be the incumbent,” she said. “We think we’re better positioned and we want to be there to serve customers of all sizes.”
LedgerX would follow the same self-certification process that it already underwent to offer swaps and options, Chou said, adding:


While Bakkt has previously announced that it would be testing its own physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts in July, a firm launch date has yet to be announced. Seed CX and ErisX have likewise not yet announced when they would launch their futures products (or forwards, in Seed CX’s case).
 Months-long process
LedgerX applied for the DCM [in November 2018]( and has since been working with the CFTC. It already offers swaps and options contracts for customers.
The DCM application came on top of LedgerX’s existing Swap Execution Facility (SEF) and Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) licenses, which approve the company’s exchange platform and clearinghouse, respectively.
The new license carries with it the same set of responsibilities that the other two have, Chou said, though securing the latest approval “was a pretty difficult process” due to the issues involved.
LedgerX is now eyeing a gradual rollout of its new products, including its retail-focused Omni platform.
“We want to be careful and conservative so we’ll soft-launch the Omni product,” she said. “We’ll take customer feedback and we’ll make sure it works.”
The company will roll out its existing swaps and options product to all customers, as well as a new block height option product which the company recently self-certified.
Chou added:

**Fiat-to-Crypto ‘Carry Trade’ May Tempt Traders Tired of Negative Interest Rates**
[ 
 
With the era of negative interest rates well and truly here, return-hungry investors may increasingly borrow in low-interest fiat currencies and invest in higher-yielding cryptocurrency accounts.
“The fiat-BTC carry trade is the next step in bitcoin growth,” tweeted popular bitcoin quant investor [ on Oct. 10.
A carry trade is a strategy where a trader uses a low-yielding currency to fund a high-yielding investment.
For instance, the yen carry trade was popular in 2004-2008 when the Federal Reserve hiked rates from 1 percent to 5.25 percent and interest rates in Japan were stuck near 0.5 percent.
Investors borrowed in yen to fund dollar-denominated investments. As a result, the yen weakened by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar.
Currently, the carry trade in the FX markets is pretty much dead with almost every advanced nation having interest rates at or below zero.
But that situation bodes well for a new type of carry trade with a crypto twist.
 Lucrative lending…
On the lending side, crypto-asset platforms like Binance, Crypto.com, Celsius Network, BlockFi are paying interest rates on cryptocurrency deposits. They fund this with interest earned from credit lines extended to margin traders and hedgers.
The interest rates are subject to fluctuations, either modified by the platform operator or influenced by the supply-demand mechanics of users interacting with the platform.
For instance, the Bitfinex exchange pays an annual interest rate of 0.66 percent interest on bitcoin deposits and [provides loans]( at 0.59 percent, according to CoinMarketCap’s new [Interest]( tracker.
In a sense, Bitfinex is operating as a commercial bank by charging a higher rate on loans and paying relatively less on deposits. (Think of the old 3-6-3 rule: “borrow at 3 percent, lend at 6 percent, hit the golf course at 3” – except unlike a bank, crypto exchanges never close.)
While Bitfinex is offering 0.66 percent, other platforms are paying significantly higher interest rates on bitcoin deposits.
 
One possible reason for the disparity is that like a demand deposit at a bank, Bitfinex allows customers to withdraw at any time, whereas other crypto platforms require the money to be locked up for a period for weeks or months. Crypto.com, for instance, is paying 6 percent, but deposits need to be maintained at least for 90 days.
Then again, BlockFi also allows withdrawals any time (it even removed an early withdrawal penalty, allowing one free withdrawal per month) and it is offering an annual interest rate of 6.20 percent.
Meanwhile, crypto lending provider Nexo [is offering]( up to 8 percent yield on deposits of stablecoins DAI, USD Coin (USDC), Paxos Standard (PAX), TrueUSD (TUSD) and Tether (USDT). Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar.
 …and cheap borrowing
The annual interest rates paid by crypto lending platforms are significantly higher than the rates across the advanced world.
Central banks in Europe and Japan are running a negative interest rate policy (NIRP), under which financial institutions are required to pay an interest rate for parking excess reserves with the central bank.
The Swiss National Bank, which introduced negative rates in 2015, currently has the lowest rate in the world at -0.75 percent.  The Bank of Japan (BOJ) cut rates to -0.1 percent in January 2016 and has been running the negative interest rate policy ever since.
The yield of  -0.12 percent seen on the 10-year Japanese government bond is the side effect of BOJ’s market-distorting policies.
Also, corporate debt yields have recently hit unprecedented lows. For instance, Toyota Finance Corp will be issuing three-year notes at an unprecedented low yield of 0.0000000091 percent, according to [Bloomberg]( It means a trader buying 1 billion yen of the bonds would not even make 1 yen on maturity.
The situation is somewhat better for investors in the U.S. and U.K., where the target short-term rates set by the central bank stand at 1.75 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively. The benchmark 10-year government bond yields, however, are significantly lower than the interest rates paid by the likes of Nexo and Celsius Network.
More importantly, central banks running NIRP are unlikely to normalize their policy anytime soon, given the bleak outlook for the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently [slashed]( its 2019 global growth forecast to 6 percent – the lowest since 2008.
All-in-all, interest rates across the globe are low and could slide further, boosting the allure of high-yielding crypto deposits.
**Halving factor**
Aside from the interest rate differential, there’s another reason borrowing fiat to buy bitcoin could pay off.
In May of next year, the amount of new bitcoin awarded to miners every 10 minutes or so will be cut in half for the third time in the cryptocurrency’s history. Historically, reward halvings have boded well for bitcoin’s price.
The next halving could reduce the amount of new bitcoin added to the market by $51 million per week at current prices, according to [Alistair Milne]( chief investment officer of Altana Digital Currency Fund.
As of writing, BTC is trading above $8,200, representing 120 percent gains on a year-to-date basis.
And, if the carry trade becomes popular, all else equal BTC should appreciate sharply against the USD, the way the greenback did against the Japanese Yen.

 **Bitcoin Price Charts Offer Glimmer of Hope to Struggling Bulls**
 
 View
* Bitcoin has charted a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. A break above $3,450 would confirm a wedge breakout and expose key resistance lined up at $3,658 (the high of the gravestone doji candle created on Jan. 26). A violation there would expose the psychological resistance of $4,000.
* The prospects of a falling wedge breakout would weaken if the cryptocurrency suffers a channel breakdown on the 4-hour chart.
The slow drip bitcoin (BTC) price sell-off seen over the last six weeks has produced a bullish pattern on the daily chart.
The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently down more than 20 percent from highs above $4,200 seen on Dec. 24. The pullback may have reinforced the primary bearish trend, as represented by the long-term moving average studies.
Still, all is not lost for the bulls, as the lower highs and lower lows created over the last six weeks have converged, creating a downward sloping cone or a falling wedge on the daily chart.
The falling wedge is a bullish reversal pattern, that is, the price will often break above the upper edge of the pattern and rally. A breakout, if confirmed, could open the doors for a strong corrective move.
As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,400 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.66 percent drop on the day. The falling wedge resistance is seen at $3,450.

Maybe what I posted from Investopedia is simplified and I'm no expert, far from it.
All I'm really saying is that Bitcoin is a speculative and very volatile investment, it obviously has the potential to return a profit in the future but also could tank and go very low.
Obviously no one knows what will happen in the future but I personally believe we have some way to go still.
If you're happy with your decision I say good luck to you.

Many people expected a correction as it was going up way too fast...I personally think it will be great if we can stay around $12.5k for a few days.

I woke up and started the day by switching my computer on, I was half asleep and saw 7900 but all that registered was the 900 part and I presumed it was back at 8900.  So I was happy for a few seconds......
I then realised we were down at 7 thousand nine hundred!   :(

You said this "Why Bitcoin is NOT an Investment, and that's Okay
First, let's talk about what an investment is. By definition, an investment is an asset that yields a return above its purchase price.
If you invest in bonds or equities, you're usually looking at some kind of discounted cash-flow to decide whether to invest or not. Either your bond will pay a coupon of $X per year, or your company will generate $X amount of cash annually - and you project these values over time. Then you compare that to the return on less risky assets, like the US 10 year Treasury, and decide if the return is worth the risk.
But bitcoin doesn't yield anything. No matter what industries it disrupts or entrenched powers it destroys, it will never yield anything. If you own 1 BTC today, it's still 1 BTC in the future without any dividends, coupons, or splits. By definition, it cannot be an investment - there's no return. Non-yielding assets can never be an investment."
but Bitcoin has already yielded extra coins with Bcash and BGold so it is an investment?

This is from Blockchain :
Our block explorer, Blockchain.info, has supported SegWit from the day it activated. In 2018 we will be rolling out support for SegWit within our wallet products. This will be a major and complex update to some of the most sensitive parts of our codebase, across a wide variety of platforms and devices, affecting billions in user transactions with potentially significant privacy implications. We will do this cautiously but also with consideration for the rising miner’s fees within the bitcoin ecosystem. We are excited about the advances SegWit offers and we plan to begin making it available within our wallets in as soon as possible in 2018, with an eye towards rollout in Q1."

I'm probably not being that clear, what I'm trying to understand in my own head is....with a Blockchain non-custodial wallet...Blockchain does not know my seed and equally with a Trezor...Trezor does not know my seed.
So are they not the same level of security?

**More good news for Bitcoin.**
The CEO of the Man Group, a major U.K.-based hedge fund, is reportedly eyeing an entry into the cryptocurrency space in light of a pending derivatives product launch by CME Group.
According to Reuters, CEO Luke Ellis indicated that if the CME proceeds with its plans to list a bitcoin futures contract – possibly as early as next month – the hedge fund that claims more than $100 billion in assets under management could make cryptocurrency as part of its "investment universe."
The chief executive was quoted as saying:
"It's not part of our investment universe today – it could be. If there is a CME future on bitcoin, it would be."
In the event that the Man Group makes the proverbial leap to investing in cryptocurrencies – Ellis didn't offer any clues beyond the hint related to CME – it would be the latest firm of its kind of enter the market.
His remarks come on the heels of CME announcing that it would launch its bitcoin product by the end of 2017. At the time it announced the product, the company was still waiting on approval from regulators. CME Group CEO Terry Duffy then made waves earlier this week when he said that the futures contract could launch as soon as mid-December.

That's the thing, people that said Bitcoin was a scam back in 2017 probably still think that way, atleast a lot of them.
I wonder IF Bitcoin reaches say $100k in 10 years time they will still think it's a scam.....

 Bitcoin’s emergence as a global digital currency has been as revolutionary as it has been erratic. But while fledgling investors obsess over every fluctuation in the cryptocurrency market, nation-states are more interested in the underlying blockchain technology and its ability to revolutionize how business is done on the internet and beyond. VICE's Michael Moynihan travels to Russia with Vitalik Buterin, inventor of the Ethereum blockchain, to get a front-row seat to the geopolitical tug of war over Internet 3.0.

I would say it all depends on how much you have and also how much that value is in relation to your total wealth.
Say you have $1000 of Bitcoin on coinbase and you have say $30,000 total wealth, in my opinion leave it on coinbase.  
If you have $100,000 on coinbase and your total wealth is $300,000, get it off coinbase asap.

**Bitcoin too small to threaten world economy, says Bank of England deputy**
Bitcoin is too small to pose a risk to the global economy, according to a senior Bank of England executive, as the cryptocurrency passed the $10,000 barrier for the first time.
Bitcoin has risen tenfold in value so far this year, the largest gain of all asset classes, prompting sceptics to declare it a classic speculative bubble. The digital currency topped $10,800 (£8,060) on Wednesday morning.
The rapid growth in the value and popularity of the virtual currency, which emerged in the aftermath of the financial crisis and allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods to pay for goods and services, has forced central banks, financial regulators and institutions to consider how to respond.
What is bitcoin and is it a bad investment?
Sir Jon Cunliffe, the BoE deputy governor, told BBC Radio 5 Live: “This is not a currency in the accepted sense. There’s no central bank that stands behind it. For me it’s much more like a commodity.
“This is not at a size where it’s a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.”
Banks and other financial institutions have been concerned about bitcoin’s early associations with money laundering and online crime, and it has not been adopted by any government.
The JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has described bitcoin as “worse than tulips”, in reference to a famous market bubble from the 1600s. Speaking in September, Dimon said the digital currency was a fraud that would ultimately blow up, adding it was only fit for use by drug dealers, murderers and people living in places such as North Korea.
However, according to reports last week, JP Morgan is considering whether to help its own clients bet on the price of bitcoin through proposed futures contracts to be offered by CME Group. The bank would collect fees for providing such a service.
Dennis de Jong, the managing director at the online currency broker UFX, said the value of the cryptocurrency was likely to rise further.
“Until bitcoin becomes a commonly used payment source, it’s very possible that it could hit $15,000 and beyond based on its current desirability,” he said. “If bitcoin falls into wider circulation, and becomes accepted into more conventional funds and exchanges, we are likely to see a normalisation of its value.”

The recent Baltic Honeybadger 2017 conference in Riga, Latvia featured an all star panel of Bitcoin developers and security experts on the second day of the event. During this panel, the participants were asked to explain what kinds of possible issues with Bitcoin keep them up at night.
In their responses, the panel of Ciphrex CEO and Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo, Blockstream CEO Adam Back, JoinMarket developer Adam Gibson, applied cryptography consultant and sometimes Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd, SatoshiLabs CTO Pavol Rusnak, and Libbitcoin lead maintainer Eric Voskuil discussed the issues with the recent phenomenon of spinoff coins, a lack of understanding as to why Bitcoin is useful, and the fact that some of them sleep better today than they did in the early days of this new technology.
Spinoff Coins are the Key Issue of Today
A few of the panelists talked about the recent proliferation of spinoff coins when asked what keeps them up at night. Lombrozo referred to them as initial fork offerings (IFOs), which is a play on the initial coin offering (ICO) hysteria that has also taken place this year.
These spin-off coins are basically new altcoins that have been created at a certain block height of the Bitcoin blockchain. Everyone who held bitcoin at that block height also gets access to the new altcoin.
“I’m a little bit concerned because it means there’s all this supposed value that people have in their wallets that they don’t really know how to access, can’t access, can’t access securely, have to sacrifice privacy [to access], or [deal with] tax liabilities potentially,” said Lombrozo.
This had led Lombrozo to work on a project known as Chainsplit, which will focus on making it as easy as possible to trade coins that are made available through these various Bitcoin spin-offs, which should help improve price discovery.
“It’s basically a denial of service attack on developers,” Lombrozo added in terms of the effect of spin-off coins on the Bitcoin development community.
 
In Lombrozo’s view, it would be nice if it were easier to add support for these spin-off coins in various wallets and exchanges without compromising user security.
Building on Lombrozo’s points, Back said the risky part about Bitcoin involves connecting to the internet, and in his view, these new forks open up new security vulnerabilities because they usually require users to download new software to access the coins.
“It’s a window of vulnerability that’s advertised in advance, so it’s a time to be very careful about what you’re downloading,” said Back “Unfortunately, that means there’s a real risk that’s attached to the forks. There are certainly people out there who have old coins that are not interested to collect these spin-offs for security and privacy reasons.”
To Back’s point, more than $3 million worth of bitcoin was recently stolen via a malicious Bitcoin Gold wallet that was linked on the official Bitcoin Gold website, according to CoinDesk.
Todd also discussed the problems associated with possibly-malicious software that is not audited by those who are running it in his remarks, although he focused on a different part of the ecosystem.
“[What worries me is] people holding bitcoins for other people at exchanges and so forth where their entire build system is, for instance, a bunch of Docker containers, and [for] every Docker container, the build process starts with things like, Wget some random, unauthenticated website,’” said Todd. “Realistically, that’s going to be a vulnerability.”
As a specific example of this issue of bitcoin custodians or other important players in the ecosystem not verifying the code they’re using for critical processes, Todd pointed to his own participation in the ZCash trusted setup where he famously went the extra mile (literally) and drove across Canada with a faraday cage and multiple cameras.
“The reality is: All that went to waste because their build process for the Zcash software was trivially backdoorable,” said Todd. “The whole thing was built off an Alpine Linux distribution and Rust compiler that were built earlier that month — in the case of the Rust compiler, the day before. And no one new exactly what went into that software. No deterministic builds, no nothing.”
 The Root Cause of Forks is a Misunderstanding of Bitcoin
While the recent spin-off tokens were the main topic of conversation on the surface, some developers also pointed out that the root cause of this new issue is a lack of understanding in terms of Bitcoin’s useful properties.
“I’m worried that people don’t understand what Bitcoin is, and that’s kind of the root of all of this, including all the forks,” said Gibson. “The developers, the people who work on the technology, are delivering what I think Bitcoin realistically is, but people want kind of unicorns and they want like kind of free transactions and a billion transactions a second. And that’s, I think, where all this is coming from.”
Todd also hit on this point during his own remarks, where he referred to the social problems that are caused by the lack of scalability seen in Bitcoin today.
“Bitcoin forces us to make these terrible tradeoffs between cost and security,” said Todd. “I think, at the social level, that’s a security problem because we keep getting attacks driven by people who just want transactions to be cheaper in exchange for the system to be less secure.”
From Voskuil’s perspective, the scalability, privacy, and other issues in Bitcoin will eventually be worked out, but it’s going to take longer than it should because of this, in his view, misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works.
“What bothers me is there’s a lot of misapprehension about how Bitcoin actually secures itself, which means how it works,” said Voskuil.
Still Sleeping Better Than Before
It should be noted that two developers on the panel, Lombrozo and Rusnak, pointed out that they sleep better today than they did a few years ago, mainly due to the progress made in private key management.
“I’d say I’m sleeping pretty well now,” said Lombrozo, whose company Ciphrex is built around secure private key management. “A couple of years ago, maybe not so much.”
For Rusnak, the main thing that keeps him up at night is all of the people asking for SatoshiLabs to support random altcoins in the Trezor hardware wallet.
“We came up with the hardware wallet idea exactly because we wanted to have good sleep at night, so I’m having a pretty good sleep since then,” said Rusnak.

Big money is coming to bitcoin: ex-Fortress executive Novogratz
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mike Novogratz, the former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group who has joined the mad dash for crypto-currencies, said on Monday that mainstream institutional investors are about six to eight months from adopting bitcoin.
Novogratz said he expects major financial firms will soon start to offer bitcoin or similar products as an investment option, one that could be easily purchased over the phone.
A turning-point product from a big financial firm could arrive within six months, he said, though he declined to name a specific company.
“When it’s that easy, the price of bitcoin or ethereum is going to go much higher. And that is a lot closer than people think,” said Novogratz, who spoke at the Reuters Global 2018 Investment Outlook Summit in New York.
Novogratz is now chief executive of Galaxy Investment Partners, a firm that bets on cryptocurrencies and related businesses.
“The institutionalization of this space is coming. It’s coming pretty quick,” he said.
For the most part though, institutional investors have stayed away from bitcoin BTC=BTSP, the original and largest crypto-currency in terms of market capitalization, despite outperforming all the world's traditional currencies.
Traditional investors still view bitcoin as opaque and highly speculative with potential to collapse even though so far this year bitcoin has soared nearly 580 percent.
Bitcoin surged on Monday to $6,487, recovering more than $1,000 after losing almost a third of its value in less than four days as traders bought back into the volatile cryptocurrency.
It hit a record peak last week just shy of $8,000.
During the latest pullback over the weekend though, Novogratz said he bought $15 million to $20 million worth of bitcoins.
Early enthusiasts for the crypto-currency were drawn to its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control. The risks of dealing in bitcoin were laid bare in 2013 when Tokyo-based exchange Mt Gox collapsed after admitting it had lost the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds.
The currency’s earlier ties to gambling and criminal websites did not endear it to traditional investors.
But bitcoin has since overcome some of those challenges. “We’re past that,” he said.
BIGGEST REGRET FOR 2017
Novogratz’s biggest regret this year has been not buying more cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, when prices fell, because he knew that they would keep going up.
Ethereum is another public blockchain, essentially a shared database, similar to that of bitcoin. Ethereum’s token is called ether.
He felt that he made a psychological mistake, comparing the original price he paid to ethereum’s value over the summer. “When it was time to buy it back, I didn’t buy enough back,” he said.
He sees bitcoin, for instance, hitting $10,000 by March.
The former Fortress executive recently created his own crypto-hedge fund, putting in about $100 million of his own money. He hopes to raise about $500 million, making it the largest fund of its kind.
Novogratz said Galaxy’s largest investment is in bitcoin. It has a “very big” holding of ethereum and about 30-35 different tokens and companies. He declined to give the percentages of each holding, citing competitive reasons.
One of those investments is in the token sale of Worldwide Asset Exchange, an online marketplace for so-called “skins,” which are essentially virtual accessories of video game characters. The total market for “skins” is $50 billion.
The skins don’t have much application except to change how a character or a weapon looks.
He is also an investor in FunFair, a decentralized gaming platform.
FORTRESS EXIT
Novogratz, a former Princeton University wrestler, U.S. Army helicopter pilot, and Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) partner, is best known as a swaggering “macro” investor in the mold of George Soros who made big wagers on global economic movements.
Novogratz worked at Fortress from 2002 to 2015, where he was a principal and ran its macro hedge funds. They grew to manage billions of dollars and made “Novo” a Wall Street star. But the funds were shut in 2015 following investment losses. Novogratz retired from the firm.
“Very few people have graceful exits from Wall Street. Mine wasn’t as graceful as I would have liked,” he told Reuters.
After Fortress, Novogratz planned to focus running his own money and avoid the complications of external investors. But he fell in love with the promise of blockchain technology after successfully investing in bitcoin, ethereum and other assets.
He has quickly become one of the most prominent advocates of blockchain and has been working to convince larger, more conservative asset managers to get involved.
“It’s potentially wildly disruptive and revolutionary,” Novogratz said.

# Bitcoin Is Now Officially In Its Longest Bear Market Ever
 
Bitcoin has officially entered the longest stretch of declining prices in its 10-year history.
The world’s oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency achieved an all-time high of $19,764 on Dec. 17, 2017 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index and has printed a series of lower price highs ever since, making February 2 (as per UTC time), the 411th consecutive day prices have been in decline. 
As such, bitcoin’s latest stretch surpasses the duration of the infamous 2013-2015 bitcoin bear market, which spanned 410 days from its price high to low.

What is an 'Investment'
An investment is an asset or item that is purchased with the hope that it will generate income or will appreciate in the future. In an economic sense, an investment is the purchase of goods that are not consumed today but are used in the future to create wealth. In finance, an investment is a monetary asset purchased with the idea that the asset will provide income in the future or will be sold at a higher price for a profit.
Come on Bitcoin is an investment.  I don't see how you can argue against that!?

Today’s gain was probably triggered by an order worth about $100 million spread across U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and Luxembourg’s Bitstamp, said Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, chief executive of cryptocurrency firm BCB Group.
“There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC,” he said.
“If you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges – there were in-concert, synchronized, units of volume of around 7,000 BTC in an hour”.

Bitcoin Drops Below $12K After Biggest Daily Price Move Since January 2018
 [ 
 
 View
* Bitcoin’s price volatility, as represented by the daily trading range, jumped to a 17-month high on Wednesday.
* The cryptocurrency has dropped from $13,880 to $11,200 in the last 15 hours and could slide further to $10,000, according to the bearish setup on the hourly chart.
* A possible falling channel breakout on the hourly chart would open the doors to a retest of Wednesday’s high of $13,880.
* **The outlook on the long duration charts remains bullish.**
 
Bitcoin is witnessing a technical correction a day after printing the biggest one-day trading range since January 2018.
The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $11,780, representing a 15 percent drop from the 17-month high of $13,880 hit on Wednesday.
The double-digit pullback has come after a near 90-degree price rise from $7,500 to $13,800 in the 17 days to June 26 and looks like nothing more than a technical correction.
After all, indicators were flashing extremely overbought conditions 24-hours ago. For instance, the widely tracked 14-week relative strength index was hovering at levels last seen in January 2018, as [discussed yesterday](
However, despite the pullback, BTC is still up 183 percent on a quarter-to-date basis, its best three-month performance since the final quarter of 2017.
What’s even more notable is that the magnitude of the daily price moves is reminiscent of the cryptocurrency market frenzy of January 2018.
The spread between the daily price high and low was $2,041 on Wednesday – the highest since Jan. 17, 2018. Back then, BTC witnessed a trading range of $2,275 with prices printing a high and low of $11,678 and $9,402, respectively, according to data source [CoinMarketCap](
 
* The daily trading range has jumped above $2,000 for the first time in over 17 months.
* **The $4,110 spread seen on Dec. 22, 2017, is the highest to date.**
* The average daily trading range of $358 seen so far this quarter marks a 311-percent rise on the average daily range of $87 seen in Q1.
Volatility, as represented by daily price range, has surged in the second quarter and may remain high in coming months, with [experts predicting a parabolic rise]( to fresh record highs over $20,000.
Bitcoin, however, may witness a deeper short-term correction in the next day or two, according to the intraday charts.
 
**The bullish higher-lows and higher-highs structure is intact on both the daily and weekly charts.**
**The 5- and 10-day MAs continue to trend north, indicating a bullish setup, and could restrict losses. The averages are currently located at $11,666 and $10,713.**
**Both the falling channel breakout and the bullish crossover of the 5- and 10-month MAs also indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side.**

I think almost everyone that knows anything about Bitcoin will now admit that there is manipulation going on in the markets almost everyday but it goes both ways, up and down.  
Logic would make me think that the long term plan is to go up.  Whales don't want their stacks to be worthless.

Bullish scenario: A high volume break above $11,000 in the next 72 hours would mean the sell-off from March 5 high of $11,700 has bottomed out around $9,577 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) and could yield a much-awaited bullish break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance.

"My favorite fact of it all is the media and skeptics were all saying “it’s a bubble” when bitcoin originally had reached an ATH of $3000usd in August of 2017..and then we all saw it reach $20k shortly after..so what it’s went down from that. It went down to $6k in February and then would go back up to $12k within weeks and yes we are back down to $6k yet again, but consider the Dec/Jan boom as a sudden sprint that bitcoin took for the first time in years without any conditioning prior and now these downs and ups are just heavy breaths after the sprint. And the next sprint will be for the gold medal this year, next year, or someday in the next decade without a doubt in my mind I’m not saying btc will in fact be equivalent to $1million one day but I do most certainly believe in it’s potential to reach above $100k. due to the trends of it’s exponential growth in the past decade. It is an odd analogy I know but I don’t see any roller coaster memes much these days. All we await for is a brilliant mind to figure out a simple way to make security habitual and easy to utilize on a smart phone that has blockchain technology default on smart phones sort of like Apple Pay. When that day comes and consumer stores like Walmart implement the tech we will look back on these days and wonder why we even sweated a drop. And maybe I am wrong entirely but that’s a partial bit of my vision with it all."

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 Economies, also resisted calls from some G20 members to regulate cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.
Interest in cryptocurrencies surged last year as prices rocketed only to tumble in recent months, triggering warnings from regulators.
But in a sign of too little consensus for radical action, the FSB said more international coordination was needed to plug data gaps in monitoring the rapidly evolving but still tiny sector worth less than 1 percent of global GDP at its peak.
“The FSB’s initial assessment is that crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time,” FSB Chair Mark Carney said in a letter to G20 central bankers and finance ministers who will meet in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday.
Carney, who stands down next year when his term as governor of the Bank of England ends, signaled that whoever succeeds him would be overseeing a more open watchdog focused on reviewing rules instead of pushing through new standards.
“As its work to fix the fault lines that caused the financial crisis draws to a close, the FSB is increasingly pivoting away from design of new policy initiatives towards dynamic implementation and rigorous evaluation of the effects of the agreed G20 reforms,” Carney said.

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 Economies, also resisted calls from some G20 members to regulate cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.
Interest in cryptocurrencies surged last year as prices rocketed only to tumble in recent months, triggering warnings from regulators.
But in a sign of too little consensus for radical action, the FSB said more international coordination was needed to plug data gaps in monitoring the rapidly evolving but still tiny sector worth less than 1 percent of global GDP at its peak.
“The FSB’s initial assessment is that crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time,” FSB Chair Mark Carney said in a letter to G20 central bankers and finance ministers who will meet in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday.
Carney, who stands down next year when his term as governor of the Bank of England ends, signaled that whoever succeeds him would be overseeing a more open watchdog focused on reviewing rules instead of pushing through new standards.
“As its work to fix the fault lines that caused the financial crisis draws to a close, the FSB is increasingly pivoting away from design of new policy initiatives towards dynamic implementation and rigorous evaluation of the effects of the agreed G20 reforms,” Carney said.

**Bitcoin Eyes Bottom After 50-Day Low Below $7K**
Bitcoin (BTC) prices dropped to a 50-day low of $6,630 earlier today, but a glimmer of good news for the bulls is that the cryptocurrency appears to be nearing a bottom.
To start with, BTC tends to reverse course every time the relative strength index (RSI) drops to or below 30.00, according to historical data (see chart below). As of writing, the relative strength index is close to that mark, at 32.00.
God I hope we have hit the bottom!

Bitcoin looks set to test the $10,000 mark soon, as per technical analysis, although some investors fear the Lunar New Year may play spoilsport.
Ahead of New Year holidays (starting Feb. 15), Chinese and South Koreans often exchange bitcoin for fiat currencies (to fund increased spending), and bitcoin (BTC) tends to drop in the run-up to the event.
Boosting such fears this year is bitcoin's (BTC) recent inability to move above $9,000 in a convincing manner. Since Feb. 10, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrow range of $8,000 to $9,000, shows CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

# The Coming Bifurcation of Bitcoin
 
*Angus Champion de Crespigny is an advisor to blockchain projects and a former EY blockchain lead.*
*The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s* [*2018 Year in Review*]( 
 
Amongst many others, the bitcoin community for the past few years has been working with two particularly important ideas related to the asset’s future.
One is the narrative of institutional adoption: the idea that institutions will begin buying (or facilitating the buying) of [bitcoin]( as an investment. The other is decentralization: emphasizing control of one’s own monetary sovereignty and the ease with which people can participate in the network at an affordable cost.
While both are important in their own ways, considering how institutions operate, it is likely that these two narratives are going to conflict. This does not need to be a problem, however. What we’re likely to see is a bifurcation in bitcoin usage throughout the world for different purposes, and consequently, how it is handled.
 The Institutionalization of Bitcoin
This thesis comes from a number of different directions.
There is what I’ll call the “hard money” thesis: that bitcoin will be recognized as a superior form of money due to its monetary policy and will be adopted en masse by institutional investors. In this case, these investors are the likes of pension funds, endowment funds, insurers and, possibly, central banks.
Part of institutional adoption, however, is looking beyond the underlying benefits of the asset, and into whether there’s an appetite for people to buy, sell, hold and trade bitcoin. Where there is an appetite for a financial asset, institutions will facilitate. In this case, the investors will also include individuals.
The challenge faced by institutions in working with bitcoin in either instance, though, is that financial instruments for institutions need to be boring. Institutions rarely custody their own assets. Over many years, custody functions have been centralized with specialized institutions in the financial sector, who will hold the assets and perform all management functions that are needed on behalf of the ultimate asset owners.
But for bitcoin, custody is challenging, and not just for the technical reason that private keys need to be secure.
How do institutions manage forks? Do they need a central clearing function to offset risk? How do they manage sanctions risks for transaction fees if a block is mined by a miner in a sanctioned country?
For institutions to hold the keys is rarely operationally sensible: few financial institutions have the expertise in-house nor have the appetite to take on such a technically complex process.
Consequently, for institutions to get on board with bitcoin, these issues will need to be addressed, and they will likely be addressed in the same way that the management of financial instruments usually are – with standards and centralized products. These standards may define what forks to accept and processes to follow to manage sanctions risks, which the industry will want to ensure is in line with peers to manage perceptions to clients and regulators.
Centralized products managed by specialized companies may include custodians and clearing houses: we’re starting to see this already.
While there is opposition to this centralization, and in particular how certain custodians manage forks, the reality is that few financial institutions, at least in the short term, have a desire to undertake this side of digital asset management. Many seasoned bitcoiners object to this centralization. And rightly so, at a technical level.
What’s the point in censorship resistant money if you standardize and centralize it such that it can be censored?
 Censorship-Resistant Money
As recently covered in [Time]( bitcoin is effective for freedom because it allows people to store money away from a government they don’t trust. If there is a demand to keep money away from the government and bitcoin is effective in doing that, then naturally countries to which this is applicable will wish to restrict its usage.
We have already seen such controls with Zimbabwe and China. For such usage, bitcoin must be decentralized.
Centralized custodians, clearing houses, and standards organizations can be influenced by such jurisdictions through law enforcement and consequently will not be held up to be censorship resistant.
Now, if bitcoin for some reason is not effective as a tool for freedom, it is unlikely to adopted as such, in which case this whole discussion is moot. As much as I can probably assume that the reader is a fan of bitcoin and bullish for its eventual disruptive power, we should be pragmatic about the obstacles to it being adopted as a store of value.
It will need to significantly improve in its ease of use, particularly around key management. It will need a reduction in perceived volatility, and liquidity in these countries that need censorship resistant money, that by their nature likely have capital controls restricting money movement.
Ultimately, we will need a shift in perception to bitcoin being seen as a store of value on par with or superior to gold – which is no mean feat in itself. So while I’m optimistic we can get there, we may well have a long road.
If Bitcoin is successful in achieving this status, the logical conclusion is that we would expect bitcoin to hold a dual status globally. In countries where people have greater faith in the rule of law and central banks, censorship resistance is less attractive, and thus bitcoin could be seen as an investible commodity akin to gold with the majority of assets held in centralized institutions.
In parts of the world under oppressive regimes, however, bitcoin may be closer to an illegal or at the very least highly restricted asset, where there would need to be a greater emphasis and need of self-management of wallets and keys.
It would certainly be exciting if it was use in those countries that drove the price for the rest of the world.
Centralization of bitcoin products and services are not in and of themselves bad, as there will be a different demand for the asset from different markets. It is critical, however, that bitcoin at its base remains a decentralized, censorship-resistant medium of value transfer and storage: as without censorship resistance, we don’t have an innovation at all.

The Corrosion of Ethics in Cryptocurrencies
I work on Bitcoin (currently: Lightning Network), continuing a 20 year career of Free/Open Source Software development. I love the developers and the project, but sometimes I despair of the environment.
I wrote rant which my more level-headed colleagues advised me not to post, but this issue is one I feel strongly about, which won’t go away: we are beset by scammers, attracted by the “free” money. If we compare ourselves to them, it will inevitably lower our ethical and moral standards until we do something abhorrent to our former selves.
Ever been tempted to start an altcoin? Launch an ICO? Or simply lend your technical credibility to one? You can put mitigations and disclaimers in place, you can make arguments as to why your case is different from all the others, but that promise of easy money will get to you. Even if you were pure as snow, those around you assuredly won’t be, and none of us is immune from our environment. Even in the bitcoin community, which often looks staid compared to the debacles of altcoins and ICOs, it’s a slippery slope. When you’ve got outright scammers who steal user funds, lesser debacles can seem minor, especially behavior which doesn’t break any actual laws.
Let’s take a concrete example. I’ve still not sold my bitcoin gold, perhaps I should add a mention of bitcoin gold to the lightning spec before I do? That certainly helped pump litecoin, and it’s only a few minutes’ work! If you consider that transparent pumping, what if I actually modify c-lightning so it can run on bitcoin gold? How much work would I have to do to justify to myself that I’m not just pumping to make money? How much disclosure would I have to give? In this case it’s not enough money to be worth the time, but it made me realize: if my statements or actions are motivated mainly by personal gain, no amount of disclosure makes me feel comfortable.
But in this environment, actual ethical behavior looks suspicious. It’s not really believable that I would pass up significant gains for some altruistic reason, is it?
In my defense, I’ve chosen to remain hacking my entire career rather than create a startup or go all biz, though that’s where the Big Money is. I’m pretty well-paid for this, because of my record: that same reputation has gained me the respect of my peers, and which I trade on to get their time, consideration and attention, whether I’m looking for a job or asking dumb questions.
It’s awesome, and I can’t conceive of enough money to compensate for that, but I don’t think any statements I make can prevent me being lumped with the broader “cryptos” ecosystem. If this worries you too, let’s make sure we keep each other honest, OK?

The entire ecosphere really feels like a wet dog, that is trying to get dry again. What does he do? Shake his fucking body. That's exactly what is happening whenever Bitcoin moves either direction at the moment.
Bitcoin loses value, Alt lose double/tripple their value.
Bitcoin wins value, Alts cannot keep up with gains from Bitcoin.
This is why, despite going down and sinking hard, the dominance is almost going up faster than before, now being close to 46%. Gotta give it to the dips man, they're healthy for Crypto it really does feel like it. All the hype is shaken off all of these ICOs that haven't delivered a single thing, but a white paper, but are worth billions of dollars?
All recent news is good and Bitcoin will probably exit g20 on a positive note, and who will not leave on a positive note or at least is heavily endagered? ICOs.
Seems like that dominance going back up could this time be a more long'ish trend. At first Ithought we'd see a stop 48%, but this really looks like, with a BTC bullrun always coming first, we might head up to values of 62-65%, obviously possible higher.

It might not pose a threat to Bitcoin now but when it first came out it hurt Bitcoin a lot, at one point it looked like we might even get a flip-flop.  Bitcoin went to around $5k and I think Bitcoin Trash was getting to around $3k.  Bitcoin Cash was being sold around $4.2k at one point.  Like I say it might not pose any threat now but it certainly caused Bitcoin problems and in my opinion it was a situation that should never have happened.

If a shop accepts Bitcoin and you buy a TV for $1000 worth of Bitcoin, VAT is included in the price but if that $1000 worth of Bitcoin was purchased for $500 then you have made $500 of profit.  So you are paying VAT by buying the TV and then you have to pay tax on the $500 profit as well, seems like it would be paying tax twice, VAT and capital gains tax?

**Down But Not Out: Bitcoin Remains on Hunt for $10K**
Bitcoin (BTC) is reporting losses today, having failed to beat the key moving average resistance on Monday, however, the technical charts continue to favor a rally to $10,000.
Bitcoin ran into bids in early European hours yesterday, rising to a four-day high of $9,885, adding credence to Sunday's bullish "outside day" candle. Further, BTC also witnessed a bull flag breakout (a bullish continuation pattern) on the hourly chart.

**Bitcoin Brushes $11K as Bull Case Strengthens**
-A rebound from the 50-hour MA and a break above $11,065 (intra-day high) could yield a rally to the 10-week MA of $11,366. A violation there would expose the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance and the trendline resistance seen today around $11,675 and $11,825, respectively.
-A close today below the downward sloping 50-day MA of $10,512 would allow a re-test of the Feb. 25 low of $9,280.
-Meanwhile, a break below $9,280.4 would signal the corrective rally from the Feb. 6 lows below $6,000 has ended and would open up downside towards the $6,000 mark.

**You are incorrect so please check your facts first before making these posts.**
The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 Economies, also resisted calls from some G20 members to regulate cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.
Interest in cryptocurrencies surged last year as prices rocketed only to tumble in recent months, triggering warnings from regulators.
But in a sign of too little consensus for radical action, the FSB said more international coordination was needed to plug data gaps in monitoring the rapidly evolving but still tiny sector worth less than 1 percent of global GDP at its peak.
“The FSB’s initial assessment is that crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time,” FSB Chair Mark Carney said in a letter to G20 central bankers and finance ministers who will meet in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday.
Carney, who stands down next year when his term as governor of the Bank of England ends, signaled that whoever succeeds him would be overseeing a more open watchdog focused on reviewing rules instead of pushing through new standards.
“As its work to fix the fault lines that caused the financial crisis draws to a close, the FSB is increasingly pivoting away from design of new policy initiatives towards dynamic implementation and rigorous evaluation of the effects of the agreed G20 reforms,” Carney said.

**LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - FSB (Financial Stability Board, FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the countries of the G20 , on Sunday rejected calls from several countries who called for regulation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.**
The FSB, however, stressed the need for greater international coordination in monitoring these rapidly evolving technologies, which still represent a tiny sector equivalent to less than 1% of global gross domestic product.
"The first assessment of the FSB is that currently, these crypto-assets do not pose a risk to global financial stability," said Mark Carney , president of the FSB, in a letter to finance ministers and governors of central banks, which will meet in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday.
Mark Carney, who will leave his post next year, when he resigns as Governor of the Bank of England, noted that his successor would oversee a regulator more inclined to review existing rules than to set up new ones.
In his letter, he also said that the FSB, which has conducted a series of banking and financial reforms after the 2007-2009 crisis, will focus on the current rules rather than design new ones.
"As the work of the FSB, which aims to fill the fault lines that caused the financial crisis, is nearing its end, the latter will focus more (..) on the implementation and rigorous evaluation of the effects. reforms approved by the G20, "said Mark Carney.

How is Chinese New Year celebrated?
The global celebrations are an explosion of light and sound, involving bell ringing, lighting firecrackers and watching traditional lion dances.
Chinese families gather together for a reunion dinner on New Year's Eve, and clean their houses to sweep away bad fortune on New Year's Day.
Traditionally, kids would be given red envelopes stuffed with 'lucky money' and positive wishes on New Year's Day.
Some teens now have red envelope apps, so their relatives can transfer cash digitally.
Which animal represents 2018?
2018 will be the Year of the Dog.
The Chinese zodiac moves in a 12-year cycle, and those born in 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006, and 2018 are also known as Dogs.
According to the Asian astrology, your year of birth - and the animal this represents - determines a lot about your personality traits.
Although each of the twelve animals gets an outing every dozen years, there are different varieties - and 2018 will be the first Year of the Earth Dog since 1958.
Anyone born in an Earth Dog year will be communicative, serious, and responsible in the workplace.
Which Chinese zodiac animal am I?
The Chinese animal zodiac or shengxiao, which means 'born resembling', are arranged in a repeating cycle of 12 years.
The animal changes at the beginning of the Chinese New Year, and traditionally these animals were used to date the years.
However, Chinese New Year is a movable celebration, dictated by the lunar cycle, which can fall anytime between January 21 and February 20.
This year, for example, it will be celebrated on Friday, 16th February.

One positive for today, Omkar Godbole from coindesk dot com says that Bitcoin is headed for $8k, over the last 3 months he has been wrong atleast 80% of the time.  God knows how he gets paid for the shit he writes.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:18:40
11k means very little in the big picture, hopefully we can zoom past it over the next few days/weeks.

I know anything can happen, it's possible we get over the ATH in the next few days.  
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:46:58
No bad news that we know of.  Everything other then the price is very positive at the moment.

Nice reply and we need more people like you on here.  When I first joined there seemed to be far more reasoned debate.  Now all we seem to get are the people that are getting a lot of pleasure out of seeing Bitcoin take a dive.

European Commission - Speech - [Check Against Delivery]
Remarks by Vice-President Dombrovskis at the Roundtable on Cryptocurrencies
Brussels, 26 February 2018
Good afternoon, 
I would like to debrief you on a roundtable discussion with key authorities, industry representatives and experts who shared their insights and views on cryptocurrencies.
The aim of this roundtable was first and foremost to feed into our upcoming Action Plan on FinTech, and the EU's position for a possible discussion at G20 level. As you know, there is already a joint Franco – German letter on this point.
Crypto-asset markets are global, with worldwide transactions between investors, consumers and intermediaries.
On its own, Europe represents only a small share of global cryptocurrency trading, so we need to work together with our partners in the G20 and international standard-setters.
Today's roundtable focused on three main topics:
the implications of crypto-currencies for financial markets,
the risks and the opportunities associated with their use,
and the recent development of Initial Coin Offerings.
We concluded that:
First, the blockchain technology holds strong promise for financial markets. To remain competitive, Europe must embrace this innovation.
Second, crypto-currencies, which are not currencies in the traditional sense, and whose value is not guaranteed, have become subject of considerable speculation.
This exposes consumers and investors to substantial risk including the risk to lose their investment.
This is why our third conclusion is that warnings about these risks to consumers and investors are important: these must be clear, frequent, and across all jurisdictions.
Fourth, Initial Coin Offerings have become a way for innovative firms in this field to raise substantial amounts of funding.
This is an opportunity, but there are also problems that expose investors to substantial risk, such as the lack of transparency regarding the identity of the issuers and underlying business plans.
Fifth, we need to assess further under what circumstances crypto-currencies and related services are covered by existing regulation.
This depends very much on the facts and circumstances around specific crypto-tokens.
Based on the assessment of risks and opportunities and the suitability of the existing regulatory framework for these instruments, the Commission will determine if regulatory action at EU level is required.
Finally, crypto-assets present risks relating to money laundering and the financing of illicit activities.
That is why the Commission proposed that virtual currency exchanges and wallet providers should be subject to the Anti-Money Laundering Directive.
The co-legislators reached an agreement in December, and we invite Member States to prepare for a speedy transposition of this legislation.
To sum up, the Commission will continue to monitor these markets together with other stakeholders, at EU and international level, including in the G20.
We stand ready to take action based on an assessment of risks and opportunities.
Following upcoming international discussions, we will decide on how to follow up today's roundtable.
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:57:08
Hopefully never see you post again :)
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:16:15
How was it 85% in one week? 
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:13:04
That was when there was a massive backlog of transactions, it's very cheap now and there is no backlog.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:10:29
There will always be manipulation in any market. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:02:18
I thought I would have to wait more then 1 min to hear that again! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:54:35
Have we reached the bottom do you think?

How many Star Wars helmets have you got?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:17:54
A bit premature to say Bitcoin has rebounded.  The way things are going I won't believe in a rebound unless we see it moving up and staying up for atleast a few days, not 5 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:07:01
This 100%

It's like saying you won't go on the internet at all because some sick people have images of kids on the internet.  Not trying to be rude but I wish people would engage their brains.  You really think they are going to put everyone on the sex offenders register that uses the blockchain! Seriously!

@_date: 2018-02-21 21:53:39
Agreed, there is a lot of buying power in Asia. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:43:07
Yep, they certainly like that one.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:58:10
The next few hours will be interesting with New York waking up.  
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:58:19
So you think it's now going to go up again?
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:30:18
It can go up just as fast.  I have seen it go up $1k or more in literally less then 5 mins. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:19:33
I've never been into facebook, it's my idea of hell.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:22:09
I would guess that the number of people with Bitcoin is less then 350 million but that is good as there is so much more room for growth. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:26:40
Most of it utter drivel as well.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:03:39
Is this Wall Street making their BIG play? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:08:52

Come On New York!

Don't be nasty!  Plenty of people lose money trying to trade. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:49:24
Why is this too fast?  
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:44:11
The small time buyers have very little influence on price imo
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:46:33
I think you could very well be right.  Bitcoin's dominance rising is a very good thing and a lot of these altcoins need to sink. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:19:50
Don't worry, your English is very good. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:40:33
Why have you not kept any at all? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:32:14
First rule of understanding the market: You will never understand the market. There are way too many people and moving parts involved.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:35:24
Amazing how many jealous and bitter people there are when it comes to money.
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:54:16
It didn't help at all but it would be stretching it a lot to blame them entirely. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:55:26
The vast majority in this market are in it for money reasons. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:59:29

@_date: 2018-02-22 10:25:06
Lets have a good day folks, think positive!  We can get back to where we were over the next few days, lets start with Europe getting us back to around $10.5k 
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:58:37
Nice post. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:59:48

**Bitcoin Price Retakes 50-Day Moving Average in First Since May**
Bitcoin (BTC) scaled the crucial 50-day moving average (MA) on Monday for the first time in nearly two months, taking its price above $6,700.
The corrective rally picked up the pace 24 hours ago, possibly due to reports stating that BlackRock, INC – the world's largest asset manager and exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider – is considering venturing into cryptocurrency markets. Later in the day, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink clarified rumors by stating that he doesn't see a huge demand for cryptocurrencies from clients,
Still, BTC remained bid and closed (as per UTC) above the 20-day MA for the first time since May 20, validating the argument that a short-term bottom has been made at $5,755 (June 24 low).
While a move above the 50-day MA is encouraging, it does not qualify as a bullish reversal.  Only a convincing break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline of $6,838 would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.
At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,720 on Bitfinex – up 5 percent in the last 24 hours – and the 50-day MA is located at $6,720.
BTC looks set to test $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline), albeit after a minor pullback as the cryptocurrency is looking overbought as per intraday technical studies.
A close (as per UTC) above $6,838 would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and would open up upside towards $7,920 (target as per the measured height method). That said, bulls would still need to observe caution as the area between $7,000-$7,100 is packed with stiff resistance lines.
On the downside, a close below 20-day MA of $6,448 would weaken the odds of an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.

**Bitcoin Price Indicator May Signal Next Leg Higher**
History looks to be repeating itself in the bitcoin market, as a key indicator’s bullish turn could mark the beginning of the next meteoric price rally.
The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency’s price action seen over the last eight months is very similar to the moves seen in 2015, according to Bitstamp data. For instance, the bitcoin bear market ended near $3,100 in mid-December 2018 and prices built a base below $4,000 in the following three months before breaking into a bull market on April 2.
Notably, the bear market drop ran out of steam two months before the 50- and 10-week moving averages confirmed a bearish crossover (in February 2019).
Further, the new bull market began two months following the confirmation of the bearish crossover. That is hardly surprising as bearish crossovers of long duration MAs are big-time lagging indicators and often mark bear market bottoms.
What’s more interesting is that the previous bear market (2014) had also run out of steam in the run-up to the bearish crossover and the confirmation of the crossover was followed by a bullish breakout.
The bear market, which began at the end of 2013, ran out of steam at lows near $150 in January 2015. The 50- and 100-week MAs produced a bearish cross in April and a bullish reversal was confirmed at the end of October 2015.
Note that the bull market had stalled around $450 following a quick rise from $320 to $500 in November.
The cryptocurrency resumed the bull market in the last week of May 2016 after prices rose 18 percent and the 50- and 100-week MAs produced a bullish crossover.
More importantly, BTC went on to hit fresh record highs above $1,200 in February 2017.
As of now, BTC is trading around $10,300, having rallied from $4,000 to $13,880 in the second quarter. Essentially, the bull market has stalled in the last few weeks.
With history repeating itself, there is a strong reason to believe that the bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-week MAs, if and when, confirmed, could mark the beginning of a meteoric rise well above $20,000.
Currently, the 50- and 100-week MAs are located at $6,556 and $7,668, respectively.

**Van Eck, SolidX to Offer Bitcoin ETF to Institutions via SEC Exemption: Report**
While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far blocked a number of proposed bitcoin ETFs, two firms aim to launch a more limited option this week.
According to a [report]( by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, VanEck Securities and SolidX Management – which have previously had a decision on their proposed bitcoin ETF postponed by the SEC – are taking an unusual route to bypass the regulatory hurdles. They will use an SEC exemption that will allow shares in their VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust to be offered to institutions such as hedge funds and banks, but not to retail investors.
The shares are reportedly planned to be sold from Thursday under the SEC’s [Rule 144A]( which allows privately placed securities to be traded among “qualified institutional buyers” with shorter holding periods and without the requirement to register with the SEC.
To date, the SEC has not approved any crypto ETF, although SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson [said]( in 2019 that he believes an ETF proposal will “eventually” meet the SEC’s standards.
On Aug. 12, the SEC [delayed decisions]( on bitcoin ETF proposals by Bitwise Asset Management, VanEck/SolidX and Wilshire Phoenix, all of which hope to become the first to offer a crypto ETF in the U.S. Those decisions are now scheduled for later this month and in October.

**Bitcoin Price Prepares to Test $8K After Bull Breather**
Bitcoin's (BTC) minor price pullback yesterday has likely recharged the bulls for a rally towards $8,000, technical charts indicate.
The leading cryptocurrency has spent a better part of the last 15 hours trading in the $7,240–$7,440 range, having clocked a 40-day high of $7,588 at 18:00 UTC yesterday.
Moreover, BTC was looking overbought at multi-week highs, hence a minor correction was expected.
More importantly, the price pullback and the subsequent consolidation, when viewed against the backdrop of the high volume inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, indicate that BTC has likely gathered steam for a more sustainable rally towards $8,000.
At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,400 on Bitfinex – up 0.2 percent on a 24-hour basis.
Bitcoin's price pullback last night has likely recharged the engines for a rally to $8,000 and the psychological resistance could be put to test in the next 48 hours.
The short-term outlook remains bullish as long as BTC is trading above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline of $6,838.
A deeper technical correction, if it occurs, could be short-lived as the daily chart and the hourly chart are biased towards the bulls.

**Bull Return? Bitcoin Eyes $11K After Upside Break**
-Bitcoin looks set to test $11,000 today and could extend gains to $11,385 (weekly 10-MA). A violation there would shift attention to key resistance levels: the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline and the descending trendline.
-A daily close above the descending trendline would allow for a stronger rally to $17,400 (inverse head and shoulders breakout target as per the measured height method).
-Bearish scenario: Rejection at the weekly 10-MA, followed by a quick drop below $9,280 (Feb. 25 low) would add credence to the bearish weekly RSI and trigger a sell-off to $8,000-$7,800.

**History Favors the Bulls as Bitcoin Trades Sideways at $10K**
[ 
 
 View
* Bitcoin’s long-term bullish bias remains intact, with prices holding well above the historically strong support of the three-day chart’s 55-candle exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $8,972. The line served as a strong base in the 2016–2017 bull market.
* A bullish falling-wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart looks likely and could pave the way for a retest of recent highs above $10,900.
* The prospects of a breakout would weaken if prices find acceptance below Wednesday’s low of $9,855 on the back of a rise in selling volumes. That would expose support at $9,320 (Aug. 29 low).
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rally has stalled in the last 10 weeks, but the bullish case remains intact with prices hovering well above a historically strong price support.
The leading cryptocurrency broke into the latest bull market on April 2 with a high-volume rise from $4,000 to $5,000. It subsequently went on to hit a 17-month high of $13,880 on Bitstamp on June 26.
Since then, however, the cryptocurrency has charted a narrowing price range with lower highs above $12,000 and higher lows below $10,000.
The consolidation is reminiscent of a contracting triangle near $6,000 seen in the August to October period last year. That narrowing price range had ended with a downside break in November.
The latest consolidation, therefore, may force investors to question the validity of the bullish breakout confirmed in April.
However, it is too early to call an end of the bull market and the risks will remain skewed to the upside as long as the cryptocurrency is defending the three-day chart’s 55-candle exponential moving average.
That EMA line served as a strong base during the 2016–2017 bull run. As of writing, the EMA is located at $8,972, while at press time BTC is changing hands at $10,145 on Bitstamp, representing a nearly 1 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.
At the end of October 2015, bitcoin’s outlook turned bullish with prices rising above $300. The cryptocurrency then formed a series of higher lows and higher highs to hit a record high of $20,000 in December 2017.
Notably, the higher lows (marked by arrows) were established along the ascending (bullish) 55-candle EMA and almost every bounce ended up setting a higher high.
For instance, bitcoin’s pullback from the June 2016 high above $770 ran out of steam below the 55-candle EMA at $542 in August 2016 following which prices rallied to $1,100 by January 2017.
On similar lines, pullbacks to the 55-candle EMA in April 2016 and March, July, and September 2017 fueled stronger rallies. Not once were sellers strong enough to force a convincing close below the 55-candle EMA.
Hence, the bullish case put forward by 2019’s second-quarter price rise is likely to weaken only if and when the three-candle finds acceptance under the 55-candle EMA, currently at $8,972.
In fact, any pullback to the crucial average will be the biggest test for the bulls. A strong bounce from that level will likely cement expectations of a rally to fresh record highs above $20,000.
As for the next 24 hours, the odds appear stacked in favor of a move higher for BTC.
BTC is trapped in a falling-wedge pattern, a bullish continuation setup, [as discussed]( yesterday. Trading volumes have dropped throughout the pullback from $10,949 to $9,855 (Tuesday’s low).
So, the probability of BTC witnessing a wedge breakout is high – more so, as the widely-tracking trend-following moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bullish reversal.
The Chaikin money flow index, which incorporates both prices and trading volumes, is also reporting a bullish divergence – higher lows contradicting lower lows on price.
A wedge breakout, if confirmed, would open the doors for a retest of recent highs above $10,900.
The bullish case would weaken if prices drop below Wednesday’s low of $9,855 with a solid rise in selling volumes.

***Updated article:*** **VanEck, SolidX to Offer Bitcoin ETF-Like Product to Institutions**
***Update*** *(13:15 UTC, Sept. 3 2019): Added details and comment from a press release sent after publication of this article. Further, we’ve clarified that the product is not a true ETF, although similar.*
While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far blocked a number of proposed bitcoin ETFs, two firms aim to launch a more limited option this week.
Announced Tuesday, VanEck Securities and SolidX Management – which have previously had a decision on their proposed bitcoin ETF postponed by the SEC – revealed they are taking an unusual route to bypass the regulatory hurdles. The companies will use an SEC exemption that will allow shares in their VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust to be offered to institutions such as hedge funds and banks, but not to retail investors.
Though not in fact a true exchange-traded fund, the product is similar. Ed Lopez, head of ETF product at VanEck, told CoinDesk that the offering “allows for shares to be created and redeemed like ETFs, but it is not an ETF.”
“Unlike an ETF it isn’t listed on a national exchange, rather it is quoted on the OTC Link ATS platform. This is a first-of-its-kind type of offering. Given it will trade over-the-counter via broker-to-broker transactions, we’ve been casually referring to it as a Broker Traded Fund, a BTF,” Lopez said.
The shares are to be sold from Thursday under the SEC’s [Rule 144A]( which allows privately placed securities to be traded among “qualified institutional buyers” with shorter holding periods and without the requirement to register with the SEC.
“The shares will provide institutional investors access to a physically-backed bitcoin product that is tradeable through traditional and prime brokerage accounts,” the firms explained in a press release. “The Shares are the first institutional-quality, cleared product providing exposure to bitcoin and enabling a standard ETF creation-and-redemption process.”
Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategies at VanEck/MVIS, said;


SolidX is sponsoring the trust, while VanEck is providing “marketing services,” according to the release. Further, BNY Mellon has come onboard as the daily fund accountant, administrator and transfer agent. This includes “facilitating the investor creation and redemption activity.”
Investors are also insured against “the theft or loss” of the bitcoin private keys held by the trust, and are provided open-ended creation and redemption of shares, the firms said.
Daniel H. Gallancy, CEO of SolidX, commented:


To date, the SEC has not approved any crypto ETF, although SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson [said]( in 2019 that he believes an ETF proposal will “eventually” meet the SEC’s standards.
On Aug. 12, the SEC [delayed decisions]( on bitcoin ETF proposals by Bitwise Asset Management, VanEck/SolidX and Wilshire Phoenix, all of which hope to become the first to offer a crypto ETF in the U.S. Those decisions are now scheduled for later this month and in October.

**Bitcoin Eyes Move to $10,950 Hurdle After Price Breakout**
[ 
 
 View
* The 4-hour chart is reporting a bullish breakout. As a result, bitcoin could challenge key resistance at $10,956 in the next few days.
* Daily chart indicators also indicate scope for a retest of recent highs.
* A UTC close above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high) would activate twin bullish cues and open the door to $12,000.
* A high-volume break below Wednesday’s low of $9,855 would revive the bearish view, although, that looks unlikely.
Bitcoin has regained poise in the last 48 hours and could revisit recent highs in the next couple of days, charts suggest.
The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization picked up a bid at lows below $9,900 on Wednesday and rose past $10,100 yesterday, confirming a falling-wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart.
The falling wedge pattern, comprising of converging trendlines connecting lower highs and lower lows, [was created]( during the pullback from last Friday’s high near $10,956 (bearish lower high of Aug. 20) to Wednesday’s low of $9,855.
The low-volume correction, however, ended with a bullish breakout on Thursday and the cryptocurrency is now looking north, and a re-test of the bearish lower high of $10,956 could be in the offing in the next couple of days.
As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,320 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $10,458 earlier today.
 
The falling-wedge breakout is backed by an above-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI). The indicator has also breached the falling trendline.
Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is printing bars above the zero line, indicating bullish conditions. Meanwhile, the Chaikin money flow (CMF), which takes into account both prices and trading volumes, is also holding above zero – a sign of strengthening buying pressure.
As a result, further gains to levels above $10,900 look likely.
 
BTC created a long-tailed candle on Wednesday, indicating seller exhaustion below $10,000. Similar daily candles (marked with arrows) have consistently marked temporary bottoms and fueled minor price rallies over the last 10 weeks.
Hence, there is a strong case for a rise to the bearish lower high of $10,956.
BTC also appears to be forming the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern with the neckline resistance near $10,956.
So, a UTC close above that level would activate twin bullish cues: invalidation of bearish lower highs and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.
The latter would create the room rise to $12,590 (target as per the measured move method).
On the downside, $9,855 (Wednesday’s low) is the level to beat for sellers, although that looks unlikely at press time.

**Bitcoin Price Hits Two-Month High as Dominance Rate Spikes**
Bitcoin (BTC) price clocked a two-month high of $7,820 on Bifinex today and looks set to extend gains further, a key cryptomarket gauge indicates.
CoinMarketCap's bitcoin dominance rate, an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency, rose to 46 percent today — the highest level since December 20, adding credence to BTC's 20 percent rally seen in the last seven days.
To start with, a rise in the BTC dominance rate essentially means the premiere cryptocurrency is more in demand compared to the alternative cryptocurrencies.
A spike in the BTC dominance rate validates the short-term bullish outlook.
A convincing break above the 100-day MA of $7,610 would only bolster the already bullish technical setup and could yield a test of 200-day MA of $8,720.
A break below $7,190 (broadening wedge floor) would invalidate the bullish view.

**Bitcoin’s Record Hash Rate May Hint at Price Gains to Come**
[ 
 
 View
* With the hash rate or miner’s confidence hitting record highs, bitcoin’s three-day narrowing price range looks set to end with a bullish breakout.
* A range breakout would open the doors to $10,956 – the bearish [lower high]( created on Aug. 20.
* A break below Friday’s low of $10,154 would confirm a range breakdown and could yield a sell-off to $9,855 (Sept. 11 low).
Bitcoin’s latest bout of consolidation may end up with bullish breakout, as a key metric of miner confidence has hit all-time highs.
The top cryptocurrency by market value has clocked lower daily highs and higher daily lows over the last three days and is currently trading at $10,300 on Bitstamp, little changed on a 24-hour basis.
The cryptocurrency has charted the narrowing price range amid a surge in non-price metrics including a rise in the network’s hash rate – a measure of the computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin.
Notably, the two-week average hash rate [reached]( a record high of 85 exahashes per second (EH/s) around 19:00 UTC on Friday. Further, mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to create a block of transactions – also jumped to a new all-time high of nearly 12 trillion.
Hash rate can be considered a barometer of miners’ confidence in the bitcoin price rally. After all, they are more likely to dedicate more resources to the computer intensive process that secures the network and processes transactions if they are bullish on price. Miners would likely scale back operations if a price slide is expected.
Hence, many observers, including the likes of [Changpeng Zhao]( CEO of Binance, and former Wall Street trader and journalist [Max Keiser]( believe prices follow hash rate.
Zhao [tweeted]( on Friday that, a rising hash rate means “more miners are investing in BTC,” while few other observers stated that sellers should think twice before betting against the most secure blockchain (the higher the hash rate of a cryptocurrency network, the more expensive it is to attack).
It is worth noting, though, that the market is divided on the relationship between price and hash rate.
Some observers [believe]( the hash rate follows price and the metric’s stellar performance represents overtly exuberant miners.
That said, the price is likely to follow the hash rate this time, as over-exuberance is typically observed at market tops or near record highs. As of now, BTC is down almost $10,000 from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017.
Further, with the next [reward halving]( (supply cut) due in less than a year, market sentiment is quite bullish. The sustained uptick in miners’ confidence is more likely to draw fresh bids, possibly leading to a positive feedback loop.
Bitcoin has charted (above left) back-to-back inside bar candlestick pattern on the daily chart over the last three days. The first inside bar appeared on Friday as that day’s high and low fell within Thursday’s trading range. The second and the third inside bar candle was created on Saturday and Sunday, respectively.
Inside bars indicate consolidation and lack of volatility, often ending with an explosive move on either side. A break below the first inside bar’s (Friday) low of $10,154 would imply range breakdown and could yield a stronger sell-off to levels below $9,855 (Sept. 11 low).
A break above Friday’s high of $10,458 would imply range breakout and open the doors to $10,956 (July 20 high).
**The falling wedge breakout confirmed on the 4-hour chart (above right) last week is still valid. So, the probability of range breakout is high.**

**Bitcoin Mining Power Hits New High as Half a Million New ASICs Go Online**
[ 
 The computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin has hit yet another new high, suggesting that more than 600,000 powerful new machines may have come online in the last three months.
According to data from crypto mining pool BTC.com, bitcoin’s two-week average hash rate has crossed another major threshold, reaching 85 exahashes per second (EH/s) around 19:00 UTC last Friday. Meanwhile, mining difficulty also adjusted to a new record of nearly 12 trillion.
Notably, both figures have jumped 60 percent since June 14, the data [shows.](
Bitcoin’s mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to create a block of transactions – adjusts after 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks. This is to ensure the time to produce a block remains around 10 minutes, even as the amount of hashing power, deployed by machines around the globe competing to win freshly minted bitcoins, fluctuates.
Several new models of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners hit the market over the summer, with an average hashing power around 55 tera hashes per second (TH/s).
Assuming all of the 35 EH/s of new hashing power added since mid-June came from these top-of-the-line models, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that more than half a million such machines have connected to the bitcoin network. (1 EH/s =1 million TH/s)
 Billion-dollar business?
These powerful ASIC miners, made by major manufacturers such as Bitmain, Canaan, InnoSilicon and MicroBT, are priced from $1,500 to $2,500 each. So if more than half a million of them were delivered, as estimated above, the leading miner makers could have made $1 billion in revenue over the past three months.
Bitcoin’s spiking hash rate and difficulty are in line with the soaring price since earlier this year, which led to increasing demand for mining equipment that has significantly [outstripped]( supply. It’s also in part thanks to the rainy summer season in southwestern China which resulted in cheap, abundant hydroelectric power.
Further, there has also been a growing interest in Russia’s Eastern [Siberia]( region, where the Brastsk hydropower station built in the Cold War era has been utilized to power mining farms that are estimated to account for almost 10 percent of the total computing power on the bitcoin network.
Miners in China estimated earlier this year that bitcoin’s average hash rate in the summer would break the level of 70 EH/s, which [happened]( in August.
As such, major miner manufacturers have already sold out equipment that is due for shipment until the end of the year with customers placing pre-orders three months in advance.
TokenInsight, a startup that focuses on analysis of crypto trading and mining activities, said in a report published Friday that additional supplies of miners are expected to hit the market in the coming months.
“Following the drastic increase in bitcoin’s price, the bitcoin mining market saw significant inflation in Q2 2019. Most of the miners from various manufacturers were in serious shortage and pre-orders submitted in Q2 and Q3 are to be delivered by the end of the year,” the report states.
Therefore, the firm estimates mining difficulty will maintain its growth momentum to reach 15 trillion by the end of the year – with bitcoin’s average total hashing power crossing the threshold of 100 EH/s for the first time in its history.

Fundstrat’s Thomas Lee has lowered his Bitcoin price forecast for this year to $22,000 from $25,000.
In making his case the co-founder and managing partner of Fundstrat argued that the price of Bitcoin should be double that of the flagship cryptocurrency’s mining costs. With the mining cost of Bitcoin currently at US$9,100 according to Lee, doubling this cost while including other variables should see the price of the cryptocurrency reaching US$22,000 before the end of 2018.
Cost of Production
Lee went on to argue that the Bitcoin Price to Mining Breakeven cost (P/BE) cost metric was currently lower than 1 and miners thus needed to boost the price in order to operate profitably. He was speaking during the 2018 Asia Blockchain Summit held in Taipei, Taiwan where he was one of the guests.
Referring to the Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) which he created and unveiled this year, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors said that Bitcoin had already reached a bottom. According to Lee, the BMI’s current reading is less than 30 and this is a bullish signal since the closer the index is to zero the stronger the suggestion for investors to buy.
Per Lee, some of the reasons why the price of Bitcoin is still way below the record high it hit last year include regulatory uncertainty. He also suggested that Bitcoin was being hurt by futures contracts.
Bitcoin’s Harsh Winter
Lee also noted that the bearish sentiment this year was more severe than the one of 2014. Four years ago it took around 300 days for the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap to fall by over 70%. This year, however, a similar drop occurred in a period of 200 days.
Lee first predicted that Bitcoin would hit a price of US$25,000 by year-end earlier this year in April.
“We still feel pretty confident bitcoin is a great risk/reward, and we think it can reach $25,000 by the end of the year,” CCN reported Lee as having said in a television interview.
Only time will tell if Lee’s latest Bitcoin price prediction will come true. During this year’s Consensus conference, which was held two months ago in New York, Fundstrat’s managing partner had predicted that there would be a rally in the cryptocurrency markets. However, the price of Bitcoin actually fell while the total cryptocurrency market value dipped by more than $40 billion during the event.
Despite the disappointment, Lee still stuck by his forecast of Bitcoin reaching US$25,000 by year-end. Until now.

**Bitcoin Again Shows Green Shoots After $6K Defense**
Bitcoin's (BTC) sharp recovery from two-week lows has raised the odds of a stronger rally towards $6,400, technical studies indicate.
As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,245 on Bitfinex.
BTC was expected to drop below $6,000 in the last 24 hours as the bears were on the offensive following an inverted flag breakdown.
However, the intraday oversold conditions likely put a floor under bitcoin prices at the two-week low of $6,080, helping it chart a solid rebound to $6,283 (today's high).
While it is too early to call a bullish reversal, the change of fortune has saved the day for the BTC bulls. Moreover, the probability of BTC's price charting a picture-perfect inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern would have dropped sharply had BTC found acceptance below $6,000.
Further, the sharp recovery from $6,080 to $6,283 has opened the doors to re-test of $6,400, the price chart analysis indicates.
BTC could attack the $6,400 mark, but further gains are ruled out for now as the descending (bearish) 5-day MA and 10-day MA are located at $6,366 and $6,500, respectively.
That said, if BTC manages to close (as per UTC) today above 10-day MA, then the doors would open for a re-test of the Monday's high of $6,820.
Bearish scenario: A failure to produce a significant move higher despite the bullish price RSI divergence and the falling wedge breakout would shift risk in favor of a drop to a recent low of $5,755. The downside move will likely gather pace if BTC fails to hold above $6,080 (previous day's high) over the weekend.

**Will Bitcoin’s Price Rally After Federal Reserve Rate Cut?**
[ 
 
 View
* Bitcoin has dived out of a narrowing price range and may see a deeper drop if key trendline support near $10,120 is breached.
* Acceptance below $10,120 would expose the recent low of $9,855.
* Some notable observers believe the decline may be reversed following Wednesday’s Federal Reserve rate cut, although historical data suggests otherwise.
* On the higher side, $10,956 (Aug. 20 high) remains the level to beat for the bulls.
Bitcoin is down again, but some observers believe the losses could be reversed after a U.S. interest rate cut expected Wednesday.
The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell to lows below $10,100 yesterday, marking a downside break of the narrowing price range created near $10,300 in the three days to Sept. 15.
As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,150 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.4 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.
So, the bears have gained an upper hand in the last 24 hours despite [record high]( miner confidence, and a deeper drop may unfold in the next 24 hours.
The decline, however, could end up trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market, according to some observers, who expect BTC to benefit from an impending 25 basis point U.S. rate cut on Wednesday.
For instance, [Nigel Green]( founder and CEO of a global financial advisory giant deVere Group, [believes]( the cryptocurrency will pick up a strong bid in response to the Federal Reserve’s rate cut, as the reduction in borrowing costs will lower the yield (return) on the U.S. dollar.
Meanwhile, [Anthony Pompliano]( founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Assets, [tweeted]( in August that BTC could fly high if the Fed rate cuts are followed by a government buying program (quantitative easing).
Former Wall Street Journal trader and journalist [Max Keiser]( also believes the Fed’s continued monetary easing would send bitcoin to $100,000. 
Rate cuts are inflationary in nature, meaning they reduce the purchasing power of fiat currencies.
Hence, there is a general consensus in the crypto market that Federal Reserve’s monetary easing will bode well for bitcoin, which is deflationary in nature and is set to undergo a mining reward halving (supply cut) in less than a year.
Bitcoin, however, has seldom taken cues from the Fed’s actions in the past. For instance, the Fed hiked rates by 25 basis points in December 2015. That was the first hike since 2006. The central bank delivered another rate hike in December 2016 and hiked rates four times in 2017.
Even so, BTC broke into a bull market with a convincing move above $300 at the end of October 2015 and went on to hit a record high of $20,000 by December 2017.
As such, the probability of BTC responding positively to tomorrow’s rate cut is debatable.
Also, traditional markets [have priced in]( a 25 basis point rate cut and the FX markets will likely dump the U.S. dollar only if the Fed cuts rates by 50 basis points or signals aggressive easing over the near term. In that case, the anti-dollar sentiment may feed into the crypto markets.
Bitcoin fell to $10,060 on Monday, signaling a downside break of the narrowing price range of the back-to-back inside bar candlesticks, [as discussed]( yesterday.
As of now, prices are sitting on the ascending trendline support at $10,120. A break lower would further strengthen the bear grip and allow a deeper drop to $9,855.
On the higher side, the bearish lower high of $10,956 created on Aug. 20 remains the level to beat for the bulls.
That level could come into play if the rising trendline support fuels a price bounce above $10,458 (Friday’s high).
The probability of a downside break is high as last week’s falling wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart (above right) failed to draw bids. In fact, the breakout ended up creating another bearish lower high at $10,458.

**Bitcoin Retains Bull Bias Despite Price Drop to Below $8K**
Bitcoin's (BTC) drop below $8,000 yesterday may have tempered the positive mood in the market, but the broader outlook still remains bullish, technical charts indicate.
The overnight drop in price came soon after the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) second rejection of the Winklevoss brothers' application for a bitcoin ETF.
While the decision may have soured the sentiment in the market, the price pullback was also likely a function of overbought conditions. Notably, the short-duration price chart had warned of a dip below $8,000 yesterday.
At press time, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $7,965 on Bitfinex, having clocked a three-day low of $7,848 earlier today.
It is worth noting that BTC is still up 40 percent from the June 24 low of $5,755, despite the pullback from the two-month highs above $8,500. Thus, it is safe to say the bull market is intact.
The short-term outlook remains bullish, despite the overnight correction in BTC prices.
The 200-day moving average hurdle of $8,557 could be put to test over the weekend if prices find acceptance above $8,000 in the next 24 hours.
On the downside, only a daily close below the rising 10-day MA of $7,718 would abort the short-term bullish view.

**100 Merchants Can Now Trial Bitcoin's Lightning Network Risk Free**
A few lucky merchants now have one less obstacle to accepting bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network.
Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, payment processing startup CoinGate is opening up a pilot program that will allow 100 merchants to trial a Lightning-enabled version of its service, one which taps into the open-source tech meant to make bitcoin transactions fast and cheap.
As with CoinGate's standard service, the company will handle the finer details of crypto-to-fiat exchange, however, the new pilot has the benefit of covering the costs should funds be lost due to the early-stage nature of the software (lightning implementations are now largely in beta).
And while most experts believe the network still isn't ready to support significant commercial transactions, CoinGate CTO Rytis Bieliauskas thinks there's a greater good that will be achieved in being among the first to test the waters.
He told CoinDesk:
"It's a very new technology. Inevitably there will be some bugs, either in our implementation or in the Lightning Network. It will help, not just us, but the whole community because the bugs we find might help the whole protocol."
Although Lightning invoices are typically limited by the protocol itself to 0.042 bitcoin each, or under $300 according to current prices, CoinGate CCO Vilius Semenas told CoinDesk there's no established limit to how many invoices CoinGate will reimburse if funds are lost.
At least for the time being, few shoppers have the resources to send cryptocurrency from a Lightning wallet such as Zap. But this pilot could test whether Lightning actually tackles some of the issues that deter mainstream merchants from prioritizing crypto payments in the first place.
For example, bitcoin's latency presents an issue for CoinGate clients like the Romania-based adult content platform LiveJasmin.
"Instant payments are the most important from our point of view," Tamás Szerencse, head of payments at LiveJasmin, said, expanding on why the company joined CoinGate's Lightning pilot.
With up to 40 million daily visitors, LiveJasmin could become one of the biggest mainstream merchants to experiment with Lightning so far. Experimenting with more diverse transaction types could provide invaluable insight into how Lightning works out in the wild.
Learning from experiments
As such, CoinGate is emerging as one of a small, but growing number of crypto payment processors to take the leap. (Last week GloBee helped crypto hardware wallet accessory provider CryptoCloaks accept its first payment.)
Still, most acknowledge there's still a long way to go until mainstream merchants could safely use Lightning.
Steve Beauregard, the founder of the payment processor GoCoin, told CoinDesk he agreed with Bieliauskas that layered networks might be able to reduce friction for recurring payments, but he acknowledged the tech is still in its infancy, which is likely to limit shoppers.
"It's still very complicated for an average end-user to use it [Lightning]," Beauregard said. "I think the ones that benefit the most would be international merchants that are trying to accept payments from overseas."
The majority of merchants who applied for this pilot were businesses like collectibles maker Bitgild, which offers silver and gold coins engraved with QR codes for real cryptocurrency, catering to clients who are already fascinated by Lightning experiments.
Beyond cross-border payments, Bieliauskas argued Lightning-enabled transactions could soon provide a cheaper option than credit cards for merchants dealing with micropayments or payments worth a fraction of a penny.
For now, Beauregard said the primary value such Lightning pilots offer is an opportunity to participate in experimental research.
Speaking to that point, renowned Lightning developer Alex Bosworth agreed this pilot will provide a learn opportunity for the whole network. Lightning's most useful features for merchants are still in development.

**PwC Luxembourg to Start Accepting Bitcoin from October 2019: Official** 
[ 
 PwC Luxembourg, a subsidiary of the world’s second-largest professional services firm, will start accepting Bitcoin ([BTC]( payments from Oct. 1.
 “Bitcoin cannot be compromised”
The Luxembourg branch of the “Big Four” auditing firm [announced]( the initiative in a news release on Sept. 2, claiming the move shows its commitment to comply with the needs of clients as well as support the growing national crypto ecosystem.
In the announcement, PwC Luxembourg expressed confidence in Bitcoin, calling it the “first peer-to-peer payment mechanism that cannot be compromised and is based on a decentralised trust model.”
Partners yet to be unveiled
The company said it is aware of the existing shortcomings of cryptocurrencies and the challenges associated with its adoption. PwC Luxembourg added that it has partnered with an unnamed, regulated local exchange in order to provide the best experience. It wrote:


PwC Luxembourg’s move to accept crypto payments stems from the positive stance to the industry by its parent company, PwC. In June, PwC [announced]( the release of Halo, a crypto auditing software solution enabling the firm to provide independent evidence of private-public key pairing and collect data about transactions and balances from blockchains.
Earlier this year, Cointelegraph [reported]( that PwC is the biggest recruiter for blockchain-related jobs on recruitment platform Indeed. In a recent news release, PwC said that it has more than 400 staff working on blockchain and crypto initiatives supported by more than 100 technical team members.

**Billionaire Marc Lasry sees bitcoin reaching up to $40,000 as it becomes more mainstream and easier to trade**
The price of bitcoin could reach up to $40,000 as it becomes more mainstream and easier to trade, billionaire investor Marc Lasry told CNBC on Wednesday.
"As it gets more into the mainstream, and as more markets end up allowing it to trade where it's freely tradable, to me that's more of the bet," Lasry said in a "Squawk Box" interview, adding he sees bitcoin investors making 5 to 10 times their money in 3 to 5 years.
Lasry's day job is running the distressed debt investment firm that he helped start, Avenue Capital Group, which has about $9.6 billion in assets under management. But he said his bitcoin investments were made with his personal money.
In December, Lasry expressed regret about not buying bitcoin sooner, saying he should've bought the cryptocurrency when it was at $300 just a couple of years ago.
Bitcoin was trading up 1.35 percent early Wednesday at more than $7,400, according to CoinDesk.
Bitcoin has struggled to regain footing after nearing $20,000 at the end of last year. The cryptocurrency has lost more than half its value in the first half of this year, according to data from Coinbase. However, the price of bitcoin spiked Tuesday, with pundits saying the price jump had more to do with technical levels than any other catalyst.
Lasry expects bitcoin will have the most benefit for investors out of all the cryptocurrencies, saying "the reason why I like bitcoin is because it's the one everybody is going to come to."
In addition to running Avenue Capital as chairman and CEO, Lasry owns a stake in the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks. He spoke to "Squawk Box" from the eighth annual CNBC and Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference.

**Don't go over the top!  Exchanges have welcomed this move.**
What Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About New York's New Inquiry
Some of the startups named today in the New York Attorney General's cryptocurrency exchange "inquiry" say they welcome the move.
As CoinDesk reported on Tuesday, the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has launched an inquiry into 13 cryptocurrency exchanges. The exchanges named were Coinbase's GDAX, Gemini, bitFlyer USA, Bitfinex, Bitstamp USA, Kraken, Bittrex, Poloniex, Binance, Tidex.com, Gate.io, itBit and Huobi.Pro.
Schneiderman's office sent letters to the exchanges, along with a detailed questionnaire that probes the firms' ownership, leadership, operations, terms of service, privacy policies, trading volumes, use of "bots," relationships with financial institutions - among other areas.
CoinDesk reached out to the 13 exchanges, and as of press time, five - Gemini, Bittrex, Poloniex, bitFlyer and Bitfinex - replied. Coinbase was not immediately available to comment, and the other exchanges have yet to respond to requests.
In a statement, Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said his company "applauds" the Attorney General's inquiry, stating that "we look forward to cooperating with and submitted our responses to the questionnaire."
"We continue to embrace thoughtful regulation and collaboration on our mission to help build the future of money," he added.
A representative for Bittrex struck a similar note, also stating that the exchange welcomes the opportunity to respond: "We look forward to working with NY Attorney General Schneiderman on our shared goal of improving transparency, accountability and security across all virtual currency trading platforms."
Josh Hawkins, vice president of marketing at Circle, Poloniex's parent company, told CoinDesk:
"We welcome all initiatives focused on increasing transparency and accountability in the space and look forward to working with the New York Attorney General's office. Protecting crypto currency investors and consumers has always been Circle's first priority."
BitFlyer USA, by way of compliance director Hailey Lennon, echoed the remarks about transparency, stating: "Transparency is important for consumer protection in this industry. We received the letter from the New York Attorney General and are reviewing the requests asked of our US exchange."
Kasper Rasmussen, communications director for Bitfinex, offered a more measured comment when reached.
"We can confirm that Bitfinex is aware of the New York Attorney General's inquiry regarding our operations, controls, and general user protections. Bitfinex is committed to compliance with authorities and regulators worldwide and we look forward to responding to this inquiry."
When reached for follow-up comment on the launch of its inquiry, a spokesperson for Schneiderman's office said that "we plan to make the information public at the end of the process since the goal here is to bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the crypto marketplace."
She declined to "comment or speculate" about potential legal action against the exchanges.

**Bitcoin is defending the key 200-day moving average support for the third consecutive day and may see a minor bounce to $8,700.** 
A break above $9,097 is needed to weaken the bearish case. A stronger sign of bearish invalidation would be a move above the weekly chart resistance at $9,533. 
So far, however, dips below the crucial 200-day moving average (MA) line have been short-lived. BTC is currently trading around $8,440 on Bitstamp, having found takers above the long-term average at $8,332 earlier today. 
The cryptocurrency printed a low of $7,998 on Tuesday but closed (UTC) above the 200-day MA, then located at $8,288. Similar price action was seen on Wednesday with sellers failing to secure a close below the long-term support.
**Bitcoin resistance could entice bargain hunters. After all, the MA is widely considered a barometer of a long-term trend**. 
**The cryptocurrency is set to be in a bull market if its charting higher lows above the 200-day MA, while lower lows below the MA represent bearish conditions.**

**Trump’s Trade War May Be Driving Chinese Investors to Bitcoin**
[ 
 
As the Chinese yuan falls in value due to factors like the ongoing trade war with the U.S., there are signs that locals are increasingly moving funds into bitcoin.
According to a [Bloomberg]( analysis of prices over 30 days, the negative correlation between the yuan and bitcoin has fallen to a record low in the last seven days.
While previously the Chinese government has sought to keep the value of its national currency above 7 CNY to the dollar, last month the yuan was allowed to slide below that level, dropping to its lowest for 10 years. The move was [reportedly]( in response to U.S. President Donald Trumps threats in early August to impose a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports.
That the drop in yuan value is causing a flight by Chinese investors is backed up by exchange data. Bloomberg spoke to Dr. Garrick Hileman, research director at Blockchain and [CoinDesk contributor]( who said that bitcoin prices on exchanges such as Huobi that cater more to Chinese traders are trading at a premium.
The inverse correlation between bitcoin and the yuan also notched up in April and May “as the tensions ratcheted up with the deterioration on U.S.-China trade relations,” Hileman said.
The report comes as new details emerge on China’s own national digital currency. The recently appointed chief of the digital currency division of the People’s Bank of China has said the upcoming digital yuan [will have features]( not offered by Facebook Libra.

**Pullback Over? Bitcoin Retakes $9K, Eyes Further Gains**
Having recovered from a five-day low hit yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) has potential for a move higher towards major resistance at $9,880, the technical charts indicate.
The cryptocurrency moved back above $9,000 in the Asian hours after the pullback from the recent high of $9,767 ran out of steam around the ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-candle moving average (MA).
As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,251 on Bitfinex, representing marginal losses over the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,270.
A bearish follow-through to Wednesday's bearish outside-day reversal would have been bad news for the bulls, but BTC instead appreciated by 4.5 percent on Thursday, keeping them in the game. Had BTC closed yesterday below $8,765 (Wednesday's low), the bears would have had the upper hand for the short-term.
**The pullback seems to have ended at $8,652, leaving bitcoin set to scale the resistance at $9,280 (double top neckline) and rise towards the 200-day MA located at $9,878.**

**Bullish Outlook at the moment**
**Bitcoin remains in a bullish territory for now and is looking at further gains, though a pullback is possible if support at $7,900 is breached, according to technical studies.**
The cryptocurrency's first attempt to scale the long-term descending trendline (drawn from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) failed on Monday and prices fell below $8,000 as expected at 12:00 UTC.
It's worth noting that the Bollinger bands (seen on the chart below) show the volatility dropped after BTC dipped below the psychological mark, likely signaling indecision among the bears. As a result, it is not surprising the dip below $8,000 was short-lived.
As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,145 on Bitfinex, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, but could soon report further gains as the hourly Bollinger bands indicate scope for a retest of $8,400-$8,500.

Tech investor Tim Draper, whose recent re-entry to India’s market was prompted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise to crackdown on corruption, nevertheless criticized India’s negative stance on cryptocurrencies during an interview with The Economic Times published yesterday, April 6.
Draper had returned to the Indian market in February 2017 - having exited it in 2016 due to a perceived lack of “rule of law” prompting Draper Fisher Jurvetson to sell their entire Indian portfolio - when the Mumbai-based startup backer Blume Ventures joined the Draper Venture Network.
India’s central bank had announced on April 5 that they would no longer deal with crypto-related accounts - not the direct government ban on crypto which had been falsely rumoured in early February. India’s Ministry of Finance had also criticized cryptocurrency as a “Ponzi scheme” without “intrinsic value” at the beginning of January.
Despite his positive outlook on Modi’s ability to stamp out corruption, Draper calls the Indian government’s denial of cryptocurrency as valid tender as “the stupidest thing,” also referencing China’s similar stance:
“If I had a meeting with Modi, I would have let him know he is making a huge mistake.”
Draper notes that “Bitcoin and [B]lockchain are the best things to have happened for business,” adding that “countries such as India, where billions of rupees are wasted on inefficiencies and needless paperwork, will benefit most from the ease and security of blockchain.” If India makes cryptocurrency illegal, then, according to Draper, “other countries will raise their hands to get all the [Indian Blockchain] entrepreneurs:”
“If the local authorities are banning crypto, then companies in the space should move elsewhere. The government needs to realize that it is stifling innovation and should instead be creating an environment where these ideas can be tested and promoted. They have the choice to be trendsetters and attract the world’s best engineers and coders, or lose their best and brightest to other regions.”
Draper, who is a Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast, said during the interview that Bitcoin “should be the national currency” of India, for Draper believes that its “global” nature and ability to store value will make it “acceptable everywhere for transactions” in a few years.
Draper also spoke about the potential for Blockchain to “roc[k] the venture capital business,” creating a competitive virtual environment where only the “flexible and reinvent[ive]” will be successful:
“Down the road, you won’t have to physically leave a place to choose a better government. From wherever I am, I can get social security from Chile, healthcare insurance from Canada, education from Russia. The whole system will be much more virtual.”
In regards to investments in future Indian Blockchain and crypto startups, Draper mentioned that Blume Ventures and Boost VC had co-invested in Unocoin, and that he will “continue to seek other opportunities.”
One of Unocoin’s co-founders, Sathvik Vishwanath, had said earlier this week that the central bank has not taken the “right direction” in regards to cryptocurrencies, citing that the bank’s ban will “cause panic among a few million people in India who are already using [cryptocurrencies.]”

**Bitcoin to Hit from $10,000, to $100,000 &amp; even $1 Million USD**
Due to Bitcoin's revolutionary "blockchain technology", Bitcoin's has a potential to go up from a $10,000, to $100,000 and even $1 Million USD, per Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has proven to be the best performing currency in the last 5 years. Not since the internet was released, Bitcoin is the most important invention the world has ever had, and [almost] no one knows it yet.
Everyone can video chat for free, to anyone across the world. Now, with Bitcoin &amp; blockchain technology, practically "anyone in the world" can send money directly to "anyone in the world" (in a Trusted &amp; Decentralized way) without using a costly third party (like PayPal).
They say, it will happen despite of the level of belief &amp; understanding -- just like in 1994, when people didn't believe "Internet shopping" and "Email communications" would work for the masses.)
Note: The population of the USA is ~320 Million People; and there are only ~16 Million Bitcoins in existence. The World population is 7.4 Billion People; and there will never be more than 21 Million Bitcoins in existence (which will happen around 2140) ~ Everyone can't have "more than one" Bitcoin.  (When will you get your "more than one" 1 Bitcoin?)

@_date: 2018-04-23 11:07:13
I'm hoping that when the American markets get going properly today that volume will increase markedly and we finally get over $9k and stay over.
@_date: 2018-04-12 10:09:21
-Over $7k today folks?
-Volume is going up slowly which is a good sign. This time yesterday we were around 7500 on GDAX, today 10700.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:44:59

**George Soros set to trade cryptocurrencies - Bloomberg**
(Reuters) - George Soros's $26 billion hedge fund is planning to trade cryptocurrencies, Bloomberg reported on Friday, months after the billionaire investor called the virtual currency a bubble.
Adam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at the New York-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade digital assets in the last few months, though was yet to make a wager, the report  said, citing people familiar with the matter.
A Soros representative declined to comment.
The financial world has been divided about betting on bitcoin &lt;BTC=BTSP&gt;, a digital token.
Billionaire Warren Buffett and JPMorgan's &lt;JPM.N&gt; Jamie Dimon have said they will not invest in cryptocurrencies, while Wall Street banks Morgan Stanley &lt;MS.N&gt; and Goldman Sachs &lt;GS.N&gt; have been open to clearing bitcoin futures.
Last year, Soros's hedge fund took an 8.99 percent stake in Overstock.com Inc &lt;OSTK.O&gt; to become the third-largest shareholder in the online retailer. The shares of the company surged when its unit held an initial coin offering.

It varies is the simple answer depending on market depth.  It could go up $100 if 10 Bitcoins are bought and then it could only go up $5 if 10 Bitcoins are bought.
Watch the market on GDAX and you will get a better idea.

@_date: 2019-09-03 07:54:23
I never bought any but I remember being told about Bitcoin when it was under $10, I think it was around $7-$9
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:43:45
If we can go up $150 a day I will be a very happy man. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:21:19
I know but it would be good for it to be up voted a lot as well :) 
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:29:30
I don't think most people are celebrating but the situation is far more positive compared to when it was around $6900.
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:57:09
I know I'm dreaming but it would be so nice to see volume at 100,000 on GDAX and the price shooting up to $15k.

The second quarter of 2018 may bring some respite for beleaguered bitcoin (BTC) bulls.
The world's largest cryptocurrency by market valuation seems to have found a bottom around the $6,500 mark, having dropped 50 percent in the first quarter - notably, the worst Q1 performance on record. Overall, its safe to say bulls have been struggling to find their feet as indicated by stagnant prices and a narrowing price range.
Yet, speculation is doing the rounds that big Wall Street names (such as Soros and Rockefeller) are set to enter the crypto space. If confirmed, the news could ramp up the bull case, as happened with the advent of bitcoin futures soon before bitcoin's December price peak.
However, history may be on bitcoin's side as well - an analysis of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index shows BTC tends to perform well in the second quarter.

Why have we reached the point of no return?  
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:46:29
It's hard to really know exactly what to think, like others have said I think we need to give the market a lot more time.  Obviously the situation compared to the ATH is not very good at all but if you compare the price now to what it was 1 year ago then it looks very, very good. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:10:15
I suggest we try and get past $7100 first. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:00:51

**Above $7K: Bitcoin Eyes Gains After Death Cross Fails**
Despite having witnessed a so-called "death cross" over the weekend, bitcoin (BTC) is now eyeing gains above the $7,000 mark.
The much-feared technical indicator (bearish crossover between the 50-day moving average (MA) and the 200-day MA) was confirmed over the weekend, but, as anticipated by CoinDesk, the oversold conditions seem to have put a floor under bitcoin prices.
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:14:56

**Bear Market 'Largely Over,' Crypto Fund Manager Claims**
Timothy Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Managment, LP, said Monday that the winter in cryptocurrency markets is "largely over."
Crypto Asset Management, which was founded last year and has roughly $20 million in assets under management, saw its CAMCrypto30 cryptocurrency index fall by 69 percent since its high in January. Enneking sees four reasons for the collapse.
Asset consolidation, regulatory concerns, massive liquidation by the Mt. Gox trustee and startups' selling crypto assets to pay salaries and expenses are all factors in the market's overall decline, he wrote.
"Consolidation after the amazing 2017 increase" drew back some of the funds invested in cryptocurrencies, he said.
Invsestors are also likely wary due to recent regulatory actions. While he did not cite any specific events, the report comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed startups with initial coin offerings.
It remains unclear what exactly the SEC is looking for, though an official confirmed "dozens" of investigations were underway.
The other two reasons likely had less of an impact, Enneking said.
These factors have mostly been priced into the cryptocurrency market already, which, despite the recent rout, is still up by over 600 percent in the last 15 months, he wrote.
Enneking also noted that bitcoin's share of the overall cryptocurrency market has fallen from 45.7 percent on Dec. 20 to 44.3 percent. This decline in "BTC dominance" has coincided with a decline in correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he wrote.
While the note does not comment on what declining correlation means, it could indicate that the quality of individual cryptocurrencies is beginning to have a greater influence on their market prices.
The combination of these factors indicate that the market should begin rebounding soon, he indicated in his report.

**Bitcoin Price Defends $8K But Pullback Still in Play**
Bitcoin (BTC) remains on the hunt for a major bullish breakout after bouncing back from an overnight dip.
Prices hit a four-day low of $7,823 yesterday reportedly due to whale dumping over $50 million-worth of the cryptocurrency in one Bitfinex trade. The news that New York's attorney general is taking a closer look at major cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the state may also have dampened the bull mood.
The sudden price drop raised the possibility that the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 had run out of steam.
However, BTC's sharp return from $7,873 to $8,160 this morning established the area around $7,800 as a strong support level and indicates a strong dip-demand mentality in the market. For the second time in the last three days, a dip below the $8,000 mark was quickly undone.
The recovery witnessed this morning adds credence to the bullish moving average studies.
As of writing, BTC is trading at $8,090 on Bitfinex - largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.
BTC will likely test supply around $8,400 in the next 24 hours. A high volume close (as per UTC) above that level would signal a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.
On the downside, $7,870 (today's low) is the key level to watch out for. BTC's failure to defend the key support level could yield a pullback to $7,510 (former resistance turned support).
Only a daily close below the ascending (bullish biased) 10-day MA would indicate the rally from the low of $6,425 has ended.

**Bitcoin's Price May Be Charting a Bull Reversal**
Bitcoin (BTC) price could create a major bullish technical pattern in the next few days, technical charts indicate.
It's a slightly confusing picture at the moment, however. The recent short-term bullish bias has been neutralized following BTC's close below (as per UTC) the 10-day moving average (MA) yesterday.
Further, the risk of a deeper pullback to $6,000 (February low and psychological support) look to have increased after Tuesday's 5.7 percent price drop.
However, that does not necessarily mean the bears are back in a commanding position, since the cryptocurrency is still holding well above the recent low of $5,755 (hit on June 24).
Notably, BTC could end up creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern (bullish pattern) soon if the bears fail to penetrate the immediate support of $6,000 in the next couple of days.
At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,350 on Bitfinex – down 3.6 percent on a 24-hour basis.
BTC's close below 10-day MA yesterday has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook.
The immediate support at $6,000 could be put to test in the next day or two, but the probability of a break below that level is low.
A high volume rebound from $6,000 would help BTC chart an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern.
A daily close (as per UTC) below $6,000 would boost the odds of a drop below $5,755 (June 24 low).

**Bitcoin remains on the hunt for a bullish break above the $10,000 mark.**
There is a risk of a pullback to $8,650-$8,600 in the short-term.
Only a close below the ascending 10-day MA at $8,671 would abort the short-term bullish view.

I agree with this, a lot depends on the size of the transactions.  I would say if you are buying the odd thing here or there no one will care but if you start buying items worth over say $500 and a lot of them, then it could start looking a bit dodgy.

**Bear Market 'Largely Over,' Crypto Fund Manager Claims**
Timothy Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Managment, LP, said Monday that the winter in cryptocurrency markets is "largely over."
Crypto Asset Management, which was founded last year and has roughly $20 million in assets under management, saw its CAMCrypto30 cryptocurrency index fall by 69 percent since its high in January. Enneking sees four reasons for the collapse.
Asset consolidation, regulatory concerns, massive liquidation by the Mt. Gox trustee and startups' selling crypto assets to pay salaries and expenses are all factors in the market's overall decline, he wrote.
"Consolidation after the amazing 2017 increase" drew back some of the funds invested in cryptocurrencies, he said.
Invsestors are also likely wary due to recent regulatory actions. While he did not cite any specific events, the report comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed startups with initial coin offerings.
It remains unclear what exactly the SEC is looking for, though an official confirmed "dozens" of investigations were underway.
The other two reasons likely had less of an impact, Enneking said.
These factors have mostly been priced into the cryptocurrency market already, which, despite the recent rout, is still up by over 600 percent in the last 15 months, he wrote.
Enneking also noted that bitcoin's share of the overall cryptocurrency market has fallen from 45.7 percent on Dec. 20 to 44.3 percent. This decline in "BTC dominance" has coincided with a decline in correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he wrote.
While the note does not comment on what declining correlation means, it could indicate that the quality of individual cryptocurrencies is beginning to have a greater influence on their market prices.
The combination of these factors indicate that the market should begin rebounding soon, he indicated in his report.

At the moment things are far from good if you compare everything to the ATH, I prefer to look at it from the perspective of it being nearly 7x higher then the $1k price it was around 1 year ago.  The next year will tell us a lot.  Like I say we are in total virgin territory.  Humans like to look back at the past and try and find similar examples, the fact is that this is 100% unique.  If anything it would make more sense to compare crypto with the early market for Gold.  That was very volatile in it's early years and took a long time to become stable.

**$8,300: Bitcoin Seeks Direction at Key Price Hurdle**
Bitcoin (BTC) remains in bullish territory today, but a major break above the long-term descending trendline has been elusive.
That failure on the part of the bulls means the cryptocurrency needs a major move above $8,300 soon to lessen the risks of another sell-off. The trendline resistance is around $8,285 currently.
However, soon before press time, BTC was closing in on that target level and changing hands at $8,226 on Bitfinex (up 1.4 percent on a 24-hour basis). So, the next few hours are likely to determine the pattern going forward.
A high-volume break above $8,300 would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open the doors for a move toward $8,800 (10-week MA).
Repeated rejection at the key trendline hurdle would boost the odds of a deeper pullback to $7,510-$7,200.

I recently tried to convert about 6 BTC using Changelly.com. It's not the first time I used their site. I have used it before, a couple months ago, and without issues. Now, with my most recent transaction they suddenly put the transaction on hold AFTER i sent the coins. Their system didn't even send a message about that. I had to email them and they replied it was put on hold because my transaction looked suspicious and was put on hold because of that.
They said we needed to follow a multi-step KYC procedure in order to release the funds.
So I sent them a picture of me holding my ID card and a paper reading "changelly" as they requested. I sent it to them and they replied I also need to send official proof of the original funds. I need to proof I'm the rightful owner of these funds.
I mined those coins back in 2011 and I looked everywhere but can't find anything that can proof this. I haven't keept track of all that shit back in the days. I did find an old email backup but couldn't find emails from mining pools or anything anymore. I probably deleted it years ago already.
The past years I have converted these coins to other coins many times a year and I always used sites like changelly, shapeshift, mortphtoken, xmr.to, coinswitch, flyp.me,.... I have used many sites in the past, depending on their rates. But I never kept track of these transactions so I can't really proof anything now.
In 2015 I also won some coins on a gambling site but that site does no longer exist. Those coins are all in one wallet at a certain point in time. I did find a screenshot of that page in my old emails. I sent it to Changelly too.
But how am I supposed to proof that I'm the owner of my coins now? I don't have a complete transaction history leading to a point where I can proof ownership at all.
I already explained this whole story to Changelly last friday. But they haven't replied to it yet and this is worrying me very much.
Are they allowed to just keep my funds for such a long time, like they are doing to me now?

**Pullback Over? Bitcoin Retakes $9K, Eyes Further Gains**
Having recovered from a five-day low hit yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) has potential for a move higher towards major resistance at $9,880, the technical charts indicate.
The cryptocurrency moved back above $9,000 in the Asian hours after the pullback from the recent high of $9,767 ran out of steam around the ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-candle moving average (MA).
As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,251 on Bitfinex, representing marginal losses over the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,270.
A bearish follow-through to Wednesday's bearish outside-day reversal would have been bad news for the bulls, but BTC instead appreciated by 4.5 percent on Thursday, keeping them in the game. Had BTC closed yesterday below $8,765 (Wednesday's low), the bears would have had the upper hand for the short-term.
View **The pullback seems to have ended at $8,652, leaving bitcoin set to scale the resistance at $9,280 (double top neckline) and rise towards the 200-day MA located at $9,878.**

**Bitcoin Price Climbs to 40-Day High Above $9,200**
Bitcoin's price climbed above $9,200 on Tuesday to hit a 40-day high, according to data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).
Following a steady increase over the past week, the price of world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped above $9,000 soon after the morning trading session began around 00:30 UTC, after which it continued to climb up to as high as $9,220.97 at around 2:00 UTC.
The price is at its highest point since March 14, when bitcoin dropped $800 within one trading day to reach a one-month low around $8,000. Following the plunge, the cryptocurrency's price declined to as low as $6,593 on March 30, reflecting what is now a 39% gain since that market bottom.

**HODL On: In Defense of Bitcoin's Best Investment Strategy**
Steven Hopkins is chief operating officer and general counsel of Medici Ventures, an Overstock.com subsidiary focused on the advancement of blockchain technology.
In 1987's Black Monday stock market crash, Sam Walton, the world's richest man, lost more than half a billion dollars in a few hours.
When reached for comment, Walton said, "It's paper anyway. As far as I'm concerned we're focusing totally on the company doing well and taking care of our customers."
He didn't care about dollars; he cared about his asset Wal-Mart, and he still owned that.
History of the  In bitcoin's volatile and roller coaster past, "HODL" was the meme that bound the cryptocurrency community together. It stood for the proposition that we all believe in the future of bitcoin. It's both funny and insightful.
Here is the original post by GameKyuubi on a Bitcoin Talk forum (spelling errors and profanity included):
I AM HODLING
I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time. Still wrong. w/e. GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER. Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro. Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I'm not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~! Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT. NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD. I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU. You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. The people inbetween hold. In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.
so i've had some whiskey
actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky
sue me
(But only if it's payable in BTC)
It was not about bitcoin versus bitcoin cash or 1,000 other cryptocurrencies. It was bitcoin vs. the world and we ALL embraced it.
It only took 11 minutes for this post to become a meme that became the rallying cry for the entire crypto world. We were all on the same rollercoaster ride and GameKyuubi, in the depths of his frustration, had (sort of) elegantly articulated both what it feels like and the best trading strategy for an asset this volatile.
Buy and HODL.
The good traders GameKyuubi was wrong about only one thing: There aren't any good traders.
There are lots of us who believe we are good traders. But we aren't. Of course, some of the loudest voices on Reddit regularly remind us about how well they time the market. Except when they don't time the market well.
A paper published last October by the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley entitled "Do Day Traders Rationally Learn About Their Ability?" used nearly 15 years of stock market day trading data to conclude that all day traders are irrational, the vast majority of day traders lose money, and even when day traders are successful, they "irrationally attribute success disproportionately to their ability rather than luck."
This sounds exactly like the crypto trader. Any post you see mocking HODL is likely someone who thinks they are really smart because they made money by trading crypto last year.
Of course, their success was due to their unique trading ability and not the fact that the entire market rose like a rocket.
HODLing works Still, empirically, even in volatile assets like bitcoin, carefully choosing an asset and holding long-term positions has proven to offer the best return.
Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of modern times, has often said that he only invests in what he knows. His preferred holding period: forever. With that model, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, has averaged a 19 percent annual return since 1965 which means it has risen more than 1 million percent.
Theoretical models that assume participants know when markets will move against them can offer better returns but, in practice, market movements cannot be reliably predicted so even when people like Bernie Madoff try to make us think that they've figured it out, they haven't.
Long-term investment in quality assets remains the only reliable investment strategy.
Simply put, HODLing works.
More possibilities For those not interested in limiting their activity to HODLing, there are two new and useful ideas that have begun bouncing around that really do advance cryptocurrencies:  and 
BUIDL has been used to help remind us that, in the words of a CypherPunk's Manifesto, "Cypherpunks write code." In order for the blockchain to really be useful and valuable, we need to build stuff on it. Watching the price go up and down either as a trader or a HODLer does nothing to make bitcoin work better.
We need to create some of the promised applications that can really change the world. To date, the blockchain community has fallen short in this regard outside of the areas of payments but there are some real wins.
Just this weekend, Voatz, a Medici Ventures portfolio company is running party county convention voting in Utah, state convention voting in Michigan and state primary voting for overseas and military voters in West Virginia, all on a blockchain platform.
Blockchain voting is a simple application, but it is one that can bring a much-needed security and transparency to elections. And we are doing it now.
SPEDN is a nod to the many of us who realize that, for bitcoin to be useful, we need to be able to spend it to buy things. And I mean everything. It really doesn't matter whether it is through second-layer solutions like lightning or forks like bitcoin cash; we need more ways to use cryptocurrencies in real-world transactions.
A focus here, rather than complaining about HODLers would be helpful. We need many more merchants to accept cryptocurrency before it becomes useful. Options to spend bitcoin remain severely limited in most areas and this will ultimately limit bitcoin's value.
As for me, I will HODL until I can buy useful stuff and SPEDN.
HODL on This year has seen intense regulatory pressure on cryptocurrencies and its time we stop pretending that HODL was stupid. It isn't and it wasn't. Anyone who doesn't like the HODL mentality needs to give HODLers something else they can do with their bitcoins.
Trading is no solution for intelligent people. What we need are new ways to use cryptocurrency.
We need BUIDLers and merchants who will let us be SPEDNers.

Selling pressure in cryptocurrencies could ease after tax day.
The April 15 income-tax filing deadline is contributing to crypto’s falling prices as investors who won big betting on the digital tokens sell some of their remaining holdings to pay $25 billion in capital-gains levies, Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in a note Thursday. Bitcoin dropped more than 40 percent over the past month, including a 2.4 percent decline on Thursday to $6,664 as of 9:39 a.m. in New York.
“This is a massive outflow from crypto to dollars,” Lee wrote. “Historical estimates are each $1 of USD outflow is $20-$25 impact on crypto market value.”
Lee says that $25 billion prediction -- derived from his estimate that U.S. households had $92 billion in taxable gains from cryptocurrencies in 2017 -- would represent 20 percent of capital-gains tax receipts to the U.S. Treasury. He estimates total capital gains receipts will hit a record $168 billion for tax-year 2017.
A crypto bull who maintains a year-end price target on Bitcoin of $25,000, Lee sees the selling pressure passing.
“We still like Bitcoin and large-caps,” he said, adding that “while we believe the bear market for alt coins is largely over, we do not see upside for alts until mid-August.”

 **Weekly Bitcoin Price Indicator Prints Strongest Bull Signal Since Early 2018**
 [ 
 
A technical indicator used to identify the momentum behind asset prices is registering its highest value since the beginning of 2018 when applied to bitcoin, a possible positive sign for the cryptocurrency’s market. 
The [relative strength index]( (RSI) takes into account the speed and change in price movements, i.e. momentum, to reveal when the trend of the underlying asset is shifting from bearish to bullish market conditions and vice versa, as well as when it has become overextended.
Traditionally, an RSI value above 70 is considered to be “overbought” and a pullback in price becomes likely, whereas a value below 30 depicts an “oversold” market that is usually due for a positive correction.
The RSI of 50 tends to act as the dividing line between a market that is bullish and one that is not.
Bitcoin’s RSI on the weekly time frame, which speaks to the momentum of its longer-term trend, is showing newfound strength while printing 65 – its highest value since the week of Jan. 8, 2018, just a few weeks after the cryptocurrency reached its all-time high near $20,000.
 
As is shown in Bitcoin’s weekly price chart above, the RSI has indeed surpassed the traditional bull market barrier of 50, as well as the range of 53-60, which acted as a base during the 2016-2017 bull market as well as resistance to its preceding bear market.
From early 2014 to late 2015, the weekly RSI was unable to scale above 60, capping any momentum the cryptocurrency had gained during that stretch.
In October of 2015, however, the RSI was finally able to break above the level, in turn showing the momentum had gained enough strength to shift the entire market from a bear to bull trend. Bitcoin’s price then went on to rally some 8,000 percent all while the weekly RSI remained above 53.
Interestingly, the same development seems to have just occurred with bitcoin’s latest push [above $6,000, ]( its market momentum firmly back in historically bullish territory.
All said, the RSI values on the lower time frames are already overbought so corrections in price can be expected, but the longer term bullish view on bitcoin’s market will remain intact so as long as its weekly RSI can defend 53, the base RSI of the previous bull market.
A general rule of thumb is to use indicators like the RSI in conjunction with other indicators to avoid any false signals. In this case, bitcoin’s price trading above the [200-day moving average]( and its [MACD]( completed a bullish cross indeed solidify the bullish argument presented by the weekly RSI.

 Unabashed Bitcoin Bull Thomas Lee Says the Market Is Wrong
 
 
* Fundstrat research head says fair value is around $14,800
* Lee had predicted Bitcoin would be worth $25,000 by year-end
 It’s hard to keep a Bitcoin bull down.
Back in May, Thomas Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors was predicting a rally to $25,000 by the [end of the year]( And despite things not playing quite in his favor -- the cryptocurrency is currently trading below $3,400 -- he’s sticking to his guns.
Bitcoin’s fair value, given the number of active wallet addresses, usage per account and factors influencing supply, is between $13,800 and $14,800, he said in a note Thursday. His explanation for the divergence include last year’s meteoric rally, a “meltdown” in the macroeconomic climate and treasury sales during initial coin offerings.
 “Fair value is significantly higher than the current price of Bitcoin,” he wrote. “In fact, working backwards, to solve for the current price of Bitcoin, this implies crypto wallets should fall to 17 million from 50 million currently.” 
 
User adoption and Bitcoin’s acceptance as an asset class are the key factors that will drive it higher beyond 2018. If Bitcoin wallets approach just 7 percent of Visa’s 4.5 billion account holders, fair value would be $150,000 per Bitcoin according to his model, he said.
“We are tired of people asking us about target prices,” he said, declining to update his year-end forecast.

# This Price Chart Indicates Bitcoin’s Bulls Are Back in Business
 
Bitcoin (BTC) is looking increasingly bullish on a key technical chart following its strong move above $4,000.
The leading cryptocurrency by market value first teased bullish reversal on Dec. 17 with the creation of an “outside reversal” candle on the widely followed 3-day chart. The early indicator of a bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, needed confirmation in the form of a positive follow-through.
Alongside BTC’s $600 rally, the cryptocurrency closed above $4,000 yesterday confirming the bullish reversal on the 3-day chart.
BTC, therefore, could rise to next major resistance of $4,400 in the near-term.
As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $4,000 on Bitstamp, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.
Confirmation of the bearish-to-bullish trend change can be seen on the 3-day chart above, where the last candle has ended well above $3,590 – the high of Monday’s outside reversal candle.
Adding credence to that positive trend change is BTC’s move above the 10-candle exponential moving average (EMA) yesterday.
Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has jumped into undersold territory, validating a bullish divergence created on Dec. 15.
On the daily chart, BTC created a “gravestone doji” candle on Wednesday – widely considered an early sign of bearish reversal. The recovery rally from 15-month lows near $3,100 would likely have ended had BTC closed yesterday below $3,642 (Wednesday’s low).
The cryptocurrency, however, closed well above $3,924 (high of gravestone doji), reinforcing the bullish view put forward by Tuesday’s convincing close above $3,633.
Other technical studies are also biased toward the bulls. For instance, the 5- and 10-day EMAs are trending north and the 14-day RSI is holding well above 50.00.
* A bullish reversal is confirmed on the three-day chart.
* BTC could extend the ongoing rally to $4,400 in the next few days.
* A daily close below $3,633 would abort the bullish setup, although the probability of a bearish close happening in the near term is low.

# Bitcoin’s Tick Problem (Getting Screwed on Crypto Exchanges)
 
Published writers say it. Powerful businesspeople say it. Elite athletes say it. Investors with a track record of smart decision-making say it; “Consistency is the key to success.”
In cryptocurrency, many investors say bitcoin is a store of value, a digital version of gold. But bitcoin doesn’t behave like gold – offering a stable way to hold value long-term. Bitcoin often seems like a pretty inconsistent and manipulated market. For example, why does bitcoin trade at a penny tick size on most major cryptocurrency exchanges?
‘Tick size’ is a term meant to refer to the minimum quoting and trading amount available on an exchange. When bitcoin was worth a few dollars, a penny tick size made sense. When bitcoin was worth $100, penny ticks were reasonable.
At over $1,000, it creates problems. It disincentivizes standing orders while incentivizing volatility.
Imagine this scenario: Bitcoin is trading at $3,500.03. A human trader puts in a limit order to buy at $3,500.00. An automated trading system then “penny jumps” the human trader by putting in a small buy order at $3,500.01.
The systemized trader’s order will get filled first.
Automated cryptocurrency trading systems take comfort in these scenarios. This is because the orders of human traders need to get filled before they lose money. Therefore, systemized trades will always be one step ahead of any human with such small spreads. This happens constantly on cryptocurrency exchanges.
High-volume bitcoin traders are using systemization algorithms. The average trader is using manual or simple bot orders. These are not as easily adjustable on the fly to the whims of low tick sizes.
 
Bitcoin behaves unlike any other financial asset many have ever traded.
Most people buying financial assets try to get the highest quantity for the lowest price possible. Bitcoin is often the opposite, however. Traders try to buy the least amount possible at a higher price.
This is especially true with one penny ticks because of a combination of small order sizes and tiny spreads.
 This Has Been Studied Before
In the foreign exchange market and equities markets, there is some precedent to changing tick sizes.
Forex markets, for example, decided to do an experiment: Lower overall tick size for currencies from what’s called a pip (0.0001) to decimal pip (0.00001).
The result? More high frequency traders with computerized algorithms “jumping” regular traders. This created uneven pricing, as basic bots and human traders simply don’t account for more decimals.
 
The SEC also did a review of this. They [performed a tick size pilot]( involving small cap stocks. Results show increased depth, but decreased price quality. In addition, the depth increase appears to be related to large market orders. Crypto doesn’t entail millions of dollars in trades very often – that is executed in over-the-counter, not the spot market.
Imagine, for instance, that tick sizes for crypto were even lower than a penny. This would mean more opportunity for advanced HFT and less for retail traders. Conversely, having higher tick sizes would mean better trading advantages to average investors.
The larger the tick, the better for trading – which is obtaining highest quantity for the lowest price, as mentioned about. The smaller the tick, the worse pricing average traders/investors get.
 A Call to Crypto Exchanges
Exchanges should take heed as changing tick sizes clearly isn’t a crazy idea. In fact, it’s something that should be experimented with given the nature of crypto as a new era in finance. Indeed, having a larger tick size in crypto isn’t unprecedented. CME, for example, [lists bitcoin futures with a $5 tick size](
Adding inefficiencies to the market, sounds like existing banking, doesn’t it? Some may argue increased spreads are bad because it creates profit for middlemen who don’t actually do anything.
Actually, spreads in markets do serve a purpose. There is no specific rule on this per se. (Only the wisdom that optimal spreads should be as tight as possible). This means bids and asks should be close together while still attracting enough liquidity on either side of it to transact.
Still, it’s clear that right now, one penny spreads in bitcoin do not attract enough liquidity to transact at the best bid and offer. There’s just a bunch of jumping going on, with orders placed and removed all the time. This is why small tick sizes are really hard to understand from a trading point of view.
Increasing bitcoin’s tick size from one penny to $0.50 or $1 would go a long way in leveling the playing field for human traders. It would also increase the cost for traders currently penny jumping and manipulating the overall price.
Pactum Capital focuses on cryptocurrency trading and market making. Our firm is sometimes several percentage points of daily volume on regulated U.S. exchanges. But, bitcoin’s tick sizes are continually perplexing to us.
So, why does bitcoin still trade with a penny tick size on most major exchanges?
It’s a question we’d like to see answered in 2019.

# Panic Mode? What a Wall Street Chart Tells Us About Bitcoin’s Price
 
Investing in financial markets can be an emotional roller-coaster and the bitcoin market is no exception.
When it comes to investment, human emotions tend to oscillate between two extremes – fear and greed – and the constant balancing act between the two creates a cycle of market emotions.  
For years, traders and investors alike have studied the cycle of market emotions with the help of a chart known as the “Wall Street Cheat Sheet.” (See link at top for picture).
As seen above, at the top of the market cycle is “euphoria” – a point of maximum financial risk.
This is the time when investors think nothing can go wrong and a self-feeding cycle is established: more investors enter the market for its stellar returns, leading to a further rise in price and valuations reach dizzying heights before, eventually, reality bites hard.
The cryptocurrency market was gripped by euphoria in the last quarter of 2017. Bitcoin prices rose from $6,000 to $20,000 within seven weeks on speculation that futures launch would open floodgates for large institutions to buy cryptos.
Further, every other altcoin, regardless of its fundamental story, had rallied to record highs by the first week of January. Most pundits came out with bitcoin targets of $50,000 or more at the time.
The bubble, however, was pricked just two weeks into January by a regulatory crackdown in China and South Korea – two of the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies back then.
 Where are we now?
Since then, the bitcoin market has arguably gone through “complacency,” “anxiety” and “denial.”
In this interpretation, the denial stage, it could be argued, lasted for five months as BTC’s repeated defense of $6,000 offered hope that the broader market and altcoins with strong fundamentals would recover lost ground before the year-end.
Those hopes, however, were shattered as BTC nosedived below $6,000 on Nov. 14, pushing the bitcoin market into the “panic” stage, causing investors to look for an exit with no price floor in sight.
The price of bitcoin has since fallen nearly 50 percent from the $6,000 mark, trading at an average price of $3,327 according to CoinDesk data at press time. More importantly, trading volumes jumped more than 30 percent month-on-month in November. That high-volume sell-off likely indicates many weaker hands have left the market.
The argument for capitulation not having set in yet is that it is usually a single extreme selling event, short in duration but backed by a surge in sell volume and subsequent buy volume.
As recent as Nov. 1, bitcoin suffered just that and it seems panic is still the most likely candidate for bitcoin’s current stage in its market cycle, at least until a break below the psychological price level of $3,000 incites capitulation.
 What’s next?
The result of capitulation is a lengthy period of sideways price action and misery felt by investors.
So this leaves us studying the market cycle after recent violent price drops, searching for visual cues of a “bottoming out” of the current bear trend.
And by having examined the different cycles it’s safe to assume bitcoin is close, but not quite there.
The first stage after capitulation is ‘anger,’ when investors look for some reason for the horrific losses they’ve just experienced. 
Finally, reality sets in for investors who then shift from feeling anger to “depression” in regards to the financial state they are left in and this is when the bottom hits.
When all hope in the market is lost in the eyes of the public, the market quietly starts to pick up a bid. At this stage, investors have been emotionally battered to the extent they will not believe any rally from here on out can be sustainable.
Although it may be hard to grasp, this point of what seems like utter disaster can be seen as the point of maximum financial opportunity and minimum risk. With all the sellers now out of the market, accumulation at basement prices can begin, which eventually provides the energy for the start of the next market cycle.
Like billionaire investor Warren Buffett famously said, be “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”
