Hi First, thanks for the english I'm french guy from Québec in Canada so I'm not as I want lol.
In fact we strongly suggest to the seller to have proof of item shipped, like tracking number or digital signature on package delivery. In that case, if the buyer sign the delivery confirmation then the seller will have proof of delivery success. 
People on the forum have mentionned a hole in this system if the seller send an empty package with tacking number. First if the buyer don't open the package before signing it he assume the loss. But he should open the package and say ok everything is in good condition so I sign. 
Another solution (that I'm currently working on it) will be the reshipping service. Seller send package to my escrow service, We confirm that everything is correct, then we resend the package to the seller. In that case the fees are higher but the risk is near to none for each party.
I'm working on everything to make it better and also on a reputation system based for the trust. If you have anythign else just contact me it will be a pleasure to answers other questions.

Hi, I'm the owner of  the new bitcoin escrow BTcrow.com, I still have few customers right now and I'm currently implementing 2 type of escrow:
1) like ClearCoin was working (donation to Faucet if dispute unresolved)
2) Resolution Center (BTCrow act as third party if dispute)
I'm working on getting a reshipping service in order to have more secure transactions for both parties.
Also there's an official thread in order to post your comments or suggestions at the bitcoin forum. If I can do anythign else to help people secure their bitcoin transactions, please let me know
