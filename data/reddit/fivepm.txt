"I don't think they are going to let that happen." 
WHO?! Who dares take control of our decentralized currency?!

I am someone with 0 btc but watching for a point to enter.
Is now a good time to enter? I am worried about buying at $30 and see it drop...But of course, today's high is $31 already, might even rise further in the near future.
My original plan was to wait til it drops back to $5-10.

Just being a good redditor, there is currently a site called dota2lounge.com, it allows you to bet on matches with in-game items.
I thought of making an underground site to accept such bets (but in money) on esports, but since its on the clear web, I expect it to be taking down rather quickly. I guess if one have the necessary resources, the website can be hosted in some nation with lax laws. Im not very sure about this though.

Cool, and its anonymous!

Thanks, that was very informative. Will P&amp;D activities benefit bitcoins? (Assuming most of us just holding on to coins to use for item purchases.)

I share your point of view. The rewards for getting a miner in a few months time seem so shitty compared to the present moment. But of course, it can be argued that it will be even shittier to have no mining capabilities...

Is it possible to send 0.xxxxx btc? And imbed a morse code into the XXX part? Just send "come to reddit and I will return you your btc".

Trading noob here, so do you mean there has to be buy orders at the other end for the seller to profit? If so, I assume even at $35-$39.99, it would be tough to sell as well?

I am a bitcoin noob but can someone comment on this? I believe the price of bitcoins will drop because the ASIC miners will mine and sell immediately, and ALOT at the same time due to the the power of ASIC. But I think my view is flawed because some people will hold onto the newly mined btc, maybe to wait till the price is right in the future (is there any other reason to hold onto bitcoins?)
How does ASIC hardware create demand? Its more like creating a huge supply that will outweigh demand at this current point of time.
Can anyone give some comments? Im thinking of getting a BL SC at the moment hehe. I chanced upon btc a year ago when it fell from $40 to $5, thought it was interesting but didnt invest =(
