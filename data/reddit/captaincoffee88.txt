A testnet for it will launch in May according to this.
I'm all for it...as long as Satoshi is one of the 12 who generates the parameters.

This is why we need a decentralized LocalBitcoin/BitMessage p2p application with reputation system. No escrow. Just a way to arrange an in-person transaction time/location and weed out bad actors with low reputation.

They can use the Local Trader on Mycelium app

No, but there is a world of difference between "everybody" and "server farms"
If it was 2010 and everyone running bitcoind Generating Coins, that's decentralization.
It is 2014 and everyone is running electrum and we've got things like this:
That's not decentralization. 
Also, which direction is it headed? More centralized is the answer. We've got 14 mining pools which do most of the blocks. Fast forward and we'll have even less.

**B**uy and sell without the need for a bank account.
**I**nternational, low fee, secure peer2peer network is open to everyone.
**T**op-grade cryptology means a secure protocol - your money is safe.
**C**oins are used as units of account on the network, capped at a hard limit of 21 million.
**O**pen source by design- everyone can audit Bitcoin via the code and global public ledger of transactions.
**I**nnovative algorithms allow a truly trust-less currency system, a first in history.
**N**onstop growth in ingenuity, demand, and potential.

Yeah, I recognized both voices as Stephanie and Brian from Sex and Science Hour immediately.

Not bad. But I still think [this one]( is the best one out there for the price/function/design.

If ever there was a cause worthy of Satoshi spending bitcoins...surely this is it?

He's using the wrong bitcoin symbol.

That "GOVERNMENT ID" label looks dystopian as hell.

I use about 1/2 the amount of words at the original. It's kind of hard to convey all the same information in half the data. This is okay though because concise, 7 point statements were requested.
Regarding my last line, yes I could have said "Nodes hashMerkleRoot() while hashing the hash of the block headers if a new transaction is propagated throughout the network." The ending statement I gave instead was a better indicator of what bitcoin is however. It's a growing idea, there are very smart devs working on it all the time, and there is a sales hook to it as well. It's purpose was to both capture the identity of Bitcoin, and entice the reader to learn more.
So I think my last sentence does mean something, and is as justified to be there as any other line I chose. And as far as being contrived, maybe. It's still informative and distills the goods IMO.

More people should use Kraken. But surprisingly not for any of the reasons listed in this infographic.
Jesse Powell, the person behind the website, has been very publicly outspoken with forward-thinking security and auditing practices of not only his site but cryptocurrencies themselves.
Kraken was the first exchange to prove reserves and therefore set it as an industry standard with many exchanges rushing to copy this effort with their own reports. The difference is, Kraken did it with almost no one asking them whereas others needed to be inundated with requested before doing anything about it.
However I understand that BTC-e has something going for it that many people desire, trading anonymously. And that's something Kraken can't do. I predict that once something terrible happens at BTC-e (and lets not kid ourselves-it's only a matter of time) most of the trading will find itself heading over to Kraken and Bitstamp.

Any source for that timeline? The github hasnt been updated in months.

He couldn't be more clear:
The coins were taken by force, by a government. The "justification" likely came from money laundering regulations, hence his "FATF country" reference.
