I appreciate the feedback. We've been running for a bit over a month now.
However, I don't believe it's fair to compare our website to something like skycig. While we operate in the same industry, we have very different business models. They mostly sell entry level cig-alikes with pre-filled cartridges (cartomizers), whereas we cater to established vapers with APV setups. As a result, our menu is smaller than most, but also more refined.
As far as pricing goes, you get what you pay for. The e-cigarettes found on skycig are a great way to learn about the new alternative, but are not a permanent solution. Most people who make a permanent switch to e-cigarettes move onto more advanced setups (longer lasting battery, support for larger and better tanks, more flavour, better vapour production, voltage/wattage control, etc.). Although cig-alikes may seem like a more cost effective solution in the short-term, in the long run they are quite a bit more expensive than a high-end setup. With skycig, a single kit is not going to cut it. You will constantly have to buy new batteries and new cartridges, and your costs are going to balloon over a period of several months. The high-end setups that we cater to may be a more expensive initial investment, but unlike cig-alikes, are a one-time purchase. With a high-end setup, you simply need to purchase one APV kit ($40-$200) and a few atomizers ($5-$20), and your only additional cost will be juice (which, if you look at our website, is quite a bit cheaper than constantly buying pre-filled cartridges).
Another huge difference here is that our product is manufactured in Canada, not China. Besides a huge difference in quality, Chinese e-juice is notorious for having low quality control and harmful ingredients.
Hope that sheds some light on what we're trying to do :)
