For a while.

Every construct of modern society - a companies, money, morale, human rights, natioms, countries - are real only because we, as a human kind, collectively decided to THINK they are real. 
None of that is real - you will never persuade a monkey to give you banana for citizenship.
This collective thoughts enabled the rise of Homo Sapiens from small groups to cities and nations. Without these mind constructs we would never be physically able to form a group larger than 60-150 people to COLLABORATE on common goal like building a city. 
We would fight and tried to dominate within our social structure and had no common denominator. 
Add a constructed sentence like 'We are all neighbors, let's do it together' which made everyone believe he is the neighbor, and voilá - neoghborhood existed.
Seems like nothing, but our common thoughts are the greatest enablers of today.
If interested in subject, I recommend Harari: Sapiens book.

Yeah, however ee do have some info other traders in history didnt have, right? And the info is that the price will ONLY RISE IN LONG TERM, due to roots of bitcoin itself and limited amount only.
So there is my premise. Price will rise in long terms, but will dip every quarter - i don't know, maybe because few players can shift the whole price only by selling and buying?

Sold all my BTC today at $4100 (~1). My strategy is to make profit of the volatility, and you should too. No point in investing 1k USD @ 3000/BTC and wait 10 years. 
You should rather be part-time (10minutes per 3 days) investor that makes money off volatility. I jumped the wagon when BTC dropped to 1800, and after much thoughts I sold at 4100, netting cca $2300 in 3 weeks.
Had I been going the traditional route, I would HODL for next 10 years.
This approach now gives me the freedom to invest in BTC once I feel markets are reluctant to buy. 
My only risk here is that the price will only go higher, which I doubt. There is a new maximum reached - $4100, and people who are responsible for the price have already doubled their investment, therefore I am expecting dip to 3k range that will last couple months.
So the strategy is to hold to my earnings and current free-to-invest amount of money in cash, and once the BTC price drops, invest heavily and wait.
Rinse and repeat ad infinite. Once the price reaches 22k USD/BTC in 2022, I will have already made 100k+ profit in these little trades.

When will we want to pay woth Bitcoin?

So this means that BTC became unuseful for transactioning, yes? What is the use then? And what are the implications?
