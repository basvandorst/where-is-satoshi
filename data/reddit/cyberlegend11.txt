Funny how it said to meet you had to send .000001 BTC. Probably so the seller can see how much is in your wallet and see if you are the real deal 
@_date: 2019-07-28 18:03:45
Bitfinex but must go through browser to sign up
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:24:56
You are correct. Or say a farmer wants to guarantee his profit on wheat for the year so he will lock in a rate that’s good for him in case the price of wheat falls. I haven’t looked into this but I’m sure it can be done, as that is the whole point of a future contact.   An OBLIGATION to buy/sell a given asset at a certain time in the future.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:25:29
This is just FUD. You can use future contracts to go long or short 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:58:18
He will never ever do that. So we are in luck. Maybe in 7 years when he's out

Well to piggy back off the tech centered post above, I think what he’s trying to get at is if we are hoping to use this tech everyday so two examples 
Say we use bitcoin as cash (example). Then we would at some point need to burn all the cash and get bitcoin. So there’s the value. How else would we sort it all out. Would you rather have the government issue some sort of token and credit equal value of US dollar and we just do it all in one day? Not likely. This is a long process but even with investing in currencies there is no inherent value in buying yuan over US dollar except exchange rate. Same with bitcoin. Eventually everyone will use it. So to ask the question on calculating fair value isn’t the right way to look at it. 
Right now there may not be a ton of value because you can’t buy many things with it now except stuff from Newegg or overstock to name a couple. But everyone purchasing it will signal to businesses to accept it as payment. 
2nd example. Ethereum. Ether is used as gas in applications. So to buy gas now would save money in the future if eth is 20k a pop. Where hopefully we can have the whole world running of ethereum and everyone buying up ether to use to run this system. 
So IMO crypto is extremely undervalued 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:49:22
What’s funny is as BTC goes up that 2449 actually goes down faster with the rise in bitcoin price haha. But not gonna happen anytime soon. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 23:58:24
So u transferring usd from BTC-A-Trade to bank and back to Coinbase or what? Arbitrage is pretty clear but moving usd around exchanges can be difficult for some countries 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:38:23
Order books. What people are willing to sell versus buy is different between exchanges. 
They don't get their prices from one central service or company 
Sounds like a good arbitrage moment to me. Won't take to long to send from kraken to Coinbase 
Only drawback is I was wrong about time. By the time you get an order to go through on kraken BTC will be 25K
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:49:35
Fair point. Except exchanges that control most of the leverage trading are bitfinex and bitmex
Bitmex: everyone uses leverage and no one buys spot BTC here for the most part
Bitfinex: you must put BTC in funding account in order for them to use it. This also gains interest on BTC that is being lended to others
In your post you are referring to retail traders. Who don’t own that much BTC to begin with
This theory won’t work. As big money lends BTC to make a %. 
So good luck with all that
Again exchanges that lend out your BTC without you knowing are not only asking for trouble in case everyone and there Mom tries to bank run their BTC to wallets. But also their volume is so tiny compared to bitfinex and bitmex that i don’t think it would make a dent
Fair theory but retail traders taking BTC off exchange won’t change movement of price.  
I do however think ppl not using leverage would steady price a bit
Also the dump from last two days was someone selling spot BTC. Or at least that is what initialized the dump. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:15:34
Will never happen. Look what happened in turkey would they tried to stop internet and the whole country rioted in the streets. Internet will ever go away so the question is pretty irrelevant especially considering as a risk to cryptocurrency 
Edit: but once all this takes off and is everyday cash then you know there will be a movie with a supervillain trying to shut down the world internet

It’s way easier to dump a price than to pump is what he means. Bears are weak right now
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:53:20
Buy 4K 
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:38:39
There are many supports but I don’t even think support is 6.5. I’m thinking 6.6 because of slope.  We could go there and have a bounce to a lower high on weekly and then death to final support at 4k. Then we are back in business 
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:15:36
Your doing the real work here haha.
@_date: 2018-10-12 04:35:26
No. But if they gave up control today. There will be chaos
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:45:03
Good point. I didn’t think of the mt. Gox relationship. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 05:08:11
Well dxy and BTC has been inversely related for the most part. So that’s it. Don’t think whales bought 20k either. Sure they played a part in getting it there. But if stocks collapse then BTC will go up. As fiat will be worth less and less and ppl need to put their money somewhere. And sure BTC/usd will go up as usd because of usd value decreasing. But in any case ppl don’t put money into currencies that are losing value at an alarming rate(stock market crash, etc.)
@_date: 2018-10-15 21:31:08
Crashing the wrong word probably. But look at the past time tether went to .90 and reaction BTC had 
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:37:42
Not near future
No monetary policy. So big no no for most countries
What I think will happen is each country will get comfy with crypto and try to make a government crypto coin. For example UScoin. Then it will be accepted or rejected. Hopefully rejected
Then the debate for BTC will begin 
But I think it will take a long time. Very long
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:11:32
Or he’s saying 1 BTC =1 BTC 
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:27:25
Maybe. Weekly needs good close here and we get a doji. Next week will show direction this is heading
But everyone and their grandma is saying dump. So what’s that tell u
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:27:55
Right but it’s still the same currency. It’s just not physical. So no risk. Ur in BTC subreddit. Not a debit card/ Venmo sub, so I thought this was in regards to crypto Haha
I mean most transactions in US r cashless already but we still respect cash as legal tender. Banks don’t even hold cash anymore. They just do electronic balance sheet transfers. Same thing as in China. 
Currently only about 8% of Americans prefer cash over electronic. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:06:37
This has happened. Define big businesses. And do u mean as an only mode of transaction or an option?
One I know is overstock.com. They are fairly large. 
Others however did accept but canceled due to BTC crashing
Many others
So who knows
It’s all about risk for larger companies. 
For smaller companies u see all over the internet that take BTC. They don’t take on as much risk as say Microsoft. 
If businesses can ever pay taxes and suppliers in BTC. Then that will help in adoption imo. 
Someone in finance department can’t make a quality risk assessment if u accept BTC. Then have to transfer to usd for taxes,payroll, suppliers, cogs, etc. 
Not to mention. How would stock holders feel about all of this. Companies r in it for growth and usd. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 14:23:31
It’s kinda like republican/democrat debate. Some ppl are so tied down they won’t ever change their mind even if it makes sense 
I think the best definition for it is tribalism 
Free market will decide the fate of these coins when it is ready to do so
Considering free market is still debating. Means we are still very early in the game imo
My only thing to your question  is money and profits. From what I can see 
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:33:17
Banking issues for one.  No usd deposits on bitfinex 
Also tether is crashing. So tether exchanges have a premium. 
So double whammy
@_date: 2018-10-01 14:15:23
Most ppl stopped caring because the gains aren’t there anymore imo. Ppl in it for the money.  Everyone still around are the believers. 
Or leverage traders 
@_date: 2018-10-23 15:23:49
Where is your evidence
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:21:54
Ppl tend to get extremely salty when they buy something for 20k to find out it’s only worth 6k
Lol 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:27:14
Yes. The hodl concept is there to remind u that markets run in cycles and if u hodl then u don’t have to stress when bear hits. 
Ppl are funny. 
Traditional investors mad because equities don’t pay out like crypto does. 
But I agree. They have broken minds. Soon we will have ATH again
And then the whole BTC death conversation will repeat again
We will be telling our grandkids these stories and they will laugh as BTC is Worth 100k a piece by then lol 
This bear will be a blip on the radar eventually 
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:39:26
Haha that’s the crazy part. Is there is currently no way to accurately price BTC except by supply and demand. 
Ppl being sad because they are trapped at a loss and not willing to add money to the market is what will keep us down
Soon more institutions will get involved and ppl will start fomoing again. I can’t wait 
I however got started by reading the ethereum white paper. I thought it was the coolest idea I ever heard so I bought some. That was when it was $10. I never expected to make a single dime off of it. 
Crazy how every market participant has a unique story that contributes to the price. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:45:56
Always a great option. As countries adopting it and 100% of the ppl using it can be two different things
Also news is India is creating a county crypto coin. Although they ban and unban crypto every other month hahaha
I think btc will be a tool in the toolbox to finally take out the government. Or minimize it to such small power that they can’t do anything about it
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:47:34
I think ppl use the term die to mean that the price is going down heavily. No one thinks it will disappear. 
It’s a currency so it’s hard to put a value to it. A lot goes into pricing currencies. 
But as we speak now BTC isn’t ready to replace the dollar or euro. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 06:55:36
Sometimes experience is the best teacher. 
Also it could be your next door neighbor or even roommate for all you know. It’s called a VPN. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:17:29
Kraken. Or find a friend in a different country and have him run it through his bitfinex account
Honestly this could be a blessing in disguise for you. I would hold that BTC. You may want to feed your kids now but who knows, one day that BTC could feed your whole island. Instant gratification will bite u later down the road.

@_date: 2017-11-04 03:44:19
I operate in % gain. 
So say you made 500%
just say you made 500%
they ask "how much you start with?" 
then you say "pick a number"
if people do not understand % gain then they are not a true investor, therefore not worth your time.
I deal with the same conversation everyday.  when somebody's eyes light up when they hear your % gain then you know you found someone that will join the good fight
It sucks for people with no money though but you have to start somewhere.  10% of $100 is $10 and does not seem attractive to average person.  but 10% of 1,000,000 is $100,000.  Idk why people cannot understand % gain/loss concept but it is a problem, but its the only way to build your wealth.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:49:53
Futures will be good. Although highly volatile it could be good for a lot of people. 
One reason it's good is that it will make the regulators more comfortable by having future outlooks on bitcoin (at least here in the US)
It will help investors who are afraid of whether it will go up or down by locking in rates to purchase at a future date. 
Also trading the contract itself can be much cheaper or more lucrative in some cases. Therefore a lot more money will be involved due to lower cost of contract compared to buying BTC straight up
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:21:14
This in no way will bring more people to bitcoin which will help the rich folk get richer

@_date: 2017-11-20 18:52:50
We have a crash down to 5 k and then your screwed. More risk more reward!! 
Edit: just do leverage. That way you can get margin calls if things hit the fan. You don't want to be in debt with credit companies and your credit score be wrecked 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:02:09
I've been going long on bitcoin and doing multiple shorts of the ETC/BTC pair. Been making straight cash with leverage involved

Nothing in this world comes free. Meditate on that today 
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:14:23
Create a BTC wallet. There is some on iPhone, google chrome, or download straight to your PC.  Or you can send it directly to an exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:24:22
You will make the seed once you have the wallet and plug it in for the first time.  The seed is your password to the wallet. If someone has the seed then they can get in your ledger.  If your trying to do cold storage a safety deposit box would be a good idea 
Cons: you don't have immediate access(can't sell or buy stuff immediately)have to pay safety deposit fee
Pros: you don't have immediate access to it(prevents panic sell. If you take This option then I would go to a bank that is 3 hours drive so when you want to get weak hands then you have a three hour drive to think it over), and no one can steal it.  
I would just keep it in a safe in your home next to a double barrel 
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:00:41
This is great haha
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:22:47
Yeah because you can buy from a exchange and then send it to the ledger without any issue no matter where it is. 
To withdraw or send from the ledger you have to physically have the device in your hand and plugged into your computer. So if it is a safety deposit box you will not be able to sell unless you go get it 
@_date: 2019-04-29 15:31:33
Sweet.  So I get to learn something today
@_date: 2019-04-29 15:23:35
Bit pay takes out a monthly charge for “inactivity”
So hodl’ing on bitpay will decrease your wealth as compared to holding anywhere else in the world pretty much.  
Just in case you didn’t know. I think the charge is $5.  I once only had $5 on my bitpay and they took it all for the fee one month.

Yeah that’s just capital gains.  Tbh I wouldn’t tell Uncle Sam about $1000
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:50:19
Awesome.  Yeah it’s good to keep track. Up to you. If you play stupid the IRS are usually lax. It’s the ones who try to avoid taxes on purpose.  
IMO taxes are worthless and we shouldn’t give any money to the government. So fuck it 
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:46:03
Are you saying Uncle Sam found out about 35k in capital gains you didn’t report?
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:56:57
Your right about the Coinbase though. 
Two things could happen if everyone decided to not pay crypto taxes. Or taxes at all
-government shutdown (run out of money)
-they go all out war on crypto and everyone and try to shut stuff down
Only thing keeping option 2 open is a bunch of citizens that love their government too much and would rather fight amongst themselves then agree to be a little more free   
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:19:42
Why is this in bitcoin sub? Haha u really think ppl were “investing” in bitcoin or whatever crypto is out there
No it was a speculation that others would use it more and demand for that said crypto would go up. Therefore increasing price. This whole crypto is a big speculation
Funny how this post is being posted now and not 12 months ago. 
If you want to use BTC then use it and quit complaining about USD price of one.

You can accept I believe up to 17k in donations a year. 
Meaning that at most 17k you can tell IRS you were donated for providing some sort of free something on the internet and people just have you bitcoin. Say YouTube channel for example or blog. So that’s a little you can write off.  
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:35:19
Yeah it seems like it was fun for vendors during bull run. Now the price dropping faster than they can get it into cash. 
Think of how much Newegg was making off of gpu sales with customers using BTC back before 2018.

My first thought exactly. Coinbase custody part

So short BTC and quit getting on Reddit to remind people. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 23:18:53
There is some good TA signals that could mean this last dip was an intermediate bottom. Not going to mention exact signals here. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:09:01
Yes. Market makers I know only short through futures market and they buy on Coinbase. Futures only for shorting atm. Because you don’t need any BTC to short it. I agree with u tho. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:39:47
This case you would only tax $500 assuming the other $500 has already been taxed for income previously. 
Question. Is this really gambling you talking about or “investing” in BTC? 
There’s a tax reason I ask this

I’m confused. It took a second to show pending or a second to show confirmed in your wallet?

There is no volume. No one is trading BTC. Until volume picks up we go sideways 
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:19:41
I got the ledger nano S. it is really amazing. They are located in Europe so should ship fairly fast at a good rate. It has amazing functionality and it can hold BTC, ETH, and ethereum classic. 
It does require you to have google chrome which is a downside to certain people but other than that it has been an amazing purchase. Very secure and has a little screen on it to make it a little better. 
I believe trezor only does BTC? I'm more of an ETH guy so Nano S was the best option for me. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:28:27
You could own 1 BTC 
Or you could own .000001 bitcoin
Or you could own .0000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 bitcoin
And so on and so on 
So we can divide it infinitely.
For example if we used it as our worlds only currency. With 6 billion people everyone would have .0035 BTC if it was shared. 
Some will have 2000 in sure while others have .000001
Edit: never mind about the first part. My bad.
