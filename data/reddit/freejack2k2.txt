Usability has to increase a LOT...and my feeling is that this is only going to come when someone designs an app or interface that handles everything for the consumer, lets them enter the amount in their local currency, and they may never see the word "Bitcoin" at any step of the process. Let the speculators and investors buy the coin and accumulate it in their wallets, but the mainstream consumer needs a way of using this network that requires absolutely ZERO knowledge of Bitcoin. That's the only point at which it has a chance to achieve mainstream use and realistically, it won't be treated as a currency...just a settlement network.
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:19:00
What possible reason would cause a 200-300% gain, at this point? Bitcoin is a known, the media sees it as old news, it has not gained significant traction as a currency over the past several years, and it seems plagued by developer drama more than anything else, lately.
I just don't see the potential catalyst for this big bubble people keep waiting for. No single exchange now has the sway over the market that Mt. Gox did, at the time Willy manipulated the market.
@_date: 2016-04-19 02:11:50
Well, regardless of the reasons for the late 2013 bubble, I think that was a moment in time that is highly unlikely to return to Bitcoin, or any crypto for that matter...yet I constantly see people hoping, even counting on it. It's irritating. People shouldn't WANT parabolic price moves, they should want stable, slow growth.
@_date: 2016-04-18 07:31:15
The market was dictated by Mt. Gox. The Willy bot absolutely manipulated prices up, which caused media coverage, which caused hype, which caused bubble chasing...and as soon as the shoe shine boys started putting their money in, profit taking and collapse.
It's never going to happen again. People really need to get over it.
@_date: 2016-04-18 19:24:35
I watched it happen too, and I don't care if you were the guy who discovered the bot, it was definitely having an impact...even if it was PURELY psychological, in giving people the idea that there was huge volume and that they needed to get in on the feeding frenzy. It's why the Chinese exchanges fake their volume.
Mt. Gox was the go-to exchange mentioned in every single news broadcast, every price quote on every ticker. I still say they were the market maker, in 2013.

Regardless, you think any of this means that the bubble of 2013 and the conditions that created it is something that's likely to repeat, because of someone showing a chart that "kinda sorta" looks like the one pre-bubble? Even if you don't think Willy and Mt. Gox were catalysts, and you lay the blame entirely at China's feet, tell me how anyone should reasonably expect another bubble like that one to happen, today?
@_date: 2016-04-18 07:34:56
So then tell me what the incentive is for someone to get a crypto loan rather than a dollar loan?
People have been harping on micropayments as "the future" for Bitcoin/crypto for years now...but nothing has materialized, in years. I just don't see these big catalysts for another parabolic move, anywhere. I see the potential for organic growth, sure...but I don't see "a return of the 2013 bubble" and I certainly don't think scaling charts to show similar patterns is the divine sign of an impending bubble. People have been posting those chart patterns for 2 1/2 years, without success.
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:16:12
Mt. Gox and Willie, along with an epic bubble chase due to media attention. Bitcoin is "old news" in the media now and I don't think there's anything that would cause a parabolic move up, at this point. Nor should people want one, if they really want Bitcoin to work as a currency. Stability is what people want in a currency. But probably 60% of the people on this sub (or holding Bitcoin) don't really seem to care if it becomes a usable currency, what they care about is whether it will make them rich or not, and how soon.

Yes, it's an average. I also know that the hashrate in the Bitcoin is increasingly constantly and hasn't really contracted enough to lengthen the 10 minute block time significantly. It's very easy to track the number of blocks that are found between when you initiate a transaction and when it actually finds its way into a block.
It's a known fact that many large miners are excluding transactions in order to gain an edge on other miners. When transactions are excluded, all of those people wait until the next block, which is hopefully found by a miner that DOESN'T exclude their transaction.
Fees do not represent a large enough incentive for many miners to include transactions for the fee income.
I know how Bitcoin works. You're just choosing to ignore the facts.

I'd be prepared for it to start going higher (and AUR crashing) as all of the value currently being held in AUR is transferred into Bitcoin. There's no way anyone who knows anything about cryptocurrency will hold AUR instead of BTC. Anyone who gets "free money" like this is going to want to convert it into something they can use. You can't use AUR anywhere, at all...it's merely going to be a transfer mechanism for value and a fair chunk of that value is going to move into Bitcoin (and fiat).
Basically, the world is about to give Iceland a stimulus package. It's a tax on peoples' gullibility. At least the transfer of value out of AUR will be slow, because that coin is slow and broken as hell, thanks to the multipools.

You'd type "bei jing" and the entry method translates that to 北京 (actually in the absence of a tone indicator of 1-4 it'll give you options for which character you're asking for or guess at a well-known phrase, since there are also four tones involved). They do make "bi hua" keyboards that have stroke shapes on the keys but that's pretty cumbersome, so it's rare that anyone uses it.

The last time China did this, it was the exact same message...banks and payment processors were being disallowed from working with bitcoin exchanges, which was to be effective as of Chinese New Year. New Year's came and went, and people were still able to get renminbi into and out of the exchanges.

As Bitcoin continues to increase in value as it gets more widely adopted, those merchants and businesses who are currently converting to fiat are, more and more, going to feel like they need to be staying in Bitcoin. Eventually, over time, the loop will close and nobody will want to convert back to fiat, until it's time to pay taxes or bills that can't be paid in Bitcoin.
Accepting it as payment and converting to fiat is a stopgap solution, until the time comes that it is so widespread that there's no longer a reason to do so.

Knowing about it is different than adopting and using it. There's been AMPLE media coverage for people to at least be aware of it. That does not translate into adoption. Clearly...because if it did, the price would be in the stratosphere as demand would far outstrip supply. Instead, price continues to contract.
Your inner circle is not an accurate sampling of the rate of adoption. Take a poll of your neighborhood. As local merchants about it. I think you'll find it's as far off most peoples' radars as it could possibly be, right now.
Simply take a look at the number of wallet downloads there have been. Then remember that of those, a huge number are people upgrading their wallets from older versions. I'd be shocked if there were 100 million wallets in use, worldwide...and of those, less than half would actively use them. There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 billion people on this planet. So...yeah.

Of course (hence the "if" in my post).. But all chart analysis is, is recognition of patterns. It's just that with Bitcoin, those patterns usually become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because the market is run by traders and bots who are both slaves to charts and technical indicators. The current uptrend is due to technicals and a pattern that has occurred numerous times in Bitcoin is forming again. It would be foolhardy not to acknowledge it.

I don't think it's manipulation, but I do think that people are completely ignoring the looming tax deadline in the US and the recent IRS capital gains rules. A lot of Stateside investors are probably taking this opportunity to realize enough losses that they can avoid paying capital gains taxes. That'd contribute to the decline, significantly. China has been steadily bleeding Bitcoin ever since the "Chinese New Year" ban talk...and to hear Bobby Lee tell it, trading has slowed to a crawl and the "average Joe" is sitting on the sidelines now. I don't think China is 100% to blame for this latest decline. If this theory is right, then after the tax deadline we should see a lot of investors piling back in.

The wording of these "innocent" little memos by the government are carefully crafted. For the same reason they use terms like "weapons of mass destruction" or "assault rifle" to stir up emotion, they mention Bitcoin right alongside terrorism, money laundering and crime. Strangely, they don't do this with the US dollar...even though it is RIFE with criminal activity, laundering and terrorism. But yes, we definitely need to target this new crypto that the government shills claim is insignificant in relation to the dollar.

Mt. Gox wouldn't be required to convert into fiat to pay back users, they have records of peoples' balances at the time trading was halted. I don't think Mt. Gox is to blame, here.
However, it wouldn't surprise me at all if there were "whales" out there attempting to keep the price artificially depressed, to give large/institutional investors time to buy in large amounts through off-exchange transactions at the lower price. The REAL whales don't do their buying and selling via transactions, because the volume just isn't there to support it. But those buys and sells do probably end up being conducted at whatever the market value is determined to be at the time.

This is one of the major reasons I support Litecoin just as much as I do Bitcoin. I think an alternative network will be very valuable for many reasons, but I just don't like that there is someone out there with a "kill switch" cache of money, which could be used to collapse his "experiment" someday. Satoshi is a secretive guy who developed this for philosophical reasons. If it starts moving in a direction he doesn't like, he can have a pretty serious impact on it by dumping his stash (see Ripple).

Unless you are going to be a day trader or short-term trader, ignore 1BTC. If you don't have expertise at reading charts or experience with how the day trader market reacts to Bitcoin, you'll stand as much chance of selling right at the bottom and watching the price go up as you scramble to buy back in higher.
If you don't want to dedicate yourself to becoming a trader, buy and hold. Long-term, Bitcoin's chances of widespread adoption are excellent and that being the case, demand will outstrip supply and the value of the coin you hold is going to go up over the years.
Buy and hold.

Some selfish miners solve blocks and don't put any transactions in them. They find the fees to be a negligible increase in income, so they don't much care about the transactions...they care about the speed with which their block is reported and verified by the network. IMO whether or not to put transactions into a mined block should not be optional, or in any way circumvented.

Litecoin is experiencing some growing pains that will probably last through summer. Right now, a small subsection of miners control a larger than normal slice of the network hashrate (and therefore, a larger amount of the newly-mined coin). The result, as they sell off what they mine in a mad dash toward return on investment, is downward pressure on the price relative to Bitcoin. It hasn't lost any value compared to the dollar (actually, it has gained some) but until the network hashrate redistributed to something approximating what it was before ASICS, we will see these handful of high bashers having a larger than normal impact.
It's also due to the longstanding tradition of people migrating from Litecoin to Bitcoin during upswings in Bitcoin's price. Traditionally, at the end of an extended upswing you see money come back into Litecoin and the ratio to Bitcoin goes back up.
Right now, I am waiting for that slingshot effect to show up on the charts and will move more from Bitcoin to Litecoin.
Thing to remember is, Litecoin is about a year and a half behind Bitcoin. It is going through now what Bitcoin went through in early 2013. These large scale ASICS will lend the network a ton of legitimacy and security, which will attract develipment, investment and business.
It's the only alt I have ever really cared about.

Good post, but here's the problem...the choke point is the banks. We rely on banks to facilitate the movement of our fiat money into and out of digital currencies like Bitcoin/Litecoin. In the absence of the banks, we have to take our paper money to a rare Bitcoin ATM, or find a person to do a transaction in person with. Since the a huge number of people in developing nations are unbanked (and even in developed nations, for that matter), there need to be very easy, reliable services for them to exchange their fiat money for digital currencies...the same way they would at any foreign currency exchange.
Right now, ask anyone how to buy Bitcoin, and they'd say "Well, sign up at an exchange and then do a bank transfer, etc..."
There is also an extreme ease of use challenge. It simply isn't dummy-proof...at all, in any way. In fact, I've seen SMART people, early adopters, screw up and lose their money due to sending it to a wrong address, or have their wallet compromised somehow. The software has to get much, much, much better.
Of course, I believe it will...but the growth curve is subject to finding a way of appealing to the "early majority" and getting us out of the "early adopter" phase. It's not predestined.

No, not "everything" is decentralizable - such as payment processing. I am saying that you don't just open the doors and say, "Come in and fill in all the holes for us." Because when they do that in a centralized way, then the ONLY thing that is decentralized is the way the network is constructed and all transactions are middle manned. I don't think anyone at all should be eager to see that happen because if it does, we just completely squandered a potential paradigm shift with status quo thinking.

A lot of the time, charting works like a charm. When I noticed that Bitcoin was about to break the trendline, even though it was trading sideways, I switched to "accumulate" mode. Sure enough, a week after that we saw the pop in price. Traders and investors actually follow the charts, so the charts are a self-fulfilling prophecy with crypto trading. But they are heavily influenced by sentiment...there's been so much good news with very little bad news and China's largely been taken out of the equation. So happy times are making a comeback.
But yeah, reading the charts doesn't save you from the latest story coming out of Xinhua about what the PBOC is doing to thwart Bitcoin and assert its capital controls. Sentiment can turn on a dime and render all your fine chart theory completely pointless.

When you can go into 7-11 and pay for a Slurpee with Bitcoin, that'll be when it's so mainstream that it might reach those heights, because that 98 billion dollars a year that's currently going into prepaid debit cards may start migrating to Bitcoin, when they realize they don't have to pay all of the ridiculous fees associated with using the prepaid cards.

In a three month span, they lost half of those residents when their leases ran out and couldn't continue doing business, had to sell...at a substantial loss.
Real estate people all think the same way...and it's NOT as easy or as guaranteed as you make it sound. The chances of losing money - and a LOT of it - are just as high (maybe higher) as they are with Bitcoin.

This is ridiculous. It's on the level of saying that checks and cash are the same thing, to me.
I have experienced, over and over, the long delays in waiting for Bitcoin confirmations. It's not a myth, it's a fact. I have waited upwards of 30 minutes for just one confirmation, as miners put empty blocks into the blockchain and I was forced to wait. This is one of the major reasons that I'm as big of a Litecoin supporter as I am...it's just flat-out faster in every situation that isn't amenable to zero confirmations. And there are going to be a lot of those, as time wears on...in the same way that not everyone wants to take a personal check, because of the bank delays. If I'm doing a person to person transaction, confirmations are a must. If, for some reason, a Litecoin miner enters and empty block (it is not a practice that has apparently taken hold yet), I only have to wait 2.5 minutes for the next one. Not ten. It also provides a 4x smaller window for double-spending attempts.
I don't want to rely on some third party "trusted" service to ensure my transaction goes through. I'm not leaving it up to an intermediary...that's why I want to escape the banks. I don't need to give a third party the ability to hold my transaction hostage for additional fees, when the whole point of this technology is to free me from that.
If you haven't used both, you don't know what I'm talking about...but the difference is abundantly clear to anyone who has. I'm not running down Bitcoin here, I'm just saying that it's erroneous to proclaim that it's not really a benefit. It absolutely is.

Basically you are asking for new banks to come into the Bitcoin ecosystem and solve this problem, though. It's inviting the same middleman issue that fiat has. "Sure...we'll handle that for you, for a fee." We have already apparently embraced that philosophy, as the bankers seem to be flooding into this ecosystem, looking to attach themselves to as many veins as possible.
Payment processors we needed. It's a stopgap measure to enable merchants to start taking payment this way with minimal exposure to volatility. What we don't need is to invite parasites into the ecosystem to remove the trustless and decentralized bullet points from this system, because otherwise all we've done is replace the antiquated ACH transfer system for the banks to continue their abuses with...which was not the spirit in which this protocol was designed.
The more you invite "trusted third parties" into this ecosystem, the further away you drift from the spirit in which it was designed and the more you ensure that innovation will never solve the problem, because "trusted third parties" did it for us (for a fee, of course). That will only breed complacency and it's what got us into the mess we're in, in the first place.

I don't think buying altcoins is "diversification" considering they are all tied to the success or failure of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin fails, none of the altcoins will rise to take it's place...it'll lead to a catastrophic loss of confidence in the entire concept, among the general public.
The only altcoin that anyone should reasonably hold is Litecoin, because of the head of steam it has. It has firmly established itself as  and once that perception is established, it's really hard to change. Plus it can potentially add something of value to the ecosystem, as it is a separate network and the confirmations are faster.
Third would be Dogecoin and that coin is a joke.
And then the next category is "everything else."
If you are going to diversify, I'd suggest stocks...except that the stock market is every bit as hard to predict as Bitcoin, if not harder.

I disagree that it's "by design" that miners can choose not to put any transactions at all into a mined block. They do it for a competitive edge. Meanwhile, those transactions just continue backing up for another 10 minutes (or more), until someone actually DOES write them into a block...and until those transactions are entered into a block, they cannot get even a single confirmation. So your transaction could be sitting there, never hitting the network for quite a while, before it ever sees a single confirmation. If it isn't seen by the network, then that merchant you just paid will be left wondering whether he'll see his money. It's a bad thing.
I am quite aware of how Bitcoin works. Or sometimes, doesn't.

With Bitcoin, even a small increase in the value of the money in your savings can eat away at the cost of things you've previously purchased with your money. People think about this completely the wrong way, due to conditioning.
If I have $100 worth of Bitcoin and I spend $10 worth...I now have $90 worth of Bitcoin. That remaining $90 continues to gain value until it's back to $100 again. I've now effectively suffered NO loss of wealth, due to the $10 I spent...or, I basically got that $10 item for free.
Some people choose to think of it as, "Oh no, I effectively spent $20 on that item instead of $10." I disagree with that thinking. Besides, if it's critical to you that you not lose potential gains, then you establish a practice of immediately replacing any Bitcoin you've spent by buying it, thereby not losing any.
Once we reach a point where price increases are not due to the adoption curve, but instead due to the natural deflationary nature of the currency (which won't happen for quite some time), the changes are going to be gradual enough that it won't affect people. MOST people are blissfully unaware of how much value is being leeched from their money every year/decade by central banking...if they were aware of it, I venture to say it wouldn't take Bitcoin so long to take hold. The problem is, there are people with "traditional" economic education that continue to sell the lie that we WANT inflation, because it's better for a debt-heavy economy, or because in its absence, people would somehow not consume. I think that's bullshit, frankly. People buy because they want things, they aren't going to simply hoard money because it gains value all the time and we've already seen that, with Bitcoin. People spend it.

As it is, a cashier often has to slide my credit card 4-5 times to get it to read, I have to sign a receipt or type in my PIN, then we wait for the network to respond and print a receipt... the entire process can take a minute. Or I could type in an amount, scan a QR code and go on my merry way in about 10 seconds.
As for reversals...stop thinking about Bitcoin as a credit card. It's cash and the same as it is with cash, if you need to reverse a transaction, you're dependent on making your case with the merchant.

Because if, as people expect, it creates a closed ecosystem of Bitcoin commerce on campus, it's entirely possible that it will be Bitcoin and not USD that  becomes the "coin of the realm" on campus. When those students leave college, they will be demanding a world where their currency is accepted everywhere...and will work to create that world.

Laughable, man. My salary gets inflation adjusted? No...no, it doesn't. First of all, the Fed has no clue how much USD is in circulation right now. So it has no idea the exact impact printing more will have on inflation...nor do I believe it really cares, frankly. It's a lie sold to everyone to maintain trust in the currency (and to tax them silently). Second of all, not everyone works in a company that is able to offer raises every year and in many cases, even merit/cost of living increases don't keep up with the inflation from the intervening year(s). I have actually been LOSING ground to inflation over the past 5-6 years, personally.
Can you invest? Yes...and if you're lucky, your IRA or 401k will end up with a 5-8% gain over your working life. That will not keep up with inflation. Then there's the Social Security that you paid your entire life, which today's young adults will be fortunate to see ANY money from. I won't even see as much as I was SUPPOSED to, when I retire. Estimates say that I'm going to need to retire with multiple millions of dollars to live in my family's currently very modest lifestyle. I have virtually no shot at doing so, as things stand right now.

Additional features, at this point, are just "icing." The core functionality of any digital currency is there, in Bitcoin. There didn't need to be a "better" hypertext transfer protocol, the core functionality was what it was and they built on that. There are hundreds of alt-coins out there, all doing basically the same thing Bitcoin does...all slight variations on the core protocol. Litecoin is where it is because it was in the right place at the right time, with the right developers. It offers the added feature of speed and the option of a second network/blockchain, but that's it. I'm a Litecoin supporter, as well. But I don't think the rest are necessary or even particularly desirable, by anyone but miners with hardware to run. Long term, I don't think they survive. When the mainstream adopts Bitcoin and possibly Litecoin, the decision will be made and it will be spectacularly difficult for another coin to succeed.
As you said, about the only way another coin "steps up" and surpasses Bitcoin is if some catastrophic failure happens in Bitcoin as a protocol, which cannot be fixed. I don't really see that happening, there are too many extremely talented programming minds out there working on it...and besides, my feeling is that if people lose confidence in the technological underpinnings of Bitcoin due to a bug of that significance, that confidence isn't going to transfer into another coin. Trust in the technology will have been lost.

I just don't think the buying pressure of replenishment would match the huge amount of immediate selling pressure, if Amazon started dealing in a significant amount of Bitcoin and were instantly cashing it out into fiat (undoubtedly they would).

Bitcoin isn't just a currency. All you apparently know about it is what you've read in the financial rags, which only seem interested in price movement and what economists have to say...and economists can't even agree on how our current system should work, or whether it's even broken to begin with.
Warren Buffett's investing strategy is quite well known: Avoid tech. So forgive me if I don't give a shit what he thinks about Bitcoin, because he doesn't understand it...and admits as much.
People have been wrongly dismissing technological innovations my entire forty-plus years. I'm not surprised you are. But then again, there are a lot of people today saying, "I wish I had the foresight Bill Gates had," or "I wish I could be in the right place at the right time the way those guys were." But when those opportunities come along, they dismiss them. That's why a few people end up being considered "visionaries" and other people just end up working for them.

People have discounted and downplayed every piece of formative technology ever introduced, because it never goes before the public in its final, perfected form. The early adopters always put up with clunky implementation and counter-intuitive design created by engineers...until the actual human interface design minds get involved.

Long periods of low volume, then Bitcoin dumped by the thousands in a span of less than 10 minutes across multiple exchanges simultaneously, repeatedly over the last 8 months I have been following the markets. Traders discussing shorting Thursdays because of the traditional dumping that happens (with about a 70% success rate). But news that ordinarily shouldn't cause a ripple ends up creating shockwaves due to a very large volume spike coordinated across multiple exchanges, and that stinks of manipulation.

China's working on getting up to speed, but they're still barely out of third world status. Drive down the side streets of Shanghai and nestled amongst all of those flashy high-rises are the most dilapidated old buildings you'll ever see. Step off the plane in Beijing and your lungs are assaulted with the stinging byproducts of manufacturing without strict regulations. Everything in business and government is done with under-the-table and backroom deals.

We are years away from that happening. It really does parallel the early internet/web...it'll happen faster than most people imagine, though. This is the year where venture capital and software development jumped in with both feet. Two years from now, the ENTIRE landscape will have changed.

This is the most common, and most idiotic argument I see about inflation. No, not everyone gets an annual pay increase that keeps up with inflation. In fact, most don't. Why don't you go ahead and remind us all how we should counteract it via investing (itself a crap shoot that usually redistributes wealth into fewer hands), and how it's a good thing that people perceive that their money is losing its value, so they'll just freely spend it. It is patently false. But it's the most commonly used argument by the banking class who support the abuses of central banking.
No, we should all want inflation so that it'll be easier to pay down the exorbitant debt that the bankers have convinced us we should be comfortable having. The bad home loans they have sold us. The outrageous student loan debt. How convenient for the bankers, that they get to take advantage of people both coming and going. We owe them money for the bad loans, then the Fed prints value right out of our hands and into theirs.
Heaven forbid we should stop this bottomless downward spiral of debt creation by saving.

They won't be able to enforce nor audit it, except at GREAT taxpayer expense. Which is the IRS-approved exchange that I base my valuation of Bitcoin on, I wonder? Do I track the timestamp of a found block and my tiny incremental payment from the pool at the time it was generated, before it is deposited automatically at pre-set intervals into my wallet at one address? It's impossible to keep track of this stuff. How long do you think it'd take to audit me if I had to account for EVERY SINGLE PURCHASE I made, all year long?
No, I'm not saying "free money." What I'm saying is, the IRS needs to re-think how they collect...because this treatment is doomed to massive failure and waste of tax money. Not like the government cares about that, though...they've lost and wasted trillions of our tax dollars, with nobody watchdogging them and no auditing.

Choice is always a good thing. I think of it as the same as having more than one internet - instead of forcing everyone to shoehorn everything into one pipeline, it would encourage innovation for one to specialize in say, streaming media. So we might be looking at 4k streaming video by now, instead of dealing with net neutrality arguments and forcing the use of sub-optimal infrastructure.
There's more to this than the currency in question, it's about the blockchain and the things it enables. Litecoin's blockchain and protocol may enable things that Bitcoin's is not as efficient at. This is a very young technology. But I think having the option, not just in terms of currency but in terms of infrastructure, is ultimately a big positive.
I'm personally also very much in favor of the fairer launch of Litecoin and the fact that its founder is not out there in the ether somewhere, sitting on a giant hoard of coin that could conceivably be used as a "kill switch," smashing the price to oblivion and destroying all confidence in the coin. Sometimes these reclusive inventors can be pretty eccentric and so that makes me a little uncomfortable, to be honest. We know exactly who's driving the Litecoin ship with Coblee and Warren, there are no mysteries.

Market adoption and the network effect. You can't buy anything at Overstock.com, Tigerdirect, etc... with Litecoin. You can't actually buy much of anything with Litecoin directly, right now. It's probably in the works, waiting in the wings, but not yet. Investors in Litecoin are doing so because they believe it is better than Bitcoin (and IMO in many ways, it is) but that investment is being done in a forward-looking manner, with far less guarantee of success than Bitcoin. Litecoin is in competition with a litany of other alt-coins that are fighting for Bitcoin's table scraps. It's leading the way there, but it's still in Bitcoin's shadow.
The question is a lot like "Why Visa, when I can use American Express just as well?" Because not everybody takes American Express...everybody takes Visa.

It'll definitely help the public perception that Bitcoin is economically "out of reach" for them to buy into. Like it or not, we have multiple generations of people who are used to seeing value on the left side of the decimal, and chump change two decimal places to the right. Extend that out eight decimal points and now you're looking at an amount that's not worth anything, to most people. Bitcoin may not work that way, but it's asking a lot of people to completely discard everything they know about how money is denominated.
I think it's a good change and would have a good psychological impact on the mainstream.
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:36:38
There are hundreds, MOST of them don't matter, almost all are used to mine Bitcoin by proxy (selling the proceeds into Bitcoin) and to a more limited extent, Litecoin. Almost none will ever achieve mainstream acceptance. Every single one of them has a rabid following that will try their level best to convince you that they're going "to the moon" and will one day supplant Litecoin or perhaps even Bitcoin. All of those people are mining or holding tons of the coin they are trying to convince you is the best.
It's the wild west. It'll start to shake out, over the next year or two. But I wouldn't get TOO involved in altcoins, if you're interested in crypto just stick with Bitcoin and maybe Litecoin, but that's about it. And don't think short-term, because you'll lose your mind. Stick some money in it and determine to just leave it there and forget about it for five years. Come back in 2019 and see what happened to it.

In my experience watching the markets, it generally takes about 2,000 bitcoin to move the price more than $30 or so. I wouldn't expect a gigantic rise from $200,000 but if the markets are moving into an uptrend, it can potentially trigger a nice little run up. Then profit-taking, as always.

I don't believe guys like this are any more paid shills than the people who relentlessly evangelize Bitcoin anywhere they can. It's two sides of the same exact coin. One side pro-Bitcoin, the other side anti-Bitcoin. Guys like this hate on Bitcoin because there's something in their personality that compels them to do it. It doesn't even have to be backed up by actual facts, in fact it's USUALLY not...it almost always is uninformed or outright wrong information (based on the misinformation they've seen in the financial press, usually) and always seems to devolve into, "tulip bulbs" references, discussion of illegal activity, or pro-state rhetoric.

Like Edward Snowden said in his television interview...sometimes you have to break the law in order to do the right thing. I believe that when the government gets out of line, as it CLEARLY has been guilty of over the last 30 or so years (with increasing severity and regularity), the people have a responsibility to put the government in check. If they don't, that government will begin to wield far too much power and those who control it will UNDOUBTEDLY abuse it. Absolute power corrupts, as the saying goes.
Snowden gave us just a LITTLE peek at it. He's one guy, with one peek into ONE agency. People cannot be so simple as to believe that it's limited to just the NSA. Right now, they are putting policies and programs into effect to target US citizens as "domestic terrorists" and not for bombings, or ACTUAL terrorism...but for expressing a dissenting opinion.

I think it's definitely possible. The ramp-up could be seriously huge, when infrastructure is such that people can easily use it in a lot of places. We're seeing the seeds of that being planted now. Bitcoin being integrated into traditional point of sale systems, etc...
It's possible that by the end of 2015 you'll be able to spend your Bitcoin at the pump, 7-11 or the grocery store and when that day comes, the demand will grow so large that the price will go "boom."
I just remember that it really didn't seem like that long, between the launch of the Mosaic web browser and the emergence of e-tail and web-based "magazines." Maybe a couple of years. The speed with which Bitcoin is currently growing this year leads me to believe it may have the same kind of adoption curve.

NewEgg (and most retailers who are converting instantly to fiat)  will most likely never have a policy of refunding your purchase in Bitcoin - or at least, not for the foreseeable future. The reason is simple and should be obvious.
You spend one Bitcoin today at $520. Your product is shipped and arrives, but Bitcoin has gone up to $630 in the meantime. You now have buyer's remorse and want that Bitcoin back. NewEgg converted that $520 Bitcoin immediately into USD at the time you made your purchase. By asking for them to refund you in Bitcoin, you're asking them to take a $110 loss by buying Bitcoin at the current market value of $630 to refund you that way.
Want a good way to ensure that no merchant will ever want to deal in Bitcoin? That's a good policy to insist on, then.
If you're going to spend Bitcoin, you need to understand the limitations the market has right now. This is one of them. That said...I have never been impressed with NewEgg customer service, at all.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:46:25
It is. This is a limited view of "Bitcoin as a payment system" that the financial newsmedia is trying desperately to propagate...completely ignoring the multitude of uses beyond that, and the fact that the currency's supply cannot be manipulated.
To suggest that Bitcoin won't stimulate economic growth is a joke. Jobs will be created by new businesses that spring up in support of Bitcoin's infrastructure. Businesses will realize increased sales as unbanked are more able to make purchases online. There will be quite a lot of benefits to the economy...and long-term, it's a currency that can't be devalued at the whim of a central authority. So holding it will, long-term, be much safer than fiat, which literally bleeds value every year.

I'm saying that Bitcoin changes your entire mindset. You become more careful about your spending. More likely to save until you really need something. People will still buy needed items, still buy things they really want, but they won't be as likely to overextend.
Eventually, Bitcoin is going to make people see how badly they've been taken advantage of by the credit and banking industry...what a huge lie they've been sold. It took the collapse of the housing bubble for a lot of people to realize how badly they'd been scammed on their mortgage loans, and how stupid they were to overextend just to have the "American Dream." Because for some reason, they'd bought into the philosophy that you could get that dream on credit, RIGHT NOW.
Hopefully, Bitcoin can help transform our "fast food" instant gratification society somewhat...at least, in terms of finance.

I'm talking about MAINTAINING THE VALUE of my earnings, which should not be my responsibility. I have done the work. I have delivered the goods or services and the payment that represents the value of those goods and services should not be subject to constant, steady devaluation due to a constant, steady increase in the supply, transferring more value to the banking system and stealing value from me...and NOBODY should be okay with that.

No discussion at all about the transition to ASIC Litecoin is dealing with, that now sees a handful of miners with an abnormally gigantic slice of the block rewards, creating selling pressure. The top two miners on Coinotron have over 6 TH/s and five solo miners represent over 30% of the block payouts. But an increase in nethash of over 300% since January and a lot more to come over summer/fall...the network is strengthening. That hashrate will distribute as the ASIC hardware distributes.
There are factors weighing on price that have nothing to do with market sentiment. I know a lot of people here are eager to etch a tombstone, but don't get carried away.

I'd have been moving this Bitcoin into exchanges in smaller amounts and back out to new addresses in a different wallet (I'd actually have bought a bunch of Litecoin with them, while I was at it), every day since the day I bought them...so that nosy people couldn't track their movement, anymore.

You are talking to someone who is of the mindset that there should be only one successful digital currency and who is hoping to ensure that Bitcoin will be that one, by discouraging the adoption and use of any others. The reason is simple - he thinks that's what will make Bitcoin price appreciate. However, this ignores the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto (the creator of Bitcoin who nobody knows) is sitting on 5% of the lifetime supply of the currency, which he mined in its earliest days. It is the least intelligent path anyone could take, to encourage Bitcoin to be the only option anyone has in digital currency.
Right now, if you go with Bitpay or Coinbase, you will ONLY be able to take Bitcoin. So if you want to take advantage of their 0% fees (which won't last) I'd integrate both into your cart software and use Bitpay for Bitcoin, and GoCoin for the other two.

The ledger doesn't really tell you anything about whose wallet a transaction originated with, whose it ended with, or anything of that nature. Because of the ease of mixing and anonymizing using CoinJoin and things of that nature, or simply by moving coin to an exchange, converting it and then moving it from there, it'll be virtually impossible to track those who want to avoid paying taxes.
The IRS doesn't go around checking out peoples' homes &amp; assets and then digging into their finances to make sure they jive. Every multi-millionaire in this country evades taxes, through a wide variety of methods. I'm just saying that crypto-currency makes it easier than ever.
Of course if our government were smart enough and forward thinking enough to implement the FairTax and abolish the IRS, this would no longer be an issue at all and we could rid ourselves of one of the biggest abuses of power in the country's history.

Yes, because Bitcoin hasn't had a driver yet. The Silk Road was the first "proof of concept" for it and that, for good or ill, was what launched it into the public's perception. Look at the difference today, as compared to early 2013. You see articles about Bitcoin almost daily, on mainstream publications. Videos about it. Documentaries. That change alone has happened in the space of about 6-8 months.
The hypertext transfer protocol came at a perfect time, just as high-speed internet was being innovated...and so the web provided an open, unmoderated alternative to the closed, BBS-style "services" we'd been using before...and there were not a multitude of fees associated with it, unlike services like AOL and Compuserve, who would charge you by the minute to use a chat room, or download files.

The free market will sort it out, not bankers looking to find ways to con people.

There has been, since late April, somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 million in dedicated ASIC hardware deployed onto the network. It has grown around 650% in hashrate since the end of February (the Gridseed launch). The network is exploding in strength. It has also now officially eclipsed all other Scrypt coins in mining profitability over a 14-day period, for the first time since late 2013.
There are also new initiatives underway within the Litecoin Association to create more effective branding, marketing and outreach. More merchants are starting to take a closer look at support for Litecoin via GoCoin. As the network expands throughout the remainder of the year and into 2015, I expect there will be quite a lot of activity surrounding it.

The reason they ask that question is that they feel the need to pigeonhole it. If it doesn't fit an existing definition, they have the same reaction the older guy on the broadcast had, "When is this trainwreck going to end?!" Because they just stare at price charts and think THAT'S what Bitcoin is. An exchange rate.
They don't have any concept of the uses of the blockchain beyond a record of money transfers. They don't understand the significance or the flexibility of the protocol. So they ask the question, "What is it?" Because they really don't know. It's not a hypothetical.
And that's why they bring nothing valuable to the conversation, other than to point out to everyone within the Bitcoin community just how far we have to go, before the mainstream "gets it." It's going to have to get to the point where Bitcoin is basically like electricity - we know it works, most of us don't know scientifically HOW or WHY it works, but we just understand that it does and that's all that we care about. That's the point that the internet and the web is at, now...people don't care how it works, they just know that it does and they use it daily as a result.

He's very forward-thinking and that is why he likes altcoins (he hasn't always). The fact is, if today we had more than one "internet" and one of them could be dedicated to streaming media applications, we wouldn't have nearly the amount of bottlenecking and issues we have today. If we have multiple blockchains, the burden of blockchain app development can be shared by more than one robust network. It's a good thing.

When the latest bad news out of China hit and only caused about a $15 drop, which recovered within a day, I think that was a big confidence boost for a lot of people...that China doesn't hold the negative sway over Bitcoin price that they once did.

I don't think the sole reason anyone evangelizes Bitcoin is profit motivation, I find that a pretty cynical viewpoint.

I don't think that people will necessarily cultivate a habit of purchasing Bitcoin immediately before or after spending it, no.

But right now...it is.

The first web browser I ever used was Lynx, which had to be compiled and run from the Unix prompt in my account at the local university computer lab. It was text-only and there were very few websites that weren't just personal pages full of links to other pages of links. I experienced the web this way for at least a year before Mosaic launched.
Mosaic came out, and it was like the colorization of television...now we had inline images. However, those inline images were almost always just used to create nicer-looking "buttons." There was a period where the most annoying HTML addition was the ability to put MIDI music inline on a web page. This was the first couple of years. It wasn't until Netscape was released (and around the same time, DSL) before the web REALLY started to take off. Before that, it was cumbersome and slow...and only enthusiasts and early adopters were interested. When DSL providers started bundling their software with a copy of Netscape, and made it easier to use, THAT is when the web started to gain traction. And then of course, when Microsoft started shipping Windows with Internet Explorer built in, that was the "killer app" so to speak. Before that, people were content to just use closed dial-up systems like Compuserve, Prodigy and AOL.
But no, it's not revisionist history...I lived through this. I remember it all too well...and I remember all the conversations I had about how huge it was going to be, only to be met with scoffs and "what's the point" questions.

When there is news that can be construed as negative, the market manipulation ALWAYS happens...and the reaction to those manipulations increases in intensity based on how high we've climbed, how fast. Short-term traders want to lock in their profits. Just wait around a week or two.
Make sure your mindset with your Bitcoin investment is long term...and when I say that, I mean a five year outlook at a minimum. This way, you won't invest any money you need in the near term. If you do that, trust me...you are going to make money and you will find it much easier to ride out these turbulent portions of Bitcoin's growing pains.

I really think the market is being manipulated in order to give certain so-called "whales" a chance to buy in off-the-books at a much lower price.

If you're a heavy investor, it doesn't take a lot of bitcoin to create a massive panic sell-off when a piece of bad news comes out of China, etc... Ride that trend to the bottom and then make your off-books buy, cheaper.

That's the lie that they're selling you, and you are buying it...which is what bothers me. Bitcoin absolutely CAN become widespread enough without people like him, just as the world wide web became huge well before Google or Amazon came on the scene. We absolutely do not NEED or WANT people like him dictating where it goes or how it's used, what the regulations are, or anything of the kind. All we need is payment processors, merchants accepting it, and to inform the public...which is happening organically, now. The free market works and we do not need banking class involvement for it to be successful. Make no mistake, they are attempting to co-opt it...and if people continue to wear blinders, they'll succeed, because they are already dug into the halls of government like an Alabama tick and are now starting to exert their influence.
For some backwards, bizarro-world reason, people seem to think that bankers getting involved lends Bitcoin legitimacy. As if they haven't been paying attention and have missed how utterly corrupt, self-serving and debased the banking system has become.

They don't keep all of the Bitcoin at the ready, to instantly move at a moment's notice. They keep 90+ percent of it in cold storage. If the volume of requests increases, they've got access all of that cold storage before they can move the coin. That can lead to delays.

It's pretty simple. I have lived through every major technical advance since the introduction if the home computer and Bitcoin has all of the hallmarks that the biggest technologies have always had. The first home computers were not all that useful to most families. They were not what they have become. The early internet and subsequently the web...also not that useful, at first. MP3, before portable players...not that useful. But if you had vision, you could clearly see the potential in all of them. I did, but all I could do is tell people who returned a quizzical look and deemed me a nerd. Rightly so, I guess. But Bitcoin allows people to actually benefit from a little foresight directly.
I see digital currency as inevitable. It's a byproduct of our entire society transitioning to doing things digitally. Let's also not forget that the web isn't remotely done evolving...it's constant. We are in this weird transitional period now, where brick and mortar is struggling to avoid being seen as a "showroom" for online purchases, bookstore chains are slowly vanishing, the recording industry is moving away from physical media, film production is now rarely done with actual film, and the focus is on delivering digitally.
The world is going to look a lot different in 30 years and Bitcoin is built for that future.

Bitcoin had been in a pretty tight consolidation for a while, prior to this drop. The market was pretty much holding its breath, waiting for either a breakout or a breakdown. Pundits were on both sides of the fence on which way it'd go. MOST traders seem to be of the opinion that we're on the last leg of the correction from the 2013 bubble, though. I think the fact that it didn't have a much worse sympathy sell-off after the initial hit says that the market doesn't really want to go a whole lot lower. Realistically, when you think about earlier this year and $100 intra-day price swings being "normal" a $25 drop only feels precipitous because we've been trading sideways for a while.

Just like when I was a kid watching the original Tron movie, having my mind blown by it and wondering if video games would EVER look that good. Now here I am an adult and video games are about 100x more detailed and realistic than that.

This is something that I think the developers really need to address. IMO, it shouldn't even be an option, whether or not you include transactions in a block you've mined. As long as they've paid the minimum fee, they should be guaranteed entry to the next available block. This problem is going to get a whole heck of a lot worse if Bitcoin reaches a mass audience, and people are sitting on their thumbs waiting hours just to have their transaction show up in a block.

The author (and Newsweek) probably think they just printed the story of the century and fired up the printing presses, believing this was going to be the article that pulled their publication from the precipice of extinction.
The fact is, it doesn't matter at all who created Bitcoin. It has new stewards, now...and they are the ones who will be taking it wherever its destiny dictates it will go. If this guy is, in fact, Satoshi - does it even matter? What was really gained from doxing him, other than perceived glory for the author and subscription income for Newsweek? Did it somehow lend more credibility to Bitcoin? Did it discredit or devalue it? It did neither. At best, it revealed a piece of pointless trivia...at worst, it robbed a US citizen of all of his privacy for the misfortune of having the same name as the internet handle of the guy who developed Bitcoin.

People claimed there was no need for personal computers when guys like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were creating the business. Thank God they didn't listen to naysayers the likes of you. There's a lot more to the Bitcoin protocol than the currency...which is why it's virtually assured of success.

That's a ridiculous objection.

So somehow, he's no longer a visionary...he just got lucky that enough people agreed with him. Or Jeff Bezos, insisting on developing the Kindle because someday, people would prefer e-readers to books. Nobody was asking any print publisher if he was right...because of course they wouldn't be objective.
Economists poo-poo Bitcoin because it doesn't fit their preconceptions, or what has come before. But the best ideas are not merely iterations on what has come before...they are brand new, and challenge the old paradigms. Then we move forward with a NEW understanding of things. That's what Bitcoin is.

You understand economics...and that is all you apply to your understanding of Bitcoin. How much do you understand about the potential uses of the blockchain? Do you understand how much value those uses add to the currency? To the network that maintains it? Apparently not.
No, what I think you understand is, Bitcoin as a currency is speculative and currently unstable due to volatility, therefore not suitable as a replacement for fiat currency. Just like every other economist I've ever read...and ignored. Because people with a classical education tend to dismiss new and disruptive technologies/innovations, because they don't "fit" what they've been told is the natural order of things. There are people who would go to their grave claiming that we NEED and WANT inflation...because that's all they've ever known, and because economists have programmed them to believe it. It won't be until something comes along and successfully challenges that belief, that they change their minds.
Peoples' beliefs in what is true and absolute have repeatedly been challenged and shattered over the last 42 years of my life...and well before that. The people who didn't understand why anyone would want to HEAR the actors talking in a movie eventually had to concede that it was better. Or colorization. Or home video. Or high definition. The list goes on and on...always with a significant number of detractors who didn't think it would succeed.
Time will tell. I'm comfortable that this is yet another technological advance where the outcome seemed obvious to me and ultimately, I was proven right. Only this time, I'm in a position to directly profit from that.

Love the anti-Litecoin misinformation on here. Some just can't stand the idea that Charles Lee might have improved on the mysterious Satoshi's creation. The data is erroneous (as has been posted on the Litecoin Reddit, and the page itself says the data is "not very" accurate.
Litecoin has made several improvements over Bitcoin which will be borne out as adoption and use spreads wider. The quicker confirmations are going to be a major advantage, the fact that the hashing algorithm wasn't developed by the NSA, and the fact that Scrypt makes terahash ASIC machines virtually impossible means the mining is more democratic. In the long run, more players will be involved. I know it's hard for advocates to admit that anyone could improve upon Bitcoin, but since the Bitcoin team has routinely gone to Charles Lee and company to "test out " ideas for the Bitcoin protocol, it's clear that there is a lot of respect there. Plus, nobody pre-mined millions of Litecoin that are unaccounted for, which could show up and collapse the currency at any time.

Mike Maloney's videos are very good and are an eye-opener for anyone who has blinders on to how the financial system really works...which is probably 80% of the population. Peoples' first reaction is usually, "This is bullshit." Then if they watch for longer than 10 minutes, it becomes..."Hrm, maybe there's something to this." Two hours later, you come away from his YouTube sub ready to burn down the Fed and our current banking system, put all of your assets into precious metals, hole up in a bunker in the mountains and wait for the global economic meltdown to happen, sitting on your pile of gold and silver bullion :)
He predicts a lot of doom and gloom about our system of fiat currency, but he's definitely not alone at all. Ron Paul has been preaching that word for decades, as have many others.

I don't see this as the death of alts.

You have obviously never been unbanked or had to resort to prepaid debit cards to make purchases, because of bad credit or just a desire not to use credit cards. They rape people with fees on prepaid cards.

The internet and world wide web have created negative repercussions on our culture as a people that were not necessarily positives. The decline of civility and general human social interaction, the rise of the "look at me" culture, with people pointing a camera at their face for a "selfie" or yammering about something nobody should care about for ten minutes, to get "views" on YouTube...and getting millions of views for it. I facepalm constantly at what has happened to us in the last twenty years. Of course, I was on the ground floor and as excited as anyone about the possibilities, most of which were awesome. But some of it was just...BAD.
That's what will come of digital currency, too. There will be a LOT of good, some of it potentially world-changing good. But it'll come with its share of bad. We just have to make sure to mitigate the bad as much as possible.

Your rant makes absolutely no good points, but you're very good at anti-Bitcoin bluster...I'll give you that. There are developers currently working on VERY good apps that use the blockchain. Smart contracts, property ownership/transfer, even this new concept of logging into sites using a Bitcoin address only you control. There are a huge number of potential applications, giving it huge upside.
You lack vision, is what I'm saying. You take the Internet for granted today, but when I was a teenager the internet wasn't even a blip on almost anyone's radar, while I was poking around on it via a telnet account at the local university. Most people questioned the point. They lacked vision, too.

I don't think that's necessarily true.

If it fails because of government crackdowns and bureaucracy, then yes...all of them fail.

In a "Bitcoin Economy" you have switched from an income tax system to a sales tax system (Fair Tax) so that there's no tax evasion, no questions of what you can and can't deduct, the rich and wealthy pay their share based on consumption and the poor pay less due to less consumption.

Institutional investors don't buy or sell large amounts of Bitcoin on the books...they do it off the exchanges, privately. At least until SecondMarket launches their trading platform (at which point, THEY will be making the market, when all of those whales come on board). So you won't see the impact reflected on Bitstamp/BTC-e etc... It's like trading invisibly.
The price is being dominated by momentum traders. They take every opportunity to turn a news story into momentum, one way or another. China has been quite reliable for that...you can see them try to do it with other news, too. They've been trying to drive it down due to the Neo &amp; Bee story, but it hasn't been working that well...basically just slumping right now, in response.

Be in both. Personally, I'm a big fan of Litecoin and I think it's going to gain a lot of ground over the remainder of 2014. In this Bitcoin sub, you will find a LOT of people who believe "there can be only one" but in my opinion, giving consumers and developers the option of a coin on a completely separate and robust network of hardware (the Litecoin network is about to become dominated by ASICs), secured by a completely different algorithm, is a desirable thing.
In my opinion, if we weren't stuck with only ONE internet, we wouldn't find ourselves in a situation where everything had to be shoehorned into one pipeline. If we had a second network that could be tailored to handling streaming media, for instance, we'd be enabling a lot of innovation and advances that aren't possible with one internet that has to serve ALL purposes.
That's my thinking, anyway. Litecoin, with its faster confirmations and more abundant coin, may end up lending itself to applications that Bitcoin doesn't...but the point is, the investment (financial and manpower-wise) is going into Litecoin's infrastructure to provide an option and I like that.

I am starting to get the feeling that an increasingly large amount of volume is being transacted off the books. I think there are "whales" that are using the exchanges to manipulate prices, and then using the manipulated prices on the major exchanges to establish the price for very large off-the-books transactions, which do not have the subsequent impact on the exchange prices that they would have, otherwise.

I agree that it's good for the "heavy hitters" to have clarity, but I personally feel that this is an incredibly clumsy treatment of Bitcoin, wherein the IRS essentially tries to shoehorn it into an ill-fitting set of existing rules, instead of creating a proper classification for a completely new financial instrument. It's as if they either A) couldn't be bothered, or B) want to make life as difficult as possible for people using Bitcoin.

It's not an opinion, dude. It's numbers. How on EARTH can you consider Bitcoin even EARLY mainstream, when you cannot spend it in ANY local shops, anywhere in your city and virtually nobody is even out there requesting that they start taking it? And then on the rare occasion that they do, nobody actually spends it with them?
Do you know what percentage of Overstock's revenue comes from Bitcoin sales? They did $1.3 Billion  in sales, in 2013. In May, they reported having done $1.6 million since they started it in March. At this point, they may have done around $5 million in Bitcoin sales, to date. That is a tiny drop in the bucket...and they're the biggest, most well-known e-tailer accepting it and actively evangelizing it.
As long as we see people posting that the bar that used to take it doesn't anymore, or that one local mom &amp; pop shop that agreed to accept it decided to stop because nobody wanted to spend it with them, you cannot with a straight face call Bitcoin mainstream.
If you think it's mainstream now, I can only conclude that the word doesn't mean what you think it means. Mainstream will be when you can walk into any merchant that takes American Express, and be secure they'll probably also take Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-13 18:22:34
The same could be said of credit cards, prepaid debit cards, banking...etc...etc...
It's almost comical, how bad Bitcoin makes everything else look.
I sold a computer on eBay and took payment via PayPal. It sold for $2,000. I ended up collecting $1750 after all the fees, between the two - PayPal alone was like $60-70, I think. 
Then I transferred my money from PayPal to my bank. My funds would be available in 3-4 business days, they said. Okay.
Funds arrive in my bank after waiting 3 days. Bank says they're putting a hold on the funds and they'll be available for withdrawl in a week.
So all told, I got to wait about two weeks thanks to the banking system and lost $250 in fees, for the privilege of selling my computer online. Then, the a-hole who bought the computer pulled out the video card, opened a claim with eBay that it wasn't "as advertised" and eBay agreed...so he sent it back, sans video card, PayPal paid him his money back without question, and I was left with a PC without its video card, a month after the transaction...and none of the fees were refunded. So when it's all said and done, I'm in the hole about $400 and swear off using eBay and PayPal, forever.
If I'd sold the computer to someone outside the system, using Bitcoin...I'd have paid about a buck in the transaction fee, and would have had my money (all of it) within half an hour or so...with no broken/corrupt system to abuse in order to take advantage of me.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:22:00
That's exactly right. The IRS told investors that they'd be taxed on capital gains. China news creates a sell-off prior to the deadline. Investors go, "Hey, cool...I can now realize just enough of a loss that I'm not taxed on capital gains, FU IRS." So you've got people taking a loss just to avoid the taxes, and people cashing out to pay them.
Then after the tax deadline (and after China's deadline passes and people can still buy in), watch it climb as said investors pile back in.

But Apple made it mainstream. Neither the Diamond Rio nor playing music on your PC would have made it mainstream and if you think it would have, you're delusional. Apple understood design and aesthetic, and they understood human interface. They made it easy and painless.

My guess is, as many people as are able will take advantage of the giant arbitrage opportunity by moving their Gox BTC purchased super-low out to other exchanges and selling it for the best price they can get. It'll drive the prices down a bit. How much depends on how many people are able to get their BTC out, and how many of them are trying to profit this way. But I am expecting a short drop from selling.

It's not just about the behavior of traders, the markets get hit with sell-offs by payment processors and miners, too...and at times where you wouldn't necessarily expect to see selling. We just had a pennant forming on the charts, which is typically a bullish signal...and yet boom, bigtime sell-off across multiple exchanges made the pennant break down and now it looks bearish, which causes a reaction among traders whose behavior is dictated by the charts.
So it doesn't need to be bad news related to Bitcoin. All that has to happen is for some big miner or payment processor to liquidate a bunch of coins and if that changes the charts from bullish to bearish, the traders will react in kind.
Also, there is an oft-discussed factoid about Bitcoin that traders know...and that is that Thursdays are traditionally the "short" days. Almost every Thursday, like clockwork, the market drops. It's become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Nobody is surprised or upset by the fact that they need to pay taxes with regard to Bitcoin. What they're upset by is the IRS' obvious intention to destroy Bitcoin's functionality as a currency by taxing it as a commodity or stock. It's either been done purposefully, or simply out of a complete ignorance about what Bitcoin's purpose actually is. Take your pick...both are equally plausible.
It's going to have to be amended/changed, because it's untenable in its current form. People will not stop using it to transact business, and they won't claim every little transaction. So the IRS needs to refine the treatment to acknowledge that Bitcoin IS, in fact, used as a currency. Shouldn't be that hard, considering they call it a "virtual currency" in every single line of the f'n document.

Right now, Dogecoin users are perceived a little like America Online users were, when AOL opened the floodgates of their users onto the internet. They were reviled on IRC and Usenet for their weird terminology (MUCH of which is now commonplace on the internet) and the tiny little "community" of internet users was very insular and exclusionary. Now, Facebook, Yahoo and Google PM software dominates "chat" online and IRC is relegated to being for truly hardcore nerds or programmers...Usenet has given way to feedback forums online and the ENTIRE culture of the early 1990s internet has all but vanished.
This post is on the money. In one decade, these dedicated forums for discussing digital currency will be an anecdote conveyed by "old timers" who participated in its rise...but it will not be a hobbyist or activist discussion, it'll just be part of daily life. Nobody will even follow its development (no more than anyone keeps up with the development of TCP/IP or the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and discusses it on forums). At best, it'll be conversations about what was built on TOP of this technology.

It's still not THAT easy.
The thing is, we hail digital currency as "the answer" for the unbanked...yet to get any, you need a bank account. That, or you have to hunt down one of the super-rare ATMs in the wild and pay the excessive fees their operators are charging...or use LocalBitcoins and hope you aren't part of a sting. No better than getting a prepaid debit card, really. Then, you can guarantee that such a person is buying it for the same reasons they'd buy a gold or silver bullion...storing value (it isn't because you want to spend it at Overstock). This year, Bitcoin doesn't look so hot as a store of value.
It has to get much, much easier to obtain...which means you have to be able to buy it easily for cash. ATM, broker, whatever it is...it has to be easy. Secondly, the client software has to be utterly and completely dummy-proof. It's too intimidating for the average user, right now. Too much technical jargon, UIs designed by engineers, long random text strings that scare new users into thinking they're going to send money to the wrong place...it's not where it needs to be, yet.
This is going to take a long time. Bitcoin may have been around for five years, but for the vast majority of people, it may as well have only been one year. This is a process that's going to take MANY years. But it'll gradually climb as we see more progress in ease of obtaining and using it, as well as merchant acceptance.
It's a long haul. Don't get impatient.

Bitcoin didn't start with a sense of fairness, the number of miners pulling Bitcoin at the start was extremely small and those guys (including the originator) are sitting on mountains of Bitcoin right now that could potentially move the market.
Fair is how Charles Lee started Litecoin. Pre-announced the date of the genesis block, got the software into peoples' hands ahead of time, mined JUST the genesis block and then it was off to the races, with a much broader miner base to begin with. Litecoin doesn't have any big surprise original miners with mountains of coin to potentially dump on the market.

Yes, actually the more frequent blocks mean transactions get entered more frequently and that can definitely be a positive, for blockchain applications. It's not just about you making a purchase or moving money around. It's about apps built on the blockchain, too...and the faster confirmations can potentially lend itself better to some applications.
It's also a positive to have a robust second option. If today we were not saddled with one internet that everything had to share and instead had a second one that could specialize in streaming media, for instance, it would enable more innovation.
Options are a good thing. Litecoin doesn't need to be radically different, it just needs to be widely supported with a robust infrastructure.
As for the whining about ASIC resistance...it still is. It'll never have hardware that's as efficient as Bitcoin. The point was always not to compete with Bitcoin for miners and it accomplished that.

So...you haven't encountered any people who tell you they thought that Bitcoin already failed and its CEO was put in jail...and isn't it only used for black market/illegal goods and money laundering, anyway? Because I have. You give the average person way, way too much credit. They don't research.
This would be why the majority of people you encounter couldn't tell you what quantitative easing is, what causes inflation, or why the prices for things are 4x higher today than they were 20 years ago. They'd rather just impotently complain to the cashier who's taking their money.

However I have heard people say, "I bought Bitcoin at $x, it lost 50% of its value since then, it sucks and I'm out." That's the main problem it faces...the bears are speaking louder than the bulls. Not on reddit, but where it matters - on the exchanges.

It isn't the Chinese government...it's the Chinese people, themselves. They account for a GIGANTIC slice of the daily trade volume in Bitcoin and Litecoin, which is why any Chinese news creates a landslide. In general, non-communist countries are not worried about Bitcoin, which is what prevents it from tanking to $1. All of these moves based on Chinese news are coming from a) Chinese people and b) weak hands.
The whales are the ones who trigger big drops (and big rises) based on news.

My opinion: It makes total sense for Amazon not to take Bitcoin yet. The infrastructure isn't mature yet, they don't know if Bitcoin can scale to their volume level and thus far, there's not significant demand for it.
I don't really know why people are targeting Amazon right now. We need to have a lot more development in off-blockchain transaction handling, commerce side-chains with large blocks and rapid confirmations, or some other innovation that will enable Bitcoin to support the volume of transactions that a credit card network like Visa handles.
Right now, we've got major miners that don't even include transactions in their blocks. The network has a long way to go...it's just not ready for Amazon.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:22:05
Mainly because over the last 6 months or so, volume on the major exchanges has seemed to be decreasing and the amounts that are being traded are generally below 1 BTC. As a result, anyone dropping 1,000 Bitcoin on the market can have a gigantic impact on price, especially in the wake of "bad news." It's a recurring trend...a big piece of bad news (China, mainly) hits, and suddenly you see a GIGANTIC leap in trading volume, spurred by a huge sell-off of 1,000+ Bitcoin...whereas before that, only trades of sub-1BTC amounts were happening. The market eventually recovers, propped up - you guessed it - by an order for 1,000BTC or so. But after the drop, you are not seeing institutional investor-level volume in buying. It's mostly just those little sub-1BTC amounts, with the occasional double-digit buy. There's usually just one or two buyers/sellers responsible for sparking the move with a huge sell or buy.
Plus, it just makes sense to me. The value of Bitcoin is determined by what the exchanges say it is, right now. If you want to buy 10,000 Bitcoin, you're not going to go to Bitstamp or BTC-e, where people are only trading .05 to .50 Bitcoin per ask, to do it. You'll buy off-the-books...but if you want to buy lower, you wait for a piece of bad news to hit, dump a very small portion of your holdings onto Bitstamp (say 1,000BTC) and watch it plummet as panic sets in. When it hits a low you want to buy at, make your purchase off-the-books. Then, if you're benevolent, buy back 1,000 off the exchange you dumped on (realizing a profit in doing so) to spark a rally.
I just know that there's such a concentration of Bitcoin wealth at the top that something like this would be child's play. The amount of bitcoin being traded on exchanges is chicken scratch compared to what's held privately.

This is an excellent post. People tend to believe because these markets are unregulated, every significant move is a manipulation. They also don't consider the behavior of miners, who often don't pay any attention whatsoever to the market conditions, what the charts are saying and how they will impact the day traders and bots.

Yes I absolutely understand that inflation of the currency, "the time value of money" means that $12 today is worth $4 or so back in 1989. That's my whole goddamn point. If I saved that $4 back in 1989 in a zero interest account, pulled it today, I'd have...$4. Not $12. So I've lost 2/3rds of my value, thanks to the Fed.
If I save $100 today in a savings account and pull it out in 20 years, I'll have $100 plus whatever pitiful interest rate it accrued. The purchasing power of that $100 will have dropped radically in the intervening years and it'd take maybe $200 or so to match the purchasing power it had when I first put it in the savings account...thanks to that steady inflation you love so much.

No. I aspire to a government that doesn't engage in gross abuses of their power and the authority vested in them by their country's people. We are taxed so much because the Pentagon has over 8 trillion dollars in spending that they can't account for, because there's no internal audit...and they are far from the only ones "losing" or not being able to account for the whereabouts of our tax money. The IRS has been demonstrated to engage in targeted auditing of particular political affiliations. The Fed taxes all of us silently by inflating the money supply, leeching value from the dollars that represent our work, and putting it into the hands of the "too big to fail" banking class, who then line their own pockets with it...and we are expected to give our money to that very same banking class, so that we can attempt to counteract inflation in doing so.

Don't confuse the PRC with the PBOC. "China" has not banned Bitcoin. They have said people are free to trade it, they just won't acknowledge it as a currency. The People's Bank Of China has "instructed" all banks and payment processors to stop offering clearing services to the exchanges. Why? Because their capital controls are threatened by it.
But if the exchanges can find alternative ways for people to get money into them (and they will), Bitcoin will continue to be traded in China.
One of these days, China will have to come to grips with the fact that its people have ALWAYS found ways to get money out of the country and they always will. Capital controls are an illusion.

A lot of things have to happen before it can be adopted by Amazon, let alone on a global scale for payments.

And to me, your skepticism is far sillier than my certainty...just as it was when people mocked me for saying that MP3 would kill CDs (but I like holding a disc and looking at liner notes!) and that the web would inevitably eliminate printed media and harm brick &amp; mortar (but I like touching things and seeing them before I buy!).

If it's merged-mined with Litecoin, then they're fine to use Scrypt and have a powerful backbone in dedicated hardware, built-in. That's a lot better than trying to convince hashrate to split off from other altcoins to mine it for them...and a lot more reliable. Of course, they need to provide an incentive for pools to incorporate it and miners to support it. I'm not convinced that Ether will be worth much to a miner, personally.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:31:18
If Bitcoin doesn't gain sufficient traction to be widely adopted, none of the alt-coins (which are almost all based on Bitcoin's core code) will, either. Look at it like Minidisc. There wasn't a "better" Minidisc that came along, which got people to adopt it. If people don't want it, they don't want it.
Bitcoin has the network effect, it has the growing infrastructure, it has venture capital interest, and it has all of these in FAR greater abundance than even Litecoin, the reigning "king" of alt-coins. If Bitcoin dies on the vine, the venture capital dries up, the infrastructure withers, the media loses interest, and the people forget about it. It's just the nature of tech adoption.

Our media is heavily influenced by the state...they just do a better job of hiding it than the Chinese. But that's not what I'm talking about.

Personally, I think what we don't need is PayPal or any other institution, insinuating itself into the picture and tacking on as much in fees as they can leech off the system. With PayPal, eBay has tried to create as closed an ecosystem as humanly possible, which they've mostly succeeded at...almost EVERYONE conducts all of their eBay transactions via PayPal, now.
It wasn't that way, in the early days. You'd accept money orders and cashier's checks, sometimes wire transfers...but there WAS no PayPal. The only buyer protection program was the feedback system, which was there to ensure that once someone got taken for a ride, nobody else would...and people with no feedback record had a much tougher time getting buyers for their items. Trust had to be earned.
People still don't need to use PayPal and if you wanted to sell something on eBay and only accept payment in crypto, you totally could...and personally, that's what I think people should be trying to move toward. Not getting PayPal to deal in Bitcoin, which only enables them to siphon more fees out of people...the very thing Bitcoin was designed to prevent.

"I have this magic thing called a debit/credit card that's way better."
98 Billion dollars in prepaid debit cards were sold in 2013, and the amount of fees that those institutions collected off the unbanked simply for the "privilege" of being able to conveniently make online and other purchases was exhorbitant. For the global unbanked alone, Bitcoin is a great solution.
But tell me...what else can be built on top of the Visa network? What new innovation does it bring to the table for computer science engineers to take advantage of? NOTHING. It offers a centralized, fee-heavy payment system and NOTHING else. Bitcoin (and other alts like Litecoin), meanwhile, offer a blockchain with a multitude of potential applications, ALL of which add value to the coin the blockchain in question is built on.

I buy Bitcoin in increments of .02 at a time over the course of 18 weeks, at various prices. I then spend .01 here and .003 there over the next several weeks. Which original purchase of Bitcoin does the IRS suggest I calculate my gain/loss from, on the spent coins? What about as a miner? Do I track every single generated transaction according to the exchange rate at the time the coins were generated, keep a record of it and then attempt to calculate gain/loss as I spend from the address that all of my mining coin is deposited into, from the pool? How's that supposed to work, exactly?
This ruling is COMPLETELY idiotic and entirely impractical. Not to mention, even if someone DOES self-report an entire year's worth of Bitcoin transactions in gain/loss format, the IRS has just given themselves a mountain of additional paperwork the likes of which they've never seen.
Instead of creating a thoughtful set of rules that applies correctly to Bitcoin, with an understanding of what it is and how it functions, they have shoehorned it into a set of rules that doesn't fit, whatsoever. Instead of making rules that discourage tax evasion, they have virtually guaranteed rampant evasion which they'll never be able to audit. The cost to taxpayers of this ruling would be astronomical, if it goes through.

China getting out of Bitcoin has already been pretty well priced-in since the "first" big ban. The exchanges have largely been faking their volume...so I really don't think it's going to go much lower. Besides, BTC China already has a voucher system planned for enabling people to get their renminbi into the exchange. They'll all come up with alternative methods that completely circumvent the banking system. Then there's BTC-e offering yuan deposits. So...it's not really over for China.
Personally, watching the trading behavior on the exchanges, I really believe the sharp price drops are the result of manipulation. Generally, the activity is in terms of fractions of Bitcoin, occasionally tens or even on rare occasion, multiple hundreds. But invariably, whenever there's a negative story out of China, there is almost always a sell order placed for 1,000-2,000 Bitcoin. People who deal in very large amounts of Bitcoin most likely do not even use exchanges...they'd make their purchases and sales privately. These large buy and sell orders that hit the exchanges are being done to manipulate the price. Why not...there are no regulations in place to prevent market manipulation.

I disagree with you completely on the point that the window on its impact is closing. Consider what the value of .00001 Bitcoin will be, in USD, when it is in continual use by millions upon millions of people, globally. How much more profound of an impact would 1 Million Bitcoin have on a marketplace where the value of a fraction of a Bitcoin is potentially valued in the hundreds of dollars? I would say the further it spreads and the greater adoption grows, the WORSE the impact becomes. People who end up putting all their eggs in that basket, believing it's safe because nobody mentioned the Satoshi Million to them, and they find their entire savings is cut in half or worse, overnight...and then in the rush to divest themselves before it gets worse, the price plummets to the ground in the worst case of hyperinflation ever? Not a good risk, especially in light of the fact that there are many PERFECTLY serviceable alternatives that work every bit as well as Bitcoin (or better), without that cloud hanging over them.

It absolutely is an analogue, because Bitcoin is still in its infancy. In 1993 if you polled 100 people, ALL OF THEM would have said they'd rather buy at the local bookstore or electronics store than order online. When people were downloading tiny, grainy MPEG videos at 320x240 over their slow internet connections, they wouldn't imagine watching a movie online. Now? Not the case.
You're thinking about how things are at this particular moment in time. None of the innovations and changes I mentioned happened overnight. Over the course of the last 20 years, PROFOUND changes have been affected by the Internet and the Web. It will be the exact same thing with Bitcoin.

Hey just what you see, pal.
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:18:58
Take a look at the distribution of wealth denominated in US dollars and you'll see pretty much the same thing. The wealth is concentrated at the top, and the "average person" holds a TINY percentage of that wealth. What can happen with Bitcoin/crypto is a shift in the 1% but there will STILL be a 1% - it's just that this time around, the 1% will be based on vision and foresight (and innovation) rather than manipulating and abusing the system to gain it. Although, there will be people like that in Bitcoin, too...and already are.
So if we live in a world where .0000001 BTC is the equivalent of $1 today, there will be those who consider themselves very wealthy holding 1BTC while those who, 30 years earlier, had the foresight to get in on the ground floor will be the world's financial elite. Those who were calling Bitcoin a ponzi scheme or tulip bulbs on internet forums 30 years earlier can bemoan their lack of foresight as they envy those who had the vision to take a risk in the early days, when things were far less certain.
Everybody's an expert, when they have the benefit of hindsight. But when Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were plowing forward with very little behind them other than belief in what they were doing and a vision of the future, nobody would have suggested that their companies would become what they have. Today, we can look at them and say, "Well it was obvious" - but back then, it was anything but. Personal computers were a luxury that not very many families owned and there weren't THAT many things you could do with them...not much that the average family would care to do, anyway. But in my lifetime, they've shaped the entire world and had a profound impact on its cultures.
If you have, like I do, the benefit of age and have lived through all of the most significant computing advances of the last 40 years, Bitcoin has a gigantic flashing neon arrow pointing at it right now, saying "THIS IS THE FUTURE." As has been the case with every single major technological advance of my lifetime, the general public will be the last to know and there will be a new generation of Gates and Jobs whose vision people will envy, in 40 years.
The move to digital currency is inevitable and Bitcoin now has a full head of steam. Right now, it feels exactly the same to me as the web did, when the Mosaic web browser launched.
As for Satoshi's bitcoin...nobody knows if he still has access to it and even if he does, he can't easily move it without being identified. Thus far, he's shown no intentions of using it and he's had ample time to cash out a sum of money that would allow him to live the rest of his life in luxury. So I'm not too worried. He created Bitcoin in order to affect change and that is what he's accomplishing...he wouldn't destroy it, after it became a success.

I think you SEVERELY under-estimate the impact 5% of the lifetime supply of Bitcoin would have on the market. Not just in terms of price, but in the subsequent loss of confidence among the public...and the longer it goes and the more widespread its use, the worse the impact would be. Every single pundit that claimed Bitcoin was nothing but a ponzi scheme would be armed with all the evidence they needed to say, "I told you so."

The difference between the vast majority of hard-core Bitcoiners and me is, I don't make any assumptions and I don't pretend to know Satoshi's motives or current intentions. Also, I don't think the guy who denied being Dorian Nakamoto was the real Satoshi, I think it was a hacker who had gotten access to that account.
Your last point is exactly what spooks me about Bitcoin and makes me very reluctant to hold any funds in it. It's volatile enough due to price discovery, I'm not willing to risk my money with the added black cloud of that million Bitcoin hanging over it.
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:12:20
I love Bitcoin (and Litecoin) because of my Libertarian politics, predominantly...but as a lifelong gadget freak and early adopter, it appeals very strongly to my tech sensibilities as well. I was one of those guys ripping his CD collection into MP3 before there were any portable players, just because I KNEW there would be portable players...it was too obvious not to happen. Bitcoin feels the same way. It just needs apps and tools that aren't designed solely by engineers, but also by human interface designers who understand how people want to work. Just as the Diamond Rio or MPMan didn't launch MP3 into the mainstream, but the iPod/iTunes did. Trezor, for instance, is the Bitcoin MPMan, to me.
That said, anything that gets us closer to abolishing the Fed and IRS, I'm 100% in support of.
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:02:47
I think there's a point at which a technology reaches enough velocity in development and support that it's pretty much unstoppable, and Bitcoin has reached that point. There's too much smart money, development and interest involved now for it to fall flat. All that has to happen is continued development of the protocol and it'll be the equivalent of the hypertext transfer protocol and TCP/IP, things we just take for granted now.

MP3 wasn't "figured out" until Apple created the iPod. Before that, the user experience for playing MP3 files was...not great. The players to that point were clumsy, cumbersome and unreliable. iPod and the iTunes store made MP3 ubiquitous.
But Apple is not the only company that is capable of doing this.
Right now, the Trezor guys are creating what I would consider the "Diamond Rio" of the Bitcoin world. Someone will come along and refine that concept, make it better for the user and more effective. A combo software/hardware wallet that syncs when you plug it into your PC, eliminates a lot of the cumbersome nature of moving Bitcoin around, etc...
People want everything to happen RIGHT NOW. These things take time. But when I look at the acceleration in the Bitcoin space that has happened in less than a year, I'm not worried.

Yes, the key word there is "currently." I agree that if your outlook is near-term, Bitcoin is a bad investment. I am invested in Bitcoin having experienced the earliest days of personal computers, the internet, world wide web, MP3 and many other formative technologies that I saw coming way before anyone in my circle of friends and family. I didn't have a good way to profit from that foresight, at the time...I was too young. I do, now.

Temporary disruption...lol. No, it would cause a COMPLETE loss of faith among the majority of people that chose to hold funds in Bitcoin, not to mention leaving them SIGNIFICANTLY poorer (or wiping them out completely). It would have a huge impact.
Satoshi can't sell off-the-books because he clearly wants to maintain his anonymity. He would find another way to move/launder the coins, first (the guy is clearly smart). The fact is, I'm not EVER going to assume to know his mind or intentions...what I know is that he has nearly 1 million Bitcoin, which is 5% of the lifetime supply of the coin, and that completely erases the concept of Bitcoin not having any risk of debasement via inflation, IMO.
I use Bitcoin with e-tailers that support it, because I want to see crypto usage spread. But I don't hold my funds in it and until I have clarity on the Satoshi issue, I never will.

And I would counter that there were something like $98 billion (with a b) worth of prepaid debit cards sold in 2013, hitting their users with fees up to wazoo...and if even half of those people chose to use Bitcoin (given that merchants start accepting it on a wider basis), you are looking at a MUCH different picture regarding Bitcoin's value and potential buyer base.
Nobody understood why I ripped my entire CD collection onto my computer, when I could only play them in Winamp and there were no portable players. I did it, I told them, because that technology would make it possible for portable players that I could load my whole collection onto. They scoffed...because no such thing existed. A year or so later, the Rio launched. Then later, the IPod. They weren't scoffing, after that...nor does anyone question the value of MP3 today. I'd be dating myself by talking about how I learned HTML by copying other peoples' source code out of Lynx and experimenting with it to make my own pages, via my telnet account at the local university.
Sure, if you look at how things are TODAY (in Bitcoin's infancy), it doesn't look so hot. It's volatile because there's not enough liquidity, not enough people want it because it can't be used in enough places. That's not going to remain the case, because the technology makes too much sense for the world we live in, today.
Yes there are a bunch of alt-coins. Only a couple of them really mean anything right now, the rest will gradually become irrelevant...especially as Scrypt ASICs become prevalent. Ultimately, the marketplace will sort all of this out by itself. It's going to come from the top down...merchants, payment processors, venture capital and businesses will dictate which coins come into widespread use and right now, Bitcoin is at the top of that heap.

He walked away from it completely to work on "other things" four years ago. I don't think he much cares. The only thing anyone can hang their hat on is the fact that he seemed to be fairly Libertarian-leaning in his opinions and was hopeful that this would become a replacement for cash. However, that said...if it ends up being "molded" by the government and regulation, to become some pale shadow of what he originally intended; what's to say he doesn't just decide to nuke it? Nobody knows him well enough to say he won't.

No. Bitcoiners are more likely to know about and ignore the Satoshi Million, because they want to get rich by holding a lot of it when it takes off and are afraid it won't if people know about its dirty little secret. "Market participants" are most likely not familiar with MOST of the politics and issues that Bitcoiners who follow its every development are. They just know market movements and trading, and think they can make money on it.
People are blithely ignoring something that is a major issue and in my opinion, that will be to their peril...and unfortunately, as the number of "market participants" who are kept ignorant of this fact continues to grow, a LOT more people stand to be hurt by a sell-off or anything of the like, which might occur on Satoshi's whim. And we'll probably never know who he is, even after he does it. That should worry everybody, but for some reason, they prefer to bury their heads in the sand or justify it away in their own minds, by pretending to know the mind of an anonymous recluse who dropped out of sight four years ago.

Banking class people are so stuck on defining Bitcoin as a currency or commodity, or both, that they cannot seem to get their heads around the fact that it's a TECHNOLOGY first. The function that backs it and makes it work is the currency  because without that, there's no incentive to provide part of the backbone as a miner. But the number of things that can be built on top of the protocol are amazing. It'll facilitate a LOT of changes in how we do things. That's its true value...and you can't define that by comparing it to fiat or precious metals, or any other commodity. That's what the financial sector doesn't get, yet. It's like saying that the World Wide Web would only ever be used for reading text published by academia, back in the early 90s. Lack of vision.
Not that all of these entities insisting that Bitcoin isn't a currency don't have a vested interest in maintaining the status, quo, right? I think they feel like if they keep pounding the message to the public that Bitcoin isn't a currency, everyone will just say, "Oh...okay," and it'll go away.

Considering that infrastructure would take the first hit in the event of a true crisis (another great depression, hyperinflation) the chances are good that the internet, power grid and other basic services would become intermittent at best and not very reliable. If people are betting (wisely) on an economic collapse - at least here in the States - they'd be better served investing in practical preparation for such a situation. Canning and drying food, a substantial amount of water (and purification methods), arming themselves, basically being ready to be completely self-sustaining without the need for money, or at least having ample supplies for barter.
People who think that crypto will save them from an economic collapse are assuming - wrongly, I think - that the internet will still be fully functional.
No, crypto is good to GRADUALLY wean society off of fiat currency and back to a more sound form of money. But it isn't good in preparation for a global economic meltdown.

I actually makes almost NO sense right now, for employees...not unless they just don't need the money. Why would you take your pay all in Bitcoin when the vast majority of your expenses are only payable in fiat? You have to convert back to fiat, which is cumbersome and in the meantime, may have lost value. Makes more sense to control your exposure to Bitcoin on your own terms, by buying when you feel the time is right.
It won't make sense to do payroll in Bitcoin until you can pay the majority of your expenses using it.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:07:20
Anyone wanting to pay for something like this in Bitcoin already knows the fluctuations the currency goes through. I would think they will do their measurements and whatnot, knowing that they can't simply reverse the transaction or get buyer's remorse and ask for their money back. Honestly, this puts more responsibility back on the buyer's shoulders, where it belongs.
State your policy on it clearly and they can decide what they want to do...but I think anyone who wants to use Bitcoin to pay for things already knows the fundamentals and isn't concerned so much with the price fluctuations.
Also...your boss should consider keeping the funds in Bitcoin. He may make a tidy profit off price increases in the long term and it's unlikely he'll be doing a ton of Bitcoin business, initially.

The software would function, yes...but Satoshi selling his stash would crater the price and the longer we wait, and the more widespread its use becomes, the bigger the crater would be. When people are spending tiny fractions of a Bitcoin at $1 each because it's in common use globally, the value of 1 million coins would be preposterous...and it would completely wipe out the order books on every exchange, everywhere. The effects would be staggering...and people minimize this out of their own greed, because they want its price to go up and they want global adoption. But this is NOT something anyone should ignore, or sweep under the rug.
Until he provably destroys all of his coins, or sells them off, or re-distributes them somehow, I won't hold my money in Bitcoin.

From my perspective, Litecoin has grown VERY rapidly over the course of 2014. Not just in terms of network hashrate thanks to ASIC hardware but in terms of services and infrastructure. Two payment processors, hundreds of merchants added, etc... Bitcoin is simply not the only game in town. Over time, people will start to see that there are valid alternatives. I, for one, will not put a dime into Bitcoin as long as Satoshi's million Bitcoin are hanging over it like a guillotine.
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:38:05
Yup...and the technology in general. The reason I cannot support or recommend Bitcoin is Satoshi's 1 million BTC hoard. Litecoin offers the very same product - better, in my experience, simply by virtue of its speed advantage (and yes, it's a real advantage right now) - without the baggage of a reclusive creator sitting on around 7% of the coin supply. Litecoin has whales, of course...but nothing like that.

And if not for Bitcoin, you never would have been able to experience what it was like to be a rock star circa 1985...but you did. Even with the losses, it's an experience not a lot of people get to have. That's awesome.
At the VERY least, people close to crypto for the past few years have gotten an education. I know I sure have. Learned more about technical analysis and market watching than I did in the five years prior, trading stocks. Learned how to be more careful about where to put my money. Started looking a lot more critically at how central banks and fractional reserve banking work, and realized how badly we are being abused. It's been very positive, even with a few financial losses.

Except that we now DO have alternative networks attempting to grow, to ensure "net neutrality." Wouldn't it have been a positive to have more than one internet back in the early 90s? Of course. One could have evolved to specialize. We might not be saddled with a network where EVERYTHING has to travel down the same pipe. Streaming media might have advanced much more rapidly and be way more robust now. Sharing the load would be a good thing.
In terms of platforms for development of software that runs on top of the blockchain, there will be benefits to having alternative networks. Sidechains are not a solution, because they still run on the exact same network of hardware and proof of work alg.
Besides, until Satoshi either relinquishes or provably destroys his 1 million coins, I'm not holding Bitcoin.

I'm mostly in Litecoin now. I have a little BTC but primarily LTC. The network has been exploding over the last 3-4 months. Since the end of February it has grown in hashrate by 650%.
The parameters of the bet aren't clear enough though, what is the measurement of "most lucrative?" Percentage of value increase from July through January 1? I would put money on Litecoin if it were clearer.
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:48:50
I have been on social media espousing the benefits of Bitcoin daily for the better part of a year. I cannot quantify the impact I have or have not had. Is the Foundation much higher profile than I am? Yes. All the more reason for their board of directors to be clean as a whistle.
The impact they've had by having to wash out people like Charlie Schrem has been quite negative, in terms of the public's perception of Bitcoin. I know that nothing I've done has had that kind of negative impact on it.
So I suppose by your logic, simply by virtue of not having their very high profile in the Bitcoin space, I should not be critical or demand better of them.
This kind of attitude, frankly, is why our government is in such a shambles.

There was a time they'd string you up for selling alcohol to people, too. Or you'd just end up being gunned down by the feds. They called it "prohibition." We don't learn from history. People are going to do to their bodies what they want to, regardless of how many sites or dealers you shut down...and this FARCICAL sentence won't stop anyone. All it's really going to do is teach people to be even smarter and more secure about how they do it. They will never stop this stuff from happening. Ever.
Ross and the Silk Road made it safer to do, for both buyer and seller. People want to smoke, we let them smoke, even though it WILL eventually kill them. Why? Because Big Tobacco has a powerful and wealthy lobby. We let people drink themselves into oblivion, and entire industries exist around the creation of alcoholic beverages (and we deal with drunk driving fatalities constantly). Yet somehow, we've drawn an arbitrary line...which is gradually getting pushed to include marijuana. Fifty years ago, that would have been unthinkable.

Right now, yes...because Bitcoin isn't held widely and is consolidated into fewer hands, the market fluctuates a lot. Over time, as it comes into circulation and is held more widely, it's going to take a lot more to move the markets. In 10 years, nobody will want to trade it on an exchange because the volatility will be so low and the movements so small, and they'll be able to exchange fiat for Bitcoin at an ATM. It'll have been made simple. It's early days, yet. I am thinking 10-20 years down the road. I want to see this proliferate and become a part of the fabric of our society to the same extent that the web and mobile phones have. I want this, so that my kids aren't saddled with a currency controlled by central bankers, who use a lack of transparency or outside auditing to print money, robbing value from the currency that they worked hard for, in order to pay the government's rising debts...which they incur due to complete fiscal mismanagement. Inflation is a tax.

This is about the only case where I could see it being reasonable...making international payments. It's a miniscule number of people, relatively speaking, but fair enough. However, it still burdens the recipient with having to take the trouble to convert it back to their local currency, take the potential hit on value, and then wait on the funds transfer from the exchange to the bank (and any fees involved with a transfer). It's not the great solution people are painting it as.

It just needs to be made completely dummy-proof and user-friendly. It's far too clunky to use, right now...too arcane. Inputs, outputs, addresses, private keys...the average person cannot be bothered with any of that. A wallet just needs to say you have this much Bitcoin, you want to spend this much, send it, and now you have this much left. That's it...nothing else.
When it reaches that point and enough everyday merchants will accept it, the benefit to the unbanked will be obvious. They can get the same benefit that they'd get from a prepaid debit card, without any of the fees.
That is, if we stop letting these third party companies insinuate themselves into every gap in the process, leeching off the system with fees of their own.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:32:21
Except that it still relies on the same network that supports Bitcoin. Litecoin has its own network supported by its own hardware, separate from Bitcoin's network (and which is about to get far stronger with ASICs). I don't see how building more coins on top of Bitcoin's blockchain negates the value of a second, completely separate network. The sidechain concept could just as easily be applied to Litecoin, as well...and now you have two separate and robust networks instead of just one, which is a good thing.

Well, you could say the world wide web was the "killer app" for the internet, because the internet existed LONG before HTML did. Even e-mail alone was not enough to push the internet mainstream, it was the web that did it. In this case, Bitcoin would be "the internet" and we're still waiting for its "world wide web" moment...the thing that makes it usable and useful to the common man. Right now, Bitcoin is like the internet before DNS.

In 1992, I was browsing a text-based world wide web with the Lynx browser via a Unix dialup account at the local university. In 1994, I was browsing the web with images for the first time using the Mosaic web browser and discovering online retailers like an early version of Amazon, which focused only on books, and several video game sellers...all orders were placed over the phone. The following year, Netscape Navigator and Yahoo came on the scene. By 1998 there were 750,000 commercial sites on the web. And then in 2001 there were so many new dotcom companies that the stock market finally rolled over and played dead.
After the stories of its early demise died down in the press, the web took about 4-5 years to become virtually ubiquitous, and today nobody can imagine what life was like before the web existed.
I would say the world wide web took about 15 years to achieve serious mainstream penetration and once it did, it exploded onto every device, everywhere, in the space of about 5-6 years.

He apparently wasn't around for the early days of the internet. That "community" was full of trolls and elitist nerds who raged against AOL when they opened the floodgates onto IRC and Usenet...when in reality, that was probably the defining moment of the internet going mainstream and becoming what it is, today.
In a couple of decades, these "communities" surrounding particular crypto-currencies, or crypto in general, will not even exist. It'll just be a thing that people use, nobody except the developers will discuss it on forums. The "community" of today is not what will shape the future of crypto...in fact, in many ways, they are like the computer lab nerds of the early 90s Internet. It would have gone nowhere, if it relied on them to push it into the mainstream. No...someone else, some company or product or service, will be the thing that moves crypto into the mainstream. It won't be these little nerdy communities that we've set up.

Someone out there is probably working on the idea that will become what I'm talking about. Maybe more than one. There are projects in the works we don't know anything about, yet.
Personally, I think it needs to be boiled all the way down to a solid state keychain "wallet" with tap-to-pay or near-field functionality and a basic screen that confirms the amount to be sent, synced with a home computer with software that manages your coin and sends it to the device. Same dynamic as pulling cash out of an ATM and putting it in your wallet.
Every new technology ends up with new minds that shape it and they come from everywhere...and generally, it's synergistic. One good idea will spawn a lot more that support/refine it. That's how we get from the MPMan to the Rio to the iPod, to MP3 now being integrated into every smartphone on the planet.

The thing is, it CAN do many things better than what currently exists...but its potential needs to be unlocked. Right now we're only seeing the baby steps toward this. We see companies like OKCoin and their "Superwallet" concept, or Bitreserve...companies trying to come up with effective ways to increase the ease with which people acquire and use it. This ease is what will ultimately make people consider using crypto. The speculators may choose to hold it as an investment, but we need interfaces for people to use it as an actual currency that eliminate every roadblock that exists.

I think in the case of proprietary hardware solutions, the marketplace will evolve to where an organization like the Bitcoin Foundation will have a committee that evaluates and gives their "seal of approval" to these devices...this would involve engineers who (under NDA) examine the source code to determine if there are any issues.
I mean, we have ATM machines everywhere...and we trust them all, implicitly. Why? How do we know that the ATM we're using isn't just stealing our card numbers and pass codes? Eventually, as this industry matures, a hardware wallet solution will be trusted if it's purchased retail, because a company going to that level of production is most likely not looking to compromise anyone's funds or lose the trust of their customers. They want to stay in business.
I'm not saying things will "magically" work out. What I'm saying is that there are smart people working on products and services and some of that brainpower should be focused on making this stuff dummy-proof, as well as secure...and the two don't have to be mutually exclusive.
Finally, the mess we are in is LARGELY due to dollars...fractional reserve banking and quantitative easing have created more debt for the US than any country in the history of the world has ever known. It is the control over money that has caused this...and that horrific stewardship of the world's current reserve currency is having ripple effects around the globe. In fact, the rest of the world is gradually moving to abandon it as the reserve and when that happens, look out...because they're all out for  and when the chickens come home to roost, they'll be roosting in the good old US of A.

It's not about what the enthusiast few (like myself) were willing to "put up with" in order to use a nascent technology. It's about what the AVERAGE JOE will put up with to do it...and the answer is (and always has been) simple: Not much. They couldn't be bothered with the internet/web when it was unformed and its clients were a pain in the ass to use, before you had DNS lookup and every URL was a number. They only started to care when high speed internet companies started bundling Netscape Navigator with their login tools...and when Windows started coming with Internet Explorer, and with the advent of "always on" internet connections, that was when it really started to take off. But the tools had to mature and they had to be EASY.

I don't think anything comes close to the level of dedication, preparation and practice that took to beat, at level 60. To get him to 1% and wipe, then convince everyone to repair and have one more go...and then watch that final 1% tick off and the hammer drop, then hear the screams of victory over Ventrilo was incredible. Then having enough points to win the bidding on the Netherwind Pants that dropped was even better. That's how I will remember WoW.

In my view, identifying Satoshi (whoever owns the early bitcoin that are parked in addresses he controls, numbering in the vicinity of 1 million Bitcoin) is less about an appeal for authority than it is a desire for security. The knowledge of who owns those Bitcoin, that we can have some sense of security that they will not suddenly dump them on the market and annihilate peoples' savings, etc...
The person who holds those private keys remaining in a completely anonymous state, with unknown intentions, creates a great deal of insecurity among a lot of people who have opted to put money behind Bitcoin and related ventures...or it SHOULD. To remove that uncertainty is, I think, a completely viable reason to "out" the person who the world identifies as Satoshi Nakamoto. If it's Craig Wright, and he proves it satisfactorily, then I think that will give a real boost to peoples' confidence in the currency.
I think you are too preoccupied with the technology aspect of Bitcoin, and spend less time considering the social aspects of it. This is a biggie, Andreas...and to have someone the community trusts, both from a moral and technological standpoint, verifying the identity of Satoshi, would have been a valuable thing. It gives him no authority that he didn't have before, it just reassures an anxious public. You may not care, but as I'm sure you can tell from the preponderance of related items in this sub right now (and the wide array of media coverage related to it), quite a significant number of people DO. So it's important to acknowledge that, for Bitcoin to grow.

Adoption =/= buy &amp; hold. That's the mindset problem that plagues crypto in general, right now. The perception among the vast majority of people, both currently involved and on the sidelines, is that this is just a speculative digital commodity. It is not perceived as a currency. When you invest in a commodity, you don't do it to turn around and spend it...you hold it in hopes of appreciation. So there's an identity problem and it's exacerbated by the fact that the tools are so primitive and the merchant uptake is so minimal, thus far. But again, my assertion is that as soon as it becomes EASY for both the customer and the merchant to use, that's what is going to grease the wheels immensely. Because right now it's cumbersome at best. Merchants need separate payment processing platforms, they have additional steps to reconcile purchase payments and it's more trouble than the small amount of customers make it worth. For customers, it just feels foreign and in some ways, scary...the wallets are designed by engineers and not by human interface designers. It's all very "Winsock/Mosaic" right now.
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:33:21
Bitcoin desperately needs near-field communications and integrated POS solutions. The current user experience - for both customer and merchant - is clunky and hacked-together feeling. This, more than anything else, is where crypto-currency needs the most development. Ease of use.

It just involves creating software that is designed for use by average human beings and not engineers. There's a reason MP3 didn't become what it did until Apple delivered the iPod and iTunes. Before that combo, portable players were buggy, clunky, poorly interfaced and with virtually no good software support. It just took a company that understood how to make it easy, to make it popular.
For instance, you could design a piece of software for the home computer that acts as an ATM of sorts, or a "vault" which is incapable of sending to any addresses that are not on a device that is synced to it via USB cable. It keeps a record of the addresses on your synced device and will ONLY send to those addresses. The user then never even needs to see the addresses or anything, it just says "Send to John Doe's mobile wallet" and an amount...click send, and boom, there it is in your companion phone wallet. The home computer vault cannot be made to send anything anywhere else, and the mobile wallet is always in your possession. Something like that.
My point is, there are software solutions and possibly hardware solutions to this problem, but the solution we SHOULDN'T be encouraging is middlemanning. That's what has gotten us into such a gigantic mess with fractional reserve banking, in the first place.

How many of those ten people are actively using it, instead of just sitting on it in the hopes that it'll appreciate in value...like 80% of the rest of the crypto "investors" in the known universe? It's one thing to convince someone to buy a little "just in case." It's quite another thing to create adoption evangelists.
Convincing people to buy a little to hold onto as a speculation isn't that hard. Convincing a merchant to accept it, on the other hand, IS...and we need evangelists for that, not passive speculators.

Depends on the dispensary but they are HIGHLY scrutinized and so none of them probably want to run the risk of laundering accusations by selling BTC on the street for cash. People saying "Bitcoin is their answer" are not familiar with the political climate surrounding this young industry and the scrutiny and limitations they endure. But I know most Bitcoiners never let facts get in the way of evangelism.

Bitcoin isn't ready for prime time yet. As long as people still have to deal with cumbersome public addresses and scan QR codes, it's not ready for the mainstream. So who are you marketing to, exactly?
This needs to be as simple as tap-to-pay with wallet software that is secure, a no-brainer method of maintaining your savings on a bulletproof and secure "bank vault" software on your home computer that acts as an ATM machine to your mobile wallet software...and you NEVER have to see a public address, if you don't want to.
The tools have to mature and get incredibly easy to use...don't put the cart before the horse. Right now, it's just not user-friendly enough.

Even if the funds are in cold storage, they should never simply "vanish" from a customer's ledger. You need to program something into the site that tells people when their funds are in cold storage and give them a notice upon attempting to withdraw them that it will take X amount of time. Don't simply pull the rug out from under them and say, "You aren't making us enough money through trade fees, so file a ticket and wait."

I think if it were do-able for them, it would have happened. There are logistical and legal challenges related to it that are not being acknowledged by the Bitcoin community. Largely, people here are not familiar with how closely scrutinized Colorado's dispensaries are right now. They are the focal point of the entire legalization movement. They all feel a very large responsibility to get it right and not do anything that draws negative attention to themselves. Right now, Bitcoin is plagued with bad press about laundering and the Silk Road/Darknet markets. They would be INVITING negative attention, by dealing in Bitcoin primarily...and they're not going to do that. I think it's a little naive of people to believe this is their answer...because it's not, right now.

People like you are what we refer to as "the choir." Fact is, people like you are already on board...and there aren't as many of you as you think. Until it's ready for the mainstream, it won't go mainstream...and until it goes mainstream, most merchants won't care about it very much, because nobody's asking for it or using it. There's a bit of a chicken and egg problem here, but it can be helped a LOT by ease of use. The only other thing that will help is to calm the volatility and eliminate peoples' exposure to large losses in the span of an hour or two, while they weren't paying attention. A bull run of the same or longer duration to the bear market we've been enduring for the last 15+ months would be a big help, though, too.
What it really needs is a niche to grow from. If just one industry started relying on it heavily, or predominantly, that would spark a lot of growth...not unlike the way in which the Silk Road sparked the phenomenon, to begin with.

Not sure this relates to Bitcoin in pretty much any way. Bitcoin isn't really an option for these dispensaries, they can't pay suppliers in it, can't pay their lease or power in it...needing to convert to fiat means they need a bank account. So it doesn't solve their problem.

Fairer in that Charlie didn't mine 5% of the entire lifetime supply virtually by himself during its first year of existence and is still sitting on it...unlike another totally anonymous and reclusive coin's creator.
But please...assure me that you know Satoshi's intentions, or that you can verify he doesn't have access to them anymore, or that he's simply far too benevolent to ever do anything like dumping a million Bitcoin for personal gain. Because that'll make it fairer.
Shitcoin? Please.

Pretty sure there are two options with accepting payment as a merchant with them - one is to have the BTC payment instantly converted to USD and deposited in your bank (for a small fee), the other is to have your BTC converted and deposited at the end of the day (no fee). I'm guessing you have not chosen to do the instant transfer.
Coinbase has a grand total of like 8 employees right now trying to service over 100,000 accounts, or something ridiculous like that. As soon as their venture funding goes through, I'd expect customer service to be very high on their list of needs to address.

Because it's 100% digital. They cracked down on the guy who was minting the Casascius coins. But they probably also know from their experience with Bittorrent that it's going to be really hard to fight crypto-currency, since it's decentralized and global. Also...they aren't communists. Also also, they hold probably the world's largest Bitcoin wallet, thanks to the Silk Road seizure.

People who are buying into Bitcoin for a quick buck because they read a story on USA Today that it was going up and people were buying Lamborghinis with it are the "shoeshiners" that they talk about in the stock market. They came in at the last minute, at the peak, and that's when the sharks mauled them. Price action right now is being moved by traders, a lot of whom have BIG bankrolls.
It won't always be so, though. They can move the market because Bitcoin isn't widely held. As more people buy and hold, and it spreads out a lot, it'll take a lot more to move the markets in a significant way.
If you're buying Bitcoin, in my opinion, it should be as much for philosophical reasons as financial. Support it because you want out of centrally-controlled currencies that have done nothing but lose most of their value in the last 100 years. People have been lulled asleep, but we're all walking up a downward-moving escalator, with fiat currency...when you retire, your "savings" will have been so devalued by the Fed that no amount of interest or stock investing will recoup the loss in purchasing power.
Buy Bitcoin because you believe in a future where governments do not control the currency and cannot affect your life negatively by manipulating it. IMO.

If you're only buying Bitcoin for short-term gain, you're investing for the wrong reasons. This is like investing in the hypertext transfer protocol after Tim Berners-Lee released it, and it was all just text-based browsing in Unix. Bitcoin/Litecoin are just now finally touching the mainstream's awareness...it'll be years before the impact is known. Not days/weeks.
Never invest money that you can't afford to lose, in anything.

Scrypt for Litecoin mining. It's the only other crypto that matters and once Mt. Gox and then Coinbase start supporting it, Litecoin should grow its own legs.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:32:41
Anyone that invests money into Bitcoin for a short term gain is in it for the wrong reasons, entirely. Consider it a bet on the world wide web gaining widespread mainstream adoption, back when you were surfing private web pages and link repositories back in 1991 using a text-based Unix browser like Lynx.
You are early. You aren't the earliest, but you're still early. You either believe in this technology's ability to create massive change, or you don't. I've seen too many things just like this come along and fundamentally change society and Bitcoin/Litecoin are just that disruptive.

A pool gives you a share of the Bitcoin reward for blocks found, based on your hashing power amongst the total hashing power of the pool. Those two Bitcoins found today get split among every miner in the pool. The fact that you are basically contributing a pocket calculator to a pool of ASIC supercomputers, you're really not going to see a return at all.
If you want to mine, you should find a Litecoin pool and do that, instead. At current prices, it's not really profitable (more profitable to just buy low) - but it may end up becoming so again, if prices go back up in the near future.

Correction: Governments serve to CONTROL the people and prevent chaos from erupting. The way various governments do that is what separates them. Communists are very uncompromising in their demand for total control over the populace and everything they do/say.

They offer two-factor authentication, so pick a strong password and then set up two factor authentication and you should be safe.  If you are worried that the United States government will suddenly become communists and seize all of the funds held by Coinbase, probably best not to keep your BTC there and instead use a local wallet on your PC/phone and just use Coinbase to print out paper wallets for offline storage.

If you didn't know about Bitcoin's volatility before investing, you didn't do your due diligence as an investor. If you invested in it for short-term gain, you did it wrong. If you sold out of panic when it was low, you realized your loss and doubly did it wrong.
Invest in Bitcoin because you believe that in 10-20 years, it will be as ubiquitous as the world wide web is, today. I wish I'd have been able to make a bet on that back in 1991, when I was first learning HTML and using the Lynx web browser in Unix, through a telnet account at my local university's computer lab. I KNEW back then that it was going to make print obsolete...but even then, I had no clue how profound its impact would be. Knowing that, we can't even imagine the ways in which Bitcoin/Litecoin will change the world.
But you need to be ready to sit on it and ride out the volatility for the next decade or more...because it's going to be bumpy.
