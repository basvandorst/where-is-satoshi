You sound like a guy afraid that there might be a bubble in crypto!
If you dismiss the possibility, you haven't been around very long.

Do they have meds for Aspergers yet?

You're an idiot.
I've been holding longer than you. Way longer.
How do I know this? Because I don't touch exchanges...ever. So I have no way to "short". This isn't even an option in my mind.
I reject the "trader" mentality, which really equates to idiots like you losing money overall.
I hold. No, I don't hodl. Hodl started in 2014, and I've been around far longer than that.
You get rich quick, wannabe "trader" kids always get your asses handed to you, sooner or later. 
You see, some of us got into this entire thing out of principles of the libertarian variety. Not to "buy lambos"....lambos that will never come for 99% of you because you're sheep. The thing is, sheep never realize they are sheep until the wolves show up.
If you think another shakeout at some point isn't going to happen, I seriously pity you.

Does this attack work on a wiped device by some chance?
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:09:10
You don't do this already?
I respect the guy that is generous even when it's not easy to be. It's easy to give it away when you're rich....not so easy when you're not.
I travel a lot. I'm in developing countries a lot. I give away money to people all the time.
Because I'm some selfless altruist? No, I'm just as selfish and concerned with self preservation as every other horrible creature we refer to as human.
No, I give money away because I really like fucking with people's minds.
Imagine you drive to work every day and you live in a country where the average wage is $150/month.
Every day you see this same person. Maybe they are alone...maybe they have kids with them. Maybe they own a food cart, or are selling something, doing something entrepreneurial. Doing more in a day work-wise than you'll probably do in 6 months.
Decent people. Not handout seekers. Just people that get up in the morning, go to work, do what needs to be done despite their circumstances, and work hard to provide for themselves and their family.
So imagine what $2000 or $3000 means to them. It's significant. Arguably life changing for someone in this demographic.
So one day you stop at their Whatever-stand/cart/business and buy one Whatever. When it's time to pay, you hand them an envelope with $3,000 inside, thank them and leave. Never stop to see them again. They should never see you again....adds to the WTF factor.
To put into context, if you were American and someone you don't know handed you $15,000 in cash, smiled and walked away...you'd be like what the fuck.
That's what $3k would be like for a the average Indian or Filipino, living in their home country.
Why do I do this? Because I give a fuck about people? Nope, definitely not. Like most of the awkward weirdos that have been in Bitcoin for many years, I hate most people. I do it because **fucking with people's brains is fun.**
Think about the gamut of emotions that person is going to experience because of you doing this. Fear, uncertainty, disbelief, happiness....you're gonna be in that guys/girls brain forever. The ultimate mindfuck.
Try it, it's fun.
Higher BTC goes, the more I do this.
I used to give out psychedelic mushrooms that I grew to  people to have this same effect on people's brains. Literally changing the course of the universe. Butterfly effect something something.
Or maybe I just took too many mushrooms myself? 
        ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

If not, I forgive you.
If it is, just...wtf.

Ha, $25? For an international SWIFT transaction, that's fucking cheap. 
In the US it would be $75 at most banks.

Wow, New York Times **NAILED IT** this time. Well done!
There are no glaring inaccuracies in this article whatsoever. Nope, not one.

Good faith when dealing with the Chinese? 
That's not how these people operate. Chinese business ethics are VASTLY different than how we view them in the West. This entire debacle is Chinese as fuck in nature. Anybody that's lived and done business in China knows this.
These fucks take no prisoners. Business Agreements in China are always negotiable..even when they technically aren't. They feel like they need to get every last demand they have...especially when something is so public.
Plus they have some broad sense that their "adversary" is the West, because of "Core" development, etc. This just adds fuel to the fire for them.
"Face" is a bitch. And the Chinese handle embarrassment like a 13 year old girl.

Do not keep the entire puzzle in ANY one location.
Yes, that includes inside of a "safe" deposit box.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:02:50
Ugh. Yeah, I'm racist.
My half Chinese children sleeping downstairs and Chinese wife that just left for work are such a reflection of my bitter hatred for the Chinese.
And oh yeah, that I currently live in Shanghai..and have for many years.
Chinese business practices are different than the rest of the world. They are way more cutthroat. If pointing this fact out makes me a racist...well then you're just another jackass with your virtue signaling, fake, white guilt self.
The Chinese don't need a white guy to come along and "defend" them at every turn. They can defend themselves, they are more than a capable people.
Also...Coinapult Locks sucks. Not sure if you're still a part of that company..but a 10% spread between lock and unlock is just robbery.

Yeah, fuck that.

Of course it's not official. But to a noob, easily scammed.
An attacker could theoretically create a device with predetermined seeds, steer customers to a fake wallet site, or even include fake software.
The smart ones would let the scam proliferate for months before sweeping everything.

Just used mine today.
I received a rate of 0.75% different from Stamp.
For the Bitcoin-to-fiat world, that's actually really cheap.
FUD FUD, everywhere.
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:15:38
Put at ad for +1% over Stamp. You'll sell out in a week, regardless of amount, in any major US city.

Beast mode? YOLO? and (aka I fukn bought BTC and now i have a yacht with bottles and models, so go fuck yourself) ???
I agree his current selection sucks...but what you think is cool sounds fucking lame...lame as fuck.
Baller-on-a-budget, look at me I made $30,000 and I think that's real money, utter douchedom.
The girls may not fuck this guy because he has cartoons on his shirt...but the only girls fucking you are also fucking every other toolbox out there with fake "baller" money.
To the OP, just make some clean stuff. Nothing overdone. Make some weird shit. Take some LSD and think of ideas. Get weird with it.
Weird + obscure + clean looking + not overloaded
...and ignore the 22 year old "baller" crowd of 13-thousand-aires that are currently wearing Ed Hardy t-shirts, or whatever doucheware kids his age are wearing these days.

I think you underestimate the newbieness of newbs.
Not to mention, most of this information is in English. There are rapidly growing crypto communities of people that cannot understand how to do things like this.
This is why things like OneCoin have successfully fleeced investors in places like Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam.
