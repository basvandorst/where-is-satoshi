Its parabolic up 4 times down 4 times, whats the next scenario completely crash or up a 5th time. Id say its highly likely to rebound . Just my thoughts on the whole situation ( im balls deep in crypto rode it up last july rode it down all year . Gone past the point of no return ��)����

How do you come to that conclusion? It went up 4 times and dropped around 80% 4 times. Its next move is up rather than 0

Yeah its a bad feeling alright but your not down until you sell. I didn’t go as crazy as yourself so easier to say on my part I suppose. I put in 12k and down to 3.8 and dropping

Definitely no one has the first notion what its going to do but im basing it off every other bubble , stock or trade . I honestly think it will eventually find its baseline at some point and rebound. As it is now its way to manipulated by the rich and powerful skimming the average folks investments. Then the fear kicks in and they sell at a massive loss helping the rich and powerful even more . Im holding on until the weak hands are all done selling. Really im to far gone to sell
