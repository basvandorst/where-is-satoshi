If no one ever buys at the at All Time High, the price will not go any higher... the trick is to wait till someone like you buys at 20k.

Can someone explain what this "wall" is? How can I read it? What graph is best to see it? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:37:12
They will be TAXing all of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:03:38
Good read. Data only goes till 2013. And they say they estimate only another 2-3 bull after 2013 before reaching universal adoption.
