Coinbase is way to annoying to deal with . Their support is shit. Made a new account, it got locked for some reason and  now they are "working with an expert" to look what the problem is.

you can't "just" be hacked, just make sure that you aren't a complete fool on the internet. and use the right precautions.

It obviously is enough to deploy the code because they are testing it. I don't say it will make millions but it might make enough to cover hosting.

You can hodl, which is more effective on the long term, but if you want to make a quick buck you need to play it on the short term.

It will with thousands using the site per day

Yeah definitely but the people here make it seem like just saying how many bitcoin you have gets you hacked instantly. It is not that easy and it probably needs some sort of social engineering.

Dude, you just publicly told thousands of people you have 42 milion dollars on a hard disk laying in your appartment. people do crazier things for less.

If you do anything serious don't use coinbase, if you need support it will take multiple weeks before any answer. I have heard of multiple people with high value bitcoin getting their account locked.

Can is a strong word, the person needs to be vulnerable in order to be hacked not everyone is vulnerable.
We are not talking about specific people here.

I didn't say I that I know anything about  financials, I was trying to make a point that the whole hodl meme is BS.
