It is weird that BTC sort of holds a monopoly in a market where monopolies can't really be held. It is basically the crypto that will make all other cryptos "go out of business" so to speak.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:35:29
Cab someone explain what this means?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:05:10
24.99 USD or BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:53:28
Sooo should I start buying and hodl?
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:29:01
Serious question: is it truly possible for BTC to actually lose its value completely? It is a currency, not a stock. BTC can't go out of business, and more places are accepting it as an acceptable form of currency. I think it will truly keep going up as long as more places accept it. 
I just wonder if they will normalize the number of BTC and its cost. As in make 1BTC worth 1/1000th of what it currently costs, the multiple everyone's BTC by 1000 so the numbers aren't miniscule numbers like .0000564 BTC and such nonsense.

Yeah I was thinking maybe $2-300. I have some disposable income, so I could start investing in it little by little.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:00:13
How much is worth buying in? I am considering putting some money into this, but certainly don't have the capital to buy a whole BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:30:52
That is the other key part. Could be. BTC could completely crash and become valueless. 
Never invest more than you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:27:16
It is like what happened in the housing crash in '07. Wealthy people went in and bought loads of real estate after forcing a bubble to burst because it became so cheap. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:10:59
Probably more likely that the USD affects BTC, not the other way around. Unless you are talking about a serious depression occurring, then what you suggest is a possibility.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:22:58
It is only a risk if you are putting more than you are able to comfortably throw away. Ask yourself this: would you take your life savings to a casino, or just enough to have fun with?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:34:30
2 words:
Avacado. Toast.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:34:57


it hasn't yet*
It could totally still work.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:37:07


Not this but it is pretty obvious supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:14:31
Is day trading BTC a viable way to make a little extra cash? I don't have the capital to buy anywhere near a whole BTC, but if I could pick up a very small amount and slowly start buying and selling as price keeps going up, I feel like I could make some decent money with little risk.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:42:41


I think this is why it has value.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:28:32
It is when you grip something tightly or put your arms around something. Hodl, on the other hand, is what you do to btc.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:38:27
He doesn't even hodl bro.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:28:43
So just buy BTC with the money the users got back. Pretty simple stuff. Might suck for those who had a lot though because prices may have fluctuated and it turned into a net loss of BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:24:02
Long term they see more value in it. They will profit off of it by tanking it, buying when it is low, and then waiting for the price to increase.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:24:41
This man has a way with words.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:59:52
I'm just going to assume you have like 1000 more BTC that you already sold and are rich. This is awesome of you OP.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:20:27


Based on what I have read on this sub, they don't think it will drop to 12k...
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:51:49
A week? Bro it will be 21k in like 2 days.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:21:02
Okay. Maybe I just put in a little at a time? Say 1-200 per pay period since that isn't breaking the bank for me?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:09:45
Someone is in the Jedi spirit.
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:38:14
If BTC was not so volatile, I would tell OP to see what he could buy with his BTC right now. Then he would need to check in like 5 or 10 years if he had the same buying power. He likely would have less if the exchange rate was roughly the same as it is right now. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:25:55
I'd love to see the "here for the tech" people's input on other tech they are into. 
Here is a hint. They are greedy and just want to make money like everyone else.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:29:32
This is not how this works. BTC experiences inflation just like the USD. BTC is just way more volatile and happens to more than make up the difference from inflation when it is on an upswing. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:45:24
Does BTC generate interest?
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:42:21
So OP's graph is shit then. Got it.
@_date: 2018-03-02 08:52:53
Is he ziplining?
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:54:29
The only thing that will kill BTC is people believing it doesn't have value.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:38:57
It entirely depends on if it will benefit those in power. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:09:47
I thought the purpose of crypto was to *not* have banks involved?
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:04:29
Hodlers must be happy. I wish I bought when it was low. I keep saying that, but with hearing about all the scams happening, I am skeptical and not confident enough in wanting to put a few hundred into it. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:03:24
Or maybe BTC will literally end up being the same as any other currecy where the wealthy can use fiat to purchase large sums of BTC and become the oligarchs of BTC. 
People who think otherwise are fools.
Edit: Downvoted because people don't understand how accumulation of wealth works. lol k
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:21:53
I said this in another thread concerning the same quote. I got downvoted to oblivion. Apparently people don't understand accumulation of wealth. The wealth ones in fiat will start to buy en masse when they see it as a profitable source. The ones who were early miners and hodlers will just join the small number of oligarchs who were wealthy in fiat. Essentially, nothing has changed.
