I shut down my miner (BFL 25GH), and with it my full node. I dont have a computer that runs 24/7 anymore , but I did just install a synology NAS that does!
If there was a linux-idiot-proof way to install a full node on synology, I would. I think many more would too.
However: Im a windows guy, and don't know the first thing about managing linux. I'm allergic to commandlines i think.
Is there a way I can simply goto synology package manager, paste a url or point to a file, hit "Install" and it works? Maybe a package on SynoCommunity? PS: opening &amp; forwarding port 8333 i can do, I'm not a complete idiot :)
Any instructions containing SSH/telnet/certificates/etc or editing a python script or whatnot will probably go over my head and be ignored, unless the instructions are grandma-proof.
Thanx in advance!

oh there's that SSH word... :)
how do I SSH into my Synology?
how do i get that tar file onto it?
can you explain (ELI10, not ELI5) what those commands do exactly?
can this be scripted into the synology package manager?

I have a Synology DiskStation that is on 24/7 and has plenty diskspace but I know jack about Linux. If *someone* could create a one-click-install Bitcoin Full Node package for Synology, I would install it in a heartbeat. I think there are bound to be al lot more people like me. 
(I will not follow 2 pages of "simple" instructions to get it running by hand tho)

Key to getting many nodes online is to make it *really* easy to do it.
"strap a Pi to the top" is way too complicated, and would only be useful for techies.
We want non-techies to be able to run a full node, so it needs to be really plug-and-play...

As I have said here:
and here
I would love this, and I would donate to a bounty for this!
I think this would help to get many more nodes online!

I would love to run a full node on my Synology Diskstation. Plenty diskspace and always on. However I lack the skills to set that up, and so do loads of people. If *someone* could create a fool-proof synology package for a bitcoin full node, I think there would be hundreds if not thousands of nodes added overnight (well: after downloading the entire blockchain).
I would even pay a few euro's for that!
Could something like this benefit from a bounty? Or a lighthouse project? How would that work? Who would decide who gets the bounty?

I don't have reddit bitcoin, but I do have a tip!
This TED clip might be right up your alley: it's about open source and very cheap housing!

May have missed something, but why not p2pool?
I was planning on mining there when my Little Single finally arrives 'in two weeks (TM)'. Are you saying that's a bad idea?

If I try to send 0.02 BTC, the app wants me to confirm sending 2 BTC. Same for 0.0000002 BTC.
I'm in Europe and we normally use a comma (,) for cents, and a dot (.) as a thousand separator. The pad where I can enter the amount only has a dot. Could that be the problem?

While you're at it: how about an open source village starter kit?

I was at this event as a Bitcoin enthousiast and an active member of the dutch Pirate Party, and I had a great time. 
The POS they used was brand new and made by a local dev team, and written entirely in HTML etc so it could run as a webpage on existing iPads, iPhones, windows box, android, whatever.
I talked a bit to the actual devs, and they knew their stuff. I'm gonna go ahead and give them a little plug as a thank you for being part of a cool event!

This is very worrying. If a single exchange joins this program, and a single Bitcoin payment processor (bitpay or somesuch) starts taking only 'clean' coins, then clean coins become more valuable then regular coins, and there will be incentive for the 'nothing to hide' crowd to get their coins cleaned, and then there will be incentive for other exchanges and businesses to get on board as well, or they will miss out on the business of those 'nothing to hide' idiots.
This will not only break the privacy of Bitcoin users, it will break the ability for local farmers to accept bitcoins directly to get away from middlemen, because they will need to either accept only clean coins, or get their coins cleaned themselves, negating any profit they just made because of the extra effort required to accept bitcoins.
Furthermore this plan will place the burden of keeping coins clean on the user, effectively implementing financial self-censorship, arguably an even higher goal for "them" than breaking privacy and the ability to censor payments to WikiLeaks, disincentivise the use of DarkWallet with CoinJoin and the likes.
I see only two ways to stop this from happening: 
1) get enough people and businesses to censor "clean" coins to keep the dollar value of clean coins below that of normal coins. This strategy acknowledges the "divide and conquer" strategy but tries to beat "them" at their game.
2) break the functionality and appeal of the clean coin registry by tainting clean coins, naming and shaming clean addresses and the attached identities, taint the registry itself, show that it cannot and does not adequately protect the data it has on all those people: anything to break trust in that system!
