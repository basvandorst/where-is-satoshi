I see this kind of posts every week.  *Multibit is not for newbies.*
Very easy and very safe setup: hot wallet on unjailbroken iPhone, cold wallet in Trezor or Verso. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:27:07
It is. And change wallet for next time.

The baby or the tee?
@_date: 2016-04-07 02:42:36
Yes they could. The solution is simple though: transfer the bitcoins from the LBC wallet to another "real" wallet and do not consider the payment complete until that transfer has a couple of confirmations on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:42:43
It does, however, indirectly slightly raise the maximum number of transactions that can be included in a block, am I right? I think that's what's meant with transaction limit. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:50:44
"Bitcoin is dead" announcements always seem to drive the price up. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 02:02:13
I have been advising against using Armory forever, especially for newbies. I have heard too many horror stories. 
There are several secure wallets that are way friendlier and easier to use. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 02:46:31
I'll give you a tip: whatever tumbling strategy you use, do not transfer directly from Coinbase to the tumbler, they are known to track transactions they consider suspicious and, worst case, they might freeze your funds. First transfer from Coinbase to Trezor, then tumble and finally receive your anonymized coins with another wallet in Trezor. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 01:46:51
You are quoting yourself as a source to prove your point?! Really?
@_date: 2016-04-15 23:55:50
Aaaand.... The price starts climbing. We need more "bitcoin is dead" predictions.
@_date: 2016-04-18 03:55:09
How soon for iOs?
@_date: 2016-04-07 17:40:41
Yes, it happened to many, many people before you. Circle (same goes for Coinbase) owns "your" money (both fiat and btc) and they seem to be very arrogant about it. They regularly and arbitrarily close down accounts and from what I read it's not easy to get your money back. Keep emailing and making your complaint public. People must know. 
A suggestion to everyone using Circle and Coinbase: use them to buy and sell your btc if you have to but never, ever leave any balance with them. Transfer in, exchange and transfer out as quickly as possible. IAW, do not use them as a bank. Actually, do not use anyone as a bank. Only use wallets of which you control the keys. 
Edit: one word
@_date: 2016-04-10 00:12:42
They are a trustworthy company. Write to support and be patient. You might want to try and login again next week. 
Starting soon, withdrawals must be made through a manual process which will include in-depth verification and anti-fraud measures. 
More details about steps and documentation required will be announced next week.

They are. But in fairness it's not completely their fault, they have to comply with Big Brother's requirement or they will be shut down. All we can do is leave as little balance as possible with them and transfer btc out a.s.a.p.

AFAIK, European debit cards do not work online. POS only, with PIN. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 05:57:00
It is certainly true in at least two European countries: The Netherlands and Italy. Europeans: can you use a DEBIT card online in your country? (Debit cards are those that are commonly issued to get money from ATMs)
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:11:51
tl;dr: Bigotry is inevitable, this will be very beneficial for Bitcoin in the long term.
One of the main selling points for Bitcoin is that it can withstand abuse by authorities and prevent identity theft by hackers.
Since (thankfully) it proved to be extremely effective against both threats, it's logical  that it is being embraced for such use cases. 
Bigots will *always* rely on fear (e.g. of drugs or terrorism) and insert 'think of the children' in *any* discussion. Reason is futile against dogma and hidden agendas.
I believe that the sex industry might well be the 'killer app' that will jumpstart Bitcoin to wider acceptance, less volatility and probably much higher value. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 00:06:54
It would be ironical if Apple were the one to create the killer app for Bitcoin. *If* that happens though, the moon would be around the corner. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 06:49:32
I hope this takes off, it looks very cool. One suggestion: why burn the fee when there so many good causes that can use the money? Couldn't users vote on chain what the current destination for fees would be?
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:27:27
It is actually quite secure because they require the extra password for online purchases (3D secure.) Some banks issue it as a password, which requires a significant amount of information to generate, other banks send a one time password by SMS to the owner's registered cell phone, effectively making it a real 2FA. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:27:32
Did you even read the article?
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:03:29
There must be one more reason, at least in some jurisdictions-if law enforcement catches you handing out weed and getting money for it, you go to jail. If you "give it away" and receive no payment for it (and no cash on you), you can probably get away with the story that you are sharing with a friend, at least if the quantity is limited. 
It is a lot harder to prove that a payment took place on the blockchain, especially if police cannot access the cell phone. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:03:34
Yes, possibly the crypto that best respects the user's privacy. It used to be called darkcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:47:37
Exchanges log your IP address. Most exchanges have your email. Some exchanges have your cell phone number. If you do not take precautions, it's not that hard to link an exchange to your identity. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:05:21
Indeed-the perfect solution to verify payment without carrying the money. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:25:52
If you convert to Dash though, and transfer it once to another Dash address, the link is broken. 
So: bitcoin to dash (over tor)-dash to dash-dash to new bitcoin address (with a different tor identity and ideally spread over a few transactions.) 
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:44:41
I don't disagree with you but you'll have to admit it's still a huge improvement if switching from vanilla Gmail. At least I trust they won't use the contents of my messages to profile me and target ads.

IMO, their privacy policy is scary. I'll pass. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 18:10:01
So it's not an online charge. Only with physical card which is exactly what I said and you said it is not true.

You'd have to change the QR code on the front side as well. The site seems to suggest that it is possible: 'QR code and private key can be changed without damaging the piece'
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:14:23
I disagree. Bitcoin privacy might not be perfect but it's a lot better than a check.
I am not saying it's impossible but it's a lot harder to track bitcoin transactions if one takes a bit of precautions. Buy on localbitcoins in one country, send to hd wallet over tor, to a wallet connected to an IP located in a different country, finally send to a newly generated address. That requires a lot more investigative work and international subpoenas, compared to finding out where a check comes from.
@_date: 2015-06-06 05:29:42
I'd be very happy even without those features.
You might be able to implement a remote control panel through a web interface though, to block the app or delete its data remotely. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:02:11
Yes, in the Localbitcoins wallet page there is a list of all transaction with the corresponding hash. That is your best hope. 
Next time, use a real wallet.

Definitely not true.

Dash is way harder to taint than most other cryptocoins. One dash transfer and you are good to go. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:04:55
Yes but. The exchange could receive a subpoena and if the exchange knows who you are, you are screwed.

.... which can be reversed.

I had gotten it was a joke, not the reference. However I still wanted OP to know that some services, like the one I mention are actually free and work well.
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:24:16
Any idea when we'll have a decently usable beta?
This is the one service I have most been looking forward to. I donated several times and I pray for the dev's well-being but the wait is frustrating...
@_date: 2015-05-25 02:25:18
If few people use them, no, they don't, I agree since using them raises a red flag.
However, the point I made elsewhere in this thread is that once virtually every bitcoin wallet ups their privacy standards to, say, Darwallet level, which I think will happen eventually, then yes, fungibility issued is solved because all coins are virtually impossible to taint and no white/blacklisting at all is possible.
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:34:00
Agreed, I only handle my hot and semi-hot wallets from an unjailbroken iOs device.

You want to give more voting power to those who have more money to burn. That's not acceptable in a democratic vote. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 00:05:59
If I understand OP's point of view correctly, the answer is that mixing bitcoins could be a red flag for regulators. However, that's only true if a minority of users do it. Once every wallet automatically mixes coins and uses some version of stealth addresses, hard-to-taint bitcoins will be the default. At that point the only option for regulators would be to either give up regulating (I know...) or ban bitcoins altogether. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:15:02
Don't use blockchain.info.  They have a terrible track record.
Unless you set up a watch only address. But if you have to set up another address anyway, why not just use Coinkite.

Indeed. It is disgusting that he has to beg to get a small part of his own money back. A lot of which will go to lawyers to stop the government from extraditing him to the U.S. where he presumably would be locked away forever. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:09:15
Coinkite is freemium. And even for the free plan they offer a trustless wallet where only the user has the key. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:18:08
How trustworthy are they?
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:36:34
I lost bitcoins with breadwallet (due to the freaking need to re-sync that takes forever) and lots of time with Trezor (due to the downtime of the back end and the horrible quality of the cable.) I am done with both of them. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:45:58
Wrong. If you had used Coinkite for as long as I have, you'd know that luck wouldn't be enough to build all they have built. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:44:27
So who's going to develop, maintain and give assistance to users? The 'open source community' has obviously been unable to provide that to non geek users (i.e. the silent majority that is unwilling to spend hours on forums every time there is a doubt or glitch.)
I do not see why good, honest developers and entrepreneurs shouldn't make money to support their families when they offer easy to use, secure and trustless solutions. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:18:36
Dark Wallet, where are you??
@_date: 2016-03-19 14:48:04
Any 2FA would do. Ideally one that is mobile friendly. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:33:06
Greenaddress works perfectly on any phone, it's trustlees, easy to use and absolutely safe (if you write down the 24 word seed of course.)
Coinkite can also be access from a phone, but you'll need to use a mobile browser, which is a bit more inconvenient. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 23:59:51
I bet my bitcoin stash on option 3. We are seeing the first baby steps already (Darkwallet, Samourai.) Eventually, most wallets will implement new and better privacy enhancing features just like it is happening in this moment with HD, non-reusable addresses.
Edit: spelling 
@_date: 2016-03-20 04:04:41
Thanks for sharing your side of the story.
I'm with you that deleting wallets should not be allowed. I believe that was Satoshi's vision. If a user truly wants to destroy a wallet (why?), user should destroy his keys. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 05:27:51
Classy exit is classy. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 01:34:06
This sounds shady. I do not believe for a moment that Greenaddress asked for money. I reached out to Greenaddress support many, many times over the years and I always received all the the help I needed without any request for money. 
You were either scammed by a third party or you are making this up. 
Proof or it did not happen. 
EDIT: Your story is true, apologies for not believing you. I'm glad to hear that you will be able to recover your funds. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:03:39
Yes, I think so. There are better wallets for the average user. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 00:47:20
With this attitude you wonder why you get downvotes?
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:24:24
What's your source? Mine is personal experience: I have a free multisig wallet of which Coinkite holds no keys.
@_date: 2016-03-19 14:51:12
Good point. Bitmessage is actually surprisingly easy to set up and use. I2P requires a bit more work but is even more private and secure. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 00:35:34
Less fun maybe but more likely to succeed imho. Especially if you use a very user friendly "coupon service", maybe one that optionally allows to open a (safe) wallet if you don't have one. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:27:18
Very unfair. While his exit was not elegant imho, he has done a lot for bitcoin and we should be grateful for that. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 00:30:01
Agreed. They are very helpful. Don't panic and don't do anything stupid meanwhile, your bitcoins should be safe.
Edit: you could safely try the following imo. Restart everything, use a different browser (ideally the Chrome app if you are not using Chrome now) and start fresh with your mnemonic seed. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:04:43
There is another option actually. Buyer has access to stolen Paypal accounts.

@_date: 2016-01-04 21:03:28
Say that to the next newbie who will lose their money in their bc.i wallet. I think it's irresponsible to link to them (unless you add a huge warning DO NOT USE.)
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:21:33
A few. I don't remember names but it's usually ppl with conflicts of interest. 
Say that you are developing a project that somehow clears transactions off chain (in your own system) and only commits to the real blockchain once in a while. Full blocks would force ppl to use their system. This is an hypothetical example of course. Oh wait, it's not. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:24:55
In simple words, we need to fork away from Bitcoin core. By creating a new system run by other people (crucially), we solve half of the problem. The other half of the problem is solved by agreeing on some way to increase block size in the new system. 
Of course, the new system must be supported by a significant majority of miners. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:03:32
It's unfair to speak in such terms about a person who did so much for bitcoins. We can dispute facts until the cows come home. He stated his facts, you stated yours. 
In fact, I agree with most of your analysis. But the title could have been "'Why I disagree with Mike and I think Bitcoin has a bright future.'
My point being that if both Mike and you had behaved more nicely, Bitcoin would be a better place to be. All these insults and divisions are hurting Bitcoin more than anything.

From personal experience, I can confirm the best uptime in the industry. I have done many transactions a day for as long as Coinkite exists. Uptime in my case has been 100%. No other wallet has achieved that in my use case. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 21:06:25
You should add greenaddress.it 
Multi-sig, 2 FA, notifications, spending limits, all platforms, easy to use...
It's my favorite wallet and the new version (I am currently testing the closed beta) is even better. 
Edit: I was referring to iOs. I see it is listed for Android. Well, it's also available for iOs, as Chrome app and on the web. No id a about Windows phone. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:41:27
Indeed, I had not understood. Now I understand and I think it's a terrible idea, as others have pointed out. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 04:06:42
You simply create another wallet with a different password.
@_date: 2016-06-06 03:36:46
@_date: 2016-11-21 05:53:20
You miss the point that in the event of a double spend, the service can be revoked. Furthermore, there are techniques that have a decent chance to spot double spends within a few seconds. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:03:40
Almost everybody (even those who are against XT) seems to agree that block size is a problem and should have been upped already.

@_date: 2015-08-16 03:31:20
How would you register voters? One vote per address? So that people can start making million of new empty addresses to get more voting power? Or one per bitcoin? So that rich people have more votes? Would you rather set up an authority to register voters and verify IDs?
I don't mean to be negative but the only voting the bitcoin ecosystem supports is mining to build the Blockchain. Which is exactly the kind of voting we were trying to discuss. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:57:52
I find this comment so infuriating that I cannot decide whether I should upvote it so that more redditors see what kind of views you hold or downvote you to karma hell.
To answer your question: no, 3 days of discussion about the biggest issue currently on the table are not enough. I am glad to see that hundreds of redditors are showing their discontent with the way you are moderating/censoring this subreddit. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 00:30:07
Unfortunately, he seems to be the only one among the mods. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:38:03
Meanwhile, XT is here and Lightning is not. Correct me if I am wrong. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:28:31
Nope. You said that the only logical assumption is that the hits the sub took are due to the community behavior. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:25:14
While I love the quote in itself, I think the way traditional currencies went only reflects that we do not live in real democracies any more.

Imho, 2FA is not just "nice", it's crucial. I know it saved my bitcoin ass a couple of times. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 01:15:03
Downvoted for being extraordinarily unfair and misleading. 
This is clearly a problem on your side. I mean, you decide to use an unsupported browser and then you warn the community to be ware of these guys? Really?
What are you implying anyway? That they tried to steal your bitcoins? By design Greenaddress does not even have access to your funds.
I have used Greenaddress since the beginning, I can vouch for their honesty and capabilities. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:57:21
Any malware that takes control of (a part of) your computer could invalidate any and all security a wallet might implement (Trezor being the only exception AFAIK.)

@_date: 2015-08-18 23:19:18
Oh please. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:01:25
After this mess can you actually say with a straight face that people are leaving because of the community's behavior? Has it not occurred to you that people leave because we are disgusted by the censorship and the conflict of interest by the mods?
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:59:08
I wish I could downvote you twice. You obviously have 0 knowledge of bitcoin and you are making false accusations which could hurt honest people. 
Again, 'they' have NO WAY to take money from you. 
Edit: As for the 24-word mnemonic, Trezor (undoubtedly one of the safest wallets out there) uses the same length. Greenaddress, however, offers a very convenient short PIN on trusted devices. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 00:30:13
Coinkite for uptime and reliability, Greenaddress for convenience (mobile apps, quick view-only access and PIN-only option on trusted devices are *very* convenient.)
Optionally, Trezor for top security and significant amounts (even though both previously mentioned options can be very secure since they offer trustless multi-sig.)
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:03:26
I and many other did. That does not change the fact that blatant censorship is not ok anywhere, much less on Reddit, especially if there is reasonable suspicion that the ones doing the censorship seem to have financial motives and conflict of interest. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 00:12:12
Even if they are, by using Tor and Dash (with a few Dash to Dash transfers in between) one can reach the best possible anonymization of coins. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:21:44
The lack of fanfare might be due to plain old censorship. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:21:11
... and  will hopefully die a painful death (unless the current fascist mods finally resign)
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:53:00
Why don't *you* use another altcoin to handle that use case?! My vote is for bitcoin to be as useful and fungible as possible. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:43:41
If your computer is ridden with malware, you cannot safely do anything, leave alone use a wallet.
You can find guidelines for safe computing in many places, it would be redundant to go in detail here. You might want to start by dumping Windows, the latest version makes it clearer than ever than Windows itself is the mother of all malware.
Edit: to actually answer your question, I thought I should share what I consider the safest way of using a wallet: either Trezor on any platform or any good wallet on an iPhone. I agree with Aaron Voisine, developer of breadwallet - "With AES hardware encryption, TouchID, app sandboxing, keychain and code signatures, iOS devices currently represent the most secure computing platform."
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:56:40

Firstly, yay, I just realized that it finally launched.
Arguibly, mailpile is the most secure option since everything is self-hosted. However, unfortunately that is its biggest weakness too. A lot of users, even the security conscious, won't have the means and the will to run an always-on server for their email. A lot of people I know don't even own a desktop computer any more.

Yes, a cell phone will significantly reduce you privacy.
However, that does not reduce the value of having a more secure email instead of an email service that reads every message and sells everything they know about you to the highest bidder. Which is literally what Google, Facebook and the like are doing.

Thank you for all the useful info.
A word of advice if I may. Since you deal with sensitive information, I think it's highly recommended to avoid e-mail communication if it all possible. Imho, you should at the very least publish a public PGP key or, better yet, offer the alternative of a means of communication which also hides metadata ( not easy, I know, maybe bitmessage... ?)

Your statement that multisig wallets are cold storage, however, is factually wrong. 
In fact, multi-sig can arguably be more useful for hot wallets since those are much more exposed to threats.

No it's not hard at all. In fact, they offer two different options to recover your funds without their signature:

2) 2-of-3 multi-sig.

You don't *have* to provide your phone number. It's up to the seller to decide whether they'll do business with you if you don't provide your phone number. Same for ID-Sellers have the right to demand a verified ID and buyers can pick another seller if they are not prepared to provide it.
It's a matter of mutual agreement and in my experience there are plenty options even for the most privacy conscious, especially if you pay cash.

I believe Tor is ideal to connect to sites that have a .onion address, like Bitmixer.io and Coinkite (since that avoids the possibility of MITM and malicious exit nodes.)
For clearnet, however, Tor is not recommended.
Source: Localbitcoins.com has an explicit warning against using Tor and Cryptocoins News article "Why Bitcoin over Tor may not be a good idea" (apologies for not including the links, I am on mobile)
@_date: 2015-04-22 02:49:41
Stick to Coinkite. Really. In my experience it works incredibly well, it's trustless, always available, easy to use and offers incredibly powerful multisig. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 21:47:03
I propose a faster, easier, trustless* and free alternative.
1. Alice and Bob both open a Greenaddress wallet
2. Bob sends bitcoins to Alice with the 'instant confirmation' option enabled.
3. There is no 3
* The transfer itself is trustless, since it is on the blockchain and Greenaddress does not hold the users' key. Only the 'instantness' requires trust in Greenaddress.

@_date: 2015-04-12 21:58:56
Exactly. Plus, Greenaddress requires much less trust imo, since the transaction is on the blockchain and they don't have the user's private key. So if they went evil, they could fake the instant confirmation but not run with your bitcoins.
(Assuming nlock time is enabled and wallet code is not replaced by an evil version.)

I had noticed it. That's one of the reasons why I use Coinkite for both hot and cold storage (with multisig.) 
@_date: 2015-04-27 05:33:32
Why would popularity contribute to quality? Most of us know that the most popular online wallet, which you listed as  has been  in fuckups. Including publishing private keys of users. Coinkite, on the other hand, which gained the last place in your list, offers fully trustless, very powerful multisig (up to 15 keys) and a very easy to use platform. I also like their optional .onion access, an underrated but very important feature imo. 
Sorry dude, you are giving terrible advice, downvoted.
If I were to set up such a list, I would put Coinkite and Greenaddress at the top and blockchain.info as a "avoid at all cost". My advice is based on a lot of personal experience.

You are right when sending signed transactions from your own wallet.
It's not only your wallet you'll have to deal with though. Some (most) steps will happen over the web. Tumblers are web services. Exchanges (which inevitably include a wallet) are web services.
"Someone who runs a malicious relay can use an encryption removal technique known as SSL stripping, that essentially strips away SSL protection, to either alter the traffic coming through or create a fake SSL certificate."
"Only a few months ago, some unlucky Blockchain.info and LocalBitcoins.com users had their wallets hacked, losing a cumulative tens of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin."

"When using a Tor browser you are at risk for man-in-the-middle-attacks by malicious Tor exit nodes. A malicious Tor exit node intercepts the traffic between your computer and LocalBitcoins and then steals your bitcoins."

Both Coinkite and Greenaddress offer a setup where the user has full, trustless access and the wallet owner has provably no access to your coins. You are right about the other ones though, they own your coins and should be used for small amounts only, if at all.

2 of 3 multisig: one key with you, one with the beneficiary, one in safe deposit box.
It covers all your bases: if you need to access your funds, you go to safe deposit box. If beneficiary needs to access your funds and they legally inherit access to safe deposit box, they can do the same with their key. If above mentioned dementors access the safe deposit box while you are alive, you and beneficiary can get together and empty the wallet. You are only screwed if dementors access deposit box after you passed but before beneficiary gets to it (unless beneficiary can access your key after your death.) That too can be solved, if it is a concern, with M of N signatures, by 'spreading out' more keys, the possibilities are endless. 
Very easy to set up (for free) with Coinkite. 
Note: I am in no way affiliated with Coinkite, just a very happy user.

I tried to use Greenaddress three times today to send coins. The first and the third time, the system was 'stuck' and could not send. The second time it went through flawlessly and confimed fine. 
Bottom line, Greenaddress seems to have some problems today but *if* it allows sending, I think you can send your payment safely with them, I never experienced any serious delays.
Greenaddress always includes a fee, I am not sure why you mention sending without a fee.
Alternatively, if you are going to use another wallet, I highly recommend Coinkite, their uptime and functionality is consistently 100%. 
Feel free to PM me if you need more advice, I have a lot of experience sending coins under pressure, often with Greenaddress.

Sorry dude but you totally misunderstood how LBC works. The escrow is for bitcoins, not for fiat (your country's currency.)
You should have waited for the wire to be in your account before releasing the escrow.
You can't even file a report with LBC admins since their terms state that if you release the escrow, they won't intervene. 
As someone else pointed out, the buyer should not even have your email address, unless you gave it to him (which would be another big mistake and a brach of LBC terms.)
In case you want to do this again, I'd also recommend against using wire transfers, there have been scams where it somehow got reversed after it appeared in the seller's account.
Also, if you want to sell less than 0.4 BTC, you could offer on a sell ad rather than creating an ad yourself. You'll get a bit less money but arguably deal with more reliable sellers (always check the reputation of course.)

Edit: MtGox was theoretically and practically the worst wallet to date. Warnings had been posted for months. You are not well informed. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:05:48
Coinkite or Greenaddress. Either can be setup as fully trustless multi-sig. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:18:08
Each person can sign separately, *do not* to send private keys, that would be terrible for security.
The easiest way I know to do what you want (if I understand correctly) is with Coinkite. Each user can go to a signing page to put their signature and the transaction is authorized when the required number of signatures is reached.

Of course I had my backup seed words but that invalidates the very reason of owning a Trezor: ease of use and immediate withdrawals.
I also think it is a problem that I spent 120 bucks on a product that I found unreliable (poorly built hardware, esp. the cable and the connector and, at times, erratic backend.)
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:27:16
You are arguing semantics. Any definition can be made narrow enough to prove your point. I could say that your setup is not trustless since you did not build the chips inside the system where the node runs. 
Meanwhile, in real life, I can use a 2 of 3 multisig online wallet and enjoy the convenience and the extra security (because 2FA) of having one key with the web wallet. 
And so should OP, in my opinion. 
OP, use Coinkite multi-sig or Greenaddress 2-of-3, set up 2FA and choose a good password (if Coinkite.) I promise you, that's way easier and more convenient than running your own node. It's also more secure if you are not an expert (based on your question, I assume you aren't.)

Congratulations at Coinkite team. Imho, Coinkite Multisig is the best cold wallet solution out there. Period. I dumped my Trezor and happily went back to 
Coinkite. Less headaches and 100% uptime, unlike Trezor back end.
Coinkite also offer a good hot wallet, one of my favorites (I prefer Greenaddress as hotwallet though, mainly for the native app and the quick login on trusted devices.)

To be safer, the seller should require a picture if the deposit slip torn in 4. Only exceptionally stupid bank employees (...) will give money back if the deposit slip is torn.
@_date: 2015-03-24 04:28:01
Localbitcoins has a very efficient section for online trades as well. It's easy, quick and safe, if you pick a vendor with a good reputation. Con: a little bit more expensive probably. 
Feel free to PM me if you need some guidance. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:16:29
How about mobile access though?

Gavin already confirmed that he is sure, behind reasonable doubt, and after several cryptographic verifications on a clean computer, that this guy *is* indeed Satoshi.

I use the iOs app on both iPhone and iPad dozens of times a day. It never froze, not once. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 04:20:53
How about Coinkite? They are bitcoin only and very respectful of their users' privacy.  I never used their merchant tools, but it seems very safe and rather powerful. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 03:48:31
I would not recommend Armory for newbies. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 16:26:47
How many times do we need to repeat this:
BLOCKCHAIN.INFO SHOULD NOT BE USED. NEVER. EVER. PERIOD.
I feel bad for you and everyone that keeps losing their money but frankly, there have been thousands of warnings for years about this. 
Also, there is no excuse for skipping 2FA, you should not handle money on-line, bitcoins or otherwise, without 2FA.

It's way faster to access

Italy has had exactly the same restriction for several years.

It was an issue for a while. It has not happened for many months. Not to me at least, and I use it several times a day every day.

I for one would like to know what he thinks of all the money donated for the development of Darkwallet. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 04:06:23
No. Localbitocins requires 3 confirmations before you can even advertise you have btc for sale. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 00:22:48
Yes and yes and yes. However, x-pubs implementations differ between wallets so basically it'd only work if both you and the payer use a wallet that implements it. Samourai's solution seems what you are looking for but not everyone believes in that implementation. Plus, Samourai is Android only. 
tl;dr: to answer your original question: No, it's not really practical at the moment. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 20:22:20
DarkWallet will make it much harder to taint coins -&gt; prevents freezing or confiscating  funds based on their alleged history -&gt; increased fungibility.

It's fast, easy and very safe.
Great iOs app, available on PC and all other platforms, trustless multi-sig, 2FA, and many more optional functions if you need them (spending limits, view-only login, quick login (PIN only) for trusted devices, etc.) 
And good customer service should you ever need assistance. 
It got a bad rep because it went off-line a few times in the past (for a short time, no funds lost) but it has not happened to me for a long time.

I wish Protonmail had native apps for mobile, with notifications. That's the main reason why I prefer Tutanota. 
@_date: 2016-05-22 17:32:03
You will have a wider user basis once you launch an iOs implementation. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 04:38:13
Coinkite, with 2FA. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 23:41:25
You should, it's great. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 01:06:40
1) 2FA might have prevented the hack and 2) bc.i should not be used anyway for a million reasons. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 04:21:45
It's easy, you don't have the keys to your bitcoins, they do. You basically have an IOU, nothing more. They could take your bitcoins from you for any reason (or no reason), freeze your account, etc..
@_date: 2015-10-21 02:41:31
I might be missing something here... What do you need help for? You received the bitcoins you sent, didn't you? The invalid double spend was eventually dropped, so there's nothing wrong here. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 16:10:33
Indeed. And the sad part is-it's probably still safer than being U.S. based. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 01:54:43
Nope. If you sendit to an off-line wallet, it's for long term storage, you won't be able to tumble (wash) it from there. 
The right order would be buy-transfer to hot wallet-tumble to other addresses-move to cold storage (offline.)
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:06:38
Irrelevant if you use the 'good' online wallets which are completely trustless. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 07:26:35
Or... buy/confiscate enough miners to control the entire network. 
To answer your question-nothing can stop 'them' and I believe that's the biggest threat to Bitcoin.

Some do already

Sign the Genesis block, fine, those coins can't even be spent anyway iirc. 
Move coins, no please, that would create panic in the market and that's the last thing we need. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:56:40
Terrible advice. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:21:22
This! Trezor has failed one time too many for me, if only temporarily. After the last trezor scare (bad cable or connector I guess), Coinkite is my only cold wallet. I have used Coinkite since the very beginning and it is the only wallet that has never let me down, not even for a second.

How about selling on Localbitcoins in exchange for a Western Union transfer. Most countries allow money transfers to Cuba.
