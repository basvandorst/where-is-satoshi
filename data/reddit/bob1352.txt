Bitcoin isn't even a currency anymore the transaction fees are far too high. At least USD can be used.

Turns into a good amount of what money again? The fact that your using the dollar as a means to measure growth proves alot. You can't buy goods using Bitcoin anymore, if it is worthless as a currency why does it have value? Doesn't make a lot of sense. Only thing that can save it now is LN, but that may take years to bear fruit, as was proven with Segwit. Just look at the Bitcoin convention that was forced to stop taking payments. As of right now, Bitcoin isn't in a great state.

But why? Unlike Litecoin or Ether, Bitcoin cannot be used as a medium of exchange which is its purpose. If anything Bitcoin will be replaced by a more useable coin.
