I would say this is the most accurate explanation of my aha moment as well.
edit:having said that I was instantly hooked.  I listen to audiobooks or courses at work so right after listening to TTC's currency course I listened to Parmy Olsen's book about anonymous, and well, the rest just writes itself.

My first bitcoins were bought using money I was going to spend anyway.  I wanted to see american netflix so I wanted a VPN.  I had just heard about bitcoins and wanted to try them out.  I bought $100 worth of bitcoins  and spent about $50 on the VPN.
Forgot about bitcoins for a year... Had to renew VPN...
I will never need to buy more bitcoins to pay for my VPN.

I think we should rename them diceware wallets and they would still have the novelty of being easy to write down and remember, but it would remind people of the need for randomness.

I remember after years of trying to get my parents to buy me a computer they finally did, then to my horror it didn't come with a modem.  
I saved up for a few months with my paper route to buy a 14.4k modem only to find out in horror that my parents didn't want me to get an internet account because they figured I would get bored with it and then they would be stuck in a six month deal or whatever.
Eventually I got a friend to let me use his account for a while and so I was trying to show them how awesome it was with the DOS irc and if I remember correctly there was even a DOS HTML client.  I tried showing them some web pages and after the three minutes of loading some travel web site, they were not convinced.  
In Windows 3.1 you would have to connect to the internet and also run winsock TCP I think it was.  It was a whole procedure.
Then one year I came home from university for the summer and tried to convince them to get "high speed internet".  Of course they were happy with the dial up and didn't imagine the extra $10 or whatever a month would be worth it for what they used the internet for, even though they did use it a lot by this point.
Of course now they have fiber op and like to brag about how great it is as it isn't available in my area.
I remember being considered a nerd for even knowing what the internet was. "What did you do last night? Go on the internet?"

but isn't there always people looking to cash out? For every person buying bitcoins isn't there a person selling them?  What is the difference between selling at an exchange or just directly buying the thing you were going to buy with the money from selling on an exchange?
Bitcoins are also great for saving up for something.  I started saving for a new ca in the summer.  I have bitcoins in savings but I knew I needed a new vehicle in the next 6 months so I started saving for a new car with bitcoins.  It was money that was going to go to a car, but rather than bank or mattress, I used bitcoins.
Well, the car turned out to be a lot less of a financial burden then I was expecting.

here here to the live cd.  I am shocked by how often I read about using live cd's with bitcoins, but try to actually find some instructions on making one?
Some random guy can't just make a live distro because everyone would be suspicious of it.  It is easy to make your own live cd, till you get into installing electrum or armory on them. 
It's not even all that easy to put bitaddress.org on the desktop of a livecd, and I have never been able to find instructions on how to do it from the bitcoin community.
Remastersys is not ideal but easy.
tl;dr: remastersys for livecd's, somebody do a tutorial.

those numbers are entirely inaccurate.

I was surprised by a few I made as experiments.
'correct horse eskimo staple' I ended up moving to 'steal my bitcoins' after a while and since I was just playing around with pybitcointools and the like I moved it out.  
I can't believe a multisig address I made with sx hasn't been emptied, I guess they don't try to bruteforce them.  I would have moved it out if I could get it to work...

I know this paranoia that you speak of.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:49:00
yes but it's still "grains of sand" to follow the analogy.  And if bitcoin really takes off, individual people could have thousands of address, or like jars of sand, corporations would have mountains of sand.  It just seems hard to grasp that my sand won't get mixed up in someone else's sand.  Ignore any mention of brainwallets, as I mean diceware brainwallets which with 12 words are 128 bit I believe...

quickbt.com for small amounts
cavirtex.com for large amounts

A private key is used to generate the public key so if they generate the same public address then they know your private key which means they can spend those coins.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:22:32
Yes the reason is chargebacks.
In Canada quickbt.com is great for using your interac card to instantly buy them.

Tell me more about this challenge...
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:34:38
but it's not really people picking up individual grains of sand, as people bruteforcing brainwallets would be driving away with dump trucks of sand, I would imagine.  Also, humans have been known to move mountains of sand and in general change the landscape in quite a bit.  What are the chances that somebody's grain of sand gets caught up in all this sand moving, over the years?
It's still just a small number, I know, but it is hard for the brain to grasp.
Great video, by the way.

why would the return not be as good?  Just because they are the biggest doesn't mean you are going to make any more, the block reward just gets spread out to more miners on bigger pools.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:39:19
I don't really think there is much way around it.
I have often wondered though why you can't buy gift cards, like from gas stations and the like, that would be loaded at the time of purchase... Maybe someday.

Ever since I started to grasp bitcoins I have dreamt of a government starting an alt coin, say 'canada coin' just so that all government spending could be public.
Certainly not going to happen any time soon.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:03:10
I don't in any way understand why those miners don't spread out to other pools.  I don't know of anything that makes btc guild better than any others, but it is consistently the biggest.
