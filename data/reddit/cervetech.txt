Not sure about Discover card facts but if its a viable form of payment with no unusual costs to accept what do you care what someone has in their wallet. Plenty take Amex and cost on merchant is higher than Visa or Mastercard. My point is if you went through setting up acceptance of Bitcoin why turn around and pull it. Maybe it was just a band wagon publicity stunt in the first place.

This is sad. Would you stop accepting discover card because most people do not carry one?

Agreed. I just saw myself folding dollars, thinking that this might be the last time I see them worth $1. However lets say I stuff my 0.01 paper wallets instead, we might be able to buy his car at 16, college at 19, and law school at 23.

I totally understand the skepticism, but its Easter. Will is my boy and he deserves my support. BTC is awesome and I believe in its potential. So what better platform then @_date: 2014-03-14 03:48:09
Takes feed the pig to a whole new level
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:08:09
Thats not a bad idea, and once I have the opportunity to explain to him what btc is in the first place we could even go that route. I am sure he will be asking me today as I have linked the post on his FB wall. And you are correct your identity is meaninglessness, pseudo anonymous donations on the other hand.....

Just left the bitcoin meet up at Latin House.  Paid my tab in bitcoin, and spoke with some of the best local bit coin minds. To the moon gents.

Hadn't seen anyone actively pitching to coinstar, however I doubt my drunk ass was the first to think of this.
