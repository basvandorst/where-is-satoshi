Got it.
@_date: 2014-02-23 02:11:11
Awesome. When do you guys go? The employee mentioned the San Diego Bitcoin meetup going there every couple weeks.
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:55:03
Have you used it? I just signed up for an account, but I'm still not sure how to get my trapped Gox BTC out. Any help?  
  
edit: Nvm, I think I figured it out.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:20:11
Nam Dog. He's struggling to cope.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:01:18
Oh nice, thanks
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:58:14
That sounds like a lot with a "30 billion" in the figure. Just how many lives did he *ruin* pushing that shit on the streets??? 
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:25:03
Scary words for a development like this
@_date: 2014-04-23 17:48:06
Ok thanks. I just thought it sounded funny. Like, "Sure you can help this cause, send money here!" ...and then profit.
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:56:46
Thanks!

**.**20 USD?
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:35:08
Yea man, just withdraw the bitcoin, and then-- oh wait.
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:14:07
Great. You've just spawned another alt-coin.
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:46:00
Secretly link your Bitcoin  wallet, and sit back and profit as the beer begins to flow into your wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:14:44
Who am I? 
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:41:02
I know. I still didn't catch it. Fucking trains are so loud.
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:34:19
Oh shit. Are you serious? That's terrible.  
  
I hope they pull their heads out of their Goxes and get shit running again.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:06:46
Why/how would that happen?
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:13:47
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:02:50
Yes, I think this is the point. It's not that they broke some insider trading law by doing this, they're just continuing to erode any trust the public may still have in them.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:01:32
Maybe they should loan the actual money they earn in profits.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:33:43
They don't only give out interest. They also charge fees. You're telling me that the only money banks make is in making loans?
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:55:19
Give me back my bitcoins! 
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:24:52
Because he has exchanged his bitcoins for Schrute Bucks, which has to be done through the mail. Try to follow along here.
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:41:17
Go on...
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:25:59
You love the trollbox? I right click and "inspect element" and resize it to 1x1 just to get rid of it.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:17:55
Ahh gotcha. Thx.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:19:00
Why, are you ready to invest? 
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:06:55
Sometimes the worst news is no news.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:41:36
Bitalo sounds like a great concept. I'm so comfortable trading on BTC-e though. And I can trade automatically with python code that can execute trades for me. It's hard to leave the place you're so used to.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:12:25
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:06:40


  
Did they just announce that they were confiscating all the coins left in their exchange?
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:41:10
Look, when a Nigerian Prince asks for your help, you can't just ignore that. His dad ran the entire country.
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:33:45
[Here's to hoping some of these bitcoins trickle down to me...](
