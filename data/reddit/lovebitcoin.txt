Yes, exchanges nowadays have too big right and too little obligations, just like stock exchanges in early days.

I support this requirement!
Today we can see the exchanges have too much right, and they should be regulated by government to bear much more obligation.
Bitcoiners then will find there bitcoins more secure if the exchanges have to registered and be supervised.
Fraudsters and people who make illegal actions will have a tough day, please go away from bitcoin! These people are poison to bitcoin.

I agree with you.
We can easily see that Benjamin is trying to lower the threshold.
A special "bitlicense" means special offer.
But too many scammers/idiots are screaming "we don't need any regulation. If I rob you, just remember that's the rule of bitcoin world."
No, that's not the rule of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin can benefit this society hugely while not harming, that's why bitcoin has great value.

Protocol is Neutral.
it's not practical to expect protocol itself can solve all the potential problem.
My perspective is that Regulation is just the "natural" way you look forward to.
I totally agree with your opinion that " the bitcoin protocol isn't innately a bad thing just because scammers exist."
The scammers only hinder bitcoin from going mainstream and benefiting the society, and stole the money that would have been used to promote bitcoin, and hurt innocent people.
Regulation can't remove "all" possibility of scamming, but, we still need police offices.

I appreciate your attitude, but it seems you don't know policies well.
Whether you see bitcoin as money or stock, then the exchanges itself is illegal under Existing laws. Because these exchanges don't satisfy the requirement of invest protection and so on.
Today New York proposed new regulation rulers, and these "specific to Bitcoin" policy is helping "good" bitcoin enterprise from the risk of violating  "existing laws". You see, existing laws are too ponderous to Bitcoin enterprises.
I want to ask those bitcoin enterprises who want no regulation: who give you courage to ask people to give btc and money to you when you don't satisfy any criteria of security and invest protect?

You said he has many Coins, can't you know the coins he invested are raised by others instead himself? It's not proper to say 'he certainly has many coins'.
Why many newbie give money/coins to him/bitfund.pe? The most important reason is 'he said he has many coins and has a history of gaining many coins through 'sell high buy low' and investing in stocks'. Funny?
'A bunch of schools'...... You are kidding? He is poor before bitcoin surges.
' 5% interest'..... Haven't you believed his words that he has more than 100,000 bitcoins? Then he need coins from others to lend? Communist?
Also, if he use others' coins to invest, then he can get very much himself if win, but others will lose all if invests fail. That's same as what Madoff did. Clearly you are not familiar with the difference between bank and Ponzi game.
Last, I have a significant investment on bitcoin too, and haven't run bitcoin company(have plan). I love bitcoin and respect Satoshi as as great a talent as Newton. That's the reason why I hate those fraud who do harm to the reputy of bitcoin. Now I write some of Li xiaolai's fraud in Chinese.
1. 常识: 李笑来以前是一名教托福的新东方公司员工，该公司教托福的员工普遍被灌输形成了随口吹牛的习惯，并且以之为荣。
2. 突然大肆鼓吹烤猫股票，那时5B，现在貌似0.05.
3. 联合杨**预售矿机，收钱到了约定时间迟迟不发货，然后只肯退55%。然后，李笑来竟然不承认自己参与合伙!
4....此人号称李大嘴, 吹得比谁都响。到处各种吹牛，不忍直视。以前在知乎被嘲笑走，现在又蹦出来了。一个百度百科页面也拿出来作为荣耀骗外国人，其实任何一个普通中国人都可以轻松开通自己的百度百科，只是大多数人注重隐私。

1. BTC China stops RMB deposit completely.
2. add a service of "bitcoin storage(free/no interest)."
3. add a transaction fee 0.3%
As a Chinese, I suggest you Don't trust any exchanges owned by Chinese.

@_date: 2013-12-21 19:40:44
Perhaps you misunderstood me.
I never delete post "after 1 hour".
When it has no enough evidence, it's called "rumor". That "rumor" has been believed or at least doubted by many Chinese, You can see price in China exchange plunge before mtgox today.
That's only information, you can believe it or not, I just share it, not creating it.

If both methods are not feasible, then the Chinese will have to shut down Bitcoin the platform.

The announcement is just an announcement, Gov officers can explain it quite different.
According to the actions the merchants take today, It can be said that purchasing goods using BItcoin is not permitted in China.
Certainly Chinese can buy/sell BItcoin easily but identified. Yes this action can protect investors, however, I doubt that one day Government can confiscate the amount of BItcoin you bought and were recorded.
Chinese will still buy bitcoins for the dream of getting rich, so the price possibly keep rising, but revolution in currency domain will be impeded.

Weibo is very popular, while douban is not so popular. And it's not right to believe who registered "tastebitter" is the same person that owns the same name of weibo.
If you can read Chinese you can find the label under her weibo name: a journalist.
Also, it's she who spilled out the news of stopping deposit and some other news in advance. And that's why Many Chinese believe it and that's I post it here and marked as "rumor".
Also, people hate her because her news made price plunge.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:44:24
China gov never say what they want directly, they always use some confiscated words to imply it. So, as to me, today's news is bullish.

I have told you, it's just a rumor by that journalist.
Just because you dislike it, then you defame me? 
All these information are real words spread among Chinese and have at least a little of credibility. If you don't like it you can just ignore it. But please stop lying、slander and offending me.
If you read all my posts, you can see How I expect bitcoin succeed. But you should know, all roads to success are tough.
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:55:23
I am Chinese, I know it better than you(sorry), and it's the exact reason why people feel panic. (I am not offending)

to confirm the status, I just reopen it and I find it works well. Also, you SHOULD NOT use the word "lies" so easily.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:39:32
what would you expect him to say? Immediately close the company and go home? No, he has raised transaction fees and wanna earn the last money. He has known there is no way to go on his business.
He has expressed the meaning clearly: he is despairing, and ask people to wait savior to change all things. 
However, there is no savior in China.

@_date: 2013-12-20 18:22:30
No, he doesn't worth any respect. He knew his business would go over, so he immediately charge a 0.3% fee without any notice, and reduce the withdrawal limit to only 10 btc per day.
According to Central Bank, deposit is disallowed for ever, and all money must be withdrew before 1/31/2014.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:17:50

Can't you recognize such clear Ponzi Game? Or can't you read English dude? I don't believe you are really unaware of that.
This guy Li xiaolai is poor himself, he just swindle from others as Madoff did.
If you are interested in other fraud he made in past six months, you can just search it.
Li xiaolai is infamous in China now.
If you are Chinese and still silly enough to trust this fraud guy, then Please provide our QQ, and I am glad to show you how low people rate him. If you can't read Chinese, you will have to think about the whole thing by yourself.
Also, We know Li xiaolai often uses many vests/accounts to prove that he 'indeed' has many coins but never provide any evidence, and to disguise his fraud by spamming in posts that cast doubt on him. Dude, I see you repost this reply, and if you are Li xiaolai itself, I want you to stop frauding. If you are not, then you are paying 'stupid tax' just as others said.

1. most Chinese who bought bitcoin don't know how bitcoin works and they even don't know how to withdraw bitcoin to another address. Also most Chinese trust the power of Government so they feel that bitcoin will die because of such actions. So they will sell bitcoins on China exchanges and withdraw money.
However, some others saw the big difference in price between bitstamp and Btc china, so they will buy it on China-exchanges and sell on bitstamp to earn money.
2.Yes it's safe, but I don't understand why you don't buy bitcoin and sell it on bitstamp now? the price in btc China is only $545.

It certainly is one ponzi game.
Li xiaolai is a infamous fraud in China. However, there are many fool believe the lies he said that he owns more than 100,000 of bitcoins. He said he only had hundreds 1.5 year ago, but via 'sell high, buy low' he said he now owns more than 100,000. Haha.
