lets see some nice panic selling down to 13 or low 14 - just in time for my gdax funds to clear tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:47:29
I have 0 income, but a lot of investments in traditional stocks. I made some mistakes day trading BTC recently, bought BTC up to 10 K then stopped. and traded the recent drops from 12-10 K to increase my holdings a meager .05 or so (not worth much in the scheme of things). 
**But I was under the impression that being exempt from capital gains because of low income only applies to long term capital gains, not short term** so...
1) if i have 0 income but may have gains from capital investments in the non-crypto market - I don't take profits and someone else manages my account but there could be taxes from reallocation of stocks - could I maybe stop being myself up for being stupid enough to realize gains through day trading? 
2) do realized capital gains count as regular income in the sense that they determine your tax bracket? 
- starting to get the hang of this, but have been freaking out / beating myself up for ruining all my potential gains by realizing profits just to buy back in 2 min later w/ a day trade in BTC. but if i have no job and 0 income and a stock portfolio that is rarely if ever realized, does that work in my favor?

to clarify, OP was saying that the *exchange* itself crashed at 20K not the price of bitcoin (which did *dip* as well) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:57:00
the price for 1 BTC on coinbase when you get to checkout is always a few hundred more than the price shown on the "ticker" in the main page of coinbase. they mark up their coins in addition to the fees they charge. used to think it was just the price moving quickly, but they charge a premium for convenience. 
if you want almost nominal fees transfer funds to gdax (same company as coinbase) and buy coins there. if you already knew this, disregard my comment, couldn't tell from your post and wanted to help you if you didn't know this yet. 
good luck 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:25:14
you pay for convenience on coinbase. took me too long to figure this out a year ago. by having a coinbase acct. you also have gdax which has no price inflation and laughably small fees (like 50 cents for 500 dollars of btc) you have to transfer funds to gdax to use it (no credit) via ACH bankt ransfer or wire. the former takes at least a week to clear. the latter (wire) is next day but can be tricky to get to work depending on your bank.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:50:26
what does this mean if you have no other income? say I realized (this is hypothetical with round numbers so I can understand) 5 K of profits from buying at 1 and selling at 6, then bought back in at 5 through a "Day trade" to increase volume of BTC - but I have 0 income to be taxed on otherwise - could you speculate as to which bracket i'd be in? 
It seems like an above comment is saying if you make a small amount via occupational income you might not have to pay? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:34:40
go to coinbase.com, set up an account, upload your ID, social, etc. 
go to gdax (same company as coinbase but hosts a more-legit exchange with comparably minute fees - coinbase charges a high premium for convenience) link your bank account to gdax. deposit a sum of money to gdax. if you use ACH transfer you'll wait at least a week. or wire and get it same day, if you can figure out how to wire from your bank. 
then: buy bitcoin - ideally in a dip. the waters are rough out there right now, many don't think this is sustainable. I think we'll see a nice correction tomorrow, but it could go either way. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:00:47
this is the best advice you've received so far. heed this wise man / woman's words 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:53:56
for coinbase? no - but if it's not supported in your country I don't think there's a workaround. it's not like you can just use a VPN because they make you put your license and id number, etc. in and they'll see your nationality 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:30:53
possible but not feasible / worth it unless you have enough coin to sell / buy back lower and make a profit that's worth the actual risk of fucking it up and having to by back higher. I've never done this successfully I just buy and HODL but after watching this dip I did transfer .05 btc to gdax incase it goes up and I want to try and do a buy / sell and make some money 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:30:50
interesting, that makes sense. I guess my thought was that when I send 1 ETH to binance it seems to always come thru as one "whole' ETH - but your explanation is helpful, thanks
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:53:12
that's good advice. probably safer than just guessing savings or checking, just wanted to get the transfer underway but don't want to lose it 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:16:26
I also have 0 fees sending ETH from GDAX to binance - I thought that's the point of not sending from CB to an exchange wallet, because the one time I did with LTC I got hit with fees. 
Is sending like that betw. exchanges different, in terms of fees, than sending to my ledger nano s? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:42:00
to clarify, no, you can't put it in a wallet until you receive it. also 100 dollars of BTC is nowhere near worth buying a hardware wallet. and if you don't know much about moving it around, etc. i wouldn't recommend a software wallet. just keep it on coinbase until you have a substantial amount 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:31:31
it's been there a long, long time actually. not there for other coins though, yet, would be useful
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:51:44
thanks a ton - i know i have to do my own research, but ripple is one I keep hearing about, I think that's a good starting point because of low entry and potential for rise. probably going to try on binance because I went to the trouble to verify, but if poloniex has better fee's i'll switch over. I have a chunk of ETH and wish I got more when it was at 300 for months, but i was focused on BTC - of course, I agree its undervalued and will likely see 600 soon so I will pick up more ETH as well 
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:13:29
I appreciated this comment, but I am kind of hoping I appreciated it because it was accurate. I have all my coins (eth, btc, and lite) on coinbase - I started buying in early July I think right during / before the big boom. 
I have known the inherent risk of having them on an exchange, but have been ok with it within the context of accepting those inherent risks. **Now there is a new *apparent* risk, as shown on this subreddit with some saying coinbase may or may not honor:**
** A) **  their announcement that they will split all BTC into an equal amount of post-fork coin after the upcoming fork. 
** B) ** the protection of your OG BTC at all if you keep it on there - in other words, people are saying they will "honor' and maintain coinbase balances as given coins depending on whichever coin prevails after the fork - i'm not familiar enough / knowledgeable in cryptos in general to phrase this more effectively. 
maybe you can help me out with any of these statements and speak to their potential truth or lack thereof? i'd be extremely thankful
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:05:13
coinbase is insured by the FDIC for up to 250 K per user - and most of their coins are kept in cold storage. sure, anything could happen, but for someone messing around with 50 dollars, not sure buying a hardware wallet that is going to cost at least a few times their 50 dollar buy in is worth it. especially considering the highly unlikely nature that anything will happen to their funds.

I was coming to the defense of the friendly person (OP) - I couldn't give less shits about your opinion, was just eloquently calling you out for being a shitty person, something you further illustrated in this subsequent comment, while simultaneously making yourself look retarded by not being able to read that my account username was not the same as OP's. I've screenshotted this interaction so I can hold it over your head in future interactions and / or broadcast how A) mean-spirited and B) retarded you are :) :P :D
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:33:02
I'm hoping it'll correct at some point. I have .1 to go until I reach a certain club I want to be a part of. 
I saw that it would cost me around 500 to get that .1 a few days ago, when it was around 8100 at the moment, I figured 8.1 was unsustainably too high too fast and I'd have a chance. Also I've been waiting for GDAX funds to clear to avoid coinbases annoying fees, now that .1 will cost me like 900 :/. Still, it could go either way - IMO there WILL be a correction, but in this bull frenzy market mindfuck of the last month it could continue to rise and smash resistance levels and never go that low again (barring extreme scandal or issue) 
If it makes a dash for 10K I dont know if I'll bite the bullet and pay the likely 150 in fees to buy 1 K + of bitcoin on coinbase, or if I'll hope again that it will "correct" or crash. Either way I'll have my gdax funds in a few days :(  :) crazy times
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:19:02
I have to remind myself to be thankful in that regard. For a convergence of factors I have had the money to play around a bit. I could have gone much more heavily in (greater risk) and realistically been fine, considering my non-crypto portfolios and my age, but it would have felt bad to lose a large, large amount of money. Either way, I'm around 8 K invested at this point across BTC, ETH, and LTC and I know it could all go 0. 
It would suck, and I'd feel shitty having my pops know, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. That again, reemphasizes the point that you **shouldn't ever invest money that you can't afford to lose** 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:05:41
I (perhaps foolishly) kept them on CB. Many will say "never keep anything on an exchange unless you're day trading, which I have not ever done (day traded, that is). That said, some people will say (and I believe this more-moderate advice to be superior) that if you are unsure at all about how to manage a software or hardware wallet (not going near a software wallet because I don't trust the integrity of my computer to survive for too much longer and I might lose my phone) then you might be better off keeping on an exchange while you start out. 
It's only recently that my investments have gotten to the point where it's time to transfer, and I now know how to send funds with confidence. It's not tricky, but my time was spent doing other research not related to executing sends, etc. IMO coinbase is a huge, huge company, with a pretty good reputation, a fair degree of insurance - USD stored on coinbase is FDIC insured up to 250 K, though I never have kept large amounts of fiat on there anyway. If someone gets your password or hacks into your devices in any way, you could be screwed. 
I hope this makes sense and I'm running out of energy to type long messages out. 
For hardware wallet, I actually just bought a few days ago and transferred them over, so now they're totally safe. I didn't put too much thought in, but I bought the leger nano s because when it generates keys, it has its own screen built in, so you don't have to worry about your computer being secure from keyloggers because the info never displays on your computer itself, but on the device. Then it just uses a chrome app and you send the coins (carefully! double check the wallet addresses, etc. from **GDAX** so you don't get feed! to the wallet. it can store all the coins I have ETH, LTC, BTC, and is simple to use. It also has a recovery key which is literally a means of recovering all your coin wallets and the coins - pretty impressive. 
good luck 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:02:53
can you link me to info citing these purchases? i'm not questioning that it's true - i just want to learn more / show my dad who works at a similar firm and who i've been talking to about crypto for a while to ease his skepticism. just got him to buy 10 litecoins and would like him to buy bitcoins but it's more cost-prohibitive at this point. he obviously has the money to buy a lot of them but as a financial advisor, all his stuff is diversified in traditional funds as it's the safe way to do things. 
part of me would love him to be able to invest and maybe retire a bit earlier 
**edit: i know you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin - I phrased it that way to illustrate the psychologically prohibitive nature. in other words, you're not going to make substantial money without putting in a chunk of cash. compared to getting in "early" with ETH, LTC - which IMO could / will blow up any time soon and go on a big bull run. in which case, it's not hard to buy 15-20 LTC or 5-10 ETH now, with the hope of substantial gains.**
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:49:52
damn that "mmmhmmm. ok" is such a bad look. would make anyone seem unbearable but your other comments seem to suggest a trend of agreeability (or lack thereof) that defines your interactions with others.

no problem. i'm by no means an expert and though I've learned a lot in the months I've been doing this - i can say with certainty that you'll find more-detailed and more helpful / reliable / safe information and directions with some very simple key word searches in google, followed by "r/bitcoin" regarding exchange usage, hardware and software wallets, etc. if every newcomer spent 20 minutes doing things like that then this sub would be a lot more efficient and there'd be a lot less grouchy vets shutting well-meaning (but perhaps lazy) newcomers down for asking questions that are answered in the sidebar, FAQ, etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:49:19
there aren't really brokers yet. after writing a few sentences, I will copy and paste a comment that I wrote a few weeks ago that got the most upvotes I've ever gotten on reddit. I just repeated conventional investment advice and stuff I learned on this thread, but the hive mind seemed to approve it. 
**in short, without going into detail specifically, because its 2 AM where I am, the question you asked suggests you have minimal knowledge of the workings of crypto / bitcoin in general and while that doesn't preclude you from investing, it's an extremely loaded question that gets asked here 15 times a day (if not more) and won't prompt friendly / helpful responses in all likelihood.**
blanket comment in question for you to read to understand why I wrote what I wrote above: 
this gets asked a lot - it's either responded to with helpful, broad, and / or informative advice about investing in general, dollar cost averaging, not investing what you can't afford to lose, holding longterm eliminating the need to time the market, etc. or it's met with curt, impatient, and sometimes hostile replies that don't help much.
I guess that could be said for any question that is asked often, to a group of people who can't provide a definitive answer, because one does not exist.
Whether you should invest depends on your financial situation, your goals, how long you want to hold, etc. There will likely be a time, perhaps not in the immediate future (1-3 months) where bitcoin drops to half its current value for a short period, assuming the unlikely event that so much institutional interest and public support arrives so as to secure the price at a stable level for a long time. even then, trends change and burn out, technology improves or re-focuses, and competitors squeeze out old-time "first to market" products.
In other words, no one knows. IMOpinion You're better of getting your foot in the door with small amounts now (yesterday / last week / month / year in an ideal world - " best time to invest was 2013, second best time to invest is today, blah blah") and then learning the general trends and dip / boom cycles and just general practices surrounding trading.
Your course of action depends on how much you want to spend. But say you want to put 10 K in, I would (at a minimum) watch for a day or so and try to understand the "normal" price fluctuations when BTC Isn't either rising or dropping by thousands of dollars a day - this has been frequent in the past months.
Then maybe wait for a small dip, or wait for the next shit to stir and get in when it drops for a bit before (hopefully - it always has so far) shooting up again. 
That said, trying to time a dip to buy the bottom almost never works out perfectly. At the same time, it feels icky to buy at an ATH, which we're near right now (a couple hundred down from, so maybe there's your dip - who knows). My limited knowledge of how trading works would suggest that there's a sort of resistance at 8K where people aren't willing to pay above that yet - but a nudge in the news / big business / wallstreet, etc. could change that in just a few hours.
This isn't really getting anywhere but maybe it was helpful. I've only been trading since early August, in BTC, ETC, and LTC. Though I wish I had just gone in to buy a whole bitcoin (or 10) when they were still 2.5 K - but I was anxious to pull the trigger in that way, instead spacing it out over time. Sure, my decision was more responsible, but it stings to miss out.
Good luck. Read, research, try, fail, try again, don't act on impulse emotions or public fear mongering during sudden bear markets.

it's never too late. 
just some constructive criticism: 
do some more reading on everything - the technology, the terminology, trading (a lot of T's, I guess). the more you read the more fluid you will become with the terminology and expressing yourself in this subreddit and in general when discussing finance and BTC, etc. 
For example, your phrasing "I woulda made a lot of profit now" - I believe - is somewhat poorly phrased. Again, not trying to make you feel bad, I know you're writing informally and that's fine. But for an example, a "profit" is something that you actualize - if I buy 100 dollars of BTC and it goes up to being worth 200, then I have 100 dollars of **unrealized gains.** you don't "realize" the gain's and **make a "profit** until you sell the coins / shares in question. 
That's just one example and most of this is stuff that my dad has engrained in me. Another example being the term "investment" - when someone says "I'm going to invest in a new car, xbox 360, etc." they're using the wrong terminology - an investment is something that can *theoretically* yield a return. in theory, buying a classic car *could* be an investment, if it's value increases over time, that said, maybe cars are a bad example as their perfect examples of things that aren't investment - as they depreciate constantly as you own them. 
I won't go on too much now so I can keep this readable and concise. I'm only 22 and I got into BTC in July and would have killed to have gone all in then and made more gains. I would also have killed to have gotten in more when it was 500 and I used a fraction of a coin to buy something online. Anyway, you can't change the past, but you can educate yourself and move forward and hopefully **profit** off of the "money badger" that is BTC - and perhaps other cryptos as well. 
I have a lot to learn. My comment on language and phrasing is perhaps both a literal suggestion to read, learn, and improve your knowledge base - but also a metaphor for learning about BTC and the technology / trading in general. In other words, people will be more receptive to your requests for advice, and most importantly, they will be ready and willing to share and teach you more if you appear to be intelligent, well-spoken, and informed. It may seem shallow, but communication is important and in a way, BTC and blockchain technology is a form of communication in of itself. 
This might be getting too meta or out there and maybe this point is all moot and people will say my critique is offensive but I hope I made it clear that I don't mean anything that I just said to appear undermining and your post was still well thought out, thoughtful, friendly, and shows an eagerness to learn - which are all amazing things!
I wish you luck in your relationship with BTC going forward and feel free to PM me! I don't know much, but I can share what I know with the disclaimer that I could always been wrong or misguided. 
See you at the moon! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:06:31
i think it just means that some people think that post-fork, coinbase will designate whichever coin does better as the "true" bitcoin. this is just a naming thing, it won't affect your values of the two coins, just their labels. they're not going to take all your bitcoin and turn it into a coin worth less, they're going to split it into two coins

can't thank you enough, the positive feedback to this comment I left in passing really upped my mood. it's great to see this community equalizing after the nastiness we saw during the "attack" last week. 
i've never gotten 1/10th the amount of upvotes I got on this post, I can't believe it. like I said, I'm new to the game - just a 22 y/o recent college grad with a degree in fucking anthropology. my dad works with money though and I guess has taught me some stuff indirectly.

you're kind and respectful thanks means a lot - i don't always spend time writing out long things and at times i feel self absorbed speaking as if I know anything or much at all. i am suspicious of giving advice but try to when I feel I can without causing harm. 
it's oddly heartwarming when someone reciprocates with a genuine thanks and appreciation - brings me a sense of purpose and peace, i don't know - so please know that I appreciate your kindness and cordiality. feel free to PM me or ask more questions in this thread if you want others to be able to see, benefit, and perhaps learn the ropes of respectful conversation by witnessing our productive dialogue. i'm starting to sound self-righteous now but i'm kind of in this fluffy-style writing mood that your question got me into haha, so i'll cut myself off.

1) people will be here shortly to scold you for talking about what (if true) is an exorbitantly large amount of money, openly on the internet. i am not experienced enough to gauge the risks, but in theory, you expose yourself to people trying to get your BTC - unless you use a throwaway (not going to check if you are). 
2) there's a HUGE write up I just came across from a while ago, written by a tax lawyer, in this subreddit - which covers so many nooks and crannies of the tax issue when it comes to trading, selling, and buying crypto. 
IIRC, this write up was USA-centric, but I would hazard to guess that most of it is going to apply to you in canada. With some key word searches you'll quickly find this post I am referencing, and I am not exaggerating when I say that the OP of the post comments maybe 10-15 times to "amend" or add info regarding various sub-topics of the tax discussion, to me (someone unfamiliar with tax-related topics) it seemed very knowledgeable and comprehensive. 
In general, assuming you have the sum of money you say you do, whether "hackers" can track you down or not - I believe it was mentioned earlier that people have been killed and / or tortured over BTC / crypto, so you might want to be a bit more subtle next time you post about these topics. 
hope this was helpful

any input on some good alts to start with? part of what sucks is it seems you can only buy most alts with coins like Eth, BTC, or LTC and i'm fine buying those but don't wnt to use my current portfolio to do it so I have to buy more and then convert - been waiting on GDAX funds to clear for a week 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:37:07
This is a great post - obviously we all want this to be true. I was waiting to buy my last .1 BTC to get my whole BTC (started buying in june - conventional wisdom says its less risky to space out rather than go all in. Obviously if I put the money in all at once I'd have like 30 K but anyway - was going to buy the last .1 at 8200 but I have been waiting all week for funds to clear in GDAX 
didn't think this &gt; 9000 would stay, expected a dip / correction - still might happen, but im sitting here with my finger on the triger to buy the .1 on COINBASE (fees and all) for almost 1K just incase it clears 10. I know the adage about deferring buying to wait for dips that never come. 
my main point / question would be **I like the logic of your explanation of adoption and where we'll see the price go (few dips, steady rise, as we've been seeing - though it seems too good to be true and if I believed it 100 % I'd be buying a 2nd whole bitcoin for 9 K K right now. but in the USA, at least, this jump to &gt; 9k so late at night (1:35 AM for me) suggests that its the koreans waking up and buying, not americans trying to get their share and adopting. I dunno, I won't go on to explain that in better words, and I don't think that fact is mutually exclusive to your conclusions.** 
Anyway, thanks for your write up - still can't decide whether to go in or wait for a dip that will bring me not even down to where I was earlier when I was pissed that it was at 8.6 and I was too cheap to pay the fees at 8.2 because I missed the chance to just pay 500 at 7.8 -- aghhh

i hate bs too and i never post these circle jerk things (or post much at all) idk what compelled me to, today. sorry for the inconvenience. why do you think i should get "Sale" coins now - that suggests you think it will plow thru 10 K to new heights instead of consolidate / retrace / dip because of profit taking? not saying i disagree, my guess is as good as anyones, but would love to hear your rationale

@_date: 2017-11-02 04:18:11
you don't - it's a guessing game. there are theories and mathematical principles that allegedly can help to "predict" how things will go - but to my knowledge none of these are valid in every scenario. 
it helps to keep a close eye on economic news - specifically surrounding crypto and BTC-related legislation, government involvement, economic rulings, etc. other major world events are thought to have an impact - a war in South East asia could lead to rising bitcoin prices if large populations feel more comfortable storing their currency in a decentralized asset (BTC, for example). 
Chinese attempts to legislate or "ban" various coin exchanges, initial coin offerings (ICO's), etc. have been cited as reasons for several of the major dips in the past few months. These issues have resolved and the prices have risen intensely since, however, there will always be multiple volatile forces impacting the price of BTC. 
There is simply no way to know what the "top" is. I have only been doing this for several months, but it feels much longer for some reason. I bought in at the start of a bull market, I had my first bear run and lost interest when I *should have* been buying in at 2 K in august before its fucking tripled since then! 
So stick with it. I think what a lot of these comments are saying to you is that you should always HODL (hold - not sell) through the dips, because when looking at bitcoin's history since its creation in 2013 - the trend **in the long term** is always up. **This will likely NOT last forever** but no one actually knows! The thing is, for anyone who sold out of panic OR to turn a profit and realize their gains in the last years, they missed out on the insane price increases that we've seen in the past couple of months by giving up an asset that ultimately proved to be valued dozens of times more than it was when they sold at $100, or $500, or $2000, or $4000, etc. I mean, this damn thing just keeps going up. 
A lot of us (myself included) are waiting for the big crash / drop so we can buy in. But waiting itself has huge risks, too. It could go up and then stay up! These are unchartered territories at this point. If you told people in May that BTC would be nearing 7 K at this current date, many would probably have laughed. 
For me, I buy some now while its high (but not too much, so I don't lose my unrealized gains (just several K right now) when it goes down - I made that mistake last time and then was too weary to even buy the giant dip :(
Last thing as I need to stop typing now: first assignment should be to look up **dollar cost averaging** it's one way of more-securly buying into BTC or any other stock. Many argue it is the most safe / responsible, there's different theories and if you can, it's always good to buy the dips IMO. Problem is, you never know how low a dip will go, just as you never know how high BTC will go at any time and thus don't know when to sell (never sell though, unless you *need* the money - always HODL for the long run if you want to stay in and earning). 
**never invest what you can't afford to lose - there is ALWAYS a risk you will lose it all - and you won't have to worry about not eating / losing your house if things go upside down. In the scheme of things, that's probably the most important lesson**

i dunno I've only been part of this subreddit / crypto trading for a few months, but since the interest in BTC in general has increased this sub has gotten increasingly sour / hostile / vindictive. i'm not going to virtue signal or pretend like my values are better than yours, or that I don't ever leave a snarky comment. but put simply, comments like this make this sub an unpleasant place...
I know "who am I? why don't I leave? no one cares." well yeah - I know - but I like the information I can gleam from this sub to direct my purchases. 
that said, your comment makes you look like a shitty person, whether you care or not

this gets asked a lot - it's either responded to with helpful, broad, and / or informative advice about investing in general, dollar cost averaging, not investing what you can't afford to lose, holding longterm eliminating the need to time the market, etc. or it's met with curt, impatient, and sometimes hostile replies that don't help much. 
I guess that could be said for any question that is asked often, to a group of people who can't provide a definitive answer, because one does not exist. 
Whether you should invest depends on your financial situation, your goals, how long you want to hold, etc. There will likely be a time, perhaps not in the immediate future (1-3 months) where bitcoin drops to half its current value for a short period, assuming the unlikely event that so much institutional interest and public support arrives so as to secure the price at a stable level for a long time. even then, trends change and burn out, technology improves or re-focuses, and competitors squeeze out old-time "first to market" products. 
In other words, no one knows. IM*Opinion* You're better of getting your foot in the door with small amounts now (yesterday / last week / month / year in an ideal world - " best time to invest was 2013, second best time to invest is today, blah blah") and then learning the *general* trends and dip / boom cycles and just general practices surrounding trading. 
Your course of action depends on how much you want to spend. But say you want to put 10 K in, I would (at a minimum) watch for a day or so and try to understand the "normal" price fluctuations when BTC *Isn't* either rising or dropping by thousands of dollars a day - this has been frequent in the past months. 
Then maybe wait for a small dip, or wait for the next shit to stir and get in when it drops for a bit before (hopefully - it always has so far) shooting up again. That said, trying to time a dip to buy the bottom almost never works out perfectly. At the same time, it feels icky to buy at an ATH, which we're near right now (a couple hundred down from, so maybe there's your dip - who knows). My limited knowledge of how trading works would suggest that there's a sort of resistance at 8K where people aren't willing to pay above that yet - but a nudge in the news / big business / wallstreet, etc. could change that in just a few hours. 
This isn't really getting anywhere but maybe it was helpful. I've only been trading since early August, in BTC, ETC, and LTC. Though I wish I had just gone in to buy a whole bitcoin (or 10) when they were still 2.5 K - but I was anxious to pull the trigger in that way, instead spacing it out over time. Sure, my decision was more responsible, but it stings to miss out. 
Good luck. Read, research, try, fail, try again, don't act on impulse emotions or public fear mongering during sudden bear markets. 
**edit: holy crap - I've never gotten more than like 10 upvotes before. I'm just a 22 y/o college grad without a job and most of what I said has been taught to me by my father or this subreddit. I know upvotes are just upvotes but it made me feel good to see that I'm on the right track - I really didn't know if I was giving bad advice when I left this comment. not the emotional type (maybe I am) but this was pretty warming to see - thanks everyone**

I'm confused - am I mixing up forks? Wasin't 2x the fork that was supposed to happen on november 15th or so? 
I saw some post on the ETH subreddit about how the fork was cancelled? but having trouble getting a grip on what actually ocured today? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:06:28
I know. I've been trading for 6 months in ETH, LTC, BTC - and have substantial gains. I was asking OP for a source on the purchasing patterns of a large established financial firm

I'm excited as well. Thanks for writing out the math in those terms, helpful to see it laid out. After finally getting 1 BTC I don't know whether to direct my money more towards ETH and LTC and maybe finally get around to buying some "alts" like dash, ripple, OMG, etc. 
or keep buying into BTC which has made me the largest profits so far. there is certainly a psychological factor to be addressed now that 1 BTC costs almost 10 K - % gains are % gains so whether you invest 100 dollars, 500, 500, or buy the whole coin, if it keeps going up one will profit - I'm thinking of newcomers here

oh no - i'm so outraged at your callus disregard for conventional financial wisdom and action! better write up an angry comment to right your wrong thinking! /s troll for days buddy - go have a wank to release the stress / frustration that drives you to troll

if you have to ask this question you should read more about crypto in general and read the whitepapers (again look up what this means) before you jump into crypto purchasing. not saying this to be condescending but, for example, you should probably know that gdax and coinbase are the *same* company (coinbase inc.) and gdax is the more-advanced "true" exchange version of coinbase, which, in comparison, is the average-person-friendly version of an exchange. Hence, you pay a premium (inflated BTC prices and substantial fees) for the convenience they provide. 
Personally, as a "Trader" for 5-6 months now, I could not have gotten here without devoting myself to a lot of online reading, analysis, and reflection. I use coinbase, currently transferring to a hardware wallet for the first time now that I have a certain amount of coins and for 2 months now, having become sick of coinbase fees, logged into my gdax account (if you have a coinbase account you *automatically* have a gdax account - they make it very easy!). Then, you transfer funds from your bank to gdax (takes a week so initiate asap and plan ahead so you have your almost fee-free funds ready when that dip comes) and buy you stuff on gdax and transfer to coinbase (again, no fee to transfer out and takes 20 seconds to complete). *then* transfer to a personal wallet. personally, I have a good amount of faith in coinbase, but hacks happen and with hundreds of thousands of new users in the last few weeks, you should do you due diligence. 
if you want a more-general set of advice that I have amassed from conventional investment wisdom passed down to me from my dad, and (primarily) basic, but **crucial**, and somewhat obvious (but often overlooked) crypto purchasing / investing advice, check my comment history and you'll find my most-upvoted comment ever from a few weeks back, that I wrote in response to someone asking the question that gets asked 15 times a day (more now that all the noobs are flocking to this sub). nothing wrong with being a noob, but a lot of people expect more info than "experts" on this sub can reasonably provide (they're not psychics - no one can predict the market) - anyway, the question was "should I invest in bitcoin right now, or will it drop tomorrow" if you can't see why this is a loaded and silly question, you still have more primary research to do. anyway, that comment in question I will not take the time to go find and paste here, but I don't comment much on reddit, so you can find it easily, I think.
Best of luck, I hope this was helpful - remember, the honos is on you to do the footwork to get to the point where you can get started, find success, AKA unrealized gains, and then, perhaps, get to the point where you can ask reasonable questions on this subreddit and perhaps even lecture / correct (respectfully) those who come here to ask questions that can't really be answered. 
**edit** I thought you were OP but you're not - so this doesn't really apply to you but will probably be helpful to your both - anyway, just disregard anything I said that's not applicable to you**
