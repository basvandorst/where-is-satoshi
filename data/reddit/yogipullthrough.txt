Anybody knows what issues prevent us from having LN today ?
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:43:51
Could it be an attack to raise difficulty from bcashers ?

@_date: 2018-01-08 06:47:41
yea poloniex is still no segwit. They used to be the first to support new features/alts, now they are dropping balls, allowing binance bittrex to shine. I'm disappointed.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:49:03
Bitcoin core and airgap the shit. Be your own bank. When the next trazor is discovered, they'll say go to Nano, then when Nano drops ball, they'll recommend KeepKey. If you stick with Core, keep it cold airgapped, when issues raise you can follow instructions and fix your own, not having to beg for hardware wallet provider mercy

TA . We are waiting for segwit &amp; LN adoption lowering tx fee. Once it happens, we moon, if not, we choke
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:30:54
That's 5 months from now. If full segwit support is ready and we badly need it, wouldn't make sense to release it as soon?

What does all this mean
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:17:12
I guess somebody already paid for it at the time it was cheap. But this case doesn't happen a lot, so coinbase decide to eat the loss. I'm just pointing out a way to exploit coinbase. For example, you sell, the price rise significantly before ach is done, you go the bank to close or freeze account, then you win.
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:21:57
Nice. Let's keep squeezing Jihan ball

Don't run LN nodes more than you can afford to lose

Which airdrops are we talking, I know byteball is lazy, not even bother supporting segwit with the 3... address, the payout is peanut but for guys with 1000+ btc can fund a few trips to africa

well, Last time I sold at coinbase, I accidentally sold it to a closed bank account. CB said it's going to take 7 days. Yet I still did not notice my mistake. Then price rose sigificantly (6000...). After the failure to ach into my account. Coinbase credited it back in term of bitcoin, but I couldn't send that out because there's no bitcoin I guess, however I was able to resell it with that current price to a valid bank account. I guess coinbase just ate that loss
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:22:07
Just HODL it

The first Usd exchange that has LN enabled will become the next CB
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:06:35
Can you support multisig on GUI? It's one of those features that hodlers really want but will not be available anytime soon
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:36:20
Ah, no, Fellow Binancians,
Due to the overwhelming surge in popularity, Binance will have to temporarily disable new user registrations to allow for an infrastructure upgrade. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Next one, before 0.16.0 ad soon as it's ready. Keep an eye on this 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:32:03
they can wish. They ripped out segwit, they can no longer benefit from future techs.
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:32:48
Can we just file complaint to CFPB
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:42:52
Fee pressure is already fueling the adoption. They said LN has to wait for 2 years to be usable. I'm pretty sure it will be here in 6 months at this rate.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:22:17
One important reason I hodl despite knowing it's crashing is I don't trust exchange for tons of coins. I guess other hodlers feel the same, so we never sell....

No they need segwit change address which core will have it on next release.  although they can get around it, most big exchanges are saying nah, we rather wait for core

@_date: 2018-01-08 05:08:16
with an online line machine, of course, then the airgapped machine can use the synced blockchain shared thru usb. Then use usb, or QR send out raw tx to an online machine. There are still some attacking vectors for sure but rational hackers will target those weak preys first before attempting on airgapped folks
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:24:25
r/Bitcoin has to establish one to protect the interest of the sub

@_date: 2018-01-16 07:48:29
there're bgold, diamond, super bitcoin, byteball and many more... be sure to claim the shit out of them
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:24:09
They won't because segwit is their whole point of bcash. The thing is while they can't have segwit and the rest of tech, we will definitely have blocksize increase in the distant future. It's been calculated in the paper that even we have LN, we still needs to increase that size to serve everybody on earth. And it will make bcash like a temporary solution 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:14:07
well, all eyes are waiting for segwit adoption and LN. It will take a while until next rally
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:33:15
Winning coinbase is not difficult. When circle came out, coinbase was literally replaced until they went nutjob. Coinbase still drop balls in a few states like HW, NY, I guess some big fish  who know what they are doing can eat cb pie. The reason cb is so big is there is no competition

Yes i visited Yerevan, can confirm Armenian is crazy of btc
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:31:24
Yes, but coinbase make it work, isn't there a way for bisq to get around it? Maybe clvt coin lock for a week with another arbitrator to revert it, or some sort of smart contract simplicity, rootstock, come on there must be a way
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:52:21
I thought Karpeles is still in locked up
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:32:54

Damn. Can't argue with moon math 
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:44:51
Rsk is available now. We might be able to use it as a temporary solution. Its kinda like Offchain 
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:13:05
Well, coinbase works in Android, bisq doesn't 
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:41:32
For that rat trailer? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:41:31
Yeah, chase, coinbase, citibanks, any financial services starting with C should probably be avoided. They're likely the bad guys
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:21:47
and it's going quick because people use it to buy bitcoin more and more while hodling the debt
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:15:54
Tldr; Just HODL it

If LN is integrated into existing wallets, how would it look like? Such as electrum. For example will it have a separate set of LN addresses etc?

Nah, that's what we call diversifying

Which world? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:22:02
Wait, can a website scan and communicate with opening ports in local? Sounds like it can attack many other things besides electrum 
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:39:50
ByteBall ??
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:50:01
This is good. So everybody has to push LN the real solution. Back in the day, m$/steam accepted btc was like novelty adoption, nobody really relied on paying with btc in the first place. Blockchain tech is never going to be easier than CC, admit it. Now LN can have another good shot to make it economic sense to pay with btc.

@_date: 2018-01-09 23:26:00
sure, but it's easy to compete with coinbase, LN wised. Because one just needs to have a lot of capital as anybody can be hub. Rumor has it that the Draper bought a lot of bitcoin to be one of the biggest hub as well, then there are bitpay, wallst, whaleclub, chinese..
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:38:25
Like he said, but even it still has some attacking vector but it will be really unlikely that coins in airgap machine will be stolen before others
