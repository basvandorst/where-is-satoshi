On what are you basing these expectations of greater volatility (in the thousands)? Serious question. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:42:41
How about some details or a link?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:02:59
Can you explain in more detail or point me to more info on that last part?
If I understand you, one can file for a refund in a year there is a capital gains loss AND claw back taxes paid 3yrs back and 17 years forward?

Congrats! And +1 for the immense generosity in your heart.
Side question: How did you manage your tax obligations for the BTC you’ve liquidated?

Read this. And dollar cost average.

Can you ELI5 how LN and subchains will allow more fraud? Is there not a means for securing a subchain with the main Blockchain during the transaction? Merkle tree?

Warren Buffet famously quipped his "favorite holding period is forever". Worth considering.

Did you end up resolving your issue?

You like trying to catch falling knives?
If your goal is to occupy your time and add unnecessary stress to your life, then yes.
If your time horizon is long-term and you don't have a crystal ball, it may be worth it to consider the buy/hold strategy.

This is called spoofing: placing limit orders and cancelling them before they execute. It is considered market manipulation and is illegal in regulated markets.

How long did it take?
I have a stuck transaction myself (unconfirmed &gt;7 days)
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:57:29
Mining dropped 50% in the last few days? How? What is the story behind that?
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:57:41
Can you ELI5 how SegWit and Lightning &amp; Co. will solve those problems?
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:54:23
What are you basing this off of?
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:34:48
Escalator up.
Elevator down.

This. I'd like to have someone knowledgeable explain how BTC, ETH, and a slew of other coins are SIMULTANEOUSLY rising.
Also, since BCH isn't based on a Gold Standard: the devs just created an alt, gave everyone BCH who had BTC, now they've created all this market cap, now it's dropping, people are exchanging for BTC and there's suddenly MORE BTC market cap?
1+1 != 2, it apparently equals something more. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:32:26
Why'd you decide with linear regression?
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:46:19
What did you do that was immoral?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:50:08
Thanks! Where would you find this information to make a valuation like this?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:18:48
There are plenty of exchanges that have quick deposit confirmations. There are coins that confirm transactions remarkably quickly.
There are lots of ways to address your parameters without constantly keeping capital at risk.
