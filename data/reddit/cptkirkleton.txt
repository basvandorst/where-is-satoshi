Its because the memes weren't dank enough after 9k. The world is telling us to meme better this time.

You can't tell me this isn't entertaining as hell right now. Stupid GDAX wouldn't let me buy until it was back above $16k tho :/

I would hope not, but most people are hilariously bad with money.

Can we reasonably now assume that people cashing out for Christmas was a big part of that dip?
Also, Christmas $$$ should mean lots of new buyers?

The more popular bitcoin and alts become, the more ridiculous shitposting and terrible opinions you're gonna read on here. I miss the dank memes

ITT: Guys can you tell me exactly low this will go?
Yes it will be precisely $4,719.49 on January 3rd of next year at 12:56am. Prepare accordingly.

If BTC and ETH could drop about 90% just for today, that would be greaaaaaat.

Is everyone having fun yet?! All the excitement of a real rollercoaster, except you don't know if you'll be ok at the end or not! Woooooooo

Quick guys sell, it'll be 0 by the end of the day. *5 minutes later* HODL to the moon! 
people here are special

Watching the depth chart is like a goddamn chess match. And i love it.

For most people that got in early, this represents a significant part of their net worth and is likely the first time they've had this much invested in one particular thing. Which can be very scary for new investors
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:04:14
If any of you are really truly scared about what is happening right now then just put a stop loss order in and leave it alone for like a week. Don't even look at it. You'll be better off that way

Yall got some more of that insider trading? Id like to buy more at 14k plz :)
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:04:40
Kinda glad i stopped looking at the price daily. Knowing im just going to hodl and let it do its thing for a long time is more comforting.

ITT: Once Bitcoin breaks X, it's going to X! I have no basis for this, but it WILL happen!
Same person last month: Once it falls to X, it's straight down to X! It's all over!
