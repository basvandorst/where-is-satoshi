@_date: 2016-08-01 12:45:08
Same. While i like it, i don't see the point if you already use ad-blockers on chrome for example. On the other hand, im really excited to see how btc is integrated. 
@_date: 2016-04-16 04:19:02
I'm so excited that banks can now save even more money and use interoperable blockchains to settle among themselves! The people rejoice!

If EU customers begin to fear that it will affect their deposits, then yes. It would also boost cash hoarding and buying crypto.

@_date: 2016-04-15 06:49:33
Find a person who would give you btc for your cash (at a meetup, localbitcoins, a friend of a friend etc.). It's the most anonymous way possible.

people cannot spend on goods and services in Russia since businesses cannot accept btc by law. So i presume btc is being bought with (volatile) rubles as a store of value.

1. Download a mobile wallet
2. Find the nearest BTM (daily price moves makes the high fees point moot) 
3. You have bitcoin without AML/KYC bs

herd mentality. People will only start buying once the hype train takes off (like in 2013)
@_date: 2015-12-03 11:36:22
buying bitcoin is essentially 'buying shares' in the Bitcoin network

U can say the same thing about automobiles too. Without supporting infrastructure, roads, fuel, repair shops, etc. they are pretty worthless as well. The network affect i.e. adoption is what will, and already has made, Bitcoin valuable.

@_date: 2015-09-07 13:37:33
Awareness will always increase since cryptocurrency cannot be uninvented. Digital infrastructure can be leapfrogged and black-swanned at a blink of an eye in today's world. So imo Bitcoin's network effect is its biggest advantage now, but Myspace was in the same position in '04 and we saw what happened. 
Still long on BTC tho :)

id imagine the property is linked to your real life identity and recorded on the blockchain. Amiright?
@_date: 2016-10-11 14:07:37
yea i don't see the utility of it except in name only but good luck!  
@_date: 2016-10-23 18:42:45
yep. As stated, they include the recovery sheet to write it down in the box as well. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:15:04
No. That's only in a Mt Gox scenario where peoples' private keys of  are controlled by a third party (counterparty risk). In the bitcoin world, there is one simple rule: never expose your private keys and your coins will be safe. 
This is why hackers target ...well Target, i.e. big honey pots that stores personal and credit info on millions of people.

you mean like intranets and Internet "e-companies"? 
@_date: 2015-11-27 08:29:25
BBF changed their approach this year, only targeting credible merchants and focusing on Bitcoin users and their needs.

So this allows you to spend money from an uphold account directly? both fiat and crypto?

original source (IBTimes) took down the article. May have been retracted. False news?

good luck vultures

def a grain of truth there though

when I say growth, I mean it in how our global economy views it. Increased production + consumption
@_date: 2015-10-06 09:21:00
it belongs to Janet Yellen
@_date: 2016-10-07 17:25:25
it's actually less than 5% 
@_date: 2016-10-31 08:04:13
having such a bottlenecked release plays into the hype. Might be an interesting emission strategy going forward though the crash in the price is to be expected. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 11:14:39
why u no go to moon!!!?!?!?
@_date: 2015-10-07 06:55:26
while in theory he's prob right, i doubt fold could support that kind of volume right now if you know their business model
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:08:09
it shouldn't be regulated as anything. it's a medium of exchange. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 07:42:26
@_date: 2015-11-20 12:24:17
restrict fiat-crypto-fiat conversions, shut down exchanges, brand users as criminals. 
Bitcoin will continue to chug along though.

Maybe Australia will then be buying bitcoin from public instead.

My market cap is 4 times that of Onecoin. See I can make up facts too. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 09:43:12
I beg to differ. It "died" over a hundred times every time there was a price drop. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 14:03:20
no it doesn't

like the mafia shooting someone in broad daylight, the ruthlessness of Ulbrich's sentencing was to send a message.

@_date: 2015-03-24 10:00:26
bans can only affect the on/off ramps vis-a-vis the fiat monetary system. The govt cant really stop its citizens from conducting P2P transactions similar to how they can't stop P2P file sharing.

no it's this: 
@_date: 2015-10-16 17:28:10
it's a sign that the global economy is tanking, i think there's a correlation here....public confidence in the financial system etc. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 07:50:45
yea, i've come to the realization that only a good ol' financial crash will be what propels bitcoin into the mainstream.

yea the fees are high but that's negligible price worth paying for anonymity and considering the price volatility 
@_date: 2016-05-30 13:10:19
Don't the Chinese have a 50k annual cap on how much money they can move out of the country? Easy conversion to foreign fiat can't solve this problem.

In other words, KYC/AML used as justification to deanonymize users at on-ramps. What else is new? 
@_date: 2015-02-04 12:18:47
they wouldn't. The currency would be worth zero as one person would have all the (worthless) coins. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 18:24:48
