I think you just hate John Oliver, for no real tangible reason.

Well that was a lie, they are an INVESTOR for the company that owns the boat. They can’t control per se what the company does. Let’s hate on them for the stuff they actually do instead of stuff they haven’t done

100% JP is bad morally, but like it or not fiat currency ain’t going anywhere. My point is attack them for what they actively do wrong, not for things they can’t directly control.

Depends on your portfolio, if you’re building an individual stock portfolio that is pretty low. If you’re building a Fixed Income through US treasury bonds 1% over 6 months after paying Local and State taxes on it seems reasonable

I get it isn’t mostly about bitcoin, but I want to discuss a potential strategy for college savings. I currently have a 529 account (USA), and would like to go to graduate school. Is it possible to avoid CGT for BTC by using the funds for education, is it possible to integrate BTC directly into different federal college saving accounts?

Yes you don’t have a wallet, and you don’t have keys or anything like that. But it’s reliable because a) it’s super easy to use, anyone can grasp the concept in 5 minutes. Plus it’s a point of entry to getting more into cryptocurrency. 
If your whole goal is mass adoption, you need to start slow. These exchanges (if you really can call them that) are simply making it easier for average joes to start looking at crypto as a real thing not “magic internet money”

That is fair, but for intro users, it’s a safe and reliable point of entry.

You should use Robinhood instead of Cash App. It has lower transaction fees.

No offense but that’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard, fiat Currency is very important and don’t take financial advice from a reddit comment.

Shoot man, that sucks
