He is right sir.

Your BTC maximalist delusion? Of high fees are for security and BTC is gold 2.0? Please... nobody wants to spend BTC, merchants accept more ETH and BCH payments than BTC.

Have you seen the amount of node tezos has?

hold on. The device is always connected to the internet, after placing your passphrase brain wallet and sending a transaction wouldn't that be a breach too? There is no Sign offline transaction?  I can't seem to find anything about that.

In fact, the reason bitfi has for you to believe that is more secure than a trezor or ledger, is the fact that trezor stores private key inside the device, but that reason is immediately discarded by the fact that ledger and trezor offers the passphrase solution... So there's is absolutely NO reason to buy a BITFI hardware hot/brain wallet.

no, its not. In trezor or ledger, the device is never connected to the internet. Therefore the private key is never exposed to the internet. In Bitfi wallet, the key is exposed by a few milliseconds long enough for someone to steal your keys. IS true ledger or trezor store the seed inside the device and someone can physically open the device an extract the private key. That's why trezor and ledger offers the passphrase option, so if someone extracts somehow the private key, the attacker will still need the passphrase to get into your accounts. If the trezor or ledger seed has 24 words, the passphrase is the word number 25... and that word in NOT stored in the device, it should be stored in your brain only. Setting up a passphrase is the best security practice and makes virtually impossible for someone to steal your funds, unless you choose a low entropy passphrase and the attacker already knows your 24 seed. So it makes no sense for someone to buy a Bitfi wallet if is going to be less secure than a trezor, and practically is a hot/brain wallet.

This is what worries me, the tiny little fraction of a second that the private key exists. 
  
" simply, there isn’t anything to hack. Our patent pending technology is a giant leap in security because unlike all other existing wallets, your private key is never stored anywhere, ever. It is calculated by the powerful CPU on your Bitfi device at the time that you enter your secret phrase and only exists for a fraction of a second, just long enough to approve and sign a transaction. The powerful CPU is able to calculate even the very complex Monero private key in under 20 seconds."
