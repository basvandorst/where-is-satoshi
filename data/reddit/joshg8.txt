A rabid fan-base?

Binance (appropriately) locked his account because the phisher was attempting to log in to his account.
The phisher then posed as Binance offering to help him unlock his account and was able to successfully get 5 identifying documents from OP.
In a stroke of ironic luck for OP, this shitstorm he kicked up by blaming Binance may be the one thing that prevents the phisher from being the one who successfully unlocks/retrieves the account since it's now so hot.

A few things:
- OP never mentions 2FA, I can't say whether or not he had it obviously, but never mentioning that he did or didn't get such notices leads me to believe he didn't have it activated.
- OP posted a single email header which smarter people than me have deduced is probably actually from Binance. Subject line: "Unusual Login Attempts". So 2FA or not, someone was trying to get into his account.
- OP has not once disclosed how much crypto he has/had on the exchange, only that his verification level *allowed* the withdrawal of "over 100 BTC per day." He actively dodged questions about how much he had on there. I think it's safe to assume that he did not have anywhere near 100 BTC.

That's standard practice for any reputable agency or shelter. $400 is way above average, at least on the east coast.

Yes, I said immediately, and explained why that matters pretty clearly, you're not proving me wrong by saying what I said.
The issue present at this moment in time, as others have pointed out, is that when buying things with Bitcoin the Bitcoin rarely stays as Bitcoin.
1 Euro is 1 Euro, so spending the Euro you traded USD for doesn't involve a gain.
Things you can buy with crypto, from my experience, have sharply fluctuating crypto prices because they're trying to make it a stable amount of state-backed currency, meaning that 1 BTC = 1 BTC isn't really a valid argument because practically nobody treats it like that when it comes to pricing goods and services in BTC. Hell, even in the purely blockchain world of mining 1 BTC doesn't equal 1 BTC as the transaction fees for satoshis/byte fluctuates over time with the value of BTC.

Can I ask what about my opinion on the difference between spending a state-backed currency vs. spending BTC leads you to that incorrect conclusion?
I paid capital gains tax for the first time for the 2017 tax year after making a profit on crypto trades, including both fiat--&gt;crypto--&gt;fiat and fiat--&gt;crypto A--&gt;crypto B--&gt;crypto A.
I have never held a foreign currency so maybe I was wrong when I said "spending the Euro you traded USD for doesn't involve a gain" but in fairness you are the one that posited that first.

Oh yeah, much better to be at the mercy of exploitative capitalists than a centralized government.  The Libertarian Dream^^TM

I've bought things online in foreign currencies plenty of times, but I fail to see how this applies at all.
Example: I buy an article of clothing from England priced in GBP.  I only have USD in my accounts. I process the transaction through PayPal or my credit card.  PayPal/my bank does the currency conversion.
I never held any GBP, and the USD I spent was converted to GBP by the payment processor.  
The misconception I'm poorly trying to point out is that you don't have to pay capital gains tax just because you used Bitcoin. If you bought the Bitcoin and then immediately used it to buy something, there would be no gains realized because there would be no gains present.
Just using Bitcoin doesn't constitute capital gain, it's the fact that it's worth more than when you bought it.
The two sides of your argument aren't in parallel, unless you're saying that you already had the Euro because you exchanged USD for Euro previously and the Euro has since gone up in value against the dollar.  In this case I can *kinda* see what you're getting at but I still think it's intellectually dishonest to say that any crypto is or should be treated equivalent to a state backed currency.

Because "taxation is theft" is such an independent thought.
