Check your surroundings you are probably working in a technological field or are surrounded by people who are tech savvy/good with money. 
At my job ain't nobody even give a freak about cryptos except me and the IT guy
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:09:27
I bought some at $600 remembering the $1000 gold rush. Then it dropped to $400 quickly and I shit my pants. 
Had I hodled.... Best time to buy some was back then, next best time is today.

@_date: 2018-01-11 04:28:04
I hope they fund how to fix brains from mdma use because mine is mashed potatoes. All thanks for btc and the dnm's and my lack of self control ;)
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:23:33

Huddle to your coins!!!
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:17:45
I'd hop in the car and drive around the United States to see the whole country, it might be a pain in the ass to get oil changes on a Lamborghini though... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:23:30
Well I have an E55 AMG right now so I think I would make a young car enthusiast very happy until their first repair comes along. 
And with the Lambo I'm going to live out my childhood dreams.

Coinbase is the devil 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:35:53
Don't fuck you. It'll come back up, relax. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:33:10
I know better now 
Buying like we are gonna run out 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:18:04
Just last week it dipped from 18k to about 13.5 or so... be confident :) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:33:12
Fuck Coinbase
I have been banned for a number of years now and I can't figure out why. Glad they're getting hate finally!
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:16:40
Just keep hodlin till 2019.

HODL ON TO YOUR SHIT BOYS AND GRILLS
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:19:13
Not much there, just to have a fast car.. which I ended up buying in April by working very hard (in high school, college, and at my job). 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:25:37
Well you can always share ya know, one man's marshmallow is another man's dinner
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:10:28
what do you guys think of exodus?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:18:33
Gemini is the shit. After coinbase banned me Gemini and Kraken were my only options. GEMINI I CHOOSE YOU!
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:36:49
Why would I give away my btc tho.... this isn't trickle down cryptonomics... are we still talking about marshmallows?
Hodling cryptos is harmless. Hodling marshmallows... they'll go bad, you'll get ants in your pocket, it's a whole lot of hassle
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:02:59
Every day I move $500 to my gemini account. .
Anybody know why my chase account won't get approved for wiring money directly? I can't figure out how to wire otherwise... It's been a good 2 months since I applied..
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:53:48
calm down you baby
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:37:28
Remember folks, if you advise people to sell you're not helping anything. Don't be a part of the problem, hodl
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:46:50
Whatever makes you feel better for getting only one marshmallow. You can always save the second one for later.
And if the person doesn't deliver on the two marshmallows? BIG FUCKING DEAL they're bad for you anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:19:58
Oh you mean like when you transfer coins... yeah not very fun and it takes a bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:01:10
Now or never my son

Oh boy, just wait until you find out what the Bose QC35 can do for you
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:35:21
Buy more now and relax. Christmas bonuses are coming for a lot of bored people over Christmas break 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:58:55
Just hold on to it motherfucker wait it out. It always comes back. It has never not come back. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:24:16
Yeah something or other. 
Look man, nobody knows what's going to happen, so I have to tell myself I won't lose my investment otherwise I won't be able to sleep. 
Hodling is hard.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:19:01
Yeah it's a pretty cool "drug" almost. When it's doing well you get a rush. When it sucks you get a different rush. Ups and downs smiles and frowns etc etc 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:28:32
Yeah the nice people on Wallstreet find a way to shit on everything nice in life 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:21:39
On gemini? The only fee I see popping up is like less than a dollar for my $500 purchases (they have been dragging their feet approving my chase account for wires for a while now..)
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:21:19
Shit I just bought $500 worth at $1700, should've waited a few hours. 
When it's red I get happy because it's time to buy. 
See you guys at 22k this weekend :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:09:08
Yep good time to buy before this weekend. And with christmas break. A lot of smart people are getting christmas bonuses n shit and you know where all that money is going over the break.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:04:14
I don't see anybody giving me bitcoin, and I don't really come across many people needy of bitcoin
I'd give away things I don't use (clothes, appliances) and things needed for survival if I see someone struggling (marshmallows, water, food). But my bitcoin? I need my bitcoin!
Yes I've given gifts.
You wouldn't give away your car would you? You need it! Well same here.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:47:45
It's this sort of behavior that's splitting up America in half. 
Enough of this shit, we are here for Bitcoin. You're not better than anyone, we are all good. 
Fuck off with that shit please. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:34:04
Gemini has like a $1 fee for a $500 purchase, that's a lot to you???
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:34:39
I can't figure out how to get my chase account approved for wiring... it's been pending for a while
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:07:15
Gemini.com is the easiest
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:26:33
They're just trying to stay positive man. 
If you get people to believe in something they'll buy into it. 
Otherwise they won't. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:44:42
Good guy google
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:05:19
But I thought we were supposed to buy when there's bloodo n the skreets
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:38:38
