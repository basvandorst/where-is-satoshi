Shapeshift your bitcoin into monero. Then send your monero back through shapeshift to bitcoin again. Make sure you send your bitcoins to a new address.

Everyone was trying to do fancy stuff with bitcoin and ethereum but Monero was focused on being a true currency.

I was using electrum but I was always worried that my computer was going to be compromised and someone would get into my electrum wallet. I bought a Trezor and it works great. From what I understand is you can use Trezor while running electrum but I just use the Trezor.

Your boss will be more accepting if break down the numbers. 
For example, if the business brings in $100,000 of revenue and spends $80,000 you are left with a profit of $20,000O. Of that $100,000 a minimum of 3% or $3,000 goes to Visa to process transactions (there are more in international transaction fees). 
Just by accepting Bitcoin the business could increase profits by 15%.

It would be interesting to see if Bitcoin has yet to put a noticeable dent in Visa's EPS.

I saw a video on a guy who used to be involved in high frequency bot trading. He said that the high frequency trading did not give the market any additional liquidity.

Bitcoin is like an abacus. It keeps track of how much you own or how much someone else owns. It is stored electronically and has a timestamp that can be verified by other nodes (someone else has the exact same abacus as you.)

Good ol' Krugman. He has to be the world's worst economist.

It is Dave Lauer. This is the video I was referring to.

I am an accountant and people often ask me how much money I  make. My response is... I don't know, I have to ask my accountant.

They will probably pay a capital gain tax of 20% + 3.8% Obamacare tax. So, they will pay 23.8% of their gains to government and the rest of it is theirs.

I am not sure about the 6 transfers a year but it is against federal law to make more than 3 transfers in a month.

BOA sucks. When I was 18 or19 they told me they converted my savings into my checking. They did this because I was transferring money from my savings to checking more than 3 times a month and it was some how against federal law. So I thought I had a few thousand dollars on my debit card. Well, I didn't. They created a second checking account without telling me. Before I know it I have $140 in overdraft fees. They tell me its my fault and they would only wave half the fees. I closed the account right then and there and the staff couldn't understand why I was closing the account.

This will be a success as long as Don King has nothing to do with it.

I doubt it. That requires a lot of questioning the status quo and government policies for the average person. They rather watch Kim Kardashian do nothing on  TV show. If something big happens to the banks I'm sure it will be blamed on capialism and greed. The majority of people will be saying, "capitalism has failed, the only option now is for the government to run the banks."

I met a woman that told me anyone who watches Fox News is a racist and the best thing for the country is if they would die. This woman was also a lawyer. If people that educated have that narrow of a view for society I doubt your average person will really do anything to find out the truth.

I was in the same boat as you in 2013 and 2014. If you play your cards right and buy in the downturn it will all work out for you in the long run.

Same here. I sold all of mine about a month ago expecting the price to drop because of the scaling issue. Today I am perplex that it has nearly doubled. Oh well, one day I'll get a laugh out of it.

Very nice, I see what you did there.

Don't you know that Ethereum will be used for everything? From rollercoasters to migrating birds, one day they will be running on Ethereum's blockchain.
