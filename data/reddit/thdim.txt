The point that the author does is so freaking obvious as the only way to move forward. It's so obvious that it makes you wonder what kind of motivation (except the sheep that just hate) haves anybody that cannot see that.

Based on historical trends doesn't mean anything. In all history you will find people claiming that an event is not gonna happen because it never happened before, the most recent example is the tanking of the house prices in 2008 economic crisis.

I register to check it out, I would take a look an the usability of the registration form (e.g. the form text disappears when onclick even without write your first letter, optimal would be to change color to light grey when selected and disappear the text only when a letter is inserted) and also maybe play a little bit with the coloring of the form fields over the rest of the box, but overall is a clean and tidy site, I like the horizontal menu, good job! nice to see european startups on the field. A referral bonus to invite your friends is a standard best practice also, you should think about it.

any phrase which contains the word EU followed by any kind of action (e.g. clamps down) is just laughable.
