The smartest thing would be to legitimately do some research yourself. Everyone hyped and trashes different coins here.. 
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:23:55

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:54

Hold on I just asked a buddy what his transfer fees have been like 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:15:57
bye bud.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:46:05
They’re gonna think that their is some bubble, but if companies like them adopt the technology and are still rather young at the buy in stage it’s a win win. Crypto is here to stay, what coin will go to what price? No body knows. We’re going to the moon and we don’t know whose gonna get there first. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:52:57
I just googled it last night when I heard about it. It’s not that complicated.

Harder for miners to solve. Takes more time - I think lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:00:38
It’s basically to lower the fees and transaction times 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:09
I saw someone explain this once but now that I have a Coinbase account I’m a little more interested.. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:41
Has GDAX halted bitcoin trading like coin base has?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:04:28
30 percent of your entire holdings?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:07:07
What a FUCKING JOKE
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:57:48
People that have tons of Bitcoin will be for it. Others against.

Except the fact that Buffets a billionaire in a tech market world. I’m sure he knows much more than you about business investments in the tech field. To think otherwise would be foolish. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:28:25
