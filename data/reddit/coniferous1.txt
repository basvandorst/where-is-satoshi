It's not difficult, but if you really want to help, use p2pool instead. 
Because all the client's run a full copy of the blockchain, even if it passes the 51% threshhold it won't be an issue.

It's not the storage, its the transmission time.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:13:02
because mt.gox still has their bitcoin.
Or, more accurately, they SHOULD have their bitcoin.

He [the creator] used their logo, he practically copy and pasted their ad.
I know it's not a popular opnion in this thread, and even though I agree with the message of the ad - it's not fair use.

After all the refunds and drama associated with BFL... Well... Paypal is still evil, but I can see why bitcoin miners might be considered a problem.
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:09:56
a great deal of blocks are mined by an unknown miner, assumed to be one pool / organization / person / virus.
it's effecting the network because they aren't confirming transactions like they are supposed to when you mine. 
EDIT: My ELI5 version sucks. Make sure to look at the corrections below.

was considering switching over... Not going to while they have certificate problems going on though.

This guy needs to sue her for libel. 
There are a LOT of negative connotations associated with being the "creator of bitcoin". 
What a cunt. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 13:08:05


This is actually good news for miners, it's much easier for pools to make more frequent smaller payouts. Good stuff.
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:11:09
You aren't wrong, but people generally choose the path of least resistance. They want to make money, not spend 4 hours downloading then make money.

Why am I reminded of Ann Coulter?

I agree with you %100, however [stuff like this still exists]( Yes, people should not of bought products without doing their research - But there is an argument to be made that paypal does provide you with a layer of security that bitcoin does not. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:45:33
Oh man, this is precious. 
"Oh, well, we aren't awful compared to bitcoin for the following reasons... please don't leave us."
Western union has all the same pitfalls of paypal. high fees, annoying processes and ridiculous wait times. 
things are only going to get worse. Even if bitcoin fails, another crypto currency will fill it's place. prepare to deal with this Mr Hikmet
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:27:42
agreed. It's more likely incompetence then actively discouraging bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:13:02
Because you need an entire copy of the blockchain. It can be rather big.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:26:43
Worked for a website that wouldn't allow people to sign up with yahoo e-mail addresses. They started blocking our (legitimate) e-mails and there is absolutely no way to talk to them. there was no other option. 
They basically link you to a help web page that says "do something different and see what happens". 
Fuck Yahoo. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:30:39


you... you can pay for that...?
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:34:07
The blockchain download is the main problem.

Probably not true, but shit, would that ever make an awesome documentary. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:59:52
it just started working again. it was saying the the certificate was registered to a different domain. 
weird. oh well. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 22:08:37
that is like, the leakiest subreddit ever. 
there are references to that show everywhere.

It'll be fruitless. I'd rather post a link with the advantages of bitcoin as a currency. 
that being said, I've learned that the wikipedia talk pages are to be avoided... If you don't like drama, that is. 
@_date: 2012-11-09 12:26:32
Kinda reminds you of the "PROVE GOD DOES NOT EXSIST" fundies.

This sudoghost guy is a dick and exactly the type of person wikipedia does not need.

No actual statistics? Check. 
Generic statements like "You will get caught!" Check.
No acknowledgement of the fact that the recipient of the drug may actually be the victim? Check Check. 
Note to self: To get back at people, just send them drugs from the silk road.

Whats stopping me from posting a dead link that refutes what he claims anyways? 
@_date: 2012-11-09 13:29:22
Honestly, considering the circumstances I'm surprised he isn't at least saying something along the lines of "there has been debate over whether bitcoin is a ponzi scheme or not" 
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:11:13
Why would they? A couple anonymous kills for lorfs, after you buy into the market and get a good reputation and a source and a product and a buyer or, just go out and kill someone on the street?
Oh wait, they are both equally stupid ideas, just one requires way more effort then the other.

Wow, that's really generous of you. Even if I am late to the party.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:55:54
That's still a long time to get a return on your investment. Kinda fun though. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:30:15
I also have my 7gh miner from them... with a 10% hw error rate. 
I still love mining, and I'm still going to save up for a (few) block eruptors... But it's too bad that I just can't sink any more money into this hobby. 
Back to coin (oldschool) coin collecting.... *le sigh*

They probably told him on the way out: "you could probably take this to court. and you will probably win. But we will drag this out as long as we possibly can. Our lawyers will drag your name through the mud as deeply as you can possibly imagine. You will spend YEARS trying to defend yourself and end up deeply in debt. Or you can sign this NDA and accept a small severance package. Up to you. "

Totally feasible to do, but totally unlikely to happen. 
Most of these companies for tracking expenses have close ties to banks, banks *hate* bitcoin.

Probably not the right place for this... but how does this work? does it talk to a computer and then the internet through usb or rfid?
@_date: 2013-01-08 18:49:13
Wow, Paypal is one shitty company. I really really want to see karma bite them in the ass.
