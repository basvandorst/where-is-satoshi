Love your uid.

Lol - I actually read that and now I hate you. I guess I'm bored too.

What a stupid article.
@_date: 2016-04-19 13:18:41
Classic is a banker attempt to shift development activities to themselves and thus control the Bitcoin narrative. It failed.
@_date: 2016-04-21 03:30:54

Hodling helps support the price as it reduces the supply. It is a natural and healthy attribute of a valuable asset.
@_date: 2016-04-26 16:23:33
I like how we all ignore the piece in between - when it fell like 70%
@_date: 2016-04-19 21:51:27
Maybe dumb question - but isn't LN a type of sidechain?
@_date: 2016-04-19 21:52:16
Bored are you?
@_date: 2016-04-19 14:22:21
Yeah buddy; XT failed; Hearn Hearniaed and Classic came out of nowhere. This wasn't some grassroots movement - Classic is a classic astroturf movement.
@_date: 2016-04-19 15:14:25
And the associated centralization and denial of service risks as a result of big blocks?
@_date: 2016-04-18 18:47:44
Ah consensus

BitSquare launches next week
@_date: 2016-04-19 16:12:26
Small blocks allow for better de-centralization and also mitigate DoS attacks. Big Blocks don't - you see why we think Classic is a fake movement?
@_date: 2016-04-21 19:30:03
Did you hear about BitSquare? De-centralized peer to peer exchange. Totally bypassing centralized exchanges ala coinbase/kraken. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 19:23:16
There is having good ideas and then there is attempting a coup.
@_date: 2016-04-12 15:46:15
The protocol was coded that way by Satoshi. If you want to make a change - you will need to fork.
@_date: 2016-04-16 16:15:29
Probably in order to save the lives of his kids.

Those someones (which we can't talk about) will also be in cahoots with the power structure behind existing monetary banking system. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:36:24
No - that is why they are having an auction (outside of exchanges), specifically to avoid influencing the exchange price while securing a premium in the auction.

Or it could represent any other kind of money they were planning. Why bitcoin? You are reading too much into it.
@_date: 2016-06-29 14:32:48
Only at the golf course.
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:41:57
Wonder who the Economist is owned by.
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:54:26
They should go into very deep hiding. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 05:30:51
Bitcoin is antiwar.
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:23:04
Makes total sense. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 18:00:07
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:13:38
We basically have central banks printing money out of nothing and then issuing it on interest. Which is a stupid system. Why print and issue on interest when you can just print? Right now the entire system benefits and is controlled by the bankers.
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:50:36
I mean why stop at 2MB - that is only a temporary fix. How about 2000000MB fork instead?

This is like the 3rd time the 'When is Segwit coming' question has been asked today.
@_date: 2016-05-31 03:40:48


How can this be confirmed?
@_date: 2016-05-07 16:00:40
So is the point then that since the Japanese like using tokens (issued by any website or company) - and since tokens can be quickly converted to BTC - this is a good thing? 
I'm failing to articulate what is the positive here for BTC.
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:51:16
They usually come as a combo option.
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:38:09
It has to be the latter.
@_date: 2016-05-21 03:47:41
Makes me chuckle

HoneyBadger vs. CIA/Bankers/Media (AKA the Federal Reserve).
@_date: 2016-05-22 18:45:23
SHUT UP WITH THE LOGIC!
@_date: 2016-05-05 00:28:17
If 1MB or 2MB is the same thing - why you don't you tell that to Gavin/Hearn?
@_date: 2016-05-21 00:02:59
but muh fud
@_date: 2016-05-05 11:36:12
Don't be surprised if this is used to push big blocks or some other argument to fork development away from Core. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:39:44
He is implying it took $850M to move the price up by $100. 
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:05:25
Can you define what you mean by "settle all the transactions" please? I'm failing to see how this is much different from settling in fiat.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:54:56
So far this seems to be the only thing that makes sense.
@_date: 2016-05-11 00:50:11
Imagine when they decide to spend millions.
@_date: 2016-05-17 02:16:04
Sounds pretty hostile to me.

Maybe his life is under threat and he is being forced to play along.
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:14:52
Wasn't there another guy he supposedly worked with? I think he has since passed on? Maybe he was the original Satoshi - and this guy was close enough and is now trying to take credit?
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:52:55

Found the Classic troll.
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:26:22
That is the hope, isn't it? (Rhetorical)
@_date: 2016-05-11 22:27:41
So Classic doesn't have shit then. Other than FUD.

They are the ones pushing XT/CLassic - and therefore creating a lack of compromise. In your own words - if 1MB = 2MB (and it most certainly does not) - why can't they just chill and compromise? But no - they want to hard fork and take over development. And the Bankers couldn't be anymore happier. The community sees that now - Fed Reserve has to come up with different tactics to divide us.

The correct answer is hodl.
