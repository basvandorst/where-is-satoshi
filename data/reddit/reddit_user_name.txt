I don't know how to uproot a device either.  Sorry man.  Not allowing root helps keep our tournaments fair.

I was curious of that myself, so I downloaded it. It looks like, even though they're set up for it, they've yet to starting charging entry fees for their tournaments. 
Even with that technicality, I think this is one of those "under the radar" type situations.

No sir!  Not gambling.
What we do is called skill-gaming and it's been online for about a decade.  King.com, the makers of Candy Crush, are one of the biggest sites online that have for-cash tournament game play.
The example I usually tell people is to think of a tetris tournament where every single player in the tournament is given the exact same sequence of blocks.  Because there is no element of random chance, and the outcome of gameplay is based on skill and skill alone, it's legal in 37 of the 50 states, Canada, the UK, western Europe, Australia and most of the rest of the world.
You can read more about it in [this]( blog post and on our [how it works]( page.

Believe me, we'd love to be able to distribute through Google Play.  Unfortunately Google has removed all skill gaming from their store.

Ha!  I can't believe we missed that.  Thanks man, we'll be doing an update early next week that includes paypal payments as well as a few other thing.
I'll make sure it's fixed then.

This one's easy.  If you have an Android head over to [Foosler.com](  There are three games there that let you compete for free Bitcoin.

Ace ten IS very fun!  It's my favorite actually.
We don't allow root for purely security reasons.

Skill gaming for cash (and crypto) is illegal in 13 US states and a handful of countries.  We check location to make sure you're in a place where skill gaming is legal.

Not exactly the same thing, but [these games]( pay out Bitcoin on Android.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:32:05
[Right here!](  Android games that pay out prizes in cash and Bitcoin.

You can play free mobile games and win Bitcoin right now if you're interested.  We're called [Foosler]( and we've developed a cash (and Bitcoin) based tournament platform that can be added to just about any mobile game.
We're Android only for now but as soon as our iOS version is complete later this month we'll be releasing an SDK and hopefully we'll see it in lots of games.
Originally the plan was to drop crypto from the iOS build, but if Apple is letting this game through then maybe we can do the same!

I just had a look at your blog and in 'Bitcoin and Gaming part 1' you ask why no one has built pay-per-play games that take bitcoin as payments and then pays them out as prizes.
Well, my friend, here it is.  We're called [Foosler]( and that's exactly what we do.  We have three of our own Android games that contain a snap-in cash (and Bitcoin) tournament system.  We're building for iOS right now and as soon as it's ready we'll be releasing our SDK to any game dev that wants offer a prize based tournament system to their users.
Right now we're giving all new accounts $2.50 to get started in the tournaments.  So it's free to try and anything you win, you keep.

Thank you!  We think it's the future of gaming too :)
One of my favourite things about our system is that a game developer can build their game as they envision it without having to cram in annoying ads or manipulative freemium nonsense.
All they have to do after adding our SDK is to add a main menu button that says 'tournaments' then specify some levels to be used in the tournaments in their game code and bam! a fun new revenue stream that benefits everyone.

You should give our stuff a try.  Because we're not on Google Play we can charge for entry fees which makes for much, much larger prizes. 
 We had one tournament that cost $0.50 to enter and first place was over $9!  The total prize pool was over $30.  Considering that we give you $2.50 free to get started, I'd say that's a pretty good deal!
I think our UI is nicer too, but then, I'm a little biased ;)

Just to be clear, is referring to coin crush's permissions, not ours.  We don't require any permissions related to accessing photos/media/files, frankly, as a developer, it's weird that they need that. 
Edit:  Sorry I meant to reply to the comment above yours.
