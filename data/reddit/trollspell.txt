Gone quiet now, haven't you. I'm sure plenty of people here would enjoy knowing your true motives. You're on borrowed time. Edit: bye don't come back.

This is in fact the great thing about bitcoin. Lack of regulations allow people to totally manipulate the market. It is in this way the moon is reached.

I know who you are, asshole. And I can prove it.

I'm afraid there's a about a 10% chance you'll get them back. On the plus side I did just make that statistic up.

Try to understand that when you put 'Bitcoin' into Google, this subreddit is one of the top results. TulipCoins and his gang of idiots are destroying it. They are turning potential Bitcoin users away. This is real.

It's not that at all. These people are paid. Truly, the trolls we face and their level of intelligence and organization. Is not normal.

I'm glad you're focusing on the real issues! 
@_date: 2014-10-29 23:28:25
You're going to remove it? Unbelievable...

Not feeding them anymore. I'm slaying them.

Bitcoin remains an excellent investment. Now more so than ever. We've had a strong rally to above $1000. Yes, there was a correction but Bitcoin is stronger now than it was at $1000. There's more merchants involved, more ways to get involved and it's really the last chance people have to buy in at these prices.
