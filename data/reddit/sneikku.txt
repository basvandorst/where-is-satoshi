Only USA and Australia I think

Many subreddits do it. Its nothing unusual

According to coinmarketcap it hit 32.14%

Use what? GDAX down, Bitfinex down, gemini down.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:50:03
GDAX is up but Coinbase in down? At least for me
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:43:54
Nobody knows for sure. Sometimes they go up but most of the time they go down as well
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:35
Bitfinex is also down :/
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:45
Price "crashed" from 19,6K to 18,3K (that was the last number I saw) and then GDAX went down
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:11:12
Worked fine for 5min for me but now its frozen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:40
But price crashed before GDAX went down. Sure, after it came back up it crashed more but you could say that it also stopped initial crash.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:15:28
Clearly not bitfinex as its also down. Maybe binance?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:37:44
So if I send $200 worth of BTC from GDAX to another exchange its still $200?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:52
How can he know its ddos attack and not just too many people trying to use it. Like GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:49:28
So its their fault that you bought BCH at $7500? Really?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:12:40
You must have not heard of Ethereum. Much more transactions than bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:00
Market had just open. Dont place market orders when there are no enough people selling. Did you see how few people were selling? Even one guy doing somewhat big buy would drive the price really up. 
I did that same mistake in once in Binance and never again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:46:20
Wow, so they lose like $30 per transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:20:06
Their servers are working perfectly?...
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:07:25
Network fee
"They" = Coinbase/GDAX
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:26:05
 
Much better looking

In **any** case they were not going to make money anytime soon. Difficulty is too high. They basically ran a charity.

[Its going to be 3100-3300](

"Bitcoin market cap"
No, that is cryptocurrency market cap

You dont need to log in to twitter. On android when using firefox browser it usually says, *you do not have permission to view this tweet* or something. Then I just reload and it works fine. 
Thats just a problem with mobile.twitter.com Desktop works fine

RIP 300k in ETH :(
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:55:43
Thats right. They are broker.
