At very least increasing the block size was a band-aid solution. LN and other improvement coming down the road are properly engineered solutions to the issue of block size, transaction backlog and scalability. You can't fix major issues like these by simply tweaking numbers higher in the source code... it's pure insanity to think otherwise. This is why IMHO it's not crazy to think maybe the people behind Bcash had ulterior motives.

Bitcoin Cash is a pipe dream for the "I *can still maybe become a crypto-millionaire" crowd. These are the people who come in here and down vote seemingly reasonable comments hoping it'll somehow translate into their altcoin gaining value. It's as simple as that. BCH has little to no actual innovation behind it. The crypto brain trust is committed to developing properly engineered long term solutions for BTC. This is something BCH will never have.

"Ln requires 133 mb blocks to function" &lt;-- This. Is. Fud.

As far as scaling is concerned (which is the big topic at the moment) nothing that I’m aware of. It’s other features will eventually be things Bitcoin will do. The biggest feature is “smart contracts”. Which Bitcoin does already and will eventually improve on with MAST. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:19:34
Thankfully that won't be an issue here soon. It's already starting to become less of a problem even without LN (with LN it's just not an issue at all). Now that some of the bad actors on the network are cleaning up their acts the fee are going back to normal levels.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:47:34
Bitcoin Core has the best developers bar-none. They're interested in engineering actual solutions instead of applying band-aide fixes. The community understands that real solutions take time and we'll not be bullied by crybabies and their threats of forks.

@_date: 2018-01-23 13:24:07
First off... I love the phrase, "Bitcoin is overvalued." How do you actually determine Bitcoin's value to start with? If you're going to say it's overvalued then you must have some idea what it **should** be worth instead. The value of Bitcoin is literally whatever the market says it is at any given time. The only way you can ever have any idea what something is worth is by letting free and open markets with fare competition judge it's value. Can markets be wrong? Sure.. it happens. But, generally speaking it doesn't last that long. Crypto-trading markets are diverse and competitive enough being wrong about Bitcoin's value isn't in their best interest (in the long term). So.. instead of constantly second guessing the market. I'm going to trust it for the time being. Until either I have some solid evidence it's making a grave error or mistake... or I somehow undercover the secret Bitcoin price discovery and get a leg up on the market.
As for my opinion of future value? It's pretty simple. Less and less Bitcoin will be entering the market as more and more people want it. This causes prices to go up. I don't see the Bitcoin network going away anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:37:41
You can't undo a hard fork... from an engineering standpoint it's the wrong choice. The current pressures on the mempool are not the creation of the block size.

We'll also be getting MAST as well (or should be). Ethereum is neat.. but, to me altcoins are development environments for Bitcoin to learn from. Seems like it's a "get rich quick scheme" or "my second chance to become a crypto millionaire" to lots of people in this sub.

Given enough time and participation there will be no single or handful of nodes that will have that level of importance that it being shutdown would cause the kind of havoc shutting down a hub airport like ATL.

It's fine if a node can decline to route a transaction... so long as there are other nodes who will. Bitcoin miners don't have to put your transaction into a block. The point of all this technology is to use game theory and fair competition to make healthy markets.

I think Bitcoin is just the same as any market. The less liquidity there is the easier it is to manipulate. The fix to the problem is more markets with more money in them. Don't forget manipulators also compete with each other. More access, more money, more eyes on Bitcoin markets is the only fix.

You should do some basic research before you make comments like this.
1. The Bitcoin network with a hash rate of 50mil TH/s processes the same number of transactions per-second as 5mil TH/s.
2. The power usage to secure the Bitcoin network is completely and totally unrelated to it's future role as an anchor of trust for secondary layers of transaction which will make Bitcoin scale to levels that will make any amount of energy it uses a drop in the bucket compared to what it can potentially provide as useful services.

Things are a lot different now. It's hard to make a profit now once you factor in electric prices. Some areas of the county power costs make independent mining insane to even consider. You could just use the equipment and power costs towards buying coins outright and come out better.
The only wild card here is the price of Bitcoin. If it was to say jump again and hit $1200 in the next 3-4 months the picture changes dramatically.  Then you might have a point. But if prices remain flat people will stop mining when the rewards drop.

As for should this stuff make you worry about Bitcoin in general?  Well, maybe I guess.. I mean everything in life is a risk.  But, Bitcoin is 5 years old, has managed to survive this long being constantly attacked.  If it has major systemic flaw(s) no one has managed to discover it.
If you're interested in getting into Bitcoin as a payment system there are plenty of players who have their shit together and can help you be more comfortable with it (bitpay being one good example).

You don't have to give a fuck.  But, lots of us do and will continue to see how Bitcoin is directly useful in promoting Liberty and democracy over central planning and unnatural political manipulation of national currencies.  There are plenty of those who aren't interested in the politic stuff.. but most of us I think are in this for more then just a quick buck.

Dogebags.. rofl.  Love it.  But, the issue with Bitcoin evangelism vs Dogecoin is all about pretense.
Bitcoin evangelism just as strong is not stronger than Dogecoin.  But Dogecoin evangelism is built on a mountain of pretense.  Dogecoin is silly and not serious.  Dogecoin value isn't important (e.g. 1 Doge = 1 Doge meme).  I can go on and on.
Most of this is total bullshit.  The community does take themselves very seriously dog meme or not.  They do care very much about the value of their coin. Sadly enough when their latest charity fundraiser didn't immediately get media coverage they attempted to brigade CNN.  Once this failed they then tried to glom some silly biggest twitter tip in history nonsense.  It's fun to watch really.
Bitcoin evangelism I like and always have.  There is no pretense.  We are the face of an amazing technology. Bitcoin has been feeding homeless people for 4-5x longer than Dogecoin has even been around.  I don't see people on getting upset that it doesn't get enough media coverage and organize stupid twitter campaigns to force the issue.  Nothing is more pretentious and annoying then people who do something nice under the cover of altruism then turn around and yell, "Look at me world! I'm so generous!".
Bitcoin evangelism has been annoying at times yes.. but at least it's not pretentious and inherently dishonest with it's true intentions.

Overall QR codes are not that useful.. only because they're used for stupid reasons.  My favorite is QR codes with zero or almost zero context as to why you should scan it.  QR codes have been a terribly misused technology.  But, Bitcoin is a shining example of a proper use of QR codes.

1.  Lots of time what they think is a "whale" is just multiple orders at the same price.  For all they know it might be 200 orders from 200 different people at X price.
2.  If it is just a single person trying to spur action it generally doesn't work.. big players just aren't that stupid.  And the few little guys who fall for it generally don't have enough liquidity to move the order book enough to spur bigger players into action.

This is what confounds bankers the most about Bitcoin.  They can't wrap their heads around the simple concept of a single Satoshi.  That one Bitcoin can be subdivided 1 million times.  That because of the easy subdivision of Bitcoin we can give value to things that would have been impossible to give value.  Such as a Dogecoin...
Then to make it even more confusing for them we can add more zeros to the protocol anytime we all decide it's needed.  Fiat doesn't work like this.. so it's very confusing for anybody who's used to having a fixed and limited amount of division of the base unit of currency.  Then tell them you can easily send these dust like units across the world for free.  It's a recipe for misunderstanding, confusion, and possibly fear.

In the US, while the Federal Reserve derives its authority from the state, it is an independent entity and decides fiscal policy without direction from the state (directly at least).  Not all central banks actually work like this in practice.  It's also possible the Federal Reserve itself don't work like this in practice.  I think overall since there even can be a question this is a reason why the concept of cryptocurrency is important.

Bitcoin also is as a technology still a baby.  Even that said it's only been 4 years and it's come a long way.  So, just think about the next 4-8 years.  The rate of innovation will increase and it will increase in spite of the day-to-day ups and downs of the market. This technology has a bright future ahead of it.  If you want to be part of it by investing in it and holding, so be it, there is a place for that.  I think most of us are doing all of the above.

If they can't get away with a outward attack (e.g. Laws that specifically outlaw cryptocurrencies) they'll take the fight underground.  Just think about the combined power of the global intelligence apparatus attacking our community on various fronts.  It's not a pretty thought.

Of course there are buyers.  But, that doesn't mean anything.  The question of if price goes down or up is supply and demand.  Are there more buyers than sellers?  Right now BitPay/Coinbase sell more Bitcoin than the market is interested in buying... so the price in an average day goes down.

Let's not be naive. Bitcoin is technologies version of "medical marijuana".  The medical marijuana movement is all about greasing the skids for full legalization. Despite what some of those in that movement might say (need to keep up appearances ya know).
Bitcoin from the very start was a political statement.  Check the genesis block.  Research it's roots and the systems that it evolved from and cypherpunk culture.
Bitcoin is just a trojan horse for a more important cultural shift (that'll likely take many decades to fully play out).   It has no regard for "being mainstream" as words really have no meaning to a protocol.

Not everybody... but lots of really smart people don't understand (or don't take the time to understand) the implications of how easily sub-dividable cryptocurrency is and how it differs in that way from fiat.
The base unit of a fiat currency is only dividable down to the smallest physical unit.  So even in digital form this is a constraint that eventually catches up with us dealing in fiat (gas prices are an excellent example).
Bitcoin and the like have no such limitation.  This is kind of novel and interesting.  Since for must of our lives the base unit of your currency was only functionally dividable to a very limited extent.
No, I'm not saying they smart people don't understand basic math.  I'm saying some of these people who poo poo on Bitcoin and how "deflationary" it is generally don't consider this point.

They will try to get a judge to hand them over the hotel because of a history of drug busts on the property. Even if the owner has taken every possible step to avoid people dealing drugs on their property.  Normally it take's a really good lawyer to keep these vultures at bay. Most people just give up under the financial pressure.  Then the DEA and local police sell the place and split the proceeds (buy more guns, mraps, and whatnot... bad guys out there ya know).

I think we can all agree if ASIC manufactures are doing this we're all getting screwed.  They're using their position in the supply chain to gain an unfair advantage.  If they where in the business of building ASIC's to use themselves it would be a different story.  In the end if they're using this unfair advantage to make more money it'll eventually catch up with them; I think.  Which is likely what we're witnessing with the constantly fucked up state of ASIC pre-orders.
Per-order now so you can get an ASIC that will cost more to run then it can produce in 6-8 months.  Ya, that sure sounds good to me.

Exactly why I started to think about it. I likely should have been more specific. Since there are a lot of different kinds of bonds. I'm more speaking about US Treasury Bonds (T-Bond). It's the kind of place you park sums of cash so large you can't trust it all in a single bank (billions of dollars). So you take out short term T-Bonds just to know that it'll be safe. The only reason they're used is because they're very safe. You know nothing short of the US Government collapsing would endanger your money.
I have to wonder if there will ever be a time when the security and transparency of the blockchain will be a more attractive store of value for this kind of thing. It's possible though by that time fiat currencies might be obsolete (thinking way far ahead.. likely not while any of us are still alive).

@_date: 2017-08-15 13:52:18
It is! You just need to adjust the scale of the chart you're looking at. Pullbacks on big run-ups like this is are healthy. It's really easy to explain why it happens too. Prices go down when there are more sellers than buyers (simple supply and demands curves). The sellers in this case are doing one of two things. 1. Taking profits because they bought in at a lower level. 2. Moving into altcoins. Both things are great in the long term. Markets must be liquid to function properly and coins moving into new hands is fundamental to our success in the long term.

Tulips as a store of value lasted 6 months. Bitcoins as a store of value has lasted over 8 years. Nothing is wrong with my logic. Tulips   blulbs came into existence as part of the morphology of a plant. Bitcoin came into existence to be an completely digital currency. There is no comparison between Dutch Tulip mania and what's happening to Bitcoin now or ever.
edit: Does this mean we're not in a bubble? No. We're obviously in a **likely** unrealistic price surge. It will level out and the cycle will continue.

It's called mining whatever is making the most profit at the time. Which means literally this has nothing to do with "consensus" at all. The moment Bitcoin's difficulty drops they'll come rushing back in.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:26:49
We've already seen. They're jumping back and forth. I love the made up narrative this is miners leaving Bitcoin for good to forever mine an altcoin. Good stuff.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:51:24
Likely means that $4000 might be a run-up. It could cause people who bought in at much lower prices to flood the market with coins for sale looking for profits. Which will inevitably cause prices to come down to something more reasonable. I'd expect to see a pullback soon... and the cycle will continue. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:36:25
It can still be both I think. You'll never get Governments to give up their own fiat currencies. Given that Bitcoin is a highly secure store of value it could an alternative to government bonds. Solely if you're just looking for a safe place to park huge amounts of excess fiat money.

I wouldn't say that's inaccurate. BCH is just another altcoin... it's intentions are kinda irrelevant at this point. There are other altcoins driving more innovation without the baggage. The biggest difference is that BCH has the backing of deep pockets (massive hashing power) and a built in user base by being a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. Otherwise, BCH really isn't anything that special IMHO. I see no reason why it should be valued at even 1/2 of Litecoin TBH.

Anyone mining for less profit is doing it wrong. Coins are easily bought and sold on the open market. You mine for max profit and then go to the open market to buy what you wish to keep for the long term in exchange for something you mined for a quick short term gain.

It's more like 0.5% (of current day worldwide GDP.. btw, you should be comparing it to what you'll think worldwide GDP will be when it's got a $20 trillion dollar cap) and 5x efficiency is just a made up number. Bitcoin does more than just act as a currency or store of value. In the future it'll be the anchor of many systems that require verifiable attestation. It's not a 1:1 comparison and it's efficiency isn't as big of a problem as some people are making it sound.

Naw... not even close. The best estimate I've seen puts the current global yearly costs of mining at $3.5 billion. Even if these costs scale directly in proportion to BTC's price (which I doubt that will happen) it's not that terrible. That would make the yearly global cost about $600-700 billion. I think that's not unreasonable given the scale of Bitcoin is global.

It really depends on what you view Bitcoin as and being. I happen to believe what Bitcoin is doing is far more important in the long run than both Amazon or Apple (toss Google in there too) to society. Does that mean it automatically gets to be worth as much? No, but here's to hoping.

I don't see any compelling reason for blockchain's to ever be used as a private database. If a bank controls all the actors in the network it's kinda pointless.. it's just a really inefficient database at that point. Bitcoin is the ideal implementation of a blockchain. It's not something that can easily be adopted for private use by a company or even really make much sense TBH.

F is a failing grade. Bitcoin’s established history is short, but it’s not nonexistent. It’s also done a lot in a short period of time. More than either fiat or gold did in a similar amount of time. D, D+, or even a C could easily be argued.

That's just how it's currently happening. Nothing about the system actually dictates that has to be the case. As the reward structure of Bitcoin changes so will that dynamic. LN isn't actually being used? I beg to differ. For a project of it's age it's being adopted at a staggering rate.

I've seen more intellectual dishonesty and scare mongering over Bitcoin's energy consumption than any other topic IMHO.
Bitcoin also isn't just a way to transact money from one account to another. It'll be the anchor of many systems that require verifiable attestation in the future. It will end up replacing many different technologies that all require immense amounts of energy to run.
Bitcoin will at the end of the day will end up being vastly more efficient than current systems. The fear mongering over PoW is totally overblown when you consider Bitcoin at scale and against multiple other systems it will end up replace at similar scales.
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:56:30
Bitcoin processes the same amount of transactions regardless of the amount of energy it uses. As it becomes more utilized it becomes more efficient. Which isn't true of conventional systems. Bitcoin also is the anchor of trust that makes things like LN possible. LN will be able to process millions of transactions per second. Without Bitcoin this wouldn't be possible. Bitcoin just needs time to mature and will eventually replace a number of outdated legacy systems and in doing so be vastly more efficient than what it'll replace.
@_date: 2019-10-06 05:22:52

If I was to guess... It's a similar value proposition as gold or other physically scarce things people share a common attraction to (rare gems, collectibles, memorabilia, etc). As long as demand stays consistent or grows you can expect the value to raise in relation to debt driven instruments/currencies. However, you could argue Bitcoin has many other interesting properties that add to it's potential value as well. It seems reasonable enough to me.. intrinsically speaking Bitcoin is naturally a hedge against inflation, but also could have other things about it to increase it's value over time as well. Own Bitcoin because you think it'll be valuable in the future, and some of that value could be driven by rampant inflation.

Miners secure the network. For this they have a chance of being paid a block reward. Being a miner does not impart any special importance outside what they're already paid for and should be treated as thus. No more special than any other user of the Bitcoin network.

The only thing about Bitcoin that has changed is the price. Every other fundamental is the same or better than it was 4 months ago. I'm just not worried at all. Sorry if you're looking at a loss on paper right now and feel burnt... but don't take out your anger on people who are still happy with their investment and quite frankly a very amazing technology.

Yes, without a doubt it would (assuming people actually used these things properly). People need to get out of the mindset that the block chain was meant to be a limitless resource they can abuse as they see fit without repercussions. Engineering proper solutions to problems is about trade offs and give and take. People are under the impression Bitcoin should provide them everything they want without consequences.
I think that with sigwit adoption alone the effective blocksize is closer to 4MB (anyone feel free to correct me if im wrong). Throw in batching, LN, and other forthcoming solutions the picture is looking really good. I'm not worried at all to be honest. If the mem pool gets backed up again it's just another opportunity for us to push forward ways to scale Bitcoin more effectively.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:28:49
So, instead of just holding the investment. What are you suggesting people do instead? HODL is also what they've been telling you're average person to do with traditional investments for ages... it's called "buy and hold". It's one of the most well known and widely agreed upon tenants of personal investment.
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:58:56
It's price is justified by what it does, how it does it, and how many people are using it. Simple supply and demand... I see no reason why Bitcoin won't increase in use by orders of magnitude. Within 10 years or less I'd say it'll be exceedingly rare for a single private individual to own a whole Bitcoin and a Satashi will be the more common base unit.

Maybe I worded that badly. It didn't account for the governors of the system acting in irrational ways (it's not a self-regulating system.. unlike Bitcoin).

Let's cut to the chase. It doesn't really make a difference how much energy Bitcoin mining is using. People take issue with it because it's only serving some small number of people while using X amount of energy. Which is the crux of the Bitcoin mining is destroying the earth sky is falling non-sense.
Bitcoin TPS scales the same regardless of it's energy use. Bitcoin becomes more efficient by more people using it and 2nd layer protocols secured by it. Lightning Network for instance brings almost unlimited scaling to Bitcoin. Everyone on earth could use Bitcoin when LN is part of the equation. So the only thing that's making it's energy use seem bad is we're still very early in the adoption curve. 
For the short term Bitcoin's energy use will obviously be something you can harp on. But, it's only a short term concern since it's overall impact on society is overwhelmingly positive. In the future Bitcoin mining will likely serve multiple purposes and continue to become more efficient.

Bitcoin isn't a corporation that has to be profitable to be successful. Bitcoin merely has to do what it's already been successful doing to continue it's existence.

Not sure how this comparison even makes sense in respect to Bitcoin.

Just take a look at the balance sheets of central banks. They're levered up to the fucking gills (i.e. printing money.. i.e. QE). We're on the brink of a multiple types of debt crisis's across the world (student loan, sovereign debt, etc). There is a fundamental flaw in fiat economics is that it doesn't account for human greed.

In a round-about way that's pretty much the truth of the matter. There are so many ways a bank can keep your money from you; if they so wish.

This opinion is just as meaningless as those who think Bitcoin will be the dominant world currency in 20 years (or ever). Bitcoin is useful and interesting. It’s going to grow exponentially in adoption over time. You sound salty to be honest.... Bitcoin is literally changing how people view money all around the world. It’s likely one of the most amazing software creations of the last 20-30 years. What makes you think technology doesn’t filter down to the masses? We’re early adopters in a technology that’s literally in its infancy. Feel free to write it off as a fad that’ll just eventually go away. I’m not so sure that’s the case.

Again.. give it some time. LN will make that almost zero. The amount of "MUH BTC FEES SO HIGH" fud still going around is pretty sad. We're also seeing zero fee transactions getting into blocks BTW. $0.26 cents would just also get a $10 million transaction moved in an hour (on average).

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ��

Both batching and segwit increases are making that very unlikely. The fee issue was a combination of a consorted effort by bad actors and bad utilization of the blockchain. LN is well on it's way to being realized as well. I'm not worried at all about any of this. Bcash was a failed attempt to grab power by assholes with very large egos who managed to persuade unwitting victims into believing a huge lie.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:22:08

I'm not sure if I understand the connection between spoofing and trading on margin. You have to be a special kinda stupid to margin trade Bitcoin... order book manipulation (i.e. spoofing) happens on regulated exchanges all the time (even if it's technically illegal). It happens even more with Bitcoin, but it's no big secret. The market is unregulated and thus all the actors understand that. The effects of the manipulation are being greatly overstated (IMHO).

@_date: 2018-03-29 20:36:45
It sounds like you're having a hard time understanding the technology. I didn't say that it was. What makes a blockchain special is the amount of trust it's users have in it and it's level of security (hash rate). Anyone can start a new blockchain and call it whatever they want. But, it's totally meaningless and has basically no application outside of a very limited scope. What makes Bitcoin **the** de facto blockchain implementation is the security of the network and it's user base. I'll say it one more time. **You can't not separate Bitcoin and blockchain technology** as they are one and the same. You're simply implying that someone can make an altcoin... yes, we know that. Look how well that's working out for those who are trying.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:12:16
Just to be clear the definition they're using for commodity is "something useful or valued". They're not trying to compare Bitcoin to wheat or oil. More of a comparison to gold... which is my favorite way to think about Bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:57:47
It can be both.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:51:50
It's quite sequitur actually in this case. It's security is part of what makes it valuable... Bitcoin's value or "backing" is very much tied to the fact that "counterfeiting" (or creating new coins out of thin air) Bitcoin would be very hard.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:57:20
Which is true for any compromise of a private key. LN software just presents a new attack surface.

Why not? If you're willing to take the risk and assume whatever you put into it might be lost or stolen.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:05:33
I've said it many time here. What a lot of people call "corrections" or "dips" is mostly just profit taking. It's very healthy for the long term picture. Especially when the dips are deconsolidating balances. Meaning that larger holds are selling into the hands of multiple smaller holders. This is the key that makes dips a good thing and healthy for long term growth. It's pretty obvious that Bitcoin is still in the beginning phases of wider spread adoption. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:21:52
It's pretty safe to assume* given what you're looking at is a demo. Why risk $50 worth of BTC to demo something like this? You could have easily used less.. but on the testnet it's not a big deal.

@_date: 2018-02-20 21:22:05
Most of what you listed isn't specific to Bitcoin. What's left I already explained well enough as being very cheap (and cheaper in the future). Literally you can clear transactions onto the blockchain for less than 25 cents (now that the bad actors have given up for the moment). If you're willing to wait a bit longer than 3 blocks you can do it for pennies. If you're familiar with traditional investing the fees are much more of a problem there. Literally something like 10-20% of the value of a 401k is eaten away by fees by the time you use it.
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:24:59
Hence "presents a new attack surface"... I'm aware of all of this. I'm not saying that LN is without risks. Anyone running LN nodes should be aware they're putting any funds tied up in the network at risk. Only time will tell how serious these risk might be or if it's negligible (given LN should only be used for transferring smaller payments).
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:28:41


That's **not** fractional reserve banking.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:32:11
You're drawing a line that doesn't exist and making a pretty solid straw man argument. So what's "speculative" or not? And over what time horizon? So I can only buy and hold bonds? Or maybe just real estate? Who defines what investments are "speculative" and over what period of time?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:11:03
Saying that a bank can loan out $90 on a $100 deposit is literally the opposite of fractional reserve banking.

If formal exchanges cease to exist you can't totally stop person-to-person transactions. China is just driving the exchange of Bitcoin underground. This isn't good for anybody to be honest.

That did occur to me as a factor that would be helpful.. but, again just a question. I'm not sure either way to be honest. I suppose at the end of the day it might not change things much.

Again what you described is **not** fractional reserve banking. Maybe you should read the Wikipedia article. Fiat currency is literally the definition of currency being backed by "thin air"... which is what enables fractional reserve banking practices. Bitcoin has value because it's fungible, censorship resistant, impossible to counterfeit (so long it's cryptological underpinnings continue to be sound), and has a limited supply. You seem to be on a mission to paint all Bitcoin advocates with a single brush... good luck with that. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:04:25
More accurately: "Past performance does not guarantee future results."
As long as more people become involved in Bitcoin and no magic flaws are found it's going up over the long term. Nothing short of a full scale attack by a group of nations or the US government can stop it.

It's even more nuanced than that if you think it through. I mean when the government fails what normally happens? The answer is always you need **more** government to fix it... or it happened because there wasn't **enough** government to start with.

There are plenty of people who have their expectations set way too high for sure. It's mostly people who bought in recently and expected to become rich overnight. This shit happens all the time in markets.. it happened with tech stocks in the 90's and early 2000. Did it mean that tech stocks are a bad investment? No. Bitcoin will level out and likely continue a similar path of growth and increased value over the next 10 years. I think that 12k to 18k isn't out of the question in the next year or two. Also, people need to just accept the fact we could be sitting at 3-4k at some point as well.

I immediately jumped to the same conclusion. But, then I thought about it for a bit. There is a scenario in which Bitmain could easily prop up BCC prices (at least for some period of time). It just depends on how much BTC they're sitting on and how much of they're willing to trade for BCC to prop up their new currency. But, if Bitmain is also mining BCC and receiving 99% of the coins why wouldn't they just prop up BCC by burning through their BTC holdings? 
I'm not totally sure this scenario is realistic or not. But, it seems possible given the level of crazy we're dealing with.

That’s largely irrelevant. Bitcoin does more than payment transactions. Without Bitcoin the Lightning Network wouldn’t exist.

No one knows what the price of Bitcoin is going to do in the next 2-3 months. It's worth 2500 now. My guess is it'll be worth a bit more a year from now. In the meantime sell and buying back Bitcoin's trying to eek out marginal gains is day trading. It's a fools errand. Don't listen to this guy. Hold your coins.

Just depends on if bitcoin continues to just be a speculative playground or goes mainstream as a useful currency.
Just a bit of simple math though... if there are 21 million bitcoins in circulation at some point in the future.  For each one to be worth $5000 each that means the bitcoin economy would be worth a total of 105 billion dollars.  To reach that kind of market cap it will have to be more than just something for speculators to gamble on.

The Fed doesn't print anything.  The United States Department of the Treasury prints money.  The Fed expands the monetary base by expanding it's balance sheet.  It eventually has to deal with that one way or another.

I feel bad for anyone who thought Dogecoin was actually going to be a real thing.

There is no such thing as "confirmation that the bottom is reached" or the opposite (the top is reached). FFS, people stop this bullshit please. Claiming otherwise means you're literally a wizard with a magic crystal ball. Being able to know with any degree of certainty you can time the market means you can generate nearly endless returns. People would literally line up to with dump trucks full of money for you to invest for a small cut of guaranteed returns you could generate with it.

2Chainz is not impressed at all.
@_date: 2013-06-18 03:24:34
Actually it's even more simple than that!  You just need to have a reliable method by which to derive your private key that isn't obvious.  Could be as easy as picking a favorite picture of a family member on Facebook and using that as the basis to derive your private key.

Just the cost really. You can't artificially manufacture legitimate use of Bitcoin. There is only finite pool of transactions to draw inflated fees to profit from. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:48:59
Fuck current prices... anybody who's here for a quick buck needs to get the hell out.  We're busy trying to change how people think about money and this sub is full of cry babies lamenting unrealized gains.  The goal should be making sure that 5-10 years from now cryptocurrencies are alive and thriving.

Darknet markets put Bitcoin in the news early on. Bitcoin being a cool disruptive technology that's actually useful (for may reasons) made it popular.
@_date: 2013-07-15 16:39:33
What the article fails to mention is that level 2 account holders also get to buy up to 50 bitcoins a day **instantly**.  This is a huge deal.  So it's not like Coinbase just added more verification for shits and giggles.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:10:30
Great write up.. really well thought out, but you're vastly overstating things.
Frist, China isn't totally out of the market, nor will they be.  Just like if the US Government enacted some onerous regulatory guidelines regarding Bitcoin.  I doubt we'd all just go, "Whelp what was cool.. rm -rf Bitcoin, shred your wallets boys".
Second, to prove my first point if they have so much mining power and they're abandoning Bitcoin why isn't network hash power declining?  You'd see that by now.

There will be one. It'll be the one that has the economic majority, best development, and superior technology. It will be called Bitcoin and I'm putting my money on UASF being the winner.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:36:37
The Bitcoin who has an economic majority.

That literally means nothing. All these assists basically start out being worth almost nothing. The same could be said of almost any other pump and dump crap coin.

Your post is bad and you should feel bad.  The Winklevoss Twins are attention whores and marginally intelligent at best.  Not some fiscal oracles from a higher plane of existence.  Your neckbeard Bitcoin to the moon circle jerking is exactly what's wrong about this sub.

Leaving a paper wallet with a private key you've had access to is not tipping you fucking idiot.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:28:04
So you're confidant that future requirements and evolution of crytocurrency wont obsolete Bitcoin?  Good on ya.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:30:13
Which will be great if then can work out a couple of the hitches in the protocol.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:22:54
A majority of the Chinese exiting the market is a big deal.. but it's not systemic.  So, really why bother worrying about it?  Unless you bought at $1200 and need to show a ROI in the next few weeks...
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:40:23
I think the 43000 GH/s worth of SHA-256 network power means you're wrong.
No... average block time isn't the big selling point of LTC.  It's pretty silly to believe that the concept of cryptocurrecy belongs to the Bitcoin community.  It does sound elitist, rude, and short sighted. 
@_date: 2013-07-15 17:08:23
As long as there are mining pools, solo miners, wallet providers, and exchanges there will be plenty of full copies of the blockchain in many places.

Who uses OKpay and why?  I see no use for it anyhow.

1. The zero knowlege proofs are very computationally expensive.
2. There is some kinda weird thing about setup where the user has to be trusted to destroy setup parameters or bad things can happen.
edit: I'm no expert and  is up for debate I guess as how big of a flaw that really is. see:

Call you up in the middle of the night
like a firefly without a light
you were there like a blowtorch burning
i was a key that could use a little turning
so tired that i couldn't even sleep
so many secrets i couldn't keep
promised myself i wouldn't weep
one more promise i couldn't keep
it seems no one can help me now
i'm in too deep
there's no way out
this time i have really lead myself astray
runaway train, never goin' back
wrong way on a one-way track
seems like i should be getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither here nor there
can you help me remember how to smile?
make it somehow all seem worthwhile
how on earth did i get so jaded?
life's mysteries seem so faded
i can go where noone else can go
i know what no one else knows
here i am just drownin' in the rain
with a ticket for a runaway train
and everything seems cut and dry
day and night
earth and sky
somehow i just don't believe it
runaway train, never goin' back
wrong way on a one-way track
seems like i should be getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither here nor there
bought a ticket for a runaway train
like a madman laughing at the rain
little out of touch, little insane
it's just easier than dealing with the pain
runaway train, never goin' back
wrong way on a one-way track
seems like i should be getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither here nor there
runaway train, never comin' back
runaway train, tearin' up the track
runaway train, burnin' in my veins
i run away but it always seems the same

I just recently had my account upgraded... still need to try it.  But, it's very exciting not to have to worry about waiting a week when I want to buy.  I'm a big fan of Coinbase and how hard they're working to make things easier for it's users.

The largest ETF market cap is approx. 145 billion (SPDR S&amp;P 500).... so I guess it's possible, but I don't see a bitcoin ETF being even 2 orders of magnitude as big as something like SPDR S&amp;P 500.
edit:  I guess it's possible though that 10 years from now a BTC ETF could be worth 100 billion... if so it's very likely a single bitcoin would be worth much more than $5000 im sure.

This was going to be my biggest point.  This is why Bitcoin becoming a national currency for some nation would be an interesting thing.  But, I don't see that occurring anytime soon.

But, guys really this is good news... are we at this point in the cycle yet?
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:58:42
Assuming the community can agree on the big changes.  All it takes is something happening that splits the Bitcoin community in 1/2 and you have the a situation where the resulting fork will likely become dominant over Bitcoin.

Anybody thinking Bitcoin mining is a get rich quick scheme should look elsewhere anyhow.  That's what Dogecoin is for.

1. After watching the zerocoin talk not totally sure what you mean by this...
2. It does?  How so?
3. Zerocoin doesn't change the protocol so much as it augments it.

1.  This alone isn't a single good enough reason to rule it out.
2.  Just because some of the concepts are on the bleeding edge of crypto doesn't mean they're not valid and useful.
3.  We have many issues to deal with that will require a hardfork anyhow.. I don't see this as a reason to count it out.
