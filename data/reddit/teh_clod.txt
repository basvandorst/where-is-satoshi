"Accepted" doesn't mean the same thing in both of the places you used it.
In a PoW system, the content of a mined block has no influence whatsoever on who gets to mine ("accept") the next or any future block.  That is not true for PoS, which is exactly why stake grinding is possible.  The optimal strategy for PoS without centralized guardians is simply to mine the stake instead of mining a PoW function.

No, it assumes a PoS where the minter of a block has any degree of influence, however small, over the minter of at least one subsequent block.

Probably because you are trying to apply economics arguments to an infosec problem.
The problem is not some sort of flaw in the economics of PoS.
The problem is that any decentralized PoS system can be turned into a PoW system ("stake grinding").  The obstacle is the shared pseudorandom number generator that decides who mints the next block.
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:48:03


Of course you aren't, because you keep **deleting my account.**
As I'm sure you know, your trouble ticket system is tied to your account system, so when you delete ("deactivate") a user's account, they can't communicate with you.
Please stop this.
Instantly deleting users' accounts and cutting them off from all communication with you is not an appropriate way to request additional information from them.


Yes, I've sent numerous emails to both support and compliance  In both cases I always get the automated reply "we assigned your email trouble ticket XXX" and then never hear anything else.  I can't view the trouble ticket since, of course, I can't log in anymore.  Creating another account with the same email address doesn't affect this; apparently the old account and the new account aren't 
I mean does this make any sense?  I keep trying to begin a conversation to try to figure out what you're unhappy about, and every time the reply is "WE ARE UNHAPPY.  YOU ARE DELETED.  GO BACK TO STEP ZERO AND TRY AGAIN."  How exactly is this supposed to enable a conversation?
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I would be very happy if you would just *freeze* my account.  At least then we could communicate.

Because it doesn't "result in essentially no wasted energy".
PoS stake grinding is the optimal strategy, and it "wastes" energy just like PoW does.  But the stake-grinders don't care because they're making a profit -- or, if the transaction fees are too low, able to launch 51% attacks.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:09:47
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:58:39


No, that's not true because it would require 100% of the coinstake to participate in this process.
PoS actually can work if you require 51% of the issued coins to actively participate in staking on every single block.  If 51% of the issued coins must sign (or explicitly reject, with penalty for rejecting accepted blocks) every single block then there's need for random selection and therefore no opportunity for stake grinding.  But of course that's a totally unworkable requirement.
So "accepted by everyone else" or "XXX by everyone else" gets replaced with some probabalistic approximation, and that's where the randomness comes in.  And once randomness has been introduced, you have something to grind.
All this betting on bets about bet outcomes is just obfuscation.


How?  If there is randomness involved in the choice, then it's a target for grinding.


And this is the other huge problem, their freaking proposal changes every three days.  I guess that is a pretty good defense against criticism.  By the time any serious analysis is complete, it's based on an outdated version of their scheme...


Wow, that's trivial to grind.  If the choice is based on the XOR of four months worth of stuff, then just grind the final XOR input to be all the previous ones XOR what you want the result to be in order to elect one of your other shill-wallets.
The schemes I've heard usually involve today's blockminter being chosen based on data from blocks X months old (i.e. the most recent X months worth of blocks have no influence on the next block's minter).  That doesn't really change anything, it just means the attacker needs to have a slightly more long-term focus.

Peercoin consensus is based on signatures from a centralized group of developers who hold special block-signing keys.  PoS is just window-dressing to obfuscate the centralized authority.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:59:20


Since you're betting on the outcome of a hash function whose inputs you can influence, there is an opportunity to expend computational power in order to tip the odds in your favor.
Which is basically what PoW mining is.  Just less straightforward.
The crasper variants I've seen (it keeps changing) involve some sort of trusted guardian council mechanism to fight this.  That can probably be made to work assuming you trust the central guardians.  But then why not just use Ripple?  It's far more efficient than even PoS (if you can't tell I'm being sarcastic here...)

It's kinda sad that none of these devices take advantage of the fact that the USB-Mini-B connector is hermaphroditic.  With the right chipset (and they are cheap these days; many Atmel AVRs have it) that connector can be either a USB device or USB host.
Which means you could have a hardware wallet that allows plugging a real USB keyboard into it for authorizing high-value transactions.  Or even just a USB number pad, they're like $4 nowadays.
And before you freak out about USB-borne malware, keyboards are required to speak an ultra-super-dumb subset of USB in order to make them play nice with ancient PS/2 PCs.  Stick to that and plugging in a keyboard is far less dangerous than plugging in a host PC.
But I guess the real long-term solution is a flip-phone type case and a built in keyboard.  But stuff like that requires pretty large volumes to do at a reasonable price.

Google "stake grinding".
Every PoS scheme involves a random number input somewhere (i.e. randomly selecting a staker to generate the next block, etc).  The only publicly verifiable source of randomness is the blockchain itself -- the hash of the previous block or something similar.
So, if you get to generate a block, and have a bunch of big computers, instead of generating just one block, generate a billion (each with slightly different transactions from yourself to yourself).  Whichever of these billion blocks *also* lets you (or one of your other wallets) generate the NEXT block too, that's the block you should broadcast.
If you've got big enough computers you can scheme it so your wallets are generating most of the blocks.
All the schemes for preventing the above are just elaborately obfuscated central authorities.  Usually some "trusted set" of users with some kind of veto powers to stop shenanigans.  I hear Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen are in this set.

This is irrelevant.  The very first thing a stakegrinder will do is create thousands of wallets and enroll all of them in this procedure as soon as enrollment is opened.


Just create billions of tiny wallets and selectively reveal the preimages (sacrificing the stakes from the others whose preimages you refuse to reveal) to achieve the desired result.


... and this is the problem with so many PoS schemes.
If all of this was anything other than a hairbrained scheme there would be a coherent, self-contained whitepaper like Satoshi's, not the usual stream-of-consciousness web-babblings we get from the etherea wannabe-priesthood.
Look, at the end of the day, any PoS scheme that claims to be immune to stake-grinding without being centralized is effectively claiming to achieve secure multiparty random-number generation by communicating with only a tiny fraction of the participants (in order to avoid the everybody-signs-every-block impracticality bottleneck) where this fraction is (in order to be scalable) much much much smaller than the fraction that can safely be assumed to be colluding in an attack.
If such a scheme did actually exist, it would be a major breakthrough in secure multiparty random number generation, independent of PoS.  One has to wonder why, if such a scheme were apparent, was it not published as such?  Lots of cryptographers would love to have such a tool and have been looking for one for a long time.  It's useful far beyond PoS.
