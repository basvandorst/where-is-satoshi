No problem. But why is the article deleted?

 has a similar idea with a different approach. But as mentioned in another reply, addresses should not be reused. However, it would be possible to come up with a solution using HD keys, which will allow generating new addresses from a single known public key.

Bip32 allows for an unsecure money receiver to generate public addresses without being able to spend.

I believe it is because the parent public key is used directly to generate the child key, not passed through the one-way hash. You can see it in the 3rd bullet of the BIP32 parent public -&gt; child public explanation here:

I have a rough working implementation on OpenCart that takes an HD public key generated by a wallet and automatically generate a unique payment address for each order.

In the list above? I don't see EFF or Electronic Frontier Foundation up there. FSF is in both Online Services and Other Charities though.

I am not sure of any webserver implementations, but the general idea is that you provide a single account's HD public key (xpub) from an HD wallet, and the webserver uses that to generate receive addresses. Wallets that can export xpub are Trezor and Mycelium.
This essentially breaks the link between your wallet (the private keys) and your website, while still allowing unique payment addresses for each order.
You can see a working implementation of parent/child key generation in the bitcore playground  Any HD Public Key can be used to generate child public keys. Addresses can be generated from those keys.
Also, chapter 4 of Mastering Bitcoin has a section on Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets that does a good job of explaining.
EDIT: Added mention of xpub and Trezor after confirming it allows access to the HD public key.
EDIT 2: Added mention of Mycelium.

Cool. Can you give any details about your other hardware? Which motherboard, power consumption, etc.
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:32:35
Did you try powered risers?

I'm not sure those are individual orders. I think they are just further breakdown of the price point. For example, I have a 1 BTC bid at 29.40 which shows 50 (1), but the entire 50 BTC at that price is not all my order.

Yes, I was able to buy 30 minutes ago, and 5 minutes before that I tried and got the above message.

 let's you set certain price points to be alerted at.
