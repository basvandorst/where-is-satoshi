Yes, because without these many Government rules/regulations, they'd build roads that would sink into the swamp, because dead workers/customers are a businessperson's best friend.

You should read the basics of bitcoin before you make foolish statements.

I think he's talking about his ISP.  Some frown on bittorrent activity.
More activity coming from him may potentially get him noticed.

It looks like he bought a Best Buy.

Overstock's CEO is committed to Bitcoin.  Gabe is not.

I'm telling you it's your own fault.  Your bitcoin "bank" is not a bank, and therefore is not to be treated as such.  
You're hardly the only person to make this mistake though.  Paypal was initially treated as a bank, and had almost none of the requirements of a bank(they're treated differently now, but when they came out they pretty much had full control over your money).
TL:DR  Do your own due diligence before you put money into something.

I'm going to disagree with this statement, merely because most libertarians wouldn't say that(corporations are creations of the State for starters).
The same people who build the roads today would build them in the future(hint:  private contractors build most of the roads today).

Assuming she uses her real name.  Heck, I know a local weatherman who uses an alias.

That's a bit of a leading question.  In most libertarian societies I see discussed, public goods don't exit.  So asking who would provide a public good, for a society that has no such goods, will never provide a satisfactory answer.

So, you're saying it won't work because people are inherently selfish?

The point is they don't have to be.

In the exact same manner as we do now?  Neutral third party.
Well actually slightly different than we do now, considering in disputes involving criminal acts, the third party isn't neutral(both one side and the decider work for the same group).

Except this doesn't happen.  Not to mention if it did, that it'd be a good thing.  Germany's Goverment was the only group allowed to use violence in the late 30's.  Was that a good thing?

You don't need a law.  Think about it this way.  How many people trust Consumer Reports?  Other reviewers?  You don't need a law to regulate XYZ.  
How many people are going to buy a car that 4 different independent reviewing companies gave a 1/5 stars?  
Fuck, this type of system is how Amazon/eBay work.  They don't need to regulate much at all.  You screw your customers, the world hears about it, you no longer have customers.
Yes, some people will lose money.  You're forgetting to mention that even with laws/regulation, people will lose money.  Regulation doesn't save people as much as you think it does.

PR?  A boatload of companies today utilize charitable work as a good PR vector.  
Frankly no matter where you are, there is going to be some demand from an area people live in.

Strawman is strawman.  Where did I say that was the answer to market manipulation?  
You'll always have market manipulation.  My point is merely that you don't need Government regulation to combat it.

Shit, we can't do that these days.  Man, that cuts into American Idol time.  Best have a group that murders and steals do it for us instead.
