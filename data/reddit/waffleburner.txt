My argument is that the crash is going to be small, we're not going back to the stone age of sub-$1000 prices ever again. Coinbase would have to steal everyone's money for that to happen.

My guess is 5k will happen within weeks. But there will be a correction, but it's not going to be a big one. It can't be. To use a played out term, the normies are getting into Bitcoin and they won't leave until someone scams them and runs off with their money. That's not something you can plan for, it may never happen.

Uhh this is a bit petty so I apologize. No, journalism was never that great, it's always been biased and certainly nothing other than an investigation would be researched for weeks. Daily turnarounds were daily turnarounds even back then. But you're a bit right, journalists today are missing something from the past and that's that they're more willing to write a story based off an email and a press release rather than actually verify parts of the stories. Nobody leaves their offices anymore unless it's to get something recorded on camera. Nobody hits the streets and probes anymore. Journalists are certainly not salt of the earth, they all fancy themselves minor celebrities. That's the main reason anybody gets in the business.

They get smarter every decade, dunno. I don't have the stats but I'm sure there's less phishing going on today, for example, compared to a decade ago.

As someone who was dumb enough to listen to a friend who said, it'll dip before segwit down to 1200, here's a big ol middle finger.

You know nothing of getting old, I'm 24 and may as well prepare my funeral because I'm so old.

First Bitcoin was $200, and I did not buy in, because I was too shy
Then Bitcoin was $1000, and I did not buy in, because I was too shy
Then Bitcoin was $1800, and I did not buy in, because I was too shy
Then Bitcoin went to the moon, and there were no coins left for me

Alright, I have 1,000 bitcoin. Should we exchange for $4,000? I can do that but I'd need you to send me 100 bitcoin as a placeholder while I send them over.

I just got into (actually buying) crypto in the last few days. Been watching since about May, and before that even.
Bought a bit but waiting it out. Passing it on.
