Yes son, but only if you adopt a new name. Please generate 3 bitcoin addresses and choose which ones would be your first middle and last name. You must phonentically enunciate these names and never use nicknames.
You must bear me grandchildren and also name them similarly. 
We shall be the true bitcoin family.

OgNasty has admitted the 1000 is not loaded, see proof here:
So that means that my collection is worth **much** more, you can see it here:
Its not a fully complete set as its missing a few variants as well as a 500 bar, 1000 bar and 1000 coin, but those are very difficult to get ahold of.
If anyone has a lead, I will pay you a finders fee if you can source me any of those. For those I dont need them to be funded =) Im btc rich, but not that rich!

Some more views so that you can see all of the grading and details:
Some things you should know:
Images are blacked for privacy reasons, this is a lot of value and I dont want any purchases linked together.
This is not a complete set. I am missing the 500 and 1000 bar, and the 1000 coin as well as one or two extremely rare variants and a few versions. Some of these coins have multiple versions and I saw no need to duplicate very minor differences. If anyone has these in funded or unfunded and would be willing to sell, I would be willing to buy. Would be beyond thrilled to complete my collection.
I am a early miner/investor and decided back when the price was between 200-300 to complete a casascius collection. I wish that I had taken the same motivation towards investing and put 100%, but things were different then. Hard to put all your resources into something that looked like it was failing for over a year straight as a investment.
Probably my favorite out of the series is the 0.5 Silver Error coin, which is the highest grade I've ever seen at MS69.  Since there were only 45 made there is a good chance this is the most prestine version of that particular variant.
I am also very annoyed at the Grading Authority for putting the coins backwards as I see it. I actually like the front of the coin better than the hologram portion and think that should be the part facing forward with the token description.
: Do you know anyone willing to sell a 500 bar, 1000 bar or 1000 coin?
Really jealous of that 1000 coin!
