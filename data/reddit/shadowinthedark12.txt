I'm not sure if all of you already know and just don't have to mention it, but incase someone doesn't, Marc Andreessen is one of the founders of the adventure capitalist group that invested alot into coinbase.

Of course not everyone will get all the money they lost back, but something is better than nothing. Also I would not be surprised if we see karpeles and other gox executives leaving with their pockets full. Not letting them get away with that would be worth it in itself

Obviously bitcoin wasnt good enough to protect us from mt gox. Just as regular currency isn't good enough to protect people from organizations with your information that get hacked

A phone app that allows instant transfer of bitcoins from a person to a business so you could go the checkout counter in a store and pay for whatever you are buying instantly and easily with bitcoin. The business side app would have to communicate with a scanner to allow them to scan prices of the items and the consumer side app would communicate with the business app to receive the price and ask for confirmation of the purchase.

What's the problem with asking him to do an interview? He invented a technology that people have invested alot in. He is an expert on how bitcoin works. Of course people are going to have questions to ask him. Instead of answering them he hides like a coward. He doesn't have to become the face of bitcoin, but he could at least take some responsibility for his creation by answering questions related to it. It's not like he had a parade of paparazzi following his every move. Asking for an interview is not violating his privacy

The reason it seems like people are hoarding money is income inequality. Lower and middle class families spend over 90% of what they make. The wealthy save and Invest over 90% of what they make. When we have such extreme income inequality of course it's going to seem like people aren't spending  anymore. In reality it's not people's spending habits which changed it's who has the money

It's like he works for a bank. Why is he so interested in taking down bitcoin?

@_date: 2014-09-12 13:35:31

What about coinbase?

Failing to understand what you just said means you are a rational human being. There is no reason the rich spending money would make anyone "vastly poorer" besides for maybe the rich themselves. And anyways in not saying the rich need to spend more money, I'm saying we need to fix the trend of increasing income inequality. I can't believe people are actually buying what you are saying.

That's true. It's making this place look like a joke to others
