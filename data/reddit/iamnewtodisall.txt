That's awesome that over 92% of BITCOINERS think that bitcoin will appreciate in value.
My only problem is I wonder how we will increase the amount of bitcoiners in the network.

I would prefer the presence of lots of 0's even cooler!

I'm no expert but looking at your blockchain it appears as if you have a lot of unconfirmed transactions, you haven't lost any money. But I would contact their support about it, probably your best bet.

You could carry paper wallets, each one containing say $200, then redeem when needed from mycelium.
(Just make sure you keep the paper wallets safe.. etc etc)

Regulate bitcoin mining imo

How could I resist?

I think I'm going for paper wallets as I really have nothing to spend either fiat or crypto on (I'm just 15 atm). How do you access your funds through a private key? I promise that's my last question.
You've been a real big help, cheers Cryptoconomy

Thanks so much for this dude! Really appreciate the help. Are there any actual cons to paper wallets (despite the obvious that one may lose it). More specifically, would I be losing anything if I opted for a paper wallet over a USB-type wallet, for example Lodger.

Not OP but I'm new and have a question so I'll take you up on that (thanks btw).
People keep mentioning that having a BTC wallet with a company (eg. blockchain etc.) is risky. As a person who intends to hold not trade I'd obviously want a high security wallet (do not want a repeat of Mtgox happening to my wallet), people mention "paper" wallets and that seems quite secure. My question is, how do I acquire a secure wallet that only I will have access to.

There's always one.

"Bit" pun intentional?
just curious :&gt;
@_date: 2017-01-09 10:04:47
Did you get my message? Either way, thanks for that. My journey down the road of a bitcoin has begun.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:38:24
Hodl? I keep seeing this term, it's an anagram of "hold"...
Explain I'm confused, thanks by the way

How did he make any money? He lost the bitcoin and he would have had to pay whatever bitcoin amount to equate the price in fiat. The seller made money..
