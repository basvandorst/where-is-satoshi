That's a problem by design. A transaction is just that a transaction. It doesn't have a Timestamp. After a while a node should stopp broadcasting a unconfirmed transaction and remove it from it's mempool. After it removed the transaction and revives it again, there is no way for it to tell that this is not a completely new transaction and so it's trated a such.  
Maybe someone out there has set a probably very well connected node up to never forget transactions in order to blow up the number of unconfirmed transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:10:52
If it's never confirmed than you still have the Coins. The Network should remove unconfirmed transaction from the mempool after 14 days.  
It's just that your wallet still remembers the transaction. Google how to remove unconfirmed for the wallet you use.  
Then you can spend them again.

DevCoin existes since 2011.  
The Idea was to have it mergemined with Bitcoin (so every Miner mining BTC can mine it synchronously) and 90% goes to opensource developers (not specifically BTC though).  
  
Nice Idea, sadly it's worthless. Who would buy a coin that's basically designed to constantly loose value.

Petty much.  
Bitcoin being a topic on pretty much any news on a daily basis.  
People that never heard of it buying without doing any research and barely any concept what they are buying only because it goes up. And then brag in the office on how much money they already made. etc.   
   
Edit: Don't get me wrong. I think Bitcoin is an amazing invention. But those couple of weeks where pure insanity.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:16:12
Yes, you are right of course.  
There is only so much you can put into a short post without getting to technical and you need to explain to more than you have the desire to do right now (I'm lazy).  
Also the 14 days is not a set value as every node can basically decide that for itself or even never remove them.  
The result may not be guaranteed, but I double-spend low fee TX successful in the last ~3 month with a 100% success rate after doing a re-scan, so I'd say chances are very good for him with this method.
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:00:09
If all coins are successful, than none is successful as that would mean hyperinflation, a problem Bitcoin explicitly ties to solve.
But year, that would be possible and possibly mean an end to all current coins. It depends on how the marked decides to react.

Not true. People who bought in the 2011 bubble needed to wait almost 1 and 1/2 Years to get "up".
We are not even at half the time they needed back then.
And if up running price to get rich was the only reason you got into Bitcoin, it's only a short way to realize why it's not going "up" from there.
@_date: 2014-08-06 12:56:36
Hu, the money used to buy bitcoin is still there isn't it. It's not burned as soon as someone buys Bitcoin only someone else receives the $.
Of course there is some damage done if products and services are exchanged solely for Bitcoin, but I still would not see it as that big.
@_date: 2014-08-06 10:17:35
You have a point.
At least this would increase the costs of accepting credit cards in comparison to revenue, therefore still give an incentive to charge more for a credit card payment (or less for non credit card payments).
@_date: 2014-07-31 08:11:45
My new CreditCard already has this and I don't like it. Would prefer a Card that doesn't have it.
I only was once in a place (in Switzerland) that has implemented it. Wanted to pay with card, held my card near the machine and it already started to print my bill, I was totally shocked. Now I need to start checking my credit card bill more carefully.
Edit: Read this wrong, my cards have chips since years, I thought this was about NFC ( Near Field Communication) Chips. Seems like the US is a view years behind in card technologie.

I doubt that the majority of people knows how exactly their credit card works. There is a similar level of cryptography involved in CCs as is in Bitcoin.
The majority of people don't care how CCs work, though. All they need to know is that's it easy to use and relatively save. Same goes for new methods, like Apple Pay for example.
Bitcoin is a whole new concept, so people using it want to exactly know how it works.
It will truly enter mainstream when people use it without understand how it works and don't even want to know.

Lot's of people simply got into Bitcoin because they saw the price rising (get rich quick). Now it's not rising anymore, people get bored, it takes to long, can't afford to loose more, etc., so they sell.
It wont go "up" until all those people finally sold out and or there comes new true reasons to get/use Bitcoin.
Can take years IMO.
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:27:12
People that bought at or close to the 2011 high needed to wait 1 1/2 years to get out of a loss. Stay calm if you followed the golden rule "never invest more than you can afford to loose", that should not be a problem.
Besides, if your sole reason for having BTC is only to sell them for more $ later than it should not be a problem for you to see why that can't work out for everyone.
(Oh, and I still have some 2011 coins)

The less the fuel is worth (costs) the better it will work for people that actually want to use this system.
And that's my big problem with ether and the like, wrapping a smart contract system in a deflationary currency is IMO not a good Idea.
It's a good Idea wrapped in a get rich scheme for early adopters.
@_date: 2014-09-09 09:21:39




That's another story. Of course Bitcoin can be manipulated like any other object on a marked. But no one can just dictate these changes, like it can be done with traditional currencies, all would need enormous effort to do so with no guaranteed success.


Nothing really. Except that every Bitcoin you want to get needs to be earned and take from someone else somehow. IMO it's also no crime to get rich, the pursuit of wealth is IMO one of the driving factors of our society. Bitcoin also doesn't claim to fix the problems of inequality, that's IMO more a sociological problem on how things are valued in our society (like a nurse, who spends 14 hours a day on her feet saving lives earns just little more than minimum wage and a hedge fund manager, who provides no gain for our society at all earns millions). Bitcoin doesn't claim to fix this. The occupy movement has crated an alt in an attempt for this though, you might want to look into freicoin. I personally consider it a design to fail, though

@_date: 2014-08-06 12:00:12
Transactions are instant with bitcoin.
What you mean are obviously confirmations. And if you think they are faster with any other coin, you obviously have not understood why we wait for confirmations in the first place.
In Short:
Confirmations are a measurement of security, each confirmation means that the hashpower of 10min agrees that your transactions in legitimate.
With for example Litecoin, 1 confirmation means the hashpower of 2,5min grees that your transactions in legitimate. So if you wait for 6 confirmations with Bitcoin you should actually wait for 24 confirmations with litecoin for the same level of security.
Or so to speak everyone who claims that a different coin is faster, either is lying to you to trick you to invest in that coin, or just hasn't understood why we wait for confirmations in the first place.
@_date: 2014-07-29 10:41:50

My Proposal, make it a floating value, based on demand not some absolute value (like 1MB, 10MB, etc max).
The max blocksitze changes with the difficult adjustments, so all 2016 blocks. When the average blocksize of the last 2016 blocks was &gt;85% of the max blocksize, the max blocksize increases by enough that the average will be 85% again, if it's less it decreases so it's 85% again (numbers are just examples).
This way we would ensure:
There is enough space in blocks for transactions.  
Blockspace remains a scarce resource (if you want fast transactions you got to pay, if you have time your transaction will get confirmed eventually)  
Free space will never be enough to add much data unless you want to face very high costs  
Blocksize doesn't explode, only a max increase all few weeks is possible.  
Blocksize can''t increase faster than miners a capable (if most don't participate it wont increase), but at the same time adding pressure to increase their capability (if only some don't participate it will increase and they will get kicked out of mining business)
How to implement:
Add a marker into the blocks (block version) that shows blocks found by miners running this solution as soon as &gt;90% of all found blocks have this marker the solution activates.

The ATM is always there and it's always possible to pay with BTC. Our Bitcoin meet-up is only once a month, though.
Edit: Need to add, this is a privately owned ATM that is privately filled, so it won't be possible to exchange very huge amounts of Money this way. I don't know about the limits of other ATMs, but this one should usually have ~5 BTC available that can be purchased.
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:16:12
At some point miners will be paid (virtually) only by the block reward, I think it's better when low payment transaction take longer, as compared to not at all.
Also, transactions are always instant with bitcoin, that's confirmation time we are talking about here, so only relevant for a fraction of transactions anyway.

The point is, out of the 1000 alts there are there are like 3 that actually had some innovation, the rest is just changing arbitrary variables and call it better (I also count the mining algo as a variable).
There is practically no research and innovation done.
Many are outright scams that trick people that don't know how cryptos work yet into putting money in them with lies like faster transaction times.

Sorry very late, but IMO you still didn't get a satisfying answer.
The revolutionary point of Bitcoin is the decentralization. No single authority can dictate the rules with what Bitcoin operates. With Bitcoin, I know the rules by which the system operates, exactly how it works and how much money can be created. These rules cannot be changed without the approval of the users, every single one (and not just the miners).
With an centralized currency, a single entity sets the rules and can change them at will, can adjust inflation like it's needed and even access you money if necessary.
I don't have to trust any central point either, this of course also come with an increase of my responsibility for my own financial decisions.
What many here seem not to get, though, is that Bitcoin is an experiment. Can such a decentralized currency work? Or is a centralized authority necessary?
IMO the treatment of Bitcoin as an investment has gone just ridiculous. My tip would be, get into Bitcoin if you are interested in such an system, if you want to get rich quick, go in a casino.
@_date: 2014-09-09 07:53:21
You already made a point about the rules. With Bitcoin, I know the rules by which the system operates, exactly how it works and how much money can be created.
These rules cannot be changed without the approval of the users, every single one (and not just the miners). Every rule change would mean a hardfork and thereby a new currency that has to outcompete the old rules in the open marked by winning enough users over.
With an centralized currency, a single entity sets the rules and can change them at will, can adjust inflation like it's needed and even access you money if necessary.

I get where you are coming from.
But at leat I have always stressed to everyone, that Bitcoin is 1 thing: An experiment (and for me it has been fun participating in it since 2011). IMO it's not a get rich quick scheme, nor an investment (and I never sold it to anyone as such).
Sad to see someone who has joined Bitcoin for what where IMO the wrong reasons to begin with quit it. Even more so as I suspect you are just one of many.
I hope that when the dust is settled the people that joined it to experiment and to build stuff stay and do exactly that so that in a few years time we can see the results of it.
That was the same in 2011. Only very few people stayed, but they build the infrastructure that allowed bitcoin to succeed  (for a time) 2 years later. I hope this time it will be similar but that "bubbleheads" will have learned their lesson and Bitcoin won't blow up this heavy again (but I doubt that).
Hope at some point you can see over your losses and participate (with an reasonably amount this time) again.
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:58:06


Just take those two statements and look at other devices your friend probably uses, like credit cards, online banking, etc.
Bitcoin is more secure than any of those and hacking Bitcoin in itself is (with our current understanding) virtually impossible.
The problem with all the hacks you see are mostly due to:  
ease of (secure) use  - Bitcoin is still lacking here  
security of second party services - for example: one bitcoin related account of mine was hacked due to a security issue of a mail provider I use.

Yes. IMO that's indeed alarming.  
Bitcoin had already 3 Bubbles. I personally have no reason to believe that it is different this time.  
The initial growth that sparked the bubble is based on legitimate reasons as it was all 3 Times before.  
It took us almost 4 Years to recover from the last one and I'm scared to think how long it will take us this time.  
But there is nothing we can do, if markets go crazy they just go crazy. Just try to stay calm and not get to hyped up with the rest.

@_date: 2015-10-15 07:37:28
Buttcoin.org was created by some guys from the SomethingAwful Forums as Staire Site about Bitcoin, while it was (is) oftem IMO way to aggressive, sometimes they hit the Nail on the Head.  The drawings that Killhamster made for example are hilarious (search Buttcoin &amp; killhamster and you should find them). This guy is a mod on The SA Forums continued for a while to make "fun" of Bitcoin. If you have archive access there, there is a thread called "Bitcoin still exists, Bitcoiners still hilariously inept". This thread started 2011 after the burst shortly after SA proclaimed Bitcoin dead. It's basically some guys stalking Bitcointalk, posting anything stupid they could find and reassuring each other that Bitcoin will fail soon. But Bitcoin keeped on growing. Late 2013 some guys get desperate and start "hacking" some guys blockchain.org wallet and steal his coins. The mods close the thread for good. If you can access it, it's a good (while long) read and really interesting for the history of this as they get more and more aggressive.  
These 2 groups are basically the founders of So today we have 4 groups in there:  
1. Guys that make some actual satire and "get" Bitcoin  
2. The old SA guard that can't see a interesting Idea when it hits them in the face  
3. People that perceive Bitcoin as a scam  
4. People that think they have missed the boat on Bitcoin and rather than to admit to them self that they missed a chance and get into it now, they are hope it will fail and troll around to reassure themselves they didn't make a mistake.  
  
The last group is quite the loudest, that's why it seems so toxic on the first look.  
However, I would awaise anyone who spends a lot of time in this sub to also lurk on buttcoin, closed communities like this tend to grow into echo chambers and reading a opposing view from time to time keeps you from getting overly invested in something.

Personally I think diversifying in cryto is pointless if it's for risk aversion. I Bitcoin will crash, all will crash. Although you could have higher wins with some (Eth), but if the Bubble bursts ETH will crash too. From an investment perspective (although I don't like calling BTC an investment) I would treat ETH as a Bitcoin on Coke, more reward (currently) but also more risk as it may be in a bubble within a bubble and crash way harder at some point.

Based on what do you think that?  
There is no maximum for Bitcoin. Due to the way it's build it's deflationary.  
I don't think Bitcoin will reach this value in my lifetime, but it will either fail completely (or become a niche application for very few pople) or grow in value.  
Picking some amount and say "this is what BTC can reach and not more" is absolutely pointless.

I agree. I have more then 50% of my Networth in Bitcoin.
All I'm saying is don't put your live savings into it in one go. With something as volatile as crypto you could as well gamble with the money when you do that.

Bank transfer can still be charged back after 1 month and Cash can only be send person to person.  
But I think you get hang up at the least important part of my comment. The point was that there are no faster or slower coins (from a block speed point).

IMO 2011 to 2012 the price fell from ~$30 to &lt;$2. That's as if we now would fall back to &lt;200 again. 
In addition to that Bitcoin was really new. So nobody knew if it hat a future at all or if it would disappear completely.

 started displaying the price in mBTC in 2013 when it first reached 1000 USD.  
And Yes, I also think that's smarter.  
I also set my wallet to display in mBTC because this gives you a better overview how much that really is.  
  
But changing it to get more people to buy BTC is the wrongest reason for that.  
If Bitcoin needs to trick people into buying it it deserves to fail.

It can happen. I don't thinks it's likely, but certainly not completely out of the question.  
This is more of a Crypto than a Bitcoin Bubble, but IMO Bitcoin will go down a bit too.  
To where and how much? I don't know. Could also be that I'm completely wrong.

While I agree about the altcoin situation. Bitcoin doesn't show classic Bubble behavior.  
I was sure Bitcoin is in a bubble until the crash 2 weeks ago.   
That it recovered and even reached a new ATH after that is different. Either different coins have gone so big that they effect Bitcoin so strongly or Bitcoin is not in a bubble.  
When you look at the total market cap of different coins, though.  
Yes it still totally looks like the classic bubble.

In my opinion it would be the same if I randomly hacked in numbers at the online banking login and managed to accidentally get access to an actual bank account.  
If I transferred any money to a different account that would indeed be stealing.

I personally would advise anyone agains putting his live savings into BTC. Only invest what you are willing to loose is absolutely true for crypto. There is a real risk you'll loose that money if you buy Bitcoin with it.  
If you made up your mind then my advise would be to at least split up that money over at least a year and buy some coins each month. Let's say 1K worth of Bitcoin each month.

That's sound a lot like you are experiencing FoMO.  
Emotions are most of the time a bad adviser when it comes to money.  
If you are worried that Bitcoin will double after Segwit and you want to put in everything right now(!) because of that, I honestly would advise you to just go in a casino and bet the full 20.000 on black instead, bacause if there are any problems with Segwit we could also see an epic drop. Betting on a big sudden increase is just gambling.
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:26:23
So if someone would guess you keys and take you Coins it would not be stealing?

Transaction time is instant in all coins. What you mean is confirmation time (the time it takes until it has enough confirmations to be considered secure). Bitcoin is still very fast here  (for comparison with a credit card its about 180 Days until it can't be charged back).  
Coins with a faster confirmation time only have an advantage when it comes to the first confirmation because then there is already some security, while a slower on still has none. But after that Bitcoin is actually more secure.  
1 confirmation in Bitcoin means that the total Hashpower of the Bitcoin Network of 10 Minutes agrees that this Transaction is confirmed. 1 confirmation in Litecoin means that the whole Hashpower of 2.5 minutes of the Litecoin Network agrees that this transaction is confirmed.  
So for the same security (assuming equal Network strength) you would need 4 times the confirmations.    
That sites that wait for 6 BTC confirmations should actually wait for wait more confirmation with "faster" coins, that none does this shows me that almost nobody understand why we wait for a certain amount of confirmations.  
TL. DR.: There are no faster coins, the only advantage is in the time for the first confirmation. After that it doesn't matter.

Lol.  
  
You assume a lot based on a single comment.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:35:27
Yes, I expect that at this point there will be a lot of stop loss that's been triggered. So I recon I'll loose about 10% to 20% due to that.  
For my stop loss I calculate "My buy in price" + (("ATH" - "My buy in price") * 0.75). So I'll get 75% to 50% the profit I would have got if I sold at the top.  
So depending where the top will be selling them now may be smarter.

While I basically missed the boat about ETH, I got a few out of curiosity what all the fuzz is about.  
What I did by now is move all of my ETH to an exchange and put a stop loss order in place for when it drops sharply.  
While this way I wont get out at max. profit I can rest easy that I'll 
will get out ahead. I'll adjust this stop loss accordingly if it continuous to grow. There is no telling how long this crazy will last.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:44:17
Well, looks like selling was the smarter move.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:14:03
That's not how a Stop loss order works.  
A Stop loss order is triggered as soon as the marked prices passe a set value. As soon as it's triggered the coins are automatically sold at marked (for whatever can be got for them at that point).

The kid got incredibly rich in the matter of Weeks.  
This may sound like a dream come true, but he is the public face of something that has increased in value about 50 fold in the matter of a couple of month.  
I can only imagine the kind of stress he is under. He looks like it's a lot.  
 
I hold 0 ETH, but credit where credit is due. He is certainly very smart and I hope that all that stress and fame doesn't get to him negatively.
