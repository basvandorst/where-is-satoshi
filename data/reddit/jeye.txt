I know that but I didn't expect sites that actively display the mempool TX count to vary by ~100,000 transactions

Ineed that's a good point. Maybe Trade Block just scrub the low fee TX's out of their mempool!?
Transactions and their associated fee's are the hardest thing to understand when starting to use Bitcoin

Why do TradeBlocks and Statoshi give such a wild variation in the number of txs in the mempool? TB is saying 12k and Stat is 95k !?
This has been confusing me for weeks now

Nice one, thanks. I'll add it my bookmarks. I knew it depended on the node as to how the mempool looked but I didn't expect it to be so very wrong.

How did you pay? Did you just scan a QR code in which went straight into the bars wallet? I'm interested in the bars experience more at this point really but I'd love to find a place I can spend coins locally in person. Everything seems geared up to online payments at the minute. 
My reasoning is that we run a cafe but I can't for the life of me work out how to accept bitcoin given that the staff on the counter have no idea about crypto.
