Start using a better blockchain because bitcon apparently, by your own admission, doesn't work.  Store of value?  That's cute.  Technology is about utility.  That's where the money is.

This works.

Gold is money.  People discount the store of value dimension and inflate the liquidity dimension, which leads to the confusion.  Currency, like dollars, are very liquid.  The guy at the convenient store will trade with you for dollars, which is great!  Currency, like dollars, are very poor stores of value over time, which is why dollars are not money.  Something that is not a store of value fails to meet the criteria for money.  Trade in currency, save in money (gold).

What do you think?  I think you build value when you create utility for others.  Is bitcoin creating utility for others?  How is bitcoin building value today?

I was a gold bug before I got into bitcoin.  I remember trying to explain bitcoin to someone at work and breaking down into tears and having to stop talking about it to take time to compose myself with a Kleenex.

Thank you for your well reasoned response.  I agree with pretty much all of what you have to say.  There have been some other advances with this technology that I encourage you to familiarize yourself with @_date: 2017-03-11 16:12:35
You do make very reasonable arguments here. Thank you for taking the time to reply.
For me it boils down to increasing my wealth.  Becoming more wealthy through speculation is how I make most of my money. I regard my crypto currency positions as speculations only.  Money is made when you create utility and add value for other people.  Said another way, you become wealthy by creating wealth for others.
The points you make are actually all correct, so I won't try to counter them.  You use Bitcoin as money (really currency btw) and it works well for you, and that's great.  For me, I look at the transaction backlog and the impasse over the block size, and I realize that Bitcoin can't get much larger.  Ethereum on the other hand is constantly changing and driving forward.  The only relevant question for me, as a money hungry vulture speculator, is which project is most likely to add the most value by creating utility for others the quickest.  The valu add will be reflected in the price.
I do not care that Bitcoin is a better currency because I use dollars for that.  Limited supply is not relevant me.  Inflation rate is not relevant to me.  I don't care about the consensus mechanism, or how frequently the chain forks or why.  I don't want stability.  I want price appreciation.  Price appreciation comes from increased utility, and Bitcoin is not becoming more useful to people, where ethereum might.
Seriously ask yourself why you're in this.  Everything you say is completely correct, but none of it matters in terms of making money.  You're stuck on right fighting instead of making money.  What is your goal here?
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:35:35
Do you have any actual argument, besides name calling?
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:16:55
There are other crypto currencies that are more focused on creating utility, which increases value and price follows.
Instead of playing the greater fools game with bitcoin.
It hurts me when you say that any money you make will simply be something you took off some other guy.  How about saying  the money you make will reflect the value you delivered to some other guy?  You will end up much wealthier giving value than by taking.

Yes.  Have you ever listened to "Let's TAlk Bitcoin?" 
I actually go into bitcoin around episode 10.  I remember going back and listening to the first episodes and being so inspired.
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:02:19
It means I don't understand.  Why are you still buying/holding bitcoin. I don't get it.  What is the rationale?  
Bitcoin crashes up?  That doesn't make any sense to me.  I am looking for a well reasoned argument.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:22:19
The faster, scaling blocks and cheaper fees are advantages.  As a speculator, I am most interested in the probability of increased utility.  Once the utility has been demonstrated most of the speculative gains have already bee realized.  This means the idebtifying the best people, and projects  that are most likely to produce results.  That is the art of speculation.  I've watched Bitcoin stagnate since 2013 while the devs fight and produce nothing.  It's a dead horse.
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:23:19
yes.  I just don't get it.  I'm probably the most sympathetic person you will meet.  I am a gold bug.  I used to be a rabid bitcoin supporter.  I just don't get it any more.  Why?  What do you see here?
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:08:11
I had too much to drink last night and got a little more aggressive than usual.  Sorry if I upset you.  Good luck with your investment decisions as well.  Cheers.
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:41:57
This is a good point.  Fiat only trends down.

Gold is money.  Gold may go up in price (dollars), but tends to stay stable in value.
Normal jobs deliver value to others and make you some money.  If you want to get very wealthy, which is what I would like to do, you need to provide a lot of utility to others.  A lot of utility means a lot of money.
If I am in the business of cleaning drives out of snow, the more drives I can clear, the more money I make.   I can only clear so many drives.  My income is limited to the number of drives I can clear. 
The trick is to deliver an excess of value, like Satoshi did when he created bitcoin.  The down side is this is very difficult.  The plus side is you only have to do it once.  Good Luck.

Do you really believe this?
