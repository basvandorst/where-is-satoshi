I'm rolling my eyes.       
You are a liar, and it's obvious. You have done no such thing, and you are dull not brilliant (or you are stupid)
@_date: 2014-04-23 20:10:41
have you thought about this problem at all??    
In order to prove sentience, you need a human proof of work problem. Something that takes the average person a certain amount of time.     
You present the problem at the time of voting, and voting ends after the set period of time. This is also good because stupid people won't be able to vote in time.    
@_date: 2014-04-23 21:56:02
I appreciate your point. Running code is like agreeing to terms-of-service - nobody reads the details.    
What to do? I try to challenge myself and be more paranoid than I am. I'm at the point where I have chained vpns on virtual machines, on dedicated cryptocurrency hardware, connecting via public wifi, in a different location every time, and I still almost lost a shit-ton when I carelessly forgot about change addresses.    
Being an informed bitcoiner is a full time job. I cant wait until someone offers to care for my money /s but really

ok, so what?    
Dye or not dye, or "ticking names off a list"....these are both thing that I think are stupid.    
We can transfer 'trust in dye' and 'trust in lists' into **'trust in the blockchain'**.    
Once you and I figure out our proof-of-humanity test....
@_date: 2014-04-24 03:16:52
just stop it. stop your train of thought for an instant.    
You are stuck in a rut, and you aren't innovating at all.     
Decentralized voting requires a proof-of-humanity. Proof-of-humanity is an integral part of decentralised voting.     
That's it. It's simple. Like the byzantine generals, it's just one problem. PROOF-OF-HUMANITY, and then decentralized voting is easy.

branding is important. nobody likes having a fraction of a thing, we want a whole! Bitcoins are too scarce. So, we need to divide them, and we can, and that's part of the beauty of the system.    
you object to the word "bit". Do you have a better alternative?
@_date: 2014-04-23 20:07:45
what I mean to say is: wtf are you doing executing closed source browser "extensions" on a computer with a hotwallet? It's moronic.    
One day, in the future, we won't have to be so careful (multisig etc), but not being careful now is moronic, sorry.

It doesn't matter if your legacy company embraces bitcoin.    
Bitcoin is inevitable. At best you can hope to be ahead of the curve
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:57:16
we need to build a proof-of-sentience test (a turing test). That's it. Voters will have to prove that they are human, think captcha, but more involved.    
I actually have lots of ideas about this, but i don't know if you're casually interested or serious
@_date: 2014-05-02 06:00:53
or we might forget about change addresses.

you sound like a spanish pimp. You do know that bitcoin kills the pimp industry, right?
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:36:42
bitcoin is two things: the bitcoin network, and *Bitcoin*, the currency that runs on the network.    
The bitcoin network is a p2p network hosting many copies of a constantly expanding digital ledger, the *blockchain*. Transacting on the network is similar to email with attached cash, with each transaction being recorded in the blockchain.    
Transactions are confirmed by a network of specialized mining computers. They are rewarded by the network, both with newly *minted* Bitcoins, and with transaction fees.    
Bitcoins have value because they are restricted in supply, easy to spend, easy to hide, difficult to steal, increasing in value (deflationary), trustless, beneficial for the poor who rely on remittance, the list goes on.

@_date: 2014-05-04 03:29:36
have you tested it? If it's working, send it to me and I'll put it in my server room. We can mirror the blockchain until it's &gt;20GB

you need to forget the physical. We aren't going to dye hands, it's never going to happen.    
We need a p2p decentralized voting system. We can absolutely use the blockchain for this. We need a human proof-of-work, and I really do believe I could code one tomorrow, but I'm busy.    
Anyway, thanks for being decent, and sorry for insulting you. All the best.

informed bitcoiners don't need banks. period.
@_date: 2014-05-02 00:31:11
you could print a paper wallet and send the remaining 8 bitcoins to it. Then they would all be at a single address, and you wouldn't have to worry about your wallet.dat file

hmmmm, Kinda sounds like you're recommending a bank....     
And yes, there will be cryptocurrency banks. (lloyds of london is already insuring bitcoin)    
Democratization of money requires informed users. This is going to be a bumpy path, and many people are going to realize how little they know about security.... :(

ok, now I feel sorry for trolling you.   
sorry.     
I'm in my late 20s and my psychedelic experiences have had a fundamental impact on all of my thought.    
Anyway, I think decentralized voting is possible, and (as far as I can tell), it requires a proof-of-humanity test.    
Maybe you are brilliant. You can see from my u/ name that I'm a criticizing troll......
@_date: 2014-05-02 10:50:01
Hey, dogetard: what makes a cryptocurrency secure?    
Hey, dogetard, here's the answer: the security of a cryptocurrency depends on its network's underlying hashrate

@_date: 2014-04-24 00:45:41
no, you're at this all wrong. this is a technological problem.    
You need to devise a proof-of-humanity test, including time limits.    
like "if you are an average human, with average mental capacity, you can solve this in x minutes". It won't be a system that can't be cheated, but you will be able to take cheating into account when tallying
