1 coin + $20 = $20 more than you started with.
10(1 coin + $20) = $200 more than you started with.
3(10(1 coin + $20)) = 11 coins  market
**11 &gt; 10**

If you cannot understand the notion of how selling 1 coin @ 590 and rebuying 1 coin @ **lower than 590** yields a profit, then perhaps investments aren't something you should be doing on your own.

And you base the **value** of your BTC on what...?

The 2 are not interconnected because a group used market bots to drive the price for a day and a half.

If you cannot predict what the bots are doing (given how they are programmed to do a specific thing every time), then you shouldn't be in the markets because you can't follow trends very well.

Yeah, I don't think we'll be alive then...

They could not panic, buy and sell when the bots manipulate the prices and gain coins for "free".
So far, I've picked up an extra 30 coins.
Too many people just don't get that the amount you spend per movement doesn't matter if you net in the end.
On a $20 drop, even if you spent $800 per coin, sell it at $590, and rebuy at $570, then you still have that same coin **plus** $20. Do that three times with 10 coins and you have a "free" coin.
Moral is: the weak-minded, the faint of heart, and children shouldn't play with "investments"!

Welcome to the world of being an adult; more than 1/2 of what we do with our $ is a gamble. When's the last time someone paid an insurance premium and they **weren't** gambling? When is the last time someone made **any** investment that wasn't a gamble?
And is it **really** "gambling" when it's a scripted routine that you can calculate the outcome of (within 1%)?

How do you read the exact words you say and say they were never said?

Doesn't "free falling" imply that it's not being controlled?
@_date: 2016-06-23 07:22:35


I do; however, I don't think coins will go for 100,000 Mexican Pesos, much less dollars.

I wish that..
People understood that the exchanges (mostly GDAX/Coinbase) have been **massively** and manually(ish) manipulated over the last 15 days.
I, also, wish that...
People understood that the "correction" is part of that manipulation.
I, further, wish that...
People understood that API access to markets allows for all of the manipulation.
I, still further, wish that...
People would stop pretending that there's a possibility to NOT link global prices to exchange prices.

There are no market pairs in your version of "in BTCland"?

Yes, stupid me... picking up ~40 coins in 3 days without any extra investment.
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:57:26
If you buy @ 800, sell @ 590 and rebuy lower (and do that multiply), then eventually you'd have 2 coins per and 2(590) &gt; 1(800).
This is basic math, people!

Hypothetically speaking: The "halving" has nothing to do with buying or selling of bitcoin(s); nor would you **want** to try to invest "$5-10M" in networking ("Bitcoin") in the next few days.
@_date: 2016-07-07 04:17:30


You had one?


Because that system (cc) ensures that in most cases, they get paid either way. Bitcoin has no such system and you are an even bigger **moron**, at this point, for continuing your feeble attempt to compare apples and oranges as both being purple vegetables!

As I see it, there's 2 issues:
1) People mad because they have to prove who they are, and
2) People crying about $10,000 p/day limit.
Most of the 1st group can barely tie their shoes, much less operate a camera well enough to take a valid picture of a valid ID.
The vast majority of the 2nd group will never have $10,000 in 1 day and just want something to bitch about.
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:41:27
Yup, there it is; the dumbest thing I've heard all day!
@_date: 2016-07-07 04:02:55


You're right, I'm wrong! Every one that has ever had a credit card has paid their bill when it came due, no one has ever used a charge-back on a valid purchase, and there's nowhere in the entire world where people have "bad credit scores" because they couldn't afford the shit they bought.
Setting that aside, your analogy is like saying that a car with no motor runs fine because it can roll downhill. Bitcoin wasn't meant to run 0 confirmation transactions, only an idiot would accept 0 confirmation transactions, and only a bigger idiot would argue that 0 confirmation transactions were "OK", and only a total frigging **moron** would argue that Bitcoin should operate like frigging credit cards!
