"I'm prepared to accept whatever sentence you deliver" then appealing the sentence makes the statement a lie. It doesn't make everything he's ever said a lie, but in this case it does.

Even if you make the case that his actions reduced violent crime, he profited from a criminal enterprise and not a "heroic martyr".

This is an exaggerated example, however this argument couple be applied to a virus that turned every light in a city green, causing accidents, that in turn caused deaths, you'd be liable for manslaughter. 
Another example is if you deliberately start a fire it jumps from arson to murder if someone dies (even in a forest fire that was deliberately set.) 
A final example. You and I rob a bank. We run into and you hold everyone down while I grab the dough. On the way out I get in a gunfight with a guard and the guard and I both die. You're guilty of 2 counts of 1st degree murder and eligible for the death penalty, even though you did nothing but run in with a toy gun and told everyone to be calm.

I'd argue that the lives saved were small (but exist) since the amount of technical savey needed to complete a transaction on SR (learning tor, bitcoin, having a deliverable address) led to very sophisticated clients who were probably already aware of the harm reduction techniques. 
Of 1,000,000 USD's of fake ID's alone were issued. I haven't seen the number on guns yet. 
I stand by the fact that the net outcome is more people died because of SR than were saved. If it was only drugs, I wouldn't hold that position.

OK, what I'm talking about is the crimes that were facilitated. 
When you arrange for an illegal firearm transfer across state lines, it carries a 10 year federal penalty per incident. He's responsible (or at least an accomplice) in 1,000's of felonies. 
This is what I don't get. Because he made illegal actions "safer" for maybe 100,000 felonies he should be let off the hook. It's the same argument the mob would make. 
Again, I disagree with life with out parole, but he facilitated drugs, guns, possible terrorist actions (even if not against Americans) and likely ordered 3 - 6 hits on people. How is this any better than a mob kingpin?

I love the "good day sir", I use it so when someone says something I don't like, I can say "I SAID GOOD DAY... SIR". 
Your argument is invalid. Your point is *no criminals should be charged* because *all criminals aren't charged*. 
This is know as "an appeal to irrelevant authority" in logic.

I actually agree with you, on the substances part at least, but it's not legal. It's not legal and not in that "well slavery was legal kind of way" - it not. There were no controls on who bought it - do you think it's cool that children (who by far were the most sofisicated) had access to to hard drugs and guns should be legal? Do you think that convicted murders had *access* to guns is cool? Do you think providing a forum for murder-for-hire is "free trade". 
You're probably a responsible guy, so your caught up in "should I have access?" you're not thinking "should *anyone* have access". 
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:49:21
Yes, you're probably right. But, as an extreme example, what if the police kill an unarmed person then someone else kills your mom. Should the person that killed your mom go free because the police have a murderer in their ranks? 
It makes it no better that the police killed someone, but someone still killed your mom.

I'm just going to copy and paste the same thing I posted otherwise. 
I'm sorry this isn't Wikipedia and I can't cite sources. You're argument is "you can't prove it! Lalala".
Do I really need to prove that someone that facilitated in 100,000's drug sales, 100's or 1,000's of gun sales and 1,000's of fake passports and at least the 6 murder-for-hires that he set up saved lives? 
Fuck me for using a bit of logic. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:50:30
I also hope that's not the case (Although I think you're right), but I hope he's sentenced in a manner consistent with the others in this crime. 
I also hope the laws change. He doesn't deserve to spend his whole productive life away from the world. (unless he really did order that hitman - then life without parole.) 
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:09:08
It actually does. All crimes are brought X "vs the people". 
If you are shot, you can't drop the charges, because the crime is against society, not you (althought you can see in a civil court). 
If the DA fails to brings charges against a corrupt police officer, you would still want them to bring charges against someone who tried to kill you, right?
Basically, the argument that someone who isn't charged for a crime shouldn't mean no one can be charged for the same crime.

Even though it was a small part of SR, guns, fake credentials, attempted hits. That's enough. Although unprovable, there are people dead that would be if not for RU.

That's a straw-man argument. Because one similar, but unrelated, incident happened, this other incident shouldn't count. 
FWIW DPR got what he had coming. I at least think he should have the possibility of parole though. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:40:14
Agreed. It hurts - I'd feel the same way. 
But he has the ability to express himself in poignant words. How many of other 1000's of less sophisticated clients feel the same way. 
He must be sentenced in a manner consistent with the multitude who never see the light of day. 
Change the law and release the plethora who deserve it and don't spare the one who can express it.

By that logic, the former agent who appeared to be fleeing is also unproven. 
Two wrongs (Ross and FORCE 4) don't make a right. 
That said, a retrial is definitely needed. The evidence is just too corrupted at this point.
@_date: 2016-02-02 21:35:14




*Any* evidence collected from them is considered "fruit from a poisonous tree", and therefore inadmissible. This legal precedent was first decided in 1920 in *Silverthorne* *Lumber* *Co.* v. *United States*
If any of the evidence they collected was presented to the jury, the jury has become tainted (even if the evidence is 100% accurate). The state - in this case the United States, is compelled to give a retrial as this is a violation of the 6th amendment's right to a fair trial.
This isn't to say he wouldn't be convicted again, simply a retrial is well within his rights.

Here's what I've been trying to avoid because I think Ulbricht is guilty as sin and deserves his sentence. I didn't want to come off as a RU apologist.
That said, from the moment that Force took over one of the account of an Admin (I forget which one), he began setting up a criminal enterprise. He did just about anything possible to funnel money into his account. 
The important this is that he *could* have done anything to the website / logs. He effectively entrapped RU into murder for hire. He probably didn't change the logs, user ID, or any of that, but he could have. (Remember both the presumption of innocents and beyond a reasonable doubt standard for conviction.) 
So you ask me what evidence specificly is at issue? Any evidence that was collected from the SR market, forums, user logs... anything to do with the site. Anything that any further investigational body (namely the New York branch) presented to the jury came from potentially tained evidence. He (Force) fucked up so badly that he contaminated the entire digital crime scene. I don't believe that any evidence collected from SR from the moment Force touched the site is admissable. Honestly, as sickening as it, he should be exonerated, not retried. 
So let me present you with three (easy) direct questions of my own. 
1. Was any evidence gathered from SR after Force logged on?
2. If yes, was any of this evidence presented to the jury?
3. If yes, do you believe that it is legal (or ethical) to convict a man to life without parole based partially on inadmissible evidence?
@_date: 2016-02-03 12:12:58
I agree that quite a bit that evidence was gathered from other sources. He appeared to be caught red handed at a public library. 
That said, I answered your question(s) - I respectfully request you answer mine.

That was the same process I used.  I opened a ticket. 
I happened to have scans of my DL and 2 utility bills from tier-3ing Kraken, so I was able to send them what they asked for in about 5 minutes and replied to the ticket. IDK - maybe the person who had my ticket also got my reply and it went through? 
Maybe my account is empty, so low risk? Doesn't really matter - still can't get in. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:07:38
I'm in a similar boat. 
I've been trading ETH and mined altcoins back in late 13 - early 14 and used btc-e.
 Forgot all about it until a week ago, tried to log on and got the "account suspended" message. Sent off utility bills and DL and got verified again. 
By the time the "you're verified" email came, they were shut down. 
I have no idea what is in my account. Could be nothing, could be something good. What timing.

Not much activity on r/Mtgox so I needed to ask here. Left over from a few small transactions a while ago, I realized that I had like $50 in my MtGox wallet. I waited for a lull and bought the tiny amount of a BTC that I had enough for. Now it's up and I've tried to sell it. The sale won't go through. Even market sell orders hang in pending status and I should get a yes or no right away.
My authorization is pending,  but I'm not trying to deposit or withdraw. The delays shouldn't be affecting me now,  right? Anyone know why my sale would execute.
