how's that true if the top 10% of wallets have over 1 BTC?
@_date: 2019-03-16 05:06:40


Yeah their BTC price is a good $10-20 lower than other exchanges.

good morning, how are you? welcome to 4k BTC.

What's happened to the original laptop? Recovering that is your best bet. Even if you have to go dumpster-diving.

I appreciate you bitcoinfloridagator!

Actually I just made one last night:
The tx fee for $100 worth of BTC was literally 0.0003568 BTC or 1.94 USD and that was with segwit.. So yeah, I didn't just pull that number out of my ass, it was based on an actual transaction I made recently. When's the last time you made a tx and what were the fees - can you link to it on the blockchain? 


Lmao you act like you're proud of that. The boast shouldn't be "under a dollar," the boast should be "under 3 cents." If I wanted to pay this much in tx fees I'd just stick with Paypal. 
I have nothing bad to say about LTC or any alt-coin that attempts to make crypto about cheap, decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system. But the argument in this thread wasn't about LTC vs. BTC, it was about BTC vs. BCH ... you simply switched it to be about LTC vs. BCH .... because you know BTC doesn't stand a chance in this arena (scalability). 
LTC is a great competitor to BCH, but I would argue that BCH is built on great tech and has a strong network effect with the Bitcoin name attached. Just the name (having "Bitcoin" in it) makes it a potential usurper, which is why BTC maximilists are so mad about it (and not mad about LTC). 
Also, your statements about LTC: "It's faster, cheaper, more decentralized, more widely used" are patently false. LTC tx fees are historically higher than BCH, at times as much at 10x higher:
This can be proven with a simply Google search ... 
And if you think LTC is especially decentralized, man you are seriously misinformed. BCH and LTC both suffer from more centralization (compared to BTC). But decentralization isn't the goal. Consensus is the goal. Decentralization is merely a tool to that end. If we can get consensus while lowering the decentralization meter just a bit, I say it's worth it. Especially if it's the difference of 1000 tx per second vs 10 tx per second.
Also, if decentralization is so important to you, why aren't you up in arms about 80% of BTC miners being in China, a place where crypto use itself is banned by a government that is, to put it lightly, totalitarian by western standards?
BTW, I am not a BCH maximalist. I just think it's foolish to dismiss it as an illegitimate competitor.

Bitcoin Cash.

I don't think you understand the irony here. The website professes to be all about anti-censorship, yet in the very next sentence explicitly states things that it censors.
I also think you are probably the owner of the website.

Even experts are less bold in their assessments.
Seriously though, have you ever transacted in BTC vs BCH? The fee for BTC is around $2 for $100 worth now and takes 30 minutes to an hour for 3 confirmations. How can that be right? The devs have openly stated they want high fees and transaction times. 
BCH fees are next to nothing. BCH is 100x more scalable. If your goal is a digital currency for everyday use, BCH is your best bet. Don't listen to what everyone on here says. go to r/btc to hear a second opinion.
If I'm banned from this sub for suggesting that, it's only further proof of censorship.
