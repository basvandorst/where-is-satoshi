As someone who recently (5 years ago) became independently wealthy, I met with representatives of various banks to open my private banking accounts and discuss wealth management. I looked at their various strategies. I also looked at the various online wealth management platforms.
I was not impressed. I realized their incentives basically were so off from helping me, they'd pitch whatever made them the most money.
I also considered a permanent portfolio style approach: 25% Gold, 25% Bonds, 25% Stocks, 25% Cash. But again I wasn't convinced. (tho this seems a lot more reasonable than modern portfolio theory)
What I opted instead for is an approach where I try to keep most of my capital preserved as insurance, and then use small investments to make money using moonshots (e.g. investing in startups and bitcoin).
E.g. 30% Cash, 5% Gold, 20% Bitcoin, 20% Stocks, 25% Startup Investments.
In practice my portfolio has become a little more lopsided, both because my startup investments and bitcoin investment have outperformed my other investments, and because the remaining startup investment portion is allocated slowly over years (and I keep it in cash till then). Also initially I had allocated a higher portion for Gold than for Bitcoin, but when Gold started dropping, I rebalanced because I decided Bitcoin was a safer investment than gold for my purposes.
I think the other investments provide sufficient safety (e.g. preventing me from falling back to losing it all), that I'm not keen on rebalancing out of the successful pre-ipo startups and bitcoin.
In summary: The idea behind the portfolio is make money on the outliers, and use the rest of the capital as a safety. Don't try to make money on your safety capital, and accept that you can lose your risk capital (and spread it across many different investments accordingly)
