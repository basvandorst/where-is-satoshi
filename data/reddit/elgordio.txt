A block includes a coinbase transaction, which is the new coins that were generated as part of the block.
For reasons, that I don't believe anyone knows for sure, the coinbase transaction for the genesis block was not added to the transaction database by Satoshi and therefore cannot be used as inputs in a future transaction(i.e. cannot be spent).

While this is good progress I'm not sure what it really proves all that much unless an audit is also done of their fiat liabilities at the same time.
Say for example they lost 50 BTC at some point, could they not use their fiat balances to purchase BTC and make the BTC balance whole again? This audit will then have passed despite the exchange operating with a deficit.
Or am I missing something here?

Older coins have higher priority on the network and you can generally move them without transaction fees. This is because you can't spam the network with old coins as once you've moved them once they are new again. This is pretty much the only difference between old and new coins from a technical point of view.
However some people have decided to use 'days destroyed' as a metric of the velocity of the money moving around the network. The metric on it's own isn't really that interesting but combined with other analysis can be interesting. Such as in the recent case it seems to be related to MtGox activity.
Generally an increase or decrease in days destroyed isn't a good or bad thing. Its just interesting.

All I meant by /time is that it has to be measured over some interval. Ie bitcoin days destroyed is (sum BTC value transacted in  one day * sum age of coins used in one day) / 1.

Personally I think it's a pretty useless metric. Newer users will have newer coins which are under represented. However it tends to increase in bubbles (see April and Dec 2013) which people then use for justification for the bubble itself. However I think the increase caused by people taking coins out of storage to sell during the bubble.
I think this presents a more compelling argument for overall usage even it it's rather simple and could in theory be manipulated fairly easily:

No it's not double spending. When a transaction is made is is unconfirmed but the outputs can be used (by the person receiving the first transaction) in another unconfirmed transaction and so on. However the transactions must be added to the blockchain in the right order, possibly all at the same time, possibly over multiple blocks.
Double spending would be trying to make the same transaction twice. Where as spending an unconfirmed transaction is still creating a chain, it's just not yet confirmed.

If i understand you correctly. The thing is measuring bitcoins/day isn't useful because it's easy to fudge that metric as moving large volumes of BTC is almost almost free. The measurement of (BTC value * BTC age)/time is supposed to give you metric that is less susceptible to manipulation.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:02:52
I think we are talking about two different things. You're talking about the cumulative data:  and I'm talking about the per day data 
Unless I'm totally misunderstanding this!

At best I think people can hope for taking a significant hair cut. The chance of getting all their btc/fiat back seems minimal

I had been intending to switch my node to XT but didn't really prioritise it. All this censorship madness has made me get off my arse and switch it over.

I doubt the ISP in this instance. A huge increase number of panic traders trying to get in the network could look awfully like a ddos from an ISP point of view (depending on how competent they are...)

Well they've been down to $60 up to $80 and down to $60 again, just all over the place.
Fundamentally no-one knows what is going to happen... Personally I'm expecting a sharp decline, followed by a sharp spike ,followed by a gradual decline over months as everyone gets bored and moves on. Time will tell...
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:57:38
My prediction.
* Sharp fall, then
* Sharp recovery of most of that fall, then
* Gradual decline for weeks/months....

In my experience blockchain.info will accurately calculate whether a fee is required or not. If the transaction has a high enough 'priority' then it does not require a fee.
Priority is calculated by a combination of the age of the inputs and the size (in bytes) of the transaction. As the inputs get older their priority increases and thus the requirement to pay a fee decreases.

I expect you're right for at least the next cycle, I think $30 is a reasonable purchase price. After that though I expect there will be another bubble, along with the associated 'this time it's for real' claims.
However I'd look *way* beyond 2014 for any sort of price stability. Until users can easily and reliably transact in and out of their local currency then there are significant road blocks, also the volatility itself will hold people back. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:45:29
Personally I don't think so, still a way to go yet. Bottom out at maybe $20 to settle at $30, that's where my money is anyway :)

You have an interesting idea. You need some way to encode the users session identity into the URL so they can bookmark it, and then clear cookies, move to a different browser etc... Take a look at satoshicircle.com to see what I mean.
Also you need to provide the service on https to prevent sniffing of the same data.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:21:59
I think using a log scale is more informative. Here's my prediction: [
$30 before were back to the 'mean'.

Now &lt;$80 on bitstamp and btc-e
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:51:55
Ah right I see what you mean, you could well be right based on current trends.
I'm just yet to be convinced there is sufficient 'real demand' to sustain $100. I see the only real value of BTS as a pseudo anonymous transactional currency. I'm yet to understand why someone would use bitcoins at their local burger joint (or any of the many other recent examples of places taking bitcoins) when they could just pay local currency (given the prices will be indexed linked anyway).

I made a transaction out of a blockchain.info wallet last night and it didn't include a fee, it took at least 3 blocks before a miner put in on the blockchain, maybe more, I stopped watching it. I'm not sure what they've changed because it used to include a fee when that would be generally considered necessary. Maybe I should stop using 'quick send' and investigate the 'custom' option more.

The amount of coins generated per block will be halved. The rate of generation of blocks remains the same.
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:35:33
True. I'm imagining a long slow decline to that point, maybe over months, and expect a lot of the current frenzy to have died down and people to have lost interest and moved their money away. There is probably too much interest for it to get anywhere near $20 now (assuming no further panic sell off...).
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:10:11
Possibly you're right, I have had a similar experience with non-tech friends asking about BTC. However I fully expect their interest to evaporate if we hit a declining market.

I think most of the supposed 'DDOS' attacks are just people frantically hitting the network as they try to clear their positions... It can look awfully similar in the right circumstances.
When was the last time bitfloor was around when mtgox was hard down for 12 hours? Do they have any experience of this situation? (I'm going for 'no')
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:54:10
Seconded. If you're patient the gap between localbitcoin and mtgox can be near zero (or even negative). Not so much recently but things will settle down eventually. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:47:30


You know every market that is open has it priced at $60-$70 yeah?
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:24:13
Because until you actually add/withdraw bitcoins from your MtGox account the transactions take place internally within MtGox.
You could submit 10 BTC to MtGox, trade it 1000 times then withdraw it. That would only be 2 transactions on the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:22:06
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:34:48
Most of the places accepting BTC are indexed linked to MtGox (or similar) so they just trend up/down with the tradable value.
