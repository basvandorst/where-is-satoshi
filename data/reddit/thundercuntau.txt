"Excuse me sir, do you have a moment to talk about our Lord &amp; Saviour ~~Jesus Christ~~ Satoshi Nakamoto?"
This is just weird OP.

It's not about highs or lows; it's about volatility. Penny stock volatility makes Bitcoin a *bad* long term store of value.

This should be Bitcoins new slogan - “slightly
Better than the worst currencies in the world”

I think the dead give away was the teacher giving a 10 year old a zero, telling him his work is "unacceptable" and to rewrite the work in the context of a "Ponzi scheme". The comments celebrating the genius of the child and the stupidity of the teacher... Ugh. 
Want to know what ten year olds write about with the coolest technological breakthroughs? They'll waffle on about some bullshit holographic DS, the PS8, maybe Google Glass and the really inventive ones might know something about Occulus Rift (or similar). It definitely wouldn't read like cultish devotion to decentralisation, tax implications of a new currency and the pseudonum of their favourite toy. That'd just be straight up fucking *weird* anyway.
Have none of you *met* children? 
Fuck me.

That's a feature, not a bug, of being a consumer-friendly payment system.

CGT only applies to *gains*, so that doesn't really make sense -- it certainly doesn't dissuade people from investing in the ASX, property, forex...

That's why his stock price is down 70% for the year.

Unless the renewable energy source is underutilised, the fact that Bitcoin comes from renewables is irrelevant in terms of environmental impact because it is by definition pulling resources away from other activity. This is why the comparison to other - more efficient - transactional systems is relevant. 
The report that this references re: renewable resources is incredible spurious anyway. 4% of the hashing power of the total Bitcoin network exists in one building in a shitty abandoned region of China, powered entirely by a coal mine. Are we really suggesting that there is only another 11% that is powered by coal - based on "colleages in Hong Kong"? 
How do we reconcile this wild assertion with the fact that wild scale flooding in Sichuan didn't wipe out 80% of the hash rate? Sichuan is a Bitcoin good news story, but taking it and saying "this is the exact use case fo 85% of miners" is quite literally making shit up for an agenda.

I'm really not sure I follow.
Bitcoin can use a large amount of power in the desert.
We can build a large power plant in the desert. To power bitcoin. This fixes climate. Is that the gist..?
Energy is a zero sum game. By definition, unless the resource is being underutilised, the notion that we should *build something to consume more power* is just weird mental gymnastics.

Slow clap.
Fortunately there's all these brilliant keyboard economists that know better than that.

I feel like this is a really bad example.


All those "transactional benefits" like... requiring a friend to pay in real money and then giving them an IOU.
I feel like all of these evangelists just make Bitcoin sound fucking horrid.

Banks close accounts on Bitcoin businesses. This is good thing for Bitcoin^TM. 
Please, never change.

Literally have more utility in my city than Bitcoin if your intention is to make a purchase, so I suppose.


What I am describing is the Bitcoin ecosystem. You're not paid in it; you can't pay your rent in it; you can't pay your mortgage with it; you can't buy groceries with it; you can't buy everyday needs items with it. The handful of merchants that currently take bitcoin don't *hold* them as Bitcoin because its volatility makes it a liability, which means they use an intermediary to extract their money... much like the traditional banking sector. And if you want to go and purchase Bitcoin (as you are not paid in it), you need to go to an intermediary to convert your dollars to internet pesos. And if you then want to pay your mortgage with a bitcoin, you need to go to an intermediary to convert your internet pesos to dollars. Each of these steps attracts fees and takes more time than existing banking infrastructure, which makes statements like this:


Straight up silly, because btc requires the exact same intermediaries to be of any worth to anyone.

There already is money for the internet. It's called money.


And if you actually want to use Bitcoin to pay for any sort of good, guess what process you have to go through -&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

That’s another cutting insight. The point is that the notion that $3900 is “insane for any asset” is just uninformed drivel.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:13:29
My house is an asset. It is worth more than $3900 by a considerable margin.
My car is an asset. It is worth more than $3900.
My VAS shares are an asset. It is worth less than $3900.
There is no basis to what you’re saying.
