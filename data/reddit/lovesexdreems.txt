Is localbitcoin.net legitimate? My first time
@_date: 2017-04-16 19:25:20
Hi this is my first time buying - just wondering if localbitcoin is a safe and if they send directly to my wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:32:54
How is a hardware wallet safer than a software wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:04:40
There has been a 300% percent increase in btc since last April
By the way 300% percent is redundant

I have around 20$ in a wallet from almost a year ago but I lost my key words to log in my wallet or whatever. I should look into it more
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:22:11
So as long as I immediately move my btc from coinbase to my wallet I would be fine?
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:26:04
I thought about buying some btc when they were 900$ each
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:45:17
Will this fork or whatever the hell it is change anything about how I can still buy and use the original BTC in anyway?
How does this new BTC affect the 21 million limit? Is that 21 million each or total now?
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:03:20
I would personally buy it all at once now or in the next dip or during dips. That's just me though 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:36:10
Except the good market is 1000x less volatile and more stable than the btc market
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:29:55
I thought I was at 5500$
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:13:15
What is hodl? Hold?
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:12:22
I think it will stabilize the most when it hits its btc capacity in like 20 years of 20-40 million or whatever. Otherwise it might hit 10k relatively soon
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:13:53
What did coinbase do 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:07:23
I hope they do because then I'll hold onto mine and they'll be worth millions
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:17:53
Is the credit card option new? Last I checked you needed a bank account plus a photo id
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:20:29
Holy shit what do I do
How do I get replay protection 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:05:56
What is a replay attack? Sounds like some sort of escrow transaction scam where your payment gets accepted before the transaction and refused after the transaction 
Newbie here 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:16:20
Is ledger what they call a hard wallet or whatever for like 20$ and supposed to be safer? I thought bitcoin was already very safe
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:19:44
Is the credit card option new? Why are people mad at coinbase now days?
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:27:26
I think the one I used was mycelium seemed to work fine
Edit the one I used was blockchain good luck
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:28:43
I don't get it
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:32:12
I don't think it's possible for bitcoin to be a bad long term investment given the limit capacity causing a constantly rising demand 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:11:17
I think this is allowed. You can use an escrow service like localbitcoin but there privacy policy changes November 1
