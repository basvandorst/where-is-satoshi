same result
so it generates 2 private keys each time, use the 1st or 2nd?

hey! not not yet! been moving! is it worth moving it for the fee? its a very small fee, right? i kinda wish i could visit the site on a desktop, but would recommend coinomi regardless?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:58:41

@_date: 2017-11-07 22:41:24
sorry i shouldve been more specific, to claim my bcash initially, i would be moving my bitcoin into coinomi, correct? i have the accounts created in coinomi im just nervous im going to do it wrong still.

u/bitcoincitadel you are a kind soul and i greatly value the time youve spent already.

I only moved a very small amount from Block.io to Coinbase. Would the Coinomi account i am setting up BE the new address? I know that sounds basic but the smallest details concern me. 
So ive installed Coinomi, and its asking me which coins id like to use with my wallet, i have litecoins, bitcoins and etherium, so i selected those. Bitcoin cash as well as Bitcoin gold, i dont have yet, but my guess is to select those too. Sweep into coinomi means transfer?
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:44:12
I dont have a real preference, so yeah, coinomi sounds good. What is the purpose of moving them?  I have USD in an online account as well, should i buy as much BTC as i can before i transfer my BTC from my first account to my new one? or does it not matter
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:28:22
No I did not! Ha that's just sitting somewhere waiting for me to claim it? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:13:55
im close
would my output address be my like 36 character Coinomi BCH address????????
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:50:59
What may not be automatic? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:03:36
lol i really appreciate you trying to help me but i have no idea what that means.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:07:26
and the reason you say I dont have to move it, as ive continued reading is becasue the risk has dropped signifigantly since august when everyone was doing this? if i wanted to be totally safe id move my BTC to a wallet seperate from my block.io account so that coinomi couldnt.... access my BTC through the private key i gave them for my Bcash? 
am i piecing this together at all?
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:32:44
if i have a txid does that indicate that it should be going through sooner or later?
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:04:28
ahhhhh this makes much more sense i considered the move to be a crucial component
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:20:59
Each time i generate the private key its a new key?
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:14:20
got all the way to sweeping the private key, but then it says the private key does not contain any funds, which is incorrect, any idea what could cause that? 
I created the BCH wallet in my coinomi account with the M/44H/0H/0H derivation code
My BTC is still in my Block.io account, thats fine right?
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:36:21
and the bcash will populate in the coinomi account?
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:52:20
okay so if i can keep my bitcoin in my block.io account, how do i prove i have it to coinomi? or would i get the bcash from block.io?
