So then all we'd need is some entrepreneurial individual to design his own linux based bitcoin wallet devices, sell them on ebay or somewhere, and secretly install backdoor software on each one that would run on the root level account. Maybe wait a year before activating them all.
So essentially, "where there's a will there is a way". Thieves will forever circumvent any security measure in place, as long as bitcoin remains irreversible, the reward is so great.

Why do people troll scientologists or other types of religious fanatics? The unbridled optimism and faith in bitcoin, despite the evidence that interest is waning and consumers and investors are avoiding it makes for an easy target.

I'm sure all the people who had their funds stolen from their PCs or online exchanges, or the people who lost hundreds or thousands of dollars in value in 2014 would agree with you!
@_date: 2014-11-18 21:27:22
The best form of money ever created, that can be completely wiped out if you lose your private key or someone tricks you into installing a remote access tool on your PC using one of thousands of different social engineering techniques. Yup.

Who keeps posting this shit about Russell Brand in here? Why am I supposed to care what this whiney liberal douche bag thinks about bitcoin?

Most companies realize that bitcoin is a niche payment network championed by a small community of fanatics, and don't want to go out of their way to associate themselves with it because of all the high profile thefts and other controversies.
You can still use it with wikipedia if you want, but most people don't. Because, what's the point?
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:46:47
So the message is... hey everyone, we know these exchanges get hacked all the time and lose customer money with zero recourse, but go ahead and use them anyway! Just don't store your money on them.
Instead, store it on your PC, which opens a dozen new paths for a hacker to steal them with malware or social engineering techniques. derp.

Please tell me again how it's safer to hold your money in bitcoin rather than government issued fiat.
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:58:13
That's not relevant. People don't understand how most technologies work in depth, but if they're useful, they're going to use them anyway. The problem is that they have no reason to buy bitcoin aside from gambling.

TCP/IP... and by extension... the Internet... was hugely successful and changed the face of the planet. Therefore bitcoin... which also needs a computer to operate... will also be hugely successful! 
Well, I'm convinced, thank you Mr. Egg Head!

I'm an ass because I refuse to use a currency with major security flaws written all over it? Drrr..
When it comes to money, nobody aside from a kool aid drinking bitcoin fanatic wants the hassle of backing up their "wallet", encrypting it, and carrying out a complex process of printing it out and storing multiple copies to store around the world (in case of a natural disaster, right)
and even then, it could still be compromised if the offline wallet is created on a compromised PC or it's stored in the cache of a network printer. Digital, unregulated currency... the best and worst idea ever.

That's good advice, but you forgot one thing. Don't invest in magic beans.

@_date: 2015-01-05 17:24:37
derp... how are users expected to obtain bitcoin in the first place if they're not to use exchanges?
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:56:37
Step right up folks to the wonderful world of bitcoin! The only practical use is for online gambling, and half the time, the site just takes your money since it's much more profitable for them to operate for a couple months, take all the deposits and run off than it is to operate a legitimate business.
But yeah, grandma is going to be trading into bitcoins to do her online shopping any day now I'm sure.

If your credit card gets stolen, you call your bank and have it cut. You're re-issued a new card immediately and are not liable for any losses. It's nothing more than an inconvenience.
On the other hand, I have read more than my fair share of truly heartbreaking stories from people who lost fortunes from exchanges or having their wallets hacked. There's no comparison.

In 2011, most people had not heard about bitcoin yet. Now, even my old grandmother knows what they are and heard about all the hacks and scams. Do you think that will make any difference?
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:09:34
Wee!!! Cheap coins!!!

Or just use these things... they're called cash, credit cards and banks.

In which case, you're at the mercy of the seller to not rip you off, which is a leap of faith for someone who is inexperienced with bitcoin.

February Headline on "New Backdoor Discovered on Third Party Bitcoin Hardware Wallets. Thousands of Coins Lost!"
And the comments will say, "who would be dumb enough to trust a product from a third party to store their bitcoins?" 
Why don't you guys just use an FDIC insured bank? You must be masochists or something.

The only things I use cash for these days is to hand my kids an allowance, pay for tips, or buy something on craigslist. Even on craigslist, I know where the person lives, but I mostly I just buy furniture and other odds and ends, which I first inspect, so I don't have problems.
With bitcoin, you send your digital cash and just hope that the other party delivers their end of the arrangement. It's risky and just dumb, given that there are other ways to shop online which provide recourse.

Are transactions going to become reversible in a few years? If not, then you can wait all you want, but bitcoin will never be ideal for mainstream use. But keep telling yourself otherwise, I'm sure someone will magically fix everything.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:14:19
I know the routine, you'll tell me next that extra fees will be involved once a payment processor steps in to ensure transactions. Which is fine, because that's what people want. That's why people use credit cards or Paypal online. they don't want to worry about being conned every time they buy something.

Because it's worth repeating, don't EVER click on links that you find in e-mails or online in bitcoin forums. This is a classic and effective approach used by hackers to phish information from users or direct them to malware hosting sites which can exploit software vulnerabilities on their systems.
