I realized I fucked it up, gone forever. It was only one bitcoin so not a huge deal but still frustrating. I sent it to a bitcoin address I generated using bitaddress.org and didn't save the import key. I thought that adding the address to my address book was all that needed to be done.

Thanks for the help, I am not too upset this was just a side project. It just seems a little dumbfounding how little information there is on beginners of bitcoins and it all seems so confusing.
May seem silly to say that and be blindly going into this type of trade but I even am a pretty computer-savvy person and some of this stuff is over my head.
I guess the best lessons are ones learned hardest.
At any rate  I bought the coin for $60 so it wasn't a gigantic loss.

I used Bitcoin-qt and sent it to my first address book address which it says is used for "Sending bitcoins"... I did not send it to my receiving address on bitcoin-qt.

also, would it just take a long time to receive or?

shouldve made that a reply sorry

True that

Yep it is my mistake no need to be a dick about it. I'm the one who learns hardest from this lesson.

Would anyone ever own that address again if I never imported it correctly?
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:02:43
how do I contact bitcoin-qt?
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:37:58
That's a logical perspective.
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:04:22
also if I generated the address randomly online myself wouldn't it be mine?
