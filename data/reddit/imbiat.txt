the most useful use for this would be storing my private keys, but that seems like a horrible idea, to make this work for me i'd have to give your service an encrypted message, and then give the way of decrypting the message only to the people who will get the message, maybe you could integrate with keybase.io and encrypt the messages that way.

it is possible that some of the coins are gone and other people have them because they were stolen from the exchange through transaction malleability attacks because mtgox had flaws in their system.  it is also possible that some of them are not gone but unaccessible due to a lost private key or lost cold storage wallet/usb drive/etc.
