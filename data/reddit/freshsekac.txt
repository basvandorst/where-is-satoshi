He's referring to the proper storage and custody aspect of storing bitcoin, not the blockchain.

If you'd like you can listen to some upper management from BlockFi in the following podcast. Tales From The Crypt  Zac Prince &amp; Rene van Kesteren - its a really good podcast and they speak about the interest account and there risk management along with other Bitcoin topics.

I listened to it a few days ago but from what I remember: Gemini does all of there custody (so you can go look them up), during the crash from 6k to low 3k there risk management system worked really well according to them, they also are backed by some more traditional financial institutions that are getting in the space, they didn't give exact names but eluded too companies like Fidelity and ICE. That is what I can remember but you should really give it a listen its kinda long but super interesting, the talk about BlockFi and Bitcoin in general, highly recommend.

Can you dive a bit deeper into this?

I would be more worried about gold backed Yuan. As China has been accumulating lots of gold (way more than the US).

GitHub focuses on code I just wanted to have a more open ended discussion. Including a variety of factors that may not be adjustable through making changes to Bitcoin itself.

I would say it really depends, maybe in the future when bitcoin is more understood it would be beneficial for adoption but typically when a financial crisis happens people sell their most speculative assets (in this case probably being Bitcoin) and resort to something that has stood the test of time like gold. Long run it would probably be good because it would further increase the distrust of FIAT and the govs ability to manage money, yet in the short term we might see a dump by people who don't truly understand Bitcoin or believe it's to volatile in its current state. Also depends if its inflationary vs deflationary, we could see a situation like in Venezuela where there is speculation of gov officials printing money and dumping it into bitcoin to escape their rapidly inflating currency. We can see this as their has been up to a 70% premium for Bitcoin in Venezuela over the past year, meaning the demand is clearly high.

Buy a ledger nano S or Trezor (one or t) but be careful you buy it off the actual website. If you have more than what the wallet costs in terms of crypto then it is well worth the investment especially if you plan on buying more. It's not too technical and their are tons of tutorials online. Good luck!

If your planning on holding it for a while, these day to day swings won't make a huge difference in the big picture. I would just set up a plan and stick to it, if you think it's a good price just buy a little more that week.

You could ask that about any market, not quite how it works. You could make the argument that Bitcoin would be easy to manipulate but still.
@_date: 2019-04-11 18:16:50
I would just buy a little every week, average your way in, no one can perfectly time any market.

They settled the short OTC instead of through market, if they started closing a 30 million dollar position (this would mean they would have to buy 6000 bitcoin) they would cause the price to rise, creating slippage, thus losing a lot of $$.
