May I help you? :)

Small clarification:
- CLTV: Check Lock Time Verify. It's a bit like the CSV everyone is talking about, but rely's on a timestamp instead of the number of blocks mined.
- dead-man's switch: I think everyone holding significant amounts of BTC should have something like that: a way for your loved ones to access your BTC in case something bad happens to you (death, coma, amnesia, etc.)
Bitcoin transactions contains scripts. The idea is to create transactions which operates like a special kind of multisig:
Key X can spend the outputs at any moment.
Key Y is limited by a CLTV, which forces it to wait for some point T in the future.
This way, you (holder of key X) have access to your funds at any time.
But if you do not spend them before T, then the holder of key Y (your loved ones) will be able to spend the funds too.
So you can set T something like one month in the future, and then every month, if you haven't spent the outputs yet, you put them in a new transaction with T=T+1 month.
You manually postpone key Y access to the funds until something bad happens to you, and you won't be here to postpone it again.
(Key X and key Y could actually be more complex scripts (like multi-sig) themselves, but let's keep it simple and not go there)
Not sure if I'm really clear.

Tried out  and got surprised at checkout.
Here is their ad on Reddit which brought me there : 
Edit : I can't review the product itself for now, I'm overseas and haven't received it yet.
Checkout went well, as always with Bitpay.

It does not modify the Bitcoin protocol, it is a layer on top of it.
No need for a BIP.
