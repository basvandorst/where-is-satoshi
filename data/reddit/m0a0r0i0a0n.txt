That is a nice chart!
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:27:18
This is not just a simple spike! lets be honest, bitcoin is having hard times and my reason for my panic is this :
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:27:25


So for a 3$ profit you understand that have to pay 13$ in transfer/transaction fees....
For 100$ investment I would recommend you to get any other coin rather than bitcoin, this if you want fast profits ,as for now buying 100$ will get you around 85$ in bitcoins, fees are high and bitcoin will have to increase by 1000$ so that you can get 3$ profit.

Why would you not?
Do you really believe that Bitmex - never heard of them) and not even listed on any major exchange will be that stupid to sell BCH when the price is about to boom?
Do you believe that is a coincidence that they spread this news right when BCH become more profitable to mine?
If they really have BCH for sale, be sure that they dumped quietly and realized the mistake they have done, no investor will give news when they want to dump... especially now when coin is rising.

Reddit has lot of trolls because but today noticed many trolls from BTC, all kind of peoples trying to prove bitcoins power, this confirm me some of my thoughts: In couple hours some alts will be more profitable to mine and BTC trolls are afraid that most of the miners are leaving BTC, but miners are not controlling BTC !!! In my opinion people who invested 100-10000$ are biggest trolls ever. 
Bitcoin is more than a coin, it has become the symbol of the internet and it will not die, but now people having lot of experience and now that we have another bitcoin for the price of 1300$ ...who dosent want that? think about it... miners want more profits, and they know that once ACchanging side, maybe BTC will drop so yes will be cheap BTC .
Be smart and make monies, invest in cheap bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:10:46
Could that be? Again ...fck
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:18:10
This might be a reason aswell
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:33:58
5 Bitcoins doesn't seem that much to you?
For how long have you been hostage :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:27:53
I want to know that too!! spit it out
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:41:28
Just for asking a simple question... did I show any signs of panic or whatever?
On the other side you seems to be really freaked, why?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:23:19
Price is already rocketing and we are approaching new ATH
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:45:04
Are you crazy??? is a reddit link!
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:20:23
The SegWit2x chain is currently sitting at block height of 494782, waiting for the first &gt;2MB block to be mined.
The SegWit2x chain is currently lagging the main chain by 7 blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:55:25
I understand that, is just that people are way to rude here, and I got lots of down votes for this.
Just trying to share what I found and to keep other bitcoins believers out of that scam coin
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:48:17
Not particularly about bcash, just angry because can`t read anything without trolls spamming 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:14:12
Maybe... anyway is a good thing, will help increase for the price
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:06:56
To the sky and more, and good that I god rid of altcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:42:02
exactly, and that is not good...
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:00:17
I also lost a lot but got out in time as I spoted something and tried to warn peoples here, but got only down votes :( and have only 250 views, so sorry guys..
Here is my reditt:
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:26:38
408,928 readers on -Bitcoin- Reddit. 
Bitcoin is having hard times, 20k users online and you are listing this?!
Is not this post same as spreading FUD about Bitcoin in media? Pr attack to slow down adoption... your list, your words.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:50:38
Yes, sorry but can not edit anymore
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:19:36
But who knows BCH is being pumped instantly at even smallest drop of BTC, this made me to drop all, is too dangerous to hold BCH as is heavy manipulated
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:16:52
one good article, never thought to look this way at charts.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:23:05
Yes money, he might bought lot of BCH and sold at 2500$, but he sold in BTC and now has even more more BTC, that means even more BTC. 
Question is, will it hold or sell? If he is selling I doubt that will be for BCH again, investors lost hope
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:09:06
I sold my BTC for BCH, and when I realised that is a big elaborated scam I sold in time my BCH and bought BTC again and now with this increase I`m back on track. Could have been worse....
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:40:25
Can you not see all the problems and attacks that bitcoin having?
I`m a bitcoin HODL but every week I read 90% bad news about bitcoin, I`m starting to lose hope and definitely believe that there will be another big dump!
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:22:05
Maybe is more profitable and easier to get BTC instead getting dollars then BTC, would you not say the same?
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:19:37
Hope is not, numbers rising fast, 5k since I posted this? too fast... 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:24:54
How do they lost it? Can`t find the keys or...they bought high and sold cheap??
well this is trading! it happens in bitcoin too, happened this weekend, did not saw any post complaining, moderators must be doing a great job
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:23:18
I will
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:50:05
I will not post anything then...
Looks huge deal for me as I watched BCH and ETH all day and suddenly strange things happened, sell wallet for BCH increased and buy price orders were higher than sell orders.
Never mind...
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:10:53
Is not that fast at this cap, if we had a price of 4k per coin then we should worry but I can see only good thing for now
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:21:03
Not yet... anyway unconfirmed transactions starting to clear, reached 85k and now 78k, so rising stopped
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:10:15
I have a bad feeling about this... all this war and all this news, attacks are to drop bitcoin down and I`m afraid that will be a blood bath soon... or this negativism might be from London weather :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:23:08


fee started to increase now and unconfirmed transactions rising slower now, so is okay...
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:07:30
I know that :(
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:17:37
I think he is with the monies, where is more profit 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:58:35
Block size increase?? Is more profitable to stay this way, fees are enormous! 
 = to be a store of value where higher fees don't matter (settlement layer)
 = to be a zero-low fee payment channel (visa/mastercard/paypal use cases)
In the contrary, the BTC network has an artificial limitation along with a tainted history of being backed up with unconfirmed transactions and is in dire need of a solution. On the same token, BTC is accused by BCH believers to be centralized at the top and thus does not allow for bitcoin to scale like originally designed (only the tip of the political iceberg).
Whether lightning network and/or drive/side chains that layer on top of the bitcoin blockchain, BTC is in a proverbial race against time to solve the next puzzle piece when it comes becoming a store of value and a medium of payment exchange like BCH aims to do.
The Bitcoin Cash fork has caught many people by surprise and has sent facts like bitcoin's 150,000+ unconfirmed transactions 
Okay so Iam a bitcoin believer but reading more and more , starting to lose confidence and looking for alternatives before is too late.
Someone explained me this about block and about BCH over BTC - he said to imagine that I`m in a car and why would I pick a slow jammed and taxed road(bitcoin blocks) over a free and fast clear highway(bitcoin cash blocks)....
Well said! and all make sense now 
2mb blocks = the blockchain growing twice as fast…
The blockchain growing twice as fast = faster onset of centralisation…
We don't want centralisation…
We don't want regulation… 
So 2mb blocks are going to destroy bitcoin twice as fast as 1mb blocks, especially with the ddosing of the btc network, will not happen, SegWit2x failed and they know why.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:26:55
 Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:08:59
I would not refuse that.... bring it!
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:50:02
I will not post anything then...
Looks huge deal for me as I watched BCH and ETH all day and suddenly strange things happened, sell wallet for BCH increased and buy price orders were higher than sell orders.

@_date: 2017-11-16 19:50:58
I will, I`m again 100% convinced that bitcoin can`t be changed, is too powerful and it will always be.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:29:24
THIS PROVES THAT BITCOIN IS THE REAL COIN AND BCH IS MANIPULATED
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:10:06
I am sure that Bitcoin will not die and this unconfirmed transactions might mean that price will go up as many are buying
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:58:58
I hope that will be an unofficial international currency in future, after all he has no borders, and now I suspect that only 15% of world population is aware of his existence.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:54:55
This was the right way to do, only that I did not sell on time and had faith that BCH will return somehow, that will be pumped.
That guy Roger who manipulates the coin has second largest volume of bitcoins 300.000! so I thought that have lot of BCH and will somehow drag BTC down to be the new Satoshi... he can`t do this apparently or maybe cashed out at the top, who knows
