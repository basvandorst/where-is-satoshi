I am currently reading Intelligent Investor. I agree with your post.
It's interesting how this sub calls Buffet an idiot unless they can take one of his quotes out of context.

One example would be Gaddafi suggested making an African currency backed by gold to trade all oil in. This would have caused major problems for the value of the dollar so the US military handled the threat to its currency.

Can you recommend a way to measure the output of an economy? And how does our debt compared to thats ratio compare to other economies?
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:45:40
Neat! So using these analytics how does the US economy compare to other economies?

From wikipedia?
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:56:09
And as a follow up: Hows the debt to the-new-analytic-of-your-choice compare to other countries?
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:40:59
I mean...thats not true. Maybe in pure $ amount. But as a percentage of GDP there are many countries with wildly more debt than the US.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:36:32
I just started reading "The Intelligent Investor". Its a book Warren Buffett highly recommends. This sub likes to shit on Buffett for not buying into the tech bubble but they talk about it extensively in the book. He points out its easy to see something will change the future but its hard to know which player will win. 
They point out the tech bubble was reminiscent of the airplane bubble. In the '50s everyone knew passenger flights were the way of the future but picking which company would be profitable was impossible. Sure enough most companies failed. Same with tech. These cycles have been going on forever. The first horseless carriage was steam powered and built in the 1700s...I pity the investors who bought into that sure thing.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:35:38
Not pretending. Thats what I believe. When evaluating someone or a nations ability to pay back a loan, taking into consideration their ability to pay is everything.

Lol. These people are delusional.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:49:50
Debt compared to how much you produce is a terrible way to gauge things? Are you just trolling?

"If you had put in $100 into bitcoin...you'd have like...$100 million"
Thats not even true if you had bought in at $1...

That's true. So carrying a handful of silver coins and going out back with an axe to cut one for change is more cumbersome than...it don't even fucking know how to buy Bitcoin, much less transfer it to someone. And I spent days trying to buy some back in the day.

@_date: 2018-08-14 21:01:55
There are no fundamentals to look at (except maybe adoption as a currency by big name stores). For example: Maybe if steam started accepting it again, it would inspire confidence. But without true fundamentals it's impossible to know.

Sure! it's refreshing to see someone willing to learn.
"The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham has a great forward by him. This book is the cornerstone of evaluating an investment. "Richest Man in Babylon" is a good starter for just how to think about investments. It can be read in an afternoon.

@_date: 2018-05-07 17:44:22
Some quotes I enjoyed from the articles:
Buffett told CNBC that bitcoin was "probably rat poison squared."
During the meeting itself, Buffett joked that "if you had bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it, it's a couple tenths of a percent." 
He also responded to a question from the audience about bitcoin by saying that it and other crytpocurrencies "will come to bad endings."
"I like cryptocurrencies a lot less than you do," Munger said to Buffett. "To me, it's just dementia. It's like somebody else is trading turds and you decide you can't be left out."
@_date: 2018-05-07 21:23:15
The point I was trying to make is that OP is saying coins have inherent value and then goes on to describe the tech. I agree the tech might have value but the coins have no inherent value. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:06:14
I mean, Buffett did. And 95% of .com stock crashed to nothing.
@_date: 2018-05-07 19:04:52

Doubtful. He bought 75 million shares of apple a few days ago. He made $575 million dollars just from the market shifting up on apple after news he bought it. 
He legit hates crypto. He has seen too many bubbles. A lot of people will talk about the .com bubble but Buffett talks about bubbles going back to the airplane bubble of the '50s. Dude knows his stuff.
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:08:28
Huh. TIL. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:21:46
I've read his books?
I can imagine what he would say because he has written about it time and again. When you invest in something, the number 1 rule is to not lose your money. If theres a chance you could lose everything on an investment, dont buy it. So crypto is out the door after rule 1. When you buy an investment, it's assets should be worth what you are spending. Tangible assets. Buffett didnt buy apple stock because he thinks the new iphone will be good. He bought it because he believes the buildings, tech, patents, equipment, etc are worth what he is paying. If they went under tomorrow, he believes he can make his money back anyway.
Moving on to crypto. When looking at it, he might agree crypto or blockchain are the future. Neat! So which one or brand will be the winner? As he writes in the forward of "Intelligent Investor", it's easy to see an industry will be big. It's much harder to pick the actual companies or products that will win in that market space. Like airfare in the '50s, .com stocks in the 90s and crypto now. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 19:44:20
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:27:47
So a movie is a product. If its good, it has value. If its not, it doesnt? I agree. How does this prove made up internet money has value? If bitcoin went under, what tangible asset will I still have?
@_date: 2018-05-07 19:51:09
I'll tell him. He might not be aware.
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:40:37

@_date: 2018-05-29 16:44:30
Everyone I know that's still holding is just waiting to get back to the point where they bought in so they can sell at break even point.
Bitcoin is going to have tiers of resistance all the way back up to 19k. If it ever reaches that again.
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:39:37
So it's the tech, not the coins?
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:42:35

@_date: 2018-05-27 02:00:35

Yes. That is what I mean by controlling.


They dont give a shit. They just want to make money off of people who think theyve figured out something others havent.


Just a statement. You can take that as an attack.  Putin is expected to have over $200 billion in assets alone. Bitcoin market cap is $250 billlion. If these guys got together, they could control this market with ease. Probably by controlling a tiny fraction of the market cap.


Thats an understatement.




How does high price = adoption.

Correct. because neither has anything but an idea when you buy it. There is no underlying tangible asset. If it goes to zero, it goes to zero. When a company goes to zero (if its worth investing in) it has buildings, equipment, patents etc to sell.

Fair enough. I dont believe in bitcoin personally. I am very intrigued by it and believe it has planted a seed that cant be taken back. Internet will change our money one day.

Sometimes you have to sell. If the stock market tanked 40% tomorrow, some people panic sell but the bigger picture is that investment in new businesses grind to a halt and there are layoffs in most industries to balance the budgets. People lose their jobs. Four months later you have a choice...sell at a loss to continue paying your mortgage or lose your house because your savings have run out. No one is hiring. Theres 120 applicants for every job you're qualified for. 'Panic selling' and selling at a loss arent always dumb panicked people. It's mostly people trying to stay afloat.
Bitcoin is high right now. I congratulate all the people that took on the risk to drive it this high and they deserve their profits. But being successful in a bull market is a no brainer. If you invested in anything from housing to bitcoin to stock market to magic cards 5 years ago you are probably doing well.

An old beggar who regularly patrolled the street in front of my office now gave me tips and, I suppose, spent the money I and others gave him in the market. My cook had a brokerage account and followed the ticker closely. Her paper profits were quickly blown away in the gale of 1929."

Your net worth is adjusting all the time. Gains and losses are real, whether realized or not. 
"Realized Gains and Losses
Gains or losses are said to be "realized" when a stock is sold. This is especially important from a tax perspective as, in general, capital gains are taxed only when they are realized. Unrealized gains and losses are also commonly known as "paper" profits or losses, which implies that the gain/loss is only real "on paper." This may be true from a tax perspective, but remember that a loss is a loss, whether it's been realized or not."-investopedia

This was your original comment. It ignores that gold was the defacto currency for many cultures across the globe for thousands of years. It was mass adopted. It is no longer a currency but its price memory partial stems from its mass adoption in the past. It retains halo effect as a store of wealth. I get where youre coming from better now though.
I will answer your other response here to keep things organized. You make a respectable argument but I disagree. We have learned that a good currency has some inflation. Deflation is not a healthy aspect of a currency. Nor is stagnant value.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:13:28
One of the biggest takeaways I have learned from the bitcoin experiment is how important healthy inflation is to a well functioning currency and economy.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:34:13
Yes. Just think. Perhaps one day museums around the world will be filled with art made from bitcoin as a sign of wealth for millenia. One day fiat will be backed with vaults full of bitcoin. People will wear bitcoin as a sign of wealth. Movies will end with the adventurer finding rooms filled with ancient bitcoin.
People in this thread have pointed out your stupidity. But no one has pointed out how, when proven wrong, you double down rather than learn a lesson. Such a fine quality in a person. Especially an investor!

I think people are realizing there is no confidence whatsoever in this currency. Confidence is the most important thing to a currency and bitcoin has none now. It is  correcting to where a useless but interesting experiment should be: near 0. The few people left with sense are selling while they still can and discovering there are less fools willing to buy than before. So it is not only crashing, but crashing in leaps and bounds down to where the few fools left are willing to buy.

Bitcoin has been a fun wild ride from the outside looking in. It has made me question a lot of what I knew about currency, markets, FOMO behavior, herd investing etc. A lot of interesting theory played out over the last 14 months. It's taught me life lessons and solidified others I already knew. 
I feel bad for a lot of people involved in it all, but I am glad I got to watch it. It may have even planted a seed that may eventually lead to something challenging the worlds current currency models.

Inflation affects economies in various positive and negative ways. The negative effects of inflation include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money, uncertainty over future inflation which may discourage investment and savings, and if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. Positive effects include reducing the real burden of public and private debt, keeping nominal interest rates above zero so that central banks can adjust interest rates to stabilize the economy, and reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity.[5]

Warren Buffett gets a lot of heat in this sub for not investing in Amazon. When asked about it he said it was simple to see the tech would win but impossible to pick actual winners. He said it reminded him a lot of the commercial airplane revolution in the '50s. Everyone knew it was the future...but which companies to pick to buy? No investors made a profit on commercial airplanes in the '50s.

Kinda. It kinda still is. Amazon doesnt pay a dividend yet/still right? But stocks have underlying assets that can be sold off and paid out to investors in the event of a bankruptcy. Stocks also pay you a dividend while you hold them. Thats what makes them an investment. 
If you're about to compare crypto to tech stocks, be aware that that was also a bubble. 95% of tech stocks went under. At the time there was no way to know whether pets.com or amazon would go under. Wise investors stayed away.

Thats sounds good.


Because it's lost 95% of it's confidence? or because more was made?
I think you're starting with a point you want to make, and then finding ways to support that claim, instead of looking at all the facts and drawing conclusions from that.

Well, if you had bought at 7k and sold at 19k, you'd be very rich. So the first two sentences are correct.
When people saw it crash back down, people realized it wasnt very stable and their confidence in it went away. They realized even if they bought now at 7k, it might not go to 19k again. So the 3rd and 4th sentences make sense too.
All the statements were fair when they were said.
