what if the person you want to send money to is on a different lightning network.  Do we all need to be on the same lightning network?
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:41:25
are there any networks that work outside of coins implementing atomic swaps?  Or a DecEx for ERC20 tokens?  
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:40:56
are you saying there will only be 1 lightning network channel?
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:08:17
Yeah screw those people running a company needing to make revenue

Every time i think i've learned a lot about bitcoin and crypto i hear entirely new aspects I need to look up :( :)

I don't think saving a couple bucks on an iPad is a game changer. It would have to be significant saving to get me to purchase from someone other than amazon who I am already comfortable with

Aren't they money transmitters because they deal in USD or whatever fiat currency? Not because of the bitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:08:44
Right but we don't have that yet, i was responding to the "Fuck ebay for having the gall to charge a fee" comment, ignoring the fact that even with that 10% fee we still have a much better system available to us than we did before.  If you wanted to sell something before it was basically pawn shops or craigslist.

Coinmkt, mtgox both got me.
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:57:35


yes this is the part that makes people not so confident in just investing in bitcoin.

What would you suggest as an appropriate salary to develop a crypto currency full time? Minimum wage?
@_date: 2014-12-03 02:22:07
The average person would have no idea what this image is showing.

Yeah i actually can't figure out what apple and google mean by "encrypted".  I'm still being served ads in gmail which means they can still read my content which means its not encrypted at all.  What exactly is being encrypted?

How does using btc make any difference?
@_date: 2014-04-24 22:34:00
That's the rub.  The current bitcoin situation provides all the downsides of banking with none of the benefits.
@_date: 2014-12-30 07:52:19
Ok so on this page  where it says 


You could have one of the outputs of the transaction be the same as the input (your own address)?  Does the transaction referenced in that page just use a new output for a change address for better security/privacy best practice?
@_date: 2014-12-30 07:53:54
I'm not concerned with the privacy of it, I have a separate wallet with separate coins in case the need for anonymity arises.  When you say "to a small extent, its security" what do you mean?
And as far as using the input of the transaction as the second output (using the sender as the change address) is there anything in the bitcoin protocol that would discourage it?  
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:33:35
Doesn't sound so convenient
@_date: 2014-10-18 14:30:04
If they can read it once then they can decrypt it for the government. There's no security in that scenario. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:59:46
Agreed.  When everyone says that theres so much money being invested in bitcoin businesses, I don't think they're bitcoin businesses, i think they're crypto-currency businesses.  If bitcoin flops, those comapnies can move over to whatever other currency becomes popular and those technologies and businesses are still valuble.  Any bitcoins you may have bought won't be though.
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:40:41


No, it's really not.

The original quote was about the systematic extermination of people for nothing more than their religious or social birth status.  The new one is about people being arrested for breaking laws that you don't personally agree with.

yeah i wouldnt trust Math.random in the browser to actually be random, though they do offer a crypto class now.  Keybase doesn't seem to think that's enough so they've added this which just pulls more randomness from timing events:  but i dont know enough about math to know whetehr this helps or hurts
The SecureRandom class just pulls from /dev/random, which I can't imagine getting any more random than that, but if that's not good enough I'd love to know what is.
@_date: 2015-01-09 16:58:19
That actually sounds like a pretty good proposal. It's pretty fucked up to spread info about him hiring a hit man and then expect a jury to give him a fair trial on drug charges
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:40:37
How would someone find themselves not using a truly random number generator? Isn't that the job of the operating system? I've been doing some crypto stuff in Java using the SecureRandom class, under the impression that the operating system ensures that this is as random as necessary for crypto.  
is the problem that you need to go above and beyond this amount of randomness, or would it be that they weren't using this and were doing something else?

Hopefully popcorn time is being used simply because is widely used so you can bootstrap on it. They're inventing a technology that can be used to create a global file store for private stuff. At least that's what I think maybe they're just making a stronger pirating system.

Running any code requires a tiny amount of gas (ether) which would prohibit this endless growth... without someone constantly feeding money into it this type of "virus" would just fizzle out and be ignored.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:10:30
did you ever find the answer to this?  I'd like to store one key on my crypto-steel and use it on all hardware wallets
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:20:47
what is the security risk?
