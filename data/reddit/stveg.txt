Once again, the block chain lets you know.

Mmm, my fees are that high, honey. ;D

If the reputation of anonymous markets would be significantly damaged by less than advertised products, then Silk Road would have disappeared long ago. There are many vendors that sell poor products, but the vendors that provide incredible products outshine these poor vendors infinitely. No one gives a shit that there's some bad apples in the basket.

Have you considered removing the need for verification to purchase bitcoins with cash?
It would be a lot more appealing to me if your service did not need a verified phone number and mailing address.

This reminds me of [Bandcamp]( of which I am a huge fan of. I would love to see a site like this implemented with BTC.

Why are you posting an article from the onion on here?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:42:32
Good point, I forgot about Electrum.

This concern is not unique to bitcoin, though.

Any bank that accepts cash deposits is inevitably going to launder money.

He was lucky in that it saved him money, but this would have happened even if it wasn't saving him money.

What exactly is the core purpose of bitcoin? If you think it is to shut out people from the market that you don't like - Winkelvoss twins - then you're mistaken. Most bitcoin enthusiasts enjoy the aspect that bitcoin allows for a freer market. If in that market some "rich douchebags" decide to create an ETF and you don't like it, then don't participate in it.

All MoneyGram payments are done at customer service. So you can only pay when the customer service desk is open.

Let's say you are wanting to transfer X coins, either to or from your wallet. The block chain will have to confirm the transaction. If there are no confirmations, then the transaction will not resolve. If the transaction does not resolve then you will know because your wallet balance did not change by X coins.

Have you never heard of the capital gains tax? If not, here's some information you might find interesting:

115.08 USD

For the most part, it still is.

The only people who get recognition for their tax advice are those saying you must pay capital gains if you sell your bitcoins for fiat currency. This is solid advice.
Aside from that, this article does not say anything about bitcoin, making it off-topic. Secondly, it is an article from the onion, making it more off-topic.
There is no reason to post an article from a satire news source that doesn't mention bitcoin.

Or scrap all their equipment and sell it.

There is no incentive to lace drugs with anything dangerous. Even if someone did the customers would destroy the reputation of the vendor, and no one would purchase from them again. 
The vendors that lace drugs with similar drugs to reduce costs will again receive a lower reputation and lose sales.

Not everyone wants to download the block chain to their computer, because it is rather large.
