BTCUSDSHORTS and BTCUSDLONGS are datasets provided by Bitfinex exchange. But the names are misleading. They do not record the number of longs and shorts and they are not directly tradeable.
They record the number of *margined* longs and shorts, measured in **BTCs**.
Example: on 2018-04-22  BTCUSDLONGS closed at 28341.8851 and BTCUSDSHORTS closed at 24171.6528. This tells us that the value of margined longs held at Bitfinex was worth 28341.8851 Bitcoins. You might infer bullish sentiment at that moment because BTCUSDLONGS exceeded BTCUSDSHORTS. But note that the information says nothing about how many traders were involved nor how many longs and shorts. Theoretically, the entire BTCUSDLONGS position (28341.8851 BTC) could be held by just one margin trader, and total longs (ie margined longs + unmargined longs) could be any reasonable number you might imagine. The same conclusions apply to BTCUSDSHORTS.
Their main function is as an indicator. When both BTCUSDSHORTS and BTCUSDLONGS are shown in a single window, you have a crude indicator of market sentiment and historic popularity.

The misheld belief that longs have to equal shorts is a blowover from futures markets. The concept doesn’t apply in spot markets. So, even if the misleading names had referred to total longs and shorts, there is no necessity for them to be equal.
