Well this does a good job of highlighting that blocks are getting full, which we knew they would for years and we knew this would happen around right now since at least last year.
Why are people upset?
When the temporary data cap was added it was so much larger than the data usage that it was never intended to be constantly hit. The chief developer of btc at that time, Satoshi, said it could be raised if hit. That it wasn't fixed right away was not a problem as we all agreed on a vision of raising the limit when hit.
I think that is the crux of the disagreement.

Thanks, it's been a while since I read all these. So I see I can't take my secret key and use a password to create a BIP38 key pair.
It looks like I'm wrong about not being able to generate a mnemonic on a preexisting secret key. What was I thinking of? Those micro keys that casuscus used? No I think it's that you can't HD a non HD key
I haven't looked for a while, what are good resources for generating HD keys? Hardware or software wallets I bet could be used, would they be any more trustworthy than a client side website?

lol no idea what you are talking about, we've seen a couple studies showing Bitcoin can increase the data cap to 2-4MB without greatly hurting any  mining decentralization.
Gavin pointed out this problem was coming like 5 years ago, then he said our blocks would be getting full in a  year about a year ago. 
It looks like he is trying to fix a problem and a bunch on uninformed trolls are trying to stop him for some unknown reason, as there is no danger.
@_date: 2016-04-01 01:17:16
I've read it, my understanding is that you can't just take a secret key and turn it into a mnemonic. That is has to be generated with that ability. 
I am unaware of a AES encryption of preexisting secret keys, how can I go about performing this action? 
If bitaddress.org had an HD wallet creation I think it would go a long way to moving people away from key pairs.

Well as shown by example of GHash when pools approach 50% people leave them, but a pool really only need what 25-30% to potentially do things.

I argue that at least 95% of a company's bitcoin storage should be in cold storage. 
At this point it should be similar to establishing physical control of that cold storage, like a bank vault, if there are any rules on that.
The keys that are used should be a threshold or multisig in the customers favor. They should be generated securely and only the address is ever moved until the coins are to be spent. Secure generation means using shielded electronics, more than 10 feet from walls, in rooms with no outside views or windows. Firmware exploits or hardware viruses could be in some systems that the NSA had access to, can they be trusted?
I'm not sure how to generate the key in a way that each side has access to what they need by not the information of the other party.

I sometimes poorly moderate the entrenched community of and I would like to say that there is nothing you can do with reddit's current system that can't be gamed quickly. Except for many user generated lists of RES tags that are cross referenced you are unlikely to discover anything and even if you do they can start again, they are hydra.
Use RES on your own is probably your best bet. account age and activity are very poor and easily manipulated variable.
As mentioned by someone else, try going into posts from the big price rise and taging people who lost a lot of money.

I think we've been in different forums. As far as I can tell *no one* is for keeping the 1 mb block long term. Instead everyone agrees it must be raised but how to do it in a responsible way is the question.
Any static increase, 3, 8, 20, 21mbs, they will all need to be changed later on and are bad choices. But some feel we are running low on time, so we should push the danger further away and investigate more on a long term solution.
Then others want to come up with that long term solution now, so that the number of hard forks in the future is less. This seems like a good option but then the question becomes if such a system could get adequate testing before launch.    
But before we can address that the aforementioned long term solution must be found. People don't want something that can be manipulated, so it would have to be tied to some other value, the question then is what to peg it to and how. Perhaps a number of metrics, but it would need to be resistant to stalls and surges in the network and usage.
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:33:12
I guess I would have thought that once a address receives bitcoin then that address has a balance of that amount of btc. I understand how as address is derived and that the address isn't used to send btc but when storing a UTXO in a PK that can be represented by an address then would't that mean that address has a balance of whatever the value of the utxo is?

@_date: 2015-06-27 17:47:09
I think we have a misunderstanding here. I am talking about sending 1 satoshi, with the implication that you need to pay a fee to make a tx. I know free txs can go through if a miner that is willing mines it but if we disregard this due to it's long wait and possible not going through then to send 1 satoshi mean that if I want to spend that satoshi I need to pay a small fee to have it sent but there is nothing to give as fee. the later implies a hashed tx with P2SH that enables a later tx to cover the fee of an earlier one (Child pay for parent?)
I'm saying if you send 1 satsoshi then it is hard to spend, because most miners require a fee and 1 S in an address byitself leaves no room for said fee. but it may be possible to still spend with a scripted tx I though
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:55:08

I don't think so, this is a weighted vote, so you take a test on subject B and if you get a %60 correct answer rate then your vote counts for 0.6 value points but if you only answer 5% of the questions right your weight is less. those more knowledgeable on a subject have more influence, of course this proposes many many more problems.

	NIST recommended a different curve, P-256, and that's what basically everyone used when Bitcoin was created. secp256k1 was used almost nowhere. There were even calls to change Bitcoin's curve since secp256k1 was so strange
But later on, years after Satoshi disappeared, it was discovered that all of the NIST-recommended curves were constructed in a very suspicious way and have an uncomfortably high likelihood of containing a backdoor.    
 Secp256k1 was probably one of the most secure standardized curves that Satoshi could have chosen in 2009, but this fact was not publicly known in 2009. Was he just lucky, or did he somehow have insider knowledge?"

We believe that the adoption of digital money is inevitable." But they also mention they think a government issued currency would be better than current cash.
it says "ability to automatically embed automated tax collection at the tx level"
I think this could be possible by having an atomic unit that is only available to the authorized users and the public can only use half of the available decimals.
It seems clear they will at least try this somewhere with a government issued digency (digital currency)
they mention that they don't believe the market can handle reaching the unbanked and such on it's own.
they also state that without intervention of bitcoin it can't do what they want, which is for the banks and government to be at the center of this new technological shift.

@_date: 2016-03-20 18:31:59
I see things entirely different, I see that a solution was presented to a long ignored problem but discussion of that solution was censored and we never got to discuss the solution rationally. If anyone is trying to forcibly take over btc to change it from what it was designed to do then some of the coredevelopers are who I would see as far more culpable. 
That being said, without big changes I don't think nodes will be able to be used by everyone, certainly not if you want the btc envisioned in the whitepaper.
[In this post]( I argue that nodes will have to be closer to the data centers predicted by Satoshi. That isn't bad, there can still be many more nodes in many places but if we try to stick to everyone running a node then btc isn't a e-cash or even and e-gold it's a small hobby system. In a similar vein why should the world not develop VR content just because the ISPs in america are too slow to let it be used?
The barriers to entry don't start on nodes, nodes are somethng only experienced users will host, wallets are the barrier to entry and access to coins itself. that's what should be easy, we shouldn't cripple the system

@_date: 2016-03-20 18:37:09
I think OP is trying to create a physcial btc or other paper wallet, for that purpose it is a use once piggy bank. 
The problem with this is you usally have to own the manufacturing abilites or make all key pairs in advance. If you have the machines you can wait until a user gives you their encryopted key and print it, if you don't have the equipment you have to make a bunch of secure keys and promise you didn't keep a copy like cassious and kialara coins.
@_date: 2016-03-12 18:30:50
That's not the point, it's that censorship fostered infighting and now the community is divided and pit against itself. The community is toxic, this webforum has single handedly turned people away from btc.
Just because it isn't happing all the time at full visibility doens't mean there aren't scars from it happening
@_date: 2016-01-07 01:51:59
Fees aren't supposed to grow, they are supposed to remain low to enable micropayments, it is the large number of people using bitcoin that pays miners. Isn't that what the whitepaper spells out? What Satoshi talked about? What got us all into this?
You're talking about some kind of money order system, that is not what we are here for.
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:47:31
Fees have gone up, the push to artificially create a fee market while the coinbase reward is still high has made some progress.
From reading Satoshi's words it is my understanding that Satoshi always intended for fees to be low, with the possibility of creating free txs that would take longer to confirm.
So I think this direction is a change from the initial vision of btc, and for that reason I am upset that we are starting down this slippery slope. It might not be so bad right now, but it's the whole I didn't do anything when they came for the X because I wasn't X argument. If we don't try to keep btc working like it was designed we will soon look to find a system far different than what was envisioned.
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:01:20
Dude, I mean I get your fanatical obsession with szabo and nash but I think you need to take a vacation or something. 
so, SN is rich perhaps but he also pretty much can't spend any of his btc. unless he has other btc that he mined with a different computers then if he goes to spend any of this coins we will know and it could crash btc. So is he really rich? He has money but can't spend it, I don't think do then.
The analysis suggest SN has around 1 million btc, maybe 1.1; that's half a billion so he isn't a billionaire, this would have been easier to figure out then write what you did about it. &gt; owner can secretly walk around a millionaire (probably already or at least soon to be billionaire) 
this is bad grammar &gt;Szabo separate’s a much larger thesis
I agree that modularity is growing with btc, and I think that it will go further than you describe, I can see a world where every aspect of the system is done by it's own module. Full node data centers, miner data centers, smart device wallets, network connections on everything. Things will continue to separate.
I thought we knew pretty sure how the pyramids were built? earthen ramps that wrapped around the building were used to make a big step pyramid like the ones in mexico, then the pathways were filled in from the top down. Microgravity readings from like 20 years ago show there is evidence of these chambers. They also found something under the Sphynx but the gov wouldn't let them do any more looking.

I think you misconstrue FUD with real concerns. And people wanting to push core devs away want so only because their inaction has led us to this predicted point.
These people providing rational and detailed reports aren't trying to hurt btc they are trying to do the exact opposite, based on real concerns they see.
Perhaps address the concerns instead of badmouthing those who have them?
also I don't see how the link you posted shows that blocks are not full.
also, what if most people who read the white paper don't want higher fees, they wanted more volume of fees, based on the idea that technology gets better over time? 
@_date: 2016-03-21 00:38:57

The old aqueducts approach. No one is trying to dismiss what the Core devs have done.
That being said, why are so many people upset?
When the temporary data cap was added it was so much larger than the data usage that it was never intended to be constantly hit. The chief developer of btc at that time, Satoshi, said it could be raised if hit. That it wasn't fixed right away was not a problem as we all agreed on a vision of raising the limit when hit.
I think that is the crux of the disagreement.
@_date: 2016-03-27 20:55:47
whoa there buddy, I don't think you have a right to tell people their things aren't real because you don't like them.
It can hold btc, it's a wallet. It's a particular type of wallet but it is one. You hurt your image and confuse newbie with such opinionated wording.
Pretend that other people want to do things you don't approve of, but image they have good reasons for doing so. Some things might want a ecdsa key pair and *not* a hd recovery seed. 
I still don't see how a ecdsa key pair isn't 'secure' inherently

@_date: 2016-03-27 23:40:31
I would think he means that instead of doing a small change to the data cap they are doing a more complicated change to the code, in effect making it do many steps for a simple action.
For it to be legacy though there needs to be something better that is in use, not just loss of potential.

It will happen in only a few years.
The question is, will it be a decentralized free to anyone coin or will be be some Gov coin, given out on subsidy or discount and promoted with huge amounts of fiat until it is more popular than the broken or non-fully-working stateless cryptos

Well, if the hack is discovered quickly and it can be fixed quickly then an emergency hard fork can change the software to fix the vulnerability. If that's the case it may not fail it nothing better is not right there at the time.
If there was a huge flaw it would probably die within a week, but people would still try to revive it

When the temporary data cap was added it was so much larger than the data usage that it was never intended to be constantly hit. The chief developer of btc at that time, Satoshi, said it could be raised if hit. That it wasn't fixed right away was not a problem as we all agreed on a vision of raising the limit when hit.
 I think that is the crux of the disagreement.

well when you don't have an ID or otherwise can't get a bank account, say there are no banks in your town in Africa, then it is a lot harder to save money, as you run the risks of storing and maintaining it. Also you can't spend money at places that only accept bank money or are far away.
So, because you can get btc on your cell phone and use it where there are no banks, it helps unbanked use electronic money.

Again, this is a poor view as forks are a needed part of open source projects liek Bitcoin was intended to be.

Good morning. Blockchain technology is about to face a test in the $2.6 trillion-dollar “repo” market, where securities traders undertake ​short-term loans. Meanwhile, it is appearing in much smaller markets, too.
Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp., said Tuesday that it will begin testing an application of blockchain, “the digital ledger originally used to track ownership and payments of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, to help smooth over problems in the crucial but increasingly illiquid corner of short-term lending markets,” the WSJ’s Katy Burne and Telis Demos report
Smaller applications of the technology are moving ahead in financial services, industry executives and other experts said Tuesday at a conference sponsored by DTCC. CIO Journal’s Kim Nash has the story. Fredrik Voss, vice president of blockchain innovation at Nasdaq NDAQ -0.44% said the exchange chose its foray into blockchain carefully, looking for a financial market that would be low-volume, not subject to complex regulations and able to be settled immediately by the parties involved, rather than having to pass through a clearinghouse. Nasdaq launched its blockchain-based Linq exchange, for trading of shares in private companies, in December. 
For more on blockchain, see CIO Journal’s Blockchain Explainer and industry analysis
Blockchain gains momentum. Financial institutions said Tuesday at a conference that blockchain is likely to proliferate gradually, processing transactions in small-scale systems. But before blockchain can be implemented in larger systems, developers must improve it to handle high-volume transactions reliably, said Michael Bodson, president and chief executive of Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. The DTCC, an industry-owned utility and sponsor of the event, contributed Tuesday to blockchain’s growth, announcing that it would begin testing it to help settle trades in short-term lending markets known as repurchase agreements.

The opposition to that might state that for the many early years of Bitcoin low fees were parts of the draw, the expectation that all nodes grow larger over time and many small txs may miners was used to intice many into believing in btc.

Satellite observatory 'Helios' -  naked Agrav motor
A highly classified technology, it's origins still higher classified, the Naked A-grav Motor allows unprecidented travel through space.    
Previously installed with a solar observation satellite named 'Helios' it was activated covertly and used to explore the solar system. Officially the satellite has not responded and it lost/MIA, but in truth it discovered an alien artifact in the cold reaches of space.  
This artifact is being studied by the sharpest minds available to mankind but still its secrets elude us.
The object shows indications of being connected to a 'sub-space' network of some kind, interfaced possibly through what appears to be a crystalline rock mounted in the device. The object appears to be a dataset, an interesting discovery is in the way the object stores information within itself and its 'network'.
This proof of work concept has many applications here, documentation and protocols have been created and distributed based on the discovery made by code-named: SatOsHi NakAMoto.

While there is progress toward new standards on encryption, authentication and tokenization, there are instances of multiple standards being developed to address the same weakness; it is unclear whether these evolving standards will be complementary or competing substitutes.
Although the Federal Reserve’s role for each of the supporting strategies listed below will initially be limited to that of leader/catalyst, the role could expand to that of service provider in the future, depending on the outcome of early phases of work.
Fraud data improvements in the United States will likely be limited without involvement and coordination by a trusted party.

Design options that require the building of completely new payments infrastructure (e.g., new infrastructure for (near) real-time payments, potentially leveraging technical components of legacy platforms, new network switch for linking limited participation networks).
Option 3: Build new (near) real-time payments infrastructure to address targeted use cases, leveraging legacy infrastructure for settlement
This design option calls for building a new, credit push only, clearing infrastructure that uses a single transaction message (as opposed to batch messages) for clearing instructions. Messages would be exchanged between originating and receiving financial institutions through a network operator in (near) real time. Posting to the payee’s account by the receiving bank would occur upon receipt of a payment message. Interbank settlement of transactions would occur through existing settlement mechanisms at intraday settlement windows. The payer and payee would receive (near) real-time notifications during the clearing and posting process (may be a value- added service from financial service providers).
Leverage telecom infrastructure was not pursued further, primarily due to the fact that it may be inherently limited to mobile channels and has limited connectivity into the current banking system.
A digital transfer vehicle was not considered a sufficiently mature technology at this time, but was identified for further exploration and monitoring given significant interest in the marketplace. It is noteworthy that Option 2 (leverage distributed architecture), which was selected for further exploration, has certain similarities to this option with respect to leveraging decentralized IP networks for point-to-point communications.
For example, it may be necessary for the Federal Reserve to provide a payment service to ensure that an adequate level of service is provided nationwide or to avoid undue delay in the development and implementation of the service.

20 was suggested because simulations showed the network could handle it, but then it turned out to cause too much stress and some miners said they could do 8 so he went with that.

I see blocks are largely full, with some empty blocks pushing down the average, and some blocks at 90-95% full that will never get 100% full.

WASHINGTON—One of the top U.S. banking regulators will issue a formal call this week for officials to start crafting a new framework aimed at governing the rapidly growing financial-technology sector—a nod to complaints from traditional banks and startups alike that current rules both stifle innovation and provide insufficient oversight for new forms of finance.
“What we’re talking about now is receptivity to exploring these issues and understanding these different models as opposed to saying ‘no’ right off the bat,” Amy Friend, chief counsel with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Friday.
Ms. Friend was previewing a so-called white paper on “responsible innovation” that her agency will release Thursday, the first major move made by any federal bank regulator to try to provide clear guidelines for fintech companies and products, ranging from online lending to digital currencies.
The document is unlikely to include much in the way of specific proposals. Rather, it is intended to kick off a formal discussion between regulators and the industry over how best to create new rules and processes. The OCC, an independent bureau within the Treasury Department, will ask for formal comments and could begin issuing guidance and rules based on that feedback.
Though many regulators are dabbling with studies and conferences aimed at understanding the new financial products emerging from the largely unregulated fintech sector, the OCC’s white paper will be the first attempt at establishing a new regulatory framework. The OCC oversees the national bank chartering system, so many industry players believe the agency is better positioned than other banking regulators—the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.—to bring fintech firms into the banking space under one federal regulatory regime.
The white paper is meant to spur a discussion on how to set up a new framework within the OCC so companies can have a main point of entry to submit an innovative idea, and to establish a clear policy internally so OCC officials know how to assess that idea.
“There are so many disparate points of entry now and we don’t have a way to collect all of that information and come up with a consistent way of evaluating something that’s innovative and then rendering an opinion,” Ms. Friend said.
The white paper is designed to try to address in a systemic way mounting complaints that a 20th-century regulatory regime is failing to keep up with a 21st-century financial system.
“The fintech industry…is not stopping but many companies are scratching their heads in trying to determine whether their product is in compliance since there’s not a clear, uniform direction from the federal regulators,” said Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, a nonprofit advocate for **bitcoin** and blockchain technologies. Blockchain is a technology underpinning the **bitcoin** digital currency that is emerging as a way to let companies make and verify transactions on a permanent ledger without a central authority.
The OCC’s new focus on fintech also marks a bit of a shift in tone for regulators who since the financial crisis have paid more attention to reining in risk-taking and experimentation.
“Once the OCC thinks financial innovation is important, that’s a big change to the regulatory regime,” said Jo Ann Barefoot, a former OCC deputy comptroller and now a senior fellow at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry is scheduled to outline the plan in a speech there.
Various regulators have recently started looking into fintech, but there has been little collaboration and guidance issued so far has been limited to specific areas like faster payments and vendor oversight. Federal Reserve Banks have periodically held conferences on innovation and the payments network in recent years. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—which has increased scrutiny of fintech firms that come under its mandate to oversee nonbanks—launched a program called “Project Catalyst” that allows innovators to pitch their ideas to the agency in the hope that it won’t take immediate enforcement.
Critics say the U.S. has been slower than other countries, particularly the U.K., to craft a more fintech-oriented regulatory framework. The U.K. launched “Project Innovate” last year through the Financial Conduct Authority to help companies work with regulators on how to launch innovative financial products in the market. The FCA is currently working on a so-called sandbox model that would allow innovators to test products in the marketplace under regulatory watch.
“The U.S. regulators are watching what the U.K. has been doing over the past year and I think a lot of folks on this side of the pond feel like the U.S. regulators need to catch up,” Mr. Brito said.

So we need to start teaching people about btc, we should do classes or something?
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:56:10
Some report by CitiGroup last year talked about btc, they said the rise to digital currency was inevitable, but they can't accept for 2 reasons, they can't affect the supply, and they can't freeze ssets. 
So everything I have read since then indicated they will launch their own chittyCoin that emables the same practices banks use nowadays

I don't think this is technically true. 
When XT was release it was being discussed, then it was removed. People didn't know why it was removed so they reposted it, when it became clear terymus was censoring discussion of potential change people started reposted it more. Then the mod team decided to 'punish us' by turning off their moderation and flooding the sub with xt posts, which lasted for days.
Do I need to get links to prove this?
@_date: 2016-03-10 02:54:20
If anyone is suspect then everyone is.
How do we know that there aren't 'agent' working against us everywhere, in Core, in VC companies as CTO's or other technical or business position, as people who try to establish names for themselves to gain authority and those.
Point being it is possible some of the people working on Core, perhaps even with commit access are working against the good on the community or system. They might not even be doing it knowingly. 
How do we go on when no one can be trusted? 
Trust only code, and have it reviewed by many people and if there are no problems then try to use it (risks may need to be taken, just like the launch of btc).

I'm not sure that idea would have worked out, we see how today someone can include many txs in a block that go only to and form themselves, this inflates the block size. If someone wanted large blocks they could do this all the time, and Satoshi's idea would just keep increasing the size. If *too* big is a problem, this can cause that.
I think.

From my experiences (USA), using it to buy things online is way easier when you can scan the bar code instead of entering your info or giving money to paypal etc.
It doesn't far well for B&amp;M stores but when merchants give discounts for using it online (often just the different of the credit card fee) they can get more business and even grow a name for themselves in the small btc community.
Check out mycelium gear, bitpay, coinbase, or snapcard.IO and see if they have a pacg with all the info you want

What if the logs *were* faked ,beforehand and somehow put onto the computer either before it was analyzed or by one of the agents working on it? 
But what about all the other evidence leading to them arresting him. so maybe not.
How do you think an agent might have got a copy of the wallet? I figure either from the server, probably not; from the computer itself, maybe; or from remote hacking into DPR's computer.
What about: logs indicate he paid off hackers, what if he made up some of these and kept the money?
@_date: 2016-03-06 23:06:39
I don't think that is the case at all. As I see it the people there were censored or slighted by the moderators here so they went somewhere they would be free to have discussion on ideas banned here. But since there is no point is posting the same news twice the only extra stuff there is stuff that wouldn' be here. In that stuff are things showing that blockstream workers and funders may have interests that don't align with users.
That doesn't mean they are trying to detract from what the core devs have done, it would be silly to think that, they are instead trying to expose unknown information so that we can all be better informed to make better decisions. That doesn't mean they always draw the correct conclusions from the data they find.

I feel like this logically fails, if something has the support of everyone in the space except 10 dudes, then it becomes bitcoin. Then the other thing, like btc V 0.1.1 is an old and obsolete version, that once was btc but is no longer.

@_date: 2016-03-01 23:52:37
In this case the client/implementation Core might (likely) die for good, and another client, maybe even named core, would be the new bitcoin. Bitcoin would survive just updated to a new version, as happens with updates, the old version would die. The news might take it as btc has died in the sense it has before.
@_date: 2016-03-15 01:31:06

@_date: 2016-03-11 03:04:30
some people are just too easily butthurt. and the mods here are known to keep things so focused on the Core client that no other bitcoin client or cryptocurrency can be discussed so much that some newbies have been indoctrinated into downvoting anything that may possibly hold an opinion they don't agree with, instead of reading things or discussing things in a rational and logical manner.
Now I like imagination, and to be prepared, so I like your question but I'm not sure I can give you a good answer.
First I'd like to wonder what kind of situation could that be? A client with non-interoperaable rules such as a 1mb+ client and a 1mbOnly client, that gains the majority of the network hash power could cause one chain to die unless it moves to a new POW but that isn't a requirement, it's a decision by the losing team to keep their side alive in case they were really right and the two chains can coexist and likely specialize, one may be a high fee settlement layer and the other could be closer to a p2p electronic cash.
What else could cause this need? A new, cheap and easy, way to do SHA-256 hashes would be like the new age of ASICs but unless they were owned by bad actors why would the network split?
So let's say jsut age, SHA is old and QCs are real, the SHA-256 must be changed, a fork will be made that upgrades the sysem but that would hace a huge amount of prep and plan time (if it ever got agreed upon, it's more likely a group will split that outgrows the stagnet chain over time).
If we assume there has to be a switch and NOW, then what? We have to pick a new *secure* algorith which is hard to do under pressure and ot the happyness of many.
If you want to be prepared in this regard, then find a new POW that is secure, and find hardware that can perform it. Once the chain swithces technology may improve and bring GPU&gt;ASIC improvments.

It sounds like you don't understand the situation very well at all.
He warned us of the current congestion a year ago, and now we have it.
He proposed an idea he thought safe, and later refined it based on more data. 
They he lowered it again and again in an attempt to compromise, but core has made no such compromises.
You confuse an attempt at working together with some sort of 'flip flopping' when in reality he is reacting to other's opinions and data.

IN Satoshi's descriptions and the whitepaper, it sure seems like it can scale with a high volume of txs to enable a e-cash/e-gold distributed money system. 
The idea that everyone should be able to run a full node is not originally part of Bitcoin.

I don't think so, at least not based on any data I've seen.
I don't think of the users or early adaptors expects btc to be brushing against the data cap limit.
When the temporary data cap was added it was so much larger than the data usage that it was never intended to be constantly hit. The chief developer of btc at that time, Satoshi, said it could be raised if hit. That it wasn't fixed right away was not a problem as we all agreed on a vision of raising the limit when hit.
btc was working fine before, why hamper it?

Australian Bitcoin ‘Miner’ Withdraws IPO
Bitcoin Group’s offering would have been the first IPO in Australia of a bitcoin miner
By ROBB M. STEWART
March 9, 2016 12:22 a.m. ET
0 COMMENTS
MELBOURNE, Australia--Cryptocurrency “miner” Bitcoin Group Ltd. has pulled plans to float on the Australian securities exchange, blaming a call by the exchange to prove it will have enough capital to run its operations.
The company said Wednesday it had elected to withdraw from an initial public offering and would return money collected to investors. It planned to consider a fresh offer after a so-called block halving later in the year when the value of bitcoin is expected to move sharply, it said.
Bitcoin Group’s offering would have been the first IPO in Australia of a bitcoin miner--one of the independent computer owners who confirm and process transactions in the currency, and are compensated with freshly issued bitcoins that add to the global supply. Another bitcoin miner, now known as DigitalX Ltd., joined the ASX in early 2014 following the reverse takeover of listed Macro Energy Ltd.
The Melbourne-based company had already resubmitted its IPO prospectus twice since its was first filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in June 2015, after the regulator first rejected a financial forecast then questioned the reasonableness of its bitcoin mining model. After months of delays, the IPO closed on Jan. 25, having raised just over 5.9 million Australian dollars (US$4.4 million).
A spokesman for ASX Ltd., operator of the country’s main exchange, confirmed the company had been notified it had yet to satisfy listing requirements, namely demonstrating it had enough working capital to carry out its objectives.
In a letter to Bitcoin Group Chief Executive Sam Lee, released to the market Monday, ASX said a report supplied by the company indicated a base-case scenario whereby the company would need a further capital injection beyond September 2017.
Bitcoin Group said the independent accountant the ASX required it to hire to prepare the working capital report was required to factor in the reduction of newly minted bitcoins with the expected “block halving” this year but without taking into account an expected increase in the bitcoin price.
It said that the last time block halving occurred in November 2012, the price increased in value by more than 1,000% in the following six months. The number of bitcoins that can be generated is limited by design, and once every four years the number of bitcoins that can be mined every 10 minutes is cut in half.
“Unfortunately, ASIC prohibited any forecasting on the bitcoin price which resulted in a report which did not allow for any increase in bitcoin price upon the number of bitcoins available to be mined halving in July 2016,” it said.
The company said its intention is to push ahead with an IPO after allowing time for the price of the digital currency to reflect the reduced number of bitcoins being released, which is expected by September.

This doesn't seem factually correct, for one a very similar story situation happened a few months ago with someone posting how MS stopped accepting btc but it was found it was never something they did accept it for.
In addition it says ethereum is going to overtake bitcoin and I don't really see that happening anytime sonn, that's still like a 6 fold increase for ether.

I see core developers talk about their want for a small settlement layer, I see luke or todd say they are okay with 20, $100 fees in btc. I see actions by the dev team that doesn't reflect Satoshi's vision nor the idea put forth by him and the white paper.
I see the system being manipulated from the insdie to change it to something it was never intended to be.

Re: Flood attack 0.00000001 BC

Forgot to add the good part about micropayments. While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall.     
If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time.     
Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms.       
Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical.     
I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem [trivial.](

Blocksize does not equal block size limit. 
We've had the temporary 1mb block size limit since it was put in to stop spam and the block size itself was way less than the limit.
Saying we'll have fewer nodes if btc gets far more people is disingenuous at the least. Such a sitaution. might even cause a price rise and more people to run nodes.

You're being intellectually dishonest when you say that as I think you're plenty smart to know exactly what I meant.
But if you want me to spell it out for you:
I am talking about inaction on this one, very specific subject, the data cap. No one is trying to detract from the work of these developers on other points, but there has been ample evidence we need to address the data cap issue for years, and they have not acted and in fact seem unwilling to compromise at all on the subject.

When the temporary data cap was added it was so much larger than the data usage that it was never intended to be constantly hit. The chief developer of btc at that time, Satoshi, said it could be raised if hit. That it wasn't fixed right away was not a problem as we all agreed on a vision of raising the limit when hit.

I've seen quite the opposite, people now who won't even consent that forks are useful at all, die hard opinions on this. no hard fork ever will be considered. which doesn't make any sense to me.
this isn't about anything, you nitpicked my statement that you said didn't mesh but they do. happy for more throughoput of curse but the data cap will have to increase, every estimation says so. why not be prepared withing reason, if we don't hurt decentalization by keeping btc functioning like it used to then let's do that. Why unneccisarly hamper use when we don't have to? I see no data showing adverse effects from a 2mb data cap raise. and that *is* specifically what I am talking about, raising the cap not the throughoput.
My problems with seg wit are that it requires a lot of reqritting and would require IMO far more testing to assure it's safety than a data cap increase that could be done to keep btc functioning.
Seg wit seems great but I fear it may be pushed trhrough without adaquet testing, plus more code rewriting introducs more room for insidious actions by any bad actor, and less time for review.

it wants a slow change, I want to be prepared
In summary, hard forks are extremely powerful, and we need to use them very responsibly as a community. They have the ability to fundamentally change the technology or economics of the system, and can be used to disadvantage those who expected certain rules to be immutable. They should be restricted to uncontroversial changes, or risk eroding the expectation of low trust needed in the system in the longer term. As the block size debate has been controversial so far - for good or bad reasons - this BIP aims for gradual change and its effects start far enough in the future.

I think it's to do with the price of electricty and the effiecny of the miners, on average they are paying a certain amount for their bitcoins and for the miners who don't get them for free they have to sell almost all of them at some rate in order to afford elecricity, let alone start up costs or hardware. Last I heard that rate wasn't too far from the market rate, meaning that miners who don't have things for free have to likely sell most of their coins to stay alive.

I think most people already had that idea, many people in the past have argued that bitcoin may be an underlying platform that can be used itself but also used to build many things on, a goverment pegged currency being one possibility.

If btc gets its major win and it is a sibling currency to the world's major currencies (which may or may not be electronic currencies in part at that point) then there will likely be enough people using it to support the miners, in fact if that were the case the very low end of bitcoin would need to be expanded or microtransactions couldn't work. So either add decimal places or LN can be put to steward over microtransactions that can be pegged to satoshis.
if btc doesn't get more users then nothing works
as long as some people want to use btc it will exist, but if failure for major status is real then the amount of people will be low

Why do you not think fees will be enough to pay miners? I guess if you want less hashing power then you might want less people using bitcoin which makes sense that you wouldn't think fees would be enough.

Well you can still make tx with no fee or low fee, and you have to wait for a conformation no matter what, so you might wait longer but you are still waiting.

I've mused on this on anpother place, what if this happens more than once and there are a number of rare or collectable forks, and maybe something could happen where those copies were needed, like a weakness was found that wasn't in the old versions, or there are 100 billion people and not enough satoshis? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:33:41
I think that is a shortsighted argument, it uses the current market as the future market.
*If* bitcoin is to grow, more users are needed, which means more txs and more fees overall, with enough fees microtransaction (like envisioned by Satoshi) might finally be possible *and* miners can still get enough fees to get paid the same amount even with the decreasing block size.

while i agre with most of this I wanted to point out that the bigger blocks don't mean they will happen right away, just that if they are needed we aren't stuck without them, miners can still set their own limits and miners who waste energy building blocks that don't get propogated and built fast enough to get the coinbase may decide it is more profitable to play by the rules.
also the bitcoin foundation is overwith.

@_date: 2015-08-25 23:54:44
I think the argument is that over time as blocks grow, if technology doesn't grow at an equal or greater pace then only those with unmetered internet connections or high grade specialized computers would be able to act as nodes. As such, the poorer people get pushed out and the rich become richer because it is harder to newcomers to join. Then there might be a number of specialized datacenters that were the network. 
This is one type of centralization which favors the rich and not the poor. But let's not forget that we don't want the ability for collusion that could lead to tampering with the blockchain. Like how a bank can freeze or take your money because they own the books and they can change them.

Specifically, they may have to mitigate risks related to reputation, security and compliance as they utilize systems over which they are not in direct control.
Alternatively, banks could simply stick with their current processes, while decentralized systems grow in their own right as more people use them for P2P transfers and international payments. In this scenario, customers could end up with a choice of two parallel ecosystems and trust in traditional payment intermediaries could fall if newer alternatives prove more accurate and efficient.

However no matter this be btc or a different crypto, these currencies will begin to reach into every part of the globe. Btc is unlikely to remain a niche community, it will either grow or die as something else takes over, but as I see it, there can be no middle ground.

I don't think they are trying to appeal to you or I. I might guess they are trying to start a privatly run blockchain between banks. But if they can actually pull it off remains to be seen
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:34:51
The point is that they *shouldn't* care. 
edit: to be more clear, they shouldn't care because it doesn't matter, and it doesn't matter because many smart people have looked over the code and even changed it with others looking over their changes to the point where no evil changes are likely to be present and most of the original code is gone anyways.

@_date: 2015-08-18 00:43:22
Well forking is the nature of bitcoin, it needs it to evolve. 
Which is what makes your point so interesting, what is some small but still sizable portion of each blockchain that ever gets split continues. There might be some collectable market for bitcoin V13.3 or whatever. We can imagine many possibilities for these coins. If Bitcoin MAIN suffers inflation to the point where one satoshi is too much for things then maybe another secure but estranged version of btc would emerge, but then again what about alt chain and coins?

I've begun teaching others to call them secret keys and public keys so they can be noted SKs and PKs.
 I don't think most or even many users use core, instead most use SPV nodes or device wallets. But that already shows the compartmentalization of the parts. wallets *are* being split, with pool mining at least in some way mining is being pulled away. cold storage hardware for SKs are another example.
I think this is already happening.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:06:40
Why did you make this post? The core dev team hasn't done anything so someone else did something, but all that already happened. What is the point of this post, what do you intend to accomplish with it and how?
@_date: 2015-07-30 02:55:13
Well, what if birth, death, land right, or property deeds were recorded on the blockchain? In that situation a program could monitor the blockchain and when, say, you die then your car or whatever could have the ownership transfered to your kids. One of many possibilities in a far away and distant maybe land

It all seems pretty clear...
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:04:57
Citi bank says, "We believe that the adoption of digital money is inevitable." But they also mention they think a government issued currency would be better than current cash.
 
it says "ability to automatically embed automated tax collection at the tx level"
I think this could be possible by having an atomic unit that is only available to the authorized users and the public can only use half of the available decimals.
It seems clear they will at least try this somewhere with a government issued digency (digital currency)
they mention that they don't believe the market can handle reaching the unbanked and such on it's own.
they also state that without intervention of bitcoin it can't do what they want, which is for the banks and government to be at the center of this new technological shift.
"The eisting cannot be controlled unless a better sa$er alternative emerges unless governments and bans are at the centre o$ this technological shi$t beyond paper and credit cards it %ill continue to support $inancial crime." sorry for shitty formatting.

We keep hearing about these reputation systems, I think reporters selling their stories thought open bazar or something similar would be a great idea.    
The reporters can sell stories cheap but sell many of them and in turn they can get some reputation elevation, or is this bad for the system?
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:49:49
So what I hear is that they don't like the fact that they can't control and regulate it so they want 'competing' systems to come up with those regulations. This will only fulfill the often quoted idea that bitcoin could become a stateless (ha) currency along side other government sponsored (crypto?) digital currency

So hey, all I am saying is *if* they *were* somehow compromised, and infiltrated; then this message serves two great purposes. One in that a new pgp key has been issued which allows for continued postings to be believed if for whatever reason the original people were afk premaritally. and two that they can now get a number of people online to interact with the site and then gain some knowlege on them possibly. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 13:38:15
I might imagine you can have some sort of reputation that would allow you access to tiers with higher limits, like approval for credit cards. You start with a $1 pre approved limit and can add your own funds to back it up, then after so many good tx they allow you to use some of their money

I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of this entire situation. You are looking at it from the wrong direction.

That's what they've been saying about the block size cap for years.
@_date: 2015-07-18 18:01:57
There should actually usually be at least two outputs. The change output, and whoever you are sending to.
Say you have 1.0 btc and want to give me 0.7, you have to spend the whole 1.0 in the tx which mean you get 0.3 as change, hence the two addresses. Unless you are spending exactly as much as any particular wallet had which is becoming less common with HD wallets.
That said you can give btc to me, paul, jimmy, and carl. Or whoever, so you can have an arbitrary number of outputs as well.

@_date: 2015-07-13 00:17:48
That's not how it works, the fee is based on the size of the data, and since all the bits come together in the one tx they only have to pay one fee one time

This idea sounds very controversial to me (destroying locked, hidden, or saved btc). SHA-1 hasn't been recommended for years but has it be reliably broken? I haven't heard so, yet we have SHA-3 family function out. So shouldn't ECDAS be phased out when the threat is real, but maybe not as real as your example (else we could still be using SHA-1 with that logic, had we had it)?    
Also, shouldn't we allow ecdsa txs to be used until we know for sure ecdsa is broken?

@_date: 2016-02-20 18:13:20


this isnt' clear at all. if there are more nodes in this future than there are today, then it is more decentralized than it is today. 
so that point is false.


this is conjecture to start and false in the case of this post where many nodes run around the world in many juristictions by many people would allow one or two nodes to do any damage.
so that point is false and unrelated to the argment


All your arguments apply to a different situation than is being discussed here and are all incorrect, that is why I didn't follow then logically as they were not logically made and have no place here.
So please let us discuss the topic of diuscussion and not change the subject.
If there were many nodes, (more than today), run in many places (more than today); why would be so wrong with those nodes being hosted by people who could afford to do so. Already today this is the case.

Explain yourself please. I see bigger nodes run by more people in more places, they are just more expenseive and only rich people or companies what want to be sure of the fact can or would run them.

How does that translate into people not wanting bigger blocks at all ever? People don't like bigger fees or apparent hurdles to adoption (see greater usability), yes, but how does that mean they don't want btc to grow? 
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:50:33
You undersoot what said, but I didn't so, explain how you understood it.
I am discussing a specific situation, where there are more nodes than there are today, they are in more places and run by more people, but some of thsoe people are companies. 
This implies less censorship, so any argument that there is more censorship makes no sence.
You seem to be incorporating your own goals into this theoretical future.
His point makes no sense, a bigger bitcoin in the same set up as today is no closer to visa than it is today. btc has attributes differnt than visa, and visa is not btc. 
How can there be more censorhip with more nodes? How does btc with more nodes mean it is more like visa? You not him make any sense, it's like you're not even reading what you are replying to

@_date: 2016-02-07 18:12:44
Well with visa someone can still freeze your funds.


Now at first it seems like if he was okay with node+miners being large, but there at the end he makes a point the to opposite of my post.  These 'the rest' are maybe what we call nodes but also maybe some future SPV node we ahven';t developed yet.
VR is getting popular and so memory and internet speeds will have to keep up, so at least in the short term they won't slow too much, the 'large scale' configuration is what I am wondering about.
I know people who can't run nodes right now because they don't have fast enough internet, because american ISPs are crap; but they otherwise could easily, so that is in theory a solvable problem for now right? So if faster and bigger internet and memory exists in teh future when bitcoin is big enough that big companies would want to run nodes; if there were still thousands of worldwide nodes why would it be so bad if they were run by companies mostly?
@_date: 2016-02-20 17:44:26

Very interesting I did not know this. It doesn't directly answer my question, and the premise of what I asked may indicate more nodes in the future than there are today.

Then perhaps you can explain it to me please. As i see it NicolasDorier compared a bitcoin protocol with bigger nodes to visa, but there are obvious differences such as censorship that a bigger bitcoin has, that visa does not. Therefore his statement about getting the point makes no logical sense because his point seems to be a larger bitcoin is just like visa when it being not is the point of the comment he replied to.

Stop spreading this disinformation. I have never seen anyone claim all tx should be free, no one, ever.
In the whitepaper, which is the basis for the belief in btc that most of us have, SN says that free txs should always be available though they may take longer. I think you should reread the whitepaper and think for yourself. stop believing lies

Okay we can have fun with this, also I think they in might like or have fun with it too.
I read someone did a 'fractal' analysis that showed a rise to 40k then a drop to 4k which was interesting.
For likely situations that I might predict would be the continued stability or slow rise until next year then a burst around the halving,  but if there is a repeat of the last bubble expect media frenxy incoming

As with all changes it is good to think about how this could be used to stymy changes that a minority disagreed with but the majority approved of.
But we should always be on the look out for things of that nature.
Bitcoin can grow into something nice and professional with changes like this.
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:58:06
Well I would think that if other miners didn't have the tx then when the first miner finds a block they also have to transmit any unshared txs at the same time, which delays validation and can lose them money. I don't see the ROI on such a sitation unless number of fees overcomes block reward

No, that's jsut a fork. Aggressive would be if they didn't have consensus. Just because you don't agree with their level of consensus doesn't mean they don't have it. 
If 75% of the miners support it then there is majority consensus and it iwll take place. 
If they aimed for 90% then that would be the consensus, 
point being it isn't agressive except to the small minority that disagrees.  iF we need everyone to agree nothing will ever change

I am only using his words as a starting point (though his words are what brought many people here because they wanted those same ideas).
But yes, that individuals cannot verify their tx is valid is a good reason, and maybe the first actual answer to my question here yet; however this brings up the point that I can't run a node in a big city in the USA due to ISPs right now, so what if that doesn't change?

Well a bigger block limit (not size) is seen as a solution to many who see the blocks getting fuller for years and now almost to their currecny limit, you can't blame people for seeing blocks filling up and thinking bigger blocks would help them.
The problem is that a solution isn't forthcoming, and disagreements on what the future of btc should be influence current development. (peter todd said many times he wants smaller block limit; to these people things like this make him seem like an enemy of progress)

To be clear, they are new yes. 
But I see no evidence of being fake, and I see about half (500) the the classic nodes( 1000) appear to have have switched from the core nodes.
Is there any technical way to prove these nodes are fake? I know many have asked this question before but I have never found a realistic answer.
I am also interested to hear why you think there would be almost 4 times more full nodes that don't talk back,  4:1 is a high ratio

Of course if there are over 50% of the mienrs that refuse to mine your tx then that is censorship but that is 1) totally possible today, 2) not at all what I am talking about anywhere here, and 3) doesn't make any sense as a reply to what I said

Why would larger blocks be worse? What's the point of having your tx included in the next block for a higher fee if you can't even use bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:22:43
Okay, well.  At the same time, your stamtne implies you don't want btc to grow any bigger than it is today. but In the white paper it is talked about as a bigger system. 
So them no one who wants btc to grow and fulfill its whitepaper wants the limit to stay at 1mb would be a better staement I think.
@_date: 2016-02-17 02:34:43
I disagree, with more transactions in a future with better internet and storage there doesn't need to be high fees. Too high and people won't use.
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:43:01
I agree with all of this, great post.
However this is in no way an argument not to raise the data cap, to a safe, but usable for the time being level.
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:59:06
Are you replying to this post? These are still individual nodes and users, in many parts of the world. What you are suggesting could then be done easier today (less nodes) than in this future with more nodes with a greater reason not to let someone tell them what to do

@_date: 2016-02-07 19:58:50
that can't freeze your txs, that can't censor who you interact with where when or what?

I have a small problem with the 'why seg wit first' where you offer your opinion and no facts or data; it's just conjecture and means nothing as it has no logical foundation, even the analogy is silly as you would have more room to organize things in a bigger house.
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:40:08
I don't think OP speaks for the network, as he has no authority to dictate what is 'spam'.

@_date: 2016-02-18 02:08:11
The goals are outlines in the whitepaper, P2P electronic money.
As for the future    
?    
Major indications that digital money will become extremely widespread. But most of those players are looking out for themselves, so there are likely to be a multitude of electronic money types in the next few years, but they can't all survive. 
Some with lots of power, like a state or corporate will stay alive. These schemes probably require a user ID and have restrictions, so some sort of black market tx ability will be around, that may be btc, or some other coin if btc cannot grow the right way. It could be like an electronic gold.
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:57:31
ok, in this case what are we talking about. miners working for their own interested is what was decribed in the whitepaper, if every miner is selfish it keeps the system working. Though things have changed since this started isn't that still the idea? You'll get farther playing by the rules than trying to cheat.
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:01:17
You obviously don't know how to effectively talk to people.

merchant adoption was not ready when it was pushed heavily, many stores have bought in to the hype, got nothing and are now jaded, merchant accepting btc online do far better than brick and mortor stores obviously. 
But is it falling? I think bitpay or coinbase could tell us (not that they would if it were falling) but the impression I get is that more websites are accepting btc over time, while some physical stores did and stopped.

I understand address reuse for tracking, that is the point the bloom filters are trying to mask, no? Also the benefit of HD wallets to some extent. 
So all one needs to do is have a dymanic IP to avoid all this?
To that last comment, there is no more reason for anyone in the future to censor things than there is today. They can just disable tor today if that is the case. These theoretical companies and wealthy node operators of the future don't want ot see btc fail either, why would they take action against it? And if theyt are distributed they cannot be correced (anymore so than today)

this lie is a hilarious joke. First you banned discussion of other clients (that would become bitcoin is successful) for not being bitcoin.

Changing the POW algorithm from btcs SHA(SHA()) to maybe SHA SHA + 1 or something could be used to create a pretty exact copy of bitcoin that the current miners couldn't mine (do to problem change), if the banks restricted use of this to just themselves it would be a centralized blockchain.
The other options I can think of would be a TTP or a centralized database with some sort of merkle tree thing kind of like btc

Then the question is: What can be done to fix this?
How long is the lease on your office? sublet and move.    
What other services do you offer? How can people find out about these? Do they have a free then paid tiers?     
Do you focus on B2B stuff, trying to get your local community involved in some ecosystem where businesses could trade with factories or farmers directly, giving the btc back and forth as they trade, and the workers getting some btc as well so that they can spend it on the items produced. Research then outreach. Make a community if you can.

I am indeed not pulling your leg, this is out of my normal bounds but I am still interested in it.
It is surely an interesting idea as well. I agree that the data will be of value presuming it would take a long time for someone else to build it themselves. I also agree that as cryptos become more common the study of how to break them will increase as well.
I am curious how you plan to undo the ecdsa, or the public addresses where you have keys, other than brute forcing. Perhaps keep running your own creations into a program as training?
Also I am familiar with the secret key to pub key and address, but what is a private key?
@_date: 2015-09-21 00:03:07

I like the idea of a range of possible movement but I don't know what it could be based on that couldn't be manipulated.

This is the first statement I see by you, I don't knwo what else you are talking about
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:21:00
I was thinking they would get paid in btc for the selling of digital goods but maybe there is some reward for high use?
@_date: 2015-09-23 01:10:39
What if they are waiting for Open Bazzar to be released so they can include that? 
Also. There could be an internet (Tor?) and it could just have options related to bitcoin or buying and selling things online, with all of the 'confusing' parts taking place under the hood

@_date: 2015-09-23 01:07:39
Well then I see no reason you shouldnt make that device and market it yourself. Load it with half the btc, sell it at half the price, and call it 10.5 or something

Did you read the IBM article where they said Blockchain sans the many times
"IBM is zeroing in on a technology called blockchain, which serves as bitcoin’s online ledger. Blockchain allows the bitcoin network to track the currency’s movement from one online wallet to another. But it could be used to log other types of transactions.
“Blockchain, as a technology, is extremely interesting and intriguing,” said Arvind Krishna, senior vice president of IBM Research."

The trusted way to buy btc is bitfinex
@_date: 2015-09-25 13:48:45
I just have no idea what some of these words mean. I know what leverage is with a level... I think shorting is when you borrow bitcoin (from whom?) and sell it, then you expect the price to drop so you can buy the btc back and take a profit?
That is the only fancy market words I know.
@_date: 2015-09-18 23:52:53
Satoshi said, "I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using electronic currency in some way" and I agree, from some of the things some banks have said it sounds clear they want a digital currency they can control and btc isn't it.
@_date: 2015-09-14 13:41:44
I think this is a great idea.
Not only that, but if we can demonstrate a working small self sustained economy then others might adopt. In fact this is an idea related to John Nash's 'ideal money' a non-governmental money of some sort.
@_date: 2015-09-18 00:33:22
Yeah but did you read the rest of the article? None of the quotations from IBM sound like they will be using bitcoins blockchain
@_date: 2015-09-20 20:48:59
Well if you could clearly and concisely state what your agenda is here I will consider it.
@_date: 2015-09-16 01:53:24
I agree, some banks want to digitize the USD (citi bank for instance) and they want to use a blockchain of some sort, why not this or a similar way?
@_date: 2015-09-20 21:47:15
I don't think they need btc dead for their plan to suceed, maybe they want to be the more populated blockchain, but that doesn't necissarily imply no others can exist
@_date: 2015-09-28 01:43:03
In that case so am I, and you, and everyone/
@_date: 2015-09-20 21:01:10

Isn't bitcoin a digital currency and not a virtual currency? I think the headline is wrong
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:37:26
Here is my counter argument, they want some of their own information to be safe. So they tell their own people to use this?
@_date: 2015-09-26 21:38:06
We just saw this same article like a day ago, I think any mass publication of a digital currency is good and if it is harder to use or more restrictve than btc people might turn to btc (or whatever coin is the best)
@_date: 2015-04-13 23:27:25

I think it is very probable they are already working on some sort of governement backed digital currency. Some people want to track all your purchases, some want to do away with cash for that reason, Citi bank thinks digital currency is inevitable but they don't like btc so they have to be making their own. 
At the same time they can't just get rid of fiat, some people only take cash, cash is burried underground in places, you have to phase it out or sometrhing

There is a minimum tx fee, more txs = more fees
increasing the block size makes miners able to fit more txs into a block, since few miners accept many free txs they will get paid more per block with larger blocks as there will be more net fees.
The miner rewards from fees are small right now, with more people making txs there will be enough fees to maintain the security of bitcoin.

IMO you've already lost them
Do you care you explain why you want few people to use Bitcoin? When I read the whitepaper I thought that if lots of people used the system them everyone could use small fees, bitcoin would be secure, miners still get paid, everyone can make txs, you can even make free txs that may or may not get validated. These are the things I took away from the whitepaper.
So I am confused how you got to your opinion, as it seem to contradict what I read in the whitepaper.
Anyway, we don't know how it would work because we don't have 2-way pegged sidechains that work. But in theory there could be any number of sidechains. So it should be possible for a sidechain (which is sounding more like the lightning network at this point) to interact directly with the mainchain, which as an extension that can't be interfered with can be argued to be a part of the mainchain.  So this is not a 3rd party but simply more logic/code.

The math problems are just to prove work was done, to make it fair and secure. They are really doing something called 'hashing' which is a computer science term. There is a target difficultly, and when the result of their hashing is less than the target it is accepted by the protocol as valid. They are rewarded bitcoins for doing this. This problem is easy for everyone else to verify as correct, but hard to initially find.

Okay, so let's say BS wants to make images smaller and more readable, so they invent this. Their end goal is of course to steal the United States Declaration of Independence. But how?
No one realizes it yet, but this algorithm was designed especially by BS so that when you hash the data, it can be recovered with the right techniques. Now, assuming they have cracked the hash, they wait for images of classified US documents to be uploaded to the blockchain as proof of existence, then they secretly analyze those images. Eventually they will get clues as to where the *real* DoI is (not that impostor's fake on display in the Rotunda in DC) and be able to steal it. 
But why do they want it.?

@_date: 2015-11-08 19:31:51
I disagree with this.
Bitcoin exists for a reason right now, unless a catastrophic weakness was found people aren't going to abandon cryptocurrency. 
It bitcoin dies it is because something better came around. Bitcoin can simply go bad and the worse option can get better, or something truely better can overtake it. Or I guess corporate world can push their fedcoin so hard bitcoin loses the network effect but that probably woulnd't kill it.
So in summary I think your statement is wrong and lacks support.

I think you wanted a comma or something in there after offering
You talk of experts who want things other than the blockchain but you make it sound like it is because they have better ideas, from what I have read they don't want bitcoin because they don't like it, they can't control rate of production, and they can't reverse txs because they can't control it. 
I think a good non-state crypo will always exist, be bitcoin or not, because there will alwayhs be some demand from it, and education grows that demand at this point in time; I also think it will probably be alongside gov/corp controlled coins.
What about all the buzz of many banks working with Etherum? 
Weren't there some unsolved issues with the Bitcoin-NG?
I still think that banks were always going to adpat to cryptos but there will be a new digital gold with them, and that when people learn that banks can freeze your money but bitcoin can't, they will want bitcoin

Not really at all related, but I would like to have different pin codes. Like a different one for starting versus sending. 
Even better would be a duress wallet option where I could put in a different code at start up and have a special wallet open (maybe even this having it's own pin code needed to send, but that is getting to be a lot of pin codes). Still. I want at least the 3.

I don't think private cryptos (like btc, but unlike any potential GovCoin) wi;l ever dominate the world. Countries and such will always want control. But a non-country currency like digital gold could be complementary to all the world's digital curr.s.

So make it hard to active, in some extra special super setting menu with two confirmation boxes explaining the dangers.
Or, I've got a better idea. You have a master pin, like a phone number 7-10 numbers, and depending on how many numbers you enter you get different things. 
Like you only need 4 or 5 to sign in and send, but if you use all of them it opens a master account setting where you can change accounts that woulnd't otherwise be able to access.    
And if you enter 3 it will open a dummy wallet with some very small balance

But really, I'm sure if/when the cen banks &amp;/or govs make their own crypto it will be heavily encrypted.
If they can do something in the future why could they not do something now? What do they need to do, find the physical line between the banks or fly a small drone/plane/ satellite to intercept and override the signal?
If these things are possible in the future they are surely possible now right?
And if they are so possible then it is just we never heard about it, so why should they tell us about it in the future? If they have a blockchain they will likely only let you look at your own account and not everyone elses; make everyone an SPV node to them but ony give them select txs.    
In this way they don't ever have to reveal any thefts they don't want to that aren't customer related.

- Signs are great. 'Discounts with btc purchase' Window signs, bright and colorful signs on the checkout counter, tent/triangle signs out front facing the street.
- Pamphlets at local bitcoin meetups, or-
- the local tourism council ( as a place that accepts btc which is still a novelty but visiting people from out of the country might have an easier time with it than cross boarder currency transfer)
- get an ABTCM machine so interested people can buy coins, get one of those brochure display things and put some easy to digest info on them, their potential uses, and securing and using them .
- You can probably get one of those TVs in a  display podium and have burn a DVD with some short and easy videos, then hook that up to an old playstation/x/box/comuter and the customer and click on one of the videos and learn something
- stickers saying /btc accepted here would be good if you don't have them, but including it in ads might help too. "Jim's now accepts bitcoin" on the tv or radio or an ad on the bus
- have you considered contacting your local newspaper or news tv stations, maybe call just one first and offer them an exclusive interview/story, with one of the first local store owners to accept bitcoin. They might just go for this.
- we mentioned customer discount but it's a big one ( say you use someone and get a 0.5% transaction fee, but credit cards are 2%, you can give the customer a 0.5% discount and still save vs card). 
- maybe a map of other local business that accept btc, you guys could form a club

Under the current situation yes, but it there anything explicitly outlawing crowdfunding for shares?
E.g. They want to make super troopers 2, but they crowdfunded it. If they had made it so I got a percentage of money back (based no how much I vs others donated and related to how much money the movie made), I would have given them money in a heartbeat. But instead they wanted money to make the film so they could take home he profits.

A problem if you work until midnight (or poll closing time), we could still do voting booths, ID verification before hand and when you are in the booth you vote and something similar to a signature is broadcast; but maybe this is like a multisig signature with the govenments key as well, so no one can ever decrypt their signature to show who they voted for (by not being able to show who is who) and the votes are still verifiable and secure.
This requires the trust of a government but if that is what we are electing a part of we are already there.
edit: what if the gov's ID was a blcokchain tech of its own whereby every vote it validates is logged and the next key (nuance?) based on the previous votes combine, thus a full vote count can be made with no votes exculded

You might be interested to know that he release a 'pre-release' of the whitepaper that did not have the word bitcoin in it.
Title: Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party
Abstract: A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow
online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without the
burdens of going through a financial institution.  Digital signatures
offer part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted
party is still required to prevent double-spending.  We propose a solution
to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.  The network
timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without
redoing the proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as proof of
the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest
pool of CPU power.  As long as honest nodes control the most CPU power on
the network, they can generate the longest chain and outpace any
attackers.  The network itself requires minimal structure.  Messages are
broadcasted on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the
network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of
what happened while they were gone.

Is the idea of a subspace really so absurd? We are throughout history finding out that what we thought was the truth was not or only a glimpse. I propose a space-internet known as subspace, as seen in the documentary Indian Jones 4.
The idea being that while our current physics model says nothing can go faster than the speed of light it does not preclude things from existing above the speed of light. These superluminal particles (or whatever they are, they might not have mass), would simply exist at faster than the speed of light always, they may be able to modulate their speed but it could never dip below c. Now would these be tachyons? Are they in the same time that we are? Could they be related to dark matter, or as I once heard 'star so bright you can't see'.

well, after rereading parts of the sidechain paper I think that yes, that point is not strictly addressed but here I think is why:
If btc becomes popular enough that other sidechains are gaining more value, they must have a very strong network effect or backing, however the mere fact of them being sidechains means that they are tied to the scarcity of btc and there remains the potential for even better sidechains in the future which would also be sidechains.  The thing here is that it is all tied to btc, so btc would have to be worth a lot, and that means people would keep trying to get it. As you said, people want to make money.
