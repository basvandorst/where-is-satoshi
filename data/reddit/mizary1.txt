Think about this...  if the USD dollar becomes worthless then 1 bitcoin will be worth infinity USD. Also 1 BTC will still be worth 1 BTC.
Really what difference does it make if my 1 BTC is worth $100k but a loaf of bread costs $1k.

I was in this exact same situation 3 years ago. (about to buy a home, large % of savings in BTC)  The percentages are a personal thing.  But if you have concerns about 10-15% of your savings being in BTC. Lower the amount.  Sell some. You can always buy more later.
I had a bigger % of my savings in BTC and sold off about 80% of my BTC. Yeah we all know the price skyrocketed after that. Regrets?  Sure but I didn't have a time machine back then. Did I do the right thing? Absolutely yes.
As always the rule is, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

BTC isn't savings.  It's an investment. If you feel like you need $100k in savings and you currently have $100k total in BTC and savings. (15k BTC, 85k cash) . Then stop buying more bitcoin until you have $100k in cash. Then the amount of BTC you have doesn't matter.  But now if 100% of your investments are in BTC then that's a different problem.  Also if you need $100k in savings and plan on buying a $400k house... That's an $80k down payment, so really you need $180k in cash ($100k savings, $80k down payment) before you should jump.  You are talking about risk management here which is very personal. If you have wealthy parents and an in demand job you probably don't need 6-12mo salary in savings. But if you are a new real estate agent and don't have a friend on the planet - then you gotta be more risk averse to keep from going broke.

You need more background. Also there are dozens are brilliant people working on the blocksize issues.  It's def. not a simple fix.  I think you need to spend some hours just reading the details about how the inner workings of bitcoin work...  then if you still think you want to focus on blocksize issues the next step would be reading proposals from other people and working with them or proposing your own solutions. 
This is probably a good place to start learning how bitcoin works.
I'd devour everything there and see if anything catches your fancy...  Like someone else said you need to narrow down what you want to do. Blockchain, mining, p2p, advocacy, security, wallet tech, education, etc...

My buddy owns a brewery in ohio and will be opening a tap room sometime this year (hopefully) I was going to push him to accept bitcoin.  I hope this ruling is overturned before his taproom opens...  but it doesn't sound hopeful. The IRS really screwed things up by ruling that bitcoin is a commodity and not a currency. Also in Ohio you can't barter for alcohol...  and you can't give it away. How is a giftcard not barter? It's not currency. It's not cash. And bars can give them away. Seems like a poorly ran system. Which isn't surprising. My buddy has shared many stories of the insanity that is the Ohio Liquor control board. The city he is in hasn't been very helpful either.

I think the IRS ruling was good for bitcoin. Why could it be bad? Because we have to pay taxes on gains? You have to pay taxes on pretty much any money you make even if it's not defined. The IRS is saying, hey bitcoin is real and getting bigger. That's good news in my book. Notice they didn't mention any altcoins.

I think this move is fine...  coinbase is more of a bank than anything else. That's their model. If you don't want to deal with regulations and laws you can use localbitcoins or buy from an exchange (which have their own rules too) Right now coinbase seems to be the biggest EASIEST safest? most convenient way to buy/store/use bitcoin. This is what bitcoin needs for wide acceptance. My mom is never going to print bip38 paper wallets. 
Sure I could keep all my fiat savings in cash buried in the yard... but instead I let the bank handle all that - and in exchange I put up with the feds regulations and the banks rules.

The # of decks isn't all that important (less is generally better)...  It depends more on how many cards get dealt. It's better to play a 8d shoe where 7.25d are dealt out than a 2d shoe where only 1d are dealt out. It's called penetration.  Also they tend to put more rules on 2d games that make it more difficult to count. Like no mid-shoe entry.

Yep. Someone was crying to me recently about how his dad passed on the opportunity to get into Apple in the 1980s but he didn't do it.

You have to make decisions based on today's knowledge and your current risk allowance. For that guy  back in the 1980s he wasn't willing to take that amount of risk (he had to invest like $20k) on an unproved company. He made the right move at the time.

It's more like buying gold or speculating on currencies. Some people do make money mining. It's just not a good move for a newbie looking to dip their toes in the bitcoin pool.

3. Some type of intentional market manipulation

At first glance it seems the first scenario is the most logical...  but they did an animation too. Someone got paid to do that. It's actually not that bad.

To give you a better answer... Nobody knows. When people sell the price drops, when people buy the price goes up. When new blocks are mined the price goes down. When people horde the price goes up. It's supply and demand at it's purest. The supply is constantly rising - so there has to be continued demand for the price to stay stable or go up. If everyone sells the price will go to $0.00. If everyone on earth decided to buy the price would skyrocket (to the moon!)

Never go all in.  With anything.  Nothing is worse than playing blackjack and putting your last $100 on one hand and getting an 11 and not being able to double down - then getting a 10 to make 21. Yeah you won, but you lost potential gains.  If you bet $50 then got to double down - yeah you still only win $100... but your risk is cut in half. Going all in limits your ability to maneuver AND raises your risk exponentially.

ApplePay is good for bitcoin for one reason...  It gets regular people (and merchants) to start thinking about different ways to pay for stuff. Another good thing about applePay is Apple is going to tack on even more fees than normal CCs. Apple will get people to embrace alt payment methods. Then merchants will get tired of the extra fees and start accepting bitcoin... They will have $$$ motivation too, so they will offer promotions and discounts to incentivise people to switch to bitcoin.

Any recommendations for peppers with heat levels between jalapeno and habanero? Other than cayenne...

This is brilliant. I'd also like to see journalists, bloggers and other content creators embrace tipping. How nice would it be to read a great article or work a free tutorial and at the end click a link and tip them $1. Right now the level of new content being developed is slipping. People are not buying newspapers or magazines... Most of this new content is ad supported which brings in pennies not dollars which is why there is so much horrible content and link bait articles out there. All these creators worry about is page views. I hope Contributor allows the users to shape where their monthly $ is going and isn't just based on page views.

It's the house edge I don't like. Insurance companies have the edge. Casinos pay out a larger % of what is put in than insurance companies. Then again insurance companies are trying to put odds on WAY MORE COMPLEX gambles. Insurance isn't bad - it does serve a purpose unlike casinos. I guess I just like to gamble and insurance seems to have a large house edge which makes me super cautious.

unrelated to your question...   but my advice on roulette is STOP NOW.  You have all the early signs of a problem gambler. Chasing a loss. Expecting to win. First off you have no way of knowing if the site is legit. Yes you have won and was able to withdraw your money. But you have no way of knowing if the numbers are really random. Even if they are a double zero wheel has HORRIBLE odds. Even a single zero wheel is really bad. If you keep playing you won't need to worry about a wallet, because you won't have any money left.
That being said, I'm not against gambling. I have even played roulette IRL a few times. But you need to remember it's just entertainment. The house edge on a double zero wheel is over 5%. So for every $1 you play over time you will lose $0.05.  So if you bet $10 1,000 times odds are you will lose about $500... of course you may win or lose much faster, this is just the "average"
Also read about the [martingale system]( it seems most budding roulette players come up with this system on their own and think they can't lose. They can. And will.
Also set limits (for wins and losses) and don't break them.  What happens if you do end up with 100BTC?  Why not go for 1,000BTC?  Or 10,000BTC?  This is another sign of a problem gambler...  it's never enough. They play until it's all gone. 
Just be careful and have fun.

I bought a few in 2015? when it dipped below $200 for like an hour. I'm still pretty proud of that.  I think it was biggest (in BTC) buy I'd ever done too.   Too bad I sold off about 3/4th of my BTC last year when the price was $500-700.

I have no regrets.  I bought a house late last year and wanted to move my assets into something less volatile.  If BTC had dropped to $100 in September and I hadn't sold any I probably wouldn't have bought the house.  I'd really over extended myself by putting too much $ into BTC.  But did save some just in case. Glad I didn't sell it all.
I need to start re-evaluating my 401k for similar reasons. I am getting older and need to start thinking about moving some money into lower risk funds.  When I was in my 20s I'd put 20-30% into one high risk fund. heh.  I made a ton of money off energy funds in the early 00s.  Then 2008 happened.

But there is always risk involved.  Do your research.  Find examples of economies that have suffered from hyper inflation.

It would take a ton of research to really feel good about this type of investment.  It sounds like you are not already an expert in this subject.

No such thing as good/bad time to buy/sell.  What you are doing is prefect.  Keep buying small amounts over time. This is called dollar cost averaging.  This prevents you from making one large buy at a peak. You buy when it's up, buy when it down and it all evens out.
Anything else is timing the market which is very difficult.

I bought 3 BTC when the price dipped below $200 in 2015. That was the most BTC (not $) I'd ever bought at one time.  Still feel sorta proud/lucky for buying almost exactly at the bottom.  Too bad I sold most when prices hit $700-800 in 2016 but I was buying a house and didn't want all that $ in something so volatile. But on the upside I got a mortgage rate of 2.75% @ 15 years.  Which was pretty much the exact bottom of interest rates. That was only 19 months ago and now rates are 4.5% for a 15yr at the same lender. Huge difference.

Volume has nothing to do with the price. it's simply how much is bought/sold/moved.  Like you said if there are equal amount of buys/sells at the same price the price won't move.  Now granted often when a security rapidly moves up or down the volume will spike because investors will see the movement and want in/out.  Or it will trigger automatic trades.  But you could absolutely have high volume with no change in price.

Heck they don't even need to tie you up and cut your fingers off...  They could blackmail you.  If you have control your coins are vulnerable.  And heck it's not like bitcoin is unique here.

ok because I love analogies.  This "flex" is like someone posting that they just took out life insurance on their spouse last year and they recently died.  Premiums paid $1,450 death benefit $25,000, profit $23,550 this is the power of life insurance!   Where really that's not what it's all about at all. Most people lose money on life insurance. But even then it's not bad and serves a purpose. Life insurance is about risk mitigation.  DCA is the same. If you have $10k to invest and you do it all at once your risk is higher than if you put a little in each week.

I started at the same time as you. BUT... I bought a few when it dipped below $200 for a few hours! Only time I've timed any market so perfectly. But on the flip side I sold 75% of my BTC when prices started to rise last year...  most was sold when it was $600-800. Then a bit more when it was $1200-2000.  Crazy to think that it's $7700 now. Glad I didn't sell 100%.
I also still think I made the right move at the time. I bought a house last year. So I didn't want a big chunk of my savings tied up in something so volatile.

Gov can still regulate Bitcoin. You have to pay taxes on gains. And I'd say blockchain is the heart of Bitcoin not just a a buzzword. W/O blockchain there is no Bitcoin.

I don't understand how the federal reserve banks work but I still can use banks.
That being said bitcoin is currently more complex to use for individuals. It doesn't have to be. It could be as simple to use as a credit card. But legal uncertainties and current financial laws slow this way down.  If enough people want it... it will happen.  But right now it's mostly speculators, which worries me more than the complexity.

I could blow through $30m in less than a year.  I think most people could.  
I think for most young (20s 30s) middle class people, it would be a challenge to retire on $30m.  Two things happen. One: you get used to spending more money. Instead of flying to florida and saying in a hotel. You fly to turks and rent a house. And Two: if you are retired you will have more free time to spend money and travel.
Yes some people who get a windfall like this save and invest and live well... but I think most people are bad with money. It's why the same person who lived paycheck to paycheck when making $30k/yr still lives that way when they start making $60k/yr. I'd say most people would just keep ramping their spending until it's gone. We need more financial literacy in this country/world.

@_date: 2018-11-20 13:01:43
Because your are shorting it? Or do you think it's a chance to buy low. Would you have a limit. If it went to $0.0001 would you still be buying? Would the reason for the drop matter to you?
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:51:03
not really, because other people will sell on the bump.  The halvening isn't inside info.  It's just part of how bitcoin works.  It's already factored in.
NOW HOWEVER..  the media tends to report on halvenings so that increases exposure and gets a few more regular folks to buy some which does send the price up.  But still lots of people sell on any good/neutral news.
Basically you can't win. ha
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:39:33
You have to examine the risk vs reward of everything.
I did just buy a house and that means I have taken on more risk. Insurance helps to mitigate risk but you are correct that it doesn't cover everything.  But I wanted a house and was willing to take on the risk.
However I think the odds of bitcoin dropping below $100 is more likely than my house being blown up by terrorists.
I guess my point is there are no sure things in life.  I just see lots of people talking like bitcoin is just going to keep going up forever and there is no chance at it losing 90%+ of it's current value.  Bitcoin is still very risky compared to a mortgage or the average mutual fund. But there is also HUGE upside potential that for many people outweighs the risks. But it would be hubris to say there is no chance Bitcoin will fail.
Look at the Roman empire...  they ruled the known world for hundreds of years. I am sure they thought that was NEVER going to change. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:32:19

OR...  *puts on tinfoil hat* they are launching their own coin and want to corner the market!  ha.
Also I believe that news could have pushed the price down.  Remember when China "banned" bitcoin every few years a couple years ago.  It was pure pump and dump.   And it worked.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:53:34
The majority of bitcoin is held by big investors.  People on here mainly own a few hundred USD worth if any.  Yes, for sure there are people on here with 100+ BTC.  Some wealthy and some old time HODLers.  The people who really move the needle are the ones buying and selling large quantities.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:18:10
Why? If if fell to $0.0001 wouldn't you think it was because the world had decided it was flawed and worthless? If Apple stock fell 99.9999% there would have to be a reason right? Would you buy Apple at $0.001? 
I'm just saying don't follow things blindly. There reasons behind the ups and downs. And set limits. And continually reassess. Real investors don't get emotionally involved with investments. They are always willing to sell and move on if the conditions meet their criteria.
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:25:39
There is nothing preventing APPL from going to zero. Lots of giant companies have gone under. And look at companies like Tesla burning though cash, no profits... but stock is worth a ton.  Or look at gold, gemstones, baseball cards...  these things have no real value.  Their value is based on supply and demand, like lots of things.
Scammer?  Who is the bitcoin scammer?  It's open source. People know what it is. If you choose not to invest, no big deal... but why do you care if others do?

There are pros and cons.  Depending on what you invested in you could have less money now. Not all investments have gone up over the past 10 years. And as you get closer to retirement you should def. keep some savings in cash.
But yes keeping all your savings in a non-interest bearing account is never a good move.

push the timeline back to two years and which investors made more?
Also apples and oranges.
Also it's easy to point out good/bad investments after the fact.
Buy things you believe in...  everything goes up and down. Bitcoin is volatile and risky.  You might lose it all or get rich.  Where AAPL and AMZN is never going to go up 1000% in a year, bitcoin still could.
Everyones appetite for risk is different.
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:50:58
So if bitcoin dropped to $100 tomorrow you would buy it?
Would it matter WHY it dropped to $100?
If I saw Apple stock was selling at $1.76 a share (down 99%) I would NOT be buying w/o knowing WHY it lost 99% of it's current value. And really I can't imagine many scenarios where I'd want to invest in anything that had lost 99% of it's value.
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:53:52
Just depends on how do you measure success?    I personally don't see bitcoin as a currency.  I don't think it's ever going to be the most common method of payment on earth.

It's just the wonder of variance. As a former advantage BJ player I know all about variance. I even once wrote a coin flipper application so I could experiment with variance.
Here is a quick explanation.  What's the odds on a coin flip?  50/50.  So if I flip a coin the odds that it's heads is 50%. So if I flip a coin 100 times it SHOULD be 50 heads and 50 tails.  But that's where variance comes in. You could flip a coin 100 times and get 80 heads and only 20 tails.   That's variance.   However over time you will approach 50% heads and 50% tails. But in the short run anything can happen. You COULD flip a coin 100 times and get heads all 100 times. Of course the odds are 1 in 1.2676506e+30.  But if you flip long enough it's not a question of if but when.

bitcoin is down like 50% over the past 90 days.  That's mild?  What would be severe?  Down 95%?
I don't think it's a big deal, but it is as newsworthy as when it went up 10,000%+ last year.
Journalism is tough.  People want big headlines.  "Bitcoin down slightly for some reason" is not a good headline.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:33:14


I wasn't really trying to quantify the importance. Just saying they are both headline worthy.  If a stock with a market cap the size of bitcoin dropped 50% over 3 months it would also generate headlines.


Yes technically people want big headlines that are accurate, but advertisers just care about the clicks, they don't care if the reader goes away disappointed.
And I agree that most of these articles are stupid...  But people are mostly stupid. A better article would be about volatility but joe six pack isn't going to click on an article about volatility.

In these doomsday scenarios doomsday preppers will be laughing at the HODLers. heh.  Currency will be in chickens and bullets.   The USA and the US dollar isn't likely to totally collapse anytime soon.  If it did it would disrupt the entire planets monetary system.  I can't see everyone switching to bitcoin at that point. The internet and phones would be non functional (or barely functional) at that point.  Once again chickens and bullets FTW.
I think the collapse of the US isn't very likely. Doomsday preppers are putting all their money on a LONGSHOT.
I don't think avoiding "risky" banks is a good reason to buy/hold bitcoin.
And remember with bitcoin if you are holding the keys you are vulnerable to the classic $5 wrench attack. So you better have a fortified bunker to keep you and your BTC safe if the us dollar collapses.

If think if bitcoin had bit $5k instead of $20k and then dropped down to $2k people would be saying the same thing about $5k was unrealistic and $2k is along the "normal" trend.

I could be wrong here... and please eli5 if I am...  but 2/3rd of all BTC have been mined. Even if the remaining 1/3 were all mined at once it's only going to dilute the price 1/3.  So if the price was $36k it would become $24k.  Down 33%. The more that is mined the less influence future new BTC will have on the price.

I just did the same thing... but I didn't buy back in.  But also didn't sell all.  What really hurts is the large amount of bitcoin I sold off last year from $450-700.  But I still made the right move.  The right move doesn't always lead to profit.  And wrong moves often do. But of course in the long run right moves should triumph.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:53:40
Yeah I sold two at $1280.  My thought was I'll buy them back when the price dips again.  Nope. Just sold another at $1511 so expect the price to continue to rise.  And I do NOT have most of my bitcoins.  I sold most of them off last year from $450 to $700. But I was about to buy a house so I didn't want so much cash in such a volatile investment.

It's actually pretty similar. Yes it's true that bitcoin is locked into this model.  But gold mining follows the same pattern.  If the price of gold dropped 90% most mining would stop.  And if gold shot up to $1m an ounce mining would go crazy.  Supply and demand.

@_date: 2019-05-02 18:18:33
For the average person properly securing bitcoin is way too complicated which is why these mistakes happen. This complexity is inherent to bitcoin and is one of the biggest issues with wide adoption.
And I am not just talking about theft. People accidentally lose bitcoin all the time. ~20% of all bitcoin is lost forever. Granted much of that was in the early days when it wasn't worth much. But I frequently still see posts of people asking for help trying to get their bitcoin back after HDDs fails, password/keys are lost. Yes once again human error. But if I forget my bank password I don't lose all my money.
Also these negatives are part of the magic of bitcoin. If it had protections built in - it might not be as secure when used properly. 
If bitcoin does reach wide adoption 3rd parties must be part of it. Doesn't mean enthusiasts can't still keep coins in paper/hardware wallets.  Just like I can cash my paychecks and keep the paper currency in a safe in my home. But most people trust the banks more than themselves. Yes money can be seized, banks can fail, but you gotta trust someone.  Either yourself or some so called experts.
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:55:29
That's how almost all ATM's work.  You pay a fee for withdrawing money. Sounds like it's around 10% similar to paying $2 to take out $20 which I am sure people do everyday. But yeah not me.
Also not many people are going to buy/sell $$$$ via a bitcoin ATM. I was in chicago once and needed cash and my bank card wasn't working. I considered hitting up a bitcoin ATM just to get $50 in spending cash. I would have been fine paying a $5 fee for that.

What if it the price goes down?  What would you say to people who spent their life savings and bought at $20k?  Be patient?  Should they tell their landlord to be patient with the past due rent until the price recovers?  You may be confident but confidence will not make the price go up.

I barely understand the basics of how the US banking system works. But if the banks are not following the rules/laws then they should be held accountable. If I understood the laws and felt like they needed changes I'd call my congressmen, start a PAC, raise money, build a website, etc and try to create change. Lack of understanding is what the killer is. For banking or Bitcoin. People in general don't care about block chain or the inner workings of the banking system. People care about HODLing and the moon and saying the govt sucks. Rarely (on here) do I see any real discussion by educated people about actual issues. I am aware this was an attempt to "educate" us about the horrors of banks, but it doesn't seem to be written in a neural acedemic manner. It sounds more like propaganda.

But I could also quit my job get a trailer and live off ramen for the rest of my life. But I'd rather give up some freedom in exchange for living a "better" life.

Feel like it will win right now, but I am sure the people who invested in AOL in 1998 felt pretty confident too.  I'm always shocked how much $$ has been invested in the alt coins. Most of the crypto money isn't from reddit users.  It's from investors.  And they are hedging. In 1998 if you believed in the internet and hedged your bets you would be a rich man.

Don't we have this now?  You don't have to use USD. You can use bitcoin or dogecoin or whatever you want.
 


I think this is over simplification.  The USA has been using this system for many years and the economy is up. I am sure I can find examples of failed economies that didn't use fractional reserves. it's not that simple.


Can you give some examples of nations where these types of laws don't exist and how it benefits their average citizens? I think once again there might be flaws in these systems but if you remove all regulations you will just end up with new problems.  And any major immediate changes to the banking system would cause financial chaos.  And I'm still not hearing about any specific laws or regulations.
 






Do you really think if Trump announced tomorrow the Federal Reserve board was now defunct things would be better? No financial chaos?  Everyone gets rich?  Where does this wealth come from?  The rich? Corporations? Other nations?
This is my point. We all love to regurgitate these sound bites we hear.  Fractional banking is bad, the fed is bad, regulations are bad.  But rarely do I see someone saying - bill  introduced by senator blah blah would limit XYZ in an attempt to close X loophole and prevent corporations from doing ABC.   Yawn.  That's no fun. It's more fun to just blindly complain and offer no real original insight.
Yes there are problems with the worlds financial systems. Bitcoin might help. But the matter is very complex. You can't just make sweeping changes. Look at brexit.  It's easy to say - Let's leave the EU!  But when you actually try and do it...  there are so many details that people don't agree on it's a nightmare. 
And yeah nothing is wrong with talking about these problems on a high level, it builds awareness which is good.  But I think it's also important to remember most of us here have only a very cursory understanding of how the system works. We aren't talking about the details because we don't understand them.  But if you really want change that's where it happens. The bankers have teams of very smart people digging into these details. We have moon memes.

How do you feel about rock climbing?  It serves no purpose, it's dangerous. Some people do get addicted to the rush of danger.
Moral banning is dangerous. I am sure there are things you do that others would think are unmoral.  Would you like being shamed for watching movies with curse words in it?  Or worshipping the wrong god?
When I say education I don't mean teaching someone that something is morally wrong. That never works. So with gambling if I was taught it was a sin and evil, but then try it anyways and discover it's not so bad I might still get addicted. I've always liked math so a big reason I don't gamble more is I understand the odds. Most of the addicts buying lotto tickets have no idea there is a 50% house edge. Or even how odds work. Where the guy with a phd in statistics buys 3-4 tickets a year when the jackpot gets huge and gets some enjoyment out of it. But he understands it's just entertainment and a BAD investment.

Also bitcoin can and will continue to exist w/o needing 3rd parties. But I can't see wide adoption w/o the use of 3rd parties.
Are there any estimates on how much bitcoin is being held offline as opposed to in exchanges?  I would think over time more will be held in banks/exchanges.  One of the problems with exchanges like Mt Gox was they were new and unregulated. Where newer exchanges like coinbase have purposefully tried to follow regulations and implement very tight security.  Using exchanges still carries a risk, but there are also risks with holding it yourself.  If you are an expert then controlling your keys is probably for the best. But if wide adoption happens most people won't be experts, they will be better off letting a bank or exchange keep their bitcoin for safe keeping.
Think about banks in the 1800s. They were robbed all the time, yet still some people thought their money was still safer in the bank than under their mattress. Now in 1850 if you were wealthy and could afford a giant safe and some men to guard it.  You would probably keep most your money there.  But even then they would probably keep some in the bank as well for ease of use.

So basically what you are saying is you have to secure your bitcoin same as you would have to secure your gold. Most people don't keep gold bars under their bed. They buy EFTs.  Pretty tough to steal an EFT.  And if you did have physical gold you should have it in a safe. The size and security of the safe/vault would be dependent on the value of the gold.
And people are human and make mistakes. I guess you could say bitcoin is impossible to steal or lose if you don't make any mistakes, but that is unrealistic. And anecdotally it does seem that bitcoin is easier to lose/steal than gold.  And lots of very intelligent people make mistakes. Doctors have amputated the wrong limbs, pilots get confused and crash, etc.

Or maybe they just don't care about bitcoin.   I am really into pinball, but if I asked a bunch of college students to name off some pinball machines I bet about 20% (maybe less) could name 1+. That doesn't make them stupid it just means they have a different interest than me.

Isn't this only used for illegal activity? Where do the bitcoins come from?  What happens if the internet is destroyed?  And those charts are way too complex.  People like graphics but they need to be very simple.
I also would lessen comparisons to gold.  We already have digital gold by way of EFTs.  It's like saying buy our cereal because it tastes like this other popular brand.  If you are going to compare bitcoin to gold explain why bitcoin is better.
Who cares about the halvings.  It's just going to confuse someone new to bitcoin. And you don't even mention mining at all.  Or the security of a global distributed network. Or the benefits of a global currency. Or the benefits of freedom from fiat. Or the problems with fiat.

You don't need to own crypto to have an opinion. Why do you care if your co-workers are anti bitcoin?  Maybe they are just tired of hearing about it. If bitcoin drops to $1,000 tomorrow will you go into work and tell your co-workers they were right? If not then what makes you right when it goes up?
Also all you seem to care about is the price. There are lots of questionable investments that have gone up huge percentages quickly. If you think bitcoin is a good thing, the price doesn't matter. Don't tie the value of bitcoin to the PRICE of bitcoin.
And remember lots of people on here seem to think bitcoin will go up forever and anyone that doesn't believe this is stupid and are missing out.  This is NOT true and a bad way to think when investing. I like bitcoin but I'm very aware that I can't see the future. When it was at $20k I never thought we would see it drop 70-80% but it did. Could it go up 100% in the next 30 days?  YES.  Could it drop 99% in the next 30 days. YES.  I think it's a good investment and will go up, but it's not a sure thing and it's not a good investment for everyone and that's ok.
