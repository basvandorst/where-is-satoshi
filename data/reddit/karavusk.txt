And that is why you don't put 144000 Bitcoins on a single wallet... and this is why hardware wallets are important but they probably weren't around in 2013.

Buy low sell high... never buy back at a peak, it definitely will drop down again, you just have to wait a week or two. Once that happens buy it again but definitely not at 4k, at least not right now.

Grab the hard drive you were using and try everything to restore the wallet.dat file. There is a chance that some recovery software will pick it up, hell even paying a professional company to try to restore it would definitely be worth it

Bought at 2337$ a few weeks ago and it was at about that price for a few days. Then I sold it for 2380$... jumped straight to 2800$

I would suggest using  for example. I just hope you didn‘t write too much stuff on that HDD. Pray that they can do their magic to get your 3,000,000$ back (and give me some if it works =P)

Well there are other cryptocurrencies right now with very small fees, you are not forced to use Bitcoin

Well you can just pay 0.001$ in transaction fees instead of 50 cents... 
The markup from miners selling their coins will always be there. The only option to change that is to mine yourself and sell cheaper than the rest

I am pretty sure this is 5 years too early... once you have scaling figured out to be able to support basically everyone then you can start looking to stop changes. Right now it is definitely too early and exchanges and other platforms with big influence over less educated people (lets be honest here, they are a massive factor over a big portion of the Bitcoin users) now gained the ability to instantly destroy any hardfork that improves bitcoin by calling it an altcoin even if people decide on it (not saying that it happened here, just talking about the general theory).

Well the problem with the behavior of Coinbase is that now that it happened once it can happen with EVERY change with Bitcoin. A hardfork is basically free money right now and from now on I am sure there will always be a person trying to keep the old chain alive if Bitcoin does a hardfork to update and improve something.
This goes beyond difficult, it creates confusion and could make it impossible to truly "update" Bitcoin without being forced to call it something else.

We hit 4k (or almost 4k?) and it went back down to like 2.2k
If you wait for like 3 moths it is very likely that it will drop again at some point. Sure I wouldn't wait for like 3k but at least something around 4k and definitely not at the point of all time high.

It effectively forces a hardfork and the old chain will die to it because it makes mining impossible.


The old not updated chains will ALWAYS die to the ice age, you can delay or remove it with another hardfork and keep everything else the same but it's impossible to keep that exact chain alive. No idea what is so funny about a simple principle and facts.
