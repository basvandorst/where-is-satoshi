I don't like the Lenny trackpads, but the clit mouse is one of my favorite features of the ThinkPads.

Even five years ago, hardware support was pretty good. Now it's amazing. Software support has drastically improved over the years, considering over half of my Steam library is Linux compatible (I have a total of 130 games, so about 70).

I'm running on Ubuntu certified hardware, so I haven't really come across many problems with crashing etc.
I've run GNU/Linux on a dying laptop (now dead), and came across a few issues frequent crashing and stalling.

I've never compiled an kernel (I'd love to try to make one of those floppy disk OS images), but I've compiled a load of programs, even dogecoind for ARMv6.

With Google Play Services, you're pretty much protected now as it scans APKs before installing the package.
Also I run Avast! on my Nexus 4 which is the second line of defence.

I got 1000 ripple a while ago for free, but I don't know anywhere that accepts them. I've been trying to get them exchanged for BTC.

Yeah, but I wouldn't root/jailbreak a device that had access to my cryptocurrency.

No law as such, but it's still morally and ethically wrong.

Really? I don't have a clue because I haven't checked the site in such a long time.
I guess it's safe to say it's a dead currency. Wasn't it all proprietary and closed source.

With Crossfireing, many chipsets will knock down the transfer rate of the bus. So, on my motherboard, if I use one card, it get 16x speed. If I Crossfire them, then both cards work at 1x.

I'm dead serious. Windo$e is a proprietary, dying mess. No I don't want to fucking install the Ask toolbar. DirectX and C# is really shitty (yes I know about Mono and dotGNU) and really isn't helping us in the GNU/Linux world.
Also, virtually every educational institution forces their students to use Micro$oft products thanks to bribing and lobbyists. Would you rather your kids use a corporate pile of junk or a piece of software created by people who are passionate about their project and not influenced by monetary gain? 
Just to let you know, I run ClamAV and use firewalls on my Linux machine, because I realise that every OS has some sort of vulnerability, but Linux less so, because the code is open to all, and anyone who discovers a hole can patch it and share with the rest of the community.
@_date: 2014-05-16 21:06:17


Closed source is terrible though. iTunes had a backdoor and was left open for 3 years until Apple finally patched it. I'm not saying that Linux is bulletproof, but it's better than closed source models.

Enterprise licence fees are insane really. As long as you make sure you have firewalls properly configured and that lusers use a modern browser (Chrome has it's own virus/malware/spyware/PUP scanner).
Or the simple answer is just to not use Micro$oft Windoze. GNU/Linux is suited to a lot of tasks - many people in an office just use word processors, spreadsheet software and browse the web. Any anything else can be virtualized with VMware or Citrix, or even just use Wine.

I started using Ubuntu as my daily driver at 10.04 LTS. When Unity came along I held onto 10.04 for dear life. It was definitely released too early. I'm running 14.04 LTS at the mo and it's a metric fucktonne better. Yes, there is definitely some work to do, but it is very nearly there. They need to replace the aging software center, but for the most part it is pretty polished.

My nexus 4 battery isn't incredible, but my Chromebook's is, so I charge it off that when I am out of the house. It lasts about 10 hours.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:54:23
It's basically just the chipset slowing down the bus, probably because the cheaper ones can't handle the bandwidth for two cards.

Out of interest, how can you get a vanity address? Also, can I do the same for altcoins like litecoin or peercoin?

It was a real shame when I got the newsletter and saw the fire. I don't have enough cash (or BTC!) to donate, but as soon as I have some spare money I'll be donating.
