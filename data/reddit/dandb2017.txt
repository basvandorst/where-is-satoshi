We had the most gold reserves because we had the most economic power.. Having the most gold reserves added to that power &amp; allowed our currency to become the world's reserve currency bc it was backed by the world's largest gold reserve.. Am I wrong?
China is on pace to have the most powerful economy within 15-20 years.. Am I wrong?
If China has the most economic power AND sits on the most digital gold, do you think they'll continue to let the world be backed by US Dollars? A dollar that is inflationary and not backed by anything but trust in OUR economy?
** Now that SatoXi admitted he wants China to embrace blockchain, people finally seem to be considering the theory that I presented in this post.
You're clearly a smart dude, but I think you either missed my point throughout this thread, or chose not to reply after you finally understood my point. 
Hoarding Bitcoin seems like a logical final piece to the puzzle for the yuan to eventually replace the dollar as the world's global currency.

It's probably all the people who had a cousin who talked about bitcoin 24/7 last year at Thanksgiving checking to see how bad the damage is

I get that they have a huge population, but they sensor their internet, what would keep them from sensoring/shutting down any mining operations?

I'm not talking about them preferring bitcoin, I'm taking about REQUIRING bitcoin to engage in any trade with China.. 
China couldn't make this kinda move without being the most powerful economy in the world, which is currently the direction things are headed.
Would you agree that at some point, if not already, the rest of the world will depend more heavily on China for its cheap labor and manufacturing than China will depend on the rest of the world to be consumers of their production?

Why? We're literally just now getting to the same page of understanding the hypothetical scenario I've laid out... 
If my qualifier changes your original answer, which it clearly does, go ahead and explain to me why China wouldn't eventually want to devalue the rest of the world's currency if they do in fact hold the largest amount of BTC. They would have the most to gain &amp; the least to lose.
Do you not believe that there is a very good chance that China holds the world's largest supply of BTC?
10-50 years from now, when China's GDP is the largest in the world, would China rather have a stable fiat currency and let bitcoin organically grow or fail into its own fate, or say to the rest of the world to either get with BTC or your currency will be devalued?
They would no longer control just their currency, they would control the world's currency.
Please don't "Just, stop." I genuinely want you to explain to me where the holes in this theory are.
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:41:55
Your explanation about why they wouldn't require their own people to use a single currency makes sense, but what about requiring any foreign payments to China or Chinese businesses to be in Bitcoin?
To be honest there's really no point in me trying to argue this scenario bc I have to keep on adding qualifiers, but I do think somewhere in the future this could be much more realistic and debatable than it is now.
If there's any scenario where China owns exponentially more bitcoin than any other country, central bank, investor, etc.. I wouldn't want to find out what they would do with that advantage 10-50 years from now as they reestablish themselves as the world's top economic power (unless I have a lot of bitcoin by then)
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:55:35
What if China happens to be the world's largest holder of bitcoin? I failed to mention that as a qualifier for this hypothetical, but wouldn't that kinda change things?
If China holds the most crypto, wouldn't they have the incentive to devalue fiat?
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:50:30
You didn't explain a single thing but okay. I've been humble and friendly this entire conversation, you have no reason to be acting like a wise ass.
BTC would be no threat to China if China controls the most BTC. I'd like for you to explain why that's not true... Or go fuck yourself. Either way is okay with me.

Whoever had the largest gold reserves in the 20th century (The US) had the most economic power &amp; was able to establish a worldwide monetary system that's backed by trust in the US Economy..
Whoever has the largest BTC supply in the 21st century will probably have more power than you can grasp right now.

You can spend it as fractions of pennies .0001 btc is worth like 50cents of USD
@_date: 2019-05-04 02:04:57
They control their own bitcoin, that's what I meant.. Not control of the bitcoin infrastructure, but control of their own wallets which like 1% of the wallets own like 60% of the circulating supply. That 1% controls their 60% supply of BTC
I should've used the word holds or owns
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:49:49
What if China already holds 30-50% of the 21,000,000 total supply?
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:10:23
Isn't the entire future of bitcoin a dream and a bunch of hypotheticals? 
How far fetched is it that China already owns $30-$50 billion USD worth of bitcoin? That's directed to you, I'll answer my remaining questions for you...
What was created to be a digital store of value/currency that could someday be an alternative to the heavily regulated world markets which are all backed by USD? 
Who has the most to lose if bitcoin ever becomes a widespread store of value / currency? 
Everyone who doesn't hold the most of it. 
Who am I assuming holds the most of it? 
Why am I assuming it's China? 
Because they are the world's leader in manufacturing output and are on pace to have a higher GDP than America within 10-20 years. That combined with control of a universal world currency would be pretty powerful.
How many years would this all take? Maybe 10-50 idk
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:38:12
So with as much gold as China is buying, do you not suspect that they are buying, or have already bought massive amounts of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:10:15
Well I should've been more clear that this scenario would be anywhere between 5-50 years away, likely closer to 50. China clearly doesn't have the economic dominance to make a move like this yet, but someday they will
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:19:54
I see what you're saying, but wouldn't the Chinese companies most likely be gaining the most of anyone in the pool?
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:53:26
No, bc apparently 1% of wallets already hold 61% of the total supply, so it's already happening, it's just a question of who that 1% is. 
Bitcoin can still do everything it was built to do bc it can be split into micro fractions

But what if China could have the highest level of control over a universal world currency (BTC)
Wouldn't they prefer that over total control of their own currency?
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:28:29
If China ALREADY owned 99% of the btc supply, I doubt it would go mainstream. That's completely irrelevant though, that's not what I'm arguing. I think you're completely missing my point.
I'm not talking about China buying 30% of the btc supply, I'm talking about them already having it.
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:36:31
If China owned 99% of the current circulating supply of bitcoin, that'd be about 17m of the total 21m bitcoin to ever be made. 
That would be absurd and would probably choke out the possibility for bitcoin to ever grow, so let's go back to the scenario I laid out which was 35% of the current supply... which would be around 6m total BTC worth roughly $35billion USD. 
Regardless of what the price rises to, they could always continue to hold at least 6million total BTC. So if BTC grows to a $5 trillion USD market cap, they could still have 35% of the total supply. Who knows how far bitcoin might or might not rise.
I understand there's a very good chance that China doesn't currently hold 6million BTC, but who knows if they do? We don't even know who created bitcoin. 
And excuse me, an American, for inferring that a country that's on track to surpass our GDP in as little as 10-15 years &amp; that we're currently in a trade war with might have some weird nefarious motives.
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:23:48
Yeah I see what you're saying, but I'm assuming in this scenario that they ALREADY have 30-50% of the 21 million total bitcoin supply.. I don't see that being an absurdly far fetched assumption, but maybe it is.. For the conversation's sake, let's say they do. 
The other 50-70% of bitcoin holders could do whatever they want, but if China somehow already does have about $30-$50billion USD worth of BTC, what would keep them from holding until BTC someday is worth say even just 50% of the value of gold?
I don't think anyone will ever come close again to surpassing China's manufacturing output, that alone is a lot of power, but controlling a finite digital currency that could devalue the US Dollar seems to me like something they'd be interested in.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:52:18
I failed to mention that this would all be based on my qualifying assumption that China is the worlds largest BTC holder... Whether that's the case or not, we may never know, but let's say China does control maybe 30%+ of the world's bitcoin supply... That would be my answer to why they would devalue their own (and the rest of the world's) currency.
If they do hold such a significant amount of BTC, they would like for all other currencies to be devalued &amp; for Bitcoin to become a universal currency that they would forever have the most control over
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:34:49
Interesting.. I don't doubt that at all
