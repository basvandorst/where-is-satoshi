Not to mention that theoretical tx/day is currently higher for "bcash" because segwit adoption is awful and Lightning is in Testnet.  I get that that might change in a hurry but it's a cheap meme for today.

Yes?  It's only theoretical in the sense that users aren't sending enough transactions whereas Lightning and Segwit require adoption.  I want a network with throughput.  So do you, that's why you (presumably) and I want Lightning to succeed.

Economics is not a zero sum game, but it is a positive sum game.  New wealth is created and the trend is positive.
I do agree with your point regardless.  Know it's a game and think about how those with the means are going to gain from your losses.

My personal thought is that they're going to start looking for loops and assessing taxes based on funds that came back to an exchange.  That is assuming that they can legally subpeona exchanges for transactions.  This would be unprecedented, but I don't think the US government cares when it comes to something they can fear monger about.

I'm thinking of gifting my sisters some BIP recovery keywords for Christmas and holding on to copies just in case.  I think that'd be a happy medium.

There's some good ones of folks recording what they do to a virtual desktop.  Normally they get you to enable remote desktop then the scammer either resets your password or transfers your home directory.

This is incredibly helpful, and helps me understand where folks see the diversion from proper protocol.  However, this does seem to imply that the core devs should be gatekeepers hard forks.  This seems somewhat contrary to the consensus methods that already exist, but I can understand why some groups would be supportive of the existing development pipeline.

Sure, I agree.  I'm all for being annoyed at the attempt to consolidate some corporate interests.  This post is more of a reaction to folks who feel that 2X as a protocol isn't "playing by the rules".  Your BIP paragraph helps explain that.

I think someone needs to invent a smart rig for areas that do not do net metering for solar panels.
Only going to offer me $0.04/KWH for my excess power?  Fine, I'll sell it to the network then.

I like his quote "Bitcoin is not about banking the unbanked, it's about unbanking the banked".

They didn't have majority at the time of the fork so I don't think that they followed the proper protocol for a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:12:29
I agree entirely here.  If nothing else, they should be concerned about replay attacks on their own network.

Ramsey will never change.  He's *super* conservative in his investment approach.  He'll tell you to save up to pay cash for a house even if it's within your budget and you can get a fixed rate of &lt;3.5%.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:06:12
But can't hard forks "become" the main chain with majority consensus in the previous block?

And 40 articles about the death of bitcoin despite $6k being much higher than most of its history.

I'm a noob, but AFAIK it's achieved  by slightly altering the ~~hashing~~ signing algorithm to prevent a transaction from being rebroadcast on the network that was forked from.

You're correct about where my confusion was, and this is a very helpful response.  Thanks for taking the time to explain on a thread that's not on the front page.  I appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:11:07
Unless I misunderstand, doesn't it look like 2x *will* have consensus?  Therefore they will be the "main chain"?
E: I suppose the point you're making is philosophical.  2x would move forward if they didn't have consensus so folks are angry that they are not acting in good faith.  Is this the correct interpretation?

There are a few good scenes but the movie is crap imo

OP has not shared their financial situation or risk tolerance, neither of which seems to be given much credence here.  Personally I would ask OP "If you had ~$40-50k in cash would you put it in Bitcoin today?".  If the answer is no he/she might want to consider what they would do with the value.
