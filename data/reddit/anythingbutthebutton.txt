I see that thinking logically doesn't come easily for you. Go read a book, son.

Just joined Reddit not too long ago after reading some of the posts on this sub dedicated to this fascinating technology. I've known about Bitcoin for a while now but never really gave it much thought until a few months ago when I listened to Andreas on Rogan's podcast. I had finally began to grasp the startling implications of such a disruptive technology and have since set up a wallet and bought a few dollars worth of Bitcoin to join and spread la révolution! 
I'm looking forward to learning more from this awesome forum! Cheers!

I am pessimistic about central authoritarian figures, backed by a central police force and military, who are prone to corruption. I would much rather let the market dictate the desires of the populace.


I believe in justice and objective law but why have a central authority oversee their enforcement? The market is more than apt enough for this.


I agree. Let me specify: I am against any *central* authority that presumes to rule over anybody. The force needed to enforce private property needs not arise from govt, private security firms can do this just as well if not more efficiently. 


Didn't you just say that it is pessimistic to view men as ignorant barbarians? I am assuming men are moral and rational actors, therefore no power-struggle through force or mob-warfare would arise because not only would they be immoral, but ultimately unprofitable. Now let me be clear: market anarchy can only work in a society that already has well-defined morals and rights (western society seems the closest to this). Minarchism would work better in more unstable areas such as Africa, IMO. I also believe that the transition to market anarchy should happen through minarchism first, to allow people enough time to adapt to their unshackled lifestyle. However, the transition to a stateless society must happen lest we commit the same mistake we made with the US govt, which we let grow to its current unsustainable size.

One could argue that the United States after the revolution was a sort of minarchist society. However, look at where we've ended up. So long as violence stays monopolized and the guns stay concentrated in the hands of the few, they will always seek to extend their authority. The state is insatiable and power corrupts. It's wishful thinking to hope that the govt will stay within predefined bounds, even if it is voluntarily financed.

Around [$450 million,]( if you include this week's slew of investments. I doubt we'll hit the 1bn mark by the end of this year. Nevertheless, over half a billion dollars is still quite a significant amount.

Yes, right now it's a bad idea. But what about in 5-10 years when consumer devices are orders of magnitude more energy efficient than they are today? I think 21 has the right idea and I can't wait to see where this tech will be in a few years from now. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 06:19:15
Is that still a thing?

I find your abundance of faith disturbing.

Too bad you don't understand basic accounting.

Donated. Would be awesome if he endorsed Bitcoin publicly.

Nice! Definitely the best iOS wallet out there. $2 @_date: 2015-02-02 00:11:59
Just introduced a friend to bitcoin by sending him $1 through Changetip. Best way to convince people, imo.

In my city we have a cash to crypto only ATM. No personal info required at all, only a wallet installed on your phone.

Well said. 2000 bits
