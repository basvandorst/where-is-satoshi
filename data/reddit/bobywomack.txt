Ok, another one. I've seen there are a lot of other crypto currencies out there. What's preventing a big company such as google, amazon or similar to create their own crypto currency based on SHA256, that could be mined with bitcoin mining machine? And then accepting only this one as a method of paiement.

But if bitcoin should be replaced by a more secure coin, wouldn't its price collapse?
Then isn't buying bitcoin a huge risk in the long term, if you expect it to be replaced by another coin?

Is there a link between mining and securing the transactions?
From what I understand, mining is roughly verifying the transactions being made. Difficulty is added and everything, but from what I get, minners get paid to be a part of the network Can you confirm it?
If it is so, my next question would be, what will happen with the network once all bitcoins are minned? Will there be some kind of incentive for minners to stay in the network instead of moving to another currency or just stop? If not, what will happen to those holding bitcoins at that moment?
(Textbook moronic questions, I guess)

Great answer, thanks

Bitcoin are supposed to get mined for a long time still, at least 100 years if I'm correct. By then, won't super computers be invented that can crack Bitcoin's cryptography?
Supposing that this would be a possibility, can the algorythm evolve along the years to make it more secure?

Precisely, I don't see Bitcoin taking all that value + doubling it.

Because it is a lot more money. It is orders of magnitudes bigger than the global stock market, according to this page

I think going from 0 to 18 billions is much easier than going from 18 billions to 2.5 - 2.7 quadrillions.

Hi there! 
I am not currently running a node, and I think this is a good opportunity to start. 
I have a raspberry pi available, and a proper internet connection. Can I run Bitcoin XT on my raspberry pi? I imagine I will need to add storage capacity, is 32/64 gb SD card enough?

Thank you!

You dont DCA to get the best Price. You DCA to get peace of mind and not worry about the price,while still getting exposed.

Do or don't, you'll regret it and enjoy it in both cases.
Don't buy more than you are willing to lose. This is a crazy bet at best, not an investment.
