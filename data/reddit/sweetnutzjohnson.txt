I read this article earlier today. The errors, misleading statements and the exploitation of this gentleman's situation need to addressed.    CNN Money is completely wrong for this.

I heard that authorities were threatening Venezuelans who had Bitcoin. Demanding their keys. Is this true?

Great clip. Thomas Lee explained his position backed by solid research. And he articulated it in plain English.
Thank you. Thomas Lee is up with Andreas Antonopoulos - ambassadors of cryptocurrency

They're plenty of clips of Lee discussing his position and presenting his research. Here is a detailed presentation he gave discusses his position. 
Whether you agree or disagree, you cannot dispute the facts that he is informed and presenting valid research.

Checked the site, good idea.  Im curious as to why some banks have split ratings (close to 50/50).  What are signs that they look for to flag or block a transaction? What criteria do they use to close an account? Bottom line the banks run a business, we are their clients. If they don't want our $ that's fine, we can take our business elsewhere.

Are you from Venezuela? Im curious to know how Maduro is educating folks about cryptocurrency. Because if he wants to push the petro, he has to educate people about Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.  And show people how to use it. I recognize it is not an ideal situation, but could this move actually help the Venezuelan people out as cryptocurrency was intended to??

Rogan usually has on good guests. Sometimes he does not. He interviewed Andreas Antonopoulos before and it was a good interview.
