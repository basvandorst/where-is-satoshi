Please stop writing "alt/scam coins".  Some alternatives to Bitcoin may be scams but not all are. Many were created with good intentions. 
The phrase "alt/scam" pretends to acknowledge a difference, but every time you repeat it you reinforce the idea that all alternatives are bad. It's accusation by word association, and it's unfair.

I think "bitcoin" itself is a bit daft, to be honest.
@_date: 2013-07-25 08:52:45
I think part of the logic is, and I'm *not* saying I agree with it:
 
0/ Bitcoin is a nascent thing lots of people are unsure about   
1/ MSM Bitcoin press often imentions anonymity, lack of regulation, money laundering, Silk Road etc    
2/ This causes people to associate Bitcoin with "bad things"  
3/ Now have a story where Ponzi and Bitcoin appear in headline together  
4/ Bitcoin = bad things feelings amplified  
Of course you could have a Ponzi scheme in dollars. That isn't the point. We're talking about impressions, not facts. Lots of media, and media consumers, won't let facts get in the way of a good story or an existing prejudice.

"Playing" is the key word. This is only a mind game, similar to the military simulations countries carry out. They are as much, if not more, about theory as practice or preparation. Just because, say, Israel might carry out a simulation where they attack (or are attacked by) Iran, that doesn't necessarily mean they are planning anything along those lines. Hell, Switzerland ran a simulation just recently that was based around the idea of being [invaded by the French](

No. Read the community rules, especially this one:

@_date: 2013-09-04 10:02:13
That isn't quite how it works. Income tax isn't collected at the border. If somebody from outside the EU -- say Switzerland -- enters Germany with more than 10,000 euros in cash, Germany can't charge income tax, can it? That person isn't resident in Germany.
Now, in the situation in the article, they *are* German citizens, so yes German income tax rules apply ... eventually. 
The problem isn't that they are carrying cash, just that they are not declaring it. 
If you declare and it isn't obvious you're lying, the authorities pass your form to the tax office, who can double check you're paying the right income tax amounts.
If you don't declare, like the people in the article, then they can seize the money and you have to wade through paperwork to get it back.
My main point is that it is not illegal to carry more than 10,000 euros in and out of the EU. It is illegal to carry more than that amount without declaring it.
And, it is worth pointing out that you can carry any amount you like in cash between EU countries. You don't have to declare at all.

Yeah, trends over time would be good. I'm still new to the reddit API but I don't think this would be too difficult to achieve.
As for there being enough data, I could see about bundling terms together. The category I'm most interested in is the first one, negative words. It was my gut feeling that lots of submissions seemed to be about negative aspects of Bitcoin, and I wanted to see if I could quanitify that.
I could also perhaps try looking at a snapshot of the ~~top~~ hot submissions, rather than a snapshot of the most recent ones. That might give a better indication of what the community deems important.

Neither, really, or both -- it depends on your POV.
If you're an Average Joe in the USA who wants a straightforward way of buying bitcoin then it's an advantage. You give Coinbase money. It gives you bitcoin. Coinbase has links with the US banking system, which is convenient: it means you can just wire the money. You don't have to use a payment processor to get your money to them.
If you're extremely price-conscious then you might consider it a disadvantage, because Coinbase is understandably sometimes more expensive than markets. Their "spread" -- the difference between the buy price and the sell price -- is larger: it has a margin built in so they can make money.
Coinbase is a bit like a broker. Imagine you want to buy some stock in a company, or an oil future, or a portfolio of bonds. You could find out which markets they're all traded on, create accounts to trade in those markets, and then wait for them to open to make your deals. Or, you could go to a broker who will do a lot of the legwork for you.

I'd include a one-line explanation of Bitcoin between "next event" and the links to websites.
At the moment, it goes like this. I'm the merchant. Receive an unsolicited email (some might call it spam, and have a lot of right to). It's about Bitcoin, something I vaguely remember hearing on the news. I've got dozens of other emails to go through but I'll scan it, who knows. "I'm looking for blah blah Bitcoin ..." Visit three websites to find out more? The phone's started ringing. Whatever. Delete.
First questions merchants are likely to ask are: Who are you? What do you want? Why should I care? Don't make them do the work in getting initial answers to those questions. Include the links later, as a way of "learning more", on top of the enticing new knowledge you have given them.

As an EU citizen, I would hope that companies using bitcoin as a payment system would follow the law and abide by the standard [consumer protection rights]( that protect me if I use other currencies.
I'd also hope that in the event of any claim I made, the appropriate body would recognise that just because I am using bitcoin as a currency, that doesn't mean I should waive my rights.
But since so many of the companies that pop up here in Bitcoinland neglect their obligations with regards to the various consumer directives, either deliberately or ignorantly, I would naturally be more discerning about who I bought from. 
As an example, *"EU law requires that sellers give you full details of who they are, what they are selling, and how much it costs (including taxes and delivery charges)."* [[source]( Often it's very difficult or impossible to find even a registered company name, let alone a registration number or address, on many of the sites that offer goods and services for bitcoin.

Google deals with 3 billion searches a day. Facebook has hundreds of millions of users.
For every reason you give as to why they should adopt bitcoin, they will likely have a better one as to why they shouldn't -- at least not now. Bitcoin is still an edge case: few benefits for lots of hassle.

That's an assumption. They might be clued up, but have decided it won't work for them, or isn't worth the effort of implementing it.


This is not always true -- even with a service such as Bitpay -- and you shouldn't assume it is. There are often tax, financial reporting, legal and software issues to deal with, and these will vary from company to company. 
For that reason I'm not sure sending a "concise stock email" -- a canned response, basically -- after they have said no, is the best method. 
If you are going to go back and hassle them after they've replied saying no, I think it best to make sure the email is customised. Have a list of talking points to work from, sure, but make sure it isn't obviously a cut-n-paste job.

Simple -- you just enter your seed into each copy of Electrum. The wallet will automatically synchronise between copies.


That's right: it's not an issue. The change addresses are included in the deterministic sequence that the seed gives you access to.
*edit to add*: What I really like about Electrum is that it does away with the idea that bitcoins are "stored" on a particular computer, something that I think trips a lot of people up. 
Bitcoins don't really exist, at least not in one place. All that anyone owns is the right to claim certain transactions in a ledger benefit them. With Electrum, the passphrase is all you need to assert that right.

I think this is, like most reddit raids, a terrible idea. A flood of people in one place, junking up a thread with tips, is likely to turn people off as much as turn people on.
Imagine you're sitting in a bar having a pleasant conversation with your friends. Lively debate, but not massively serious, and you think Fiona, Mary's new roommate, might have a crush on you. All-round great evening.
Then in walk about a dozen uniformed proselytizers you don't know from Adam, and haven't seen in this bar before. They stand around listening over your shoulder, and then begin handing out dimes to some of you and telling you about their cause. 
The conversation flow you had is gone. Who are these people? What do they want? Why did they give Dave a dime, but not Bob? You'd like these people to go away -- you were having a great time without them -- but they keep on interrrupting you to put dimes on the table. Then more people appear, with more dimes to put on the table, and then someone starts handing out leaflets. What a bunch of weirdos.
Persistent weirdos, though. They end up ruining the night. Fiona's a bit freaked out: she's new to this part of town. (It happens to be your part of town, which makes you a bit angry with the people handing out dimes -- you really hope she doesn't hold it against you personally.) You ask the bartender if he can get these people to leave. Some go willingly. Others don't. 
Next time you all go out you're hesitant about returning to that bar, even though you enjoy it there. Somebody suggests another place, near the railway station. Fiona says she'll give it a miss. You make a silent promise, if someone tries to interrupt you again to hand you a dime and a leaflet, not to listen to what they have to say.

Here are some reasons why not to use a bitcoin-based crowdfunding platform rather than Kickstarter or Indiegogo:
1. You want to make it easy for people to donate. The number of people who have PayPal accounts or credit cards is orders of magnitude higher than those who have either heard of bitcoin or actually have any. Crowdfunding is all about converting: capture somebody's attention with your pitch and make them take out their wallet. The more barriers you put up, such as having to learn about bitcoin, buy some, make a transaction, the fewer people will donate.
2. Your funding period lasts longer than a week. In that time, the value of bitcoin could drop by 50% or more. It could also raise by 50% or more, but either way this isn't a good thing, because ...
3. Your project involves a business plan that is denominated in a traditional currency. This is required because all your suppliers operate in traditional currencies, so you need to cost things that way. You also have to pay taxes in the traditional currency of where you live.
4. Neither you, nor your financial and legal counsel, is comfortable operating with a company (Bitcoinstarter) that, under claims of "the spirit of bitcoin", obfuscates its contact details on its FAQ page because they "will be taking on some controversial projects as you might imagine". You're not convinced either by its use of a standard Gmail account as a business contact address.

You didn't call it a good investment in your original post. You called grandma "a very smart investor". Those are two different things. Bad football teams can still win the odd game and a stopped clock is still right twice a day.

You say you have some capital for the house bank. What happens if someone comes and wins it all, or a large chunk ofit, on the first bet? What happens if the value of Bitcoin crashes, and you have to reduce the maximum stake to the equivalent of pennies? How will you get people to bet then?
How much will you spend on marketing?
What are your other overheads? How will you pay server costs? Where will you host the website -- have you found a host that's willing to host a site that might be breaking the law? Do you know a lawyer, in case you need one? How will you respond to any forthcoming changes in legislation?

In all seriousness, you don't know enough about OP's grandma's investing skills to say she is very smart, and you can't gauge those skills from the one data point OP provides. 
If bitcoin was now worth nothing, would you be calling her a stupid investor? What if you learned that $1000 was her entire lifesavings -- would it be smart to invest it all in bitcoin? What if you learned that $1000 was chump change to her, the kind of money she wouldn't blink at spending on a necklace? Is she still "very smart"?
People should not canonize all those who suddenly find themselves wealthy as though they are super-intelligent visionaries. At lot of the time, including with bitcoin, it's blind dumb luck -- not "smarts". Would you call OP's grandma a smart investor if she spent $1000 on lottery tickets and won $20,000?

I wasn't suggesting that you were intending to hype bitcoin; more that your involvement with it was blinding you to the possibility that there are other things, nothing to do with bitcoin, that are also innovative. Just because someone is not working with bitcoin, that doesn't mean they are "not very innovative".


The URI scheme is already here, and it works, in exactly the same way as mailto://. 
If you open a bitcoin:// link with Firefox it might say it doesn't recognise it -- but that's only because your wallet software hasn't implemented it. When you associate a program with the URI, tick a box and Firefox can open that program in future.
What more would you have Mozilla do? Most people in the world don't use bitcoin, so why should they suddenly start shoehorning it into the browser experience? 
It is down to add-on developers, I think, to extend the functionality of Firefox (or Chrome) to include bitcoin in other ways. If these add-ons become widely used, Mozilla can look at incorporating them in the core browser in future.


Apple won't let Firefox use its own web engine (Gecko) on iOS, which is why they're not there
But again, iOS != mobile. The Firefox browser for Android exists and is very good. And Mozilla is developing its own mobile OS for low-end smartphones and emerging markets.

Short answer: No, mining is not worth it. At this stage, you need dedicated, very expensive hardware, and the blockchain (the shared public ledger of all bitcoin transactions) is large, several gigabytes, so not suitable with your connection.
But that doesn't mean you can't get into bitcoin. Mining is not the only way them. You could buy some, or, if you have any skills you could earn some (see You don't necessarily need a strong internet connection with lots of bandwidth, but you should certainly look at what are called "thin" or "lite" wallet clients, such as Electrum or Multibit. These don't require you to download the whole blockchain.

To correct trade imbalances. If you devalue your currency, you make exports cheaper. People in other countries with stronger currencies can buy more of your stuff.
At the same time, you make imports more expensive. Your currency isn't worth as much, so people find it more expensive to buy stuff from abroad. Instead, the theory goes, they'll shop or produce at home.
This is sometimes good for government balance sheets, but often bad for the average citizen. If you need stuff from abroad, it's more expensive. Even if you don't, savings you stockpiled are not worth what they once were. So people turn to other ways of storing their wealth -- like gold, or bitcoin.


In theory, yes, but just because you can look up the prices on ten different exchanges online, that doesn't mean you can shop at all those ten exchanges.


Because they perhaps can't easily deposit their money at BTC-E. As far as I know, it's based in Bulgaria, which means international money wires (cost, regulation, limits on transfers) and cross-border identity checks (foreign language, jurisdiction) for both deposits and withdrawals. The convenience and greater certainty of using local, Chinese-based exchanges may be worth the premium.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:43:25
There is in theory. Have a look at this wiki page:
*Every transaction can have a lock time associated with it. This allows the transaction to be pending and replaceable until an agreed-upon future time, specified either as a block index or as a timestamp (the same field is used for both, but values less than 500 million are interpreted as a block index). If a transaction's lock time has been reached, we say it is final.*
Example 1 ("Providing a deposit") on the wiki page sounds similar to what you describe.
Bitcoin contracts are fascinating. There's also a link on that page to a good video featuring Mike Hearn that explains some of these ideas in more detail.

EwoutDVP isn't making a case that the two communities aren't related. They have presented a case that the only links in the sidebar should be explicitly about bitcoin. 
I happen to agree that most people here probably aren't dyed-in-the-wool libertarians or ancappers. There may be an overlap, but has about 12,000 subscribers to Bitcoin's roughly 46,000. 
I think EwoutDVP is right about people being turned off by particular ideological labels, too -- in the same way people reject a proposal just because it came from a Republican or a Democrat, regardless of the proposal's merits, I believe a lot of people new to Bitcoin will see those sidebar links and think "Anarchy?! Um, no thanks. Not getting involved in that."
Not to mention the criteria for being a "related community" are a bit wishy-washy -- as EwoutDVP [outlined]( 
Like so often, the simplest solution is the best. Have only explicit Bitcoin subs linked in the sidebar.

For bitcoin to reach "mainstream adoption" and coexist with "**fiat** banking [my emphasis], governments would have to be willing to tolerate bitcoin on a reasonably large scale. That isn't a guarantee at this point.
If it does happen, though, I agree that fiat banks won't just disappear. Loans and access to capital will still be important.

I felt this was a terrible discussion, like Newsnight discussions sadly often are. The BBC, like other media outlets, really pushes [a binary debate]( with people in For and Against camps. Everything is starkly delineated. Yes, No. Black, White. Good, Bad.
The end result is the worst kind of discussion: an argument where both sides try to "win", by proving the other person "wrong". Never give the middle ground. But like [Daniel H. Cohen says]( that's a terrible way to approach an argument: the person who truly "wins" in an argument is the one who comes away with new knowledge and understanding, even if his original position wasn't correct. 
We had a confrontational, battle argument here. Keiser came across as shrill, I-Told-You-So, and unhelpfully unwilling to admit some of bitcoin's problems. I don't agree, for example, that there's no currency risk: you simply can't "instantly" convert bitcoin into British pounds. 
For his part, the Forex guy seemed awkward in his role. He claims he investigated bitcoin a couple of years ago, had "a play around", and sold it "about two days ago". If that's true then he has surely made a tidy profit. So why be so dismissive of "an internet affectation"? It was almost as if he hadn't made his mind up on bitcoin, or had doubts, or held contradicting views. He should be allowed to -- he's a human. But the TV rubric that a discussion like this forces demands something else.
You can't expect everything in a six-minute interview, and again, a lot of this might be structural -- "good TV building". But for somebody who had never heard of bitcoin before, or had heard a bit and wanted to know more, this was a lot of noise and not enough signal.

This has been the case for ages. It's common knowledge. It's certainly not "new".

Perhaps if you're a mom n pop store. Not necessarily if you're a billion dollar multinational that has taken investment funding (and so has executives to acquiesce), pays tens of millions of dollars in licensing fees every year to artists (and so has record label arrangements to uphold), and operates in a regulated, notoriously litigous space.
A company that size can't "just use Bitpay". They'd require a very specific SLA from Bitpay to even consider implementing it, which means legal and finance teams knocking heads to negotiate terms. They'd need to do a code audit to work out if and how Bitpay can integrate into the existing systems they use (I'm talking backend finance systems, not the button the user sees on the website), any potential flaws, weaknesses, problem points etc. They'd also have to build a filter so that people in regions where Spotify is not offered or restricted cannot purchase subscriptions -- more legal liabilities there.
All that is assuming that Spotify has decided the market potential is there. How many Bitcoin users would *actually* use it to purchase Spotify subscriptions? Bitcoin is a tiny pie as it is. Would the Bitcoin revenue they generate make up for the costs they spend to implement it (employee hours, paying lawyers etc)?

I am surprised that people are so surprised and outraged about this. It was always bound to happen. Nobody should have taken the site so seriously; BTC-TC itself admits it does not operate as a proper exchange. This is from [BTC-TC's own FAQ](










BTC-TC has gone to great pains to stress that it isn't the real thing. The shutdown announcement has "issuers" and "investors" in quotation marks, and the FAQ continues: *"We do not pretend that we are a real registered exchange. We do not pretend the assets on the site are real."* 
People who have failed to heed the site's own advice and are heavily invested should count themselves lucky they have so long to execute an exit plan (which they should have, right?)

I see. Thanks for clarifying. Looking at theSourceForge figures, it appears [May]( was when China "discovered" Bitcoin.
I still think, though, that saying it "overtook" the USA is a bit obvious and doesn't signify much. You would almost expect there to be a period when that happened. 
Firstly China has roughly three times the population of the USA, and although internet penetration is not as high in China, the country still has [more internet users]( than the USA. 
Secondly, if China starts downloading BitcoinQT in numbers from scratch when the US market has already saturated to some extent, then of course there will be a period when it "overtakes" the USA. In [June]( and [July]( BitcoinQT downloads in China were back below less than half those in the USA. 
Typical pinch of salt needs to be taken with all this, of course. BitcoinQT downloads don't tell the whole story.

Well, I am a very infrequent Bitcoin user. I own less than 1 BTC. And yet that small amount is scattered over half a dozen addresses.
I use a fresh address for each incoming transaction -- like we're recommended to -- and I use a wallet (Electrum) that generates new addresses as I need them. There's no "keeping track of multiple balances" beyond launching the wallet software.
If somebody is trading Bitcoin, or is a merchant that accepts them, and they use a fresh address every time they transfer Bitcoin to their personal wallet -- like they're recommended to -- I don't see why they wouldn't have addresses in the tens or more, each with an amount.


It is. You could argue it demonstrates Bitcoin's versatility for transferring both large and small amounts.
@_date: 2013-09-19 22:37:17
The responses seem a bit muddled to me:


Firstly, bitcoin was not set up by "a company" (well, as far as we know ... \*X-Files music\*). It certainly isn't maintained by one.
Secondly, the phrase "giving a digital representation of money" is interesting. I'm not sure what to make of that. Also, "a true digital currency". What's needed for authenticity?
Later in the piece, we get the line that "As long as they have a smartphone, [users] can buy the Mint’s digital money."
So it's not merely a digital representation of the Canadian dollar, then? But something different?
From a government mint's point of view, I actually think there's something in the idea of them saying "We're going to set up a blockchain of X amount of dollars; you can convert some of your coins and notes into entries on the ledger, and then use them for quick digital transactions all over the place." It's certainly cheaper than minting coins and notes, could work pretty well if enough locations and services accepted it, and like the article points out, wouldn't take much to maintain. Hell, if they offered tax breaks for people willing to mine transactions, they could get the public to do it for them.
Of course, it could also make it easier for a central bank to pump more money into a system. But at least the ground would be primed for people to switch to bitcoin if that happened and they wanted to -- they'd be more used to the idea of using digital money.

The issue isn't just that it's more difficult for people in the UK to get bitcoin than it is in other countries, nor that bitcoins are illegal (they're not).

Yes, but this is only for people who choose to push their code to a public Github repo.
Since PayPal and Stripe are used in projects involving financial transactions / credit card data, I bet there is MUCH more code using those two than bitcoin stored in private repos, whether that's on Github or elsewhere.
In your article, you write:


I think this is classic user bias. Thousands of developers work for private companies that have their own version control systems and don't touch Github at all. And just because a developer has a Github  account, that doesn't mean he or she publishes all of her code there. 
In short, I don't think Github *is* that good a place to approximate "Developer Mindshare".
I'd also take issue with the phrase "using modern tools". It strikes me as a bit snobbish. Many of those private company developers could be stuck using legacy tools and code. But even though they aren't upgrading to the latest Rails or Meteor or Nodejs stack -- or indeed using git over another VCS -- that doesn't mean they aren't contributing code that matters or has an impact. Large parts of the finance world runs on Excel and VBA (seriously!)


I really don't follow this logic. Surely people could also do work in their spare time and store it in private repos?

Fantastic article. More submissions like this, please, people!
Regarding your question, this part caught my eye:


First of all, yes, yes, yes.
Secondly, it reminded me of [something John Gray said]( that *"the freedom Bitcoin promises is an illusion, it's one that will always have a grip on the human mind -- the dream of finding some kind of talisman, a benevolent tyrant or a magical new technology, that can shelter us from power and crime and protect us from each other"* [last paragraph in article].
In that sense, even if Bitcoin is Rousseau's General Will to a Hobbesian bank oligopoly, it still won't stop humans from the "war of all against all".
Looking at it another way, and extending your idea of Bitcoin as a different type of "monetary faith", you could argue that the code, cryptography and protocols that make up virtual currency blockchains are themselves a sort of Hobbesian oligopoly. 
Yes, they are open source, and yes, their functions are distributed among users. But they still make up a system. At some point -- perhaps we have already passed it -- the number of Bitcoin users will be so large that the majority of users will place the same amount of trust and faith in the system as they do -- or did -- in banks. Most people won't know or care how the code does what it does. They just want it to make sure they have the right amount of Bitcoins.
There's another level of trust, of course -- the code can't, by itself, weaken the value of somebody's money -- sorry, COGAS. But even then, like you say, we're back to the dirt and grit of the real world. Just because the code can't screw that up, doesn't mean we won't screw it up ourselves somehow in the "war of all against all".
So, yes, your Bitcoin might be seen as "a popular democratic vote". But you know what they say about democracy: it's just the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.

I can see how particularly strict code inspectors might interpret the following section with a heavy bias against the homeless:

*(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to keep on any street any firewood, empty boxes or barrels, shavings, bricks, refuse, building materials or any carriage, cart, wagon or other vehicle except as authorized by this chapter or permitted by the director of sanitation services.*
*(b) It shall be unlawful to sweep into or deposit in any street any papers, trash or rubbish, or to fail to collect and put the same into receptacles.*
*(c) It shall be unlawful for any person to throw or deposit on any street or sidewalk any trash of any kind whatsoever.*
I hate to trade in stereotypes, but homeless people often have some kind of "carriage, cart or wagon" [a] to make transporting their few belongings much easier.
They may place some of their belongings on the street, which could be interpreted as depositing trash or rubbish. It may even be actual trash they intend to dispose later [b, c].

It is [open source]( and written in Python, which is a well-established and widely-used language. If development and maintenance on Electrum did stop or slow to a crawl, there's a very good chance somebody else would pick it up. 
And even if that didn't happen, it's a safe bet there'd be somebody out there who could look at the code -- as long as there's at least one copy of it somewhere -- and determine how to restore your wallet from the seed. 
Just keep that seed safe :)

Mining is not profitable unless you have expensive, dedicated hardware. The mining problems are so difficult to solve now that normal CPUs and graphics cards don't cut it.


Did you download the bitcoin-qt client? If so, then the client will need to download a copy of all the transactions to date (the blockchain) before the wallet is fully synchronised. Heads up: this can be a large file -- several GB. 


Forget about mining :)
Look into what are known as "thin" or "lite" clients such as Electrum or Multibit. These allow you to have a bitcoin wallet on your local machine without needing to download the whole blockchain.

I can see the blog belongs to the article's author, and I can see the author is a Bitcoin bigshot, but the link to the [original article]( is right there above the copy-n-paste job. I think the submitter should have used that.

I don't think this submission belongs here. As the Community Rules say:


Some in this thread have argued this submission is "relevant" because the problem in the news article is one that Bitcoin can solve. 
That seems a stretch to me, and the thin end of a wedge. 
But if the community does find these sorts of submissions worthwhile, perhaps the submitter could edit the submission title a little to explain why it is relevant to Bitcoin. Without any context, the /new and /front pages will just become links to news stories, which could lead to lots of off-topic discussion -- there's already one tangent here about regulation for bulletproof vests -- or valueless "Bitcoin user not affected!" comments.
The only person so far [suggesting]( this doesn't belong here is somebody who has a reputation as a troll. I'm not trolling; I hope people can see that from my tone. But in this case I agree, and I suggest there needs to be a discussion about what's considered off-topic and what isn't.

Escrow is a system where a third-party looks after something (e.g. money) until a contract is fulfilled. When all parties are satisfied, the money is released.
Say I want to buy something off you, like a bicycle. I don't know you and you don't know me. If I send you the money first, you could just disappear and not give me the bicycle. But if you give me the bicycle first, I could disappear and not give you the money.
To solve this problem: I give money to the escrow provider. Only when you deliver the bicycle, and I'm happy that it is as advertised, will the escrow provider release the funds.
Internet auction sites like eBay have escrow systems built in. They are designed to protect buyers and sellers from scams.

Even with statements like that it is hard to take this company seriously. 
There are tight restrictions on selling and buying alcohol and they vary from country to country, even within the European Union. There is no information on the website about a company name, registration number, address, history, and any applicable licenses that might be needed to wholesale or distance sell alcohol worldwide.
Either the company has not done its homework -- even with "over 20 years of domestic experience" -- or it is deliberately ignoring legal requirements. The suggestion that items are dispatched as [gifts in "discreet boxes" to avoid import taxes]( should ring alarm bells here. 
The 18+ rule doesn't reassure either. How will it be verified? What about countries with different ages to purchase alcohol?
This doesn't have the feel of a legitimate business venture. Instead it feels like a fly-by-night operation whose operators are looking to make some quick bitcoin. 
We have seen these before. There was one a while back that sold OTC pharmaceuticals and was similarly vague on details.
These fuzzy companies further reinforce the idea that Bitcoin Is The Black Market's Best Friend. Something to think about if you would like bitcoin to gain wide acceptance and be tolerated, or ignored, by regulators and governments.

This is blogspam and the story is being covered in this subreddit already. While I have nothing against reposts -- they do provide a chance for people who missed out the first time something was submitted -- I do take exception to people submitting substance-free articles when there's an active thread less than 24 hours old on the very same topic. 
This article is four paragraphs long and nothing but a rewrite of the original press release. It has a link to that press release at the end of the article, wrapped up for whatever reason in a URL shortener ("Cool URIs don't die!"). The original press release is here:
More context: The -magnates suffix seemed familiar, so I looked up the URL on whois and it turns out that yes, paymentsmagnates.com uses the same nameserver as forexmagnates.com, another site that has been submitted to this subreddit lately. It's fair to assume the two sites are linked.

Yes, the argument is about what words mean. FWIW, the Oxford English Dictionary agrees with me:
*"hope of gain but with the risk of loss"*
*"expectation of achieving a profit"*
I'm not denying there's always a risk, or that sometimes investments can be or go bad. The key difference, for me, is in the thought and intention at the time of putting money in. If I expect to make a return, I'm investing. If I hope to make a return, but realise there's a good chance I might not, then I'm speculating. 
Investment and speculation are not two discrete things; more like a spectrum. At some point, the risk of loss pushes an investment into the speculation category. But that's different for different people: what you might consider an investment becomes a speculation for me, because the risk is so great I wouldn't expect to profit from it.




I'm not sure what you're saying here. I don't see why you couldn't invest in all those things -- like I said earlier, the usefulness need not be to yourself for something to be valuable and provide a return. Return need not always be monetary, either.

The idea about cloud management sounds interesting. The device is so small somebody could set up a few of them scattered about their local region and gather traffic from passers by.


Hmm... When you generate the Bitcoin address that shows up is there any way you could link it to the MAC? Maybe use the MAC (or part of it) when generating the private key?
That way it wouldn't matter where the payment came from. The block would just be lifted as soon as payment hits the address. 
Another suggestion -- maybe for version 2; I realise I'm getting a bit carried away here :) -- make the block page appear after a certain amount of free browsing time, not straight away. Could be useful for cafes and whatnot who want to entice people in.
@_date: 2013-08-10 12:16:06


Not really. It requires making sure that "those few lines of code" fit in with the existing codebase you have and aren't going to cause security or performance problems. It might require writing extra lines of code elsewhere, too, such as in your payments reporting system. 
That's assuming that you have the technical knowhow to deal with those extra lines of code. If you don't, it means spending money to hire somebody who does.
Deciding to accept Bitcoin might also require speaking to an accountant or a finance lawyer to see if or how it will impact any fiduciary or tax requirements a business has. Accountants and lawyers don't normally talk to people for free, so that means spending more money.

No -- Electrum's 12-word seed isn't a password. It's used to create all the addresses in the wallet, and this doesn't include imported wallets.

The answers to the question "How do I know those doctors are real doctors?" in the FAQ fail to convince.




Just because doctors can review them, that doesn't mean they will. And surely it's the answers that the supposed doctors give that need reviewing. 


How does the fact I don't have to pay guarantee the quality of the response I get? I presume the argument is that if I'm not satisfied I don't have to pay, which means that the doctor has to give good advice if he wants to be paid. 
But if I'm asking a doctor for help, it's because I don't know enough about my condition. So how do I know what is good advice? The doctor could give an answer that *sounds* informative and correct, but it could actually be bogus. I don't know. I'm none the wiser -- that's why I'm here.


Why not tell me what the verification process is now? If these procedures aren't already "instituted" (shouldn't that be "implemented"?), how can anyone trust the doctors you already have?


I'll take a government-issued license, which in large parts of the world implies *some* level of actual training, over a review system run on a website that doesn't even give the names of the doctors.
For a company that believes in "openness" there is also little on CoinMD.org regarding a registered company name, location, jurisdiction, and any applicable regulation it complies with -- like, you know, patient-doctor confidentiality, which is a law in many parts of the world.
Not for the first time when it comes to a bitcoin "business", details that would make trust easier by demonstrating legitimacy are nowhere to be seen.

Yes. 
Firstly, VAT. 
As a buyer, you only pay this once: when you purchase something. The business selling you goods add the VAT to the price. It then passes it on to the government. (The business can also claim back from the government VAT it has paid on other business expenses.)
What makes it so tricky for a bitcoin exchange in the UK is that you must register for VAT when your annual turnover is more than £79,000. Which isn't very much for a currency exchange.
HMRC (the tax office) has declared that VAT is applicable to bitcoin. So, essentially, the government is asking for 20% of the price of every bitcoin sold. 
You can see how this makes it very hard for a UK exchange to be competitive. That VAT demand cuts seriously into margins.
Capital gains tax:
This is something you pay when you get rid of something, either by selling it or giving it away to somebody. You don't have to pay it on everything -- there are some exceptions. It's mostly associated with stocks and shares, and other investments.
You total up all the *profit* you have made on applicable assets, subtract your annual tax-free allowance (for this tax year, £10,900), and then pay capital gains tax on the rest. The rate varies -- it starts at about 18% -- because it's linked to all the other income that's taxable, such as your salary.
So, rough example: You buy £5,000 worth of bitcoin. The price increases to £20,000, and you decide to cash out and convert the bitcoin back to GBP. 
You've made £15,000 profit. The first £10,900 is all yours, but the rest, £15,000 - £10,900 = £4,100, is liable for capital gains tax.
If we take your 100% appreciation example, you wouldn't pay any capital gains tax on that £5,000 investment, because the total profit falls within the tax-free allowance.
Very rough examples (they assume no other income etc) and disclaimer  for anyone reading: I am not an accountant and this should not be taken as financial advice. Please consult a professional :)

While leaving the current banking system completely might be several step too far at the moment for most people, there are inititiatives that are trying to improve the way that current banking system works.
The [Move Your Money]( campaign in the UK had some success last year, and showed that many people were prepared to change their bank for principles.
Another UK initiative that has just launched, the [Current Account Switch Service]( is designed to make it very easy to move your current account from one bank to another. It's hoped that reducing friction will lead to customers being more willing to move their accounts (something they don't do very often in the UK). The plan is this will lead to competition, which will lead to banks improving the way they do business, and, ideally, help loosen the grip the Big Four have.
I don't disagree with anything you said. I just think it will be a while, perhaps a long while, before there's enough critical mass to scrap the sytem we have completely and use something like bitcoin on a wide scale. In the meantime, some people are trying to reform the system we are all so heavily invested in, and offer people more of the banking choice, even if only a tiny little bit more, that you're talking about.
Compared to "Invest some of your money in a nascent digital cryptocurrency that very few people have heard of and very few people use", something like "Would you like to be able to switch your bank account much more simply?" is an easier sell.

Stupid media promo photos and graphics appear in every field, of course, and scientific or technical ones are often the worst because the media outlet tries to put a human and / or physical, tangible image on something that isn't.
I just feel it's a giant step backwards, or sideways, at least, in trying to convey what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin isn't supposed to be "physical"; almost all of its benefits are because it is explicitly *not*. Making it seem like Bitcoins exist and you can hold them, no matter how well you describe the protocol in the text, sends a mixed message and confuses people.
The name doesn't help, of course. I once read somewhere on this subreddit that "Bitcoin" sounds like "it was named by an eight-year-old". There's a whole load of truth in that.

[After a certain number of consecutive contactless purchases you will get asked for your pin.](
If someone steals your card to go on a small items shopping binge, they won't be able to get very far. They'd have the time taken for them to reach that limit or for you to phone your bank and block the card -- whichever is shorter. (You could still of course dispute any purchases with your bank: as long as you "acted with reasonable care", you're not liable for any fraudulent purchases.)
This is a pretty neat system because it doesn't affect the actual cardholder that much. Every time you make a PIN purchase, you verify that you're the card owner, and your contactless counter is set to zero. Most people make a mixture of contactless and PIN purchases, so they will only rarely (never?) bump into a situation where they try to do a contactless purchase and are asked for their PIN.
I think -- I would like to think -- that the system also has some sort of clock built in. If you try to make lots of contactless purchases in a short period of time, a flag is raised and the terminal will ask for a PIN -- similar to how algorithms block cards for suspicious activity.

I wish people would stop splurting out this line.
Often there are PLENTY of reasons for large open source initiatives (such as Mozilla, Wikimedia) to remain hesitant accept bitcoin.
Many of these are to do with fiscal reporting responsibilities to maintain a charity organisation tax status, such as 501(c). I went over some of them in [these comments](
Yes, the technology and the implementation is sometimes not a huge problem -- although I often think people here underestimate how difficult it actually is for large organisations.

This is where clearer regulation could help. Were bitcoin recognised and declared a currency, it would make it easier for consumers to claim the rights they have for distance purchasing.
As it happens, I'm fairly sure these rights could be claimed in the EU anyway, even if the consumer did pay in bitcoin. (The EU already has several currencies, after all.) 
I don't know about the US, though. And, curiously, [BFL's FAQ page]( makes a point of stating: *"Bitcoins are accepted by a third party vendor that handles the exchange. All of our machines are sold for US Dollars."*

If you don't know "what that means to them", how can you say for sure you are *not* high risk? "High risk" is not an absolute: people have different risk thresholds. Yours may just be higher than theirs.


I think their risk system is automated, at least in part. Coinbase only has [a small support staff]( and is growing rapidly, clearly with some pain. It wouldn't be possible for them to ring every customer every time a risk was flagged.


Well, almost as common a denominator as the company is the manner the customers take. Here, you've accused them of "fucking you over", "fucking you out of money", and "running some bullshit". I understand you're frustrated, but do you really think that's a constructive way of approaching them after just one email? Is it going to make their no-doubt stressed and strained support team more amenable to fixing your issue? Manners cost nothing.
But mainly: this isn't the Coinbase support forum. You mention elsewhere in the thread that you've emailed them, but as it's out-of-hours you haven't heard back from them. Would it kill you to wait to see if you do get a reply before coming and moaning on here?
It wouldn't be so bad if we could keep all the "I was rejected" complaints to one thread. This would help the Coinbase support staff, too -- they'd only have one place to look. Even better, how about a dedicated subreddit! Like, oh, @_date: 2013-09-25 01:23:27

It's not worth it for Dropbox. The potential benefits aren't greater than the hassle.
In all likelihood Dropbox doesn't make as much money off personal users as it does off business plans.
Compared to the total market, the number of personal users who would pay with bitcoin is miniscule. The number of business users is tinier still, because accounting, reporting for tax audits etc etc. Why would a business choose bitcoin over a credit card or bank transfer system they've already got set up?
There's also the question of integration. Before somebody cries "They could just implement Bitpay!", they should ask somebody who has ever implemented a payment system for a company of this scale whether that's so straightforward. 
I have never worked on payment systems for a company, but the answer is: no, it isn't.
Then there's the question of Dropbox's possible IPO. Is offering a payment method that practically no-one will use worth it? How would it affect Dropbox's own financial reporting situation? What kind of media reaction would it receive?
@_date: 2013-08-14 21:23:08
Yes. Electrum can do this for you.
It's a deterministic wallet, which means it generates new addresses as you need them. Every time an address receives bitcoin, it creates another empty one for you to use. If you don't change the default, you will always have 5 fresh addresses to use. 
This is not just helpful for anonymity -- it helps you track payments more easily.
When you make a transaction, it sends any coins left over in one of your inputs back to what's called a change address. Again, it generates new change addresses for you automatically, so coins are always sent back to a fresh one.
Electrum is a great wallet, imo, but it could do with much better documentation. It's not difficult to use but the manual and help documentation, what there is of it, is a little all over the place.

You could use your blockchain.info wallet, yes. Very simple and straightforward. The downside is it's an online wallet -- it's not completely under your control. Like any online service involving money it is vulnerable to attack, and you're trusting blockchain.info to protect your money.
As for making a profit, well, replace "bitcoin" with your local currency and you have an answer. Mining is far from the only way to get bitcoin. Some people buy them for their local currency (be it USD, euro); others earn them (see others sell things for them (see Bitcoin in itself isn't a magic profit-making machine. There are some people who treat bitcoin like a stock or commodity, and invest or speculate in it in the hope or expectation of future gains. And there are others who treat it more like a currency, and use it to buy goods or services, or send to other people.

Why not just create a private address using an offline copy, of say, ~~brainwallet.com~~ [brainwallet.org]( and hide that somewhere that isn't so obvious, large and conspicuous?

As a counterpoint, I'd say there are limits to how useful it is as a means of exchange -- and these limits are what prevents Bitcoin from being the global everyday-currency panacea that some of the dreamers in this subreddit long for.
Bitcoin is fantastic for long distance remittance, for distance purchasing or selling. But for many small, quick, face-to-face exchanges, the requirement of (a) some kind of computer and (b) at some point, some kind internet access, not to mention a quirky denomination system, means it has some work to do. 
Let's say I want to buy a bottle of ginger beer from you. I'm thirsty, in a rush. What's easier -- handing you a coin or note for one unit (dollar, euro, astrolabecent, whatever), or getting out my carryaround computer thing -- if I've remembered it, if the battery's not dead -- launching some kind of app, inputting or selecting some kind of addresses, carrying out some kind of transaction, checking it went trhough okay.
Bitcoin's physical and mental hurdles are much bigger than simply putting a coin down on the counter.
Yes, mobile money and NFC payment have taken off in some countries. But in many others -- such as the UK -- where the infrastructure is set up, it hasn't at all. (My debit card has a contactless payment thing. I've never used it. I've never seen anyone use it.) 
And the fact we have mobile money and NFC means I think it's far more likely that we will see innovations in exchange utility within existing currency systems, rather than abandoning them for a completely new cryptocurrency.
As for your second point, about stateless backing: for me, this is a huge barrier to a widespread adoption of Bitcoin. This will turn off a lot of the anti-state, taxation-is-slavery brigade that pop up here from time to time (hi guys and gals!) but many people in the world are comfortable with the *idea* of a government, even if not the current version they've got, and are happy with the *idea* of taxes, even if there's something they don't like theirs being spent on. (There always is.) 
Comfort doesn't make for a good revolution. Until a government says, you can pay your taxes in Bitcoin, I can't see how Bitcoin will ever supplant an existing currency, or even coexist with it, in a *major* way. And I doubt that a government would say you can pay your taxes in Bitcoin, because they'd have little control over it. Look at how some countries in Europe are struggling with the centralised euro. (I'm not saying Bitcoin is the same, just that when financial decisions are taken from individual governments' hands, there's often trouble.) It would also require lots of countries to make the change at once -- I can't see how one country could have an explicitly deflationary currency that they didn't manage while most or all of the others had an inflationary one.

My assumption -- and I must stress it is that -- is that the mining problems need to be uniformly solvable. That is: the difficulty of the problem needs to be roughly regularly "predictable", for the competition to be be fair.
Even if you never win the lottery, you know that if you do play, you have a chance, however small.
In the fields you mention -- language, weather, seismic activity -- there are certainly things that could be discovered, analysed. But are there enough problems, each with a specific defined goal, for, on average, every 10 minutes, for more than a hundred years?
How would you come up with that many lotteries?

If that's true, then why is Singapore ranked 149 / 179 -- its lowest ever position, one place below Russia -- on Reporters Without Borders' 2013 Press Freedom Index?
(The Press Freedom Index covers both journalists and what RSF calls "netizens".)
Freedom House's 2013 "Freedom of the Press" report declared Singapore "Not Free". Singapore was ranked 153rd.
As for "without facing any backlash", bloggers that do criticize are targeted by the authorities. Several examples are highlighted in this Yahoo! News piece:
Websites that report regularly on Singapore issues and have a large reach also have to pay a "bond" to the government, and take down stories if the government disapproves. A large reach is defined as 50,000 unique visits a month; it's feasible that this would cover some bloggers or independent media in future:

For me, all those things *are* "out of topic". Downvotes allow me to provide feedback, express my opinion on what the community should be focusing on.

OK, that's one. "More businesses" implied it was happening all over the place. Any more? 
Also, from that link:


So Foodler avoided 2% or more of fees on less than 1% of its business. And you can't say it's 1% new business, because we don't know how many of those people who deposited Bitcoin were existing customers. Even if they are new customers, we don't know if they opened accounts purely because Bitcoin became an option -- they might have created accounts anyway.


Yes, but you must also take into account the cost of implementing Bitcoin into a company's payments system. This sounds like it wasn't much for Foodler because the firm is staffed with "software enthusiasts" and Bitcoin  fits the business model. And yes, it has led to a tiny increase in their margin.
But for some companies, implementing Bitcoin might not be so straightforward, will cost money, and provides no guarantee that the company will make enough profit from a Bitcoin-revenue stream to cover the cost.

I would remove the picture of physical Bitcoins. It's misleading and invites a false comparison with traditional money.

You're missing OP's point, I think -- they're saying that the current difficulty is a red flag to further widespread adoption of bitcoin.


Acquiring bitcoin *is* part of the system. There's no point bleating about great the party is to the people outside who can't get in.


Funny point about the beta -- I notice the sidebar no longer mentions how bitcoin is "an experiment", like it used to. Now bitcoin is "*the currency of the Internet*". 


"maybe you should read" -- that's pretty insulting. I think OP raises very valid concerns.
Besides, I live in Europe. I can transfer money from my bank account to another bank account, same bank or not, for nothing. Thanks to the [Faster Payments Service]( this can take at most a few hours, and is often instantaneous. 


For the credit card transaction fees, say, 1%, I get [a LOT of consumer protection]( none of which necessarily applies with bitcoin thanks to the sketchy nature of the services OP describes.

**Today's lesson: question statistics that are presented purely as percentages, proportions and ratios.**
"Triples" sounds dramatic. Click the link to read more. Find out it means increasing a share from "1% to nearly 3%" between June and July.
Well, how many global downloads were there in those two months? Why not tell us that, too? Is it 3% of a thousand or ten thousand?
Why no absolute figures?
It's possible that there were actually *fewer* absolute client downloads in Argentina in July than in June, but the *share* went up because there were fewer worldwide, too. 
Keep reading. See the second graph, showing Argentina having a positive "change in rate of download". That's a bit confusing. What does "rate of download" mean? Is that the increase in absolute numbers? If so, why aren't the absolute figures given?
Article diverts into currency issues in Argentina. Reach end. *Still* haven't got any absolute figures, or even a source for the figures the headline numbers are lead paragraphs were based on.
Instead, a very dubious scatter plot. But that's another story...
**edit**: after a bit of digging (digging I shouldn't have had to do) I think I have found the numbers. I am assuming they come from the Sourceforge stats page for the official Bitcoin client. If so, here are the download **counts**, rather than percentages, for the four months in the chart:
|:-----|----:|   
|April|5112|  
|May|1960|  
|June|1902|  
|July*|1497|  
*July's figures are until 2013-07-17. If the download rate were steady throughout the month -- and that is a big assumption to make -- July's figure would be around 2700 (1497/17 * 31).
For reference, the population of Argentina is 41.5 million, [according to WolframAlpha](

"The country" is not thinking about banning anything. 
A single politican out of 200 has suggested his country's cabinet look into bitcoin. 
Some -- though far from a majority -- other politicians agree that the cabinet should look into bitcoin.
~~Nowhere in his suggestion does the politician mention the word "ban"~~. The politican is not asking the cabinet to ban bitcoin. Only that the cabinet looks into what "measures" it *might* need to take, *if any*. 
Those measures -- if the cabinet decides it needs to take any -- might be similar to those taken in other countries: regulation and licensing systems bitcoin exchanges, or formal declarations of bitcoin as private money.

I took it to mean that the FCA declined to comment when asked for a line by the writer of the article, not that they declined to comment when approached by exchanges. In the preceding paragraphs, the Bitstamp chief exec says he has ongoing dialogue with the FCA, and another startup says they were responsive when approached with a business model.
The FCA might have declined to comment for any number of reasons. "Declined to comment" is often just journalistese for "I couldn't get a quote". If the writer rang up the FCA press dept and said, "I'm going to print in two minutes -- have you got anything to say about X, Y and Z?", it's highly likely they would decline, simply because they won't have enough time to come up with a statement that is both accurate and isn't going to cause trouble later down the road. (So much journalism is just twisting what some poor press office person has said or typed...) This is especially true when the topic is one where the organisation doesn't have a fixed decision yet -- like the article says. 
I'm not saying that's what has happened here, necessarily -- just that declining to comment on a news story doesn't mean the FCA is sitting around eating Milky Ways and playing Kandy Krush while Bitcoin startups are outside in the waiting room shuffling their business proposal papers and fidgeting in their seats.

Two thoughts: A lot of people don't use social media to create and consume viral content. They use it to keep in touch with friends and family. Catchup emails, baby photos etc. If everything is transaction-based, will they now have to "tip" each other to do that? It sounds unnatural. "Hi Mom, here's the latest photos of your granddaughter." "I can't see them." "No, you need to tip me first..."

Note how he's not saying the next step is becoming the currency of a country, only "potentially becoming". 
So the next step in Bitcoin's development is another hypothetical.
And, by saying this, he nudges the needle on that hypothetical one degree over from *Pfft! As If!* closer to *Well The Media Is Talking About It...* -- thus potentially smoothing the path a tiny bit for the ETF he wants to launch, which, according to people who know stuff about ETFs, currently has only a very slim chance of ever being traded.

You're welcome -- I'll admit that some of it came from the "devil's advocate" side of the top of my head :)
I understand the problem you're trying to address, and what your goals are. I suppose my ambivalence comes from the link between voting and money, and the behavioural economics that brings up.
What could achieve your goals in a different way is to leave voting as it is, whether reddit-style up and downvote or HN-style limited downvote, but more tightly integrate a bitcointip-style system. 
For example, a user or submission could have a list of charities they want any tips for their comment or submission to go to, and other users quickly easily choose to donate to one, all, or none. By quickly, I mean clicking and perhaps entering a pin code code, perhaps, rather than clogging threads with typed commands to a bot.
At the same time, users could donate each other directly. That way, you could reward somebody for their work without having to patronise a particular cause.
And by uncoupling voting and donating you would still be able to upvote and downvote on quality, rather than having to second-guess about agendas. 
So in short, it would be reddit or HN with a souped-up bitcointip system.

An exchange lets deposit one currency, and trade with other people using the exchange for other currencies. The price is determined by what those other people are prepared to pay.
With Coinbase, you buy bitcoin direct from the company, not from other people. The company has a certain amount of bitcoin to sell and the company decides the prices it will sell and buy at.
With an exchange, at any one time, you can have amounts in lots of different currencies in your account. For example, if you have a MtGox account, you could have both USD and bitcoin in it. 
You can't do this with your Coinbase account. You can't load it up with USD ready to buy when the price suits you.

Exactly. I express a personal opinion, and receive downvotes for it. In doing so I learn what the community broadly values and accepts, and what it doesn't. 
Like I said, I agree with your overall point, that trolls make you think. Also that there are different types of troll, and the examples you give of each. 
I just feel that calling people "psychiatric cases" based on their reddit comments is unnecessarily glib and a bit crass. 
In my opinion, the casual use of such language doesn't help or improve society's attitude towards people who do have psychiatric issues.
If the downvotes are anything to go by, I now know this community doesn't agree. That's the reddit voting system in action.

From an EU-consumer POV, the lack of consumer rights protection with Bitcoin (or at least the grey area) is a problem[1]. People moan about PayPal customer service, but that seems to be largely a US thing: in the EU they are incorporated as a bank, so both sellers and merchants are protected by EU consumer rights on things like distance selling, and the procedures for related scenarios are set up.
[1]I think if you bought something with Bitcoin in the EU you could argue you should still be protected by the same rights, and win, but you'd have a much harder time.

The answer to all of those questions is "No".
There's more to currencies than their inflation rates relative to each other. Even if, at the moment, bitcoin's value is going up, not down, it is not "performing far better" or "kicking ass" when it comes to everyday use -- you know, that thing most people in the world use currency for.

The more I hear about the idea of it being illegal to be homeless, the more the mind boggles...


First thing I would do is find out which codes are supposedly being violated. I'm not from Florida, but where I come from the police have to tell you which law you're supposedly breaking.
If you know exactly which code or codes, you will (a) be able to work within or around them better, and (b) know what to put in the official complaints you make to your local political representatives, ombudsmen etc. (Again, not from Florida.)
I'd also tell anyone who might get a blanket from them in future to make sure they get the full details of why (which codes etc) from the code enforcement officers. In writing if possible. I appreciate this might not be possible when it's cold and someone is on the streets and they're having their blanket taken -- they'll no doubt have other stuff on their minds -- but demanding official records of as many incidents as possible will be both evidence for your cause and might also create boring paperwork for the officials, slowing them down.
Contact the local media. From a cynical media point-of-view, there's a very easy human interest story to write or film here.
Do you know any local lawyers who might do a bit of pro-bono work? Like I said, I can't get my head round the idea of it being illegal to have bad luck and end up on the streets. Surely someone legal looking to make a name for themselves would take this on.

I think the difference between investing and speculating is you do the former in expecation and the latter in hope.
If I invest in something, I expect to make a return. I expect a return because the usefulness of what I'm investing in will repay the cost. 
The usefulness may be to me, or others. Think about how we say things like "I must invest in a new vacuum cleaner / set of windows / computer graphics card", as well as "He invested in Google or Tesla Motors".
If I speculate on something, I hope to make a return, but acknowledge the risk of a loss.
What they're saying is that, as they see it, bitcoin has no intrinsic value, so it does not have enough usefulness to repay any money put in to it. Which makes it a speculation rather than an investment.

The earliest mention of ersatz in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) comes from 1875, where it was used to refer to the German army replacement reserves.
Looking at the other OED entries over the years, it seems to have gradually attained the "inferior" slant as a result of ersatz products manufactured by Germany during the two World Wars: rubber, coffee, bread, benzene etc. English speakers came into contact with these products, and the words used to describe them, and borrowed the term. As they were exposed to it by products that generally were "not the real thing", that's the context that stuck. 
This is an entry from 1939, a magazine advert for tobacco:


In this instance, the term is still being used to refer to something physical. But by the 1952 entry, the abstract concept is attached:


Worth noting too that ersatz is now usually used as an adjective in English, not as a noun, as in German.

Here goes :)
A deterministic wallet is one where all the keypairs (ie., bitcoin addresses) are derived from a single seed value. 
This value might be a long string of numbers and letters, or it might be a passphrase. The wallet Electrum uses a 12-word passphrase.
As long as you remember the seed, you can gain access to all the addresses associated with it -- you don't need to remember the private key for each address.
A deterministic wallet will generate new addresses for you as you need them. They will all be generated from the same seed.
A BIP_0032 Hierarchical Wallet works along the same principles, but allows you to have different branches of addresses from the same seed. So, if you are, say, a store, you could have a wallet that has two branches -- one for receiving payments from customers and one for dealings with suppliers.
With a normal deterministic wallet, anyone with the seed can access all the addresses associated with it. But with a hierarchical one, you can decide that only part of the wallet -- one branch, for example -- is accessible. 
So in the example above, the customer branch can be separated from the supplier branch, even though they are generated from the same seed.
This has advantages when it comes to building payment systems.

What strikes me as odd about many paper wallet designs is all the unnecessary stuff on them. QR codes, little holograms, logos, even the word bitcoin.
All you need really is the private key, which is a string of letters and numbers. This can be turned into a series of words, which are easier to manage. You don't necessarily need to print these out using a printer you then destroy, on military-grade paper. You just need to make copies of those words, and keep a copy of the algorithm code that turns those words into a private key.^#
So one approach would be to create redundancy through placing those words in several locations using [steganography]( 
Now, of course, you want those words to last, in some way. Either you increase the number of hidden copies, increasing the chance one survives, or you make one copy as longlasting as possible. 
Even if it is a little more "in the open" than traditional steganographic methods, I can see the benefits here of metal etching. We can still read engravings from thousands of years ago; enough for more lifetimes than most of us need to concern ourselves with.
^#  If you use an open-source implementation, such as brainwallet.org, then you're already some way to making sure that at least one copy of the code will be around in future.

No, it doesn't mean that.
The 12-word seed is used to restore your wallet -- if your computer breaks, for example, or your hard-drive gets corrupted or so on. It means you don't have to worry about backing up your wallet.dat file. You launch a new install of Electrum, enter the 12-word seed, and away you go again.
For this reason, you should never share the 12 words, or enter them into a website.
Electrum will, however, also let you encrypt the local copy of the wallet, with a separate password, to protect against a scenario you describe: someone who got access to your computer would need that password to do anything with the wallet.

When you scrape off the "Bitcoin is freedom!" glaze this piece is coated in, you find very few actual numbers in it.


Any chance of an actual comparison, with some figures? Preferably with a comparison to the population as a whole? If one person wants Bitcoin, and then three people do, is that "rocketing" demand?


I'm always suspicious of figures that are simple percentages without the originals for context.
So I went to localbitcoins.com. I found this:
Buenos Aires: 
82.50 USD / BTC. So for there to be a 30% markup, they'd need to be selling at about 63.50 USD / BTC in Uruguay.
Here's localbitcoins again:
There's a difference in price, but it's nowhere near "between 30% and 40%".
Of course this is not a scientific analysis. But it's more rigorous than the original article, which is terrible.

1. Regulatory issues, from both tax and KYC (Know Your Customer) / AML (Anti-Money Laundering) perspectives
2. Bitcoin's volatility brings extra auditing work when it comes to preparing and reporting financials
3. Legwork required to integrate bitcoin into an existing system. For a big company, it's not simply a case of "use Bitpay!" There will be code security issues to reconcile, and also legal and contractual issues for using another third-party payment system.
On balance, the bitcoin market -- ie. potential customers -- is relatively tiny. Not many people use bitcoin and not everyone who does will use every company that offers it as a payment method. 
A big company might decide that in a simple cost benefit analysis, it's not worth their time -- at the moment -- to go through all of the above steps just for the sake of a few extra customers.

Yes, a private key dump would be enough.
However, if you are restoring the wallet within Electrum, the 12-word seed is much better, because it will mean that new addresses are generated for you in future as you need them.
Of course, if you wanted to recover the wallet's addresses into a different client, you could export your private keys from Electrum and then import them elsewhere.

Humans are notoriously bad at picking random things. If a brainwallet passphrase is not truly random then the security drops immensely.

Gray is making a larger point in the article about cyber- and techno-utopianism, the belief that technology, not political institutions (and therefore humans), will lead to a better world. (See also: [The Californian Ideology]( and the TV series [All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace]( 
Bitcoin is one manifestation of such ideas. 
The trouble is, according to Gray, that even though bitcoin users place faith in the laws of mathematics instead of politicians or bankers or "the vagaries of democracy", cyberspace is a human construct. And so is bitcoin. A human decided on a 21 million cap. A human decided on eight decimal places of division. A human decided that addresses should only contain certain letters. Any future changes to the protocol have to be agreed upon by humans.
As such, and despite what people say about it offering an escape from "thieving" banks and "oppressive" governments, bitcoin is not an escape from many of the same strains that have always existed in the relationships between humans, such as power, greed, inequality, poverty and violence.
As he says, *"A virtual currency can't escape the dangers of actual societies. Cyber money may have many practical uses and provide an alternative to banks. It can't be a way out from history's intractable dilemmas."*

I am really intrigued by Freicon's features. I love reading about Geseli and the theories and real-life experiments that inspired it. But I don't think these things  will necessarily translate to a cryptocurrency.
Freicoin has a chicken and egg problem: as a buyer, there's no point having any Freicoin if there's nowhere to spend it, because the longer you hold it, the less valuable it becomes. As a seller, there's little point in accepting Freicoin if no-one is using it. As soon as you take it from somebody, you'll have trouble spending it yourself or converting it into another currency you need.
In [the Wörgl Experiment]( Freigeld's success was down in part due to everyone using it, as decreed by the town's mayor. You obviously don't have a central authority with a cryptocurrency, so critical mass is harder to achieve. 
Freicoin could maybe work in a small local geographical area, or between several groups of people dispersed online who had mutually beneficial goods and services and needs, but even in these cases, it needs a certain *oomph!* to get going. A significant number of people have to really commit to it together; with bitcoin, a lot of the growth is down to people buying it just to see what happens.

When Coindesk (et al.) quote download figures, I really wish they'd provide a link to the Sourceforge page they're getting them from:
2013-07-01 to present  
  
Perhaps they don't provide a link because, well, you can make statistics say anything. Here are the figures for the first 6 months of 2013:
Germany downloads: 74,652  
UK downloads: 89,286
So, yes, the article is correct to say there were more downloads in the UK in the first half of this year.
But let's have a look at the downloads per day:
*H1 2013*  
Germany: 74,652 / 180 = **414.7**  
UK: 89,286 / 180 = 496.0
*H2 2013 (so far)*  
Germany: 19,286 / 88 = **218.7**  
UK: 16,826 / 88 = 191.2
According to the article's headline, there's been a "popularity boost" after "the government" (see other comments for explanations of why I've put that in quotation marks) declared it private money.
But the rate of downloads of the bitcoin user client in the first half of this year, before that supposed boosting announcement, was **almost twice** the rate after.
In other words, there's a whole load of selective statistic-reporting going on here. And it isn't the first time from this website or others.

You never said anything about the costs to someone else, or alternative methods of spending. You only talked about what was spent never benefitting anyone. Like I said, you made a blanket statement. 


No, I didn't. There you go again putting words in people's mouths. 
Sometimes public spending doesn't benefit me. I'm OK with that. Sometimes it is arguably harmful to me. That might be OK, too. Sometimes public spending might benefit others at my expense. I might be OK with that; I might not be.
I don't live under the illusion that the tax regime I live under is perfect. Nor do I believe that all public spending is good, or that public money is never wasted. Or that government always goes about taxing the public in an even-handed way. 
I acknowledge there are problems and issues. I have deep misgivings about many of them. But in spite of these, I also acknowledge there are benefits to a government + taxation system -- rather than painting the picture in a black and white, good and bad dichotomy. (The world doesn't work that way.) 
And despite the flaws in that system, and my misgivings, I'm not convinced that doing away with government and taxation completely would lead to an improved situation across the board.

Bitcoins don't actually exist, at least not in one place, so you can't "buy" them and "put them" anywhere. 
All that anyone buys and owns is the right to say that certain transactions in a public ledger benefit them. You assert that right through knowledge of the private keys that sign those transactions.

I wasn't asking for elaboration, necessarily -- just for you to call a spade a spade and not prefix a title with "PSA" when it is anything but.
Since you brought up conventions, can I bring up the following [rediquette]( 
1. Keep your submission titles factual and opinion free.
2. Look for the original source of content. *Is there any reason you didn't link to the stock's page on BTC-TC, rather than imgur? Seems like the actual page would be more useful than a screenshot.*
3. Post to the most appropriate community possible. Also, consider cross posting if the contents fits more communities. *Not saying you definitely shouldn't have posted it here, but are you aware of Might be a good crosspost.*

I think this a fair assessment. 
Quite often, though, it isn't bitcoin that is being criticised -- it's the hype surrounding it. This is then mistaken for being an attack on bitcoin itself.
Many of the stories that are submitted here are essentially vapid. At best they're endless rewrites of an announcement that is or isn't significant. At worst they misrepresent facts, mislead with statistics, and present wild extrapolations from few data points. 
These mistruths then get repeated and repeated. and then sometimes adopted as "canon" in the discussion. 
Things like: "One in three people in Kenya have a bitcoin wallet." "Downloads in Argentina tripled." "The German government says bitcoin is a currency."
When somebody questions such articles and the resulting discussion -- I myself do it quite often -- they're often downvoted or denounced for being negative or "off-message". 
But it is possible to be pro-bitcoin and critical of the way it is written about and discussed. 
is the most extreme example of this. He or she is actually pro-bitcoin, but dismayed at the culture of this community.
I don't agree at all with the tone takes, but I do find myself agreeing with the sentiment sometimes. I wish even the most ardent pro-bitcoin people were more willing to acknowledge, and then engage moderately and sensibly with legitimate criticism and debate of bitcoin hype, without feeling the need to lash out so often. It is possible to be on the same side and disagree.

I don't think this submission belongs here, because it is about general financial news. 
One of these types of articles -- "currency or financial policy somewhere in the world in trouble; somebody might do something different" -- appears in the media every day.
I don't think this has any greater or more special relevance to bitcoin than any of the other such articles. I've downvoted it for that reason -- but I'm not going to threaten to report it, like Reality4You did. 
I'm happy to let the community decide. If it wants to read and discuss general finance news every day, then, well, at least we know where we stand.

I know, but that is not what is being discussed. We're discussing how bitcoin's capabilities compare to existing features within the UK's banking setup. 
In this particular regard, bitcoin is often touted as a cheap and quick way of sending money abroad, from one person to another. Frankeh quoted the SEPA flat fee, and I quoted Transferwise, as competitive examples to the bitcoin method, which would require people on both ends changing their money into or out of bitcoin (either at an exchange, or through Localbitcoins or the like). 
In many situations, the SEPA and Transferwise timelines and costs compare favourably to those involving bitcoin. If you convert your bitcoin to local currency at an exchange you'll incur fees; if you convert it through Localbitcoins there will be a markup. Depending on the amounts involved, this may be more costly and troublesome than just using your bank. 
It's also worth mentioning that both SEPA and Transferwise transactions are guaranteed by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, which means if it goes wrong you have somewhere to go to get your money back ... unlike a BTC to BTC transaction.

In the UK, the basket is [public]( and goods are taken out and put in to reflect changes in consumer spending patterns. That methodology is public too.
Not saying CPI and RPI don't come without criticism, but the purpose in the UK isn't "to confuse people about inflation". If anything, it does the opposite: it highlights how inflation eats away at savings. Every month, when the CPI is released, it's a news bulletin item. It isn't swept under the carpet.

It isn't about a law against accepting bitcoin; it's laws about reporting to the tax man on where the money they receive comes from.
The WMF accept USD. But would they accept a substantial amount of USD from the leader of a drug cartel? Or from an organisation deemed by the US government to be a terrorist group? 
No, they wouldn't, because they are a 501(c) and rely on the good grace of the taxman for their charitable status. 
They have to be picky about who they get their money from. They have to be whiter than white, and they have to follow regulations to the letter. The problem is those regulations don't exist in enough detail for bitcoin yet.
We see a lot of people posting here that their banks have been giving them trouble for bitcoin-related transactions -- even one recently for using Coinbase, regarded as one of the most legit of companies. 
Can you not see then why the WMF might be hesitant?

QE started in March 2009. 
The USD-GBP rate at the end of Feb 2009 was 0.70. It's now 0.61. That's not an 80% fall.
The EUR-GBP rate at the end of Feb 2009 was 0.88. It's now 0.83. That's not an 80% fall.
Using ONS figures, cumulative inflation from Mar 2010 (i.e, the rate for the 12 mths after QE began) to March this year is:
(3.4 + 4 + 3.5 +2.8) = 13.7% for CPI    
(4.4 + 5.3 + 3.6 + 3.3) = 16.6% for RPI

Here's a bitcoin-related business idea for you:
Sell small rectangular pieces of metal (offcuts?) for people to punch their private keys on to for cold storage addresses. 
Aluminum? Would that be a good metal? You're the expert :)
You could perhaps design it a little: some kind of engraved border? a hinge that folds over on itself, so that when you open it the key is revealed? (Or maybe that runs the risk of fusing shut in storage... Again, you're the expert.)
If you could get a good trade deal on them, you could even sell a metal punch set with it, and make it a "cold storage kit". 
Of course, you're into extra overhead territory there. And those metal punch sets are pretty heavy (at least the one in my shed is) when it comes to postage and packaging. 
Much cheaper to send out a small sheet of metal. Especially if they were leftover bits that could be repurposed.

Theories include:
-- Bitcoin allows people in China to get round strict capital control rules that prevent people from moving money in and out of the country.
-- It is mainly investors speculating for a return, similar to a property boom or bubble.
-- Bitcoin is viewed as an alternative to gold as a long-term store of wealth. Despite short-term volatility, this is appealing because the Chinese government has a lot of control over how much the national currency is worth, and can devalue it almost at will.

Is this because you don't know how or you just can't access it? Only the source code for bitaddress.org and others, such as  are available online. It's stored on github. 
I've audited the code for brainwallet.org and I trust it. I can't see anything wrong with the random number generator and I can't find any connections to third party websites in the code. But don't take my word for it: I'm a stranger on the internet. If you can't audit the code because you don't know how, find someone you trust who is knowledgeable to have a look for you, if possible.


Neither of these websites (bitaddress, brainwallet) requires you to be online when you make the wallet. You can either visit the site, disconnect from the internet and then create the wallet; or you can download the site (via github) and run it locally in your browser.
Another thing to consider: these websites have real names and identities attached to them. It would be pretty silly for them to then build backdoors in the code to scam you out of coins.

**edit**: playing around with this feature, it seems this advice comes with a disclaimer: there's a limit of 100 addresses and 100 change addresses in the chain that it generates. For people with a long transaction history this is obviously of little use: it will only generate the private keys for some of the addresses in the wallet.

In her article she says the NSA stores even encrypted emails for 5 years on the off-chance tech will be developed to crack them. What's to say they wouldn't do the same for the Bitmessage blockchain?
They might not be able to crack them, but even if they stored and tried, the effect would still be chilling, wouldn't it?
Also, from the [Bitmessage Wiki front page](


In any case, this discussion does not belong here, imo. Bitmessage != Bitcoin. The community rules say, "Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere". I think Bitmessage is analogous to "some other cryptocurrency".

No, not really. If I know who I was giving my money to I would have some recourse. I would know who to pursue through the law if they stole from me.
Fortunately I live in a jurisdiction where online gambling is legal and regulated and I have much more protection. A fiat sportsbook that was properly licensed would not be able to run off with my money.
You call bitcoin the future of sports betting online. Deposits and withdrawals are certainly quicker, I will give you that. But I am not sure about the lack of KYC and AML, and that it's a bonus to accept customers from jurisdictions where online gambling is illegal. Unregulated, murky, unlicensed sportsbooks in Asia have been a blight on many professional sports in Europe because they have provided opportunities for spot- and match-fixing.

That's a textbook canned response. I bet "Venus S" didn't type any of it, except the name, and maybe the phrase "add an online currency". 
It's all copypasta from a bank of stock answers. Try replacing the phrase "add an online currency" with something else, like *"have a unicorn sliding down a rainbow as your background"*, or *"create an account for each of your pet stick insects"*. The rest of the email will still make sense.


It's designed to make you think it was "a nice response", partly -- like passing you over to a forum -- so you won't bother them again and clog up their email queues. They will have turnaround times to meet for each email. The quicker they can answer you and get you off their back, the quicker the queues are dealt with and the easier customer service reps meet their targets.

I meant the "feelgood" side of slacktivism. "I always upvote posts about protecting the environment and every time I do the charity gets $0.01. I'm making a difference!"
Another problem I can see revolves around the designated upvote causes. I might want to read an article that goes against something I believe in, and I might believe it was a good quality, worthwhile submission. But I don't want to upvote it because I don't want to give the designated charity my money.
Take your Voyager leaves Solar System example. I don't agree at all with the false dichotomy (SpaceX / Nasa), so I don't want to upvote or downvote. But I do think it's a worthwhile submission. So how do I have my say? I could leave a comment. But that's time-consuming and it will just clog up threads.
Somebody else might downvote purely because they want to give SpaceX money -- ignoring the quality of the submission and instead focusing on the causes.
Same goes for comments. Somebody might say something I completely disagree with, but was very well articulated and argued. Normally I have absolutely no problem upvoting stuff that I disagree with in such a case but when there's money involved I might think twice. I might not feel like rewarding somebody, for example, because I can see from their comment and submission history that they advocate and support for charities and causes I disagree with.
Multiply these kinds of feelings by hundreds and rather than improving the quality of discussion, what you might end up with is paralysis: nobody upvotes, nobody downvotes, because everything and everybody has an agenda.
Not all good, enlightening discussion has to have one. 
Also: In some of the best communities not everyone agrees on the same thing. So, suppose the community "collectively decides what is important", and I find that I don't agree with any of it. I leave. Eventually, the community becomes a group of likeminded individuals passing money around each other and to charities they all agree on. Next stage: groupthink.
In short, I'm just not convinced that injecting a monetary transaction^# into every aspect of news community discussion will necessarily lead to improved, involved debate, nor any activism that couldn't have been generated in other ways. I think there are more appropriate ways of supporting causes I believe in. 
Just because two things work well on their own, that doesn't mean they'll fit together. 
Peanut butter and jelly? Yes. Marmite and marmalade? No. But each half of those two combinations works well on its own.

True, but many crowdfunding exchanges work on the principle of taking the money when a deadline has expired and the target has been reached.
If that was the case, you could have a bitcoin (through Bitpay or something similar) payment option, where the exchange rate is set to be whatever it is at some point in the future. 
But that's not really a "bitcoin crowdfunding" site, more a crowdfunding site with bitcoin as a payment option.
Overall, though, I agree with you that the bigger issue is the potential market just isn't big enough.

Great, clear explanation on transactions returning true or false.


Since every bitcoin transaction is linked to every other bitcoin transaction via the blockchain, would this cause huge syncing problems if it happened on a wide scale? I presume clients would have to go back and unpick all kinds of valid/invalid knots until they found a clean, untangled thread.
Would that slow down confirmations? And could it lead to double-spend opportunities?

In every day speech, no, they often don't. 
But in terms of technical systems -- like, you know, *computers*, those things that bitcoin rely on -- they mean a hell of a lot, because they offer a standard way (the clue's in the name!) of referring to things. This makes it easier for different systems to talk to and understand each other.
Bitcoin is welcome to float free of such "moorings", but as it does, it will have to convince the makers every financial instrument, forex system, bank system, etc etc etc, to come up with a special code just for bitcoin, and then transmit that code to every other system it interacts with, without ever coming into conflict with the formats in other codes those systems already use. 
Formats like that specified in [ISO 4217]( which would indicate that "BTC" is a currency of Bhutan (prefix "BT"). 
The [Bhutanese ngultrum]( is subdivided into 100 chhertum. 
So under ISO 4217, which pretty much every existing financial instrument uses, BTC is already taken.

This gets asked quite often and every time I wonder why people can't just open a separate tab. 
Most chart / ticker websites will display and update the price in the page title, which appears in the tab, so it's not even if you have to switch tabs to get your latest price update.
Not to mention: which currency would you use for a ticker in the sidebar? which exchange price? which denomination of bitcoin, even (seems to be a hot topic lately)?
All we'd end up with is loads of threads complaining that X was picked instead of Y, or A instead of B, with comments claiming that everyone else is wrong and it should be Z instead.

True about still being able to take the names and addresses of donators.
But there is still a huge gray area in the US and elsewhere when it comes to legislation surrounding bitcoin. And this makes it much more difficult for charity organisations to comply to stay on the straight and narrow. If they have to follow regulations to the letter and those regulations don't exist, or exist only in patchy form, or are murky in any way, it's understandable that they are hesitant.
We've seen stories here of US banks making customers' lives difficult for bitcoin-related transactions -- even when these transactions are innocuous, and or deal with the more established, domestic companies like Coinbase. 
I don't blame any charity that decides bitcoin is not for them at this time.

Second one has no registered company name but after a bit of digging I found it its jurisdiction is Costa Rica.

Because they might not agree with the specification that bitcoin has? Such as a hard limit on the number of coins, or the exact figure of that hard limit?
I don't think it will be banks that do this necessarily. I can easier see somebody like Amazon experimenting with it: an AmazonCoin, that has a specification they decide upon, and which is redeemable on Amazon, perhaps with some kind of special benefit, at the same time as being tradeable for other currencies, including cryptocurrencies.
This sounds like an oddball thing for somebody like Amazon to do but it wouldn't be the first time they've thrown a curveball. People felt the same when they launched AWS; now it's a large part of the internet's infrastructure.
Maybe a payment provider like Visa or Mastercard would also get involved, with their wide network of locations that already accept their services.
I definitely agree that one side of the cryptocurrency coin is the decentralised blockchain. The other, though, is ease-of-use. As cynical as this sounds, I don't think many people really care if a central body is controlling their money, as long as they can use that money to get the things they need or want without a great deal of pain, now and in the future. 
To do that, the money needs to be relatively stable, not prone to wild inflation or deflation; and it needs to be accepted by people. 
When it comes to a cryptocurrency, you need to convince people to run miners and nodes and support the infrastructure. I don't think Amazon would have a problem convincing people there: you can get almost anything on Amazon.
Maybe AmazonCoin would launch and not find much success. Perhaps not as much as Visacoin, although more than WalCoin or PayPalCoin. But isn't that the Austrian Economist's dream? One of a marketplace of competing currencies?
Why stop at bitcoin? For all its power and success, it feels to me more like a vanguard than a new standard.

Please can you elaborate on this? I don't understand how an IP address makes it easier to trace people in transactions. An IP address is unique, but != a unique person. It's common for lots of people to share an IP address, and it's pretty easy to spoof or change. Given the other pseudonymous features baked into Bitcoin, how does this offer an advantage?

If you mean develop "apps" for Firefox OS, then there is absolutely nothing to stop them from doing this already. Although Mozilla offers a Marketplace, the FFOS app ecosystem is not closed like Google Play or iOS.


See previous.


I personally would rather Mozilla did not bake bitcoin support right into the OS, but rather made it easy for developers to add it as payment option. 
It should be possible to tack this on to Mozilla's web payment protocol, `navigator.mozPay()`, which already exists. See:
  
If you mean Mozilla itself paying developers in bitcoin, for working on the OS, it's worth noting this, from the Mozilla Foundation's "About" page:


Can any legal eagles chime in with what kind of fiduciary requirements California not-for-profits have, and how bitcoin might affect these? 
IANAL but I imagine being registered as a not-for-profit corp. means a certain amount of paperwork: accounts reporting and so on. Given bitcoin is nascent, volatile, and still in a bit of a grey area with regulators, that might be a stick in the spokes as far as accepting or distributing bitcoin is concerned.
**edit to add**: In fact, since FFOS is HTML, CSS + JS, I suppose all Mozilla would need to do is provide support for the [bitcoin URI scheme]( At the moment, if you open a bitcoin URI in Firefox on the desktop it prompts you to pick a program to associate it with. That could easily be extended to Firefox on a phone.

OP said: "Taxes are used *only* to fund wars and corrupt politicians."
I pointed out that taxes are also used for things such as building healthcare facilities, roads, libraries, sports facilities and playgrounds. 
How is that fundamentally wrong? Answer: **it's not**. Taxes *are* used for all those things.


No, I'm not at all. Don't twist my words in such a hyperbolic way. If the government takes my tax money and spends it on a life-saving operation for a child, or care for the elderly, something I agree with, that is far from your ludicrous, simplified analogy.


Repeating something again and again doesn't make you right
I have said only, correctly, that 1) OP's claims about what taxes are used for was wrong and 2) that even if someone steals from you, they could then spend the money on things that are beneficial for society as a whole.
At no point have I said that taxes are *not* theft. Maybe that's a nuance in the argument you can't see -- or don't want to.

Very disappointed to see such an esteemed financial news reporting outlet such as the WSJ put out such a thin story. Like the original Genesis Block story, this offers no source for the numbers.
What's more, like I [said]( on the original Genesis Block submission, reporting an increase in a share can be very misleading.
After a bit of digging I assume the numbers come from the [Sourceforge stats page]( for the official Bitcoin client.
Using **count**, rather than percentage, here are the figures for downloads in Argentina for the months in the Genesis Block graph:
|:-----|----:|   
|April|5112|  
|May|1960|  
|June|1902|  
|July*|1497|  
*July's figures are until 2013-07-17. If the download rate were steady throughout the month -- and that is a big assumption to make -- July's figure would be around 2700 (1497/17 * 31).
For reference, the population of Argentina is 41.5 million, [according to WolframAlpha](

It's very easy for somebody to point out how well they've done after the fact, drop six or seven figure sums into conversation, and then lean back in their chair and brag casually about having nice dinners with other people who did well. 
"I wrote an article about four investment grand slams ... and I'd recommended three of them!" True, but can we hear about all the other investments you recommended that weren't grand slams?


Knowledgeable maybe but I find it hard to take someone who ends fifty percent of their sentences with "Ka-boom!" and "Booooom" all that seriously. 
Finally, I took issue with the way he made it sound like Bitcoin's "wealth creation" was there for all. At one point he said that people who had invested 25,000 would be sitting on 10 million now. So easy! Well, of course -- if you happened to have 25,000 lying around you could afford to lose by speculating on a nascent, completely unregulated, extremely volatile, digital asset. 
The only people who do have that kind of money to throw around and can afford to lose it -- only risk what you can afford to lose, remember! -- are people who are already well off.

Yes. But we need to be careful about terminology here. You only have one Electrum wallet. Inside the wallet are several addresses.
~~Also, if you altered the default number of change addresses when you set Electrum up, you will need to remember what you changed it to. If you didn't change anything here, then don't worry.~~ See [LeoPanthera's clarification]( below.


Yes, it is local to the wallet on your computer. It's to prevent a situation where somebody who gets access to your machine removes the wallet file, imports it into their bitcoin client and swipes the money. Or, they get remote access to your PC, open Electrum and transfer the money to one of their own addresses.


No. Only the 12-word seed. It will use that to create a new wallet file, which you can then encrypt with another password.
I hope this clears things up. Any further questions, please ask. Electrum is a great wallet.

I think we've crossed wires a bit. I am simply pointing out that the OP is wrong to assert that taxes are only used to fund wars and corrupt politicians.
When I say "how is that fundamentally wrong?" I'm talking about the answer I gave -- that taxes are also spent on other things -- not the morals of taxation itself. 
And the answer I gave is itself not wrong. Taxes are not just used to fund wars and corrupt politicians.
Perhaps the word "fundamentally" has got me in trouble here. I'm actually not that interested in whether or not taxation is theft. I don't want to justify anything. I just wanted to point out that OP's statement was an exaggerated one, that failed to acknowledge the nuances in the arguments around nation states and taxation.
Yes, it's to do with semantics. But they are important, because without them these kind of discussions just lead to hyperbole and overgeneralisations, like ...


Well, yes, I can. My government spent tax money on healthcare which has benefitted me enormously. My life would be much, much worse without it. I also know a few people who would be dead without the healthcare the government has provided.
Now, maybe government spent too much on the healthcare, and yes, maybe somebody else other than government would have provided such affordable, easily-accessible, life-changing medical services. But that isn't the point you're making. You said I couldn't prove *anything* government had spent had benefitted *anyone*. I know a few people who are literally living proof. Before accusing me of "playing semantics", try examining your own blanket statements a little more closely.

I know deleting posts doesn't change the facts. It does stop others from seeing information that might be of use to them, though. Of course, it's BFL's forum, so I suppose they can delete posts. My earlier point was that if this ever did get to the point where somebody independent was looking at what happened, it would be very useful to have copies of all interaction between customer and company. In the same way you'd keep copies of emails, people should keep copies of forum posts and replies, too -- especially more so now there's evidence those interactions are at the mercy of a BFL mod's delete button.

For good and ill, I think sometimes Krugman has a different view of what his blog is than his readers (and critics). 
He seems to view it as a very personal sounding board, a place for half-baked thoughts, ideas, verbal diarrhea almost. 
It's like the vision of blogs that media people held right back when newspapers were first dabbling in "New Media". "Blogs are personal! They have a voice! Express yourself! First-person! Don't be afraid! Start a conversation! Quickly!"  
Somewhere, in short, that is very distinct from the op-ed pieces he writes for the NYT, which I'm sure he (at least) considers much more rigorous.
Most people don't make that distinction any more, though. "Blog" or not, Krugman is writing under a NYT masthead. He should probably be more circumspect with his words.

A quick glance at Rose's Wikipedia page suggests he does have business "experience": founded and invested several companies, made money, lost potential money, now a partner in Google Ventures.
You *could*, I suppose, argue about how much he has learned from that experience, but to say he has none "at all" is just being ignorant.
Also: it makes me chuckle how early bitcoin adopters often get praised as being ahead-of-the-curve visionaries, but as soon they decide to cash in, having made huge profits, they're derided as idiots.
Perhaps Kevin Rose considers he has made enough money in this risky, historically volatile investment, and would like to turn that wealth into something tangible -- something he can enjoy, or something that will bring joy to others?
What's wrong with that?

I don't think the Falciani - Snowden comparison is meant to make one the equal of the other -- more to say that they have similarities within the sphere they are operating. That is to say: both have leaked data. 
When sportswriters compare performances by a football team to a famous battle, or players to soldiers, they are not suggesting that a central defender or a midfielder's actions had consequences as great as an army general's. 
You see this kind of journalistic shorthand all the time. "The X of Y", where X is a current, topical or well-known personality or trend, and Y is a distinct field. Things like saying a city is "The Venice of Asia".
Often, like here, and as you say, the comparisons are misguided and not very useful. Snowden is topical, though, and the media likes to fit stories to current trends that resonate and are easy to identify with.

Your commodity-currency comparison ... I've never considered it from that angle before, but I am coming round to it.

A homeless person needing food doesn't employ more than a hundred staff, spending 11.5 million USD per year on salaries, whose positions could be compromised if he did not comply as strictly as possible and keep well in his own lane when it came to the financial regulations he operates under.

Given the attitude of many people who are into bitcoin towards regulation, my guess is yes, lots of sites have neglected their homework. Like a lot of internet entrepreneurs, they likely see laws as something to worry about if they get big and attract attention, and ignore until then.
I'm most surprised by the "Buy it with bitcoin!" sites, where they order stuff for you -- even things like hotel rooms and travel arrangements -- on sites that don't take bitcoin directly.
I'm in the EU, and it appears to me that there are likely loads of applicable laws there about distance selling, distribution, drop-shipping, insurance, returns, customer details, privacy, data retention and so on. And yet the websites for these services rarely mention any of that.

While it's a good approach, you run into problems when you're in a country where what you consider "an average, decent loaf of bread" is not widely available. Your idea of average and decent (a white flour, tin loaf, for example) might not be decent or average to someone else. You might be in a country where dark bread is the norm, for historical or cultural reasons. Not to mention bread is just not a staple foodstuff to many people in the world.

Please read my last paragraph again. In the parent comment evoorhees was comparing bitcoin to what he says are called "'real' currencies", ie fiat currencies. In general. 
I argue that since for most people in the world currency is used in everyday transactions, and that these are, in almost every situation in every place in the world, far harder or impossible to achieve with bitcoin, then it's a stretch too far to claim bitcoin is "kicking ass" or "performing far better" than fiat currencies.

They do in theory, but often it's just the same five or ten line blogspam article that doesn't add anything. It's one thing if the size of the outlet is significant and they are major publications -- if, say, Reuters or the NYT  picks it up and runs a short piece on it; it's another thing when it's Johnny No-Name and his "Bitcoin News &amp; Views" blog.
The answer I feel is that people check the front and new pages before they submit sttuff and be a bit more judicious. But like I said, it's mostly blogspam, so I doubt that will happen.

Privacy: anyone can look up your address and see how much bitcoin you have currently and have received in the past.
It's also much easier to figure out which transaction is which if you use separate addresses. Transactions "happening one at a time" doesn't scale very well. Suppose you know you're due to receive half a dozen payments quite close to each other. One of them doesn't arrive. The sender swears they sent it and it's delayed in the blockchain. You can see it is, but by the time it does arrive, you've received half a dozen more, and it's mixed up with them.
Much easier to track a payment and figure out what's been received and when if each transaction has its own address.

Yes, I think even with bitcoin you would still need a third party. Same as you would need one if people were dealing in coins and notes.
I remember reading / seeing a video where one of the bitcoin developers talked about how a transaction could have three parties, and at least two parties must agree for the transaction to be successful. 
It was more about escrow, but you could see how it could be used for a chargeback-like functionality.

Sometimes the innocuous comments are actually the ones that cause the damage.
In this case, I felt it was important to challenge because there is often an assumption that sudden good fortune has an underlying cause.
On the whole, we assume that if someone becomes wealthy, they deserve it in some way. We play up the hard work and effort somebody put into building their business, and disregard for example the fortunate economic climate they were operating in, or the fact their competitors made lots of decisions that turned out badly and left the field open.
Business leaders and tycoons write stories in this way: they started with nothing, and now they have everything, and it was all down to their "hard work" or "intelligence" or "foresight".
All that may be true -- sometimes. But that narrative now means that people look at the wealthy and work backwards all the time. They think: "Of course they're rich: they worked hard." Or: "Look how rich they are! They must be very intelligent."
This teleological view is patently false. Many people in the world are intelligent, or hardworking, or both, and not rich at all.
And I think it's a dangerous view to hold, because it assigns a position of superiority to the rich that they don't necessarily deserve. "He got rich. He must be smart. I'm not rich. I must not be as smart as him. He is better than me."
This is especially true in something like investing, where wealth can concentrate wealth. 
In this instance, I don't feel that OP's grandma's windfall -- as heartwarming as it is -- is, in itself, evidence of her being a smart investor, or savvy in any way. 
Bitcoin could, by its nature, bring us a new 1%. (Within the currency's userbase, it likely already has one.) Many of those will be people who invested in the currency's early days, or people who are rich enough now to take a punt on it. 
I'm always keen to guard against viewing such people -- the [survivors]( -- as automatically smarter or more deserving than others, just for having survived. Some will be; many won't.

was downvoted out of sight for suggesting this isn't as altruistic as it looks. I think he makes a good point. You cannot deny this is good publicity.
It is significant that "Martin Gale" felt he had to make this gushing announcement on reddit, and then donate here, rather than privately. 
It is also significant that he chose to include a link to his own gambling website -- including a referral code, presumably to let him track how much traffic this thread generates.
Publicity on reddit in front of at least 50,000 interested subscribers, which will lead to "news" stories on bitcoin-specific blogs, improving search engine rankings, and then might get picked up by more widestream media ... Even if the $7,200 worth of bitcoin was bought at market rate -- and it probably wasn't -- that's pretty good value in marketing-spend terms.
Of course the money is going to a good cause. But I won't be joining the rush to canonize OP for this action.

Risk isn't as much an issue as the cost-effectiveness of having to audit, and then code, Bitpay's API into their backend payment system.
Amazon isn't a mom-n-pop store selling a few products with a simple webpage. 
It's the most complex online sales site in the world. Incorporating Bitpay isn't a simple drag and drop thing for a company its size. 
Then there's the financial and legal obligations that using bitpay / bitcoin might provoke. All that will need to be analysed, and Amazon's tax setup and fiduciary responsibilities are no doubt complicated, like the backend code.
The cost of analysing all that, and then implementing bitpay (or a DIY bitcoin payments system) far, far outweighs the potential audience of people interested in using bitcoin as a payment method.

Great submission, OP. Although no doubt painful for you personally, it's refreshing to read something "real-world", something other than lines, axes and figures.
I agree that sudden swings in value aren't helpful. Just like they aren't for traditional government-issued currencies. I say currency here as though bitcoin definitely is one, but I'm still turning over in my mind what said in [this exchange]( that bitcoin is a commodity being hyped as a currency.
On the topic of other altcoins for currency, you have a bit of a chicken and egg problem there. People have to use them, and they are often much harder to get hold of than bitcoin, which, if the submissions here are anything to go by, is difficult to get hold of. 
The different features of altcoins fascinate me. I'm particularly intrigued by the Freicoin experiment and its demurrage, but that's a classic chicken-&amp;-egg case: there needs to be a critical mass of people willing to accept it before it can circulate, and without it circulating, we can't judge how effective it is.

Well, when you read the source -- which is Wikipedia, so, you know -- you get this:
