Sorry man, next time ask around first and never give away your personal information!

If you only have 800, don't put it into crypto.

I put in 100 on 11/29. Now worth 120!

Why are you a credible source?

If it had 1 bitcoin, that is worth almost $11,000. He gave you 1/5th of a bitcoin so like $2,200. You got scammed out of like 8-9 thousand dollars.

Why would you hold on past 100k?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:20:15
Keep it in your 401k
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:16:13
GG, you got scammed.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:12:10
What is it good for? What can you actually buy with it? The high price is all due to speculation, not any real world uses it seems 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:51:12
I don't think it will get to 100k

Nice so you lost $600 in one minute!
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:22:16
Just one month ago you were looking for an etherum mentor?
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:59:34
That's awesome, my girlfriend is almost done with nursing school and I just got into bitcoin today lol

Items would have to be constantly repriced due to the volatility of this market. Especially items worth hundreds or thousands of dollars
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:51:47
Too late to jump in at this price, but will when it drops near the 9k range which will be within a few days! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:53:08
The right one
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:52:32
Mobile working for me
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:55:36
Sweet! So it will be worth about 3k?
