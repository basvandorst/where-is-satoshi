Good for you, but that doesn't make the IP/patents/copyright legitimate. I'm sure some content creators enjoyed a great life in the XVIIIth century while being sustained by some enlightened King. That doesn't make monarchy or this type of content creator reward any legitimate either. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:15:10
IP, patents and copyright of digital content do not make any sense whatsoever, neither logically or morally. This has nothing to do with the fact that content creators should be rewarded for the benefit they create for society. We just haven't found a good system to support them fairly. I hope that blockchains and cryptocurrency will help somehow, but we have a long way to go.

Some ultra libertarians think that intellectual property is a form of immoral power over others. For instance you have made a movie, and suddenly that gives you some power over how the bites shall be distributed in my HD. If they align following something that you think resemble your intellectual property you suddenly have the right to descend upon my house with all your governmental violence and put me in jail. How dare you taking control over my property?/s

That would require the inputs and outputs of the contracts to be deterministic and accessible to the parasite contract. If I understood it right, most competent Ethereum developers claim that it is difficult/(impossible?) for smart contracts to access other contracts I/Os. Maybe you know more about this than they do?
Furthermore, I don't see why simple contracts with deterministic I/Os I couldn't use a simple public/private encryption of the I/Os to avoid parasites observations. 
Finally most interesting oracle usecases have M to N I/Os that may change with time, with most of the logic in "closed source" outside the blockchain (e.g. Relying on external automatized or manual inputs). Good luck building a trustworthy surrogate model of these. Even your use case is like that. Give me at a time t0 the probability of N events to occur. If I ask again at t1, I don't want to have the last answer, I want the new one. And I'm not going to trust a shitty parasite contract to have the latest information, how could I be sure it's not significantly different from what the real smart contract would output?
The use case I'm interested with is e.g. I run a weather forecasting model on a super computer and sell the API access through Ethereum. Users would have to pay a micropayment per (x,y,z,t) query. The result of the same query would change with time, as the simulations update. I'm looking forward to see what kind of surrogate model you will develop to compete with my simulations. Even if you had access, for free, to a record of all the previous simulation results that I sold, you wouldn't be able to reconstruct a surrogate model precise enough to predict a decent interpolation, which would be useless in that context as the users would most likely want an extrapolation of the previous outputs. 


So yeah, I don't claim to be an expert in smart contracts or in Ethereum, and I'm surely not the sharpest knife in the kitchen, but I'm not going around saying everybody else is embarrassingly stupid, either. 
That said I'm looking forward to see how Augur and Hivemind will perform in comparison, and how you plan to bootstrap your not-an-app-coin-token.

No, I'm not saying that, we are all different. But that doesn't matter. What I say is that a system where only a few unelected self made men decide is a very bad idea. It's very unstable, because you create a disconnect between the decision makers and the rest of the economy, that whether you like it or not have an opinion and will act accordingly. If you obviously use censure, hacking, snobbism as ways to try to mass control the opinion you are going to crash into a wall. This disconnect to assume that normal people don't have a say is absurd. If me as a normal person, I'm not convinced that Bitcoin has a useful short term and long term future I will vote with my money and sell all my Bitcoins. Hell I will probably buy another crypto I think have more future. Maybe I'm too dumb to understand it and it's a provable bad idea, but if I'm convinced I will still do it. So you see a winner-take-all meritocratic star system just creates instability and ends up starving it self. What we should do with Bitcoin is improving the communication between the developers and the community to establish trust. Votes or surveys are a good way to show that the voice of the people is being heard. Democracy doesn't really work like we think it does, but it works because we think it does. At the end of the day our voice is a tiny drop in an ocean of other people screaming for attention, but because we believe in the process we are more ready to accept the decisions. 


Yeah, well call me stupid or mad, but at this point I just don't want them to be in power. I have lost all trust in their leadership. They are welcome to send some pull requests, but I don't want them to be in control. We need a transparent democratic process in one way or another. We need open discussions, we need everybody who have something intelligent to say to be listen to instead of being censured. And we need a process to extract the signal from the noise of opinions. 


Yeah, I agree, that's exactly what happened here. Bitcoin was the revolution, what we got instead of a group of bankers was BlockCore and Theymos. Time to establish a real democratic governance for Bitcoin we believe in, or time to move to a better crypto. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:08:34
The contributors to core will hopefully follow the rest of the community, otherwise one can always cherry pick the commits to core on other forks. Hopefully not everyone feels like Mike H and want to give up. Collective decision is hard, especially when some people abuse their powers to direct or indirect censorship (e.g. DDOS attacks on forks, removing opinionated companies from official websites..). 
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:38:43
No I believe it. It's completely rational. Any system which is based on a star system ends up starving itself and is unsustainable. Only systems based on a rich powerful middle class is stable. Meritocracies are necessarily generating a winner-takes all star system. If you want the Bitcoin ecosystem to flourish you need to make it understandable to normal people. Otherwise it will never work. An elite system, where only the so-called self elected elite that censure anybody else because they are according to the elite too idiot to understand, will never work.

You misunderstood, the point isn't to make the idiot the equal of Einstein. The point is to make a system where Einstein has just a slight advantage compared to a normal man. We want to incentive work and extract the signal from the noise of opinions in decision making. But we don't want that only brilliant people decide. Because that gives way too much power to a tiny subset of population. This is the situation we have now in most countries, we have a tiny fraction of the population that have been very good a gaming their way up the reign of power, and amass huge amount of money. The 1% of the world have more money than the 99% combined. That's a sort of meritocracy. Even though most of us will disagree about on what values their merit has been measured, it what it is: a star system, a meritocracy. 
Coming back to Bitcoin, we just can't leave 5 guys decide the future of Bitcoin, even if they are very intelligent and knowledgeable about it. They would have just way too much power over crippling the Bitcoin protocol to push forwards their for profit technologies. Which is exactly what is happening. What we need in Bitcoin world is to make the tech understandable in one way or another for the majority of the population so that they can have enough trust in the system by themselves, and believe in the decisions that are taken by the smarter guys.

I find it fascinating that people still claim that Bitcoin is not a democracy and that Bitcoin users don't have a vote. It is by design a democratic tools. It is a democracy because anybody can fire up a node and vote with them on which rules we accept. It is a democracy because we entrust developers into designing a system that represents our beliefs of what we wish our crypto currency to achieve. It is a democracy because we can fork the code and fire the programmers if we don't trust them, or if they place their own interest above ours. It is a democracy because if all of this fail, we can still vote with our money by converting our bitcoins into another crypto currency we believe in. 
More than a problem of scaling or even governance, this whole crisis is a problem of trust. It's ironic that a supposedly trustless system ends up being shaken by a problem of trust in its programmers. Just like it's ironic that the community end up being censored to build a censorship resistant tool. Or that some people would claim that a decentralized payment system should only be designed in a centralized manner by a handful of self proclaimed geniuses regardless of the opinion of its users. 
Whether you like it or not Bitcoin is trustless, decentralized and democratic. That empowers its user with a choice, and therefore a voice. The only way you can move your agenda forwards is by influencing the users. You can try to manipulate them, spreading FUD, by censoring information; or you can try to educate them, by exposing them to as much convincing material as possible. The choice is yours. But denying the voice of bitcoin's users isn't going to help you in your quest.

That's the ideal case, when you don't have a small number of people with commercial interest that holds the private keys, use censorship and direct or indirect coercion to actively suppress the ideas that threatens their own company business model. If that's happening, then it is quite normal to fork. That's what open source is all about. This has happened numerous times before in similar circumstances (e.g. Nodejs/iojs, Open Office/Libre office).

It could be a scam, or it could be legit. But you don't seem to have any concrete evidence to back your prejudice. So maybe you should be a bit more relax about this. There aren't many companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem, no need to spread unnecessary FUD on startups that try to increase Bitcoin usage. Toxic behaviors are hurting us as a community.

Yes, the sooner the large Bitcoin wallets are redistributed, the faster bitcoin can become a worldwide currency. Having those few people waiting to cash out their 100,000s BTC is the real risk of bitcoin.

If you think its exciting the prospect of only making 1 transaction on the Bitcoin network per year and relying the rest of the time on centralized permissioned system, it sounds like you don't really believe in Bitcoin at all. 
@_date: 2016-02-04 16:10:41


But I'm not exaggerating. If you wish 100M people to be able to make any transaction on the Bitcoin ledger, so it could be for instance opening or closing a lightning connection, or settling an account from a centralized system, they can only do one action per year.

Funny that's exactly why some people support Bitcoin classic. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 13:04:25


Honestly these are very weak arguments. Rootstock would be unproven and most likely less secure than Ethereum at the beginning for executing the smart contract side. On the crypto-currency side it could be exactly the same 2-way pegg mechanism, so the second argument is irrelevant. 
I get it that the Bitcoin maximalists see Ethereum as a threat to their investments. But sometimes it's smarter to let the cognitive dissonance on the side, stop the train and try to think as rationally as possible. The crisis that is shaking Bitcoin should be an indication for everyone that Bitcoin isn't such a sure investment after all. If we have so much trouble deciding how to scale the Bitcoin protocol, maybe it's an indicator that Bitcoin won't be able to adapt fast enough to all the decentralized technological developments happening on the side. The only valid argument for Bitcoin maximalists is that whatever better development happening in other alt-coin could be implemented in Bitcoin. While it might be true in theory, the practice shows us how slow the development process of Bitcoin is really. If it's too hard or impossible to fork the Bitcoin code to extend it how you need it, it's easier to fork it by exchanging crypto currency. Sometime changing your country politics is pointless when it's a dictatorship. It's much more effective to just move to another more progressive city/state/country.

Censorship is everywhere on bitcoin.org or on Bitcoin core git. All ideas against cores are censored heavily. There is no actual proof that Blockstream is responsible, but it seems oddly convenient for them. 


Remember the DDOS attacks on Bitcoin XT nodes? Or even removing Coinbase from Bitcoin.org for even daring mentioning their support of  XT? Or the threat of changing the mining algorithm if the minors support classic? That's not enough proof of coercion against alternative ideas?


Blockstream has just raised some money. Now they need to show a growth to please their VCs. Their growth is directly linked with their prospects to move transactions off chains on privately owned for-profit sidechains. They can't do that as long as companies are happy accepting 0-conf, and that there isn't any transaction delays, or high fees on the Bitcoin network. If you look at RBF and their reasoning behind their opposition to raise the block size, it's pretty clear, I would say. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:41:09
You do realize that at this rate 250,000tx/day we can only have 1/4M people make 1 transaction per day. If we hope to have a 10 fold increase, 2.5M people using bitcoins will only be able to make 1 transaction per week. 10M, one per month. 100M, around one per year. Even with lighting networks and segregated witness Bitcoin won't be able to scale if we can't increase the block size. There is nothing to be excited about, you should be concerned about the incapacity of the Bitcoin community to move forwards. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:01:46
What's the point of not making an hardfork again in the first place? If there is an ongoing a seg2x hardfork anyway, the security narrative of not hardforking because of the risk of splitting the chain goes away. So why not hardforking on both sides?

@_date: 2017-10-28 23:22:09
But the argument against increasing the block size has always been to avoid doing a contentious hard fork. Now that we will have one anyway, why not trying to reduce its contention by joining the miner consensus? Wouldn’t that be better for everyone?

No because it would basically be a locked BTC transaction that would be activated by an Ethereum smart contract.

But still the point is the market is extremely thin.

I was thinking more about extending Ethereum go client to allow dual mining with Bitcoin.  That would allow double pegg with ether, and then planning a hard fork in a few years to switch to an ASIC resistant PoW, on chain scaling through Ethereum PoS / sharding, turing complete smart contract scripting for Bitcoin.... Oh and we would get ride of Blockstream and the "single client to rule them all" mentality.

The sad truth is that as the price of bitcoin increases, this gives more incentive to miners to burn more ASICS chips power. At some point the total bitcoin network might consume a significant fraction of the earth available energy. It just won't scale up.

I'd argue that fast &amp;amp; low transactions/ settlement fees are also a raison d'être of a crypto-currency. Don't you think?


I used to think that as well, but look at the elephant in the room. Bitcoin is way too slow to adapt itself to innovation. It's nearly a textbook example of how a complacent mega-corporation can be disrupted by a new more agile technology. To satisfy this narrative, bitcoins need to be able to change itself very fast, which is painfully not the case.

90% of start-ups go bust. While would it be different with ICOs? I don't see why most ICO companies folding would be any reason to panic. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:00:55
You assume that the ICOs will fail based on which insights? ICO investors know full well how risky their investment is, they are battle tested crypto investors. Even if 90% of the ICOs are failing, which would mimick quite well the normal rate of startup failures that won't invalidate the ICO assumptions.

OK, I'll bite. What use case is there currently appart for speculative trading?
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:53:31


This a good assumption that unfortunately remain to be proven. Right now it's not possible. So therefore bitcoin is not currently offering the required functionality for a cryptocurrency. For a speculative investment, maybe. For a stable store of value definitely not. I'm not sure what else it's useful for currently. Last year it was actually useful for transferring funds abroad and to top-up a bitcoin debit card. I would even order food or buy for a beer once in a while. Now it has become too expensive for all these usecases. 
No technology can survive if it can't satisfy the needs of its users.

Nope, it only works one way BTC-&gt;ETH. The other way would require Bitcoin core to implement some additional features. To let Ethereum smart contracts activate BYC transactions.
