There's a single index fund in my shit fidelity 401k that I go 100% on.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:39:33
I fucking hate fidelity. Their fees in my companies 401k are fucking garbage. Vanguard meanwhile has the best index funds.

It will go up or down, but it won't stay stable.

How can I be notified of the dip? I don't sit some l around clicking refresh all day. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:03:42
Then they're engineers. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:23:23
How can I be notified of a dip? And where can I buy it right away?  Coin base makes you wait like an entire week. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:26:38
How did you get it stolen? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:19:13
How can I be notified of a dip?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:08:12
What's the limit? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:33:47
How can I know when the drop happens? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:02:41
Any precedent of other cryptos getting pumped when bitcoin corrects?
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:07:50
Why? Why is it like this?

Buffet is a big advocate of the middle class that's why he champions index funds instead of dumb ass mutual funds.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:08:30
How long does the price correction usually take to hot bottom? A full day?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:42:14
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:01:03
What dip?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:04:50
I want to log in and buy when it falls
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:09:43
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:46:21
Then go to r/bitcoinmemes
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:11:12
Is there an alternative? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:54:52
Why put it on a hardware wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:03:21
MEMES ARE PRE-CANNED JOKES FOR UNFUNNY SHMUCKS
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:33:09
How did it pay off exactly? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:36:18
Can you buy through it using USD? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:55:15
The meme is stale
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:50:21
Memes need to be banned fun this sub this shit is not a fucking joke
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:01:37
How do I know this isn't just confirmation bias? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:05:48
@_date: 2019-05-30 07:59:32
Wow that's really gonna suck when they can't sell it.
