If you choose not to share your personal info then you just open yourself up for Dark Web fraud. Best to go legit and purchase with Coinbase then transfer to cold storage. It is the most secure. Keep your amounts under 5000 for your first coins. You can trade them on their exchange and even use a Bitcoin debit card. Except that the real world application of the currency has arrived, if your looking for a dark web crypto Bitcoin is not your coin.

I have been using Coinbase to store my Bitcoins for sometime now, BEFORE Ether was available on the platform. I have noticed Coinbase offers a higher valuation for Bitcoins as compared to other exchanges. Next, I have an idea that if there is a change over to Bitcoin Unlimited Coinbase will auto convert your coins, without you taking on the technical difficulties of doing it yourself.

It's my home state of California. The tech state is ahead of the curve when it comes to new tech. But in this case it's more than likely of the IRS interest in a 5 billion dollar company called Coinbase headquartered in San Francisco. This case is not only speeding up the legitimacy of Bitcoin it presents challenges for crypto currency as a whole.

Although you rank high on the COOL factor you are violating many simple security protocols.
1. Never have your private key assessable to anyone
2. Have a backup to your backup
3. Remember rule number one
Good Luck.

Just a bit of background, I have been involved in crypto for years as a active observer and witter of crypto topics. I had a fear like many getting involved in the very early years. It seemed very complicated and a lot of opportunities for fraud. Coinbase was the solution to that, at least for me. Very simple to attach to your account with strong security protocols. You can conduct a transfer each month in any amount from your phone with NO Transaction fee. The fees only apply if you sell your coins so its it a great place for collectors. You have a USD wallet and a Bitcoin storage wallet option. There is even a debit card available to connect to your bitcoin account. An extra bonus is you can now invest in Ether; I purchased at 7 dollars not its about 17 dollars. Let me know if you have other questions.

Simple Logic: Wall Street money moves in, hopes to record gains upon SEC approval. If no approval Wall Street revenue will be retracted. Price of Bitcoin will decline as a result.

Counter recommendation is welcomed this is a open forum. You have to understand we are assuming the individual has no background at all in storage and or mining techniques. Waiting to get involved at this point is harmful to the inexperienced (due to the fast rising price)

There can be an argument for both:
1. Leaving coins in a exchange i.e Coinbase keeps all his Bitcoins liquid. This means at any moment Bitcoins can be converted to cash. Be aware the user is NEW to Bitcoin I assume the user is not living off Bitcoin he/she is living off CASH.
2. First rule of investing "Cash is King".
3. My proposal was a hybrid method that included cold storage. Remember once coins are in cold storage it becomes a bit more difficult to exchange at "fair market value" if you need immediate access due to life emergency etc. this is why I proposed leaving a few coins in Coinbase for liquidity purposes.

As said by a close Bitcoin trader, "Its the Chinese" and this tweet confirms this, China is the largest Bitcoin mining conglomerate. They are looking to control something that can't be controlled. If a company or a entity connected to Bitcoin which is also connected to the Chinese Government its here where we will have a major problem. Fundamentally ending the bleeding of China's cash reserves; by destroying Bitcoin!

First: NO NEED TO PANIC. The decision to create an ETF was done by Wall Street to implement a plan for the takeover of the Crypto Currency Sector. It would mean that the projected life of a STABLE crypto currency could not exist under the implementation of an SEC backed ETF. 
Second: This ensures a more organic growth pattern like we have been seeing in the Bitcoin; ensuring exponential growth and our pocket fuller ($$$) than they are already. Bitcoin has larger issues than a ETF; this issue deals with the 1MB increase to the blockchain. 
Beware of those who seek to destroy something which is perfectly fine the way it is.

There has been for a long time high speed trading, Coinbase has a platform that shows trades that occur in milliseconds. This more than likely is NOT the case as of why the sudden decline but a interesting side note.

Personally I feel... the SEC's lack of approval will bring more stability to Bitcoin's established upward price movement. Upvote if you agree?

Looking at the advice, you should take your time in general you do have a secure holding company with Coinbase. Great way to buy your Bitcoins next is securing them. Take your time don't rush into any crazy storage systems without doing DETAILED homework. Always leave your Coinbase account with a few coins in there.
@_date: 2016-11-15 03:29:17
This is only an issue due to massive amount of "Zombie Coins" that are dormant in a wallet somewhere; clearly the governments claim of millions of coins from dark web raid is not helping this issue at all. No there will not be a coin shortage Bitcoin is the platinum of crypto the future contains a world of many currencies not just Bitcoin. So I vote NO!

The manipulation continues although courts are now increasingly involved, I suspect that the Americans who have manipulated Bitcoin Futures have moved outside the country to avoid regulators.

This is an interesting perspective, I have reason to believe that the compounding interest on the debt would cancel out any "inflation" correction, which could possibly reduce the debt. But, I do agree with your idea; I would propose that the majority of US debt is owned to the FED. As for the FED it will continue to print money in the interest of the United States keeping things "normalized".

I assume your assumption �� is correct that Bitcoin will not be widely used as a currency ��. The commercial development from companies such as IBM and others on blockchain tech like the famed Hyperledger will prove once again that cryptocurrency is more than just a currency. It's wrong to assume that if we with simple intelligence don't understand a concept; that in fact that concept is wrong. This would be a wrongful placement of judgment.
To disregard Bitcoin as flawed would in fact nullify our attempt at being aware giving credence to the inaccuracies of our own logic.

Compared to other exchanges the liquidity is in Coinbase other exchanges can't stand behind a higher valuation. I have witnessed the price swing to the low side and Coinbase was posting a higher price. Simply put they understand the demand of Crypto currency and offer a premium to offset their fees.
