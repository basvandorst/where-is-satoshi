Bad link, but I'm going to Google it. Thanks!

Since I'm getting downvoted, I'll clarify - I know my friends and my friends know me. We're friends. As such, we can recognize each other's intentions. I wouldn't do this for an office party. I'm talking about people that really know each other.

Sorry, Big Lebowski reference.

Well, that's just, like, your opinion, man.

Thanks for your replies. I didn't get any notification (hence my late response). 
Yeah, I kind of look at it like stock. If someone gave me a small share of stock I wouldn't think they were selfish. I'd be intrigued. I think if you explain it to people that way then if they are in any way upset about receiving bitcoin then they're fundamentally retarded. My friends are not fundamentally retarded so I have no worries. :)

But, yeah, I'm not worried about it coming across as selfish. I understand how it could, but I think that really depends on the audience you're working with. Thanks, though.

I'm not worried about that. It's friends and family. They're already aware of any tackiness I may have.

A paper wallet might be perfect. Thanks.

Right? That was my thought. There's no telling where the value could go. And, as a bonus, I might get someone new into bitcoin.

Yeah, I'm pretty confused about this post too. I opened up the app just to see if something had changed. Nope. Still incredibly simple to copy your address.
