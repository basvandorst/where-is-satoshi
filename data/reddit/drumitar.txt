A lot of people backing PayPal here but they don’t realize they could be next for any reason PayPal so chooses 
@_date: 2018-09-22 21:43:20
people side with paypal because they can choose who they do business with, cake store has no choice who they deal with. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:52:04
So you can deny some one PayPal but if they want a gay cake you gotta do it for the customer .

What about China though don’t they have a shit load of bitcoin and often influence the price with their propaganda ?

Its not just bitcoin but more
Social media of all these stupid boycotts of everything and anything under the sun. It’s great people have the right to chose but stop wasting your time trying to influence others
