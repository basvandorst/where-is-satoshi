What part of “I doubt” makes you so sure he expressed sureness?
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:28:53
No shit. No one is talking about the tech or stock’s function.
Someone said “something could happen and your investment can go to zero”. 
And I replied “that’s also true for stocks. That’s why you diversify”. 
No one is arguing about stocks being same/different than crypto in what they actually ARE. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:07:26
This is no different than stocks. Everything you said is true for dozens or hundreds of companies. 
If you don’t diversify, you’re a moron.

Imagine you were witnessing a once-in-an-ever event where a new financial world market was being born. 
Now imagine you can invest in that new market.
Now imagine you have a finite amount to invest. 
A reasonable person still might choose “all of their immediately liquid investable assets” as an option for getting in if their expectation is that they can beat a stock portfolio’s performance over the medium term. 
Which would leave them with “no” available cash they would/should spend left to invest. 
Doesn’t mean they’ve sold their cat to get in crypto.   Just means they’re making the choice to be in crypto to the best of their current ability. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:29:40
Exactly.

By definition, being a hodler does get you some very, very sweet gains without the daily agony of trying to predict the immediate future. 
I’m not sure I’d call that ‘smart’, but I certainly wouldn’t call other strategies ‘smarter.’

You would have a hard time significantly moving the price with $10M. 
So by my math, not a whale. A whale can affect the market and begins trading with that ability at the forefront.

Unless he's forseeing a drop

The number of people extrapolating BTC's growth into perpetuity is too damn high. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:11:00
Naked 2x ETH shorts are gold I tell you. GOLD

Lol. 
So, become a virtual being with no need for a roof and no physical assets? 
Dude needs to live somewhere. If he's smart he's going to buy the worst house on the best street and that house will also be an asset for him long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:54:37
I'm not following the reasoning here
Wouldn't he pay more tax on salary than long term cap gains?
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:10:56
I actually upvoted him it was so majestic.

And the internet to access your bitcoin...

Bitcoin doesn't need to do everything better than every currency. Just one or two things better and it will have a place in the economy. 
At the larger scale, there is very little difference between a currency and a commodity. We trade pork bellys futures and pesos, at the large dollar scale, to preserve, move, and protect capital. Not because we want to own pork or plan on going to Mexico. 
Bitcoin works very, very well in that same regard. It's easy to move lots of dollars in and out. It's global. Compared to an asset backed by a non-durable good or a fiat currency, it's has a lot of advantages. 
So far, it's shit for small dollar transactions. Today, Joe Schmoe's trip to the store isn't better with bitcoin. However, even if it was, he'd be stupid to spend a rapidly appreciating asset like bitcoin over a slowly appreciating asset like the dollar.
Bitcoin may eventually do that, but it's not necessary for bitcoin to be hugely valuable to the economy.  
Currently, it's e-gold, not the new dollar. Maybe it will be the new dollar too someday, that'd be great. But it's not necessary. 
As virtual gold, bitcoin still has 100x or more appreciation left in it. Easily. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:59:43
No. 
There are still lots of people on Reddit who think Bitcoin is a joke/scam. 
The world needs to know that it's real. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:19:47
And mining gold is environmentally friendly?
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:48:48
But within the countries are provinces, states, and regions that are not the same...
You’re racist for assuming info about an entire country is worth knowing. 
I say focus on the subgroups, not the countries.

“American school kids are protesting gun laws today”
u/videobrunch - WHOA WHOA WHOA. AMERICA IS A BIG PLACE! NOT ALL KIDS ARE DOING ANY ONE THING. 
Not useful. You’re not enlightening anyone. We all know Africa is a large, diverse place. No one read this as “everyone in Africa is now doing the same exact thing at this very moment.”
It’s still valuable to say “a lot more people in this big large place are doing something than you might think”. That’s the message. No need to fail at being a pedant if you’re going to be a pedant.

There is a giant PR push happening behind BTC right now. Lots of big names chiming in.

"Passing judgement" doesn't mean "passing on the investment opportunity." 
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:55:20
Yes. He doesn't invest in things he doesn't understand. That's smart. 
But passing judgement on something you don't understand is foolish regardless of who you are.

Word on the street is that they got a 25,000% return for their investors last year. 
Which is up there with the best annual investor returns ever. 
All due to crypto. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:01:56
He's saying $20k would be 5%

Arbitrage is what you're describing. It's mostly automated now (in currency).

This is the secret to finance. No one knows.
