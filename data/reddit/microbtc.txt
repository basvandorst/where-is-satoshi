@_date: 2014-03-26 21:09:09
Ah yes, tnx to blockchain.info for letting people know about this. We all need to understand that this was not theirs fault in any way !

He is not kidding , i just lost ALL my money, i had it all on that 1  address . Made on that site ! They had to be storing the private keys.

WOW i just got mail from them that they will REFUND addresses that are made since 31 dec 2013 . I don't believe it but wow, lets see. Oh wait do they think they will refund only what we paid for address to be made ??? Or what we are stolen.

I don't think its hackers, coz i did not get hacked, only affected addy in walet is that vanity addy. Sad part is that i had almost all my btc on it :( . 0.4 just gone , took me 2 months to make that . Its crazy . U rely can't thrust nobody in bitcoin world.

There is no chance in hell i will make another vanity addy again ! 
If anybody cares this is my donation addy , when that reaches 0.55 btc i am back where i started. I hope someone can help. 1GyDQ3npFsa72Ute6bXm3wen7U1GEFfpF4

This one used split key also. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:07:12
Yes, that is correct. They scammed us like that . 
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:26:03
I still don't believe this , i was thinking i know something about bitcoin , WHAT A NOOB! I lost 0.4 btc that i was saving up for 2 months to pay fcn scholarship and now i am fu*ed !
If anybody got scammed and knows how it feels, here is my addy 1GyDQ3npFsa72Ute6bXm3wen7U1GEFfpF4 , i don't think anybody will give a fuck but that's it, i am now done with bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:58:03
Yes, and that is my point why i am done with btc, nobody cares, and should not care . Its ours fault . U cant thrust nobody in this world . 
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:59:29
THAT IS SUCH A BS. Even if they are hacked they shouldn't STORE ours private keys ! Its theirs fault, and ofc ours to thrust that fuckers ! 
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:28:02
They probably made that in real generator. Not on this fcn scam site .
@_date: 2014-03-26 21:14:45
Not offending at all ! U are totally right ! STUPID and naive is the words ! 
But tell me something doest that mean we can't thurst this site eather ? 
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:16:43
No i did not use bitaddress.org , i calculated my key on that scam site. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:53:37
No , mine addy is old, have loads of transactions it was my main addy :( . 
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:26:11
Exactly i got stolen money only from that vanity address , and we calculate keys on theirs site . And they provide both parts so THEY DID HAVE OURS KEYS !
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:24:24
I guess i was rely stupid . Stored all my coins on that one addy so i can access it easy from anywhere. 0.4 btc i earned for 2 months. But well it was very expensive lesson but rely good one.
