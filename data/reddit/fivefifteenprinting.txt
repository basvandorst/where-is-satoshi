Thank you for the feedback!
I'm working on this right now. For some reason bacon reader doesn't detect the mobile CSS code so I'm trying to find a workaround.

Sorry about that! What browser and screen resolution are you using? I'll get that fixed asap! Thanks for letting me know!
If were to get 3 XL polo shirts with a 4 color logo on the chest they would be $12.75 per shirt with a $60 setup fee and a $30 small order fee. Also shipping would probably be around $6 to ship 3 shirts depending on where you are located.
Thank you!

Our pricing varies on a few different things:
1. Color of shirts (Black and colored shirts are more expensive than white shirts).
1. Number of colors in the design (A 4 color design costs more than a 1 color).
1. Number of prints (A front &amp; back print is more expensive than just a front print).
1. Number of shirts (You get bigger discounts with the more shirts you order).
And yes! We do names and numbers on the back. Names add $5.00 to the setup fee per name, and numbers add $2.50 per shirt.
If you were to get 25 jerseys like [these]( with a 1 color logo on the front and name and numbers on the back in 1 color, the shirts would be $15.75 a piece with a $30 setup fee + ($5 times how many different names). Also shipping is usually around the $20 mark depending on where you are located.
Thank you!

Thanks for the suggestion! I'll contact cryptografitti and see if they'd like to get a few printed! Our prices are usually a lot cheaper than teespring.
