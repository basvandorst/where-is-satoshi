Hey then :)

Yeah, I meant the new improved wallet design. Or is it the same click lock principle? :)

There is a difference between reverting to the last working git snapshot and making sure no further money is robbed.
Bitstamp can not resume operation unless the root of the problem is fixed. It's not a feature that needs to be fixed, it's the core that is flawed. Without making absolutely sure that the core system works again, they can't possible reopen the exchange.

Edit: I'm stupid. Didn't read carefully enogh. Sorry. Could you still provide a video of inserting the paper into the wallet?
Looks like a neat gimmick, **but...**
Since these wallets need to be broken to access the private key, how does the customer get the paper wallet insinde in the first place?
I assume the wallets already come with pre-printed paper wallets inside. If this is is the case, I'd not buy them. I don't wanna have to turst you to not make copies of the private keys.
Sorry. Not in a mean way, but one can never be paranoid enough.

While this *does* shine a bad light on BitStamp, I can understand them. 
Have *you* ever worked in software business? Then you'd know about ETAs.

Fuck me. I just sent them 100 € in cash yesterday. :(

It would be kinda hilarious, if we could get to not only fly to the moon, but also rescue greece.
