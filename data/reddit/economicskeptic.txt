Sure, I'll give my input. If it helps to explain where I'm coming from, I'll have my degree in economics in a couple of months; I did my thesis on the valuation of gold.
Bitcoin simply isn't workable as a currency. Let's ignore everything surrounding it for a moment, and just look at the program itself.
* You have a cap of 7 transactions per second. That is absolutely *laughable*. Imagine that we suddenly had 100% adoption in just the US. I sure hope you enjoy your yearly transaction, because you sure aren't getting more than that. Yes, this is something that can be changed, but that's not as simple as just raising a number, or this wouldn't be an issue in the first place.
* The entire mining system is an absolutely textbook case of tragedy of the commons. Yes, at one point it was just as simple as setting up your computer to mine and hey, bitcoins! These were paid out at a set rate. Then one guy invested money in a better computer to get a larger slice of that pie. Then another guy followed suit. Then someone moved to GPU mining. Now we have people spending thousands on dedicated ASICs, electricity bills are through the roof, the difficulty increase is always maxed out and for all of this investment, *they still aren't turning a profit*. When the next halving comes up, everyone is boned, and the frisbee isn't just on the roof, it's out in space. (Yes, in theory, people turn off their miners when it becomes unprofitable--except everyone will think someone *else* should stop mining, so that *they* can make a profit).
*Even if, theoretically, it was one day decided that cryptocurrencies are the way of the future... why would it be Bitcoin? It's a decentralized program that's open to anyone. If I'm the government making the move, why do I pick a currency owned by a bunch of internet people and riddled with technical flaws and a legacy of crime? Why not just... y'know, use my resources to create a new cryptocurrency and build infrastructure to support widespread adoption? Why, from their perspective, should they reward you for having left your computer running in 2012?
So that's some technical reasons. Then there's also the fact that bitcoiners... don't really understand economics.
*A deflationary currency is a horrible, horrible, horrible idea that discourages actual economic growth. For an extreme example just for sake of illustration, let's take three economies: one with 100% inflation year-to-year, one with 0%, and one with 50% deflation. To start my business/undertake some project, I need to take a loan of $10,000. Let's say it's 10% interest on the loan, and I pay it back after a year. (Yes, I understand the numbers aren't remotely close to what they would be under such a system, but the principles don't change).
Under the inflationary economy, that'll be $11000 I owe. But because of inflation, it's only $5,500 once you adjust for that. So the inflation rewards me for taking on a loan, because it makes it easier to pay it back (even if the interest rate outpaces inflation as it usually will, the inflation rate is still softening the blow from interest). Under the non-inflationary economy, I have to pay the full value. Under the deflationary economy, that loan costs me an additional *$11,000*. I'm better off just sitting on my hands than investing in my business, because the repayments are made so much more painful by the increased value of currency.
Now, let's consider the lender's perspective in those scenario: in an inflationary economy, if they don't lend, their money is losing value. In the stable value economy, they can just stay where they are forever. In the deflationary economy, they don't need to take on risk, their money will just get more valuable on it's own. So you'll have both the most willingness to borrow and the most willingness to lend in an inflationary economy--and therefore you'll have more economic growth. A good example is Margaret Thatcher in the UK--she throttled inflation, and that brought about a giant recession and a lot of unemployment. There's a similar instance in the US, but I can't remember the presidency quite as clearly off the top of my head.
There are limits, to be sure, but a low, consistent rate of inflation (2-3% or so, the US rate is 1.7% at the moment) is quite healthy for an economy. This is something that's pretty well demonstrated at this point. And Bitcoin tries to toss it all out the window because ???
There's more, but it's late and I'm tired, and I'll gladly explain myself more in the morning.
