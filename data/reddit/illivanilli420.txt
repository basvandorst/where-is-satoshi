Looking at your history, you clearly just bully people here. So have fun with your life. Must feel good being so smart, I bet it’s netted you lots of friends.

Somebody needs to get this guy an award for being so smart

The answer I needed. I get that products have a value, I just don’t get the concept of tying it. For example, I know certain currencies were actually created with a fixed ratio to the USD, like I think Argentina? Then when their economic structure screwed up, it screwed up the whole currency. Thank you.

Thanks for the help! You should become a mod of this sub, with all that knowledge.

Well I know we used to use the gold standard for the USD and broke away from that. I clearly worded this poorly, but I just was struggling to understand the difference between inherently defining a ratio value between two currencies (tying) and letting a free market determine a value for currencies. I guess “tying” is a concept exclusive to fiat currency?

Only catch is that things never end up happening the way people expect

There was an ad on reddit yesterday that said "The IRS can track your Bitcoin and will tax you on their earnings." Is that actually do-able?
