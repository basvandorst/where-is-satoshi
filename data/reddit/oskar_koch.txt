How about what challenges Bitcoin needs to overcome to become Global Reserve Currency?
@_date: 2018-09-15 07:12:23
...and in order to reduce that time what can we do now?

You need vision and a map kid, the above are a side effect ;)

A hidden gem for you: Cryptoconomy Podcast
Concise and thoughtful podcasts, been enjoying his material so much that I even donated recently. Highly recommend :)

RemindMe! 3 years "Can you buy a lambo with 1 BTC?"
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:21:58
this sums up my thoughts exactly

use this, just paste your transaction ID:
should take 2-3 hours.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:25:14
Everybody's so confused right now haha, I love it!

I'd say invest in education rather than speculation first. Think about earning BTC for what you already do. Give a 10% discount to encourage your clients.
Hodling is not a bad idea too :)

That's gonna be me when we hit 1.000. Historical moment : ))

The Ledger Nano S will support Segwit wallets within a few days according to their dev:
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:02:43
Remember why we're here, looking back this is gonna be just a small blip. We've got segwit coming down the pipeline followed by a number of countless innovations that will help us get true privacy as well as instant transactions :)

But also take into consideration that if lightning network reaches the amount of transactions that VISA does, then naturally the number of on-chain txs would increase significantly as well. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:06:12
That makes sense. Hmm.. so I guess the way forward is through user demand. Do we have any other options besides constantly messaging them about it? 
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:49:30
I did, took me an hour to figure out how. Hence wanted to clarify why it might be taking so long for businesses.

Sounds like buying a fixed amount (dollar-cost-averaging) every week/month would be the best option for you. You won't have to worry whether it might or not be a good time to buy.

Not bitcoin, but a bitcoin-like currency. Stop with those clickbait titles please ;)
"Palestinian officials are planning for the territory to have its own digital-only currency within five years."
"authorities are mulling a bitcoin-style solution"

Why do people even keep money on Coinbase? Take a minute and learn how to secure your money properly. It is YOUR money you're dealing here with :3

Lol, precisely. Bitcoin is essentially information. You can transmit it using an image, audio file or mail pigeon! Your imagination is the limit.
@_date: 2017-05-15 18:08:55
Isn't the point of bitcoin to become your own bank? Haha. 
Anyways, hopefully it'll introduce the concept of bitcoin to some new people and will help them when making a shift from fiat to sound money ;)

I personally would love to have this design printed on the back with a small white bitcoin symbol in the front left or right pec area. It'd kick ass!
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:22:47
Lots of promises, zero substance.
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:13:46
Well I won't mind actually. It'd be cool to show my grand children that million dollar pizza I bought a decade ago.
And if it ever reaches such enormous adoption, then i'm sure I'd be very happy with my remaining 99.98% of the stack.
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:42:13
Fuck yeah, finally can buy pizza with btc in my hometown. Let's celebrate :DD 
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:10:37
Beautiful, kinda sucks there's no option to buy it with bitcoin, but fiat will do too :) Thank you, you're great!
