Doubtful. This was it, and while the aggregate cryptocurrcy asset market is and will continue to change, I think what we saw today was a realization that big finance is both formally acknowledging BTC, and that they more importantly, want in. With time I hope further developments are achieved in the altcoin sphere as well; this is a fascinating conclusion for us.

Easy to say now. If I had the capital I would have done the same thing. Great risks carry great rewards and it was looking like this WAS going to happen. Now mind you, personally I bought ETH with both hands two weeks ago (sold at 7k) and have only re entered today but my point still stands.

How is this a conspiracy therory? This is exactly what happened. The fact that the asset made so much money is why we are getting no fork. Progress is yield, this is why BTC will continue to grow. It's about the only thing which is appreciating in a positive way right now.

What you are reaching for in your comment is really core economics: supply, demand and participant perspective. As there is very little BTC and demand is high, the market participant perspective is currently communicating a lower opportunity cost then FIAT. Ergo, for every dollar you hold you lose the pontential yeild in another instrument namely real estate, ETFs and more recently cryptocurrencies. Simple stuff yes, but this is more in line with what is happening as crypto has become less of a risk and more of an incentive to the community. Where I'm in compelte disagreement is in it being a store of value as we are still in early days. For now, BTC is still an investment vehicle (and a volatile one at that) which has gained concencous on the basis of its inate decentralization and tendancy to inflate relative to the aggregate economy.

Wow this makes me feel better about my trade... Bought ETH before fork was called off at 288 and sold at 318 when it was. At that point I crossed into BTC at 7150 and sold at 7200. Today I went all into BTC again at 6800... I wish I waited until now to buy.

The way I look at it: bitcoin is incapable of resisting. As long as it's an accepted means of exchange, store of value and unit of account it doesn't matter how many forks you have. Nothing changes.

Is that based on anything other then speculation? I'm about to enter the market.

Already have. Hopefully works. I'm sure I'll wait awhile for it though. Just wondering if it would be considered say 4 months old or something? As in June, July, August, September (I know that doesn't make sense) or if when they looked at it in October it would be considered that. Sounds like it's less then three months old though so thanks.

I've traded before, and graduated with an MBA in economics and this market is by far the most confusing. Despite this, this is why it is so fascinating. Only two things matter; supply and demand. Long term I can only see this going up as it is not subject to the same business cycle that fiat and other traditional assets - it's already crashed, flash crashed etc.

Isn't this exactly what speculative investing is?

I can legitimately see it hitting 7k by the end of October. Then I see it crashing back down to 3k. This is definitely a buying opportunity however.

That is a very well thought out and intelligent response. These are the sorts of things that make me confident in cryptocurrencies.

As in my opportunity cost is high. I'd rather have a return. I can lose though if I have to.
