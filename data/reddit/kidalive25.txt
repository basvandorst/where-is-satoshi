I'm surprised at the few number of comments in this thread that are celebrating your skills.  I think this app is gorgeous and would easily pay a non-subscription based price for it.  I like that you combine the news articles with the tracker since of the handful of trackers I use, I think only Blockfolio has a News tab and that's not my favorite app by any means.  This is really well done and I'll be keeping this one ready for as long as you support it.  Thanks!

Oh God you have a total USD invested amount field, you are my new hero.

Isn't it established now that the main reason it hit $20k in q4 last year is because of the events set into place by the movers behind the futures markets? If there's a future call for 100k and they call the long, then sure maybe this guy will be right.  But it might still be too early to expect six figures from a coin that has as many issues as it does.

$ .3 trillion crypto market cap? Pretty sure it's been under .2 for months now.

"Man with a fuckload of coins that have lost 80% of their value assures us that they'll be worth more one of these days". Can we please stop with the pointless novogratz articles?

Finney + Szabo = Satoshi

What about those that claim other currencies can help support BTC as well? That LTC is the silver to BTC's gold? I'm pretty new to this so I have no idea one way or another.

And that's the network already in use by LTC? and when that happens  for BTC, then LiteCoin will be less valuable I take it.

I know you're in a frustrating position but that make zero sense since their entire purpose is to sell it to you and collect the fees.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:19:21
That was most definitely my first mistake.

Oh god it never is

Don't all the recent gains have a huge part to do with anticipation of the upcoming fork? Surely this news won't boost it further..?
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:11:22
That's definitely the reason I did it too. Probably the best reason, can't think of a different one that would be more urgent than that.

If you're anywhere other than China, no.  Or I mean moving it to put it in storage is never a bad idea either way, but they'll still be relatively safe there.  As long as you have 2fa turned on. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:11:08
The 2fa is pretty bulletproof as long as a person is smart about it, but if actually owning your coins is important to you (and I imagine it is) then you have to get them off exchanges and into storage. With all the wildness and unpredictability, I definitely don't mind having my coins in an offline hardware wallet

Fuck's sake the guy was just trying to help you in a thread where the subject matter has been covered 1000s of times already and that's your response? Raging at people trying to help is a really weird way to handle that but ok.  
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:45:54
It won't.
