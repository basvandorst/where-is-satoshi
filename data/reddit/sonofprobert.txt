I don’t have an electrum wallet but I’ll throw in $50 plus the transaction cost for someone who does.

Yes, the fee is really low. Ledger had a problem with their transactions fees. Do you know how long it would take to go back to the sending wallet? I have no idea about how to add a higher transaction fee to it so any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

It's important to note that, "The bank chief said he wouldn’t short bitcoin because there’s no telling how high it will go before it collapses" so he won't put his money where his mouth is.

"The bank chief said he wouldn’t short bitcoin because there’s no telling how high it will go before it collapses." So he's talking shit but he won't back up his views with money. What a coward.

The fee with debit cards you pay is all of your information and spending habits being bought and sold.

I think it's the same rate as Schrute bucks to Stanley nickels.

Don't bet on it getting there in a day or two. I made a depo on July 1st and it just got in today.

The problem is that holding doesn't encourage broader usage and adoption by companies.

Hahahaha.

Because it's part of Coinbase, and Coinbase is always crashes when prices move drastically.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a hardware wallet? I've been looking at KeepKey. All of my bc is in Coinbase right now.

$300 when it was $2615 on Kraken.
