On the contrary, they know exactly what they are doing.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:09:26
Probably an inside job.

Step 1: Fake hack/steal funds
Step 2: create BFX
Step 3: ???
Step 4: Profit

Can someone explain how multisig wallets get hacked?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:29:07
You are only adding to the panic. The price will normalize soon.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:33:31
Just the same as losing cash.
@_date: 2016-08-18 20:42:17
This sounds like a setup.
@_date: 2016-11-04 17:33:10
I think I love you.

Dark Age? The sun still came up this morning.
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:48:54
You mean 'propaganda' don't you?
@_date: 2016-12-15 01:35:22
It will never happen.
@_date: 2016-11-07 15:24:21
There is an attempt to manipulate the many so as to be under the control of the few.

The dollar will be the first to fall, taking all the rest with them since the majority rely on the dollar to be taken as an item of value and we all know that people are waking up to the fact that the dollar isn't really worth anything.

Does it matter? As long as no one is trying to promote fiat currency run by the current system we got. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 15:03:58
You mean to say, create a debt based society.

A decentralized currency is the exact opposite of a centralized currency, too which the banks are a part of. The central bank is the perfect example. It seeks to control and regulate the money market without outside influence, like the majority. When you centralize your currency you give away your own power.

No. The point of bitcoin is to get rid of some intermediary who simply sucks interest while actually doing nothing. We are trying to get away from a centralized point of controlling our flow of energy(money). 
If we, the end-users, set the value of bitcoin then there is no risk of inflation. Currently we allow fiat currency to dictate the value and not the other way around. It is still too early in bitcoins acceptance for this to happen, but once it does banks will completely fail as will governmental agencies.

I guess if you want others to manage your money, with the ability to steal it from you, then I guess it would be your prerogative. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 00:21:25
Why would you exchange it for a currency that isn't controlled by you? Exchanging btc for the dollar would be silly because it puts the control back into the hands of the banking system.
