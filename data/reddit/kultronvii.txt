lmao have you even been to Canada? I don't think I've ever seen 'payment options' in a doctors office in my life.

100% of these “crypto art” things are so cringe worthy. Unless that’s the point they are trying to convey

Canada. Delusional is a perfect word, the entire world except the Republican Party of America knows that Medicare for all is the only logical choice. The facts don’t lie, it’s deluded to think otherwise.

Indeed it is, a country 60 years behind mine. It’s pathetic, really.

Lol 60-70%? Delusional. Cool story bro. You’re still wrong. You might not believe me now, but when you or someone you love gets really sick or injured you can think of me when you’re filing for bankruptcy.  Meanwhile I’ll be getting better care, for free.

Wow uh i guess bitcoin adoption is cool but am I the only one thinking it's a little fucked up to proudly display payment options in a doctor's office?

No one should have to pay money to visit a doctor. America is backwards in this regard.

Lmfao!!!! So all taxation is theft, right? Believe it or not, the government 'touches' healthcare in countries all around the world and they are much better and cost efficient than the USA. Shouldn't Americans be rioting in the streets then for all the money the government spends on its military? You sound like a psychopath.

The US government has directly led to rise of cryptocurrency in Venezuela with their sanctions.  Too bad Trump is a diplomatic moron
