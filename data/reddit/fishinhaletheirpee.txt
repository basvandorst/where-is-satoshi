you should go outside more

care to expand on that? as far as i understand it banks buy ATMs and then they own them. the fees are just the way for the banks to make profit from offering them as a service. maintenance fees from the manufacturer would certainly not be based on how much money went through them

shit like this cry for brigading and shutting down opposing opinions is the reason people think bitcoin is a scam and it's users are  some kind of brainwashed cult.
@_date: 2014-09-03 15:32:23
totally not a scam!
@_date: 2014-11-30 10:19:11
i'd like one please

according to my wife who is 35: hell no! i'm not part of that loser generation.
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:40:40
yeah, why seek the fault in the own community when you can make up a conspiracy?
i swear to god this sub gets dumber by the minute.
@_date: 2014-09-06 13:51:11
oh, honey...
nobody is denying that the current political and economic systems have flaws but ancap and libertarism are worse. those ideas are pants on head retarded
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:35:51
why would they want to shut BTC down? i bet the NSA loves them, it makes people and their money easy to track for them
@_date: 2014-12-21 20:08:48
do they have to be licensed?
i can hook you up with some germany based freelancers who work in that field
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:42:50
yepp, they clearly wouldn't want to take advantage of a technology that makes it easy to monitor money trails. instead they'd rather shut it down
@_date: 2014-10-01 09:55:41


that's insulting
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:46:58


seems kinda bizarre that it needs to be mentioned or is used as an investment rationale.
how fast can they be shipped out? how much and which kind of technical support is provided? 
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:22:01
VIRUS!!! dont click!
@_date: 2014-10-14 20:16:39
you don't have to like people to like their money  ;)
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:34:02
which evidence?  
i read a lot about the shit the NSA does but have to come across anything proving they are actively trying to shut BTC down.
how did i know that you would just downvote and not answer?
newsflash: your opinion is NOT evidence moron

purse.ios sole purpose is for fraudsters to cash out their stolen credit cards/paypals.
not getting a replacement for something you got from there is probably one of your least problems if you used that site.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:27:58
[thank you for proving my point](
you guys are so predictable
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:03:24
less than $50.
the reasons are (in no particular order)
the communities refusal to have an open discussion about problems with bitcoins.
that almost nobody spends them for legal stuff.
the toxic attitude that large parts of the community has.
the large number of fraudsters and scammers in the community
safety issues
btc is too complicated for the masses
the only safe way to store your internet money is on a computer that never touched the internet
the outright lies about features of bitcoin
half of the people here have no clue what they are talking about
more upcoming laws and regulation
how easy it is for big players to manipulate the price
and so on and so on
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:40:57
that looks like the ungodly lovechild of paris hilton and coco austin
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:44:46
it probably is a factor, but the whole debt thing is just a "diplomatic issue", nobody really expects it to be payed. every country owes other countries that owe them. if that would mean anything they would count it against each others debt. 
the main reason is to keep the chinese people and their money in check
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:42:06
absolutely. i guess that is what some people are just learning the hard way after the bubble burst
@_date: 2013-12-20 09:59:57
if any photoshop wizard could make a version with just the coin on a transparent background i'd be really happy
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:30:55
so he is basically talking about it being beneficial for some wall street and government types who are able to weaponize currencies with inflation?
the basic, it is good for the few with a lot of money so let's keep it who cares if it fucks up the small people?
@_date: 2013-12-15 12:46:20
a few days ago there was a guy who makes keychains and credit card sized cards with laser etched qr codes on them (can't find the thread right now, but i'll keep looking) why not set up a wallet, get a fitting card and give him that?
you can probably find a simple info graphic on the net how BTC works which you can print out in addition
EDIT: sorry can't find it. it seems to be deleted or i'm stupid :(
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:14:13


if you don't have a bit more than accusations you will be dismissed as a shill
@_date: 2013-12-23 12:43:00
didn't you predict it would be less than 100 by now a week or two ago?
or was that one of the other trolls who are always predicting the death of bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-15 10:05:22
i'd be interested,
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:08:29


could someone explain the idea/logic behind that to me?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:19:56
serious question: what is quark? and why is it so hated? some quick pointers in the right direction would be appreciated.
also: sorry that you get downvoted because of that OP, i don't think that is fair. in the end it is your problem if you deal with them when they are not legit
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:26:42
good idea. should i just ask for the coins i lost or also for the money that i didn't make with them when the bubble peaked?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:27:06
when do you think did the "big fish" got into BTC?
personally i think a lot started after the dread pirate roberts inteview in forbes which is the reason why it didn't collapse immediately after silkroad was shut down. or am i naive and most of them were aware much earlier?
would bitcoins be less attractive for pump&amp;dump if more people used them like real money instead of investments like they were intended to (imho)?
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:13:20
just realized that my numbers don't really add up. so you are probably right. 
i apologize OP. but i'd still like to see some evidence and not just rambling
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:49:48
i've bought and sold  coins there for quite a while. they are trustworthy. mostly i use the in-person option. 
as long as you meet in places like cafès you shouldn't experience problems.
the other options and the escrow system are good too
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:14:29
i think they are more concerned about people moving "chinese" money out of the country and not being able to get their share of it (taxes), 
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:22:11
but it is real physical money, not those shoddy imaginary coins you play around with...
it's just someone fulfilling demands. whoever buys that because he wants to get into bitcoins is probably better off getting scammed for a few bucks by that guy instead of loosing real money on the real thing because of stupid decisions and not even reading up the most basic things. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:28:30


uhm, sorry mate, i'm not from the states i'm from europe
besides that it **will** cause problems when the US raises the debt ceiling, but as long as it is possible to make money for foreign companies in america it is just formal

@_date: 2013-12-17 21:34:36
i'm not really sure, i know that has been discussed a few times but i'm not sure about the outcome because i didn't pay much attention due to the fact that the last coin will be mined in the year 2140 IIRC.
i personally think that if someone would manage to get all coins he would most likely have the resources, connections  and will to make sure that his investment is safe nad make sure that there are follow up coins. but that is kinda moot because the better way to get control over BTC would be to buy slow but steadily until you have like 60-75% (i'm no way a finance expert so the numbers might be not accurate) and then make your money by selling and buying at the right time
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:39:15
I'm really struggling to get a grip on stuff like this. i have a few coins and use them like i would use cash or paypal. i also made a few bucks when they went over 1k after buying them for under $50. but i'm not really interested in using them as an investment, i want to use them like they were intended as ...uhm... money. unfortunately i have the impression that i need to know how markets work if i don't want to loose money.
anyway. thank you for your input, i'll look into it. but i wish there was some simple rundown on all this economic stuff

greed makes even smart/tech savvy people do stupid things
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:25:58
as others already stated, it is impossible, but if someone would manage to do it they would become worthless if he didn't sell or spend a big portion of them 
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:49:42
wait a minute... dogecoin is actually a real thing?   
someone gave me about 70k of them but i thought they are just a joke, can i really tun them into BTC or money?
edit:ok just checked it, seems like i have $30 i didn't realize. weird
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:48:40
no idea if it is malware, but that site just crashed my browser badly after complaining that javascript was disabled..

localbitcoins.com  
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:46:55
that is hilarious!. thank you for brightening up a really shitty day.
what happened is this:
you bought coins at about 600€ (sory too lazy to convert that to dollars) but right now they are worth about 480€.
they didn't steal money, you lost it as a result of the bubble bursting.
sucks for you but isn't campbx fault
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:17:04
i don't live in the U.S nor am i a U.S. citizen and i did no business with U.S: citizens like a lot of silkroad users, that didn't stop the FBI from stealing my coins.
sure buying drugs is ilegal where ilive, but it is non of the FBIs business and they have no right to seize my money
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:44:15
thank you. that was really helpful.i'm a bit torn between both sides but in the end i think it is mostly about who makes profit from the different systems
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:10:45
happy selling, you won't regret it :)
