N=2 is an exceptionally small sample

That's a stretch friend. I understand what you are trying to say, but it's this is exactly the sort of estimation that is referring to that deteriorates the other much better points made by OP.

seems a bit contrived
@_date: 2018-09-24 18:11:44
... by using another moving average?

It’s unlikely for lightning to strike twice. Remember, economists have predicted 9 of the last 5 recessions.

I like Snoop's tunes, but have never bought one of his albums. I also have not owned any BTC before. If he releases his album with a BTC pricetag, I will remedy both of these vacancies in my life.

The comparison here makes sense, and I make it myself; but, as a statistician, it's not precise. Probably best to compare the percentage of Bitcoin used in illegal markets to that % of $USD used in illegal markets.
does anyone know the percentage of $USD used in illegal markets?

maybe time for a new FBI Director?
Instead of executing his mandate, Comey continues to whine about his job. Should get someone in there with a better aptitude for technology... fear is not a viable job skill for the director of the FBI.

What is the purpose of the 61% statistic?

Wow. Thought I was in r/libertarian for a second.

I always read these like, “why would you have 1000 pennies to a dollar?” ... but the period is a European thing, right?

I understand the interpretation, but what is the point of that statistic? ... it is factually arbitrary. Bitcoin's market cap in relation to the global money supply is a more useful statistic.

... then you should look at another chart, because this chart is telling me to sell.
Also... LINES AND PATTERNS!

Realistically, predicting anything further than about a year out starts to get shaky.

"a guy recommends bitcoin"

Everyone's like "I should have bought"... "I'll definitely get in next drop"; and I'm just sitting here bought in for the long haul... just gonna wait it out for 3-5 years, and see what happens. If the tech surrounding bitcoin keep evolving and general populations start putting all this to use... that's my day. Until then, I'm not budging my position... if it goes broke, it goes broke. If it goes mainstream, then I'll see you all in the Caribbean.

I think you've misinterpreted what the OP meant. I also dislike the "you're wrong because you just don't understand", since that perspective just makes the person saying such things look like a condescending twit.
Human Action is actually a very difficult read. I have a graduate degree in Economics and I can only really read it in bite sized chunks to make any valuable sense of it.
Maybe you are different, but I don't think the OP was meant to be condescending.

sounds like a convenient law, considering they can't do much about bitcoin anyhow.
