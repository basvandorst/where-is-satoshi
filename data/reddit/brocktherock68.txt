you can still send to previously used circle bitcoin addresses and they will appear as usd in your circle wallet, minus them shorting you a small bit.

so here's what happened.  my blockchain wallet page essentially glitched and showed the price of bitcoin $100 higher than it actually was.  I thought the price actually went up, so quickly tried to cashout $100 or so since I only owned about 1 BTC.  Right after I pressed send, the true price of bitcoin corrected to the real price.  Blockchain is supposed to give the correct fee by default.  I didn't manually go in and select a small fee.  That is the only thing that could have caused an error and is the only thing that happened differently compared to any transactions I've ever sent from blockchain wallet.  It shows 120 sat/b fee size.  Was that not enough?  Frustrating that blockchain auto picked the fee size and I can see now that 120 sat/b is mostly the same size used on my other transactions.  Don't know enough about the process either to know why it keeps attempting to send weeks later, instead of going back into my wallet long ago.  Gonna research what the guy above mentioned on sweeping into Electrum.

This isn't very comforting when trying to confirm withdrawal from poloniex thru email and they say to click the link to confirm and you get this error page....

Yes it was late April bc I was sitting in a hotel room and remember it clearly and messaged a friend about it at the time after the site glitched.
