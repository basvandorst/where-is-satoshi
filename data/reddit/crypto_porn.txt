Politics is the art of persuading and so every action has political energy. (Most) Bitcoiner's aim is how to persuade more people to buy in, so to increase their wallet values. No interest in ideals like ending warfare across the planet
Proof of Stake blockchains are more anarchy centric since their aim is to dry up liquidity in bank deposits, so crashing the debt these banks hold, and so collapsing the legacy system. This dethroning the current entrenched legacy power base.

Virtual validation of the blockchain so maintaining the highest security. Meanwhile a portion of the validating ADA , 15%, goes to the treasury and so the second level is community voting for ways of value add and strengthening the network. Be it bringing more smart contract business, or funding the ripping out of a certain country's failed legacy infrastructure and applying the Cardano blockchain as base for building the new economic, political, ownership infrastructure etc on. One country at a time, until all of the global economy is renewed.
