who cares if they keep the bitcoin ? All that matters is that now your bitcoin can the be exchanged for even a wider variety of goods.
One of the reasons everybody loves $USD is because pretty much anyone on the face of the planet will accept it. It doesn't matter people end up cashing into the local currency or not. What matters is your $USD gives you the widest variety of goods for purchase compared to any other currency.

You have a very flawed understandig of ecnomics on a macro scale and how national debt works. US is not doing great but is far from a collpase, frankly this idea is laughable and I'm surprised it so widlely accepted in this sub.

only if you have an emotional need to hold bitcoins then yes, other than that you're not solving a problem for yourself by holding bitcoins (not using it).


This is circular reasoning..
People hold because price is going up &lt;-&gt; the price will go up because people hold               
You gotta agree that this is a poor article that is aimed at just pumping the price. By the way the article is written on Feb 2014 so by his standard he is wrong. At the time of writing his article you would have had every reason to cash out. You will never find a negative article on that website. As awesome as bitcoin is you gotta be critical, something that is very difficult when money is involved.

I completely agree. You pay a premium to use Bitcoin, it's more expensive than paying fiat. But if what you want to do with the Bitcoin is not possible any other way, then you gotta think if it's worth it to pay that premium and be able to use Bitcoin to solve your need.

It's easy to get tunnel visioned by whatever you're working with when focused on a specific project. But I'm back home for christmas and had some extra time to spend reading up on it.
The only way I can describe why my mind is blown is that block chain idea is so simple and somehow obvious that blows my mind no one figured it out. Just like theory of evolution (random mutations and natural selection), simple yet infinitely powerful.

DUDE, chill out it's a comic not a state diagram.
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:45:57
haha this is amazing, and now you sent me my first transaction, this will be a story to tell in 50 years (do you remember your first transaction grandpa ?). Thank you :)

that's exactly what I'm doing right now in a few other tabs.

If you bought Bitcoin in the hopes of it going up rather than using it, you gonna have a bad time. Right now 95%+ of the bitcoins owned, are owned by people who bought it to sell it at a higher price. A very small amount are owned to be used. This is a bubble without a doubt. 
At the same time if you own bitcoins to buy on Agora, then you can use the same coins to buy more shit =&gt; win
@_date: 2014-12-24 03:51:20
Exactly you pay a extra to use bitcoin. It's worth if you want to make a transaction that you couldn't make otherwise. (don't have credit card, wana do some shady shit,tip people over internet,...)

updated my post.

interesting. But the crucial; difference is that I can take hold of your Bitcoin address from another part of the planet using math. So a little different in a sense that it's not physical. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 02:11:22


That's where your analogy for Bitcoin fails
@_date: 2015-03-25 03:39:01
That's very true. Thanks man.

Yes public domain, please steal.
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:36:44
There might be an announcement coming up. I saw it and the only reason for them to go to the trouble of creating a Bitcoin button is that they're gonna take it, I just don't know why it went away. You saw it here first.
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:02:17
haha yes it was a 1 hour flight
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:46:36
Honestly I'm not fucking around, but if it was me reading this post I would think it's shopped as well. But I saw it, it was there....now I'm starting to sound like a mad man. But if/when it happens I'll send everyone in this thread $0.5...I would be so happy.
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:32:40
This is amazing new, it's a wide appeal service that people have trouble paying for using traditional systems. This is where Bitcoin shines.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:16:54
ye and few days ago you said it's photoshoped now the host of FTR__Radio (Followed by Matt, Kim Dotcom and Marc Andreessen.) confirms it. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:53:08
read my first comment, the button goes to a page that says 


Or the link may be broken. Or we've taken the page down. Please take your pick.
Try these. We're pretty sure they work.
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:41:38


ye the Paypal logo is pixelated too, super sketchy. /s 
I Saw it myself, Just wait and if they announced it remember you saw it here first.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:42:11
I saw this myself couple of days ago, but the button lead to a page that said "This page is sleeping" . 
@_date: 2015-02-04 06:12:56
My redemption will come with time. I'm sorry I jumped the gun on posting before going through with the purchase. The fact remains that the button was there but went to a 404.
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:25:31
Was so excited to see the Bitcoin logo that I had to post here before even clicking the button, now it goes to a 404. Anyone else managed to see it ? I'm in the Spotify UK, are they testing this out ? I'd LOVE to pay for Spotify with Bitcoin, since I'm not in a country that they operate in yet and have to use Gift Cards from Purse.io and fake countries. This makes perfect sense for them since I know there are a TON of other people who would learn the shit outta Bitcoin just so they can pay for Spotify from other countries. I hope they're working on it...fuck I'm excited...I'm refreshing their page every second now
The page that the button linked to said
