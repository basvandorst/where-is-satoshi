When my bitcoin was stolen on Wednesday it was worth almost  $1800, today it's worth $2000. This is so sad

I can't be sure of anything anymore right now.. Stealing someone's hard earned savings is just heartless..

Thank you lots sir.. You know at times, it's in human nature to want to take bigger risks.. Thanks again

It's really sad.. I alone have access to my computer, so no way anyone got hold of any of my detail.. I have a functional AVG on my system and I check for malware often

I recently(Nov 29th) got robbed, and my bitcoin stolen by an hacker(all 0.17141083btc). This has been a sad and unfortunate experience for me since all my savings were put into investing in those coins. Whatever the Lord put in your heart to do for me, I would be most grateful. 138uyX1NTAEiqKpjfwbL6hZ1fgJ9V8tPaA. Thank you.

Thank you for the encouraging words

This might be true.. But to think that I ve always been careful.. Hard earned savings gone in a matter of minutes.. I cried for two days.. Really painful

0.174btc at that time cost 1800 at that time, it's definitely worth more now.

Thank you.. Just hard to believe some people can be that wicked 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:26:20
Yes I do.. But your coins are safe.. Just don't ever login your details into any untrusted device or browser.. All the best
