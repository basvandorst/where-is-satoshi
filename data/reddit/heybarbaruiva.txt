So I should really just go with the Antminer boxes then?

But can a S7 box mine other forms of currency as well or just Bitcoin?

How much does your S9 nets you per month, if you don't mind me asking?

Damn. That's way more than I initially thought. Gotta make some calculations now, maybe the S9 is indeed the better value around here as well. Is there any other investments besides the S9 box itself + a PSU? Do I need a dedicated graphics cards like a 1070 on top of that?
Also, how 'plug and play' are them? Do you just plug them on the PSU and turn them on like a regular PC? Do you need to set up the OS?
Sorry if I'm bombarding you with questions.

I know that, but unfortunately they're the only company selling their machines in my country. I would gladly buy the Avalon boxes if they were available here or if importing them wasn't such an expensive process.

I know I can make more with GPU mining since I don't have to pay for power and have access to 220v, but wouldn't I be too late for the game if I were to invest in a 1070 rig at this moment? Using today's numbers, a 3x1070 mining rig where I live would reach ROI in 6 months. Isn't that too long in our current situation?

It won't. My powerbill, if I had one, should be about $500/month as is and they don't care. It's truly free.

Thank you for the reply!
Have you worked with Antminer S9s before? And if so, could you share a bit of your experience with me?
I've been using the calculators around the web, and I'm getting wildly different results from each. Some say a single S9 would net me almost 600 a month, others say close to 300. Would you happen to know which one is closer to the truth? Or if you could share a reliable, or as close to the truth, calculator website, I'd really appreciate it.
And also, would you say mining with ASIC boxes is a more stable investment than mining with GPUs?
