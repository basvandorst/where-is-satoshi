These posts/articles are so fucking stupid lol. It's above 9000$ for a few hours? IT'S HOLDING 9000$+ GUYS, BUY IN!!! Like what.. Give it time to prove itself, it's not even above 9000$ anymore, and it has been bearish for so long. Stop being so quick to switch from Bear/Bull you bipolar emotional rollercoasters.

It is delusional. What do you base this so called "support" on? The fact that the price is relatively still? It's been for days, with variations coming in at certain times. Bearish trend lately.

Was a joke, they had a huge issue with accidentally charging 2-10x the amount people bought for on their accounts.

Wow you sound like a genuinely nice and honest person. Not. Disgusting ape. Also that guy is lying, you don't just magically lose access to your mail containing 150k$

Fair, didn't mean to attack you, just saying the two situations aren't even remotely comparable on a macro level.

Who else knew this was gonna be another one of those "I sold so it's going up again" threads?
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:40:28
You'd do yourself a huge favour if you stop being delusional rofl.

Yes you are right, getting from whatever low it went back to 400$ is the same as getting from 7000 to 20000$. How could anyone question your flawless logic, gonna go all in now thank you so much.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:27:46
Yes it's common. It's their way of earning money, the fees aren't enough. Prepare to get double or tripple charged on your purchase too.

These posts are so dumb. One candle or hour or day in the green and they always come. Stop looking for reassurement.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:21:48
Lmfao, you're a moron. "Liftoff!" "I was right, it's going all up from here!!" when it has a green candle. Green candle doesn't mean it's now a bullish market.

@_date: 2018-03-30 02:15:15
How many of these "Bitcoin is back!" threads are you gonna make moron?
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:48:26
Wow, what you just said made so much sense and is totally how the market works! 
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:26:26
You are right, I was rude, my apologies. Maybe I was too quick to judge, I just see it so often - People flaming people who is of the opinion that the market is going down further, bears getting flamed and ridiculed, and bulls having the craziest emotional switches, making threads about "BULL MARKET BACK!" if there is one day of green. Sorry for your losses, my advice would be to be more patient. I for one have been 80% tethered and just adding my new fiat to an exchange since mid February, just waiting for the market to turn before I jump in. Anything now is a gamble, and an unfavoured one I'd say, as it's likely to drop lower.

Not anymore it isn't.

You deserve to lose all your money. The first deposit in January was unlucky, but if you have kept "buying the dip" these months, even the last week, you deserve every loss you will get. You're way too impatient. It's been pretty obvious/the general consensus the market was only going to go down, yet you FOMOed/greed into a bear market that probably hasn't reached bottom yet. That's on you, you fucked up. Nothing to do with whales. I'd have sympathy, except people like you are the same people that flame other people who's saying market is going lower, or flaming them for sitting in Tether/USD, calling them FUDsters or morons, and then saying "What did I say!!!" when the market goes up 5% one day. Learn patience.
