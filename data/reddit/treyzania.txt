Really it's more that new users aren't running nodes as much as older users.  This isn't intrinsically problematic as it points to them using web wallets, which if fail then lose the funds for those users only.  But it decreases the percieved security of the network more generally, which is not good.

If you read the paper they're designing accounts not intrinsically having a balance.  Accounts can publish "applications" and those can ascribe a "resource" to accounts, and accounts interact with the applications to move funds around.  Or whatever else they want to do.
From a purely technical point of view the Libra protocol is fairly interesting.  And is definitely more trustworthy than just rows in a database somewhere.  What they intend to do with it is pretty shitty but we shouldn't dismiss the code.

Honestly you just need a Raspberry Pi.  That being said, recent developments like utreexo massively decrese the requirements to run a full node, so running a full node on a microcontroller with only a tiny amount of flash memory is becomming closer to possible.  Running a lightning node on top of that is possible but probably won't happen until the protocol stabilizes a lot more.

The block reward takes the form of the first tx of the block being given "extra" funds that the miner is able to do whatever they want with.  If the tx is modified ("edit the payout") then the tx changes, which changes the tx merkle root in the header, which makes it a different header and makes the PoW you just did useless since it was for the other root.
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:52:00

That's not nitpicking.  The author fundamentally doesn't understand how the technology or the academic processes involved in its underpinnings work.  SHA-256 had been in use for years before Bitcoin used it and both it and elliptic curve cryptography is extremely well-understood, including limitations and (quantum) attack vectors.
They also don't exist in a vacuum and they didn't come out of nowhere.  The concepts underlying SHA-256 had existed for a long time before the NSA designed it.  It's been thoroughly vetted by the academic community and it's extremely unlikely there exists some polynomial time algorithm to predict preimages for a given hash that the NSA might happen to know.  Especially now that there's so much potential for money if you broke it.

It does require that a node be online, but not 100% continuously.  Periods of being offline can be tolerated as long as you can keep watching the blockchain/mempool for broadcasts of old state, and you can actually offload watching the blockchain to another server that isn't publicly accessible, as long as it has some way to broadcast justice transactions in the event that your counterparty is being bad.

If you're dealing with logical storage or memory, the increments are almost always in terms of powers of two.  So 2^16 is 65536, so it did have 64k (65536 bytes) of memory.

Might not be a great idea to run it on your own computer.  *Just in case* you lose power and have a hostile counterparty.  Better to set up a VPS for $5/mo (or less depending on where you rent from) and run the node there.
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:21:30


That's not really how it works.  All the Bitcoin-derived coins use the (basically) the same scripting scheme/VM, with very slight variations, like extra opcodes to do different things.
See: 
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:16:19
No they don't.  The worst thing they can do is stop responding, in which case your node can just break the channel and after a timeout both parties have their funds at an address the wholly control.
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:13:25
Contribute to Lightning instead.
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:04:56
You *almost* can via Lightning.  Intermediary peers only know about the peer in front of them and the peer behind them in the path, you can have channels between peers that only know about each other via hidden services.  The hard part at that point is actually getting the bitcoins and opening a channel to the other peers without being traced.
And with Schnorr sigs things get even better, since closing a channel looks just the same as a multisig address.
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:55:40

Or just make all coins on the same network.  Lightning could be designed with heterogeneous networks with multiple coins operating in parallel, as opposed to multiple LNs for different coins, with swaps between them.
That's what they're working on [here]( and while it's still pretty beta it works pretty well so far.  Sadly it's not compatible with the BOLT-based LN, but that's not really a goal of the project.
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:35:22
51% attack when?
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:24:58
It could slow it down, yes, but with intelligent caching it might be possible to prefetch it into faster caches.  Plus it would use a lot less power and it would be cheaper to mine than on a "real" CPU.
The best option honestly would be to change the PoW all the time, before too many people had built ASICs for it.
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:26:07
A few altcoins do that.
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:25:43
This is the correct answer.  AISC are circuits specifically built to do one task.  And it's a well known fact that in CS that systems designed to do only one thing are better at that thing than systems that can do a wider range of things
All it takes is someone to fab a line of ASICs that pretends to be a CPU doing the CPU PoW.
@_date: 2019-03-16 22:08:08
It's not perfectly untracable in that if two channels collapse while a payment is in progress you can see that the same payment was moving through both channels, and other vulnerabilities like that.  Or if channel parties collude.  But in practice payments are started and finish within seconds and channels tend to be long-lived so this isn't a problem.
There's also a lot of work going into making it harder and harder to identify channel opens/closures with things like taproot and some clever elliptic curve math.  The lightning-dev mailing list has a lot of discussion on this matter.
@_date: 2019-03-16 22:09:49
Most nodes automatically accept requests to open channels as there's virtually no downside for them and the game theory says that it's in their best interest for the network to be very dense.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:20:00
Stick a bunch of memory on the board and put any data necessary on there before computation starts.  ASICs are already really expensive so putting something like 64GB of DDR4 on there would be feasible.

This is not true.
This does nothing to obscure the transaction graph like how Zcash does.  Mimblewimble can make that harder to do after the fact (and makes txs more compact too), and Litecoin is in the process of actually implementing that.  But saying it's the "best privacy coin" is totally misleading.
@_date: 2019-11-09 02:44:13
Once hardware wallets have miniscript and PSBT integration then you'll be able to combine A and B.  As in, needing multiple signatures from multiple hardware wallets (maybe a 3-of-5) in order to send a tx.
Of course, you still gotta keep some coins in a hotter wallet, it's going to be a pain to coordinate all those different wallets every time you want to send a tx.  Maybe keep a ~0.1 BTC on one hardware wallet you keep handy and another 0.01 on a mobile wallet so you can send it easily.
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:22:31
You can just disable the pruning option and it *should* just keep downloading new blocks and filling up the storage.  You'd have to resync the chain to turn it into a full archival node though.

not necessarily, it can get more difficult sure, but it doesn't have to
@_date: 2019-10-04 04:59:58


This is correct.  But miners typically don't have a lot of coins in reserve in backlog and are often selling coins off, as they have to pay for power with their local currency.  So they're just *not* going to sell their coins for much less then twice what it was before they adjusted for the halving.  And if they're never going to sell their coins for less than what it cost them to mine them (which just roughly doubled per coin), then other sellers will start to raise their asks as well.  The price *will* trend upward because of this, though it will be over the course of some time leading up to and then for a while after the halving.
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:44:34
TL;DR: Yeah, if you can
@_date: 2019-10-12 15:56:07


This is difficult to build, but there's been some work in that direction.  Some exchanges do have onion addresses already though.


The closest you'll get to this is Ethereum.  Bitcoin is not designed for something like this and it would prooobably require a hard fork to be a thing.  Even in a trustful context this is an Extremely Hard problem to solve.  The BEAM is kinda in this direction but it isn't designed for adversarial environments, only "the machine failed ans some tasks died but we'll keep running".
All of the other things you're talking about hinge on solving this impossible problem.
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:40:03
It's not exponential, it's still more-or-less linear with the number of blocks assuming the difficulty doesn't drastically change.  The "6 confirmations" is just because that's about an hour and any spontaneous mini reorgs probably won't dig deeper than that.

Sometimes blocks are mined at the same time and it's a toss up as to which block will be mined on next.  So if a tx was in the block that gets orphaned then it will switch from confirmed to unconfirmed, but it'll confirm sometime in the next couple blocks in the longer chain anyways.
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:50:51
Oh I see, we're talking about different things.
Yeah it's correct in that with each block it gets exponentially less likely that an attacking miner will "get lucky" and mine blocks successfully to overtake an honest chain.
But assuming that we amortize that out, it *costs* on average, about the same amount to mine one block as it does the one after it or before it (ignoring drastic changes in overall hashpower).  So if you're trying to reorg from 5 blocks behind it'll cost you *about* 5 blocks with of rewards to mine on that chain in the form of lost opportunity for blocks on the honest chain that you're reorging out, plus the cost to overtake blocks that were mined on the honest chain since you started your attack.
So in terms of reorg cost, we can think about block as taking a fixed amount of resources (money/electricty/etc.) to mine.  The "exponentially more difficult part" if referring to a &lt;51% miner "getting lucky".

Go look up OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.  Use that with an OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY to ensure only you can spend it, obviously.  But to spend them you'll have to construct the transaction manually using something like python-bitcoinlib.  You can play with this concept using miniscript right now though.
Also, really what you're doing is creating a utxo that can't be spent until x time has passed.  *Not* "making a contract that sends it back to your wallet".  After that time has passed you should send it back to a normal P2WPKH address.

Keeping a continual hashrate of &gt;50% (as in, being in control of the chain tip for an extended period of time) is extremely expensive for a network on the scale of Bitcoin.  That's why attacks on other chains still are shortlived.  Of course, the simplest kine of attack a small batch of double spends so that's fine, but for more advanced attacks like trying to prevent particular people's coins from being double-spent you need to keep mining every time you see txs you don't like in the mempool until they expire and stop being included in other miners' blocks.

Not at all.  A very large subset of transactions don't care about confirmation time and fees of several dollars are more or less reasonable.  Lightning channel opens and closes (and splices) can fall into this category, as well as large corporate transfers, people's rent payments, etc.

A merkle root is a commitment to a set such that you can provide a proof for the membership of any element of the set.  The block header is 80 bytes and includes a merkle root of all of the transactions (32 bytes), the hash of the previous block (32 bytes), a nonce (4 bytes) and some other information.  This data is run through SHA-256 to produce a hash, then that is run through SHA-256 again (because of certain types of attacks that can be done by reusing midstate) to produce *the* block hash.

Well you could write a script that talks to your node over the bitcoin p2p protocol and then writes block data over a serial port, then have another one on the "offline" system that stuffs blocks coming in over serial to the node via the p2p protocol.
It's not really worth the trouble.  Just stick up a bunch of firewalls (and use QubesOS I guess) if you want to be paranoid.  If you're running on Windows this is all moot though, you should want to be running all Linux natively (and preferably with a dual booted windows install).

They generate a privkey, have someone send to an address that can be spent from with that privkey, create a tx spending those coins to some other address you control but don't broadcast it, then destroy the privkey.  Now what you want to do with that raw tx after this is up to you but it lets you trigger the spend of those coins to the pre-determined address but you can't do anything else with it.  If you give it to someone else they can use it as a trigger to move the coins but they can't spend the coins to a wallet they control.

You can set the nLockTime field to say that the tx is only valid after a particular time/block (but it's more enforceable with a script that uses OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY).  But if you still have the privkey you could just sign a tx that spends the coins immediately, which is why there's some value in destroying the privkey after.  But "triggering" the raw tx is all of connecting to a node and sending a packet with the tx in it, it's pretty low-level and anyone that has a copy of the tx can do it.  But if you use nLockTime to make the tx invalid before a certain time/block this has to be done after that date, nodes will reject it otherwise.  It has nothing to do with Caribbean anything unless you make it.

Instead of making a bunch of static transactions and needing to use a ton of chain space (and taking a long time) to spend them just make a multisig wallet that needs several (more than like 3 or 5) keys and store the *those* in different places.  Unless you reveal the key beforehand there's no way to know how many keys went into a multisig script so really it's slightly more secure than the "keep each tx step in a different place" scheme.

That's not entirely true.  The most important blocks are the most recent ones, since more recent ones are more likely to be reorged in a 51% attack.  And day-to-day users that only sync every few days (think like someone on their laptop) only need the most recent blocks anyways.
The network is more harmed by SPV nodes which don't check sigs at all, only that there's new blocks on top of the ones it knows about.  The "health" of the network is more determined by number of actual validating nodes which would refuse to relay invalid blocks, not the number of archival nodes since the network would still function pretty well if there was only a tiny number of archival nodes.

JavaScript having a weak, unsound type system and failing to provide strong guarantees of any kind makes it exceedingly difficult to reason about your program.

There's a reason all serious software is written in languages with something that looks like static types.

While most of what you wrote is on the mark, this bit is interesting.  In LLVM assembly you can specify integers of whatever size you want, including 51 bits, and then the compiler backend will just "figure out" how to represent them on the target machine architecture.  In the case of 51 it will probably round up to 64 and then do some fast bitmasking after every operation to make it act like 51.

This is all kinds of untrue.  There's a [reason]( that corporations spend millions of dollars on [formal verification]( of their programs when running in highly-secure or extremely-high-performance situations like aerospace or embedded environments.  C has a world of security vulnerabilities and that's a reason that Rust has been making leaps and bounds with regards to safety.  JavaScript is even worse as we can't prove that some silly mistake in one part of the program isn't going to cause a problem in some totally unrelated part of the program.  Go isn't quite as bad, but having collection types throw away type information when casting between `interface{}` basically removes all the guarantees that static types give as Go doesn't have higher-order types (like every other serious language like C++, Java, Rust, etc., even Python has generics and it doesn't have static types) to create specialized collections that preserve type information.  Having a *sound type system* is generally a good idea if you're writing code that lives in an environment where security is a priority, and I would hope that Bitcoin (currency) is one of those.

Not *really* tying up funds, just now you can spend them in a different way.  And with splicing you can send to on chain addresses without closing out your channel.

Not really a problem if you have multiple channels open with different services, plus web-based services are *usually* online most of the time anyways.


Splicing and multipath payments make this not really an issue either once those are fully deployed.


This is true.  You should be sending huge amounts of coins around with lightning since it's just not *for* that.  Ideally you'd keep no more than ~0.1 coins in your lightning wallet and keep your big wallet somewhere else (which should be offline).  Think of it like a checking account.

Additionally, even though supposedly google has achieved quantum supremacy, the computers still can't handle problems with state on the order of the elliptic curve crypto used in Bitcoin.  You would need many times the number of qubits that have been entangled so far.

The size of a close tx depends on how many payments were in flight through the channel when it closed (specifically, 1 outputs for each party, then 1 output for each HTLC in the channel).  Currently, c-lightning has a default limit of 30 HTLCs, but you can increase it to up to 483.  This is a perfectly reasonable size tx given that the 100-peer coinjoin from a few weeks ago had *well over* 100 inputs and 100 outputs.  (And LN closures only have 1 input.)

Since quantum attacks on sha256 are less feasible than quantum attacks on ecdsa it seems like it would be possible to develop a scheme that lets you prove that you know the preimage of the address, and then prove that you can produce a signature for that pubkey, and then commit to a new quantum resistant (or simply just larger) new key, maybe with something like a STARK, who knows.

You should count on the chain growing by up to around 100GB/yr.

Also, IIRC, since the Media Lab's DCI is only an *initiative* not a Media Lab *group*, they don't actually have access to the main Media Lab funding pool.  They seek out funding on their own.

This.  You don't need to be storing the entire chain history to be running a full node.  Only if you want to run an archival node.

You should make it yourself.  If you send your mnemonic to someone to stamp into some metal and send to you you're basically just giving them all your coins.

Remember that these HTLCs usually only live in the channel for a few seconds before the payment confirms and they're removed and the new balances for each side of the channel are updated.

TL;DR: On chain everything is satoshis, represented as an 8-byte uint.  It's translated to a longer more human-understandable form when displayed in UIs and in APIs.

Won't use it because it's an Electron app and will use 10 times as much memory as it needs.  When are we going to get a normal Qt or GTK application?

The events of 2017 showed that we don't actually need miner consent to implement a fork as economically important parties have it in their best interests to follow the chain that's most safe.

Sure you *can*.  But it makes it much easier to correlate funds with your identity so it's really not a good idea.  Doing a "test" transfer isn't really necessary either as long as you make sure you copied the right address, unless maybe you're sending from multiple sources.

The Casper finality layer is actually PoS based, although it's not used for block production.  Eth2.0 actually does use a PoS block production scheme.  This isn't like dPoS used in EOS and other right proper shitcoins though, it actually affords more permissionlessness.

This are still amortized out with constructions like channel factories that multiplex n^2 channel opens for n parties into a single tx.

Quantum computers can't help us with ultra high speed computation.  They can help greatly with very specific kinds of problems, such as prime factoring, [encryption cracking]( and some others, but it is useless for most other things.
Sure, we'll learn things about miniaturization while developing commercial quantum computers, but ultimately we can't make processors go arbitrarily fast.

It was actually considerably safer and more convenient than buying off the street.  Merchant accounts were sold in auctions/raffles and they had to build reputations over time.

Theoretically yes, but you shoudn't as it's extremely expensive for the network.  IPFS would be better.

It's likely just done programmatically.  The equivalent of a big "move to cold wallet" button that a developer pushes, which generates a new pubkey(s) from a root one taken from the cold wallet by hand and sends the coins to that.

There was a story on NPR about this last Monday.  Very interesting.

Small clarification:
Silicon has an atomic radius of ~111 pm, or ~0.111 nm, making the diameter about 222 pm.
The issue that were having is that within the silicon gates the electrons are quantum tunneling around the different parts of the transistor, skipping around the very carefully organized electric charges that make the structure so useful.  This occurs at distances of a couple of nanometers, so that's why the limit is about 1 nm.
There is some talk of using grapheme (an allotrope of carbon), or entirely different light-based computers.  These both require many years of development, so the industry is rather slow to fund the research.

Probably just an exchange moving some money around.  The inputs are all fairly large sizes.  One output is exactly 15k BTC and the other is the remainder.  Could be some money moving from hot wallets to a cold wallet.

c-lightning is much less nonsense to work with imho, despite the fact it doesn't (yet) let you do multiple channels per peer.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:49:38
I just found it (and btcd) really awkward and unintuitive to set up and use.  (Also btcd is kinda really slow to sync.)  Meanwhile c-lightning has pretty much identical semantics to bitcoind and "just works" more regularly for me.
@_date: 2019-05-09 03:05:12


By cracking it via deriving the privkey from the pubkey, no you can't.  But you can certainly break into the systems that exchanges run on to steal the privkey or cause all kinds of problems internally.

So what's the point?  I can use PayPal/Venmo, Square, wire transfer, or anything else if I want to not control my money.

That's &gt;100 years from now and by then bitcoin would be worth enough that the tx fees we have at that point make it a nonissue.

Why doesn't Ethereum just take bech32 and encode addresses like that, with an `eth1` prefix?  Addresses would be shorter, too.  Are they really going for that much of an psychological equivalence between a contract address and a memory address a la `printf("%p", &amp;contract);`?

It's possible, it'd be a pain in the ass but it's probably doable.  To take advantage of Lightning though they'd need to go back on the whole point of being not-Bitcoin though.

They're Layer 1 and more importantly, they're custodial.  Which is pretty antithetical to what Bitcoin is supposed to be.

The economic majority decides the protocol rules.  The consensus algorithm doesn't care if there's a chain with more work if it doesn't follow the rules.  That's why UASF can work.
