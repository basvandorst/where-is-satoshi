Just bought it, can't wait to read it before Roger Ver's AMA

Lol this is so funny. Especially because apple is such high quality tech with open source development of disruptive advancements. Long live Bitcoin and quality memes.
@_date: 2018-09-27 23:23:04
very inspiring. Sometimes I forget Bitcoin isn't new fledgling tech and think of it as a billion dollar industry, this article does a good job reminding me.
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:48:22
that would be a great and generous thing to do.
@_date: 2018-05-26 04:41:52
We should do whatever necessary. A online chat forum or 250k to dying children?

He wants to encourage free speech AND donate to charity. You are ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-05-26 06:54:01
I'm spending time right now trying to help them. You are actively fighting against helping them.

Babies are dying
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:36:54
free speech is an idea and ideas apply universally. Just because its not mandated by law doesn't mean its not something we should aspire to or uphold.
@_date: 2018-05-26 02:55:59
Seriously? You write a long article about price movement, your personal gains and preferences based on your convenience to argue against charitable donations. Yeah, I'm the asshole
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:05:47
me and yes
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:48:29
clear how? Because I'm actually willing to sacrifice one of my subreddits to help people in a worst case scenario that adding another mod ruins Do Mods own subreddits, the subscribers or Reddit? Authority is the weakest argument and saying that because someone has mod status they should be able to dictate the subreddit is Tyranny.
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:49:22
We have a controversial subreddit here, why not just cut our loses and do some good? Replacing mods would be helpful to eradicate rumors of censorship
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:51:04
This time babies are literally dying and Roger himself will do something about it if we just cut out the cancer that is censorship. He doesnt want control just change on OUR terms. we choose new mods not him
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:28:34
250k charity is worth more than a chatroom. Remove all mods, change rules, ect. Anything to help Charity. Fuck the mods, these kids need to eat

wow ty. really makes you think about how ridiculous it is when they call it, "imaginary internet money"
@_date: 2018-03-07 01:20:01
its okay if you say "n*gger" but completely inappriopriate without the star? fucking ridiculous
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:45:06
They deleted the post
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:44:31
Made a post titled "I like 'Bcash' as a name". not sure how to post modlog
@_date: 2013-07-04 22:14:49
What if I just want to sell at the best price?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:38:13
Took some digging but this comment was a real gem. Respect
@_date: 2013-07-18 07:10:21
So btc-e users commenting this is the weekend dump, can any experienced traders explain how this works?
@_date: 2013-07-04 18:00:43
That's a great idea, will do! Thanks!
