I appreciate abdada's words of wisdom. I appreciate any help. I'm fairly new to this and I don't want to make too many rookie mistakes.

I'm not sure what you are suggesting...BUT I LIKE IT!

Did you participate? Were the deals actually pretty good for what you got?

Congrats!

Thanks! I'm learning more and more about security and the whole concept itself. I plan on holding onto what I have for the long run. Not gonna panic sell/buy and I dont risk what I dont have. :)

Alright, cool!

You forgot the /u/ part.

I bought .17, it was about $50. I will probably keep buying $50 every paycheck. I saw that you could set up recurring purchases. I might look into that.

Yeah, I know about this. I'm signed up for it. This is what I'm asking about. Is it the first time something like this has been organized?
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:20:57
That's perfect! Thanks! I didn't even think about that!
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:29:57
Yeah, I'm using Authy. Is there something else I should be using?

Thanks. I'm using Coinbase right now. I will look into securing my wallet. I tried to use the wiki pages in the side bar yesterday but they seemed to be down. But today is a new day at work so I have plenty of time to do more research.
