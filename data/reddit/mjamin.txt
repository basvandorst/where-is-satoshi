The Blockchain is like a ledger. Each block is a page in that ledger and contains transactions that have been verified. Like pages, the blocks have a defined order and unlike pages you can only add new blocks, but you can't easily delete old blocks or modify them. To even attempt to do that would cost you several hundred million USD.
An unbreakable chain of blocks, containing every transaction that ever happened in bitcoin.

Blockspace will always be scarce and some transactions will always outbid by others for quick confirmations.


Maybe you can't have it both ways right now: money that's not subject to irresponsible government action (or majority rule) and cheap fast transactions. But please acknowledge that this is not because of core, but because of every service provider that doesn't make use of the capacity that is readily available since august. Venezuelans also have other options in the interim, e.g. Litecoin.


If you're a company that has been screaming for more capacity like many have and signalling support and readiness for it, just face saving should be incentive enough.


SW2X is also SegWit, so it just doubles the hardware headroom you need. Your point doesn't make sense.


Agreed. SegWit roughly doubled capacity, while the worst case blocksize is ~3.7MB under adversarial conditions. It achieves that without risking a network split which, as we can see, is virtually guaranteed in a rushed and/or controversial hard fork. It was the quickest &amp; safest way to doubling capacity, therefore in the best interest of people in Venezuela.

Why should that matter? It's not supposed to be a manual on how to save on fees. It's simply showing that Voorhees was cherry picking data to make a point.

The tweetstorm by John Newbery:
**TL/DR:** With SegWit and a 24 hour confirmation target, a fee of $0.05 would've been enough at that time.




 your perspective on fees is incomplete. I'll offer an alternative version. I had a flight so I spent some spare cycles and 30 lines of python analyzing your chosen block. Here are some results:
Firstly, mean tx fee is a really useless measure. For example, your block contains this tx:
 [
That tx was almost 100k and paid $1876 in fees. Outliers like that affect the mean disproportionately. Your block had 1881 transactions. That means that tx 745879e... alone contributed about $1 to the 'average' fee.
[that tx weighed 40vkB. It excluded everyone else on earth from using our most secure ledger for a whole minute for just $1800. Cheap!]
A better average would be median feerate multiplied by median transaction vsize.
Doing that gives us a feerate of 264 sat/vB and vsize 226 . At $7176, the fee is $4.31. Ok, that's still pretty high.
But really, you want your transaction to have the *lowest* fee-rate of all txs in the block. That maximizes your consumer surplus.
(No-one wins a prize for being the highest paying tx in a block. It's just additional miner surplus)
Lowest feerate transaction in your block was [ 101 sat/byte - which would be $1.63 for an average sized tx.
Of course, that single transaction could be out-of-band, or a stingy-parent-generous-child. Let's take the 80th centile feerate to be sure.
(why 80th centile? Because it means that if your transaction was in the mempool when this block was mined ...
... and it had this feerate, 20% of the transactions in the block would have a lower feerate. Your tx would almost certainly get included.)
80th centile feerate is 260 sat/byte, so $4.22.
But you probably don't want to optimize to include your transaction in the next block. If you can wait an hour, you'll get have lower fees.
We should look for the minimum of the 80th centiles for the block and the 5 subsequent blocks
That gives us a good measure of what fee rate would be required to get in one of those blocks.
Doing that gives us a feerate of 191 sat/byte, so an implied fee of $3.10.
Often, it's fine to wait 24 hours for your transaction to be confirmed. If your primary concern is fees, you can save a lot this way.
If you were willing to wait that long, your transaction would have been confirmed with very low fees.
Block 493114 for example cleared out the mempool down to sub 10 sat/vB transactions: [
If you'd sent your transaction with that feerate, you'd have been confirmed for a cost of $0.16.
Let's try to do better. There's an opt-in, voluntary way to access scale on Bitcoin - segwit.
If we use a segwit input instead of non-segwit, the vsize have been lower - probably 208 instead of 226 for this simple transaction.
With that weight and a feerate of 10 sat/vB, the tx fee is $0.15. That's almost unfairly cheap!
You have access to these savings *today*, simply by using segwit and being prepared to wait a bit for your transaction.
Let's take it a step further. If you're prepared to batch your transactions in groups of 3-4, you could easily save up to 3x.
( wrote a great article about that [here](
What are we down to now? Around 5 cents?
A bit more radical, but absolutely possible with today's available tech would be to use channels for recurrent transactions.
Again, depending on spending patterns, that could save you 10x, 100x, 1000x.
Point being, a single number doesn't capture the opportunities for scale and efficiency that are available to us today.
The blockchain is a precious and scarce resource. Let's use it that way.

Why do you think all those companies do not make use of the available capacity? Most have been claiming readiness for SegWit for a long time now, yet they don't use it now that it's available.
The need for more throughput doesn't seem to be as urgent as they claimed?
Also, it's perfectly valid to consider the worst case scenarios as spam / DoS attacks on bitcoin are likely.

This is a (mostly automated) translation of a twitter thread by Simon Lutz:
Is Bitcoin a waste of energy?
- Yes, Bitcoin needs energy.
- No, that energy is not wasted.
Bitcoin transforms energy into ultimate financial security. For the first time in human history, it is possible to convert energy as the currency of the universe directly into a global, open, neutral and transparent form of money for all people.
The traditional banking systems employes millions of people, who commute to work every day, cool their offices with air conditioners and individually represent a security vulnerability. Bitcoin just completely discloses energy consumption for financial security.
Currently, the Bitcoin network uses about 0.01-0.03% of global electricity consumption. Bitcoin forces miners to look for the cheapest energy. This creates a positive side effect by allowing miners to profitably reuse excess energy from industrial sources.
Many miners source electricity from hydroelectric power plants, as it is often the cheapest and abundant in certain regions. Solar plants also produce a surplus of electricity at peak times.
This is difficult to store, leading to inefficiency and longer payback time. While renewable energy sources generate a surplus of electricity, the Bitcoin system can be strengthened and energy can be used profitably.
This allows sustainable energy sources to be made more profitable and provides an incentive for more investment in this sector. Every four years, the jointly followed Bitcoin protocol halves the reward for blocks found.
Halved income forces miners to look for cheaper sources of electricity or turn off their devices. Long-term economically active miners have a clear incentive to obtain electricity from sustainable sources, because Bitcoin is a financial 'project of the century'.
Significant concealed costs of fiat currencies are rarely thought about, let alone spoken of. Inflationary money generates a consumer society and leads to a short time preference.
This refers to the fact that man acts under scarcity and therefore prefers an earlier fulfillment of his wishes to later ones. Inflation serves as motivation to spend money as quickly as possible or to invest in something.
Subtly, this has a massive impact on society, culture and, ultimately, the environment. On the one hand, goods are produced in abundance by artificially increased demand.
On the other hand, real estate, land and other limited resources are misused as value investments in order not to be exposed to the disintegration of the purchasing power of money.
This ultimately manifests itself in inflated prices for the aforementioned objects and makes the acquisition more difficult for future generations due to the unnatural monetary surcharge.
We rarely stop to think about these factors, having grown up in this unsustainable system and know no other. Moreover, these hidden costs are very difficult to quantify and would call into question common economics.
Finally, don't forget why fiat currencies have value. They are based solely on confidence in the power of the state, trust in the country's economy, and confidence in the nebulous competence of the respective central bankers.
Every year, approximately 1,700,000,000,000 (trillion) dollars are used for armaments worldwide. Everyone can imagine the hidden energy consumption these military personnel waste, among other things, in protecting national currencies.
There's a lot more to be said about that. At the end of the day, however, a discussion is purely theoretical. No one in the world can do anything about Bitcoin's electricity consumption in the long term. Critics are forced to come to terms with the reality of whether they like it or not.

The biggest obstacles to activating SegWit are Jihan Wu &amp; Roger Ver. If they're OK with Frankensegwit, they should be OK with SegWit as it is deployed right now.
But for some unknown reason the hard fork aspect is incredibly important to them even if it results in the same effective blocksize. Right now I'm simply waiting for someone to figure out that Frankensegwit coincidentally maintains covert ASICBOOST compatibility or something along those lines.
The attempt to shift the blame to this sub or the UASF idea is disappointing.

Core will not merge Segwit2x. It's a game of chicken where one side does not care at all and the other has 12.5 BTC to lose every 10 minutes.
If, as unlikely as it is, core comes out as the minority chain and btc1/bitcoin is effectively the new reference client, you're stuck with whatever developers contribute to / merge into that project. Those are probably not the same developers that will continue to work on bitcoin core.
