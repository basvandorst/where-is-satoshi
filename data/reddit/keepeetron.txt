wait no.. this would require an endless increase of value.. and at what point does it become so mainstream that we stop judging its value by its exchange rate to other currencies?
this shit hurts my brain

man I can't help but feel that he's just repeating what his dad told him like a year ago, something that they were gonna do together as a project .. but then he left and never came back and so the kid is woefully out of the loop but still holding on to the idea
or something

why would you traffick via metal coins when you can just do a transaction? .. and if you want it off-chain then just hand over a tiny slip of paper with a private key on instead of a bunch of metal objects
also isn't long term storage simply achieved by storing a private key too?
I mean this sincerely, I dont own any bitcoin so I accept that I'm probably missing something

oh god i clicked. what is this
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:05:51
a padlocked key just seems wrong on principle, though i'm not sure what to suggest otherwise

im sure there are types of ink/paper will last way beyond our lifetimes.. and what's up with a 'metal wallet' when you can just put a paper wallet inside a safe?

Something may be scientifically explained, but whether it's ethically justified or not is a different matter. 
so are you saying that evo-psych, is often undertaken with bias, or that the authority of it is co-opted by men seeking justification for matters of ethics?
I guess my point is that, objectionable scientific statements should be contested on the right grounds..
if it's false, then it should be contested on scientific grounds
if it's *technically* true, but you object to it's wording or for example, over-generalization, then contest it for those aspects specifically.
I just feel the author of that bingo sheet is implying that psychology has no connection with evolution, which to me sounds pretty ridiculous..

I always thought it should just be a circle with a vertical line overlapping it. It'd be super minimal and it's like a zero and a one (the on/off states of a bit)....  genius i know, thanks

The point of irony is that they did not mean what they said..what it tells us of the person is that they think the act of turning things pink to get women interested is a silly idea.

i'm all in favour of indulging in nonsense for the creative hell of it, or to achieve that crazy/'over the top' design ideal, but this is probably just due to not knowing

What incentive is there for a manufacturer to sell ASICs when they're still profitable?
Isn't that like selling a tree that grows money?

With some of these boxes, I genuinely don't understand where the author of this is coming from through the sarcasm.


you are delusional if you don't think wealth, in general, is a factor in attraction, in both men and women.


science should be concerned only with what's true, regardless of opinions.. 


Well I don't know if this is true or not, but it's irrelevant to whether we think gender dynamics are right or wrong. Just because something is 'natural' doesn't mean it's right. 


what is the auth suggesting exactly? If life was not driven to propagate, it'd end up dying without doing so.


there is a gradation between innate and acquired


if genius is defined as 'a recognized and massively contributing individual to science', then i will take this bait and say yes, most geniuses are men. but obviously it's completely irrelevant to what is true or not and doesn't mean women can't be 'geniuses'


both of these things can be measured..  attractiveness is subjective as hell, but you can still come to a generalized conclusion. 


Whatever traits that help themselves get passed on will continue.. again, it's irrelevant to whether something is right or wrong. 


uhh yes? Abstractly, science is just learning reality...   a chimp prodding an anthill with a stick.. or kids kicking a ball around are kind of doing informal science, they're learning the shit out of physics. I think that curiosity and the want to play/experiment are both innate, and to some degree, acquired

how can a writer/artist not feel slightly obliged to learn *something* about whatever it is they're about to reference, before just dropping it straight in there?
I guess this is what physicists must feel like every time the word 'quantum' gets pulled out of a nearby ass
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:52:42
and at what point in this comment chain did they assume that?
