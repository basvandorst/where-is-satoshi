Only people that missed out hate on btc

Nope. There are more....... I used to feel guilty. I used to have more Bitcoin. Now people I have advised are  making tons of money. They used to laugh when I talked about Bitcoin. But they own more money than me and are investing relatively less money but making more profit. That sucks. But that's life. Don't feel guilty. There's more to life than btc of Fiat. 
And Hodl. Bitcoin community is hard core. Lessons learned. Don't trade!

Respect!!! Wish i had a technical background. Wish I had your financial position. Yet I seem to do the same thing wrong every single time. Sell low buy high. Hodl doesn't work for me. Just panicking all the time. Next to a blessing Bitcoin is also a curse... for me! 
Good luck with everything!

Subliminal messages for kids means hodl. They are raising them on Bitcoin. This means it's going to be the future. 
I can imagine a day that people will laugh at us saying things like: 
"Father. I it true that 90% of all paper money was contaminated with poopoo bacteria and coke?"
"Did a wall street wolf sniff coke from a models ass with paper money and then payed for a hotdog with the same paper?

Remind me. Your son is going to be angry at you for not invest his savings in Bitcoin. 
On topic: the kid's a great visionair
