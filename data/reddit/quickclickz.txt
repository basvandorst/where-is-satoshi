? It's been tested plenty. The fiat value of the goods does not matter.  It is the market value of the crypto * the crypto used that becomes the number subjected to both capital gains and supposedly sales tax.

When there is a recession and you lose your job and stay unemployed for 4 months and the choice is lose your house and everything you own or sell some owns and last another few months. 
Again i'm not saying we're necesarily heading towards a recession but to say "oh only hodlers left.. can't go any lower.. no one is around to sell it" is naive and is the prime example of the economic/financial knowledge of your general crypto owner.
