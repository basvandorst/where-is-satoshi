Lost so much on quarkcoin. Not seen someone mention that coin for years.
Still in the alts mostly as there's plenty of room for Crypto in this space and the alts rise more than btc when they run.
I see BTC is struggling to scale again though, that's what brought in the last alt season. I've plenty of time to wait :)

Hope are those tx fees and delays going now? 
You accept btc is useless when popular yet?
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:43:48
Scary times, isn't it?

Crypto.com cards for the Americans soon, no?

lol LN has been on the horizon for 5 years...no point holding your breath.
@_date: 2019-04-26 09:43:01
You've got a lot to learn.
@_date: 2019-04-25 21:01:50
BTC is useless though. Were you here in 2017?
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:44:55
Well the fact it's struggling to scale, just like in 2017 is what's keeping informed people away. Imagine waiting for 30 minutes while visa confirms a payment that you're paying extortionate fees on, then all of a sudden decides to ignore your TX.

umm...btc was useless dec 2017...when it was $20,000. 
Obviously you weren't here. BTC can't scale, ergo it's useless as a currency or anything tbh...which is why the narrative went from ''digital currency of the future'' to ''muh store of value/gold standard''. 
Lol, and don't bother with the whole ''muh lightning network will solve all problems''...yea, good luck with that. You've clearly not been in crypto long.

Bitcoin can't scale, that's why. Did you try spending it when it was $15,000. It was trash
@_date: 2019-09-10 13:43:33
Can't wait to sit for 3 hours at a petrol station waiting for confirmation after paying with BTC because I forgot BTC can't scale. Lol

And this is why the wider community don't like /BTC or /bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:33:21
Lol, comedy gold. Don't waste my time, I doubt you could explain anything.
@_date: 2019-05-01 11:29:56
BS!!! People's transactions were being cancelled because miners weren't confirming due to wanting high fees. I seem to remember it costing over £35 or more to move £1000. Transactions were taking hours if not days!!

So you agree that bitcoin had problems in 2017? It certainly gave noobies a bad impression when they tried moving from CB to their wallets. It's arguably why /cc got so popular because people were realising other coins existed that did what BTC promised.
I agree things are different now and BTC is faster, I use it regularly. But you can't deny the issues it has faced. I take it back that it was a shitcoin, but I won't say it's better than some others. It's biggest advantage is first mover, brand awareness, age (which also benefits the fact it's spread out more).

Lol I've been holding BTC since 2012. I'm also a mod of the /cc discord. Whilst I don't claim to know everything. I'm pretty well versed on using btc. Been using purse.io  since 2014, I'm well aware of how shit it was in 2017.
