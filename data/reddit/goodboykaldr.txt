Lol I re-discovered bitcoin during bitcoin winter from a economics post bashing it. I was like why do these people hate it so much? So I researched it and never looked back.

You mean they are going to cause the spike in price, then right after payday they are going to liquidate all the longs like they've been doing and rinse and repeat.

By the time the technology is adopted by the masses, it will be called Cent-Cost Averaging.

Who cares about Gigameg. Will it run Crysis? That's what's important here.

The title is misleading, the smartphone will host a limited node with the option of housing an external SD for increased storage. The increased storage will give the phone full node capability.
Nonetheless this is EXCITING news, and proves that companies are willing to bet big on blockchain technology.
I would not be surprised if several years down the line a bigger company innovates on HTC's phone, allowing for more MAINSTREAM adoption.

First of all, before I make a statement I'd like to set the precedent that I am not an expert.
With that said, I never said anything about the product being a success. Only that this news proves companies are "willing to bet big on blockchain technology."
It is hard to tell without seeing a physical demo of the product.
I find it interesting that the first article that mentioned this new technology came at the same time BTC was having a hard time pushing through the 7k resistance. I believe the article was meant to fuel further speculation.
I feel that if HTC is successful with their potential product and are able to capture enough of a market share of the smartphone market, they would have leverage to be bought out by a bigger company. A possible end goal of theirs. After that time will tell.
