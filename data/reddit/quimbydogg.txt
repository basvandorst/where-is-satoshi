I think the reports said the database leak included around 60,000 accounts so somewhere in there.

฿ is actually the symbol for thai currancy.  Bitcoin should really be using a different unicode character long term.  
I always liked Ⓑ myself

Finally got my main rig on mtred.  Was trying to get it up the last few days but it always got a lot of invalid/stale messages.  I added the bfi int aggression 11 flags and it seems to have solved most of my issues.   I still get some invalid/stales but not nearly as many.
It is interesting how running the same command on one pool can give you totally different results on another pool.... way too many flag options to play with.  This is starting to suck up hours of my time :P

Distribution of wealth in terms of bitcoins probably isn't going to be much different than standard money distribution in an established currency.
If you look at things like total net wealth in the US, the top 1% of the population holds over 33% of the wealth.  The next 19% owns about 50%.  Which means that the bottom 80% of a American's control about 15% of the wealth while the top 20% control about 85%.  Keep in mind these numbers are from a few years ago, it is probably much worse now.

No such thing as a sure bet... this is why it's important to gamble only with money you don't mind the possibility of losing.
And who knows, value of bitcoin may end up even higher in the long run.... hope so for your sake and mine :)

The intermittent reinforcement that gambling and most mmorpg loot systems use are considered by most in psychology (from what I remember from undergrad) as the most addictive habit forming reward system.

I was under the impression the protocol allowed for correction of this.  (able to change the lowest represented value)
