NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- A class-action lawsuit has been filed against bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and its owner, Mark Karpeles, said the law firm that's filed the suit, Edelson PC, on Friday. The firm said the lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Illinois on behalf of all persons in the U.S. whose bitcoins were held by the exchange, and it seeks certification of two classes, the return of user bitcoins and damages against Mt. Gox and Karpeles. A plaintiff named in the suit, Gregory Greene, alleges he alone has lost $25,000 worth of the virtual currency, Edelson added. Mt. Gox has said it was filing for bankruptcy protection and that 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins and 100,000 of its own had been lost

RogerVer's vouching for Gox was one of the reasons I lost a lot more than 500 BTC. So fuck him. He should not vouch for shit he knows nothing about.
There is a possibility Gox was solvent when Roger made that statement in 2013, in which case, he is redeemed somewhat.

If you are interested in the consequentialist justification for voluntaryism then as I posted before (but you obviously ignore it) then I refer you to David Friedman's Machinery of Freedom, Murray Rothbard and Practical Anarchy by Molyneux. These expose the reasons why a free market is much more efficient instead of government institutions.
The deontological justification is just much more concise and works on people who have a sense of morality.
I just find it interesting how you evaded my points about the Jews, NK, torture. You might want to dismiss the moral argument, but then you cannot answer my simple questions on it otherwise it would bring you to conclusions about your beliefs which you yourself do not support.

Financial institutions go where the money is. I don't see what that has to do with regulation of the financial industry. In the USSR, there were no private banks to regulate as they were all state operated (so 100% regulated)- yet there was little money there.
The reason you know that people don't want banks to be regulated is because banks that are not regulated are not allowed to exist. If people wanted regulated banks, why would the government stop unregulated banks? Surely nobody would be their customers right?

My opinion on the matter is irrelevant as it should be your wife and you that decide how these problems would be solved when you both sign a marriage contract you both agreed to. Not an imposed contract by the government.




Except it's not a contract as one cannot decide the terms of this contract. It's take it or leave it one-size-fits-all typical government dictate.
In a free society, people could decide under what terms they would like to get married. This is not currently possible.
I recommend this article : 


Society is not the government and that's why we have two words for them. Society is just a group of people living together. Government is a local monopoly on the use of force. Quite different.


Please define reflects? Does Hitler/Mao/Stalin/Obama/King-of-your-choice reflect on society? Should I hold you  responsible for unjustified wars in Iraq/Afghanistan, rendition, torture, NSA spying? After all, it's a reflection on you.


I'm confident people can work it out without violent overlords (government) imposing their views on how to deal with these issues.

Here is some info I found about Selachii 
I read the whole thread on  when the Selachii directors were (allegedly) involved in debt collection. 
It appears Richard Howlett (Capital Credit Management) was working behind the scenes with Simon Taylor (Lasker Int) to get debts paid back but denying they knew about each other. They both are directors of Selachii now. 
I guess debt collection is a dirty game, but they don't appear very clean either (at least from this post).

Individuals are moral agents, they have a right to be secure in their life, liberty, and property. These rights are not granted by government or by society; they are inherent in the nature of human beings. It is intuitively right that individuals enjoy the security of such rights; the burden of explanation should lie with those who would take rights away.


To govern: Exercise authority over; impose regulations
So no, a polycentric law system does not require a central authority to govern. People choose to use a dispute resolution organization and -unlike with governments- they can patronize another organization if they find better services elsewhere. Governments do not give you a choice. It's one size fits all. It's there way or prison.




I don't understand your point. So theft exists and you have no opinion on it? Nor do you have an opinion on a system that facilitates and encourages theft such as the government?
Can the majority be able to claim ownership of the minority's property or not? Is this a universal rule you support?


I can win any argument by shooting my opponent in head and declaring I was right. But this is not what sane humans refer to as a convincing rational argument backed by evidence and reason. Might does not make right.
What planet do you live on?


I am not making an is out of an ought. I am saying that if you make a rule as to what is right and what is wrong, then that proposition can be analyzed with logic as to its validity. If you propose that "theft is immoral" then this proposition can be analyzed as to whether it is consistent or not. I refer you to  for details.




In practice you are. Ask Kim Dotcom.


Yes you are defending this because you agree that a government has a rightful claim on all the land of its inhabitants. So how can you not defend NK? It fits perfectly with your definition of government. Why do you make a special case for NK?


So I can own my body but I cannot own my labor. Does someone else own the body heat I generate? Can they demand to take it from me? Can they demand that I work for them through force because I do not own my labor? You have a strange conception of self-ownership.


The State IS a tragedy of the commons and that is exactly why having a state is the worst possible system. Modern democracies are specifically created for the express purpose of establishing common property across an entire State region, so that neighbors may loot each other without fear of reprisal.




So you have no problem forcing other people to follow your preferences? You defend an involuntary system?




Just rescind your nationality? Seriously. Do you know how hard it is to rescind your US citizenship?   . You have to justify yourself why you want to do so and they plan to take 30% of your wealth.


But you don't own shit and you know it. If I'm a shareholder of a company, I have share certificates and a shareholder agreement which I voluntarily signed. Where is your country property contract then? I'd love to see it. Can you trade it?


So you defend Hitler exterminating the Jews if it was a majority decision of the German people? Seriously?


But that is exactly what the government does?! It claims land it does not own by force. Have you opened a history book?


You know of any?


So in other words, you are saying I can leave but there is no land without a government - except the middle of the sea. So  basically in all practical terms I cannot leave. Thanks for clarifying.




So on this desert island, I can swim away and die - or be subjected to torture. You would be fully in support of the the island inhabitants torturing me because it is their land? I guess I am talking to a monster. At least, we have clarified that too.


Well, I thought that throughout our debate by government, you meant democracies. I thought you were a defender of democracies but it seems that you defend anyone or group that imposes themselves by force - because we need to be governed. 
A monarch is the strongest and most ruthless tribal leader that beat all the other violent tribal leaders, and claimed their territories and anointed himself God's chosen one. There is not even a veneer of 'majority approval' with monarchies. Do you support monarchies too?


My point is that it is immoral to initiate force. The government is the initiation of force so it is immoral. 
Given all countries were formed via armed conflict then their claims are not valid. Even if their claims of ownership of the land were valid, they could still not initiate force just like you and I cannot initiate force.


Do you at least recognize these flaws? It doesn't seem like you do. There are many ways to run society without the use of violence (see  for links to videos and ebooks). But until you see that government is immoral, they are pointless to discuss them. 
It's like telling someone who is driving North wanting to go South that they are going the wrong direction. It doesn't matter where South is exactly, what matters is that the driver recognizes that he is driving North in the wrong direction and he sits down and checks the map.

@_date: 2014-04-17 14:09:05


It's not because the majority agree on something that it makes their claim any more valid. When a gang of thieves in a dark alley decide in a majority to beat you up, it doesn't make it any more valid because their decision was democratic.
There are definitive methods to determine ownership of land. The courts deal with this on a daily basis. None of these methods involve one party using force to appropriate land or getting a big enough group of people to agree on a land claim to make it true.
The government says it owns the whole country. They have no claim to individual ownership of each piece of land in the whole country. The only claim they have is that they will use force to impose their will.


No it isn't. If I have a rule that I can torture people who enter my land, can I say you implicitly agreed to it? Please apply a bit of  common sense.


Where do they say a natural born person in the country should leave the country if they do not agree? 
You think when governments drafted young men into their armies they gave them a choice to leave?


Owners cannot initiate force. The government initiates force. And government doesn't own the land either.
If a ship rescues you at sea and the captain says that he can now torture you or force you to work for him, would you be fine with that? It's his boat. His rules. Right? You can always leave i.e. drown.


Because the hotel owner is the legitimate owner of the hotel. He also does not initiate force against you. Nor does he claim to have a monopoly on force in his hotel. And you do agree to an agreement in the terms&amp;conditions at bottom of the invoice.
The government claims ownership of a huge mass of land that it has not homestead - which was already owned by other people. People were living there well before a government claimed ownership of their land. The government just used force.
How it is not obvious to you?
If the government is such a benevolent force for good, why not imagine how it would fair without its police/military. How long do you think people would keep paying their extortion fees (taxes) or respect their laws?

Great. So to govern is to use force to enforce preferences (e.g. laws). That is what differentiates governing from say managing. A manager does not use force.


You make the rules because you own the house yes. Yet, you still cannot rape/murder/steal, even within your own house under your rules. You cannot initiate force. You can only ask people to leave and use reasonable force to get them to leave. That's it.


No. Because nobody owns the whole country. No group does either.


No. I don't make the rules. I don't want accept the mechanism by which these rules are made or enforced. So the 'we' you use is 'us' because there are many people that do not agree - me included.


You cannot assume ownership.

No you haven't because you clearly don't understand the NAP and private property.


I said the initiation of force is wrong and should not be legitimized via a government. I didn't say everyone will be good and that's exactly why we shouldn't give some people the monopoly on force because there are bad people. 
You are the utopian who believes that a group of people (who you state cannot all be good) should tell others what to do by force and that everything will turn out fine. Open a history book and see how that turns out.


That is such a basic neophyte question it clearly shows you know nothing of polycentric law. You don't think that is the first think polycentric law deals with??? I gave you links to this.


So the German people along with Hitler murdering the Jews, or someone torturing someone who washes up on their shore is totally fine with you. You gave me no answer to this. Therefore I conclude you give your full support to this sort of system, and you even spends hours defending it on reddit.

The manager works for the property owner (the company owner). He **does not use force to get you to work at his company**. It is a voluntary transaction (work for money). However, he can use reasonable force to remove you from his property.
There is no ownership by the government of the whole country. And neither is the interaction voluntary. I do not have a choice whether to be ruled or not by a government - even if my family has been living there BEFORE the government arrived.


No, because I cannot initiate force. Nothing to do with a country. My house does not belong to the country. It might claim it does but it has no evidence of my agreeing to it.


No. Even if a country owned all the land legitimately, it could still not impose its laws and taxes on me as I have not agreed to them. It can only ask me to leave - which I you know is not what governments do. They don't say: "If you don't want to pay our taxes, you can leave" because it would imply that I have a choice in the matter.


Individuals own the land. I don't care where past kings/despots/dictators/presidents have lost or won battles with other entities to carve up their country. I have no consented to their ownership claim, nor their laws nor their taxes and neither have you. If you have consented, where is the agreement you signed?

John Betts on the Hangout yesterday said they would invest THEIR funds in the exchange. He talked about millions. I see nothing mentioned here. 
Why would it cost $10M to investigate? Just hire an accountant and a bitcoin expert for 1 months to go through the transaction history and we'll know where the funds went.  


I thought they had the best interests of the creditors at heart. Why do they need a further 10% fee? Aren't the $10M going to pay for the investigation costs already? Why do they need a further 10%?


You mean he's worked for the Goldman and Morgan thieves? Great reference... NOT. 


Signed by SOME customers. This is misleading.

It would not be a disaster because we would judicial oversight over the liquidation process. With Scamlot, they can do what they want with our funds once they own Mtgox.


Bouchery might be responsible for the theft of the fiat/btc as far as we know - he was at least overseeing parts of Mtgox during this theft - so I don't trust anything from him. He should be in jail for all I know.
McCaleb might also have his hands dirty. Maybe they are both pushing the Savegox plan so that they can push the blame on Karpeles with the help of Sunlot and away from them.

TOKYO—Mark Karpelès arrived in Japan in June 2009 with his cat and his hard drives.
Less than five years later, the Frenchman faces accusations his company has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars for customers of his bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, where all transactions have been halted and users remain unable to access their money.
Is bitcoin another flash in the pan? Or are the early investors onto something -- that will make them rich? WSJ's Jason Bellini has 
Mr. Karpelès describes himself on his LinkedIn profile as primarily "a technical geek." His profile cites "a long experience in company creation," but the snowballing popularity of bitcoin and the resulting growth in Mt. Gox's customer base appear to have raised challenges that were more than the company, under the 28-year-old from a suburb of Dijon, in eastern France, could handle.
On Wednesday, a day after Mt. Gox shut down, dealing the most severe blow yet to the bitcoin world, Mr. Karpelès issued a terse statement on the exchange's website. "I am still in Japan, and working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues," the statement said.
Those who have followed Mr. Karpelès's rise and fall close up describe him as soft-spoken and mild-mannered—"geeky but kind," as one person who knows him put it. They also say he is a talented software developer.
Computers have indeed been part of Mr. Karpelès's life since he was very young, according to a 2007 French documentary. His comments in the film together with a charting of his online presence—he has blogged under the handle "Magical Tux" and posted on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter—paint a portrait of an inquisitive mind.
"I can't imagine a life without computers," he said in the documentary, which mentions Mr. Karpelès but focuses more broadly on geeks. He said he sometimes didn't move from his room for days.
"In real life, if I want to talk to someone on the subway, I'm just a nobody. But when I am on the Internet, I am Magical Tux," he said in the film. Even now, people in the bitcoin community refer to him by that name.
On a blog last updated in 2012, which appeared to have been taken down by early Thursday in Tokyo, a person identified as Magical Tux indicated an interest in quantum physics and writings on the existence of alternative worlds. He wrote in one posting from March 2010 that he had been up till 5 a.m. reading about theories that "are giving an extra role to conscious beings, even making them immortal."
But Mr. Karpelès also showed a domestic side online, posting cat photos and bragging about his skill at baking apple pie. In 2006, he uploaded a how-to video on YouTube, outlining a more-than-seven-hour process for pie baking.
In the documentary, in part produced by French broadcaster Canal Plus, he spoke to the camera in a messy room, surrounded by comic books and computers. A black T-shirt he wore said, "There's no place like 127.0.0.1.", referring to the number used to redirect a computer connected to the Internet to itself, or home, in other words.
An anime fan, he went to Japan for a monthlong visit in 2007. Back in France, he triumphantly announced on his blog that he had wowed one Japanese girl with his iPhone, a product that wasn't then on sale in Japan.
By 2009, he said he was planning a move to Tokyo and posted a blog entry in Japanese. "I do computer-related work (a programmer); my goal is world domination," it said.
Soon after he arrived in Japan, Mr. Karpelès got interested in bitcoin. "One of my customers requested bitcoin as payment in 2009," he said in an email interview on Feb. 17.
Less than half a year after his arrival, he founded Tibanne Co. The name of the company, which would come to operate one of the world's pre-eminent bitcoin platforms, was close to that of Mr. Karpelès's white-and-orange cat, Tibane.
Mr. Karpelès's Twitter feed indicates that in the early days, Mt. Gox was like any other small tech startup. The team went out for burgers together, and McDonald's deliveries were common.
People close to the company called the atmosphere of the Mt. Gox offices "free-spirited" and said the company's growth was a surprise.
As bitcoin caught on, Mt. Gox expanded. At one point, it handled 80% of bitcoin trades. At the Mt. Gox offices, a staff of around 30 handled the requests and questions of customers, which last year reached one million in number.
With the growth came new headaches. The first whiffs of trouble came in May last year. U.S. regulators said the exchange wasn't properly registered in the U.S. In June, Mt. Gox registered there as a money-services business.
People close to Mt. Gox say that throughout the recent turmoil, Mr. Karpelès was stressed but tried to protect employees. He hasn't responded to repeated requests by The Wall Street Journal for comment since the Feb. 17 email interview.
On Feb. 7, Mt. Gox halted withdrawals, blaming a technical glitch. Two weeks later, the exchange had become synonymous with the risks associated with a virtual currency. Some investors recounted losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Executives in the wider bitcoin community took pains to separate Mt. Gox's issues from the industry as a whole.
In a YouTube video posted Wednesday, Roger Ver, a Tokyo bitcoin entrepreneur, said the issue was caused in part by "poor programming skills" on the part of Mt. Gox." A flaw in the software used by all bitcoin exchanges potentially made possible fraudulent withdrawals. Other exchanges remain open, but Mt. Gox has had to halt operations.
Mr. Ver, who helps connect players in the bitcoin community and has known people at Mt. Gox for several years, spoke bluntly, saying the bitcoin turmoil "was caused by a single mismanaged company, not by any problem with bitcoin itself." The entrepreneur confirmed his remarks in the YouTube video to The Wall Street Journal.
As for Magical Tux, his last Twitter post was on Jan. 12. It was a response to a customer complaint about web-hosting services provided by Tibanne, the company that operates Mt. Gox.

I don't need to make a claim. You said you didn't own anything so I don't need to justify my claim over it. I can come to your location and extract your eyeball if that helps.




Because you are behaving like your eyeball is your property, yet denying you can own property. There is a contradiction there.


Because you said you didn't own them. You cannot stop me taking your eyeball because you have no claim over it.


No. I'm just saying I want your eyeball. Surely, you would have no issue with this since you do not own it.


Indeed. It would lead to a silly situation. Thus confirming self-ownership and property rights are essential.
Try taking an animal's prey, going into their territory, trying to mate with their mate or removing their eyeball. Even animals understand property rights.

Japan has a 99% conviction rate. They managed to get 5 people to confess to sending death threats when it was later proven someone else had set them up. I wouldn't put anything past them.


True, but Dotcom wasn't holding customer funds as such - only providing a service. I think there's a distinction there.

Market cap is just a rough estimate of the value of stocks/btc.
If someone tried to buy every bitcoin, they would need more than 1 Trillion. If someone tried to sell every bitcoin they would get a lot less than 1 Trillion. 
So 1 Trillion is a good ballpark market cap and it is susceptible to change significantly depending on minor cash injections or withdrawals.

Until John Betts releases his final plan - it's hard to fully evaluate savegox. However here is what I see not working in their favor:
* Spreading FUD about liquidation % and cost of lawyers.
* Original proposal had 1-year-btc-lockdown (+backtracking from original proposal due to bad PR).
[Personal attacks]
* Holmquist seems too young and brash (see IRC chats) to manage PR
* Betts talks in vague corporate speak
* Roger Ver is backing savegox which totally fucked people over (including myself) when he vouched for MtGox back in the summer of 2013 - and I should've known better than to listen to him.
I'm with AnarchyStar here. I don't trust anyone, including OKCoin. I just know that I want my funds back and I want blood, preferably Karpeles'. He and his team need to be jailed for this.

I think we have a different definition of government. What do you mean by government?
I understand that a person or group of people give themselves the right to initiate force. Therefore if this is a 2 person world, they do not 'govern' the land together - because one person only has the monopoly on the use of force and the other doesn't. Otherwise, there is no government.

Then you write:


so one would think there would be little to gain by joining the website, except having more influence over the proceedings/decisions - which might turn out to be crucial.


So it appears that not all (unsecured) creditors are treated equally. **The gamble with joining the Mtgoxrecovery lawsuit is that one could be lumped into a different class of creditors to increase one's percentage of recovered funds - whilst hoping this will overcome the 20% fee of the Mtgoxrecovery lawsuit.**
A/ Can you make a case that the odds of recovery the most money are greater by joining the Mtgoxrecovery lawsuit?
B/ I'm also wondering if liquidation also treats creditors differently.
C/ Why is the law firm getting paid 10% of the recovered funds along with hourly rates? Shouldn't they be working on contingency only or none at all?
D/ If you sign up enough claimants, 20% of the recovered funds might be a millions of dollars. I know lawyers are pricey. but these seems like a lot of money for what is so far an unclear ROI.

Just a PR stunt in my opinion. To counter the anti-TOR stance of the Russians.

The Japanese police get most people to confess, as they can keep you locked up for 23 days for trumped up charges. Then after 23 days, they come up with a modified version of trumped up charges - and so on, until you confess.
A Japanese hacker sent death threats from other people's computer. The hacked victims were arrested and both confessed to making the threat even though they were innocent:  . If the Japanese want Karpeles to admit guilt, it should be a ride in the park for them as it seems common practice there.

Wrong. Some have evidence of their claims, others do not. 
Their cases can be put forth with evidence. It is not a matter of wills. If the majority of people think the earth is flat, it does not make it so. If the majority of people think that you are an apple, it does not make it so. They need to prove their case with reason and evidence. Same goes with ownership.




Of course there are definite ways to determine property ownership. If I build a car with my own parts on my own time, it is my car. Nobody else can make a rightful claim on it. It doesn't matter how "big enough group of people" think they should own it instead of me, their have no evidence to prove their ownership. I don't need a government for that.
You only need a government if others gang up on me and use the government to extort that car from me through force. Why can you not see the difference?






Your argument has nothing to do with logic, reason, evidence nor ethics. Your stance is that if someone or a group uses force to claim they own something you do, than that is fine. Might does not make right. A rightful claim can be backed by argument and evidence. You are arguing that this doesn't matter - that only force does. Yes, I can beat you and take your stuff but nobody would argue I now have a more valid claim to your stuff. That is not how civilized people function. Comon!




No it's not because you cannot point to anywhere where they say it. It would show that the government is just a bunch of bullies.


With copyrights laws, you are subject to their laws even outside the country.


Ok, so if the North Korea invades the US tomorrow. Then would you still be defending the NK imposing their laws on the US citizens? After all, the NK now own the US and all its land. People owe them taxes.


If they got hold of you, they would shoot you for desertion. How can you defend this? It is a natural extension of the government claiming they own you.
The government can (and has) turned around and drafted entire generations into war. One's only option was to escape, leave their families, jobs friends and life and face the death penalty. 
I don't understand why statists like yourself defend this. 


Why is it illegitimate? The government says it owns your labor (taxes), your land (taxes), your future children (public debt) and they can tell what rules to obey. Seems like ownership to me. 
In the US, the IRS still claim ownership of your labor once you have left the country. So yes, they own you.
Yet it is a system you defend.


No it is not. If it was it would not require force to raise taxes. Just like Walmart does not need armies to force people to buy in their stores. **Everything the government does is by definition not what people want** because they use force.
Why do you know is something is sex or rape? Because in one case somebody has got a knife to the throat.
I and many others do not support the government. So there is your exception right here. The government does not have full support.
I am not a part owner of the country. I cannot sell my share of the country. I cannot point to a specific land of the country that is mine. There is no ownership contract/agreement. I cannot voluntarily choose to exit this agreement (see IRS).
If you believe you have the same control of government property than the government agents do, you are deluded. Try to build a house on the white house lawn. See how much a co-owner you are. 


But you defend this system. The same system of majority that democratically elected Hitler to power. You do know everything Hitler did was legal right? So you have no problem with this? "It was the will of the majority" after all.


Ok, so on one side you say I can leave. On the other side, you say there is no place under the control of a government. So what do you mean by I can leave? There are governments covering the entire earth's surface and now you say that even the seas are under their control.


Omitting your previous comment. If a group of people homestead an unknown uncharted island. Would you defend their legitimacy in torturing me since it is **their land** and their majority will?


That's not true. There were vast areas of land throughout human history that were not owned by governments. Governments have only been around for a couple of centuries, monarchies before that. See Africa, South america, North America etc...


If a country invades another, it does not magical now have a valid ownership claim over it.
If me and my gang invade your house, can we now legitimately claim it is ours and do as we please with? After all, we are in the majority.


It is not. Open a history book and see for yourself. Countries are formed by warlords taking vast expanses of land (already owned by its inhabitants) and claiming ownership over. There is nothing voluntary about it. Nobody asked their opinions.


Because they got crushed by the gangs that then claimed their land. If they didn't pay the gang's protection money (taxes), they would have died. They had no choice.

No matter how you define the social contract, you cannot force me to accept it at the end of a gun. I respect you ability to form a social contract with you and other people, just don't force me into it. Why is that so offensive to you?


You cannot. It would be like debating your preference for chocolate or for the color green. It's completely subjective and pointless. Only a universal standard of truth warrants a debate. Do you think physics, maths or any science has any truth? 0+0=1 ? Is that subjective too? Why are you arguing for government then? 
If there is no absolute truth, how can your statement that all truths are relative be meaningful because that is an absolute truth in of itself? See: self-detonating statement right there.

Neither is the USA. The US is more similar to state-planned economy than anything else.


It was. Many people lived in squalor and died because of it. Thankfully, it's becoming more capitalist than most Western nations in terms of business.


My point is that many countries have gone into oblivion whilst the "entire government and business community, people who have spend their entire lives studying the financial system" in many cultures/countries stood by and helped it along. The US is no different.


I could point you to the Weirmar republic hyper-inflation, the French assignats, Japanese asset bubble, etc etc... 


No, it's very simple really: respect for property rights and the non-aggression principal. If you don't respect these, then your society will self-destruct. The Banks bankroll the state, that regulates the banks, that funds academia and bailouts the banks. so I don't see you'd think either of them would work against another.

If you want to offload some of the dispute resolution work, let people register with your site as dispute agents. Each agent can have an ebay-like feedback page, their fee structure (per hour, per case, percentage transaction total etc), max turn-around time, means of contact and what they specialize in.
Your customers would choose which agent they prefer to use depending on their rating and costs. If for some reason, both parties of a transaction don't like the agent's decision then they can switch to another agent.
Make the service free (since it should be all automated). Only get paid when there is a dispute and take a percentage on the agent fees. This will push people to use your service as a no brainer.
Agents could have verified status or anonymous. This would help you leverage third world agents who will charge small fees and their feedback page will inform your customers as to the quality of their service. Means you could do disputes in multiple languages.
Not sure if you need a state license since 1/ you're not dealing with real money 2/ You are not actually doing the dispute resolution, your agents are.

It's a privacy nightmare, just like RFID passports. Hackers can scan them at a distance. You don't really know the amount charged. Someone can steal your card and use it without your pin. There is really little advantage to PINs except to provide less security and more incentive for people to abandon cash which the IRS/HMRC would love.


Where are you getting this from? Check Authorize.net and other payment processor, even for huge transaction volumes, the fees are non-negligible. Plus big users like Adsa represent only a subset of all merchants.
There is also huge liabilities and compliance costs, and massive fraud associated with credit card. I'm familiar with the industry and the share taken by card operator is insane especially compared to the thin margins of most big merchants like Asda.


There are currently fees to buying bitcoins today, but this is mostly because of the legacy banking system. 
You forget all the hidden fees your currency has which is passed on to you by the government via taxes/inflation. Printing bank notes, issuing bonds etc... all have massive costs. 
bitpay will be offering 0% Transaction Fees this month... and if you stay in bitcoin 100% there are no fees apart from negligible transaction fees.
You have to compare what is comparable: going in-and-out of bitcoin&lt;-&gt;fiat versus doing transactions within that currency be it fiat or bitcoin.


Lucky you, until it doesn't. Many horror stories with DD.


Not if you stay in bitcoin. It is unbeatable that way. You should compare it more to doing an international transfer from one fiat currency to another. This is more valid.


Why? Because you can't see the real cost of a fiat currency?

There is no social contract with Bitcoin and its users, as Bitcoin is a protocol and its users are the ones who choose or not to adopt changes in the protocol.
And the social contract in itself is a fallacious notion created by statist to justify theft through taxation. But that's another discussion.

How can it be moral to initiate force against someone? It doesn't matter how many agree with it, it is still not logically consistent. It does not matter how many people agree with gravity, gravity applies nonetheless. The same with moral rules. They apply to everyone consistently or they do not. 


It does not matter who owned slaves or who was a slave. "We" was fine with it at the time. It was legal.

Forcing people at gunpoint to pay taxes or granting monopolies does not enable social mobility. As I said, rule of law does not imply a state.


One cannot issue debt on the unborn without the monopoly on force - which is the definition of the state. No other entity can do this. Debt on the unborn is one of many effects of the state.


Let me guess, you are european right?


Irrelevant. It is not because stealing is immoral that it cannot happen.


Some people think the earth is flat. Doesn't make them correct.


The social contract solves nothing. If people want to steal, this "contract" doesn't stop them as can be seen everyday.


The lesser of two evils, is still evil. At least you are honest in stating you support evil i.e. the state.


So you're a relativist. I'm not clear why you are debating me or anyone about anything if there is no truth. Makes no sense according to your perspective. 
You really need to read Molyneux's book. You will thank me for it.


Not exactly. Here is an excerpt from Moylneux's book  :
Any moral theory proposing that “stealing is good” is also automatically invalid because it posits that property rights are both valid and invalid at the same time, and so fails the test of logical consistency. If I steal from you, I am saying that your property rights are invalid. However, I want to keep what I am stealing – and therefore I am saying that my property rights are valid. However, property rights cannot be both valid and invalid at the same time, and so this proposition itself must be invalid.
Similarly, any moral theory that advocates rape faces a similar contradiction. Rape can never be moral, since any principle that approves it automatically contradicts itself. If rape is justified on the principle that “taking pleasure is always good,” then such a principle immediately fails the test of logical consistency, since the rapist may be “taking pleasure,” but his victim certainly is not. (The same goes, of course, for murder and assault. ) 
I would recommend reading Molyneux's books, including  Everyday Anarchy and Practical Anarchy. These books are realy simple to read and will answer all your questions about how a ruler-less non-violent society can function. I can't do it justice in Reddit comments.

But you cannot have rent-seeking without the state, which is by its very nature a rent-seeking entity itself.


So if you lived on a desert island with one other person, you would not own your clothes because there is no state? You don't need a state to have property. Also, the state violates your property (forced taxation) in order to 'protect' which makes no sense.


Of course it is based on force. You protect your property. If you do not, you die (food, clothing, shelter). The state doesn't change that either - it just steals it from you.


A state is a monopoly on force in a geographical area. It is a dictatorship by its very nature. If you disagree with it and do not comply, you die.


What you are describing is decentralized free-market stateless societal model. Why do you support the state then?


If you want to spend your money on what you think is the "common good" then go ahead. Just don't force others into it.


If people want it, then you can make money off it. If people don't want to tackle environment problems then you cannot make money off it. Simple no?

And these things existed and exist before and during governments. Your point?


You are actually criticizing the state that you support by saying this. Because currently we do not have the law of man, we have the law of nature because the government imposes its will by force. The statist system is the rule of the strongest.
Get past the statist propaganda and ask yourself why you are unable to see this. It's so simple really: 
Is it moral for me to steal (tax) from someone by force? No. 
Is it moral for anyone else to do so? No. 
Is it moral for a group of people to do so? No. 
Is it moral for a group of people supported by other people to do so? No.

Not exactly. Check out this article on the new law: 
The law is mostly meant to apply to existing electronic money initiative Moneo and gift/prepaid cards, but I guess can apply to Bitcoin. The law actually removes the monopoly that banks have on the issue of electronic currency and defines which permits/fees they need to follow. Apparently they need 350K euros minimum capital (which is less than the 5million euros on deposit banks, but more than the 20-125K euros for "payment establishments").
It also states that if the total electronic money issued by the entity is less than 5million euros overall, and that the distributed denominations are &lt;250 euros, then you don't need to apply for a special permit.
This applies mostly to gift cards. Not sure how that applies to Bitcoin since its total value is over 5million euros but it is not issued by any specific entity such as the one located in France, and the denominations of bitcoin can be as big as $115 (i.e. 1 BTC) and as small a 1 Satoshi ... " la monnaie embarquée sur ses supports est inférieure à 250 euros".
It does not seem to apply to individuals either.

Don't need a source it's evident by the fact the investors own 20% of all the XRP. If they are not a currency i.e. worthless, then there is no point in owning them. Plus, every transaction on ripple as far as I understand is converted to XRPs as a go between (could be wrong).

Using fractional bitcoins has nothing to do with inflating the number of bitcoins. When you divide a bitcoin/dollar it does not dilute the value of other bitcoins/dollars like fiat inflation does. So no, you're talking out of your bottom again.


There is no speed or cost associated with using fractional bitcoin since it is built in.
Fractional bitcoin is not the sole advantage of bitcoin. 


Probably? Using fractional bitcoins costs nothing. Redenomination is only in your head so there is no market responsiveness because it exists if you believe it does. It's up to each individual which units they want to deal with.

Is it moral for a group of us to force another person to give me money (taxes) for services we judge necessary? No.
Is it moral for a billion people to force another person to give me money (taxes) for service they judge necessary? No.
The answer is always no. The collective (which derives its rights from the individual) has no more rights than the individual, therefore it does not have inverse moral rules.

You don't get it. The government doesn't ask for taxes, it demands them at the barrel of a gun.  No matter how rational or irrational their explanation is. There's nothing voluntary about it. What they do with the money afterwards is irrelevant.
By the way, there is nothing rational about the social contract because it's not a contract (you seen it? if so where are the terms? can I not sign it? what are the obligations of each party? what recourse does it have? What if one party fails on their end, then what grievances are there?).

The author is trying to promote its own version of Bitcoin, called Bitmint. The fact that it is centralized, means it is more likely to go the way of other failed digital cash initiatives before it such as egold/digicash - except if it is official sanctioned. But in that case, it is no different to national fiat currencies which are already mostly digital. 
Of course, the author is aware that his alternative cannot compete with Bitcoin as it would "reign, suck in an enormous amount of wealth" therefore he suggests "Bitcoin should be disqualified as a functional tradable currency" because he is aware no one would voluntarily opt for his digital currency. If Bitmint or Mintchip (Canadian central bank's project) are worthwhile, why not let it compete on the free market?
He also criticizes that Bitcoin relies on cryptography and therefore will be broken. Bitmint, the entire banking industry and military also use cryptography, so the issue does not only apply to Bitcoin and would have a much bigger societal impact. In any case, bitcoin's protocol is evolving constantly, so any advances in cryptographic hash functions can be incorporated.
"Bitcoin will [...] eventually implode, unleashing a financial tsunami of unimagined proportions." The author does not explain why it will.
Bitcoin is not a "rogue alternatives". It is just a currency that people are voluntarily trading with. If they choose not to follow the Fed's guidance, then let them have it. It is the "Fed's guidance" that has overseen a 98% reduction in the purchasing power of the USD and countless crashes since its creation.

This would open up so many new markets for Paypal. 
Like Argentina for example where they had to stop operating. It would mean anyone in the world could buy from eBay, or from online retailers offering paypal.
It appears Paypal is trying to muscle into bit-pay's space. Jeff Jordan, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who are one of the VCs behind bit-pay, was the president of Paypal from 2004-06. Jeff knows Paypal's market so this is a big red flag for Paypal. 
Paypal's response was to signal they also want to embrace Bitcoin - maybe to appease potential stockholder concerns of Paypal's future.

I'm not sure that is entirely the case for the US, since the Fed is lending to Treasury. The country is effectively lending to itself.


Given that part of that debt is owned by foreigners, it matters a lot. Foreign creditors will stop buying US debt, and worse they will sale their bonds. Causing a bond collapse. Meaning the country cannot borrow anymore, except from itself.
Japan has a much more insular public debt where the majority of the debt is owned internally by the pension funds. When the circle-jerk ceases, the pensioners will be left with no retirement.


That's just semantics. If the country inflates the currency to toilet paper status, that is essentially the same as bankruptcy.


Then why not have a bazillion $ national debt? I mean it doesn't matter right? Let's pave the streets with gold. It will create jobs. Let's blow everything up and rebuild everything. It will grow the GDP!
Try convincing your banker that your debts don't matter.
