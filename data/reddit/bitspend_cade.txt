Thanks for your post, however, we are closed over the weekend. In addition, the only communication I have received from you, is the email which I am about to respond to. I'm terribly sorry about this shadowbanning stuff.

Hypo, is there still an issue? I was certain I had resolved it!

Hey Sled!
Indeed it does seem like a perfect storm, and I'm terribly sorry about it!


@_date: 2013-06-11 13:03:04
Absolutely! I'm glad we got this taken care of!
Absolutely, we are always open to criticism and comments!


Is the case. If you look on our sidebar, and on our website, those are the times we follow. We shortened our hours recently, and apparently the automated email system wasn't updated with the change. This is being fixed as we speak.


In response to this, reddit surfing on Sunday is a personal thing. I find that when dealing with large numbers of bitcoins, in an environment where many have already been scammed or off-put by previous services. simply keeping open communication is enough to set their minds at rest. Even if I'm simply replying with a "wait until Monday morning", it shows that their issue is still on our radar.


I will do my best! Our support software at Freshdesk was down from last wednseday, which would explain why those emails were never received.
On Friday at 6:10PM EST we received your first email saying this: 


This email was not replied to, again because of our hours of operation, which are 9-5PM EST. After that, we received 4 emails titled SUPPORT, which were actually 2 sets of 2 emails to two separate email accounts. Both of these were received Saturday or Sunday, again, when we were closed.


I do not. TBQH, the first time I've even heard of shadowbanning was in your post to &gt; And lastly: I plan to choose a different (more reliable) email provider soon. Would you be willing to provide this service for me again sometime, via email (without phone)?
Of course we would! It was a misunderstanding on my part, I didn't realize that you didn't want to have to use a phone call! Now that our expectations for our hours of support are set, I expect our next transaction to go much smoother!
