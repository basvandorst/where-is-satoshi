Same here. Buying a little BTC every week.

People were mining Bitcoin when it was worth less than 1 dollar.  
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:20:52
Yeah, strange things like that can happen in crypto.
I saved 40.000 dollars in Bitcoin, then one day I spent 1000 dollars just for fun, and I still have 1.1 million dollars left.

I think it's best to buy small amounts of Bitcoin regularly for an amount of fiat money you decide, no matter what the price of BTC is. Something like 100 dollars a week.

Hahaha, hilarious. I have been following the scaling debate from the very start, so why don't you crawl back into your rbtc hole, where the *real* mob lives (together with Roger's voting bots and sockpuppets).

But Bcash did fork already. That's why there is now the fake DAA Bcash and Bitcoin Clashic, which is the original EDA vision of Bcash. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:49:25
That comparison makes absolutely no sense in this context.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:32:15
I don't hate him. But it's a fact that he is promoting Bcash, a fake Chinese copy of Bitcoin.

Aww, poor company getting "harassed". Dude. It's a scam company.
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:34:50
congratulations! you now own 100 million satoshis! :D

And that‘s why you always keep your bitcoins. You don’t gamble and you don’t give them to shitcoin scammers. Be careful out there, a lot of people will want to own your bitcoins. HODL.

I’ve seen the early signs of a religious Bcash cult for a while now

So the fact that Craig Wright provided fake crptographic proof did not worry Roger Ver. But the fact that Craig doesn‘t like Roger anymore now makes him skeptical. Can‘t be Satoshi then.
And that‘s why Roger Ver can‘t be trusted, He is a narcissist and doesn‘t understand the technology.

Saving is what gives money value.
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:37:23
It's part of the combined B2X/BCH attack plan against Bitcoin. Read this:

This is so true. A dollar used to be an ounce of silver. Now the dollar is just a shitcoin worth less than a bag of plastic toy money.

Hello. I think it's great you are thinking about saving some Bitcoins. I believe they will appreciate in value a lot and you will be very happy about the investment ten years from now. 1 bitcoin is 100 million satoshis, or 1 million bits with 1 bit being 100 satoshis. Buy the dips. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Always store your bitcoins in a wallet that you control the private keys for, don't leave coins at an exchange website! Good wallets for PCs are Electrum and Greenaddress. On a smartphone, use Bread (iOS), Mycelium (Android) or Greenaddress (Android, iOS). If you want to be super safe, use a hardware wallet such as the Trezor

It’s a network and a protocol for the instant p2p transfer of value  - I feel really sorry for Buffet and everyone who does not see the value in that. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:38:48
Yeah, you're right. Probably no reason to feel sorry for him.

Bitcoin dot com is a scam website, trying to lure newbies into their fake „Bitcoin“ Cash (BCH, Bcash).

No private company „can do whatever it wants“. There are these things called laws, you know.

It‘s okay on Android but crap on iOS. And both versions still don‘t support Segwit. I recommend Samourai.
