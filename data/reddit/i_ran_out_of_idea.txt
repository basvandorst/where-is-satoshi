Only do it if it’s money you don’t need. You are going to make some nice money when the pound value drops then you will be tempted to hold on to it and by the looks of it, bitcoins won’t make a break for another 2-3 years.
Also, ignore the idiot below me who commented “gold”, just go look up gold and read up and you can see it’s only good at keeping the value of your money, there will be no gain, still some risk.
With bitcoin, you have huge risk and huge gains but the risks will be very limited if you are using your own money and the money you DON’T need right now or for the next few years.

If you are from the UK, you should have already converted all your money to bitcoin 2 years ago. In a few months time, you can exchange $1 for £10.

I hope it slows down a little bit if it goes up too fast, it's going to crash hard.

Wait until we hit $5K and we get all them trashy articles again.

That’s the best and safest around. Nobody knows you have it, unlike everything else.

Hell yeah, we don’t care though, do we? We gonna be around for another 5 years then sell. I made my peace when it dropped to $2K.

Don't forget, after credit, our pound is going to drop even further and possibly end up being the same value as dollar. We get to double dip ��.

It's crazy, I can't go to bed man ��. It’s 6AM here in the UK.
