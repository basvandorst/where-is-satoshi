mine keeps crashing :(
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:22:38
Aw man I thought that meant i got one. Oh well. I manage to get in within the top 90,000 lol so maybe soon.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:22:53
Sad thing is I see this IRL with middle age men. Specifically with Litecoin for some reason.

I click to go to the crypto page and it opens it up for a split second then crashes right away.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:04:34
Yep. I find these posts more annoying than the joke posts.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:59:20
Fake news.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:02:15
Maybe they are doing both.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:56:46
Well then tell her to use something other than coinbase!
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:26:44
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:02:22
Then please support your argument. Saying "NUH UH! UR LYING" is not helping your case.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:55:48
I'm sorry but this is terrible way to calculate this.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:05:25


    
You're god damned right I am.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:07:42
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:07:44
Yep. Do this first. Pay off or minimize loans/debt. Then get into crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:05:40
So I have a small amount of BTC on a paper wallet from before the fork. Does that mean I now own that same amount in BTC and BCH? or do I just pick one or the other?
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:02:23
Yep. OP seemed to forget about this. The halving will be a big factor in price in 3 years.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:13:52
YOU WILL NEVER GET THIS!
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:24:03
Oh hell yeah. Not much free money lol but I can't complain.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:58:23
Same. Those were some good times.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:00:36
The halvening is also in 3 years so that will be a big factor as well.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:39:01

I too like World of Warcraft.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:53:24


No doubt. By the end of labor day I will be surprised if we don't reach or exceed 5K.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:41:44
I know. Also I've never played world of warcraft in my life lol. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:26:43
Isn't it just the exchange that is closing and not the mining pool? No one really used that exchange anyways so I don't think this will have a huge effect on BCH.
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:18:33
We have one of these even in wichita fucking kansas of all places. The markup on them is crazy though.

Just use both and move on and don't read these subreddits. I rage at the cancer every time I come back.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:15:34
So we're all going to act like children about it.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:21:25
Unfortunately you're only going to get VERY biased opinions on any crypto subreddit. Do your research outside of reddit. These subreddits are nothing but toxic and cancerous. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:14:23
Yep. You'd think mature discussion would be common place. Apparently we are not allowed to do that.
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:35:34
Whitepaper plz

Try these two articles:
      
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:00:47
I just feel iffy about giving them my SSN and my ID.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:40:50
Yep. I'm done with coinbase after this.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:19:26
I'm trying to buy more coin to hodl.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:41:55
Pulling all of my coins out after it comes back and never using it again. Anyone recommend an alternate site?
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:29:35


     
money bags over here.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:12:46

@_date: 2017-06-15 17:15:45
