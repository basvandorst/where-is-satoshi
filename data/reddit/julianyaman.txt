You make very much money for them. Where is the problem?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:15:45
Is there any date when this system will be used? Because I think now would be a good time to change something.

Actually I would like if cryptocurrencies could get a better image when mining companies are using renewable energy sources.
So it will look more future-prepared and gives a good example for other companies though they may doing something else than mining.

Actually if you need help in your situation, this subreddit is maybe the wrong place. Your situation has actually nothing to do with this subreddit. You just wrote it here because it has something to do with Bitcoin.

Good to hear that. 20$ fee for one transaction is really annoying.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:18:20
Does 'soon' mean later this year or next year?
I want to know that before buying any BTC because why should I have them now if I can actually do nothing with them without paying an extremely high fee.

Really interesting article but I think that this huge rise of Bitcoin will come to an end. I don´t mean that it will crash. I mean it will still rise but not in this speed like we see in the last months. 
I´m expecting that Bitcoin will come to at least 20k $ at the end of 2018.

Mining should not only depend on how the energy comes but how much it could cost to install for example a solar array on the top of a mining hall and if it produces enough.
I do like renewable energy and it would be very good if mining of cryptocurrencies use it but like everything else in life, everything costs something.

There is always a reason and your post don't seem like it is believable.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:48:42
I still don't understand your circumstances. 
You traded with crypto currency and you were able to get a high amount of money but your community wants more... 
Can you not only say to them that you are not able to give them so much.
On this subreddit, noone can actually give you an answer to your situation because it won't help much since this subreddit is only about talking about BTC and not about life situations.
A crypto currency trader won't help you much or can't help you. I think you must decide for yourself what to do next.
And yes, for the 1000th time, 10000$ is very much money.

BitPay is a very good app where you can receive payments.
Basically it is only a wallet but you could search for an online wallet which synchronise with the mobile and desktop (web) application.
So you must decide if you want to have different wallets or that you 'synchronise' your wallet on your mobile app with taking payments on your mobile and then import this wallet to a desktop wallet (maybe the same wallet app like BitPay) by typing your seed in the wallet to import it.
It is not a real synchronisation but you would have your BTC on both devices.

Dude stop posting the same thing again and again.

I heard that Changelly is a scam but I don't know if this is true but maybe they are not legit as it look like.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:20:54
Thank you for sending this link. Hope that this become reality as soon as possible!
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:12:11
What would this look like in reality?
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:10:54
There are hard forks like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold but you must not be concerned about something because Bitcoin will stay as Bitcoin. You´re able to exchange your bitcoins into the new hard fork currencies but you needn´t. And you can see, the price of Bitcoin is still rising.

Would also recommend Electrum because it´s simple, safe and open-source.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:42:58
I don't understand this too. ��
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:24:54
I guess it would stay at the same price level with only minor changes (+/- some dollars).
But you should have in mind that this critical mass will likely never be reached.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:45:45
So actually the block size dropped. So there you can see it is actually downloading the blocks but it just need time.
Like I said, it depends on your computer system and it majorly depends on your connection speed.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:49:39
I think a page was hacked where you can pay with Bitcoin but the receiving address was replaced with the hackers one.
Or it is this malware thing where people have a virus on their PC and when they do a transaction, the address will be replaced with the hackers one without that you notice anything.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:31:45
This is a factor which I didn´t calculate in.
If there are more people who are selling and buying with Bitcoin, the price would rise.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:10:37
So actually it only shows that it needs 2 years but in reality, it just needs some hours to download the whole blockchain. I don´t really understand why it does show that it shows the same on my computer too but like I said it only needs some hours depending on your internet connection speed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:17:18
It is smart to accept Bitcoin as a payment method since Bitcoin becomes more and more popular. It would be a smart step doing it now and to be prepared for the future but I don´t think that you will get more money with allowing it as a method but you would help people who have bitcoins and want to buy something.
At the end, it is your decision.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:47:04
I don't like it when it is going to drop...
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:25:48
Wow, so in 5 years and with a growth like this, they are going to be super-billionaires or close to trillionaires?
I think when this will happen, nobody will say anything against Bitcoin and it will have a worldwide impact on the view on Bitcoin as a daily life currency like any currency currently.
But before this happens, I think Bitcoin will not have a big growth like this for the next months. Its value will rise but not in this significant speed.
