That's not true AT ALL Andreas.  Maybe you are not aware of it.  Go to  on Freenode.  I have had direct conversations with the core developers there.  Gmaxwell dislikes you very much and talks a lot of shit about you.  I'm not sure which one he is.  
Having said that, I think you are good for bitcoin.  Perhaps you're not as talented as the core developers BUT you are FAR, FAR better at promotion and if anyone thinks bitcoin doesn't need promotion, they're god damn idiots.

WTF...do you know how reddit works dick face?  I've been a redditor for fucking years.  I just choose to use a throwaway to avoid any backlash asshole.  You're the dick trying to take down someone that has promoted bitcoin positively more than anyone else.
It should be obvious to anyone that you have it out for Andreas based solely on the way you framed your supposed security bug announcement here.

This bug isn't critical at all.  The ass hat that started all this shit is just trying to discredit Andreas. 
Basically the bug makes customers using the api think they have received funds they may not have received IF they only use the api to check balances. 
I think the ass clown responded to you below though.

It's...uhh...still up dick head.  We'll see in time.  
Honestly, I could give a shit less if you found a real bug.  You went about this COMPLETELY wrong.  You're just another asshole that doesn't like Andreas or for that matter probably bitcoin itself.  Hell, I doubt you're the one that even found the bug.

The proof is in the pattern.  Look at what you titled this post.  If you're not associated with them, you're in lockstep with them in your hatred towards Andreas.

Who is gmaxwell?   This guy talks a LOT of shit about you on 
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:20:34
At this point, NO ONE BELIEVES YOU.  You would have to take advantage of the exploit and PROVE YOU DID.  Then give the money back.
Since you REFUSE to do this, you likely don't have shit as this would be EXTREMELY acceptable to anyone.
I bet Andreas is right and this is just some medium security bug where no funds can be altered.  
If not, step up bitch and prove it.  THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.  You won't even take 2 dollars worth of bitcoin to prove you were correct.  You'll throw up excuse after excuse for NOT doing it but the truth is YOU AINT GOT SHIT.

WOW...this is something I don't understand!
ELI5 please.

Clearly you care.

Looks like it's 100K to get a license.  Let the fleecing begin.

I ABSOLUTELY AGREE with you.  It IS true though.  I don't understand the reasons.
Personally I think there is some jealousy going on there also possibly a bit of a circlejerk tendency in that channel where it's pretty much an echo chamber for their own thoughts.

Here's what's really going on:  The core developers of bitcoin are attempting to harass and discredit Andreas.  Apparently some bad blood went down between them months ago with Andreas supposedly trying to get one of them fired.
Like the whiny bitches they are, the core developers have not forgotten or forgiven this.  We can all expect them to come in here and discredit Andreas as much as they can even though they never do ANYTHING to promote bitcoin themselves.   Also, to boot, they HATE because people are allowed to form their own opinions here--these guys have MAJOR ego problems unfortunately.
These social idiots would rather bitcoin fail than put the past behind them.

NO ONE CAN FUCKING EMPTY SHIT WITH THIS BUG!!!!!!!  All they can do is trick companies into giving them free shit.  OH MY GOD!
This dipshit is an ASSCLOWN!
