In India, your friends can certainly use zebpay. Zebpay is available on Android and iPhone. To cash out, they need to complete simple verification,  sell bitcoin and they will receive funds in their bank account within one working day, normally within few hours.

Thanks for feedback and pointers, we will surely look into it.

Hi mate,
Mahin here. Actually there was no Fema or any other violation as reported in many news sources. They searched our offices on to find out what is happening as it was a lot of media hype around the globe that time due to craze rally from 300$ to 1200$ and central banks were issuing warnings. There was never any charge or anything on us :) 
And yes Buysellbitco.in is relaunched as zebpay :)
@_date: 2015-05-23 03:50:39
Bitcoin, never a dull momnet :)

I asked Google and they said they are talking with Uber and Apple about asking it to Facebook and Microsoft.
@_date: 2015-07-09 07:07:27
No, this is not legit.
You need Eric to make it legit.
@_date: 2015-07-09 07:12:03
We need more and more customer support guys educated about bitcoin. Looking at things, they are the best point of contact to get bitcoin accepted ?
Can anyone talk with IRS customer support ?
@_date: 2015-07-01 09:21:22
Well, personally if you ask me I want services to charge me straight away fees rather than spread. Wish one day I can have same bitcoin prices in India and USA and the service at both sides charge me happily 0.5% each side. They make money, I save money and everything is cool.
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:11:21
Its a great move by all Indian bitcoin business and in general bitcoiners. I have heard a lot of time argument by people that in India they have to pay premium to buy bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 16:46:01
In illiquid markets mostly players decide spread and in most cases they take advantage of low competition. In India or countries where capital controls are very restrictive you will always find existing players milking absence of competition. 
Just compare transferwise and wire transfers or hi fx and wu. Both are in same business but have very different spreads. 
On mature markets and markets where there is good competition your argument is very valid.

Well in zebpay at the moment it is 16411 inr, Google 16422 inr. Traditionally India always had spread of around 5%. Now it's changing as more players joining. I started India 's first exchange BuySellBitco.in and now I run zebpay. Let me assure you it's getting better in India now. As far as unocoin concerns they are really doing good job.

Hi agdkng,
Nice to meet you. I am Mahin, co founder, Zebpay. 
Zebpay is brokerage and you get same locked in price for qty from 500 INR to 5 lacs INR. If you are bulk trader, you can contact our bulk trading desk for better prices too. This is not possible in exchange where the price will go significantly up due to liquidity issues. You can not compare last trade price as 1 BTC price. Same for selling. Also the price we publish is inclusive all fees and taxes while other exchanges separate fees ( BTCX 1% ) from price. 
We also allow user to set his own price, and we execute that order once price matches requested price. I hope I was able to answer your question.
We appreciate your feedback.
@_date: 2016-10-01 11:51:49
Exchange is surely on our roadmap, but we do not see enough liquidity as of now. One major task we do is setting prices ( price discovery ) which is tough and challenging on illiquid markets. We do not want people to worry about price discovery at this moment. 
Adding a new currency to platform adds lot of challenges in operations in terms of User interface, security, operations. We want to make sure that our existing infrastructure is in place for scale and security. Also since we are brokerage now we will have to manage ETH liquidity as well. So in very near future no. In future, if we have enough demand we are open to it.

Fantastic paper, well researched and to the point. Unbelievable amount of effort and research and gives very neutral perspective on it.

Go India go !!! We need more conferences and meetups in India.

In fact, in the year 2007-2008 it was worst, it was all zero :)

Actually its satire on mainstream media. Post actually emphasize that Bitcoin has been best investment throughout all the years. Mainstream media cherry picks a time frame and start crying because negative news = viewers :)
@_date: 2015-02-17 08:03:52
And obviously mainstream media will say, we are running after tulips, aren't we ? :P
@_date: 2015-02-17 14:20:02
The main stream media is actually what people read. When we see articles in main stream media they say Bitcoin CEO jailed, Billion dollars are robbed from exchange, Bitcoin is being used by criminals and for ransom because negativity gets views. Thats where main stream media is single entity.
