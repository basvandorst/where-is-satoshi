Volume is not relevant to the point i brought up regarding your statement that there is nowhere to spend bitcoin which is untrue.

Bitcoin is accepted as a payment method in more shops, websites,charities than ever before(not to mention openbazaar that just launched) I think the main reason you are not confident about the future of bitcoin is that you don't actually use it and so you fail to understand it's usefulness.

Was this all the bitcoins you had ?  If yes, i think it's pretty crazy to store such a large amount of money in one single address at one location. I have like xx dollar invested in bitcoin, 30% is on a trezor,30% on a ledger and 40% on 2 different paper wallets. I wouldn't sleep at night if i had 180k in one address.
Man i feel for you, hope you can recoup your losses somehow but thats a lot of money.

Bitcoin will become totally anonymous, if it doesn't then something else will replace it. Fungibility/privacy are the most important features, the lack of anonymity today is holding back bitcoin's growth, loads of businesses for example don't want to deal with bitcoin because of this. We don't yet notice the cons of having a traceable bitcoin but wait until they start to censor transactions,blacklist coins,spy on businesse's books,etc..when this happen people will migrate to other stealthier coins ( unless bitcoin improves privacy which i think it will)

There are many things you can buy online with bitcoin, you don't need to buy from your country. Bitcoin is also considered a good store of value because of its limited supply so you can also sit on them if you don't actually need the money right now.

I am not being negative i am being realistic. Also i did not blame you for being negative about bitcoin but for saying that there is nowhere to spend it and that bitcoin is not a currency anymore which is false.
Volume is not relevant because it is a metric that we can't calculate unless we ask every merchant to give a report which won't happen so im not sure why you even bring this up.
At this time there is about 99.99% of listings selling legal stuff so yeah openbazaar is for the good guys indeed. 
Now you say that what is sold is irrelevant so why even bring silkroad into the discussion, the more you speak the less sense you make. keep digging yourself deeper and deeper Lol!!

The darknet economy works because of anonymity, so a fiat/BTC exchange wouldn't be possible since users have to reveal their identity at some point. An altcoins exchange could be workable but really i don't see the point apart from drawing LE's attention

The whole point of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust someone, why create a product where customers need to trust you? 
This could be an interesting idea if using multi-sig but in the current state i don't think many people will pay for this. You can print paperwallet for free and securely in under 5 min at home.

@_date: 2016-04-06 17:59:27
Using a third party service to protect your anonymity is bad practice.
I would connect to an altcoin exchange via tor/vpn ( poloniex for instance) then convert the bitcoins to monero, then withdraw monero to an intermediary monero address i control, then send them back to a different poloniex acc and sell for bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-04-16 03:47:52
I'm gonna be a bit harsh here but i guess criticism is productive. This product does not really educate user about bitcoin, it sends them the wrong message. For example each wallet cost a few dollars and so new users  will probably think that they can only have as many wallets as they can afford when in fact they can have thousands and for free. The other issue relates to address reuse, it is generally not recommanded to reuse address for privacy reason. Another wrong message sent is that you have to wait to receive the wallet ( exactly like you do when you first create a bank account) when in fact you could just print a wallet or download an app in 2 min. The last issue is trust, if customer thinks bitcoin is equal to trusting a company they have received the wrong message and they will  think that they can't create a wallet without a company.I personally wouldn't start a paper wallet business as i don't think the digital aspect of bitcoin is a barrier to adoption ( most thing are digital today, apple pay,tap &amp;  pay,contactless payment ,etc..users like these new tech) but if i had to do a paper wallet business i would just create a very user friendly website where user can create and personnalize their own paper wallet by uploading some pics to have printed on the paper wallet , open source it and find revenue model, it is a lot more powerfull to be able to create as much wallet as you want, almost instantly and 100% securely.That's the education new users needs to have. It is good that you try to bring in new users into bitcoin but i don't think we should do it at the cost of compromising bitcoin's greatest properties. Sorry about the harsh comment, at least i am being honest.

-Do we know how many seed nodes are hardcoded in the protocol?
-What would happen if these nodes are shut down overnight? 
-Do we know IP addresses of seed nodes and how have these IP been chosen in the first place to be hardcoded?
-How big is trafic that goes through these nodes ?  
-I read that seed servers are only required once when starting app for the first time, so does this mean that i do not need these servers seed to connect to other peers after initial set up,this would mean that servers seed  stores IP addresses on their server forever right? 
-Aren't these seed servers effectively database of thousands of bitcoin user's IP addresses? 
-How do these seed servers deal with similar tor IP addresses?
- Can a seed node be a tor node ? are bitcoin's seed servers real IP's or anonymous IP's. Why is it hardcoded into the protocol and is there a limit of how many seed servers the network can have ?
I know that's a lot of question and some may be very silly but i am not very technical guy and this thing has me pretty concerned so i would love if someone can clear this up for me. Anyone feel free to jump in and answer some of these questions.

OP, following quote is yours :)
" Moves to abolish cash work to the advantage of Bitcoin. Those who do not want to hold their savings in bank accounts, bonds or the stock market might consider holding Bitcoin to be a safer and more private alternative."
Basically you summed up perfectly what bitcoin is about yet you seem to be concerned about its future.
When cash is abolished, interest rates negatives, and all transactions spied upon then bitcoin will suddently look like a very attractive solution. Above scenario is inevitable imo, in fact it has already started.
Transferwise is just incomparable with bitcoin, they serve very different purposes.
@_date: 2016-04-14 17:08:15
This is your quote to which i answered 
 "For me, btc was a currency and we used to see many posts on this sub about retailers who took btc, websites were you could spend btc, shops and cafes who took btc, charities that took btc, but there is almost none of that now,  "
You can buy almost anything today with bitcoin, if you actually used bitcoin as a currency you would know that and you wouldn't say there is almost nowhere to spend your coins and that bitcoin is not a currency anymore.
Not sure why volume is relevant here...Also the comment about openbazaar does question your motives behind this whole thread imo
@_date: 2016-04-01 23:54:50
The irony is that she offers altcoins as a solution but none actually  solve bitcoin's problems. If you transfer all bitcoin's traffic over to an altcoin that coin will sooner or later face exactly the same issues.

@_date: 2015-12-24 00:12:35

How can this be the best rate when all exchanges are 10$ higher?

@_date: 2015-12-12 16:39:59
No offence but I don't think you understand exactly how multi-sig works .It is very easy to supply a trustless certificate using multi-signature.
1) Customer pre-order a certificate and provide a public key.
2) Company use pubkey to create a 2/2 multisig.
3) Company send certificate and provide private key to their pubkey

Bitcoin blockchain is far more secure than any other coins so everyone is building on it which in turn gives it more value.
Altcoins are good in that they create competition so ultimately the best currency will win, for now it looks like its going to be bitcoin due to first mover advantage but if btc developement is stuck then something else will replace it.
If you are concern about the valuation of your money you can use tether,nubits or bitusd which have a fixed price.

Openbazaar UI is really great and getting better with each version. All the details have been thought through, only missing things are sorting options and maybe a better search filter.
Shops data distributed on different node is essential though, i was browsing openbazaar and there was so many shops offline , this can ruin user experience i reckon.

Bitcoin needs more advertisement that's it. As someone said if every starbucks customers knew they could save 20% by paying with bitcoin ( fold app) then bitcoin would take over the world. Same goes for amazon discount, imagine a worldwide advertising campain in every major city of the world saying " 30% off amazon when using purse.io", sure this would cost a fortune but bitcoin would be mainstream in a day.
Basically any kind of mainstream use of bitcoin would be it, the price will rise and it will just have a snowball effect everywhere. 
Alternatively you could just wait years and watch bitcoin slowly eating the fiat economy.

You sound like you still have a lot to learn, so i suggest you read more about bitcoin and how it works. I think there are many videos on youtube that are helpful. Printing a paper wallet means printing a public key/private key combination on a paper with a printer through the website i gave you. Before sending your funds make sure you understand how everything works.

Ive had this problem since the first time i've downloaded it a few month ago, then i tried to upgrade with new version each time with no luck. When i open software it says btc price for your selected currency are not available, you currency has been set to btc you can change this in your settings.The following currencies are available ( there are none displayed here) I tried to change currency but i only have bitcoin option in settings.( local currency)
Also I just noticed right now that not all listings say NaN but there are more than 50% that says NaN BTC.

A hardware wallet is virus proof, so you can use it on any infected machine without risk of losing your bitcoins.
Paper wallets are more secure than electrum i would say, so if you don't have the budget to buy a hardware wallet and just want to hold, you can print a paper wallet on  ( make sure to do it offline )

@_date: 2017-01-28 02:30:45
I don't think you can get bitcoin instantly on any website due to verification as credit card is a very risky payment method for bitcoin sellers as it is reversible and bitcoin is not..  On blockchain.info  you can buy with a credit card but you have to wait a bit before you get your coins ( a few hours or days i can't tell for sure as i never used them)
@_date: 2017-01-15 14:59:32
Those 2 things are not comparable because less than 1% of bitcoin users are running a node. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 05:35:43
Basically a bitcoin wallet is just a public key and a matching private key.
On a hardware wallet the private keys are on the device and never leave the device so they are essentially offline.
The difference is mainly usability, electrum is not as secure as a paper wallet but it allows to send a transaction more easily.
A paper wallet is just a bitcoin wallet ( combination of one public key and one private key) The public key is the address you send your money to and the private key is the key used to spend the funds.
Some wallet like breadwallet allow you to import the funds from a paper wallet just by scanning the private key. 
You need to print it offline because viruses need you to be online to receive data from your laptop so if your are offline that data will not be intercepted as long as its not stored on your laptop
To do this go to  right click on the page, then save it. Then turn your internet off, locate file you just saved and open it. Then you just have to generate your wallet and print it while offline.

When I buy bitcoin I don't really think this way. I buy because it simply make sense to own a currency not controlled by government and that has a limited supply.
Some people see bitcoin as a risky investment mainly because it's volatile but if you take volatilty out of the equation, long term it doesn't look very risky. Bitcoin is just a superior money and technology so it's not a matter of if but when.
Of course I often think about the implications if bitcoin were to become a world currency, and I also realize that we are all part of something big but this is not the reason why I buy in the first place, I buy to protect my savings.
@_date: 2017-01-15 11:35:34
Actually, you are the one who put things out of context, paying high fees has nothing to do with the difficulty to run a node or the security of bitcoin.

The scaling debate would be very different if we had working sidechains right now.
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:00:35
So having a third party verify your transactions is as secure as verifying them yourself? Ofc it means something for the security of bitcoin's users.
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:43:56


I don't get this. Sidechains are a very big deal, they would allow anyone to create whatever altcoins they wish while still being bitcoin. This adds enormous value to bitcoin but you say you don't see how it is relevant? Well for one BU could be implemented as a sidechains, so all the BU supporters could effectively have what they want which is bigger blocks.

Supply and demand. Bitcoins are bought and sold on the different exchanges which gives it a market price. 
BTC has many different price depending on where you buy it from. What keeps price difference in check is arbitrage, it's basically traders taking advantage of these disparities.

People trust Trezor because they have a good reputation and have been involved in bitcoin for a long time. Their code is also open source so if you have the skills you can verify that there is no backdoor. I'm sure some people have done it and if there was an issue with their code we would have heard about it.
Their whole reputation is on the line, if some people start to complain that they lost BTC via trezor or that their code is acting suspiciously then the company is doomed.
I share your sentiment though and I think wallets and hardware wallet should all be audited by reputable third party firm. Mainstream users are not going to trust their life savings on a device that's not been audited. This should be standard in crypto.

@_date: 2016-12-04 04:02:44
I hate to say this but blockstream has yet to create a product that is actually usable for the average bitcoiner. That's probably one of the reason some people don't trust them because it's not clear what their product and business model is.

How is the market supposed to grow when people lose 50% of their purchasing power overnight? The price is very important to get new users on board. How about the bitcoin enthousiasts who try to live solely on bitcoin ? if prices drop like this they will give up unless they are very hard core bitcoin. 
People who hold or speculate which you probably are one obviously doesn't care...
A mere $6 million order that can create such drop is the very reason you don't do what the devs are doing currently, mainstream media loves to report on the bad news and i can tell you this XT thing which should have been a non event was all over the mainstream media, so it is not only a mere $6 million, price started to drop at $175 because of the core dev argument
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:06:58

Are bitcoin holdings insured against theft/scams?

@_date: 2015-08-17 23:16:54
you can buy bitcoin with a credit card easily on changetip.com I don't think they require as much info as circle but the limits are low.
virwox also allow to buy btc with a credit card but the fee are hefty
otherwise your best bet is localbitcoins.com , you can find a trader that doesn't require ID i guess and wire him the money
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:56:32
could you describe buying and selling process on the app itself in more details and how will people link their bank account ? how long will it take to complete a buy/sell order?
@_date: 2015-08-07 23:26:16

Bitcoin doesn't need people buying large amount of coins to succeed.What it needs is people being able to buy for pocket change without being asked a ton of personal infos.
Bitcoin's main advantage over traditional payment methods is that a trustless system can prevent ID theft from occuring.
Someone who has tens/hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest in bitcoin might go to a regulated exchange and that's fine there will be plenty but exchanges have to look at the bigger pictures and that's exactly what bitfinex did and it will pay off.
How many times have you backed off from a website because they were asking tons of personal info? Bitcoin is meant to be a frictionless system, the smoother the user experience the more customers these exchanges will get, what bitfinex did is a smart business move imo.
@_date: 2015-08-09 14:43:09

How could XT get 75% hash power if miners have no incentives to run it ( no reward) ?
Maybe we will have to agree to a certain date/time when to upgrade or I'm missing somethin ?
Honest question
@_date: 2015-08-11 01:22:08
I was thinking for example if there was a rule that prevent mining pools from having more than 0.1 % and a system that prevent users to connect to that pool if they have reached that limit, would this be possible? would the incentives work still?
Yes. I was refering to a single location set up, what approx is the hashing power of the biggest currently?
@_date: 2015-08-21 13:44:37
Thanks for all the answers.
My concern is that it sounds a bit complex and not very convenient if people need to front money for their spending, send money to different channels. I mean bitcoin as it is today isn't even user friendly enough for people to use it so my question is; can LN/sidechains be baked in the protocol in a way that's user friendly for the consumer? 
@_date: 2015-08-22 19:55:40
Exactly. It boggles my mind that the community ( the people ) hasn't yet rallied to find a suitable solution. 
I mean it ain't rocket science, 1mb is too conservative, XT is too controversial. 
I know this community has good developers without any hidden agenda, go ahead and ask your community what it wants and create a core version closest to what people want , i guarantee you you will have more support than either of the current options.
I mean did gavin asked you what do you want before launching XT? did you agree to those TorIP blacklist? did the blockstream devs asked you if you want LN and sidechains?if you are OK with 1mb forever? NO because they don't care about you they have their agenda.
Bitcoin is the currency of the people any changes should be done by the people ( not by some "official developers")

@_date: 2016-02-15 11:50:21
This is what i've been saying for months, if you do changes to the protocol don't call it another name. That's the main reason a fork is contentious. I don't know what is it so  difficult to understand about that, people want bigger block yes but they don't want the risk associated with a contentious hard fork. By creating different bitcoin versions, classic devs give the false impression that bitcoin core belongs to core when it doesn't.

Why do these people use illuminati hand sign, creepy.
Wait, actually it kinda makes sense. 
And to the sheeple who don't believe this, just explain to me why politicians, singers and celebrity constantly and regularly uses these signs, is it a game they all play with each other? The most hand sign in a month win a ferrari or? Explain to me because normal people don't do that shit, only deaf people do that.

I agree. If they'd publish the public key the whole world would be able to track them down, that's the beauty of the blockchain so why not give it out? hmm...maybe because it doesn't exist..

How can they know for certain how they got funded without any BTC address? 
I think those who want to attack bitcoin really do not understand it, if the terrorists really had used the blockchain to spend and receive money they would be a lot easier to track down than with paper cash or even gold. This is proof that their problem is not terrorism but bitcoin.

I don't have technical skills to understand satoshi's paper so i doubt i will understand this one.
I was just trying to understand why is this project not being worked on by more developers if it is the future of bitcoin. 
You didn't explain why or what is typically not enough...
As i said i don't have technical expertise but coinbase ceo seems to be a bit worried about bitcoin scalability so i'd like to think that these companies want bitcoin to scale don't they?

There's no debating because they got the title wrong. Bitcoin is not anonymous, if article would explain how a pseudonymous crypto can be used for money laundering then we could debate. 
Bitcoin is not a good tool for money laundering, you have to enter and exit the bitcoin ecosystem which makes you twice vulnerable, not to mention that all transactions within it are recorded on a public ledger.

@_date: 2015-10-05 23:18:30
It just seems logical to me that notaries/moderators aren't paid if they don't work. In a case of a non disputed escrow order they have nothing to do so they are essentially paid to do nothing.
I don't see any problem with moderators wanting more disputes to occurs since they have no power over whether an order will be disputed or not.
@_date: 2016-05-25 23:26:55
when/If bitcoin becomes mainstream there will be hundreds of transactions per sec on the main chain. LN transactions have to be settled at some point and that creates on chain transactions. The price per bitcoin will also likely be a lot higher so even if number of coins rewarded are decreased it would still be profitable for miner.
If bitcoin takes like 20 more years to become mainstream then it will have likely failed. In the worst case scenario, i am sure companies would be willing to share some of their profit to miners until the thing becomes widely used. It is very unlikely bitcoin will still be around in a decade or two if it hasn't achieved mass adoption.

Some people believe that cryptos are being used to promote a cashless society and weaken nation states which makes sense until you realize that this thing is not going away, illegal or not. So unless there is a vulnerability/backdoor in the code that only creator knows about(unlikely at this point) i don't see it as a trojan horse.
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:21:33

It is not linked to a bank account, it's linked to a bitcoin wallet. Basically you have 2 wallets on the company's website, a bitcoin wallet and a fiat wallet. When you want to top up your credit card to spend money or withdraw cash you just convert the btc into fiat. 
I think some companies dont even require you to do the conversion, they will deduct the amount straight from your btc balance.

They don't know where all the mining is happening, there is like thousands of miners behind tor and there is hundreds of differents crypto that uses proof of stake which doesn't require any physical mining so yeah they could kill the price of bitcoin but they won't be able to stop people from using satoshi's protocol to exchange money.

As far as i am aware you can buy bitcoin with a credit card on circle.com, coinbase.com and changetip.com. All of these sites will ask you to verify your ID before you can buy though.
There is also a company called libertyx.com in the US where you can buy bitcoins easily with cash at many different locations.

Ok didn't now about that but i still think something is a miss with the whole story. Why would Gavin fly all the way to London when Wright could just send Gavin a transaction with one of satoshi's wallet and be done in 2 min, doesn't make any sense.

Honesty is a good thing you know. 
Also corporations and VCs are in it only for profit, that's it. Their definition of success is mass adoption.

When trading with a reputable user one shouldn't have to dispute the transaction anyway. Do OB's notaries take a  fee on non-disputed escrow orders? That would be silly. 
The reputation system will solve the last issue you mentionned, a good notaries knows how to resolve a dispute fairly.

Multibit is a lightweight client which means you do not have to download the whole blockchain so should be very quick to synch. Uninstall it and download again should work. Don't forget to back up wallet file before you do that.
@_date: 2016-07-02 22:39:40
Because you said your transactions were confirmed and then went unconfirmed. This doesn't happen, it's the whole point of the blockchain once it's confirmed it is forever and no one can unconfirm it.
Just check your transactions on blockchain.info you will see that they are confirmed, the only reason i see why your transactions are unconfirmed is because the blockchain has been reset to a state prior to when they happened so your soft need to download latest blocks.
