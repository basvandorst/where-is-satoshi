Diversification is the key.  Good job spreading it around to multiple loans.  This way if one of the loans defaults you won't lose your entire investment.   :)

Dear munister,  Those emails are not from BTCJam.  We believe you are being phished.  Please contact us at support and try logging into your account.  We have not locked your account.  Thanks,  Thomas

We'll freeze the account.  We're looking into this more.  Thanks -- Thomas

That is the correct account from where we send our emails.  
Since the phisher took over the user's email account, it was likely he was reading the message in the Sent Mail and responding.

We only send out emails from support -- outgoing email address can easily be faked. (so it would be easy to make it look like you received a message from any address.) 
On the account/username issue, it seems you have multiple accounts and it may be logging you into the wrong account.  We suggest you log in with your  email address instead of facebook or another login.

Also in case you're wondering, I am Tom from BTCJam.  Here's a verification tweet: 
(always a good idea to verify... phishing happens to even the best of us.)

Thanks for the suggestion.  I've forwarded it to our technical staff.  We'll definitely check it out.  :)
