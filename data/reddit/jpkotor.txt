He's (whooosh) right. There are plenty of other countries with similar gun ownership rates that fall closer to the level of crime you're describing than to ours. Our problem is that we have a lot of crime AND there happens to be a lot of guns, but the guns are not the problem themselves.
Take, for example, our homicide rate. If you took out all of our gun homicides and pretend they never happen, we still have a homicide rate comparable to the UK, even slightly higher. That's assuming ALL those people who killed someone with guns wouldn't at least try to kill someone another way---I would argue they would. Maybe they wouldn't be AS successful, but that would still send our homicide rate and violent crime rate (since unsuccessful homicides would be successful violent assaults) much much higher than most European nations. 
It's hard for Europeans to understand our gun and crime issues because the dynamics are so different. The super liberal Americans who are against gun ownership consistently show little understanding about the issue or guns themselves (even Obama AND Biden often cite false statistics and impractical alternatives). The fact of the matter is that as long as our crime is this high, people need the right to defend themselves when police response times often exceed 30 minutes. We need guns for that, and then guns fall in the wrong hands they get used in crime. It's a cycle that we can only address by addressing crime, not guns. 
Hope your smug European self learned something from this. Thanks for reading.
