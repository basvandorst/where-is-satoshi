I'd say paper wallet is the more secure of all the storage ways, if done correctly. I'm not talking about some site that does it for you but doing it yourself on airgapped computer or tails. Am I mistaken in this assumption?

I hope they solve it. But so far no one has. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:13:42
The thing is, it's SO obvious that everyone just got tired of arguing it for 2+years. 
Your calculation also doesn't account for business to business transactions, settlements for stock/bond purchases etc. Or the thing that's gonna explode the most, computer to computer transactions. 
It's so blatantly obvious for anyone who spent any time thinking about it that we can't scale by bigger blocks. There has to be a combination. 
But some people  want their magic internet money to rise in price TODAY so they can sell it for more FIAT money. 
I'm just happy most of the community are still in it for the long run.

That's assuming someone only has 1 channel open to this hub. If they have another channel and are going somewhere else there are other routes, it won't have to go through SLEEPYARK. And the big problem IF this is the case is they have to open a new channel. It's not optimal, but it's far from a big problem imo

Sounds like you didn't have solid stocks at all, and you had one at a time.. yes you did something really, really wrong
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:48:53
You also do it for your own security. Having your own node validate your transactions instead of a third party server that you in theory don't know anything about.

It's every individuals responsibility to educate themself. If you get fooled by something that's so easy to fact check or figure out yourself then bitcoin / lightning _at the moment_ is probably not for you anyways. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:31:58
It's my opinion based on research in the field. 
The gambling site can just as well use a sidechain with atomic swaps, 100% same functionality, none of the drawback. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:37:16
I'm amazed at the quality responses that every lightning question seems to get. Also each attempt to throw a lie (or missunderstanding) out there instantly gets 2-3 real quality responses informing the OP of his mistake. This bcash debacle did very well in forcing people to look into and understand the underlaying tech to bitcoin. What doesn't kill it makes it stronger.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:45:08
This is true. But it's also difficult to know what to do once the money actually becomes life changing. How much of a life change do you want? 
70BTC atm invested well can probably last you a lifetime without working. But if you wanna travel, you'd need more. (Numbers might be off for your situation, but the point still stands)
I believe everyone who has alot of stake in btc should atleast concider that there will never be a point in time where it's obvious what to do. Therefore, get a plan on what to do so you don't have to be emotional about it when the time comes. 
I believe even a bad plan is better then no plan. Happy hodling.

My first buy was at one time, got it separated in 3 orders. $26, $30, $28 then total flat crash that lasted for years with a low at 2$.
"You merely adopted the dip. I was born in it, molded by it." 
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:18:18
Yes, pretty much sums it up. I think it's great that anyone can choose (or not choose) to go for the coin they think is the better. If bcash gets more adoption and stresstests actual 8mb blocks that's a good thing for bitcoin. 
I personally just feel like I've waited 7 years already, and with everything being so damn close now I can wait another year. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:41:47
The greatest strength and the greatest weakness of bitcoin is its decentralization. It does come with big drawbacks when it comes to things such as marketing or flexibility. But I also do believe that the ONLY reason to use cryptocurrency is if it is infact decentralized. Else a database-system will always beat it in speed, scalability, cost, ease of upgrade etc. 
However things such as marketing might make a difference in the short term, but in the end a shitty car is a shitty car and the truth behind the branding will catch up to it. 
I think it's great that you've done your own research and came to your own conclusion, as long as people take responsibility for their own decisions and do what they believe is best I think this will all work out just fine.

Can you not just have your phone check for your specific transaction being broadcasted once in a while? It should not require much network and your phone is usually always connected somehow. 
Similarly, can you not ask your home node (or a third party) for the current closest routing to where you want to send from your phone? What is the risk in this? You should be able to verify that the reciever is correct, so you risk some higher LN fees?

Mostly yes, but miners incentives are not always inline with users like you stated. Miners want return on investment quickly, since their hardware both loses in value over time and doesn't have that long of a life anyways. 
Either way, I realized as I wrote that comment I shouldn't have :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:16:01
Well if you connect to your bakery directly (0hop), you'll be able to transact to the coffeshop  through bakery - mom (or someone else) - coffeshop (2 hop). And the risk of a bakery disconnecting its node that it uses to get paid is alot less then your mom disconnecting, or closing her channel for some reason.
TL:DR either will work
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:53:23
The newest transaction always (In the implementations I've seen) have a shorter duration then the previous transaction. Therefore the auto close will always happen with the most up to date transaction first.

I agree,  I've gotten comfortable enough with it. I probably shouldn't recommend it to anyone though.

So then I'll spin up 50k nodes on google servers and make a ton of money, and so will everyone else
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:45:03
There is a discussion of how true this actually is / will be depending on the topology. A onion network such as TOR can choose any other node to go to, whereas LN can only choose one that it is connected to. However, it's definately not worse, and if it turns out to not be better, then there are many other interesting proposals comming for privacy, it's not LNs main attraction anyways.
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:21:52
Also bandwidth does not follow moore's law, and is leaning more towards pay/mb. This would be the real bitcoin node killer.

Read about satoshidice
 
That was 1 application that used the blockchain, it filled the blocks by itself, and that's ok since there was room and miners included transactions for free. But with 1gb blocks, we again would see use cases like this that fills up all the cheap space on the chain. 
Empty blocks = 0 or 1 satoshi/byte transactions. There is unlimited need for this.

I'm just gonna conect to where I need to send money most, probably an exchange and a store that accepts bitcoin that I use alot. Other people will also be connected to them, so I'll route through them to whatever else is on LN for the occasion that I need to. No one knows, but this is my prediction. Since a store always wants to have their node online, this wont be a problem. Bigger stores with more customers will have more connections, but it's not important to connect to them directly. No one knows how it will play out
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:33:43
You were right until the last sentence. However any blockchain that isn't full will be free to use, or very cheap (1sat/byte). It's a problem letting miners decide what transactions are worth including since they calculate profit / hour. The network doesn't care about profit / hour they care about other metrics. So the miners incentive isn't aligned with the networks and this will cause problems down the line.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:09:46

I bought a new phone yesterday and I was adviced to pay 450 or 500 satoshi/byte. I overpaid at 337 and it confirmed in the next block. I didnt know if there was a timeout window on the payment so I felt it was worth it.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:57:43
That's awesome. We dont have to agree but being informed about the problems and solutions available is a nice first step. :) 
For the record I'm not negative about bcash as a protocoll. I welcome trying out different ways of solving scaling issue, but I prefer playing safe with the valuable innovation that is bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:51:04
he's saying he wants to refund a lightningchannel with bitcoin directly from an exchange, instead of buying bitcoin, transfering to his wallet, and then sending it to a LN channel
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:52:35
I saw this experiment once. A bunch of participants had to solve different logical problems wich had only 1 correct solution but ofcourse many solutions could seem like the correct one. 
After they were done, they went to the next room and got to watch the others trying to solve the problem and they had to critique them. 
The fun thing was everyone could spot the person who had the wrong solution. But the smartest guy there, with the most correct answers was one of the persons who got the most heat from the others. Since they couldn't understand his brilliance they assumed he was incorrect. 
Lesson being:
It's easy to spot someone who's wrong, but it's almost equaly difficult to spot someone who's correct if the problem they solve is complex enough.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:37:05
Who decides who's honest or not then? The protocoll cant work like this. In a game with no judge, all rules have to be motivated by incentive.

"A fool and his money are soon parted" :) 
It's a good fight to inform people, but it's also each individuals own responsibility to do what he finds is best. If someone wishes to believe that LN will never work and he wants to buy another coin, who are you and me to tell him otherwise. You are probably correct, I'm just sick of hearing the same circular argument each day.

Tell me more about how Marxism is a good economic model? Russia went from the  wheat importer (and starving) to the  wheat exporter in some 10 years after the soviet fall. 
Look at the difference in east and west germany, south and north korea, quality of life in china before and after the big leap. One of the richest countries in the world venezuela that currently can't feed its people. How much emperical evidence do you need?
I mean marxism apply labor theory of value. Anyone believing in this are BLINDED by ideology or haven't spent 5 minutes thinking about it. Dig a hole and fill it up, it takes 5 people 5 hours. What is the filled up hole worth? OK I just disproved the central thesis to Marxism.

@_date: 2018-01-05 11:44:29
Miners could decide togeather to increase the miningreward to 50btc / block, and you would accept this without knowing about it since not your or anyone elses full node checks the rules.
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:07:04
Lets say 10% risk of not getting in to the next 2-3 blocks, its 10% chance of a supportticket  wich is an indirect cost and a unhappy customer. Adding on some sat/byte to avoid this is not so strange, especially since the system is somehow automated. The problem is not people who pay high fees cause they want to or feel it's worth it, this will always be how the market works.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:28:28
I understand his comment like arbitra ge between markets, like buy on bitstamp sell on kraken to even out the prices, not actual fees through LN. Either way he should read up about LN since traders (in either scenario) wouldn't occupy the mempool

You are in here complaining that lightning, that's been in development for 6 months (required malleability fix wich we got in august) still isn't a "one click solution". It's being developed, for you, for free, by people who will not earn any money by spending their time doing it.

Ok, I took the bait..
"The platform is being constructed in layers, which gives the system the flexibility to be more easily maintained and allow for upgrades by way of soft forks. After the settlement layer that will run Ada is complete, a separate computing layer will be built to handle smart contracts, the digital legal agreements that will underpin future commerce and business. "
Hate to break it to you, but this is exactly what Bitcoin already is doing. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:53:34
I think its fine to have fractional reserve etc, I believe the world today would not work without it. But back it by something that can not be printed infinite. May it be a precious metal or a crypto. This way there is a option to opt out of the crazyness if you want to. Usually if there's just an option (competition) then either option that exists behaves better.
Example: People realize other people have too big loans, they feel like the market is getting unstable. They purchase bitcoin. This forces the price of bitcoin up, so the cost of lending money backed by bitcoin goes up, so the interest rates needs to go up. 
It gets more expensive to loan money, so people get more incentive to pay of debt and debt overall decreases.
I probably didn't think about this enough, happy to hear some thoughts.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:21:48
Sidechains are bitcoin. If you haven't even understood sidechains or drivechains then you should spend more time reading and less time voicing your oppinion, since you clearly aren't up to date on any of the solutions available.

The channels would still close automatically when the time period for the channel expires, or if the other party closes the channel. The only concern would be a malicious other party that is aware that you lost your device and closes the channel with a faulty state in his favor.

with LN you have to be connected always, it has nothing to do with "hubs", only with your counterparty in a channel. If you chose to connect directly to a well connected node, then you monitor this channel. However I have no idea why anyone would have incentive to do this.. if you wanna pay for your coffe you're gonna send them a normal btc transaction and open your channel with them in your first purchase. The coffe shop will then route you around the network and you can most likely pay anyone. You dont have to trust the shop, you only need to monitor the network, but its a local shop that lives of your business and its reputation, and in the odd case that it will try to cheat you, you will get all your money back and visit another shop the next time (Or not since you obviously drink for free here).
Bitcoins decentralization is important so it keeps its core principles of anyone can use it and its trustless. No matter how big of a node there is in LN, this node has absolutely no power to do anything other then be annoying, at wich point it will no longer be a well connected node since people will connect somewhere else. This is a fringe scenario, that even in its worse case is a tad annoying. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:40:36
It's only 1 transaction to create a channel, and there is 1 to close it.
If your counterparty closes the channel, then it closes, you don't have to do anything you will recieve your left over BTC.
If your counterparty closes with a faulty state, you are allowed a set amount of time (that you chose when creating the channel) to broadcast your newer transaction. You will then recieve all of your original funds, AND all of your counter parties funds, as a way of punishing this behaviour. 
So the only real time this will be a problem, is if you are not online for several days AND your counterparty knows this. If he's does not know this then he will never broadcast a faulty state because of the high risk of losing all his channel balance.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:55:46
People won't trust none-open source with their real btc. Atleast I won't. To answer your question you can always outsorce the routing to a third party, or your home node if you run one and just have that calculate the shortest route. This shouldn't be a difficult thing to set up I believe.
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:14:41
How is it "dark" atm?
There's probably as many highly impactful bitcoin improvements in beta this year as there has been 2014-2017 because of the maleability fix making them finally possible. 
The price went up well over 10x since this time last year. If this is "dark" then I'm looking forward to the light!
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:36:58
Yea I agree. But as long as there's the "threat" of you always monitoring the channel, I'd never risk all my channel funds trying to fool you. 
Also for most people the channel will be a one way channel only used for purchases. This way there are no funds to steal since the last balance is always the one where the counterparty has the most of the bitcoins. Broadcasting a incorrect state in this example will not result in theft of any funds, rather the other way around. A service provider or store would need to be online all the time, atleast often enough, but I envision this as being a none issue for a store to be online :)
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:26:27
It's working very well imo. Coinbase outsorce their fees onto the end user, so they haven't felt the cost of them being suboptimal in making onchain transactions. Bitstamp pay the fees themself and because of this they had good incentives to decrease their costs of onchain transactions. 
Since users are aware of what they had to pay to transfer out of coinbase, they look for alternatives and voice their oppinion to coinbase. Coinbase either lose alot of customers or fixes the problem. 
Imagine if we raised the blocksize just cause it was full. Coinbase or anyone else wouldn't have to treat the blockspace as the scarce immensely valuable thing that it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:50:14
But layered technology on top of a blockchain is precisely what LN is, and there is also improvements to run smart contracts on top of bitcoin with sidechain/drivechain technology. This is what bitcoin is doing, and it is what Cardano is also doing. 
Cardano also uses blockchain technology as a settlement layer, exactly like bitcoin is. You are correct they are brilliant ideas, and bitcoin is ahead in implementing them.
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:35:37
LN requires a malleability fix, lightning in its current form requires Segwit. If you run current LN software on a chain that is not segwit  compatible it will not work. This is easy info to check yourself, but it's also very obvious to understand if you think about the fact that segwit changes how input and outputs work. Take some time and inform yourself, it seems someone has been missleading you.
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:13:47
Ether is showing why smart contracts should not be handled directly by a blockchain, but by a layer ontop. Ether was a great idea, it was never a currency and they have first mover advantage in the smart contracts space. But once all this can be done with the backing of bitcoin security and more robust by layered technology, I dont see alot of use for ether anymore. Either way speculating in the value of ethers was always a weird thing.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:24:55
I appologize. 
But having the backseat full of kids asking "are we there yet" can get on your nerves even though there are no hard feelings. Your expectations are not aligned with reality. Nothing this major gets done in 6 months. If it has a GUI and works for anyone to set up and use with ease in 1 year, I'll be very impressed. 
(I dont work on any LN protocoll)
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:31:33
Also: I'm not all that affected if not many others runs lightning. I'll just happily use it with the other people, stores and exchanges that adopt it and enjoy pretty much all the same benefits.
But, I truly believe lightning is the killerapp of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:24:26
They are tied up in a LN-channel this is true. But I'd argue they are much more "free". Since they can be spent instantly at no cost to anyone running LN (That you can route to, wich will be everyone)

"easier way to handle this already" What? Segwit wich is needed to start developing this is 6 months old.. how impatient are you? It's bloody amazing they have gotten this far already.
"These coders need to be paired up with GUI savvy app developers" You are free to contribute yourself. If you are just waiting for other people to do work for you then you need to sit down and wait for your turn. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:19:33
more nodes in the same place does nothing for security.
And I dont know why they would? They get alot of new customers paying for their servers and these nodes will not require alot. If anything they will do it themself to earn money (or someone else will)
Point is, the reason nodes aren't getting paid is cause it's not possible to do so. If you have an idea that would actually work (your current one does not), it would be an amazing addition to the protocol, and if you figure it out you should submit a bip.
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:47:05
They need maleability fix to use LN and in its current form they need segwit to implement it. At this point, I wouldn't even be very supriced if they implemented segwit but called it something else :)

Made this response in another thread.. who knows.. 
"I have also thought about this. It is an interesting thought avenue to go down. I predict there will still be fractional reserve for loans, only (as it always was except last 60 years) backed by something (Previously gold) that can't be printed in any amount. This way when I believe people have to high loans in general, I get scared about the market and I seek something more stable. So I buy bitcoin directly. This increases the cost for banks to make loans backed by bitcoin since it pushes the price up and this in turn decreases peoples incentive to loan money since their rates go up, and creates a market based economy for loans."

Timeline is obviously just speculation, but I do believe you are correct in your comparison. Only nerds could use internet before netscape. With netscape regular people could start using it but there wasn't a whole lot to do, this grew organically and saw more and more adoption.

Thanks for the links, they are taken out of context though. 
The comment greg replies to states that segwit changes the economic incentives of bitcoin. The commenter mixed up LN with segwit. In this context they have nothing to do with eachother since segwit does not change the economic incentives (transactions on chain pays miners). 
This was also one year ago, so we did not have segwit yet, and the proposals of LN could be developed with any available malleabilityfix. Now however we have this specific malleability fix, and the LN software of today is adapted to this. It's true it's possible with any malleability fix, but current implementations of LN only works with segwit.
I dont know what your point is with the second comment, it basically says that a malleabilityfix is required, wich we bot know is true.

But imagine how free the base layer will be if everyone makes 2 transactions on it instead of 80. It's equivalent of 40mb blocks in your example (~70 with segwit). 
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:22:01
Honestly, they(some) just lie about things that are complex until most people have seen it in action (Someone can steal your funds if you keep them in a segwit adress). Once it's been disproven without a doubt, wich takes alot of effort obviously, they just claim the next thing.
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:20:43
I saw it in some simplified video and I dont remember wich one it was, or checked if it was accurate. 
But in the whitepaper of the LN (  ) it states in the abstract that "(...)  uncooperative or hostile participants,
through a series of _decrementing timelocks._"
So from my understanding each new transaction has a new timelock that is set to expire prior to the last one. So if either party does nothing then the most up to date (latest) transaction expires first and settles on the chain. I should probably not have commented before I actually read more about it, I might be incorrect.. but I dont have time atm so I'm hoping for a good response by someone who knows more :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:24:06
So you have a channel open, through some hops you route your way to bitstamp. Bitstamp has (hopefully in the future) the function to purchase coins already inside lightning, with these newly purchased coins you can top up your LN channel balance again, without making a onchain transaction.
(Or you sell/perform some work so someone pays you with coins inside LN)
A posibility is to always use LN for everything bitcoin, and only settle a channel if someone tries to cheat. Think of the base layer as taking someone to court. Most contract/agreements are settled without problem between peers, but if someone tries to do something "illegal" you take them to court. This would likely not happen alot.

The exchanges will prefer to be centralized ofcourse. But whoever first implements a working, easy to use, decentralized exchange using LN (or something else) will steal their business eventually.

I read some more of your comments and came to realize that you actually only claimed the current state, its true that this is the current state of the network.
But just posting data is one thing, we also need to analyze this data and draw conclusions from it. Currently the most well connected node is a store that sells stickers, its one of the first implementations where you can actually use it so many people only want a sticker and not be part of the network for now, to include this edge case and calculate future scenarios based on it is ofcourse not wrong, but the question is, what good will it do?
Added: Thanks for this info and calculations though, its a good thing dont get me wrong from the way I responded.

I have also thought about this. It is an interesting thought avenue to go down. I predict there will still be fractional reserve for loans, only (as it always was except last 60 years) backed by something (Previously gold) that can't be printed in any amount. 
This way when I believe people have to high loans in general, I get scared about the market and I seek something more stable. So I buy bitcoin directly. This increases the cost for banks to make loans backed by bitcoin since it pushes the price up and this in turn decreases peoples incentive to loan money since their rates go up, and creates a market based economy for loans.
I'll also adress this inflatiatory problem that you paint with that people will always want to spend their money on things they want or need. No one will stop eating etc. People will just spend what they feel is worth spending and save the rest. To me this sounds healthy. And it won't mean that people will never buy anythign besides the most basic. The best example is probably electronics. If you just don't buy a new computer but (HODL) instead you can get that same computer in a few years for half the price. Or new cellphone etc. But no one buys an iphone 3 today, I don't think this will change alot. I actually believe consumer mentality will become more healthy if this is how it works. 
You are correct that it will shrink the economy though, but it will also decrease the risk in the economy. What's better? I can't honestly say.

I think what he means is that bitcoins in themself do not produce value, there's no inherent mechanism in bitcoin that makes holders of bitcoins wealthy, just at the moment more and more people want in, since more and more people realize FIAT will not be great long term. But I'm also fairly certain no one holds large amounts of FIAT in their account hoping for it to grow.
However if you own a stock in a company you get a part of that companys profits, that way if you have enough, you will be making more money then you spend. If you spend a satoshi, you will never get it back, unless you work for it and buy it back.
Ideally though I'd buy stocks with bitcoins and get paid in revenue in bitcoins :)

If they short it with 10x for 1000$ leverage and then use 5000$ of bought up bitcoins to sell for a low price to press the price down, they make some money selling the 5000$ worth and then 10x the money on however low they can push the price. 
Change 1000$ and 5000$ to many millions of dollars, whatever it could take.
Long term the price won't care, since underlaying value won't care. :)

Hes saying that if blocks are not full, it will be free to be included in a block, usecases will explode and we will again have full blocks. Check satoshidice for example, it would be nice if everyone could always be included for free but its not reasonable. Limited blockspace forces development. Do you think we would have .jpg or .mp4 or .Zip compression if the internet was instantly unlimited speed? Now unlimited internet speed does not have obvious drawbacks, but unlimited size of a block obviously does. Resource scarcity fuels technology development and adoption.

@_date: 2017-12-07 09:39:18
This is still true, you just take an amount of your proven holdings (through blockchain) and lock them between you and another party. These can be spent inside LN but they are locked for onchain transactions for the duration. Once you close your channel the new balances are written to the blockchain and you again can spend them as you like.
So first you prove to your counterparty that you have the funds through the blockchain, later you prove your new balance on the blockchain. But no one will know what happened inside the LN, but it doesn't matter for the purpose of proving how much funds you have.

I've read alot of your arguments in this thread. I think it boils down to you are afraid that people will chose another coin and business will stop supporting bitcoin. 
Now why are you afraid of this? Does it matter how many people use it today? Bitcoin is not ready for the whole world to use today, however maybe in the future it will be ready to change the world.
It is pretty clear however that you view bitcoin as an investment vehicle, where more users would drive up the price short term, and this is true it probably would if you could fool some more people that bitcoin "solved the scaling issue". 
However I'm very happy that the developers don't see it this way. What matters is not the state of bitcoin today or tomorrow, it's the state of bitcoin forever.

No, this is a misunderstanding.. I can use it between someone else without anything.. 90% of my transactions atm is between my wallet and an exchange. I can set this up myself instantly as soon as my exchange supports it, and it would 
1)be alot more safe for me since I dont have to batch transfers but I can send the exact amount to the exchange the same minute I wanna sell, or transfer of the exchange the same minute that I've bought. So I remove almost all counterparty risk.
2) Could probably do 1 transaction per year on chain instead of 1 transaction every few days as it's been lately wich will save alot of blockspace.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:19:27
Since you can cut out the middleman, who obviously charges a fee, that could prove valueable. To not have to ask this third party for permission, that could prove valueable. To be able for anyone to verify their own wealth, could prove valueable. To be able to bring your wealth across borders and no one can steal it from you, might prove valueable (See syrian refugees).
It's great that you look at it with sceptical eyes, and what will 1 btc be worth tomorrow? No one can say. To buy bitcoin as a speculation is not what bitcoin is for, its not a value producing asset. But it's clearly not worth nothing. And a part of something that is worth something, will have value.

It's true, however lets say a commodity or a company got listed at 0$ and some people see a potential value in this it would likely behave in a similar way with very rapid growth. This however never happens, but it happened with bitcoin. 
Add to the fact that not everyone instantly knows about the listed commodity or company, and that it's very difficult to obtain but has gotten alot easier and safer lately.
All this being said, short term the price increase is probably too high. Long term? Who knows.

You do know that if segwit2x had been considered the viable option and we all went for it, the network would have shut down and we would be left with a network that had failed and all the trust issues that brings. 
If you actually don't know there was 
 a "off by one" error in the code that made the segwit2x fork not launch. This comes from it being rushed, not having competent developers etc. All the above reasons are why I didn't support it and even if the fork would have launched I would have been correct in not supporting it. We need to be better than this and not rush things.
Miners are not technically competent to make code decisions. They chose what chain to mine and what transactions to include nothing else.

I agree with you, there is a blocksize increase required and it has to be prepared well in time. However if we're gonna hardfork, I'd much rather bundle it togeather with other improvements that also require a hardfork. Hardforks are dangerous, alot more so on a very distributed network such as bitcoin. And for, in my opinion, no real gain if we just double blocksize.
And as far as I know, no other coin is either very decentralized in nodes OR shows that storage/cpu resource is manageable, since no other coin has the volume to consistently fill even 2mb blocks. 
Now it's not a matter of too big or too small, it's a sliding scale. Double the size and some people will be priced out, some people are already priced out at 1mb and many people would be fine with 8mb blocks. But I believe that the more people are able to manage to run a full node, the better. Bitcoin is an increadibly ineffective way of doing things, the only upside is distributed network, so we have to take care of it.
My original point still stands, and it is that resource scarsity fuels inovation and forces people and companies to adopt new technology that improves the way the network functions, at no cost for the network. High fees is what started the campaign to ask coinbase to start using segwit, if fees werent a "problem" then coinbase probably never would use segwit, and instead keep wasting precious blockspace forever, now it's on their roadmap expected to be activated in a few months.

Likely not since there are already timelocks and presigned transactions are also already a thing. The transaction is valid, but funds are locked until a date. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:47:46
Thing is, if one wallet "knows" this fee, and sets it, it basically means every other wallet will also be able to know this through the same algoritm. This will make the block full at this fee, so someone will not be included, and instead they will see that if they spend just 1 satoshi more they will get in. Then everyone will see this and everyone does the same :)
Also, most transactions aren't time sensitive, I mostly don't mind waiting even a few days, I just plan accordingly :)

Once it's more tested to be working as intended it can be trusted, it's also trustless in the sense you dont have to trust a 3rd party with anything. 
LN will in theory increase throughput infinitely (You never have to leave it if you dont want to), but it wont be in reality. 
I think the first question you made is the most important part about scaling in this way, there is no downside to adding LN layer, if it doesn't work as intended no one will use it, and we haven't compromised the base layer in any way and can go about scaling in other ways. Also if you don't feel like using it, you dont have to

The problem is really that there was no risk to the bank giving out these loans, cause government bailed them out.

If you once believed it was a good thing to buy at value X and nothing fundamentally changed it would be quite silly to realize losses this early.

We evaluate the technical and other aspects of each coin and rely on the fact that the best suited coin will also be the most successful coin. We keep doing this evaluation all the time and if something else comes along wich is better, then this is will likely be the most successful coin in the future. That just isn't the case at this point in time and I believe it never will be. The fact that bitcoin was able to have organic growth before someone shone the spotlight on it is what gives it its power and true decentralization. This is something that I believe will not ever be replicated. But new events will ofcourse be looked at, I just deem them unlikely and they definately haven't occured yet.
Also remember that bitcoin or crypto is not here to make anyone rich. That (might) just be a sideeffect of being alive during the financial revolution.

Segwit can be 100% if people want, it's opt-in. You don't understand the point you are arguing. Segwit is not needed for each transaction to be a valuable improvement. If you want to mess with lightning, you put your coins in a segwit adress.
Segwit transactions being higher or lower on the network has absolutely nothing to do with the viability of LN. Anyone interested in LN can use it and that's the point.

Lets say you have 100k$ in bitcoin at 20k and you decide to sell it that's 5btc and 100k$ volume, if you sell all your coins when the price is lower say 5k then that is 5x5k=25k volume.

Node count has not risen in the same rate as users, mainly (guessing) because before there was enthusiasts only and they all wanted to run a full node, there was limited or no options, and the synctime was alot smaller. Incentivising running a full node is a big challenge for bitcoin.

I agree. I however don't see that him offering to sell me a coin with no use would prove that it posseses intrinsic value or not. The intrinsic value (as far as im concerned) is attached to bitcoin in terms of the idea, the people working on it, the different usecases that are beyond currency like trustlessness in various forms. A alt doesn't have these, especially not something he just spun up. 
These are defined as "intangible factors" wich combined with tangible assets, such as he talks about create intrinsic value. 
To me it's more of a theoretical discussion and I don't know the answer.

You can send fractions of satoshis, currently 1/1000 of satoshi is the base unit in LN. 
You can however only get full satoshis on baselayer so depending on what implementation you're running it will get rounded in different ways, and sometimes it will be added to miner fee

No you can do sub satoshi, it's just an accounting inside 1 channel so it can go as low as it wants to. When you close the channel what happends depends on what you agreed on when opening, different implementations currently have different rules. It either rounds it to full satoshi (0,51 = 1) or it rolls for it (0,51 = 51% chance of 1, 49% chance of 0) This last might not be implemented yet but I know its a proposal.

You didn't think this through. People dont accept IOUs the bank accepts the IOU from you, in return they get interest for the risk they take. People accept dollars, the bank asks the centralbank if it can create some new dollars for lending. 
A newly created dollar is the exact same as a older dollar. 
If you were to send me another coin and say "this is worth exactly as much as a bitcoin" I would never accept that at full price, since there is some form of risk involved and a bitcoin is 0 risk.

It isn't tokenized though. The way you describe is a possible way to do offchain things. It's called "atomic swap" or "drivechains" but this is not how LN works. LN works with unbroadcasted 2-of-2 (BITCOIN)transactions.
 These work the same as any normal bitcoin transaction only that you need 2 keys to use it. They have been part of bitcoin since forever.
We keep track of our individual funds between you and me in the contract (latest signed bitcointransaction) that we have between eachother. The only thing sent between us is this latest contract and it defines who owns what. I know eclair shows a little symbol infront of you LN balance but this is just a representation of how many of your bitcoins are available at your side of the "shared account" it's not a token. Sorry.
I've tried my best to explain to you and I'm gonna have to asume that you are trolling at this point. If not please link me to any official lightning page that talks about tokens/chips/seashells or whatever. There wont be one, but I don't think thats even gonna convince you.

Peter Todd even has a script on github that double spends for you (without rbf). He demonstrated using it to trick coinbase (but emailed them and told them about it), the bitcoin community is very honest and invested in the tech so people aren't trying to cheat eachother. But if we think down the line for mainstream, it's obvious 0-conf is not the solution for anything.

@_date: 2018-05-01 19:30:25
So you call the contract a token? That's the only thing sent between us.
Tokens in crypto means something different that's why people don't understand you. 
A token is something that represents value you are correct. But a token has a set value. 1btc=1btc or 1USDT=1$. It can also be sold to anyone, this contract that entitles you to btc is only valuable to you, since the contract spends to your adress, no one elses.
If you infact mean a token situation on LN I would send you x amount of tokens that are worth the same as y amount of bitcoin(maybe x=y) for some goods that you later can exchange for real bitcoins. If I purchase from you a second time I send you more tokens. This is how you believe it works but it's not. If it was then it would be in the code, but it's not. Something else could work like this, LN does not. You also didn't post any official LN-info about token, I wonder why. 
Last time I explain how it actually work.
Opening transaction. A 2-of-2 transaction that requires your and my signature to spend. I add 1 btc you add 1btc.
We type out a contract and we both get a copy. You sign my copy, I sign yours. If either of us wants to we can show this to the network and it would spend in the way the contract states. Right now I get 1btc and you get 1btc. The software keeps track of this amount so you know how much you have left.
I buy something from you for 0.2btc. We both agree, so we draw up a new contract, you sign my copy I sign yours. Now we both can show this new contract to recieve the funds in the 2-of-2 adress if we want to.
Note that you don't own anything more right now than you did before, no bitcoins no tokens that represents something, nothing. You do however own the proof that you can show to recieve 1.2btc whenever you want. You have a contract.
If we transact again, we do the same thing again but this time the contract states you have 1.4btc and I have 0.6 but nothing has actually happened other than us drafting a new contract and signing it. 
I wanna close the channel and you agree so we both broadcast the latest tranasction, all signed etc. When this is included in a block by miners you own 1.4btc and I own 0.6. 
This is what keeps track of the balances, words written. No token that represents value, a contract.
You have infact broken down your arguments very well, it's just not how it works. Something COULD work like that, LN does not.
"Just agree this separate value can be sold for a different price than the underlying BTC asset within in the channel." It's not possible, why would anyone else pay for a transaction that gives you bitcoin?
Just post all the official info on LN-tokens if you wanna keep discussing. I hope atleast you tried to find it?

@_date: 2018-05-04 16:49:25
I chose not to respond because the response would be too complicated to get a clear point out, and frankly you made very clear that you werent interesting in discussing anyways. 
I responded to your offering of a token, and tried to make it clear that I only would buy it if it offered something no other coin did. I never claimed bitcoin had intrinsic value, but I was interested in walking down a path exploring if certain properties of bitcoin or blockchain could be considered intrinsic. Atleast in the sense of an intangible asset. Alot of these things would be things that your new chain wouldn't posses. Such as open immutable ledger, developers community security, infrastructure, trust etc. 
I wanted to ask your or anyone elses opinion on these if any would qualify.
"Something of value to someone" is basically how gold is valuable to someone who wants a pretty necklace or someone in the chip manufacturing industry,the second or third usecase that it still possesses that makes it a commodity. But you chose to not want to understand that either. 
Either way people who believe in intrinsic value as something important for instance when investing in gold are not really in the ballpark anyways
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:18:30
I don't wanna paraphrase, someone else might remember better. The issue was the trust that you had to put in something, this makes the use of blockchain a expensive solution that isn't better.

You can tell people about your node just not the full network. For instance someone could be connected to one of the "end nodes" here and have access to the whole network while being invisible. His friend could also route through him etc if he knows about it.

Why would running my own lightning node be practically infeasible? I don't see it like that at all. To me it seems extremely easy. It's in the very least orders of magnitude easier then your example with using cash only.
Also by doing this you can "buy stuff online", ofcourse putting trust in the fact that a store will deliver something you bought. This will only be small amounts of money at a time and it will be well known at once if they try to cheat anyone, so I don't think a comparison with that and someone keeping all of your bitcoin is relatable.
Trust is earned. Right now I trust only one bitcoin service and that's an exchange , and I still limit my exposure as much as I can. I do buy alot of things using bitcoin, I trust the fact that it would be well known if they are cheating people. But in the future, companies and services will have time to prove themselfs and build a track record of honesty, many people will appreciate this and it will help them. I will likely not use them either way. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:49:32
Every node is treated exactly the same. Maybe what you think of is that a early node is more likely to be more well connected, therefore others are more likely to want to connect to it.
For this I can't say, but there is alot of work being done on different ways to connect randomly to nodes in a way that benefits both the user and the network the most. 
At this moment in time it does not seem to be a problem atleast.

Agreed both are important. 
But a important point is if 50% of miners are turned off it doesn't ruin the network. Even if 50% of miners turn malicious they still can't change the rules of the nodes so there isn't much they can do unless they have something like 90% where they can start manipulating chainlength etc. But this will be spotted and their huge investment in this takeover will be nulified in some way. 
But it would suck.

Maybe. But the grassroots movement that spun up bitcoin is also what makes it strong. Is he gonna pay people to run nodes in a distributed matter? He's still a weak point then.

I set up lightning a few weeks ago just to try it out and buy some stickers. I have since used it 3-4 times even without looking for an excuse to do so. For instance buying steam voucher, when I do it on baselayer I have to wait for confirms. Now it was instant, and 100% secure. 
Scaling issues aside, LN is such a vast improvement over baselayer bitcoin payments.

His statement isn't about specific projects though. It's more of a general truth that if there's a point of centralization then the need to decentralize the rest of the network is useless. 
The need for a blockchain application is binary, it either requires full decentralization/trustlessness or it doesn't require it at all.

I'd say most people agree that monero is one of maybe 3-4 projects in this space that's actually interesting. But privacy can be solved ontop of bitcoin also. Sometimes privacy is a negative and sometimes it's something desireable.

He basically said he never came across with a problem that needed a private blockchain to be solved since there's always trust in some entity (development, mining, rules, nodes etc) so there's no point having a blockchain, might aswell use a database.

Your bitcoins are never replaced by something. 
You have a shared bitcoin account with someone else with a signed "exit transaction" from this adress so both of you can use the agreed upon exit transaction whenever you want. This is a totally normal bitcoin transaction _nothing else_.
The trick is that you don't transmit it but instead you keep it in your pocket. Then if both of you agree to update this exit transaction to reflect either you or your friend to get more out of it you can do this "under the table". No token exists, the bitcoins are still in the same place but one of you have the possibility to show the new bitcointransaction to the network and recieve more bitcoin then he did before. 
It's ONLY a totally normal bitcoin transaction that requires two signatures, it's NOTHING other. There is no token, you have misunderstood. 
You and me both sign a bitcointransaction where I get 1btc and you get 1btc. This is our entry transaction and the start of our "channel"(Channel just meaning that the funds cant be moved without both of our signatures, nothing else). We both put this transaction in our pocket and we dont show it to anyone.
Later I wanna buy something from you for 0.2 btc. We both agree and we both sign a new totally normal bitcoin transaction where I get 0.8btc and you get 1.2 btc out of our "shared bitcoin account", then we put this in our pocket and throw away the old one.
This can be repeated until someone dont want to anymore and then they take it from their pocket, and show it to the network. The bitcointransaction then moves the bitcoins in the way that we agreed last just like any normal bitcon transaction would. 0.8 to me and 1.2 to you in this example. There's nothing more to it, just totally normal bitcoin-transactions.
Btw, love the "rocket surgery" reference, I use that alot too :)

Intangible Factors 
from Reclamation Glossary (2012)
by U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation
Factors that affect a decision, but that cannot be expressed in monetary terms. Examples include employee morale, safety, system reliability, environmental effects, and politics.
Bitcoin possesses safety, system reliability and politics (If goverments were aware of cryptocurrencies before the general public they may have done things to shut it down before it gained traction, now they cant)
It also posseses many more not listed as those examples, such as some of the most talented people working to solve new usecases. If bitcoin is worth 0$ we can still run it to keep track of things trustlessly through colored coins or similar.

It's basically you take a 100$ bill and put it on a debit card using 1 onchain transaction. Then you can go around town spending from this debit card until the 100$ are spent, without doing any more onchain transactions, totally trustless and instant for a few satoshi in fee per LN-transaction. (Normal on chain fee for the loading into the "debit card")

I must have missed that, but then again I often don't watch those type of informative videos. 
Yes, I see the problem with that. But r/bitcoin might be interested in educational videos in general, educational videos are marketing after all. Most of us probably got hooked after either a very inspirational talk about monetary system, or after understanding the posibilities of the tech. 
This would just be to get alot of good content out there. The best ones could be linked by bitcoin.org they don't have to be produced specifically for them.

Isn't being able to send value between parties without anyone being able to stop you providing a value to someone somewhere and therefore of instrinsic value? That's a usecase that creates a value in the token. And since there's only a limited amount then that warrants a cost that rises/falls depending on demand/supply. As long as these things exist, the tokens will have a value. What is this value? I dont know.
"Bitcoin only has a value because people say it has value, making it identical to fiat in that respect." 
Sounds like gold since golds value would be very tiny if it was only used in industry. (jewlery in gold is only popular since it's expensive and tradition, there are alot prettier things we can do now)

Likely not a (part of) bitcoin though and even then it's a case of the colored coin you own increase or pays dividend not bitcoin itself. Drivechain / Sidechain secured through the btc network sure but it's the same thing where its not bitcoin price in general that increases but the stock that you own. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:59:05
I thought you ment price compared to actual onchain traffic(volume). Not sure if either are interesting though.
My prefered metric is fees paid for use, maybe average fees per day with a moving average of a month or whatever. It shows what people are willing to pay to use the chain, and therefor is a very good measure of value for the chain. Expensive to manipulate unless you own all the miners etc. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:16:42
The transactions themself require very little work but the chance of winning the lottery is very difficult. And has to get more difficult if more miners (ghz of computerpower) go in the lottery. It becomes more difficult so on average someone wins every 10min.

The reason the wealthy gets wealthier is because of compound interest. Once you have more money than you can spend your wealth will increase very quickly. 
If you have 100k "extra money", with 8% annual return you will have made an extra 100k on year 8. On year 12 you will have another 100k and year 15 another 100k. 
At year 25 you make 100k during that year.
And this is disregarding the fact that you made all these money somehow to begin with.

I agree with you no need to complicate the base layer. And just like you say, never tell anyone how much you have and keep a throw away adress well hidden. First you instantly give them your hot wallet. If they want more you very reluctnantly give them that and that's all you got. Maybe its 5% or 10% of your total, but it's worth your life/health.

Okay sure, that's valid points but it is already today, 9 months after segwit, possible for someone without any previous experience of unix or putting togeather parts for a rasbery pi or any other related knowledge to do it. There are stories about it all the time in this reddit. Some guy posted today that it took him about 8 hours but if he'd do it again he'd do it in maybe 2.
In some years there will be plug and play standalone boxes that you put the power cord in, it connects to your wifi and then it syncs up to your phone and you're done, ofcourse with open source software inside that you can audit if you want to. 
Most people today don't audit the code of their wallet, but the fact that it's open source means alot of other people do and if there's shananigans (such as electrum pro recently) it becomes well known very quickly.
We aren't there today that's for sure, but I don't see these as obstacles that stands in the way.

While I agree that sending small amounts isn't great atm, I'm still able to use bitcoin for large transactions alot cheaper then using a bank.
Bitcoin is not for buying cups of coffee, yet. It will be but we are not there yet. We also aren't where everybody is able to use it, but does this mean we have to increase the blocks to fit everything in for a cheap fee today? This would be multi gigabyte blocks, it's obviously not the route to go.
Technology have to be developed, tested, tested again and many times discarded cause it wasn't the correct solution. Alot of things are in the pipeline but these things take time. We would all love for btc to be ready for an everything-currency, but reality is it's not, and it won't be if we increase the blocks to 2mb or 8mb either. So let's have patience and make concervative changes.

@_date: 2017-08-23 04:13:33
schnorr signatures aren't possible without segwit, or atleast it requires a hardfork. Much better to approach is the other way around. 
No one is forced to use second layer, everyone is forced to download 4mb blocks.
If second layer fails for some unforseeable reason, it's easy to just not use them, if 4mb block fails, then what? Rollback to aug 1st? Start a new chain?
"Can't wrap their head around larger blocks" -- I Think ur being naive if you Believe that core don't understand the "concept" of bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:29:53
This was tried by bitcoin unlimited (I Think it was them)
The concern was that if one party (say miners, or a Company etc) gains from bigger blocks it would be easy to spam them bigger. I Believe there are some alts with unlimited blocksize but I cant say how it works. 
Blocksize is also needed so that people compete to get into blocks, since fees goes to miners and keeps them profitable to secure the chain, and also keeps them honest (monetary gain in relaying transactions). Unlimited blocks would lead to 0 cost transactions. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:34:12

well, lets take coffee as an example, you spend a certain amount on it at your local coffee shop each month. Each month you fill up your coffee cash into ur LN, and then you spend it during the month. If you also buy your food at the local store, you add your coffee money + food money each month, resulting in 1 transaction on the chain each month.

The reason to increase blocksize is to fit more information, here we fit the same amount of information with a blocksize decrease. This would in turn make every blocksize increase we do after this have a 1.8x multiplier. 
Example: 1mb = 1.8mb worth of transactions, 2mb = 3.6mb worth of transactions etc..

I suppose you should be able to verify yourself but not anyone else. That way you can crosscheck the number of how many people voted in total vs the votes for each party. If everyone goes and checks their own vote then there aren't any votes left to use for the fake IDs.
Basically if X = number of votes and people who checks their own vote is also X then number of available votes to manipulate is X - X = 0. 
Not everyone will check, but no one can know who will check and who won't. 
Like I said, I'm just thinking out loud
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:20:23
well, I suppose you are correct. What I ment is bitcoin isn't for everyone to buy coffee, yet. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 09:41:49
I agree with trilli0nn, if you can spam 1mb you can easily spam 2mb. I doubt many people actually left bitcoin. Many are here to trade and they can trade any coin they want, but these other coins see little actual use and their liquidity is nothing. 
Avg. fees paid is imo a great example of how much people value using the chain, it's actual money that they pay for the privilege.
Despite all this there wasn't a good option to choose to hardfork. We can't force anyone to develop a fork, and no competent developer wanted to do it since they didn't believe it was a good idea. Segwit2x was a laughably bad project, that if we would have gone for it would have totally ruined bitcoin since it actually failed to launch. The error was pointed out to garzic in the slackchannel aswell on github but he closed the issue. 
If it's incompetence (Wich I highly doubt since garzik is a amazing coder) or bad intention I can't say and it doesn't matter.

 I'm not aware of what fraud dept Overstock has so I can't comment on that. But how will you handle consumer protection without trusting someone in a push-currency? It's impossible. But trusting a entity of your choice is better then being forced to trust a entity, or to pay for a service you don't want.

I go out of my way to buy things for bitcoin though, if it's something I need. Most often the price is mostly the same on different sites for the same product, so I chose the one with bitcoin option.
I don't believe most people don't use their bitcoins. But if you're  new and you just bought them and it's not that much, you probably prefer to use your fiat first and see the bitcoin stash as a lottery ticket with good odds more or less.

Doesn't every one want infinite small blocks and infinite big blocks at the same time? It's just not possible, so where do we settle?
If I remember correctly the lukeJR proposal with 300kb and then growing at a certain rate over time was just a pull request he put in that didn't get adopted. There was alot of pressure at the time for a solution that solved the scaling issue and he was nice enough to draft one. At the time there was no fee pressure and 1mb blocks might have been too big, or too small, it's not an exact science. Luke made a proposal, it wasn't adopted. I don't even believe he was all that for it but some parts of the community was very loud about wanting it. 
Should it have started at 1mb instead of 300kb? Maybe. 
Why didn't anyone draft such a pullrequest? Not sure. 
Would it have been adopted? Likely not.

What you don't take into account is that if there's 1gb of space available for 1sat/byte then usecases will explode. People will do 100s of satoshis-place paintings, play pokemon with pay per click etc. If blocks are 1gb tomorrow, they are likely filled within a few weeks.
And no, we can't trust miners to only include the transactions they deem worth it because A) Miner incentive is profit, not well being of network. B) Miners already include 1sat/byte so it's apparantly something they want to do.  
Also, 1gb blocks aren't even close to enough for what I envision for bitcoin longterm

Well done and good for you. And sure, it's a strawman but it's a way to show that your n=1 sample size also doesn't prove anything. It's however quite clearly proven that TA does not work, and absolutely not for most people. If you have enough capital to move the market to fit your wanted narrative, like pushing the price below a certain TA line and make everyone else sell into you etc then you can make it work. Some studies in the field:
"According to a paper by Hoffmann and Shefrin, traders and investors that rely on technical analysis, significantly underperform the broader market.
This study looked at the records and survey responses of 5,500 traders in the Netherlands from a discount broker, between 2000-2006.
The results suggest that by using technical analysis, investors and traders lost 50 basis points per month from poor portfolio selection and a further 20 basis points from transaction costs.
Generally speaking, those that used technical analysis would have been better off simply allocating their cash to an index fund."
Then there is this paper from Smith, Wang, Wang and Zychowicz (  )that states that TA does work for professional institutions when sentiment and volatility is high(like bitcoin atm) but no difference when sentiment was low. They also increase their risk in doing so, wich you have to take into account when evaluating the returns. 
But the problem with this statement is that obviously people that dont trade lose alot of money when the market goes down(high sentiment). However the problem is knowing when it goes down, and when it will turn back. If you look back and select a period of poor performance like this study does, then yes TA might have been better.
Just out of interest, what system do you use? I don't wanna disregard your ability or your past performance in any way. Getting a 75% incrase in a bear market is very well done.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:38:18
I'll explain for you no problem.
There are two types of double spend in bitcoin, 0-conf and after confirmations. 
0-conf means that someone accepts the coins as recieved before they are included in a block. This situation is very easy to double spend you just send 1 bitcoins towards one adress, and before it is confirmed you send the same bitcoin to a second adress with a higher fee. The coin ends up in the second adress only and this is the valid transaction(the real deal). The bitcoin do not end up in the first adress, so there's still only one bitcoin and no counterfeited bitcoin. 
The second works by sending the same bitcoin to a new adress after it's been included in a block (call it block 0). You then proceed to mine the same height as block 0, but with your new transaction included in this block. If you after some time are able to create a longer chain ontop of this "false block" you then reorg the chain since bitcoin follows the longest valid chain. This is called a 51% attack and the coin will be in the second adress, and not in the first adress, since according to the reorged bitcoin ledger the first transaction never occured. 
Either way there will never be a second bitcoin so there's only a bitcoin in the second adress, no counterfeit bitcoin per the definition of the word "counterfeit".
Consider the fact that the bitcoin ledger is only a collection of UTXO's that point back to a previous UTXO all the way back to the creation of that coin. This is what makes it impossible to duplicate a coin. If it was possible I could just double spend into my own wallet and have millions of bitcoins by tomorrow. 
You gave some great advice about listening to others, you should take it.

While I agree 100% I honestly prefer making a LN payment over visa payment online. The user experience is just better. Snap a picture of the screen and its done, instead of going to get my creditcard and typing in numbers etc.

@_date: 2018-06-17 09:01:07
So trying out a route takes less then a second, if payment fails you still haven't sent anything anywhere.
You actually never send anything anywhere until you close the channel. Think of it more like a signed contract. 
You and me open a channel with 1btc each. This can be seen as you and me signing a contract stating that in this combined adress, I'm entitled to 1 btc, and you are entitled to 1btc. 
When we make our first transaction, say I send 0.3 btc to you, we then sign a new contract stating that I'm entitled to 0.7btc and you are entitled to 1.3btc, this is also timestamped so it's not question wich is the valid one. 
The whole chain of updated signed contracts can only be signed if all contracs are signed, so there is no waiting if something goes wrong. Either everyone signes a new contract all the way to the end and the payment is made, or no one signes and you can instantly try another route.
The lockout time is only used if you wanna leave LN and get the funds from a channel into your baselayer wallet. 
There are two situation with this. One where we both agree, and one where we don't.
When closing we both display our latest contract(state) to the network. If these are matching then the channel is closed instnatly, and we both recieve our respective funds into our base layer adress(wallet)
If we do not agree, or one tries to cheat then the lockout time is useful.
If I try to transmit the first contract wich says I'm entitled to 1btc and you to 1btc (A profit for 0.3btc on my part), I will have to wait either until you agree on the state (wich you wont) or until the lockout period is through, normally its two weeks. So you have two weeks to provide a newer state. If your node connects to the internet during this time this will happen automatically.
If you now broadcast the newer state, where you get 1.3 and I get 0,7 btc this proves to the network that I tried to cheat and the network punishes me by giving you everything in the channel, all the 2btc.

I think almost everyone I've seen wants bigger blocks eventually, they just wanna see how well second layer can solve it for us instead of increasing blocks.
If second layer solutions doesn't work out it's very easy to abondon them, just don't use them. If blocks get bigger, they will be in the chain forever. And going down the road to 4mb blocks still wont be enough for any real useage, we would need gigabyte size blocks for real mainstream adoptions, so many people realize this isn't feasable and other solutions are needed.

Price would have to double for the same $return / block. 
Either that happens, or some miners will feel like it's not worth it to mine anymore and shut of. Resulting in a lower difficulty level and more reward / hashrate.
Fees are intended to take over, and there has already been blocks with up to 13btc fee reward. Now this isn't healthy atm but as you say, with lightning the individual fee will be able to be alot higher than today.
If I can transact 100 times through 1 LN channel I'd be happy to pay 99 times todays transaction fee when creating the channel, I'm still ahead of where we are today. Likely it won't come to that but it wouldn't be strange, the incentives for the user are there. That would result in about 20btc fee / block.
Likely it will be a combination of price increase if bitcoin is still around in 4/8 years etc, smarter ofchain solutions that makes it more worth it to use the base layer per instance, or miners dropping out. Note that better mining equipment can also help keep the hashrate the same for the same $ cost for the miner, so if miners become twice as good and mining reward goes to half then total hashrate stays the same.
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:58:56
For baselayer sure, however anyone can create a layer ontop that can provide for instance consumer protection or whatever else that you want. And they will charge you for this, just with alot more healthy competition.

Ofcourse people like that exist. Like I said everyone want infinite small blocks and infinite large blocks at the same time. I believe you refer to the tweet where he states that :"PSA: If you support reducing the block size (good for Bitcoin), avoid using Segwit for normal transactions. Only use Segwit for Lightning. ��"
It's very true and informative regardless of one persons opinion. Using a segwit transaction increases the blocksize, not everyone wants to do that and they should be made aware of the fact. Others who don't mind increasing the blocksize are ofcourse free to adopt segwit adresses and he says nothing about that.
Now Luke is a very colorful individual but he's also a very brilliant coder, (He was the one who figured out segwit could be a softfork). He has his opinions but he really doesn't force them on anyone else as far as I've encountered. He believes that the blocks at this point in time are too large, honestly with the fees we're seeing atm he might be correct. But we have the 1mb limit (1million weight unit) in place and it would be silly to fork to a lower now just to increase it later, so most agree just keep it.
and in any case, Luke isnt equal to "bitcoin core people"

Exactly, but if you remove the POW aspect like your link assumed then you no longer have trustless cryptographic linking.
Incentives is what keeps the 50% hashpower attack implausible. If one miner has 50% hashpower he still can't reliably pull of double spends. And if he tries, what happens to the value of bitcoin and the 900 bitcoins he recieves per day in mining reward? He's much better of not doing it and that's why it's safe.
Also the point you miss is that if you still trust an entity then you may aswell use a trusted database to do everything you want. 
Please provide an example if you believe I'm incorrect in this.

Testing a route takes a fraction of a second. Once I had a difficult time finding a route so it took like 15 seconds but usually it's a sub 3 second deal. Alot of work is currently being done on this process from many different development teams. 
It's important to understand that we do want the best route, but it's not that important, a sub optimal route works almost just as well. (Maybe 1 satoshi extra in fees but everything else the same)
Nodes in the middle can do whatever they want(except keeping the btc they are sent), but if they delay time you just don't route throug them so it's their loss. They have nothing to gain from that. The HTLC is just for your channel, and the timeout period is just for settling your channel state back on baselayer. 
I think the point you might have missed is that if you send btc through LN to me, I dont actually recieve your bitcoins, I recieve bitcoins from the person I'm connected to. Bitcoins dont travel through the network, think of it more like an abacus where each row is a channel and at the end of the row there's a new row (another channel).
So if we send 1 btc from A to C through a process that looks like this (A)-&gt;(B)-&gt;(C) it means that A gives 1btc to B, B can only recieve this 1BTC if he sends his previously owned BTC to C, so B ends up with the BTC from A, and C ends up with the BTC that B originally had. I feel like maybe I'm not explaining this very well but hopefully you get it. 
The balance sheet afterwards would look something like [A:-1btc] [B:+1btc-1btc] [C:+1btc] Ofcourse ignoring the fee that B would recieve
Please ask a follow up question and I'll answer since I feel like I'm not doing a great job atm ;)

The first transaction (from party A) will be timelocked once it's already included in the block, so CPFP isn't applicable there.

Because the price of bitcoin is that much higher, miners always go for profit since they are in the business of making money. That's why we can't trust miners to always have our best interest at heart when it comes to technical discussions or upgrades.
Their hardware has a year top of time before it burns out, they wanna make as much money as they can during this time and they aren't that bothered what happens in 2-3 years time.

That's not a double spend. There are 5 types of double spends in bitcoin, Race attack, Finney attack, Vector76 attack ,Alternative history attack and Majority attack (51%). 
Transmitting an old state is neither of these per the definition of the term and if you want to discuss issues or topics you need to have taken the time to educate yourself about the topic first. Else you are just wasting everyones time. Likely that is your motive though.

Yes, but the technology that is just blockchain is just a chain of blocks, block being a update of the distributed ledger. The word may be new but there's nothing revolutionary in this if you take it away from the rest of the context. 
I suppose we argue semantics about the word, but my point is if we remove POW and concensus from blockchain then it's not much to shout about
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:39:11
Blockchain-style protocols.
Blockchain is just a ledger, it's ancient technology. A distributed ledger is just a copy of that same ledger spread among many people. 
The inovation of Nakamoto's blockchain is the trustless nature without a central authority, provided by the POW just like kayleepop stated. If you remove POW then you so far introduce trust, despite what that "academic who know their shit" says. And if there's trust required, then there are better solutions then blockchain.
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:38:47
Your first sentence proves my point so I guess you agree with me given the emperical evidence of the mempool these last few months.
Bitcoin does not have a roadmap since it's a community driven effort where the best proposals get chosen. At one point, one developer tried to write up a roadmap, it was very much critizesed since it was viewed as it might become a central autority on the direction of development and that does not belong in bitcoin. 
If you say bitcoin will never increase blocksize then that will mean that increasing the blocksize is never the best route and that would indeed be amazing since the problems have been solved in other ways.

You are correct it is in there, and since the funds are locked in a 2by2 timelocked multisig adress they will never be double spent since settlement in a multisig just like any bitcoin transaction is a binary state, and it's protected by the lockout period. You can also use RBF or CPFP to get your correct transaction into a block.

You don't seem to not understand that there is no second copy of the double spent bitcoin so therefore there is no counterfeit "item"
There is two entries at the same time in the mempool, but at this point the bitcoins that you say are counterfeited are still in the sending adress. Once it's included in a block, they are only in this one new adress, not both. So there is never a counterfeit produced. There is a fraudulent behavior though. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 08:16:33
No, since segwit moves signatures outside is what is allowing the 1mb+ size. Reduce the signature size and we have the same amount of transactions as a full segwit block, but reduce this full segwit block to 1mb. So same amount of transactions but blocks are 1mb instead of ~1.8mb

While I agree with your point, the fact that your smartphone will handle the payment it has alot of ways to be more intuitive and less likely to cause these problems.

@_date: 2018-06-16 18:31:50
(No idea what happened with the formating of this post, hope you get it anyways
I'll answer to the best of my ability
1. A pays a fee to each node for transmitting the payment, B sets its own fee that it wants to charge and A choses the cheapest route that he finds.
1 (again). When A wants to transmit a transaction he asks all his peers if they know of a route to C, then they ask their routes etc and the request propagates through the network. A node that's been online for a while may know his surroundings a bit, but not all the network. The network also constantly changes so it's not worth it to keep track of it. There may be different ways of solving this issue since it's very much a work in progress by multiple implementations atm. 
2. Yes, you can make your own route hidden. But the real solution is to always have 2-3 channels open. That way if you are B in a (A) -&gt;(B)-&gt;(C) situation and A sends to C to exhaust your B-&gt;C 
channel that means he just refilled your B-&gt;A channel and you can pay in that direction instead. 
3. The states are not changed until a payment is made. If it fails to route then that just means nothing never happened. 
4. It tries to find a new route, or it's a failed payment and you can try again instantly. 
Timelock is mostly never ever used. The only time the timelock is needed is if someone tries to cheat. Consider the situation Alice and Bob both have 1btc in each of their sides of a channel. 
Alice buys something from Bob for 0.5btc so the channel states are 
Alice 0.5BTC 
Bob 1.5BTC
Now alice broadcasts the intitial state in wich they would recieve 1btc each. Now Bob has the time of the Timelock to dispute this state and broadcast a newer state wich proves that alice tried to cheat. In this situation the network realize that Alice was trying to cheat and will punish Alice by giving Bob all the btc in the channel (2btc)
@_date: 2018-06-01 10:47:45
This is the correct answer. We don't need the best route, we need a good enough rote. Since fees are sub satoshi per hop, I really can't see a reason to not just take a 4hop instead of a 3hop if it's easier.

1 You get asked if you have any information about the endpoint always, I dont have any stats on how demanding this is and I'm in no way an expert on routing since it's not really solved yet. Check out each repositorys logs and discussions on how they go about solving it. There isn't a industry standard to point to atm. 
2  exactly
3  No time at all, it doesn't exactly work that way there is a secret sent along that cryptographically enforces that everyone actually does send to the endpoint else there are no transactions ever made. I did watch a presentation on it but cryptography is very complicated so while I understood what he said, I can't explain it in detail. But basically, you can't cheat in this manner. Lightning is totally trustless. Either your payment goes through like you want to, or it doesn't and you keep all your funds.

Mining centralization is an issue, but I do believe it will get better, either way the only power a miner has is to do its job and earn money, or destroy (for a while) bitcoin and have all your revenuestream and investment disapear.

@_date: 2017-11-11 21:32:31
Ok sure, this was a reasonable comment. 
"Politics" or anyone by themself can change the bitcoin protocol, this will result in a fork. However they can not dictate what software I run, if I want to I will never change the rules that I wanna follow. 
This is probably the most difficult concept of bitcoin to grasp, and requires the incentives to be shaped so that everyone always can act in their best self interest. At this point, it is clear to me that people do not want to raise the blocklimit through a rushed hardfork such as s2x. If some want to, they are free to move there at forkdate, I will not, since its my choice what software I run.
Since I'm a user, I will also mostly have the same preferences in chosing software as most other users, therefore I will always find myself on the bigger chain, and on the bigger chain will be the businesses, since they make money of users. This will give the biggest value of the coin to this chain, so the miners will want to mine there.
Also I've stated a few times that scaling linear through blocksize increase is useless, 2mb blocks will be filled within a week and we are still where we are now. If your main goal with bitcoin is to have the price increase, sure 2mb might be good for a short time increase.
For me I care that the technology is developed and that the base layer is as secure as possible. A limit in blocksize forces businesses and developers to think of other ways to solve this problem, and fules innovation. 
This researchpaper for instance shows that we could increase transaction throughput by up to 20 times, and still keep 1mb blocks.
And this is just one of many exciting things comming to bitcoin in the comming years
These are the things I'm excited about.

If bitcoin is centralized it looses what makes it special, in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:35:44
People can play politics, bitcoin protocol does not care.
We can do 8million wu blocks today, it will increase centralization and it will not make bitcoin perform any better. This is all in the link I provided you and I also wrote a different explanation in a previous post so I'm not gonna explain it to you again.
Now you yourself admitted that you knew mostly about the "political situation" but you didn't know about bitcoin tech. How you can form a opinion about who is right or wrong without understanding the tech, I dont know. But you are free to think in whatever way you like. I wish you luck.

None of these chains solve the problem, they just don't have the problem cause no one uses them.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:33:34
Or you dont close it and send them to someone else through LN, it's exciting for sure to think about.
I think my main point is that there will be so many "hubs" that every time you wanna send a transaction somewhere it can choose 100s of paths there, and it will automatically chose the cheapest one, so a single entity will have no power what so ever to disrupt it
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:02:47
There's also a factor of people using onchain smarter since there's a fee market, prior I'd send very small amounts every day, now I'll send once a week or once a month instead. It doesn't matter alot to me I still have the same functionality I just use it a bit differently.

if you create your own between a friend then it can be separate, but once you (or your friend) decides it's worth it to have a channel to some fairly popular company, your network will be merged with most likely the rest of the world.

adding money requires a transaction on the blockchain. Look at it like you have a spending wallet each month to pay for groceries, cofee etc.. you can top this up and then use it to buy the stuff that you usually buy during the month, so you'd only use the blockchain once per month..
Remember that in a real scenario your 1 LN channel will most likely be connected to pretty much anyone who also uses LN

If the company that gives out CME futures does not itself buy the same amount of bitcoin (They almost certainly do not, but they likely hedge it somehow) I would NOT take this bet.. if bitcoin actually does go "to the moon™", the company will not be able to pay all people that wants to withdraw their balance.

I'll just chime in and say in term of marketcap, its way biggest but many alts also have high market caps. Imo it's very unimportant to measure this but you will see this argument alot that other coins are "gaining".

Once inside the LN you as a LN user can process other peoples transactions and gain a fee from it (or do it for free), the LN transaction will take the path of least resistance (meaning cheapest).
To get your bitcoin into a LN adress, you need to register it on the blockchain, there will likely be a fee for this that goes to the miners
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:19:16
I use this site: 
to check what fee to use, and I usually try to go very low if it's not a time sensitive send (Wich I feel bitcoin never is), many times the recommended fee was 240-260 satoshi/byte and I sent for 10 satoshi/byte and it confirmed same day or next day. 
Worth to note is, if your fee is so low that it does not get included for a set amount of time (I believe 3 days) you get the bitcoin back to the same adress that they were sent from, so you don't have to worry about that.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:24:53

Bitcoin has scaled, if anyone chose to use this is up to them. If you want to use it you will chose to interact with someone else who can use it, so these business will adopt it or get less volume.

"Political situation" is something created by people who didn't get their way and has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin, wich is concensusbased meaning everyone can do whatever they want to, no need for politics.
its true we can most likely do "2mb" (8million WU) blocks today and be fine, just a bit more decentralized especially many years from now since blockchain will grow at double speed, but why would we?
I think the best analogy is internet speed, the more speed (more room in blockchain) the more usecases we will have. 1990 internet didn't contain images, cause there wasn't bandwidth for it. Once bandwidth increased websites started containing images and internet capacity was filled up. Now we stream HD video. Fees will stay the same cause it's what people want to pay to make a transaction, now and tomorrow. 
Scaling linear will never work for bitcoin to become mainstream. I dont know if that is "technical issue", it's 4th grade math at best.
This was posted more then a year ago, and probably says it better then I ever can, give it a read.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:55:22
Anyone can "decide bitcoins roadmap" you are free to do it also. The tricky part is getting people to follow you and for this you need to prove your ideas and gain consensus. Bitcoin only works if everyone does whatever they want.

its fine but it might be easy to make some kind of mistake at some point. But so long as you don't wanna move anything it is fine to leave them, you will always have them. 
You can google a guide how to do it, and just take your time to understand the steps and what you are doing. You will most likely learn alot about how bitcoin works in the process.

The fact that Hal Finney lived a few blocks away from Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto is quite too much of a circumstance :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:08:37
Miners choose wich transactions they include in a block, it is smart for them to include the transactions with the highest fee, cause that will give them the most money.
The value (bitcoin amount) of your transaction does not matter, only the size of your transaction (in bytes) and how much you are willing to pay per byte.
Once the block is full the miner can not include any more transactions, so if you pay more you have a bigger chance of getting into the next block, if you pay less you might have to wait until all higher fee payments has been processed.

You are asking others what to do about a topic where no one can possibly know the outcome, it shows a low understanding of basic market principles.
Note it's not a lack of understanding of bitcoin, wich you may or may not have, you are asking a question about market psychology which has no answer. Anyone who has an answer to your question is not someone you should listen to.

Sure, my point is if price of the medium is your endgame, then this might matter. If the function is your endgame, price does not matter.
And the fact is that price will follow function, in the long term atleast, you can push a baloon below water, but if you stop applying pressure to it it will float up

it's still registered on the blockchain, just in bulk. You still own your own money, privacy actually increases. These are the two best parts about bitcoin and they remain even with second layer

You can chose to trust a provider or to run your own node, we need to make it as easy as possible to do the later for bitcoin to be healty.

It's up to the coffe shop (or any other participant) to close the channel when they want to, I imagine the cofee shop also does not want to pay more fees than it wants, so it might settle once a month to cover bills, alot better then 100 times a day.
There are alot of good comments already in this thread, but the easy answer is you can not withdraw money that you have spent. The only thing you can do is settle the transactions onchain, then you will recieve what is left in your LN adress and the coffee chain will get what is left in theirs. Someone else probably explained it better.
Added: Also the shop has incentive to keep channels open for as long as possible, since that might make you choose to shop there instead of going to a competitor since it means you dont have to open a new LN channel. That's why it fits bitcoin so well, it's in everyones best interest to do the best for eachother, worst case scenario is you find another shop and make 1 transaction on the chain
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:58:13
Bitcoin and blockchain technology was almost exactly the same in 2013, atleast to the average user
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:24:47
Yes that is true, but those are still your bitcoins, if you have them in a LN channel or in cold storage would make no difference to you as long as you dont need them, and once you do need them you can spend them right away, so I don't see your point. 
In any way it isn't a cost like you described it, if anything you'd get some compensation (kind of like interest) if you help with relaying transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:55:20
I'd say most business don't have a clue what LN is, even if they heard of bitcoin, the best way for these things to happen is organically. Let people passionate about LN develop it, when it proves itself (or not) people will start using it if they want to, and so will businesses.

The point you are missing is that you, and miners, and anyone else is free to do exactly as you like. Bitcoin protocol is open source. The only time bitcoin works is when everyone does whatever they want. 
A group just tried S2X, wich raises the blocklimit. A proposal that has alot of support, but they executed it in a truly poor way (No other fixes while doing a hf, rushed timing, not seeking consensus), so people chose not to follow it.
Miners choose where to mine, they will always act in self interest and mine where they get the most profit. I will keep my coins where they are the safest because I believe this will give them the bigger value (And also let me hang on to them).
There is also a huge misunderstanding that miners offered to agree to segwit, there was aboslutely no way for miners to keep blocking it once core proposed bip 91 , the only option they had, that they still have and everyone else always has, was to fork of (or let the coreclient and people following them fork of) the chain.
There is no voting mechanism, therefore no politics, just like there is no voting mechanism in choosing between mcdonalds or wendys, you just go where you want to and if no one choses wendys, they go bankrupt. Both wendys and mcdonalds can try to market themselfs, but that's not "politics", it's capitalism.
Also you chose to not respond to the "technical issue" that actually was my whole point of my comment in taking my time to try to explain to you something that you wanted an answer to, but you don't want to hear that, you make your mind up while totaly uninformed, then run around spreading this opinion like gospel.

A better hedge vs inflation is companies, since they sell stuff based on the same currency they are inflation protected. Companies also yield returns wich bitcoin does not.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:48:21
First off deflation is very bad for an economy since people are incentivesed to save instead of spending. Spending fuels the economy and makes it grow.
However my comment was imo very clearly stating that people do NOT stop buying things just because they can get "more" a year from now. I made a clearly faulty statement to prove the point. 
Also bitcoin has no function that makes it deflationatory, just because it goes up in value compared to fiat atm does not mean it will always. At this point even bitcoin is inflationary, only in a predictable and steady way, and once all coins are mined, its still not deflationary, its just steady. The increase in value these last couple of months has nothing to do with this however.

They can chose wich transactions to include, but the better thing would in this case be to chose not to include any transactions at all (mine empty block)
They want normal people to pay more for a transaction and then include that into the block, since then they get more money for mining the block (I dont know who is spamming the mempool, but they are a likely suspect)

Ofcourse not, but if you want returns on your money, then you can not keep bitcoin, bitcoin is a currency, just like you say..

You have mixed terminology.. centralization means a whole other thing then off-chain, it's not even related. 
Offchain transactions can be very decentralized, like the examples in this paper. Or they can be very centralized, perhaps for very small transactions, or if you **chose** to trust someone.

1) You decide how much you lock into your channel, the recieving person in the channel does not have to add anything to it so this is a faulty assumption.  Edit: Actually I read your comment again and its true if you want to also recieve through this they have to have them added (or not moved what you spent), but like the faq says their money isnt really tied up just for being in the LN
2) Running a node is all that's required, and by transmitting this penalty transactions makes you risk all of the funds in the channel so it most likely will not happen unless they KNOW you dont monitor the chain.
Bitcoin requires people to take responsibility about security, it's the same as normal blockchain. There are wallets that helps you keeping track of the blockchain through a 3rd party (light clients), these are less secure for this reason already. This will be similar.
3) This talk about "hubs" is not in my opinion how things will work at all. I will be connected to my favorite exchange, I will also be connected to somewhere that I buy things, a local store but also perhaps amazon.com. 
This way I will be able to route to everyone who is connected to my exchange, and everyone who is connected to amazon. 
So the exchange is what you call a "hub", amazon.com is a "hub", not some company that runs "hubs". 
If I wanted to shop at overstock.com, LN will automatically route me through for example my exchange, to someone who is connected between my exchange and overstock, if there are 0 connections here, LN will automatically open a new one. It will become a huge mesh network with 100s of routes to choose from, not exactly what I would call centralization.

The question isn't how convenient it is, it's how difficult it is from a technical standpoint, downloading apps, buying coins etc.
I'd say its a 6, mostly the buying bitcoins part is the difficult one. If you can get some sent from a friend then it's maybe a 4? Its really not more difficult than any other app with QR codes.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:21:17
Well sure, but then the original point stands, that they lose everything in the channel.
Situation A) Channel to themself: They don't lose anything, but they also gain nothing.
Situation B) Channel to someone else: They lose the funds.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:00:48
Yes but you have to realize this. You gotta keep the fee of every transaction getting into a block HIGHER then the channelstate that you wanna win. This means that you pay more to the miner then you stand to gain. And if I have a channel with 0.01 btc, you have to keep the lowest FEE at 0.01 for more for 2.7 MILLION transactions else I will CPFP my newer state out and you LOSE money. That's 27000 btc that you are guaranteed to lose in miner fees. 
In a break even scenario you have 27000btc tied up in channels to you that all have balance below 0.01 wich means basically having more than 10-20 million channels open at a single time (Not all will have exactly 0.01 some will be lower, the higher ones will get out). Just opening all these channels will also cost you... yea I dont see the point in doing more math. It's clear it's not possible. I however learned some things about LN during this discussion so something good came out of it for sure.
Second point even though attack vector isn't real:
If people have less money it might mean they want lower locktime, I just think it will mean their balance will be lower. Maybe a combination. Shorter locktime is ofcourse less secure, but it's still very very secure as long as you're monitoring your state. 
Note that you can close a channel if both parties agree at any point, then you wont have to wait for the locktime. The locktime is only to protect you, and if someone tries to trick you you always want longer locktime. Opening channels with friends and business you transact with will solve this problem. 
Edit: 
Two more things that I actually learnt and wanna share. 
If I monitor the mempool and see my own old transaction show up, since it's set with say 10sat/byte I can instantly broadcast my newer one with 11sat/byte  (or 100sat/byte whatever I want), ensuring that the faulty transcation never hits the blockchain and that also totally negates this attack since it means that everyone doing this wins the "nothing at stake fund". So while you pump out your 10-20 million 10sat/byte transactions I will have plenty of time to respond and get your money.
Since miners choose what transactions to include (They most often go for the highest since that gives them money) but in this case they might want to do well, so you can contact slushpool for instance with your newer state and prove it to them, and they can include this with 0sat/byte out of good will or whatever, and the attacker is again screwed.

Yea, many parts of africa already uses a payment system that uses text messages to update a central database, I dont remember the name right now. They also trade in GSM refill cards and use this as transferable value since they can send the refill codes to eachother in lieu of a bank service. For them the step to using bitcoin is way more natural than it is for us, and much more needed
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:24:53
You are correct, a database solution is always superior, as long as you are allowed to use it and you can (want to) trust whoever runs it. Bitcoin solves many things that are favorable over having banks do this, and my point is it can solve these things AND be user friendly, in a not too distant future. 
My point from start was it doesn't matter what currency the app uses, all the ease of use things that the app has, can be the same on a bitcoin app.
I'm also not saying it will replace other solutions, especially not in such a safe country as denmark. But I'm saying your arguments that bitcoin atm is not as user friendly as this payment app is not a big concern for me.
We have the same app where I'm from, its called swish here and its free atm but there will be a fee in the future (was supposed to be this year but they postponed it)

The concept is "nothing at stake" and like bitbug explained the hacker still kept 1 satoshi in his side of the channel, this is what the hacker lost. Numbers are obviously made up.
You can set your nothing at stake limit to something that's high enough to incentivice honestly, but low enough to not cause issues. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:20:09
LN devs and segwit devs are two different things completely. Segwit does lower fees, whenever you use segwit you get a discount. But I'm sure you know this. 
Also either if you use segwit or not fees are atm 1sat/byte and get into the next block often. But I'm sure you know this also. 
Well if you are just sitting around waiting for other people to solve things for you, then why don't you do it yourself. If waiting is unacceptable. At the moment you are the kid in the back screaming "Are we there yet?" to his parents every 2minutes.
No blockchain has a proof of having solved the scaling issue. Let me know wich chain you prefer and we can make an atomic swap contract that gives you the coin of your choice vs you give me the same amount in bitcoin in 2 years time. I'm all for it.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:26:42
Ok, so how does the fact that they won't transact in bitcoin affect the banking industry? That was the topic 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:38:59
It's hardcoded into segwit that it lowers the fee/kb, I dont know how you can misunderstand that unless you try really hard or have no idea at all what you are talking about.
1sat/byte regularly gets cleared within a few blocks, imo its way too cheap to use the scarce resource that is a distributed ledger. Basically you're saying that you want everything and you want it for free. Fee level will be a tradeoff between price and difficulty to run a node (decentralization). You take decentralization for granted until you don't have it anymore, and then it's too late.  
No blockchain has a working concept that solves anything beyond what bitcoin does. You care so much about picking the "winner" that you don't understand what this is about at all. Crypto is not about your fiat gains. If anyone solves the problem I'm happy, but lets be clear, no one is in a better spot atm then bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:08:03

You can already add a transaction to the blockchain using text message. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:44:56


I really don't understand this statement, why would it be true?
Situation A) They are ok with holding bitcoin
They will most definately want a customer to open a channel to them cause then it's easier to return to them for your next coffe purchase
Situation B) They only want $
They use an API like bitpay or coinbase and you have your channel open to this service instead of the shop and the shop recieves their payment from the service provider.
Is there a situation C where I go into a shop to buy something, and when making my transaction I choose to connect to a random node so that it can relay the payment, rather than opening a direct channel?
The above obviously is a situation where you make the decision to open a new channel. If you already have a channel, then this situation happened before and you are still obviously not connected to this random node already, since there's no point. Ever.
No matter how low their fees are, it's not lower to hop through them than to not do it, there's no incentive model that encourages the behavior that makes this attack viable
Also don't get me wrong, it's good that you're thinking about attack vectors and I realize you are actually just concerned and not trying to spread FUD. It's great that people hear these theories and it's even better that we get great responses to them kind of like thieflars response that shows that it really wans't anything to be concerned about to begin with.
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:52:56
1) true, but if you shop something you already trust the shop to deliver. With a creditcard they can double charge you, or charge you at a later date etc, this is not possible with bitcoin so I'd argue a in person purchase is safer using bitcoin. Not sure what mobilepay uses, but it's not better then bitcoin, maybe its the same.
2) You can add your phonenumber and use it as your adress, this is super easy and it's already what you have done (link your phonenumber to your account in the pay app) just do it for bitcoin also.
3) Yes, but neither you nor the store actually cares that its bitcoin or DRK, just that he gets paid and you get your product and you both are safe doing so, the store will pay less in fees (wich you pay in the end) so there's some gain wich will help push adoption
4) what if mobilepay is up to some weird stuff and they go into bankrupcy? Like I said I dont know how it works but could you lose money / lose atleast your ability to pay for things?
TL:DR bitcoin is difficult to use today, but the difficult part in getting this to work is already solved now we just gotta have people make user friendly interfaces. This takes time but it's not the thing that can fail.

All LN channels have an expiration date, so you will have to wait for this time to get your bitcoins sent back to you. During this time you are voulnerable to the 2nd(edited mistake) party that can transact a previous channel state that is in his favor.

Very few bitcoin nodes are in china.  , despite bitcoin has truly proven to not be easily changed or influenced. The thing the side chain needs is stake in the game, monetary stake to make incentives align.
If you want to use a court of law to enforce things, then why would you ever want to put anything in a blockchain? It makes no sense. The point of a blockchain is that it keeps people honest by incentives. Keeping track of things is best done in a database.
An established working product will be developed for this type of application ontop of bitcoin if there is ever a need for it. You are eager to have this today already up and running and its true it isn't done today, but second layer / sidechain solutions doesn't need to follow bitcoin development. With segwit they are possible to deploy by your own dev team and then take advantage of bitcoins security model. Bitcoin is not holding you back in any way in this manner and I bet many people are already looking at this. 
And again, obviously a company WANTS control over whatever they invest in. I'm not arguing this. But if a company has control over something, then it is inferior to bitcoin for everyone else except this company. And if one entity has control over it, then it's not worth anything as a blockchain, its just a slow impractical database.

No you don't extend the trust chain, there is NO trust in LN.
0 conf isn't the same thing as a LN transaction.. you can try to double spend a 0 conf but you can't double spend a LN transaction.
You can't double spend inside our channel since I wont sign your double spend and it's never a thing, you won't have a valid transaction other then the ones I agree with.
(As far as I know, please link some documentation about this if its the case or you mean something else).
A signed transaction inside lightning is at 0 risk and its value is 100%, since you can instantly use it to buy something for exactly 100% of the value.

Yes this is likely how it will work, you can have your account as your phonenumber and easy text uses like "Pay 100 followed by phonenumber" in a message to your SPV and he recieves 100 satoshi etc if you only have a old style mobile, or a GUI if you have a better phone, they can work togeather.

Not bitcoin base protocol obviously, but something that takes advantage of bitcoins secuirty model. Anything that runs on ethereum can be run on bitcoin on a sidechain,  in time. But sure, run it on ethereum if you prefer today. It will however not handle the amount of traffic you need. 
If maersk introduces this then they are a point of failure since they will have control of nodes, development etc. This is obviously good enough for most things, but it's not as good as bitcoin.

So in this scenario the USB has malware included from when it's manufactured that survived a formatation of the memory? I dont know if this is possible, perhaps it is, the only piece of hardware that can store something and broadcast it later via the internet is the harddrive though, the usb itself isn't connected ever again.

Thanks for taking time out of your day to take time to respond to this nonsense
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:27:14
I really don't agree. But it's just a terminology difference. 
An IOU is a promiss of delivering something, it requires trust. A signed bitcoin transaction can in theory be viewed as an IOU on the base layer, since one adress owes another adress a future payment. But in practice it's more like it's already settled since I can even spend it and it requires 0 trust.
Think like this. I have a unpaid bill from person A that he promissed to pay at the end of the month. This is an IOU. But I need the money TODAY so I wanna sell the IOU for someone else to collect. For several reasons this IOU wont sell for 100% of the value. (risk, locked money etc)
A pre signed bitcoin transaction (Or LN transaction) is worth its exact value. This maybe isn't theoretically correct, but it's correct in practice.

The only worry is writing something to the harddrive and save it there. Tails is not allowed to do this, anything written by tails and saved still gets encrypted. A security issue like this within tails is a possibility but highly unlikely given how well tested it is. 
Anything saved in RAM/processor cache etc as in the intel/amd exploit is wiped when you restard the computer. It could be sent out if there was a connection to the rest of the world while its active, but there is not.

What you think of is a database and they have existed for a long time. If maersk only need a database they can use this. If they need a trustless distributed ledger they need bitcoin.
The reason they put their trust in bitcoin is that other companies that they interact with also can put their trust in bitcoin. They don't want to put their trust in maersk new database because that would give maersk a huge advantage and this advantage might be exploited.

no the point is it costs SOMETHING, so you will guaranteed lose something for a very _very_ small chance of gaining something else. No one is just gonna go "So I have money in this channel and someone is trying to steal it from me, i'll just sit here and do nothing." This is just the absolute last step, before this you gotta DDoS (something ISP will deny you from doing), stop me from changing my IP, stop me from going on my phone, or anywhere else, and stop me from sending a regular text message from my phone.

This exactly. I'd gladly spend 100% of the channelstate in fee just to not give a malicious party anything. And this will happen for the bigger channels, and if they do this they will get in to the blockchain. The attack will not even with all of these really wild imaginary assumptions be successful just cause the largest channels will be empty and a loss for the attacker. The smaller channels that he might get will not outweigh this. 
This + like 5 other glaringly obvious mistakes, thieflar covered it nicely.
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:56:26
Why would you want to open a channel to anyone except a friend or a business? There is an automatic channel opener, but this will not concentrate thousands of connections to a single node, it will do the exact opposite.
It wont work because thousands of people will not at the same point in time have an open channel to a random node that has no use. The "automated malicious bot node" will have to convince people to open bilateral channels with them. Not sure how?
The malicious node has also emptied all his channels, so if some start closing theirs (since they want the bitcoin they own on the blockchain, or whatever reason, it's not a strange thing) the node will lose the funds.
These are all show stoppers.

All of the above could be done in a database, I fail to see the point of having it on a blockchain. Just make the database entries visible for anyone to see.

@_date: 2018-03-14 15:27:34
Not sure. Segwit fee reduction will just mean in some time everyone uses it and people still pay the $ worth that they want to pay for transaction so I dont think this matters. We measure raw $ input not $/WU
In theory if everyone who uses bitcoin today would do most of their transactions on a sidechain or in LN this would mean that blocks would be almost empty. But most likely adoption will grow to keep blocks full, or cheap / free fees will not "push" people to adopt LN. 
And I'd be happy to pay 10x the fee if it means I can then do 100 transactions later through LN, so fee / tx has the potential to go up alot. 
Also I wouldn't pay 10x the fee of today to buy a cup of coffe, so I'd just not use the blockchain at all, whereas with LN I would and that's a new use case that will also increase blockchain use. 
This was kind of a thinking out loud comment, whats your take on it?
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:33:48
Yes, but with absolutely no means of communication ever obviously a world-wide blockchain is not possible. However you can put down a satelite connection anywhere and it will work. For the amount of good it can do it's not very expensive
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:57:03
If I was willing to pay 15k for something and nothing fundamentally changes, I'd not want to sell that same thing for 7k later. 
If I believed it would be more expensive later at 15k, I'd still believe it would be over 15k later since nothing else changed.
If you wanna sell just cause the price went down, you're basing your strategy on past events not future events, to me this seems stupid. You're at a new situation now, 7k=7k you can't go back in time.

So coinbase had a adress with the amount you transfered out + .02686 + fees. When fees were paid and your amount was sent to you there was this amount left 0.02686. In order to not reuse adresses the bitcoin networks sends this left over value to a new adress, still in coinbase wallet.
Similarly if I were to send 1 btc to you, and I have 3 btc in my adress it will look like this:
input Spoekplumpen1: 3btc
output Rjones125: 1btc
output SpoekplumpeN2: 2btc

I'm saying bitcoin because it's the only distributed trustless ledger that there is, in the very least the most stable and secure, you can't bootstrap this with funds since then whoever is paying is a central point of failure.
Ofcourse what you talk about happens every day, and if you are fine with putting your trust in well known stable companies than you can do this, its still not the same thing as bitcoin. Maybe maersk wont need a distributed trustless ledger, most companies dont need this. But if they DO need this, then bitcoin is the choice they have.

I dont really follow your argument, it is theoretically possible to perform this attack, but it's basically impossible to gain anything from it and likely you will lose from it, check out "nothing at stake". 
Also I believe that this theory that "hubs" that are only hubs and nothing more won't be a thing. 
Some nodes will be more well connected, these nodes will be the ones providing something such as a store or an exchange. Coinbase will have thousands of channels so if I want to get well connected instantly I'll open one with them.  And Coinbase gains more being honest than trying this attack that hurts themself in lost funds (since they wont gain anything in the attack), they hurt the bitcoin network wich they depend on for their business and they hurt their reputation. They just won't do it. The incentives aren't there for anyone who could try it.
No one can tell how it will play out, I just really can't understand why someone will just connect to some random place instead of directly to where they wanna transact. I already trust that the webshop I transact with actually sends me the things I bought, there's 0 protection in this. The trust that's needed for my LN channel to this business is alot less since I can punish them and actually gain funds if they try to trick me.
It is however true that you need to be connected (proactive like you say) to defend against the attack. This is something that isn't optimal for LN, but I will keep something on my phone that checks my channels say once an hour. My phone is always connected. These things will get figured out. It's a drawback for LN but I don't see that it will be a problem. 
We live in an exciting time.

Edited some mistakes about when the timelock starts
Sure I understand this, but I dont understand how it's possible given the information I've provided to you.
Let's make it simpler and talk about each of these channels. I'm hubco and you are the malicious actor. Then each of these situations will play out on every other channel.
You transmit your old channel state. Once its in a block I have 1000 blocks to send my newer one. If I succeed I get what's left in the channel (Your part that you yet haven't spent "Nothing at stake fund"). If you succeed you get back everything you've used to buy things.
Now you put this old state in the blockchain and you start spamming the network by closing your channels. The fee to close these channels are preset when I signed the transaction you are broadcasting, say it's 10 sat/byte. You can't change this, since you can't sign it again since you are not me. The transaction is also timelocked for 1000 blocks so you can not CPFP (Child pays for parent). So all your spamming has to be lower than 10sat/byte else your faulty state will never be included either.
So this means you can't spam with the closing transactions, they have preset fee. You have to first transmit them and THEN spam the network. These fees will go to the miner, and I'll gladly outbid you all the way up to 100% of the channel state. So will every other channel. This means you gotta keep lowest fee in each block above 100% of the money you wanna win. That's 2700*1000 transactions with a very high fee. It's pretty obvious that you cant make money this way.
I'm free to increase the fee of my newer state to something that can be included, and I will do so as long as lowest fee in a block &lt; total amount in my channel

Anyone worrying about this here's a good way of doing things.
Get a USB drive, install tails operating system on it, use it in amnesiac mode (it doesn't save anything when you reboot)
Disconnect your computer from the internet before you boot up tails each time. First time generate a wallet and write down the words with pen and paper. Store these in safe locations
Write down an adress to this wallet, test it with a very low amount to see that it's correct.
Now whenever you wanna send money to cold storage, you just send to that adress.
If you wanna send from cold storage, you disconnect your computer, boot tails, login with your word phrases. Sign the transaction and save it on a USB drive, boot up your computer like normal and broadcast it. This way your cold storage never touches the internet.

A sidechain deployed alongside bitcoin will not have any central point of failure, a LN type network ontop of bitcoin for say shipping grain will not require any trust in the network or have any central point of failure. I don't see how you can say that it will? The sidechain wich probably is the more likely solution can have any rules that they want, they can make this suit them in any way, including turing complete scripts etc. The thing that they need is bitcoin base layer so they can punish their counterparty in monetary terms. Then you need a currency under the sidechain so you can resolve the issue of an uncooperative party or just make sure that they will stay cooperative cause its in everyones interest to not lose money. If you never have to worry about someone not cooperating then you have absolutely no need for this technology and a database is alot cheaper and will do the same thing.
A blockchain that isn't a currency first will never be secure AND decentralized. There needs to be incentives that pays the miners to be honest, else miners needs to be controlled in another way and this is a centralization issue. If you want BOTH secure and decentralized, bitcoin is your best bet.

Ethereum is interesting, but it has (IMO) proven that smart contracts shouldn't be handled onchain, since all the micro transactions that we envision being sent back and forth not only in games,financial systems, streaming money, between humans and between machines etc. isn't feasible to be recorded on multiple nodes and broadcasted to everyone etc. It's much more suited to be handled on a second layer between the involved parties and settled on a blockchain as needed (maybe never).
But lets not hijack the thread

True for us.
Someone who can't get a credit/debit card would have an easier time with bitcoin. 
Someone who aren't allowed to open a bank account is way better of with bitcoin. 
Someone who lives in a country that deflates its economy and does not allow to exchange currency is better of with bitcoin.

that was only if there was a problem with centralized hubs, you would open two channels then and serve the network and make some money of it, if you wanted to, else you will open a channel to someone else, that is connected to the rest of the network, and use that channel for as long as you like. 
Opening that channel that I described was a absolute worst case scenario, where only 1 central point was available and it for some reason didn't wanna let you give it fees by using it. That will never happen. Lets say amazon starts accepting bitcoin, you can probably just have a channel with amazon and then be connected to anyone you want. Now replace amazon with any other company that does alot of bitcoin transactions, maybe coinbase, or bitstamp, or whatever, and ur on the LNnetwork connected to everyone else. 
One transaction, unlimited use.

I just fail to see what there is to gain from something that doesn't have to be trustless being stored on a blockchain instead of just stored in a database. There would be a gain to have a common system for handling this, it wouldn't be optimal to have this system ontop of a blockchain.
Ethereum is programmable money so that's why. But ethereum is failing to scale even without having much useage, they may solve it. We will see what happens but I don't see a reason to build these applications (that actually require trustlessness) ontop of anything other than bitcoin 2nd layer once this is tested and deployed and easy to use.
So there's 2 situations
No trustlessness no need for blockchain
trustlessness needed? Some kind of blockchain solution, bitcoin is currently the most secure chain. Anything written in ethereum can be ported to the various solutions currently being developed.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:24:16
there isn't just positives with faster block times or block sizes, it comes with problems.
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:16:49
That's fine to think. And for your short term fiat gains you are correct that a better experience with empty blocks would attract more people.
A brand new ship with a strong captain and no passangers will also be easier to convince to stear in a new direction, this is not strange, but it's also not where I want to spend my money. I wanna go to the destination we set out to, unless everyone agrees to go somewhere else since its better. This is a feature imo.
Now there's a multi layered problem to increasing the block size.
1) A hard fork is very difficult to pull off securely on a chain that's actually being used, therefor having a increase that only goes say 2mb is not worth it. first off 2mb will be filled just as quick (Think internet useage, the more bandwidth the more applications will take advantage of this and eventually you stream video where prior you didn't even have images). 
Therefor we should probably go 8mb, 16mb something like this AND couple it with getting rid of technical debt that's been accumulation. The time to do this is not now, therefor we need to be patient. Short term fiat gains might be down, but if you really understand the revolution that is bitcoin you won't worry about this. Bitcoin is not here to make you rich, that is just a side effect of the amazing thing that we get to experience being developed.
2) Having every transaction on chain is stupid to begin with, especially with such fantastic solutions so very close to being done. In just 8 months we have none-technical (albeit very interested) people doing live trades with real bitcoins through lightning. It's not for everyone today, but im confident it will be in time. 
If most people dont want to be in bitcoin today I understand and Im not worried about this. The only reason to be concerned is if you're a speculative investor. That's fine, you can do that, but bitcoin protocol development should never care about your daytrading.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:08:23
Either you have a slow moving,expensive, centralized authority / way of handling things where an entity can protect people. Or you have a  limitless, premissionless, decentralized system.  Bitcoin is the later, but it requires everyone to watch out for themself. This isn't for everybody but the answer is not to put limits on everyone. The people who can't or dont want to take their responsibility CAN chose to trust a 3rd party to do this for them, for a fee most likely. 
The important part is everyone has their own choice what to do. Atleast this is the future I envision for bitcoin.

Hehe yea, it's very susceptible to survivorship bias. 
Bitcoin was (is) always a gamble. But if you gamle with great odds, then its not the same. I believe that when I read about bitcoin and understood the implications I felt like this is going to 0$ or 100k$ (Currently valued at around 30$) and its probably a 10-30% chance of success.. these were great odds and I and many others took the gamble. It's luck sure, but it's more than luck also, if you never take a risk then you will be stuck where you are. Probably safe and doing OK but never excellent. 
And anyone could have done this if they were informed enough (This ofcourse requires some things such as internet, bank account or a computer to mine with, so some selection is there) but the transformation of wealth in bitcoin goes TO the younger generation, to the semi-poor, to the more well informed. It must be a great thing.

Where I'm from you also have to pay tax on the capital gains when you use bitcoin to buy something.

Well, a developer of LN is not responsible of a blocksize increase like you wanted to make it sound. It's called consensus and a blocksize increase did not gain it even though much effort was put in promoting it. 
Fees atm are not high, and 2mb blocks would not do much to help even if they were. 
And latency? I'm not sure what you mean with high latency. If you mean block propagation that would take alot longer with increased blocksize. Transaction propagation would be the same.
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:43:49
Good explanation of what you mean and an interesting way of thinking. 
I may have to think about this some more however I still believe you are very able to improve above 10% if you have the grit to do so. Ofcourse we only talk monetary means here but having a salary of say 5k and rent/bills + food is 3k you have 2k disposable income, then increasing your salary to 6k gives you 3k disposable income wich is +50%. So if two neighbours at 690 and one gets 50% extra disposable income I'd likely put him higher than 700 (Still only considering monetary terms). And in my example of myself with these imaginary numbers I went from 5k to 10k = disposable income from 2k to 7k wich is 350% extra. But I see your point but its all speculative from there. But like I said I've done nothing special at all, someone with alot more grit, talent and dedication and a great idea can acomplish alot more.
But being bitcoin-rich wich was this thread has nothing to do with any of this at all :)

The Point is, a centralized LN-hub has absolutely no Power other then to relay your transaction for a price, if that price is deemed too high or they refuse to do this, the barrier to opening your own channel is Close to none, and others can then route through you instead, or someone else puts it up and you can route through them.

I'm well aware, not what you mean about latency though. Latency is only talked about as block propagation for miners, or transaction propagation for 0 conf purchases. None of these would get better with bigger blocks, they would get worse. 
Either way you completely did anything you could to avoid any point I was making. I know the fees were high, they aren't now, even if they were 2mb blocks isn't the solution. We can disagree on this but in any scenario you can't go around blaming lightning developers for it, or any other developer. There were bips suggesting increases, they just aren't supported.

@_date: 2017-10-20 19:43:09
faster blocktimes means more collisions in mining blocks and a greater potential for doublespending. Also the chain grows faster so it's a bigger sync and strain on hardware wich results in more node centralization (If the chain is used to capacity, wich ltc isn't).
My point is, LTC does not solve any of the problems that BTC needs to solve.

I mean sure, my point is simply rising the blocksize limit (or time between blocks) isn't a technical solution that bitcoin doesn't also have, therefore litecoin doesn't offer a solution that bitcoin doesn't also have available.
However if it was this easy it would have been done, it's not like the thought of bigger blocks is something advanced that people haven't thought of.
The block size will go up, there's no question about it, no one oposes it. A hard fork should be used to clear up technical debt aswell though, not just bandaid the throughput, block size increase will never suffice to make bitcoin handle enough transactions anyways.
I'm sad to say, but bitcoin is not ready yet, alot of development needs to happen for it to be used by everyone all the time. But lets not rush it. 
The blockchain at the moment is probably very close to behaving like the internet capacity has done, in that the more the capacity is increased, the more it will be used. Kind of like websites did not have images only text in the beginning, and each increase in average internet speed has given us more use, now we are streaming 1080p, so the capacity is always filled up. 
But this scarcity of space fuels development and forces developers to come up with smart ideas how to increase throughput, at no cost for the network, this is a good thing in the long run.
Smart, steady and secure should be the mantra of bitcoin development in my opinion. You are ofcourse free to disagree.

If you don't have internet or mobilephone access directly and there isn't even a connection of any sort anywhere close by, then you are correct that its difficult to transact on a blockchain. If you occasionally have access to the internet a LN-type system can work. Most regions do have occasional access, and there's alot of work on it with drones, airplanes etc, but just bringing it to probably 90% of the world population as a first step should be good enough to start with

What other project is doing something mind-blowing to you?
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:46:21
yea, it's because they probably don't have the knowledge to find out the lowest fee, or that their software chooses the fee (poorly) for them. 
I also know that for example when I was splitting btc and bch I really wanted it to be confirmed quickly since I didnt wanna sit around waiting or exposing myself for too long, so I chose to overpay. 
Also to answer ur first question better, the miners only incentinve is profit. Introducing risk by adding transactions would look something like this: if the blockreward is worth more then (blockreward+fees)*(1-chance someone finds the same block before you're done including transactions).. so if you think there's a 1% chance someone will find the same block in the time it takes to include the transactions the equation for the "break even points "would look like this
12.5BTC = (12.5+fees)*(1-0.01), wich would mean: fees = 12.5/0.99 - 12.5 = 0.126btc. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:51:46
Well you specifically said nodes, you keep saying one thing and responding to another. It's also recently been proven that miners dont decide consensus. If bitcoin as a currency works, then anything built upon it will work. 
Either way that's not my point.
I'm gonna simplify this down a bit to get my point across since you keep throwing out statements.
If one entity, say a company, has control over a blockchain then there is no need to use a blockchain to track things. A blockchain does not solve any issue other than trustlessness. You might aswell have a database with a login where you enter this data, it does exactly the same thing. You can still make contracts to keep these agreements like you propose. 
Just saying the word blockchain does not instantly solve a problem, you have to realize what it is and what its for. The things you talk about here that dont require trustlessness is NOT suited for a blockchain at all.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:07:48
What you say is correct, exept the point that " (PRIVATE) blockchain thats cheaper, more reliable and more trustworthy then current systems."
What type of security model do you envision a private blockchain to have? If it's POW then this chain will be incredibly expensive to operate, or incredibly insecure. POS doesn't really work (yet) and would still be very expensive.  Maybe you think of something else.
I'm not saying bitcoin is the only real case, _if you require trustlessness_ bitcoin is your best bet. 
If you dont require trustlessness, then a blockchain solution is _inneficient_ and I can't think of any scenario where it's prefered over say a cloudbased database. Feel free to provide an example.

UTXO stands for unspent transactions, but the word is a bit tricky I suppose. It's just balance that you haven't spent yet, all bitcoins everywhere are in UTXOs
A transaction takes a UTXO (an unspent balance, balance on a adress) and transfers it into a new adress, where it again is a UTXO and the cycle repeats.

It's not currency like we know it. It's a very liquid commodity I suppose. The end result is the same for me when I use some coins i've mined to purchase something. A dollar was never involved and I bought something.

It's what I've been doing. But my sells are put alot closer. Last run up I did 5% sellof each 5k, I then split the total down to even lower values so I do many smaller sells. This way you will always sell something very close to the top.
I also try my best to use rolling stoplosses. So if it hits say 15k I put a rolling stop that trails the price by 1k, so if it instantly dives to 14k it sells there instead, but if it keeps going up to say 17k before turning down, it will sell at 17-1k = 16k and I made even more profit. And since the system only enables funds to be sold at a new ATH the trend is up so the chance of it going up is larger than it going down. But volatility is a thing ofcourse. 
Either way, just a sidenote. Any plan is better than no plan, that's my motto.

Price fluctuations is unrelated when discussing the posibilities of the technology. A third party could hedge the dollar to bitcoin price for instance and guarantee you your purchasing power. 
A bank is a company, it makes money of you somehow. I assume you have your mortgage with the bank, how much do you think they make of this? If you don't have a mortage they assume that at some point you will and then they want you as a customer. You get 1% interest on your balance, how much do you think the bank makes reinvesting these money? It's also not risk free for us as customers and that's where you pay, it's just that we have no other option yet. 
But yes, you are correct in that bitcoin isn't invented for priviliged people like you and me. We don't need it, I just believe that in time it will be better even for us.
You also ignored my main point enterely, that all these services could be built ontop of bitcoin.

Transfering the funds (and keeping them there longterm) to Nexo sounds like a bad idea. But I have no experience with them, just generally against keeping coins in centralized places.
@_date: 2018-07-29 17:29:32
It's gonna be really difficult and weird to hold everything forever after a certain point.
Why not set certain limits, like each 50k, or every time it doubles you sell a certain percentage of what's left. That way you always have a sell target to look for but you will never run out of bitcoins either. You can calculate this so your remaining btc value always goes up even that you sell off.
@_date: 2018-07-28 22:23:51
All your btc balance could be on your side in a 2by2 channel where you own their key and are free to publish(withdraw it) at any point (Like LN)
So incase of a hack all they can do is publish the latest key and you recieve your bitcoins into your wallet. (Them trying to cheat (with old state) would only benefit you by broadcasting a newer state)

@_date: 2018-07-17 11:48:36
Hi ofcourse, I'll answer to the best of my ability. This actually forced me to learn how the whole things work so a great thanks for that. 
There's two different things. Finding a route, and using a route. While finding a route, each try takes a few seconds and that's what I was referencing. You basically ask everyone you are connected to if they know B, if no one does, then they in turn ask if any of their peers know B and it continues until someone knows B. Actually using a route works differently, and only once a possible route has been established.
Here's what I learned about the using a route (sending) part, this also answers your third question. 
B creates a invoice that A scans, within this invoice there's a "secret" usually referenced R, but it's hashed so A cant actually use it, he can only check if someone else has the answer. A asks all his peers if they know B and it turns out N1 does know B, sweet now we can start transacting.
A signs a transaction with two possible outcomes that he hands over to B, 1a and 1b. (I will not include fees cause that overcomplicates things. Just remember that each transaction is about a satoshi lower down the line, that's where the fee comes from.)
1a sends 1btc to N1 if N1 can supply R
1b sends 1btc back to A after a timelock period
Two other transcations are signed between N1 and B wich states
2a sends 1btc to B if B can supply R
2b sends 1btc back to N1 after a timelock period
Now since B does know the secret R, he can unlock transaction 2a and he has a valid transaction that gives him 1btc. By looking at this transaction N1 can find out what R is, and he also now has access to R so he can in turn unlock 1a and also recieve 1btc. 
Question 2 about depleted funds. There is a mechanism called "nothing at stake" wich is a setting in your software. Basically if you and me have a channel open we both agree when opening that we need to keep (example) 10% of the funds left in each side to make a tranaction. So if my side starts with 1btc, and I spend 0.9 then I cannot spend the last 0.1, they are kept as "ransom". This way I always have some stake and I can't make a fraudulent attack without risking it.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:00:21

I did get it backwards like you say (I was quoting from memory), but only what low vs high sentiment means. Right now it's low sentiment so you should be doing well like I stated, atlesat that's my understanding. 
Yes you are correct, bitcoin is a new thing and we can't compare it straight of to the stockmarket or asset trades but likely we can learn something from it. Good luck with your trading.

Ok, I suppose it's not easy to understand if you do everything you can not to. I never saw anyone write that bitcoin was a safe investment. The constant advice was, it's not a sure thing, dont invest more than you are willing to lose, etc. Now you come in and believe that you were the only one who understood this.
This is my 4th major crash, I'll keep bagholding I'm not worried. I have a sell-off plan and I stick to it. What lottery tickets will you invest in? I mean that was your argument, that atleast there you know your odds, right? Hey you know what, I'll sell you lottery tickets for bitcoin. I'll sell you 10k tickets, you set the price and what percentage chance you want to win. Must be an awesome deal  for you right?

he's likely gonna send huge amounts and it's gonna fail each time, like everyone knows it will since there aren't any other channels as big.
This however won't convince anyone, and if someone doesn't believe in bitcoin or lightning then honestly it does not matter. The only thing the herds of new untechnical people do is drive up the price, wich is nice if you own bitcoin, but bitcoins success does not depend on it. Longterm the better tech will win, what happens inbetween is irrelevant imo.

There's no such thing as a "UTXO transaction". A UTXO is just an adress with more than 1 satoshi in it. Each adress with funds in it is a UTXO, you probably just didn't hear the word before. All transactions made in bitcoin come from a UTXO and arrives in a new UTXO.

All of a sudden we are talking about that the fees for LN will be 1-3% and not an attack vector? Mkay.. 
Creditcards are a pull service with a 2 week settlement period. The processor asks a bank if he can get the money, the bank sends it. During these 2 weeks the bank can stop the transfer, for whatever reason. 
Bitcoin is a push system, where once it's pushed there is no going back. There can be no fraud in this system. 
Stores also accept cash, that doesn't make them a payment processor. Bitcoin is similar to cash. Security measures are needed, but they can use a 3rd party for this, just like you do with the company that comes to pick up the dollar bills. Just send your coins from your hotwallet to their coldwallet automatically or whatever. 
In either case you NEVER open a channel to this malicious bot node that you were concerned about to begin with.
Let's also think about one of my first points that you overlooked. If you try to trick me out of our LN channel balance, I'll gladly spend all of them to make sure you get none. This means potentially 100% of balance into transaction fee. Standard timeout is 1000 blocks, the highest average transactions / block according to blockchain.info is 2723 in december last year. this is 1000*2700 = 2700000 (more with more segwit) chances to get in from the point of the attack. So you need more than 2.7 million channels connected to you. Every channel that has some stake in it WILL get out during this time, meaning the attacker will lose all big channels, and may keep some very small ones. 
The blockchain will be full during this time and it's not a good thing at all. But it's an inconvenience that will pass and bitpay (or whatever paymentprocessor just turned malicious as in your example) will lose not gain anything from this attack, they will lose ALOT. Plus they will not be trusted ever again after so they also just ruined their business.

@_date: 2018-02-21 17:02:07
I dont know, all I did was respond to someone saying that companies would build their own blockchain to handle things. IMO there is 2 situations 
either you want the option to not trust anyone else, then blockchain tech might be for you. 
Or you are fine with trusting some entity to handle the information, then a database type solution is what you are after. 
There's never a situation where a blockchain solution is prefered if you're still gonna have to trust the company running it. 
Conclusion: Private "base-blockchains" won't be a thing, thats the point the OP did in his post that I tried to explain to the other person. Things built ontop of bitcoin may however have many viable applications by keeping incentive through monetary means and taking advantage of the security of the bitcoin network. (Or some other blockchain ofcourse, I just believe the most secure will be the most preferred.)

If you think they do this for you for free you are likely very mistaken. Not that there's anything wrong in charging for what they do, helping you make transactions. 
But if you want this 3rd party to help you with your transactions or someone to talk to if you make a mistake etc, there's nothing that says this cant be built on bitcoin. Where you can opt in to have these feautures that you are correct that many people do want, and pay for it accordingly. 
The nice thing is that you don't have to, and anyone can build it so there will be alot of competition in a free market where those who do it cheaper and takes care of their customers will be successful and others will not. 
Point about price drop in last 6 months is unrelated to the topic.
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:05:19
Do you mean way too low?
In this block there was 0,0775BTC of fees, wich is about 345$, if there was no block reward and the hashrate was the same, it would ofcourse not be profitable to mine anymore. I'm not sure if this is what you mean?
To solve this and keep the same security of the chain (hashrate) people either have to pay more to get a spot in the chain, or the blocks needs to be bigger so more transactions can fit. But this isn't now, since we still have the block reward.
I just read your comment again, do you mean "high enough to include it in a block", well I'm not sure about how to calculate that but it's obviously very quick to add a transaction, but during this time they take the risk of someone else finding the same block. But it seems most miners include most transactions with atleast a fee.

@_date: 2018-07-22 18:10:42
So LN nodes does not matter. The LN node just keeps track of the balances and most recent transactions and looks so no one cheats and presents this information to the user. The funds are locked in 2by2 regular bitcoin transaction where your counterpary already posseses several of your signatures (one for each update on the channel). And these channels would be moved to the new fork also, with the same signatures being valid etc.
LN channels don't currently auto timeout so the funds will be in the 2by2 adress until someone moves them.

I don't know about the 95% thing I haven't heard it myself but those type of numbers are likely always made up. 
The article states though that by taking on bigger risk, both in where you trade (comparison is likely more TA people get into altcoins or ICO like you write, instead of HODLING bitcoin), spending more on fees while trading etc they underperform. 
The conclusion of the article is that the average of people that spend time on TA to try to beat the (regular)market actually does not, for a variety of reasons. Despite taking more risk (wich needs to yield higher return to be justified in a risk/reward calculation), spending more time AND likely being the people who actually knows more about the situation than the person who just buys and forgets but they still underperform. 
Maybe the 95% underperform comes from the fact that 95% of _technical indicators_ when backtested on the stockmarket underperformed. But that doesn't mean that 95% of TA-people use those indicators. It could be 0% and it could be 100%
Further more this study below states that TA works when sentiment is low (like it is in bitcoin right now), and volatility is high (like it always is in bitcoin compared to other assets/stocks)
But this study imo has the problem that ofcourse when the market crashes it's better to have been involved in TA, even if it's just 10% chance you were out of the market when it crashes then TA will on average be better of during the downwards spiral. It's susepticle to survivorship bias. The more interesting point is if it's possible to know before it crashes, and before it starts going up again. 
Since if you were out of the market during the 10 best performing days each year since 2011 you would have a -25% return according 
Basically if you're wrong on TA the 10 best days of 2017 you would lose out on about 1136% gain, and that is what worries me more. If bitcoin takes of then you don't want to be left standing on the sideline. It's the increased risk you take from TA that isn't immediately visible until you're looking back at it. 
I do hope your trading turns out well, but it is not for everyone and I'm certain that on average the people in bitcoin who HODL are better of than those who trade, with a few exceptions.

Price fluctuations depend on risk/reward and are imo useless to consider when we talk about what the fees are. It's a separate topic like I said. You are just throwing that out there to appear more correct in your arguments but in reality you are just trying to confuse things. 
You state that you don't pay anything to use bank transfers, and it works exactly like you dont pay anything to use your creditcard. But you do, the fees are just somewhere else but you are still the one paying them in the end. You are just wrong on this. Banks aren't charities that help you transfer money out of good will like you seem to believe, they are a for profit company, nothing wrong with this at all but you should realize it. 
And even if banks are cheaper bitcoin has many properties that that are superior. The two aren't completely comparable. 
There's some verifiable facts for you.

It's true, routing is an issue but I personally don't envision multihopping 6-7 steps will be common or needed.
In a research paper about twitter it showed that the most common separation between anyone on twitter is just 4 steps and nearly everyone is 5 steps inbetween. 
Now twitter friendships is ofcourse free and seemless to create, so everyone will have alot of friends and not so many LN channels. However the number of stores you are interested in are more limited than any random twitter user and will also be more well connected to eachother. 
Example you are really into stamp collecting. You're visiting a stamp shop to buy some rarities sometimes so you have a connection there. Now you find a new shop that sells stamps. The chance of you being 3 steps away from this new shop is alot larger than being 3 steps from a death-metal poster shop that you have no interest in. 
It will likely look something like this (You) - (Stampshop1) - (Another collector) - (Stampshop2)
This is ofcourse only theories and we'll have to see how it develops. In the meantime, payment channels already solves the issue of instant trustless payments.

I actually looked at the block explorer just as I wrote the last comment and there had been 5 blocks within 4 minutes. Height 518928 to 518932.
The time until the next block arrives IS RANDOM. that isn't oversimplified or misleading.

Clarification. It listed BTC as BTC, and BCH as Bitcoin BCH
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:51:37
No not at all.
You lock your bitcoins in a channel with a counterparty. If you make a transaction you give him a new signed channelstate where he owns some of your bitcoins so if he chose to transmit this new channel state some of your bitcoins end up in his adress and the rest goes back to your adress. If he doesn't transmit it then you can update the state again as many times as you like. Bitcoins never leaves the blockchain and there is no token,ever.
Check some tutorials
I checked your post history. Holy crap you've argued with like 10ppl that there's a LN-token. How can you be so sure about something that's so easy to find out that it isn't so?
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:12:26
This has nothing to do with how bitcoin works though. 
The trustless part of bitcoin is that anyone can see how it works, the permissionless part is no one can stop me from sending my coins to someone else in return for goods. 
These two things are what makes bitcoin special, if you wanna speculate in the valuation of a bitcoin that's fine, but bitcoin doesn't care if you get rich or poor it works either way, and it's still amazing.

There's a concept called "nothing at stake" wich I think most implementations atm is running with and it's basically that you gotta keep a certain (up to you) percentage of your channel filled.
So if I add 1btc to the channel, my partner might have a rule that I always gotta keep atleast 0,01btc in my end of the channel. So that I cant try to cheat "for free" but I will risk that 0,01

Good find.
I read that like the values are always rounded down like you say, but is that for the person that closes the channel that stands to lose then, and the partner only stands to gain (1 satoshi). Would be reasonable. Or does it go into fee? It has to go somewhere atleast :)

Yes, and this has already been stated by InfoFront to you in this very thread. 
You compared it to a computer company (IBM) or a company managing phone networks/making phones (Nokia) where it isn't either of these things. Bitcoin is the technology of computers, or bitcoin is the network that nokia makes hardware to. 
There were several competing technologies in both these spaces, or as you already got explained to you, in the internet itself. In the end one came out on top and became the reference. 
No one said bitcoin would guaranteed be the successor, that's not even the subject of the thread, you seem to just throw a hissyfit at anything mentioning bitcoin since you believe in some other altcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:26:26
You get the fees, and each fee can be alot higher if everyone can use each transaction many more times as per my exacmple. That's why there needs to be limited blockspace. If there is always space in the blockchain then every transaction will be very cheap. 
Currently there isn't pressure on the blockchain so it's very cheap to transact. But we saw in december that people were willing to pay alot to use the network. Now we don't necessarily wanna go back to those fees for a single transaction. But if LN means I just need to transact on the blockchain once per month and afterwards can use that for 100s of transactions then higher fees are very reasonable to pay.
Last block ( had 0.15 btc in fees, 0.15x100 would be 15btc wich is more than the current reward and a net equal for someone in the example I gave.

Some confusion comes from the recent release of a android app I believe.
Since you generate a new seed when you open it if you never used that particular wallet before, most people make a transaction first to the "ln network" but just a normal onchain transaction, then they make another to open the channel.
This ofc wont be the case if you already have a wallet that gets integrated with LN (or import an adress)

It's not gonna be a one day its finally done. LN is the network, it's here. Different teams are making implementations of wallets and other software to run ontop of LN and they will come and go. Good teams will succeed and make great things, bad teams will fail. This isn't something that concerns LN in the same way as the internet doesn't fail if your browser has issues. 
If user experience and convenience of LN keeps growing, so will the network because more people will use it. It's all about organic growth from here, not a flag date of software.

After the hardfork people would be able to protect their funds. Unused funds would perhaps (depending on how the hardfork looks) be unlocked and distributed either maliciously or evenly between active acounts.
However my point is even if the price of a bitcoin goes to 100$ bitcoin still works. Bitcoin isn't an investment and it isn't dependent on if the participants get rich or poor. It's a means to deliver value from a to b trustless

No, this is untrue. Miners always choose wich transactions to include they dont have to chose one that is seen first. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:53:10
Because blocks are random. The average is 10min but in any one circumstance it can be 30min, or 3 blocks within 2 minutes. This is not something I feel is productive to spend time to explain, it's very basic you know this if you are in this forum.
"That gives the block a higher chance to confirm" I'm gonna guess you mean the transaction? 
Yes, ofcourse. But miners still choose this, transactions aren't guaranteed to get in because they have higher fee, and most definately not by the time they were broadcasted like you claimed. Both of these claims you made even if true still doesn't make on-chain transactions in a brick&amp;mortar store close to a viable idea.
We are either stuck there waiting for a block or I'll just RBF the transaction the second I walk out and enjoy my free shopping.

I've also messed around some in lightning on mainnet, and it does fail sometimes, especially when you connect far away. 
This however doesn't mean to me that LN is failed, it just means that it isn't there yet. It still works flawlessly (from my experience) if I'm a return customer and connect directly to where I wanna go. (1 onchain transaction for 10 LN trascations etc.) 
@_date: 2018-04-23 07:53:54
Agreed. My point was mostly that the network bitcoin will still work so it will recover. People often focus on the price as a measure of success or failure and I don't like that angle. Bitcoin shouldn't be an investment, people buying this early might get rich but that's a side effect of all the positive things the network can create not the purpose of the network.

I dont even know one thing that makes a LN hub similar to a bank.. Routing money perhaps but that's more like VISA then.
Can you give some examples since you obviously thought about this?
The answer is every "LN hub" (that this will even be a thing is debatable and I believe it wont be) is opt-in with almost 0 friction. If one misbehaves it will almost instantly sease to be a hub because people will stop using it and it has lost all its power, in a heartbeat. There is no lock-in effect, they have no power. At best they can sacrifice everything in order to make a slight inconvenience for a user. Nothing more.
Banks will still exist, they will issue loans and recieve interest, help people with investments etc. Visa / mastercard though might be in for a rough ride

You are correct, about 0-2 blocks / day so about 1/144 chance(alot lower in reality). However if nothing malicious is going on the transaction is most likely included in both competing blocks.
To pull this of maliciously however is extremely unlikely and not profitable given risk/reward. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:30:36
aren't those gonna be the absolute most similar cases though? People will connect to some stores that they normally transact with. And when they wanna go outside their normal stores, chances are very high that someone uses one of their normal store + the new store they wanna transact with. 
It does seem there can be some trouble with 5-10 hops atm, atleast from my (limited) trial of LN so far but I question how common it will be to have to go through 5+ hops if the network matures

You can also see it as someone breaks consensus (This is a hardfork), the chain that still follow the same consensus as before is just the same and who ever branches off is a branch.

We have to be able to also buy a computer, a bike etc.. goods for a few 100$ and if we envision a world where everyone purchases with bitcoin then it's not feasable to have everyone stand around and wait. Just the fee prediction procedure is too complicated to be done on the fly. 
Lets agree that its prefered to be instant and actually trustless

You can't compare "bitcoin cash" to "bitcoin core", one is a network the other is a client.
Bitcoin core is a software that runs on bitcoin, there are others that also run on bitcoin.
The client for bitcoin cash is for instance called "bitcoin abc"
You can have any opinion on what you prefer but this is not debatable.

The good thing is they can choose to have the exchange hold it, or hold it themself. This option isn't available atm. As long as there's a way to opt-out from an centralized institution this forces the institution to behave else it loses its customers. 
The entry to start a site that holds bitcoins for people is next to none. The entry to start a bank is high enough to call impossible. Competition will flourish and normal people will profit from it.

They can ofcourse, but if they are exactly the same then the only difference is that bitcoin is more secure, so outside a novelty usecase I don't see why anyone would.

The idea is that miners decide what transactions to include, so if a miner feels its worth to mine a 1sat/byte transaction he will. Another might not. 
Problem is miners don't only have variable costs like electricity, they also have static cost (purchasing hardware wich has a maximum life span) so they gotta make money from each machine, quickly. Without limited blockspace fees will always be really cheap cause at least 1 miner will sweep up every transaction every time it finds a block. 
Also miner incentive is making money quickly, the network incentive should be to stay healthy forever. I don't see how anyone believes these two will align. It's a bit sad that we likely won't know how big blocks will affect the network since it has so little use and most nodes are cloudhosted. Would have been a great experiement to learn from otherwise.

Agreed that it might not be very impressive, it is very usefull though, especially if adoption pushes up base layer fees in the near future. Also the instant, 0 trust needed confirmation is a very big thing that we can enjoy today.
Lightning network has some way to go like you say, atm there are some issues between different implementations that hasn't been standarised. Also the network is too small to provide liquidity (sometimes) to buy shirts of blockstream. As long as the tech works and improves the network will grow organically to help with this. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:53:31
Because when blocks get full this doesn't work anymore. So unless you will always have free blockspace, forever, for any application that wants to use it then it will not be a good idea. 
Also I've heard Roger state multiple times that 0-conf was the way it was done prior to RBF on bitcoin. When I started bitcoin it was the common praxis to wait 6 confirmations to consider something safe. 
I often hear the argument that 0-conf may be considered safe enough, that a coffe owner probably doesn't care about the added risk of accepting it etc. 
I'm just glad that the developers of the bitcoin protocol doesn't settle for terms like "good enough" "doesn't care about" etc. 
Also I don't see the point when there clearly are better solutions available.

Yea I ment double spend risk.
In answer to the end question, no they don't. However even if a customer do a credit card scam the merchant recieves their money and visa / master card covers the loss. So it's not really applicable here. The merchant doesn't take any risk.
I gather from your comment that you are not talking about bitcoin but another alt-coin? Making a double spend is incredibly easy to pull of, you just RBF it one second after you walk out of the store and you will have pulled it of. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:07:34

I'm also in your boat thoughtwise. But I also agree with fraggle and I do believe that you can get better %-return on your money if you wait to invest. We will be very liquid when other are not (If it gets expensive to borrow money, we still have it but no one can outbid us by borrowing more)
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:32:16
Sure, I understand now. The correct term should be your node.
It may have closed because of a software upgrade on either your PC or your phone. It's nothing inherent in Lightning Network that makes the channel close. A channel will only close if one of the two parties (in this case they are both you) decides it will close. So it will only close if you tell it to
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:42:02
Yes, but in LN first off you can create the channel way ahead of time so that's not an issue.
To close the channel (uncooperatively) you have 2 weeks, so even if 90% of the network is dishonest you will still settle the transaction.
Since you are in this forum I believe that you understand these things. If you don't, then stop arguing with people in this thread and go read up on the tech that you are discussing first. I'm happy to keep discussing with you but you gotta start by trying to learn about it first.

I might misunderstand what you initially wrote.
"Bitcoin cash is a fork of bitcoin and has as much legal right to use the name as bitcoin core."
Here you say that bitcoin cash (a network) has the same right to a name as "bitcoin core" (A software). I'm saying that the two aren't comparable. They are two completely different things. 
But if you already know this then all good but you should compare "Bitcoin ABC" with "Bitcoin Core" (Two softwares), or BTC with BCH (Two networks). I'm just trying to inform.
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:20:47
You can't compare the situation of a orphaned block with a 0conf not being included. One is highly unlikely and almost an impossibility to pull of on purpose even if you have close to 50% of the hashpower. The other is fairly easy to pull of if you have a pool that finds a few blocks per day.
Regardless 6-conf is what I concider safe, it's no issue having a 6 conf LN channel for your spending since you can open it at your convenience ahead of time. You won't ever orphan a 6-conf transaction.

I think its important that you brought up point  actual instant confirmation with 0 trust involved.
LN will go a long way to solve scaling, but with instant, trustless confirmations we opened up huge new opportunities and actually made bitcoin useable for every trasaction

I mostly agree with you, it will be catastrophic for the trust in the network. But we'll have a few years to prepare everyone, likely making this upgrade hardfork well before old adresses starts getting solved.
Also a hardfork doesn't require anyone to do something other than upgrading their software and the software itself could move the funds to a new adress and funds are protected, everyone in this space wants the funds to be protected so everyones incentives are aligned to solve this. 
It's actually worse with the mining wich will be much more of a toxic discussion on what new mining algoritm to choose, I believe.
Luckily we aren't alone facing these problems, any online security is compromised with quantum tech

Saying that it would be 5min like craig does is so incredibly low level understanding of very very basic concepts, but it's still (like always) an order of magnitude more difficult to explain (and prove) why someone is incorrect.

I always believed in bitcoin, but when I had a discussion with people and they asked me "So what's the problems" I always responded that the biggest trouble bitcoin was facing was the randomness of getting into a block, and I couldn't give a good explanation of how it would be solved. Standing around in a shop waiting for confirms obviously isn't viable. 
I'm glad to say I can answer my own question now.

Most likely it will check for available route/channel/balance. In a worst case scenario you automatically throw up a new channel to where you wanna pay and pay through it. This doesn't even have to be visisble for the user just automatic. (Waiting to get into block though but still user friendly)
I had alot of failures a few weeks ago, tried it today and all successfull (5 tries to random places with just one channel open)

Why did you find it useful to post about what you guess the chance is? I'm just honestly curious
32% chance comes from at 80% hashrate there is 50% chance that it will succeed, and since we're lower then that it will become lower. It's pretty basic.
@_date: 2017-07-10 11:37:27
That's confirmed transactions, and if there is a limit of transactions in each block, and they are full, confirmed transactions wouldn't increase. However those transactions had to pay more to get in there because of spam, or that is the theory, what is true I dont know, but confirmed transactions would not provide proof in either direction.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:06:20
Yes. You are currently running code from someone you have no idea who he is (Satoshi). So long as the code is open for review you don't have to care who writes it, just what it does.
This concept seems to be difficult to grasp for some people, since they are used to being told what to do, and they feel comfortable following someone they believe is an authority. These people should probably not deal with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:38:17
