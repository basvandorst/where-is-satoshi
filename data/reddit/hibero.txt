Just note that "destroyed" is relative to Ethereum's own standard. By that same pending transaction standard, Bitcoin has been destroyed for years. Roughly 4x more "destroyed" than Ethereum at the moment

Got this from my sister. It seems to be making wide circulation through facebook.
Personally, I don't follow Dave Ramsey's teachings but I do know there are a lot of people that do. Sadly he doesn't know there is a major difference between foreign and digital currencies.

"Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?"
One of us.
@_date: 2014-09-30 23:53:57
Peershares. I think that may work.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:09:05
He seemed to be mixing a lot of common sense values with a deep misunderstanding of digital currencies. Which to me, is a dangerous thing.
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:13:04
Technically they are both new chains since they have changed rules in the protocol since then. So there is no active "real chain".

Costs lower over time for nearly everything and sorry that you feel that censorship-resistance is only useful for one type of "digital gold."
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:28:15
Lol high costs for certain things but low costs for others. If you understood blockchain, you'd get the nuance :P
High costs are for the actual consensus algorithm. It should be very difficult and costly for a single actor to attack the consensus algorithm.
And yes, costs lower over time. Literally costs have lowered nearly overall for Bitcoin in the last two years (the growth of the Bitcoin Blockchain has been much lower than the growth of the memory). Shit. The whole point of not uping the blocksize is to limit the costs.
So.... Whatcha talking about Willis?

MakerDAO - Decentralized Stablecoins  
Augur - Prediction Markets  
ERC721 (Cryptokitties included) - Collectables and "unique" tokens  
0x - Decentralized Exchanges  
Dharma - Decentralized Loans
I mean, yes most of those have tokens but I also don't know why that would discredit them.
Those projects are not possible currently on Bitcoin. I think that is moving the space forward.
If you're looking for "pure" infrastructure. I think Plasma (the LN creator is working on this one), Sharding, PoS research, Swarm, and Whisper are all interesting topics.
I see a lot of fluff in the space but there is hard evidence that work is happening on Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:13:36
Really? I mean, I understand the hesitation and I understand the hate due to the shittiness of a lot of alts but Ethereum has done much more than that. The only way to get anywhere in this space is to be able to see through the noise and see the actual signal (potential). 
Honestly, for the vast majority of Bitcoin's life, the only thing it was good at was making altcoins. Half of the altcoins out there are made of 98% of Bitcoin's code. Is that the case now? no...
First pages don't make a book and the early years won't make a blockchain. Try to see the vision and see if they are acting on it or not.
I just think it's difficult to say that Ethereum is not pushing the space forward as a whole. I'm not saying Bitcoin is not. I'm saying there can be more than one, this isn't Highlander.
@_date: 2018-06-17 15:53:53
Okay. Tell me why you think running apps on a secure, "inefficient" ledger is stupid. Money is just the app of Bitcoin. It's literally just information when you get down to the basis of it all. 
If the only valuable information in the universe that needs to be secure is money, then I think you are thinking too narrowly.
@_date: 2018-06-17 16:56:32
lol well MakerDAO and 0x are working pretty well.
Aragon and Dharma are in soft launch mode. 
Augur will be fully releasing in less than a month. 
And I understand the hate for ERC721, I feel like they just haven't been properly utilized.
The potential is there and in some ways it's starting to be utilized.
I understand the notion of hating all altcoins, there's a shit ton of them and there's a ton that deserve to be called shitcoins, but I think it's kind of silly to call Ethereum one of those. It's proven itself over the last few years. 
I think the money aspect is interesting but there's more to it. Ethereum's success does not mean Bitcoin's demise. There's plenty of room in this space. They just both have different markets.
@_date: 2018-06-17 15:57:27
I mean, we can start from the easy ones. 
Aragon - Decentralized Governance  
MakerDAO - Decentralized Stablecoins  
Augur - Prediction Markets  
ERC721 (Cryptokitties included) - Collectables and "unique" tokens  
0x - Decentralized Exchanges  
Dharma - Decentralized Loans  
I mean, yeah we're still at the beginning but the infrastructure is being rolled out fast.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:49:09
The thing is, I don't think we need to play a game of chicken. I don't follow the BU stuff so much but I highly doubt anyone respectable  would say there is no value in a second layer but I also doubt there are many who can say there is no value on increasing the "settlement" layer. So, why not just do both?
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:10:56
Doesn't this just seen childish? If both sides can't come to agreement then there should be a Hard Fork. If there is a Hard Fork, then I have little doubt that both sides will be cumulatively weaker than Bitcoin without the Hard Fork. Come on guys, let's come to an agreement.
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:37:11
Fair point. I guess so.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:09:15
Haha no man. I'm not saying that there are no objective "right" or wrong paths. I'm just saying there can and is more than one path depending on the objective. And debating between two of these (possibly "right") paths has been degrading the network. If you haven't been seeing it, look again. It's now hitting the average user.
I'd advise against thinking that the path you like is the only path and the best "objectively right"path. It's not that simple. 
We all know that the market can and will be irrational at times. Only long term trend lines of markets can be trusted. So try not to take short term trends as a measuring stick.
Edit: Also, axioms are what you're calling objective truths. It's best to be pragmatic with them. They can be dangerous. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:11:33
But then why have it connected? If it can apparently serve it's purpose not being connected?
A connection between the network could mean if there's something wrong in the Litecoin network, it can effect Bitcoin. That seems like a dangerous proposition for no apparent benefit.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:37:30
Effectively raising the coincap of Bitcoin and changing the economics of the Bitcoin network for minimal to no benefit.
This will singlehandedly force me to sell my Bitcoin reserve.
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:44:55
"Right" is subjective by itself. Bitcoin seems to be losing is pragmatism.
"No compromise" by no means guarantees the the objectively correct outcome. We need to deal with these problems from a practical position not a ideological one. This is not a religion.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:34:27
Why would anyone want to move testnet coins onto a mainnet? Seems very dubious
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:22:08
Just curious. Why do you think the issues facing Bitcoin now are not systemic issues? I mean, I don't even want to transfer coins between my wallets anymore due to the high fees that have been around.  
The price can go up in the short term but the lack of compromise is very concerning to me. I don't see how we can long term last if we can't even come to an agreement when things are this bad.
In other words, this is becoming to reminiscent of US politics. Can we please get our shit together and compromise.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:52:08
Nodes and miners still have to accept the fork.... so I don't understand your point. The devs in Bitcoin are subject to the same thing.
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:45:42
Please get off the whole, everything is a scam other than Bitcoin horse. It just comes off as toxic and represents why I have such little patience for this subreddit nowadays.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:28:58
Complexity? You can go ahead and say 10000 Satoshis and I will say say 100 uBTC.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:50:30
Agreed. I'm not sure what is with this FUD. Anybody can suggest what the fees should be but yeah.... miners set it. Idk where the myth came from that Vitalik magically sets it. Like he's the God of Ethereum or something. Cmon guys. Let's be rational.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:22:50
i thought this was a new type of currency? Doesn't that mean that your currency rules don't matter.
I guess we will see what people will use over the years since we don't make the rules.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:02:06
People might as well frame this picture and keep it by their computer. Maybe it will help with their sanity.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:00:46
You know those are SI units and millions if not billions of people say micro-units every day. I know your fighting for the Satoshi thing and I have nothing against that but don't lie about the usage of SI units.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:53:04
To be fair, I can see how a governing body can view something this unique, with this volatility, and borderless anything but a commodity right now.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:56:47
They have to write something and bad publicity is publicity. I see this article as a good not bad. At the end they do quote that it may hold long term promise.  There is nothing wrong with criticism.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:14:32
At a bitcoin price of $10,000, $1 would be 100 uBTC. I think micro- would be good for some time.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:49:08
One step closer in adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:05:07
Same. I would just let them log into your account. They will be selling coins again on Friday so you might want to to bypass the waiting period.

So is the author saying he knows all three? He's not full of himself at all.

If this is the first payroll software, then this is awesome.
If this is not the first payroll software, then this is awesome.
Adoption of bitcoin is just awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:03:45
Yep. Micro is the way to go right now. We can worry about satoshis when it actually goes mainstream and the price is right.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:42:31
I think we should just move over to mBTC and uBTC. Satoshis may be too far.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:21:12
Penetrate? Huh? Yeah they penetrated a bunch of computers, not the algorithm.
Bitch be crazy. Haha
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:50:35
Go look at some orderbooks. They should have them on chart sites.
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:43:29
From my understanding, no. There was pretty much no pre-mine. He only mined the genesis block and two to confirm it. Now if you mean that 150 LTC is a ton. Then I guess you would be right. 
Here is the original announcement.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:13:11
It was world stock market cap. The other one would probably be much much larger than that if it exists.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:47:46
Agreed, truecrypt. I wonder if it is possible to just rename it as a textfile and hide it in some schoolwork materials.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:37:15
I know some hardcore Bitcoiners will hate me for this but you can still mine litecoin or any other scrypt coin with a GPU. GPU mining is not worth it with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:41:11
Profitability in mining bitcoin is always a speculative thing. At this rate? Most likely you will make ROI. It's better to just buy though. More bitcoin for your buck.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:07:08
Cold storage, is the way to go, I guess.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:57:44
Could you use market cap? The World Market Cap is estimated at $57.5 trillion.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:15:42
I a pretty sure transfers only go out on business days but I may be wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:26:47
Sorry OP. ^this guy is right. if you would like you can still use that GPU on other coins such as litecoin.
Mining can slow your computer down if your monitor or programs use your discrete GPU. I can personally do most things while the miner is running due to having a integrated GPU.
Energy depends on your card. Mine take 175W.
From my understanding there has not been any problem with SteamBits.com
