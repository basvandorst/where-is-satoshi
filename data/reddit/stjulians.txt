He might have struck a deal with the big content firms making the service legal.
Whether you like him or not, it is hard to doubt or deny that he has been successful. In which case, he probably has a solution. Winners tend to keep winning. It would be very funny to me if after all the arguments about big vs small blocks that he could steam in from left field with a solution that syphons a few satoshi's from each transaction into his business. He'd become super rich and deserve it for solving such a problem.

If your friend thinks that his BTC is now worth only $12, you should offer to buy him out at $24 or $36, to help him recoup some of his loss.

Sure I know about his career. All I was saying really was that we all knew someone that grew up to work on the wrong side of the law. Most of them do not live in massive mansions or had the kinds of success that he has had. Being a career criminal, as you say, is still a career and some are much better at it than others. 
Or, he might be legitimately solving a problem and about to become very, very wealthy. Who knows...?

Thanks. I think I understand. That was helpful.
I think my question about reputation still remains though ... why does the media seem to think this would be a problem for BTC but always overlook the fact that most other systems would be compromised as well? They just don't understand? Media bias? Something else?

Question 11 interests me:
"Will quantum computing eventually break Bitcoin’s ingenious solution to the double-spend problem, or will Bitcoin keep one step ahead?"
My understanding is that whilst yes, quantum could one day break bitcoin, if it is possible, it will also open up every bank and insurance company security system too. If that is the case, then the entire financial system would be in a state of collapse. My question then, is why do people always regard this as a weakness for BTC when it is actually a weakness for every computer, every bank, every transaction, every credit card etc etc?
Thanks for your thoughts!

I opened a Coinbase account about three weeks ago and I have to say that it was a nightmare. I'm fairly techie, but still it was damn difficult. I think I uploaded 10 versions of my photo, then you get the 40 per day maximum limit. Its a joke. I told them so as well. While I'm sure their customer service people are all lovely people, their answers were not helpful, their knowledgebase seems to be out of date and questions go unanswered and they don't have a telephone number that anyone answers. Other than that, the experience was adequate.

Expansion might be a better word.

Now its buy $100 and both the refer and the buyer get $10 for free.

Since he was first, we can also assume that if he wanted to be early in other cryptos he would have been. So it is reasonable to think that the real Satoshi also has a stack of Litecoin, Dash, Ripple, etc. He could probably sell a few of those instead and keep us all guessing and wondering...

I'm convinced that Coinbase will be more secure than I can manage on my own. Not being a tech / cryptography expert, I would imagine the weakness in any system I use would be me.

I saw some posts recently about "bear whales" closing big positions. I don't know enough about how BTC trades, but I understand some other markets very well and those positions could have accounted for the fairly narrow trading band that has been in place in recent weeks. With them removed, plus the additional impetus of the coming halving, plus the devaluation underway in China, that might have caused the imbalance between buyers and sellers.

"German Finance Minister Schaeuble said in April that the ECB's record low interest rates were causing "extraordinary problems" for German banks and pensioners and risked fuelling the rise of euroscepticism in Germany, where voters had flocked to the right-wing Alternative for Germany in state elections." 
This is very ironic considering the vice-like grip that he has over ECB and eurozone policy!

I would have thought that the idea of all electricity worldwide going down is a little unlikely, no? There are many countries that use nuclear power and that would still continue to function no matter what happened to the currency, because you can't just switch nuclear power stations off, at least not without creating a disaster. Plus, from what I have seen, some of the nothern mining operations in places like Iceland mostly use geothermal power. That also won't stop just because paper currency is in trouble.

Until last week I was sharing an office with a Venezuelan developer. He has moved to Europe within the last 6 months. 
It seems that there is a lot of potential for BTC there. Because of the economic crisis, most businesses have closed, so there are empty buildings and warehouses in every town and city. Because of Chavez's economic policies, electricity is virtually free. 
My former colleague has one mining rig hosted in a warehouse by a friend. That friend has more than 300 rigs in the same building. If you have empty buildings, virtually free electricity and rampant inflation, what else are you going to do...?
My former colleague thinks that this might be one of the reasons why they are having such power shortages, because the local hash rate is rising so fast. I don't know how true that might be, but you never know.

They would probably follow the FATF list of blacklisted countries. This would likely mean that it would be countries like Iran, Yemen, North Korea, Syria, Afghanistan and a handful of others. Some of those barely have electricity, so crypto currency transactions probably aren't a big deal.

Why would they do that in America? I don't understand. If you wanted to be "free" wouldn't you find another country to do it in?

As a former journalist, but not BTC expert, the BBC and Economist would have wanted some time to research and write their stories, so they will have agreed on a set date and time to publish between themselves and him. In which case, moving a coin or signing the genesis block in front of their eyes but before the press reveal would have caused a similar amount of speculation and mayhem in places like this sub.

100,000 male devs. Every third building housing a new start-up. Sounds great, apart from the no women part.

They can, but the process takes many months, not hours. Decommissioning a nuclear power station takes years. If the system crashed, as was suggested in the original post, would there be a global energy blackout as mentioned above? Probably not, no, because the nuclear power stations would still be running. Hence, there would be electricity somewhere for bitcoin to run.

I have a small amount that I have been buying each month, in Coinbase. My next step, I think, is to start moving to Trezor. From their website I cannot tell the answer to this, but is it possible to have wallets from other alt coins on a trezor as well? Or does it only work for one BTC wallet? Thanks.
