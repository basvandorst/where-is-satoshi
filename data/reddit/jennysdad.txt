there is no reason for bitcoin to rise.  The only value in bitcoin is the blockchain and anyone can use it.
Bitcoin will be drowned out in a sea of other blockchain coins.

you mean how is it working for me if I bought $10,000 worth of bitcoin last December?

you only need security for the transaction, something any crypto-coin can do.
You are at least acknowledging that the value in Bitcoin is the value of the brand.  So the real threat is someone with better branding coming along.

I can use any crypto-coin to do this.  Nothing makes bitcoin special beyond it's current market share.  It's like Diners Club Card, in the beginning it was first and the biggest.  When was the last time you saw someones use a Diners Club Card?

but the sidechains means that the bitcoins themselves wont be as important because they won't be required to complete a trade, only later to settle up between sidechain vendors, right?

edit: the reply below was meant for the poster who posted 
I mixed it up.
 at the 6 minute mark he starts to explain how Bitcoin is NOT a currency, but maybe one day can be developed into one  - once some new innovations are invented (6:35 mark).
Bitcoin it not a currency and claiming that it is is fraud.

no, I believe that guy is everything you say he is, and a publisher of multiple books on bitcoin.  
It still doesn't make bitcoin a currency.
edit: the transaction fee for using bitcoin  makes using bitcoin too expensive.

you do not need a bitcoin to have 'value', you need it to conduct a transaction.   That transaction can be completed with a $0.01 value coin or a $10,000 value coin.

I did not come to bitcoin sub, this post came to /all
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:16:37
I am curious, how do you interpret this post: 
@_date: 2018-06-11 04:26:12
I just saw a thread in /all and I click on stuff without considering what sub-reddit it is from.  Bitcoin enthusiasts share many traits with MLM enthusiasts.  If it works for you fine, but BITCOIN IS NOT A CURRENCY.  Smeggletoot just linked a video where the so called expert explains how it isn't a currency - start at the 6 minute mark and linsten to the speaker predict how bitcoin will one day *become* a currency , but he compares it to visa transactions (a payment facilitation service, not a currency) and how the costs will trend to zero (the transaction costs).   At  6:34 he admits to you that these proposed solutions "maybe don't even exist yet".  How's that for disclosure.
Bitcoin right now is a transaction system.  It is not a currency.

'boring' is making billions in a financial sector?
'exciting' is trusting others.  This guy is selling MLM.
cryptocoins are not [currency]( they are a means of completing transactions. There is almost no barrier to entry for bitcoin copies.

the internet and bitcoin are not comparable - trying to draw a false equivalence only goes to further my belief that Bitcoin is at it's core a confidence game.
@_date: 2018-06-11 04:59:52
what stops alternatives to bitcoin from doing all of those same things, but perhaps even better?  the only thing that gives bitcoin an edge is it's the current "it girl".  Once bitcoin does become a currency there will be copycat currencies - you won't be able to stop it.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:50:44
what do you mean the internet has no brand?!?  Access portals, search engines, etc... the internet is almost NOTHING BUT branding.
a resource based economy?  what about services?
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:31:25


it IS all about money.  It is also all about branding.
I'm not sure why it isn't classified as a MLM scheme.
@_date: 2018-06-11 04:06:59
how do you account for the transaction fee problem? 
bitcoin/blockcoin transaction have their uses, but it is not a currency.
edit: I keep saying bitcoin because I mean this particular currency.   If the blockchain technology is eventually morphed into a currency it'll be something new.
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:31:49
noone has yet to give me a reason why bitcoin will go up in value.
