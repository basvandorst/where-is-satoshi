I moved some coin from a cold wallet and decided to tick dynamic fees (electrum).  My calculations to zero it were based on what it was showing at the time but the transaction left about 3000 satoshis or so.  
So I sent more and used static fees when I pulled it out but the same amount remains.  
I don't go round throwing away small denomination coins so I don't really wanna throw this wallet until I clear it.  Any ideas what I did or didn't do wrong when I tried to fix this?

Their reasons for asking for alternatives were and are self-serving.  The preservation of centralised and outdated business models which were needed at first to introduce less technical people to bitcoin.  They want to scale those outdated business models rather than adapt to a less centralised one.  It’s no problem though.  They’ll adapt or be replaced.

The roots are rotten so the tree and all its fruit is rotten.  It’s just that there’s so much bad money to fund it’s growth.

The former two are photographed buddying up with a guy on Homeland Security’s top ten most wanted list for illegal gambling and money laundering.
These guys are rotten to the core.  Their supporters are driven by greed and they suck in the ignorant but ignorance is easily overcome spending five minutes with google.

I don’t believe the computing requirements for miners mining big blocks and nodes verifying big blocks, big enough blocks to allow global popularity, will keep pace or currently exist.
I don’t think Satoshi anticipated the rapidity of growth.  He certainly didn’t anticipate asics or the ability to short circuit the proof of work.  
Nodes at the beginning were all miners.  The client nodes he refers to have been necessary for contributing participants for a long time now because profitable mining grew out of reach of newcomers long ago.  Without diverse and geographically widespread client nodes the network is more vulnerable.

You write as though this hasn’t happened before.  Bitcoin whales have been manipulating the price for personal gain since the first exchange.  Why would Wall Street kill a golden goose when they can collude to make it lay golden eggs on demand?  There’ll be massive volatility up and down whilst the money fights for dominance until the price reaches levels that puts manipulation out of reach.
Also, Satoshi was smart but he wasn’t a perfect being.  Though Satoshi’s thoughts would be interesting, they’re akin to asking Bill Gate’s opinions on the current state of Windows using DOS as a basis for comparison.  Bitcoin’s technology doesn’t forever remain in 2009.  8 years is an epoch in software and hardware development.  Plus there’s dozens of people with a Satoshi level understanding of bitcoin and beyond it working within bitcoin today.

I disagree.  If the dichotomy is price discovery or bubble I’d say the recent price surge is just the beginning of price discovery.  When mother groups on facebook are having casual discussions about this cool way to make money, it’s not about to crash.  The price is remaining stable and rising despite mainstream media hatchet stories and widespread FUD.
I got that you were comparing the hysteria aspect but it’s apples to oranges.  Beanie babies have no intrinsic usefulness or value.  Bitcoin’s entirety is intrinsically useful and hence valuable and that doesn’t change whether a person who owns bitcoin understands it or not.

It’s a work in progress.  Greed drags people in and volatility either leaves people regretting their panic sells or hodling through their fear to be uplifted by the outcome.  
The latest upward swing is from the lesser of the big players of the financial world dipping their mitts into the tiny market cap which is bitcoin.  Bitcoin’s been through it before with the earliest adopters playing whale games with tiny market caps and it will survive this foray into the big bad world of finance the same way it survived the last several years.  At it’s most fundamental level, bitcoin is better money than fiat.

When the price rises sharply and suddenly the existing fees rise in value if wallets don’t adjust or people don’t change them and some people set fees even higher to get their transactions through.  It also adds alot of traffic from FOMO.  People who don’t want to transact with such high fees, don’t and whilst the price remains stable over time fees reduce until equilibrium between what people are willing to pay to transact and number of people wanting to transact gets reached.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:19:09
Alot of people pay alot more in fees than they need to which doesn’t help the perception of problem.  If you’re using a wallet where you can adjust the fees, there’s some fee estimators you could google and if you enable replace-by-fee you can send the transaction again with a higher fee if its taking too long.  Also, using segwit addresses lowers fees.

That’s a deferred non-solution.  “Someone else will figure it out”.  Moore’s Law is predicted to end soon.  That most people don’t run nodes isn’t really the point.  That people aren’t prevented from running nodes if they choose is what maintains decentralisation.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:13:34
Yep but scaling solutions are imminent, we’re talking about the current state of fees, so back to my original point, when the price is stable for a time, fees reduce and volatility is the cause of the perception that there are currently high fees.

It’s only speculative due to unstable pricing and the consequences of that.  When things settle down, when bitcoin is as stable a technology as TCP/IP then growth will be predictable, massive price spikes will be gone, fees will be eminently calculable, instead of the same  doubling or tripling in value or vlaue lost in the space of days and weeks.

Yes.  There's two blockchains which continue from the single originating blockchain or a copy of it. From 1st Aug they are independant of each other.  Your BTC date back to that original blockchain so you have coins on both sides.  Unless you access the other coin directly they'll remain where they are.

It might be considered by some to be sacrilege to say that Satoshi was a very smart human but still a human.  There are numerous very smart people working on bitcoin today and maybe some of them could have created bitcoin in different circumstances.  I don't personally believe Satoshi was or is infallible.  Bitcoin's solution to the general's problem is genius but there are other problems he didn't solve.  Deferring to Satoshi's "vision" in a pseudo-religuous fashion is naive at best.

Firstly, the value of bitcoin is *not* measured in FIAT.  That’s just something people focus on because it’s relatable.
What is money you ask?
Money allows people to swap things without having to always have the things they want to swap or even know what they want to have.  They can swap something for money and then swap money for something else later on.  (this is not patronising, it’s ELI5)
Bitcoin is a better way, in every sense, of keeping track of what others will swap with you and how much you have to swap than FIAT.
Reading up on the history of money would help you understand that your question doesn’t make much sense.

The community it spawned from are extremely toxic and have never not been.  Being hateful is their origin story.  It’s poster boy is a liar.  It’s most outspoken technical expert is a fraud.  It’s most well known mining advocate used covert ASICboost to gain an uncompetitive advantage and near monopoly over mining and mining chips/hardware.  BCH still allows covert ASICboost.
Despite big blockers having their own coin and their own subreddit they continue to insert their 0.09 bch  into bitcoin discussions and despite forking to specifically avoid segwit are now enthusiastically supporting S2X.
The core devs have demonstrated that scaling is not about throwing more Mb into blocks and have an intelligent, well thought out roadmap.  BCH has the EDA which was designed to attack and stagnate bitcoin’s hash rate.  It failed but it did cause some chaos.  We were all told by a BCH expert that if we want to run a node and don’t have the $20k required to support the hardware needed then we can go fuck ourselves.  I want to run a node and point my SPV wallets at it.  I’m not going to go fuck myself.

Bitcoin is a trustless technology, not an autocratic process controlled by a plutocracy.  As such, bitcoin can be used foundationally in pretty much any technology.  That’s its value.  It is to money what bartering is to the current monetary system.  Whereas money homogenised value store and exchange, bitcoin takes that further by completely replacing the need for oversight and trust.  With the right framework, money could flow through a complex change of ownership without a single human involved.  Try doing that with today’s fiat.
As for the concern about fees, and as you observed, they’re mostly a product of volaility.  I’d argue they’re also a product of a little laziness and bitcoin’s infancy.  Bitcoin goes up.  Previously cheap fees are now expensive.  If wallets don’t dynamically change fees, blocks get filled with expensive fees by transactions from the wallets with static fees and people who couldn’t be bothered changing them in wallets that can.  This fills blocks with high fee transactions.   This will improve with bitcoin’s technolgical maturation.
Edit: Big blockers argue more transactions per block will fix that.  If the whole world were using big blocks, the size of the ledger would become unmanageable and node specs required ridiculous.  They’re betting on technology keeping pace and deep pockets maintaining nodes.  I’d prefer a more certain solution.  Segwit, LN, Schnorr all produce predictable outcomes rather than gambling on the future of hardware tech.

Not really.  There’s a timeworn saying in the bitcoin community that if you don’t have the private key you don’t own the bitcoin.  My research before I dived in led me to create electrum wallets on a computer that never connected to the internet, write down the seed and transfer my purchased coins to them.  I monitored the wallets using the master public key on an internet connected PC.  That’s unhackable without breaking bitcoin or stealing my non internet PC.  Eventually I replaced it all with a Trezor.  I’m not a trader though so if you intend to be there’s a different methodology.
Keep in mind that bitcoin theft has limited, if any, legal recourse to retrieve the coins, so if they’re stolen it’s unlikely you’ll get them back.  The weak point is always the human element, be that passwords or brain wallets.  Rely on bitcoin’s inherent security and don’t trust anyone else with your security (only use open source wallets) and you minimise your risk.

There’s no ‘profit’ unless you cash out.  
Some people are here for the premise.  Not the value.  Not the price.  The idea.  And it’s an experiment.  
It could go tits up at any time.  So its unwise to invest so much it would cause problems losing it but taking a stand against the current, very flawed, system... that’s paramount.  
If you’re not willing to invest the time to research and choose which coin best serves your vision of humanity’s future then you’re not really in it for the evolution of human currency.  
There’s nothing wrong with being in it for the gains.  That’s part of the designed appeal.  But choosing one’s contribution to the experiment is part of what makes the experiment succeed or fail.  
If noone is in it except as a cash cow to be milked when a price threshold is hit then the whole thing is no better than a risky gamble and as a new form of value exchange it’s doomed.

Back in the old days, before forks and before eight decimal places, when bitcoin were spent by the hundreds and thousands, two communities rose to prominance.  The spenders believed that the utility of bitcoin was in transferring its ownership as an exchange for goods and services.  The holders (today they’re call hodlers but that’s a different story)  believed that scarcity was the key to bitcoin’s future.  No compromise could be found.
The spenders transferred ownership of their bitcoins to anyone who’d take them.  They created web sites known as faucets to give bitcoins to all those people willing to click a button.  One person even sent 10000 bitcoins to another person in exchange for two pizzas.  It was a happy time for spenders.  Soon it would get ugly.
Holders were aghast at all this frivolous spending.  They needed a plan to curb this use.  An insidious plot was hatched.  Darknet drug markets.  Cunning and simple.  It was perhaps the most shameful choice ever made by a group in bitcoin’s history.  A smallpox blanket decision which ruined countless lives.  Once set up, spenders addled by drugs could only make money selling them and pseudoanonymity meant law enforcement would catch up, putting spenders in jail.  The cherry for holders was that bitcoin’s rep as a spendable currency would be tarnished but it’s coolness factor with the kids would make bitcoin desirable to own.
Spender attrition from the above and exit scams were soon rife.  Many spenders turned to holding instead.  Holders had won for the most part.  Spending bitcoin wouldn’t become mainstream anytime soon.  The holder community could sit on their coins and watch their value grow over time.
Jump to today and battles are still being fought though holders are now called hodlers and spenders are no longer grouped by name.

Using your numbers (ignoring that segwit uses block weight and treating it as static 1Mb which it isn’t) and rounding up to 27 tx/s gives a maximum of ~2.33 million (86400x27) tx per day.  A very small fraction of the world can’t use it for one transaction a day.  So it doesn’t help with mass adoption.
To allow every person to make a single transaction a day, with an average bitcoin transaction of 250 bytes according to Gavin Andresen in 2014, that’s 7.6 billion x 250 bytes = 190 Gb worth of tx/day.  That’s 69 Tb/year added to the blockchain.  So nodes become server farms and decentralisation is gone.
To allow one transaction per person per day requires 7.6 billion transactions / 86400 seconds =  8796 tx/s.  To get through 8796 tx/s, compared to the current 1Mb (again, treated static for simplification though it’s not) and 3.37 needs a blocksize of (8796/3.37)x1Mb = 2.6Gb.
I couldn’t be bothered looking up numbers to calculate the processing required by a node or mining rig to get through all that data with reasonable speed but needless to say it would be enormous, if it even exists as a possibility today.  
Bigger blocks do not solve scaling.

The status quo of digital asset exchange development market is told by blockchain technology system development company
Last December, just as Bitcoin was still at its highest price of $18,000, everyone’s confidence in the digital asset industry was overwhelming. The exchanges at the core of the industry are even more prominent by the east wind. In the second quarter of the company's second-quarter exchange, the company's second-quarter profit was as high as 200 million US dollars, far exceeding the profits of the old international investment bank Deutsche Bank. A head-to-head digital exchange once heard the rhetoric that "we are the exchanges and do not need to go to the traditional exchanges." Source Zhongrui blockchain technology system development company development exchange, multi-currency wallet, blockchain application, etc. (13823116735 electric / micro) / / qq2670868238;
The digital asset exchange has earned a lot of money, and it has not taken traditional financial institutions.
Unexpectedly, the situation turned sharply, and the digital assets suddenly fell. In October, the volume of global digital assets decreased to 1/7 of the peak. Faced with a sharply shrinking transaction volume and a sharp drop in revenue, major exchanges have adjusted their strategies internally, streamlined their institutions, and started to actively raise funds, and began to backdoor to list.
There are two major categories of digital asset transactions, one is the transaction of legal currency and digital assets, referred to as the legal currency transaction, and the other is the transaction between digital assets and digital assets, referred to as currency transactions. These two types of requirements for regulation and compliance are vastly different. The legal currency transaction is the entry point of the digital asset world and the connection point between the digital asset world and the financial system, so it is of course the focus of all regulatory focus. The currency transaction is an internal exchange of digital assets. For the supervision, there is no difference in what kind of digital assets are held. Therefore, the regulatory authorities generally hold a laissez-faire attitude toward currency transactions. Therefore, the legal currency transaction is the most difficult bone, and it is also an indicator reflecting the degree of compliance of an exchange.
The development of digital asset industry has begun to encounter bottlenecks: digital assets with decentralization as the slogan, exchanges represented by centralized transactions are the core of the industry; the huge volatility and speculative nature of digital assets hinder their further development and The industry has been turning its attention to a stable currency based on the real financial system. Digital assets can linger in the new phase, but now they are beginning to encounter significant resistance because the higher the floor construction, the deeper the foundation should be. If digital assets continue to grow healthily, they will not be able to escape the support of the government and the support of the traditional financial system.
The importance of compliance. For exchange, safety is as important as air, and compliance is as important as water. The world's major exchanges have come out of their own unique path, fire money operations are frequent, technology, currency and user experience are very good.
In short, if the digital asset industry wants to take off again, return to reality, embrace regulation, and integrate into the financial system, that is the only way out.

Online exchanges generally require ID validation so you don't do crooked things like make them think you've given them fiat then charge back or use someone else's money or similar.  Took me a few days.  After that it's fairly quick if you use cash deposits.  BPay makes for a few days delay, at least for me.  Don't use online exchanges as a bank though and keep your coin in your own wallet, not their provided one.  Look into storage options if you're looking to hang on to bitcoin for a time.

He saw potential in bitcoin early on and became passionately involved.  He developed an almost cult like following as he made himself into an early poster boy of bitcoin.  Over the years his ego got the better of him and he decided that numerous people looking up to him meant he knew what was best.  He used his influence to try to force technologically naive vision for bitcoin on the ones doing the actual work, the developers.  When they said no and stopped listening, he had a big public sulk, started his own sub, started propogating fud and eventually became instrumental in bitcoin cash.
tl;dr. He's basically just a big baby who doesn't like being told no and with an army of followers to reinforce his sense of self worth to bitcoin.

People can invest in bitcoin for whatever reason they like.  That's the beauty of it.  If you want to dig into the technology and understand the reasons for bitcoin and how it works then great.  If you want to make a quick buck then fine.  If you want to casually invest or seriously gamble then that's ok too.  Bitcoin caters to everyone because it puts the power to make decisions about one's own wealth with oneself.    With that power comes responsibility.  The losers in this space only lose because they didn't act with due consideration.  You don't need to be smart, stupid, lucky or a survivor.  It is what it is and means different things to different people.

Bitcoin has the most experienced devs, the most experienced hodlers, the most experienced community and the best tech because bitcoin has only ever tried to be money.

Paypal is reversible.  Bitcoin is not.  Paypal “money” can be taken or kept away from its rightful owner.  Bitcoin cannot.
FIAT in all it’s forms isn’t owned by anyone except the government and can be stolen under some official guise at any time.  FIAT gets created out of nothing and given in vast quantities to those who already have the most.  As this happens, inflation devalues the “money” already circulating and erodes the wealth of those who earn the least.  FIAT is cronyism.  Bitcoin is true peer to peer.
That is the appeal of bitcoin.  The rest, scaling, speed, fees, etc, is just working through the details.

“If scaling bitcoin quickly means there is a risk of [Bitcoin] becoming Paypal 2.0, I think that risk is worth taking because we will always be able to make a Bitcoin 3.0 that [. . .] has the properties that we want. But I think we only have one really good shot at having bitcoin become the default platform for people to transact on across the world. We need to make sure we scale fast enough to allow these new people come onto Bitcoin, even if it means risking some decentralization or risking it becoming, like I said, Paypal 2.0”

When you're a kid, your first experiences with money used to be with physical cash.  Then as you got older you began to use money rather than cash.  Loans, cheques, ATMs, credit cards.  But it all started with knowing that if you were holding this many monies in your hand you could buy that many things.
Nowadays there's electronic currency in almost every game and young children are being exposed to that first rather than cash.  Many households don't even use cash regularly.  Attitudes towards what money is is changing and moving to a currency that's native in and intrinsic to the virtual, with all that entails, seems inevitable.

Before buying a Trezor I used the Electrum portable exe on a very old laptop that never connected to the internet, generated a wallet, wrote down the seed and copied the public key to a USB.  Then I transferred the coins from the wallet app on my phone, created a watch only wallet on my internet PC, securely deleted the wallet from the old laptop after confirming I could see the coins and hid the seed.
There's a few other ways such as printing out wallets but I liked that one.  I felt reassured by the fact my private keys were never on the internet.
If you want to take that path I suggest testing it with a small amount to make sure you can get the process to work for you first.

My instincts tell me its an attempt by corporations to seize control back from bitcoin so if ETH succeeds, the world loses.
Edit:  JP Morgan Chase, one of the main companies responsible for creating the instruments which led to the global financial crisis and which spawned cryptocurrency's implementation has lent its weight to ETH.  If that alone doesn't give you pause then you're mad.  ETH has already had its first bail out and brought about ETC.  How many more to come?

It's too late for ethereum.  At &gt;$300 and  place, people are going to buy in not because they believe in it but because they saw what bitcoin's price did from three years ago.  ie. only for profit hoping to ride in bitcoin's wake.
I would love to believe in ETH.  I spent the last couple of days researching and considering diversifying from just bitcoin but ethereum's political landscape is orders of magnitude more sticky than bitcoin's.  That and the technical difficulties, also orders of magnitude more numerous than bitcoin's, seem to be dismissed by believer's with a simple "Vitalik will fix it".
Bitcoin is a relatively simple response for the average person to the world's inherently unfair banking system.  ETH is a complex response to corporate interest in a bitcoin they can control.

What is it with these guys and quantum computer scams?
I hadn't heard about it tbh.  Only started paying close attention in 2014 and then only to bitcoin.  I did a few hours research into ETH because it started feeling like an opportunity before that was quashed.
Though I lack expertise to interpret the technical feasibility, after reading a few articles it seems like he was trying to sell an extraordinarily unethical and greedy idea.  It also seems (though maybe I'm talking out my ass) safe or even sensible to assume quantum computing can't be simulated with binary systems.  It makes me think Vitalik is dangerous too.  Smart enough to bamboozle and more than willing.

Dubbed UASF, this weapon renders his hashing power weak, destroys ASICBoost and allows the decentralised mining profits to be resurrected.  Unfortunately, however, his hashing power still retains some strength and it's enough to split bitcoin in two.

Because ASICBoost is incompatible with SegWit and the main retailer of mining hardware covertly uses ASICboost.

Or time travel to the past is unachievable.

Confirm same issue.  I was playing around with Jaxx.  Jaxx has a means of showing where the issue is.  Coin was received by shapeshift but an error occurred sending coin back.  It's coming up to two days without a response.  I thought shapeshift was reputable...  I'm still giving the benefit of doubt that support is slammed but 36 hours is a long time...

Message begging for my monies?  Not quite there yet.

Ah ok.  I was implying his name pretty much serves that purpose but I suppose not everyone has watched the bitcoin documentaries or researched the technology.
