then you sould continue and turn that 1 BTC to 1000 BTC. And then to 1M BTC if it is so easy.

Chuck Norris is able to decode the Private key from the BTC address. With pen and paper.

I think it is enough if one country which is already screwed in the fiat system turns to BTC. For example Venezuela. If they ditch their bolivar and start using only BTC they would be able to show the rest of the world that the BTC backed economy is working and after that there is no way back. They could easily become one of the richest countries. 
Adoption of internet started in wealthy countries, the poor countries will be the cradle of the BTC backed economy.

I am really sad it already happened. I wanted to acumulate for much longer for cheaper. I am not telling that I will not continue to DCA or €CA in my case.

Block 558780 in which your tx is included was mined 7 min and 47 seconds after the previous block 558779. If you pay enough fees than your tx is confirmed asap.
Next time also complain to your car maker that your car makes less miles (km) if you fill the tank for 20 compared 50USD (eur, whatever...)

I saw it yesterday. Shame that it only supports ETH now.

I take it as my savings account. I used to spend a lot for things like new phone, PC upgrade even if it wasn't necessary... Basically things that lose value in about 2-3 years. This money now goes to BTC and will stay in BTC forever as I am not planning to exchange it back to euro but spend it in the future.
