Oh, that's a connection issue.  When the app starts up it tries to connect to  and   If it can't connect, it'll display that error.  The emulator/nexus 5 isn't having that issue, but I'll try and get an old phone either tomorrow or the next day and see if I can reproduce it.
Thanks, again.

Thanks, I'll look into tweaking the animation speed and maybe making the font one size larger.
Sure, I can add a stats dialog.
Yea, definitely. My friend wanted me to do litecoin too, but I wanted to keep it simple for the first release.

Yep, I added basic stats to the next version, and I might add some more.  I actually pushed it to the play store a couple minutes ago, but it'll take 2 to 3 hours for google to push.  Thanks.

Thanks, I'll take a look at it.  I didn't do as much testing on gingerbread.  On first glance, it looks like it might be rendering the drops off-screen.

Hey, this is some shameless self-promotion.  But, I wrote what is essentially my first app for Android.  And it is based on the concept of listen to bitcoin.  One thing that is cool is that it will display the BTC transactions in different currencies using the current exchange rates, which I think is useful for new users.  Anyways, if you have some free time, check it out.  And let me know, if you have any suggestions, like the current audio just sucks.  Thanks!

Thanks, sounds good.  I'll change the default currency to BTC in the next update.

Ok, I published some gingerbread display fixes.  It'll take a few hours to hit the play store, but let me know if that fixes it for you.  Also, if you're not running gingerbread, let me know what version of Android you are running.  Thanks.

Okay, thanks!
