Thanks for taking one for the team.

Haha, I just asked my wife if this was possible.

It is real. It is due to the bitcoin cash fork.  At the time of the fork you automatically received the equivalent of your bitcoin holdings in bitcoin cash. The issue was coinbase held them until today when they started trading bitcoin cash.

Start by not going all in and use coinbase.

Sorry, should have been more diligent.

BI is click bait.

Did you even read the article?

Welcome to crypto trading! You have to have all accounts setup and fully funded months before any dips. Go back to Wall Street if you can’t handle it.

I bought at 1.3k

He runs a hedge fund and is trying to cause a dip because the moron missed the dimon dip.

The customer pays the transactions fees. Am I incorrect?

I answered my own question. The following Go Lang libraries are perfect for creating and distributing keys:
[Go-BIP32 Mnemonic Library](
[Go-BIP39 HD Key Generation Library]( )

I am right he has a broken arm, has to be due to bitcoin.

The recent bitcoin run got the attention of the entire world. Although many participated in it, many more first timers are doing their research and will enter the game this year.  I just started trading one month ago and tripled my investment. I also spent four months prior to that researching bitcoins and luckily decided the invest. Over the past two weeks, I convinced four people to start buying bitcoins and educated eight more on what they are. The second wave has started.

I only have to say one thing.
One Thing: A huge majority of the world has no fucking clue what cryptocurrencies are.  
Second thing: (only because I am drunk in Paris) As long as the technology behind blockchain is sound, we are similar to the Internet in 1995.
I was there in 1995, I was retired at 42 yo.
