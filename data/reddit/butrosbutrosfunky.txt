Well, NAB just nicely asked their bitcoin merchants to find another bank and gave them plenty of time to do it. Unlike ANZ, which just froze accounts and told people to fuck off one morning. 
Which is unusual, because NAB were the most popular and welcoming bank for dealing in BTC and BTC startups. Obviously somebody in legal had a conniption fit, and decided the whole scene was too hot right now.
Hopefully CoinJar can find another bank, perhaps even a credit union that will take their business. I don't doubt they will. They churn through a pretty significant transaction volume and all accounts are verified.

Oh God, your completely unfounded assertions and false equivalences and vague generalities about 'governments' have been dealt with more than once.
You're looking at a situation where at least 6% of all BTC has gone missing in action basically overnight, another chapter in the rampant mismanagement that has come to characterise so many BTC ventures, so much so that thieves and scam artists now own a probable plurality of all coins in existence. When someone mentions that BTC probably needs a better regulatory regime, you pop out with the glib statements.
As for cherry picking, basically every developed country (and many developing) have deposit insurance. However, you supply a list of crises that includes everything from the Weimar republic to Zimbabwe, as if this refutes, rather than emphasises the need for stable open government, proper regulatory frameworks and independent monetary policy.
If bitcoin really was just about global remittances and not piled on with the utterly garbage rhetoric about creating some new global order free of regulation like the OP's deluded statement implied, perhaps it wouldn't be such a big deal. Unfortunately so many people seem to treat it like the messianic solution to an utterly nonexistent problem.

Well, virtually every country had their telecom and other fixed infrastructure developed by a government 'natural monopoly' since they were associated with creating networks with high ratio of fixed to variable costs. For example, the fixed costs of establishing a national distribution network for a product might be enormous, but the marginal (variable) cost of supplying extra units of output may be very small.
Hence under certain conditions, like telecoms, a natural monopoly is actually the most price efficient way of creating such a network, as it eliminates unneeded duplication of key infrastructure and keeps costs down. France had the PTT, the UK had the GPO, Australia had Telecom etc, etc. It's basically universal.
Once the general infrastructure is in place, these monopolies were deregulated and sold off at least partially to private interests, but usually with minimum service provision agreements.

Fine, but so is taxation and the existence of the state. I simply don't understand the notion that while taxes are immoral, arbitrary control over land enforced by violence is. Libertarianism paints itself as some hyper-competitive non-coercive meritocracy, but in practice, it contains elements that make it inherently not so. It contributes to the formation of an idle, de-facto ruling class that derives it's mandate from having a bunch of land titled ancestors. Why would I want to live in such a society, or view it as inherently more 'just' than the one we have now?
You don't like paying taxes? Well fine, I don't like living in a situation where all the natural resources are locked up by a few people whom feel they don't have any responsibility to anyone other than themselves, and re-label this lopsided situation as representing 'freedom and liberty' The rhetoric versus reality simply doesn't align.

Bitcoin has had centralised checkpointing since Satoshi introduced it in 2010, for the same reasons Peercoin chose to utilise it in it's PoS model.
No coin has solved the decentralised checkpointing issue yet, but I understand the Blackcoin dev rat4 is working on a decentralised implementation.


This is patently false. PPC was never successfully attacked, and checkpointing has been part of the coin design from the start, and there is a detailed description of this in the whitepaper.


This is also false. Nodes listen for checkpoint broadcasts, but they have a choice whether or not enforce them. This makes the checkpoints reliant on community consensus, and prevents the dev from maliciously reorganising the blockchain against the communities wishes. Some PoS implementations like Primecoin and others have checkpoint enforcement switched off by default in the node software. This is identical to bitcoin where the dev's cannot hard fork the blockchain without a majority of the miners and nodes consensus.
These erroneous arguments get tossed around quite literally all the time. It's utterly ridiculous, and even if were true, would apply equally to the checkpointing mechanism in bitcoin.

First, Tom Woods is *not* an expert in constitutional law. He lacks even a law degree. The constitution is of course the highest law in the land, but SOCTUS has the final power of judicial review, which is the ability to interpret a statute or treaty for consistency with the constitution itself. Unlike Wood's opinion here (which seems to be more pandering to an ideological base rather than an actual description of fact) this is the established procedural norm in the USA, and is similar in most other common law nations.

Done. You don't need to track the personal history of every damn coin that hits your wallet. Just do first in and first out, and use a single exchange to estimate the value. You don't need to have obtained them form that exchange, it's just a consistent yardstick to determine whether your coins were worth more or less than they were when you exchanged them.

Well it was always taxable. Trading in any asset that fluctuates in USD (or insert national currency here you are taxed in) is potentially subject to capital gains tax in most jurisdictions. It doesn't matter whether it's gold, bikes, or fucking hopes and dreams if you could commoditise those.
The fact that everyone lost their minds here when the IRS stated something totally obvious is pretty mystifying.
@_date: 2014-04-09 06:04:42


As long as you can provide a reasonable best estimate, this shouldn't be a problem. If you neglected to keep ANY records of the origins of your funds, that's a tax issue with ALL assets. The onus is on you to keep records. Any asset that can reap you a potential capital gain should have been noted. You didn't need a press release from the IRS to make this basic element of taxation law a known requirement.
Since you didn't keep any records I can see, and your transaction history is a total kludge, you may have to overestimate your tax burden. Thems the breaks, but it's hardly a unique situation.

Am I responsible for your lack of knowledge? This isn't a fringe piece of information. Telecoms were initially created by government monopolies that were later deregulated and sold off to competing interests:
*For almost a century the key institutional feature of traditional telephony around the world has been a ubiquitous network operated by a monopolist. The operating entity was usually a government administration known generically as a PTT (post, telegraph, and telephone administration).*


That's not a claim I made. The fact is, it's the way it *did* happen. If you want to provide examples of this massive infrastructure being created successfully other ways, the burden of proof is on you to provide it. 


Just because you believe so, doesn't make it true.


No, I was making a point about fixed vs variable costs.
Somebody still has to build the last mile and interconnecting infrastructure. Overwhelmingly, that infrastructure was created by governments.
Also, your actual knowledge of telecommunications infrastructure is showing. You are confusing TCP/IP with with the physical layer.  


Not a refutation of my point. Most of those 'interconnected' networks are distributed by circuit-switched infrastructure, like ADSL for example.


Perhaps you should actually study some Orwell. Telecommunications has been largely through a process of deregulation, and the transfer of public assets to private interests, and a decreasing role of government in these networks. Your comments indicate you don't know much about the industry.

Well, I have. I cashed out quite a lot of bitcoins to make some purchases. My accountant at H&amp;R Block dutifully applied the appropriate CGT to the transactions based on the price I initially purchased them at and the price I sold them for. Even if I had exchanged the bitcoins directly for the laptop and a bunch of other crap I bought, they would still be subject to CGT because the value of such items *are a known quantity*


Totally irrelevant. Thats not how tax laws work.


You have just described the definition of a 'capital gain,' and it definitely does not have to be in the hundreds of thousands or millions for you to be subject to penalties if you don't declare them. For example, the shares I hold are not subject to CGT until I sell them or trade them for something else (any dividends of distributed to me while I own them are subject to CGT) and realise a profit or loss. I don't need to have to own hundreds or thousands of dollars worth to still be subject to penalties if I sell some shares at a profit and don't report the capital gain on my taxes.
You can hang on to your bitcoins, and as long as you don't actually do anything with them they are not subject to CGT. If you trade them for things which have value, the transactions involved become subject to CGT assuming you made a profit.
This is not some kind of new thing. You can choose not to declare any profits or loss from your BTC transactions on your taxes and take that risk if you want too, but I'm telling you how the basic law works. If you have a bunch of unexplained transactions on your bank account and are audited, the default behaviour is simply to treat those transactions as income for CGT unless you can prove otherwise. Then you would be subject not only to the outstanding tax liabilities, but also any penalties assessed.

Rubbish. Checkpointing in bitcoin will become more important than ever, since we are in the post 51% era. It's no longer hypothetical, so saying checkpointing in bitcoin could easily be discarded is frankly laughable given the situation. 


Again, untrue. Clients listen for set checkpoints, but are not required to enforce them. This makes their acceptance reliant on community consensus, and prevents a malicious dev reorganising the blockchain against the communities wishes. Primecoin nodes have checkpoint enforcement turned off by default for example, and Sunny King is even considering removing central checkpointing from peercoin entirely. The only time it would ever need to be used would be in the event of an attack anyway, whereby it would give nodes an option to easily recover.
PoW is not less susceptible to a 51% attack than PoS is based on how it is implemented, and that much is obvious since we are looking at a 51% PoW controlled bitcoin right now. Unlike PoW, where a 51% attack can be ongoing, a PoS 51% attack would be a one off event which would require massive ammounts of coin stake weight, which would be expended and reset on the attempt.
Decentralised checkpointing is a area of ongoing work, and I believe Rat4 from blackcoin has been working on an implementation for some time now.

But it hasn't, and it wouldn't. History is full of societies that used gold as the primary medium of exchange, and they hardly did so in the absence of the state, or a taxation regime. In fact, those governments exercised considerably more control over their citizens than the current ones do.

It's not. It's about as libertarian as gold, or a suitcase of cash. You can use many stores of value off the government books to evade taxation and the state, but it doesn't follow that you *have* or may even *want* to utilise them in this way.
Especially if more businesses start accepting BTC, you can bet they are going to want to keep things above board and within regulatory compliance. It's just part of a sound risk management and transparency for your stakeholders and shareholders.
Hell, I paid capital gains tax on my BTC profits last year. I'm sure there could have been a bunch of basically illegal but relatively easy ways to get around doing this, but I have no interest engaging in such behaviour.
Bitcoin definitely makes it easier to evade capital controls for certain countries, but even then that places those that engage in such behaviour at a some significant legal risk. This isn't something that everybody wants to engage in, or even something that *should* be engaged in from even certain ethical perspectives.
I've owned bitcoins in the past, and probably will in the future, an I think they represent an exciting technology. However I don't have any particular interest in using them to subvert the 'state.' I think they have potential as another currency/commodity class that behaves differently to others that has a place in the broader marketplace. Just like many people use gold as a safe harbour investment or to hedge for inflation, etc.
I think ascribing bitcoin as a 'Libertarian' or 'Anarchro-Capitalist' currency ultimately harms its adoption. Wedding it to political ideologies that are not shared by most contributes to its fringe status. Many of the prominent bitcoin criticisms (including my own) are not generally arguments against the notion of bitcoin itself, but the culture of groupthink that surrounds it.

Cyprus did freeze withdrawals for a while, so they could recapitalise their banks without a bank-run killing them off entirely and ensure insurance for depositors.

If I needed bitcoin to purchase something or move value specifically, I would buy some more to facilitate that, but the situation hasn't come up yet. So in that respect, I am an 'ex-bitcoin user' in that I don't and probably won't use it as a store of value again. Transaction wise, perhaps, but there has yet to be a killer app to make its use compelling for my individual needs yet.

That's a really convenient way to evade the fact that since 51% of the network hash of BTC can now be controlled, it's key feature (trustless transactions) is now compromised at a systemic level.

And that's an argument against what exactly? Certainly not a strong and regulated independent central banking system backed by regulatory oversight, not that I can see. Unless you are currently living in a current or recently former military dictatorship, this is not an issue regularly encountered.
In addition, retirement funds are not currencies. They are managed baskets of numerous investments. You can manage your own if you want, and invest it entirely in whatever you like. The whole point of an investment fund is managed risk to gain returns. This is not, however, the function or property of a transactional currency that goods are priced in.


That's completely at odds with the general sentiment in this forum. People get prickly if you even suggest bitcoin is more a commodity or speculative instrument than a currency, and can't wait to piss all over the perceived failings of fiat in this regard. They love to point out insane percentages of value lost in inflation, which only matter if you kept cash from 1920 buried in your garden for the duration. Nobody without *significant* money to invest gives a fuck about inflation as long as it's both small and predictable. Why? Because it's spent on real goods before it matters. If you have enough unspent wealth to spare that you worry about 2% worth of shrinkage per year you already have it invested in a diverse portfolio of inflationary hedged assets. For 99% of the population, bitcoin is a solution in search of a problem.


The FDIC is paid through insurance premiums, and it's been unbeliveably successful at ameliorating financial dislocations that otherwise would have decimated whole communities and industries.

FINCEN doesn't consider it money, just like they don't consider gold money.

This undermines the key aspect of bitcoin that assumed nobody could do such a thing, and it's that aspect that made bitcoin TRUSTLESS, and thus revolutionary.

No all of these were speculative bubbles based on erroneous potential estimates of what the news entailed.

2. There's almost no evidence actual Cypriots were purchasing bitcoin, simply the perception that they were.
3. The third bubble was caused by the Chinese trying to evade capital controls, a loophole that is increasingly getting closed.
Each of these events lead to a pump and then a dump, not a sustained 'save harbour' investment. It's reasonable to assume that a financial crisis may actually force people to dump their BTC investments in favour of more stable investments like gold.

I've done my homework. Gold and silver are charged at 28% CTG. Unless you are using US legal tender collectible gold and silver coins at their face value, but only a complete fucking moron would do that, since the losses would be far higher than anything CGT could inflict.
Besides, if you are transacting for their face value, you are trading in USD again. As we have shown, the USD to USD rate does not fluctuate, so its NOT subject to CGT. The value of your collectible coins do, however, and if you trade them at a rate not indicative of their face value, you ARE subject to CGT.

If it's regulated as property, you only pay tax on 'realised' gains, that is gains you make relative to USD when you spend or convert it to USD. Simply holding BTC has no tax liability. If you were to regard BTC like a currency, you would be taxed on ALL gains, even unrealised ones.
It's MUCH worse. Fucking cap gain reporting should be easy as shit to implement into software. Mitigating a massive increase in your tax liability because it's treated like other foreign currencies? NOT SO MUCH.

Yeah, and bitcoin seems to have one every other week. People haven't lost any money in FDIC insured dollar amounts since the 30's when it was introduced in response to the crash that caused the great depression.
Even the folks in the Cyprus crisis were covered for deposits under 100 000 Euro, and that particular predictable collapse of a tiny tax haven with barely any industrial base beyond it's export of dodgy banking services has been used by bitcoin cheerleaders in more threads than I care to mention.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:03:27
The thing is you *can* use gold as a currency. I can quite easily purchase a bunch of gold coins and bars in various weights for untraceable cash, keep them in a safe and use them as an easily convertible method of exchange or a simple store of value. 
Sure, the transaction costs associated with this are higher than something like bitcoin over long distances since it's a physical medium, but that only really comes into play when you are dealing with quite large amounts. Even then, there are ways around this by using gold deposit certificates from trusted third parties (an imperfect solution sure, but one that has been very reliable in the past for literally hundreds of years).
However gold hasn't broken down the state, or substituted cash for most transactions. Just like I don't think bitcoin is going to. The advantage of the current central banking system is it provides a relatively stable value for most transactions with a predictable and targeted inflation rate, low enough not to be problematic for anything other than long term holding.
I think BTC with it's deflationary model will remain susceptible to a more fluctuating value and shocks like previous gold backed currencies and gold in general. In other words, in times of financial uncertainty, value will flow into BTC from other investments spiking the price and flow in the opposite direction when conditions improve for other asset classes making it difficult to manage risk for everyday transactions.
I think BTC is not going to replace other currencies precisely *because* it is deflationary. I don't think many people outside certain libertarians *want* to exclusively do business in a deflationary currency. Using it as another traded asset class with a bunch of excellent protocol advantages? Sure! We can even see examples of this in the relatively small crypto currency movement. Entire ecosystems of different crypto currencies are currently being traded between each other for cash and crypto coins, often for risk management and diversification.
Bitcoin I think is definitely going to have a place in the global economy. But to say it's going to become the ONLY global currency is, I think, a naive fantasy promulgated by a certain ideological group. History offers no such precedent.

Bitcoin could be plenty revolutionary if it was used even only primarily as a remittance network. It cuts right into existing networks like debit cards and paypal. The fact merchants don't hold bitcoin means relatively little, they are in retailing, not speculation. I'm selling shit on ebay to somebody in the US, I don't hold onto USD either, I have it converted automatically into my local currency. 
Bitcoin's value could stabilise simply due to it's volume used in intraday international trade. The fact that people don't settle *all* their debts in bitcoin seems to be missing the point.

Yes, but you can wire more than $50 000 a year. The Chinese can't, which was why there was that huge value spike. They were using it to evade the capital controls.

@_date: 2014-03-08 04:47:38
People forget that when GOX started having withdrawal issues, many people here blamed it on the big bad government trying to crush bitcoin and cast GOX as a relatively innocent victim in the process. Many others pointed out that this wasn't the case but a plain case of GOX not doing its regulatory due diligence, but I wouldn't say this was a universal view.
When fiat withdrawals started encountering delays, the BTC price on GOX jumped by a good 5-10% over the regular market price of bitcoin. If you were holding on to quite a lot of cash on GOX at the time, I could understand the reticence to take a massive financial hit to buy said coins so you could transfer them somewhere else.
Obviously there were a lot of warning signs, and no holders after the problems started emerging would transfer their coins into GOX. Unfortunately, for the people who still HAD money or coins in GOX, it was a difficult position to be in. Move your money out in BTC and lose a chunk of your funds, or try and wait out a fiat withdrawal. I really don't blame the people who had coins/fiat stuck in GOX for their loss. 
Also, like it or not, BTC is a speculative currency. In many ways, its value is reliant on exchange volume. Simply saying 'hold all your BTC in a paper wallet' isn't really a solution when you need to make time sensitive trades. Getting BTC into an exchange from a paper wallet to execute a trade can take anything from 10 minutes to half an hour. When the shit starts hitting the fan in the form of a massive price crash or swing or news release or whatever, this delay is just too fucking long.
I understand many people in this sub are in BTC for the long haul, and don't so much as trade but simply accumulate BTC in long term positions. However, that isn't everybody, and like it or not, the value of your cold storage wallets is largely a function the ability of BTC to Fiat liquidity. So don't be so fast to vilify people who leave funds on exchanges. It's a risk, but so is BTC in general.

What are you talking about? Bitcoin is already subject to capital gains tax by the ATO in Australia.

I've yet to find any developed country with a mature tax code that doesn't already have existing mechanisms for the taxation of something like bitcoin. The fact that the name of the asset you trade in hasn't been explicitly mentioned for you in a press release means nothing when it comes to capital gains (no matter *what* you have invested in).
The IRS here has done nothing material other than clarify the existing laws that it has on the books.
Even if the Australian Tax Office classed bitcoin as a 'foreign currency' (which they don't) you would still be liable for CGT:

The way these things generally work is that share trading remains halted, the company goes into liquidation and it's assets are sold off to cover the debts of it's creditors. Shareholders are in basically the last tranche to get anything left over, so all debts with other creditors get settled first. Like staff salaries, then people owed outstanding loans, landlords, etc etc.

These links are simply a restatement of your erroneous argument. Proof of Work is considered a solution because it requires expending energy, making mining on the most likely to be accepted chain the only rational choice.
However, this assumption is obviously completely moot if you control a majority of the hashrate and energy expediture. Then it is YOU who controls the consensus on what is mined. Which is essentially the situation facing BTC right now. BTC obviously needs centralised checkpointing now just as much as any PoS coin. 
There are many implementations being worked on to prevent the 'nothing at stake' issues of PoS. PoS minting requires a huge delay while your staked coins are unusable until they are confirmed by many blocks (520 I think in peercoin for example, but this number can be different depending on implementation) or about 8 hours. Using tree chain aware nodes, double minters could easily be identified during this maturity period and ignored, and penalised by having their stake weight reset on the main chain.
PoW is not only just a waste of energy, the model has now been shown to be demonstrably deficient in it's singular aim of securing the blockchain. None of the dismissive articles you offered here make any reference to multipools or the fact that energy expenditure as a security mechanism inherently centralises hash among an ever diminishing number of institutional players that can exploit economies of scale and location to obtain cheap energy.
Indeed, if energy expenditure is the sole metric, it's really only a matter of time before institutions through investment become entirely vertically integrated to control both ASIC development and deployment and then, *bam* you have bitcoin Standard Oil. Consumer based PoW then becomes insignificant, if it isn't already.
PoS is not affected by any of these problems, and the issues it has are trivial in comparison. It's also entirely future technology agnostic, where the same cannot be said for PoW.

Your claim is a bullshit 'right' you believe should be respected just well... Because. It's probably the most flimsy justification ever. Apparently taxation is some hideous theft, but merely locking up the geography in an arbitrary fashion for your own exclusive purposes and leveraging it for your own taxation on others isn't.

If all the gold exchanges were run as shitty as the bitcoin ones are, barely anybody would trade in it.
Like it or not, but since Bitcoin is an asset class, it can't easily be divorced from the community that surrounds it or it's owners (whom increasingly are basically thieves or incompetents). There's no point in owning bitcoin if this is the investment landscape. Bitcoin's value is derived from it's trade. If the mechanisms of all such trade are basically fucked, then the 'purity of the protocol' is essentially a moot point.


I assure you, that being such a minority, they are not countless at all.


Basically all the exchanges operating under any level of transparency at all are doing it under existing regulatory regimes that essentially compel them to do so. Most of these requirements take away a huge chunk of many of the advantages bitcoin was supposed to offer over existing settlement methods. The ones that don't generally seem to either steal your coins, collapse or both.

As somebody with a history of chronic major depression, I know that feeling of utter despair and guilt and self loathing that can just morph into an unfeeling sense of nihilism. Suicide isn't a solution to pain though, it just spreads it around to others that care about you (and they do, despite how much you might think they are better off without you).
The most important thing to remember here is you *haven't* lost everything. All that stuff you no longer have didn't just arrive in your lap... You made it. The thing that made it is you. You still have that brain of yours. That's the most valuable thing of all, and nothing you did in the past has affected your future potential. Things are going to be tough for a while, but in the scheme of life, this is not the end. It's a new beginning.
I always suffer from the notion that my future is all behind me. The best days are past, and I've squandered my life. But that is bullshit thinking, and essentially so common it's almost a fundamental part of the human condition. You can speak to almost anyone at any level of success or age they often lament the same notion. But really, the best of you is probably yet to come.
In conclusion, I'd say that every bad decision you have ever made in your life is ultimately solvable. Every single one, other than carrying out the decision to end your life. That's the ONLY one that can't be undone. Don't make that mistake.

'For thousands of years' is not today, where we have a diverse mix of assets and long distance instantaneous mediums of trade to utilise. So, it's not incorrect at all. If handling specie were the only way of carrying out trade, you might have a point, but it's not. And bitcoin *certainly* isn't.


That all derive from its value as an asset. Nobody is going to piss away money mining coins and processing transactions otherwise. Also 'block chain technology' isn't a unique to bitcoin anymore at all.


'A few people' got ripped off 'literally millions of people' use it everyday (a huh). Are you are not a tiny bit in denial? Gox lost almost 7% of all coins in existence. That percentage is going to be significantly higher when you account for the huge early wallets created that have never moved and probably nobody has access to.
Seven percent in one exchange fuckup. ONE. No numbers you could supply even come close.

Where do you live exactly? Obviously not in an OECD nation if you think this is a problem. The very conditions that lead to bank and currency failures are ones associated with lax or unenforced regulatory regimes and bad oversight.

This argument is basically 'begging the question.' In other words, it's erroneously assuming a conclusion in it's premise. From what I can understand, he claims Bitcoin was created with a libertarian aims in mind (probably true), and therefore the implementations and uses of this technology will always be inherently politically libertarian. This is where his argument collapses entirely.
To repurpose his argument in a similar context... the Internet was created by the US DoD for the purpose of creating a resilient computer network in the event of nuclear war. Therefore, the Internet will always be an inherently statist and militaristic technology designed to allow the uninterrupted continuity of state control, regardless of any future implementation.

Treating it as a currency massively undermines people using it as a store of value. They have to pay CGT on their *unrealised* gains, even if they don't spend or trade it. So, ironically, they will often have to trade some of it to pay their tax liabilities. Hello bitcoin crash every April!
Under the current IRS rules, BTC capital gains are only applicable when the asset is sold or traded for something else. Automated reporting should be incredibly easy to implement in software.
Also, the IRS didn't make rules retroactive, as much as they clarified existing laws regarding CGT. Anyone who wasn't declaring their capital gains on assets they sold needs to find a better accountant, whether that asset was bitcoins, stocks, or the tears of baby unicorns. Tax laws don't need to specify the instrument you made your gains in for it to be covered.

Well jokes aside, your version of the truth is a total fallacy. The ANZACS in Gallipoli didn't "[make] made the ultimate sacrifice in the defence of our ideals and in defence of our freedom..." They were used as cannon fodder in a conflict serving a largely uncaring British Empire. The fate of the ANZACS should make us angry at the pointless slaughter they were subjected to, however instead we have invented a bogus narrative that recasts their deaths as ensuring our freedom and way of life. 
This is complete bullshit. The story of the ANZACS is one of tragedy, the waste of young lives and leadership incompetence. Instead of learning some lessons from that horror, we have reinforced a notion that the cause they were fighting for was noble and beyond reproach, and had something to do with our 'freedom.'
Instead of a cautionary tale that we should mournfully reflect on the kind of mentality that needlessly wiped out a whole generation of young men, it's exploited again and again to assert the nobility of purpose behind their deaths. I find it sickening.

No, thats not true. If I exchange 1 Bitcoin I bought for a dollar directly for a bike worth $500, I just made a $499 capital gain. It's the same as if I traded ownership of shares or gold to somebody directly for a good or service without cashing out into dollars before I do so. My CGT liabilities would be assessed on the market price of the goods at the time of the trade.


Practically, that's correct, but it's basically the same as doing 'under the counter' off books transactions in cash. It's a tax evasion technique that pretty every tax collection agency has decades of experience dealing with.


Sure, thats basically true. It's a like a lot of real world circumstances. My point is that there is not something about BTC as an asset class that makes it legally immune to tax.

This isn't a big deal for using BTC as currency. It's utterly trivial to implement reporting in clients. Your phone will do all this shit in a few months, or sooner, and syncing across devices is utterly trivial.
I already paid cap gains tax on my BTC profits last year since they all flowed through my bank account and it would have been foolish not to. It wasn't easy, and took a couple of hours to work out. If my clients had some way of easily outputting the relevant data, it would have been a fuckton easier.
Look at it this way, trading in stocks is subject to CGT. I have no idea how anyone did this before computers. My trading platform emails me a statement every tax time that makes submitting any CGT obligations take like, 5 seconds on a website. But they did. They dealt with huge piles of sifting paper, but they traded anyway. We have powerful computers even on our phones that can do this drudge work for us now. Electronic currency? Electronic reporting, easy as pie.
It should be fucking easy to implement the same on the client side.
If somebody develops some standardisation for bitcoin accountancy, the details should be easily synced between different platforms.
I hate to be the 'this is actually good news' guy, but clarification on regs IS actually good news. People bent on avoiding the government can continue to proceed as normal with how they use Bitcoin, and those that want to remain in compliance will have access to tools to ensure that.
What's not to like?

That's pretty much right on the button in that it's easy to *spend* bitcoins, but not so easy to *obtain* them. Most exchanges are hosted overseas and rely on international wire transfers, and there is a not unjustified distrust of the whole sector at the moment. Other more local ways of obtaining bitcoin aren't really exchanges at all, like coinbase or coinjar (in Australia) they function more like bitcoin dealers rather than true exchanges. Either that or you can buy them for cash directly from a stranger, but that's way out of most consumers comfort zone (and mine, for that matter).
That would tend to indicate that people owning existing bitcoins are using them to spend on things more as new opportunities arise and infrastructure expands, but there is not the associated new money from consumers coming in to keep the price buoyant.
The thing holding up bitcoin now is not that you can't find places to spend them, it's that buying them is a stressful and non-trivial process.

How does this insight assist me in any practical sense whatsoever? It's like assessing Communism on its goals rather than the reality of it's implementations.
One day in the future we may all live in some bitcoin utopia where all money is regulated by some decentralised trust model (there's a few problems with this, too, but I digress) however until then, bitcoin largely *increases* the transaction cost associated with trade rather than mitigates it. Even merchants currently accepting it directly largely convert it straight back into their local currencies rather than holding it.
Not to mention, tonight I purchased three items overseas online, had my transactions processed instantly and didn't even touch a bitcoin. What does it really have to offer me? A small reduction in processing fees that is largely offset by the problems I just enumerated?

Bitcoins are taxed as capital gains practically everywhere. They certainly are in Australia where I am.
It's not that hard. Just do what I did last year, work out the capital gain you made based on selling coins when the proceeds hit your bank account.
Didn't do any of that, only exchanged your coins for goods directly? Then relax, the lack of any reporting from merchants means you have nothing to worry about until it gets in place. Feeling honest? Just make up a reasonable estimate.
When I talk about software stuff, I'm not necessarily talking just about the block chain, I'm saying that basically the wallet software will take care of it. Whether its in your phone or whatever.
I own a lot of shares. I'd be utterly fucked if my online brooking service didn't email me a nice automatic statement every year regarding my transactions.

I don't think this is an accurate depiction of arguments against libertarianism. 
Libertarians tend to believe in an exclusive focus on so called 'negative rights' and believe state extensions of so called 'positive rights' to some of it's citizens represent immoral coercion since they are funded by a mandatory taxation regime.
Critics of libertarianism (like myself) believe that negative rights are only of limited practical utility in in ensuring a just society. Many believe that exclusive focus on solely on negative individual rights means little without some measure of positive economic rights. Even John Stuart Mill recognised this.
We can go back and forth disagreeing about this until we are all blue in the face, but essentially my beef with libertarianism is it frames many issues (particularly those of coercion) as immutable moral issues without considering the broader framework of practical societal outcomes. Since I consider myself a preference utilitarian, I generally place a high emphasis on overall societal outcomes. 
If I could see a functional libertarian Nozick style 'night watchman state' without the massive inequalities I think would result, I might be convinced. 
If I saw an AnCap society that didn't stratify into essentially the feudalism I predict it would I might also be convinced. 
Ultimately, I think economic coercion can be just as damaging as government coercion. However, I think stable and democratic systems of governance provide the best conditions to allow their citizens to prosper.

One completely misunderstood news item and two completely unrelated graphs.
China pursued a policy of the state aggressively selling the yaun for foreign exchange, to assist in artificially keeping it's value low and making it's exports cheaper to overseas markets. They are now pursuing a less state interventionist strategy in their currency since it was distorting the market too much and putting the breaks on the economy.
Somehow, you see this pretty prosaic example of yet another Chinese market liberalisation as some garbage about how 'China doesn't want dollars anymore.'

No, not necessarily. Legal theory makes a distinction between personal and private property, and so do many political and economic theories.


Well there is noting stopping private property being used as a tool for extortion or genocide either. Refer to the Irish Potato Famine for examples:


Except you are just arbitrarily defining these 'rights,' especially the latter one of rights to 'property.' Rights are socially constructed, they are not simply 'imbued' as much as you might want them to be. You seem to believe only in the existence of negative rights, when I think these are useless for a just society without recognising the importance of some degree of positive rights.


This is just a rationale for excusing horrible and unnecessary outcomes. History is full of exploited underclasses never owning property, and it's not by virtue of their not working hard enough. This simply a thin and fallacious justification for maintaining a permanent and stratified underclass. We know what these societies look like, they have existed before and they sucked.

The problem I find is that there are many places where almost any behaviour is effectively unregulated, but where parties lack access to a transparent and well functioning system of dispute resolution problems arise.
The prohibition example is a good one. Alchohol was illegal, so disputes between market players could not be settled in the courts, therefore they were settled by violence. It's not so much that the state just made these things illegal that made them problematic, it's that they were blocked from taking part in the regulatory framework of the state and it's dispute mechanisms. If the prohibition players were smart like ancaps seem to want communities to function, the main source of violence should have only been between the state and organised crime because the crime families would have created lasting, peaceful and functioning adjudicating mechanisms between themselves. Unfortunately the most brutal and frequent violence in these contexts generally takes place between the market rivals rather than soley against state enforcement. Mexico is a good example of that right now.
Likewise, where I live, prostitution is legal and well regulated. As such, while there are still isolated examples of human trafficking etc, these are minimised to the point where their incidence is effectively zero. However, the key here is *regulated.* There are plenty of places where you can find prostitution functionally tolerated or legal, but are rife with the race to the bottom of human slavery etc because proactive legal interventions to enforce regulation do not take place.
These are some of the issues I have. Not also withstanding that blaming 'govt identification' for issues like identity theft seems a bit too simplistic. Companies already have access to much more extensive and better technology to verify identity, but it's theft is more rife than ever.

A money printing machine that you literally just need to plug in and switch on is not something that benefits significantly by the value add of 'management skills'.

It's hardly 'sour grapes' to be skeptical about these kinds of people who talk endlessly of their abilities to score you over 1000% investment gains within 12 months. 
Anyone can selectively talk up their good performing stock tips with the benefit of hindsight. Did this guy invest his is own money in any kind of volume that would justify his prescience? Given this guys pimping of his own success, his ability to pick 1000%+ investment gains in the windows he talks about would suggest he would be worth hundreds of millions, if not billions by now. Is he? Or does he just earn the majority of his cash making recommendations to other people who assume all the risk?
If all he said was "you should invest in this" without actually exercising any risk himself, than this is little more than just jerking off.

From your post I doubt you are using bitcoin to eat, or do any daily spending. You are hoarding it, which is the *substance of my point.*


You didn't need to read any further? You don't think people save? You're, well, an *idiot* if you really believe this. Perhaps where you come from that is the norm, but I assure you, it's not universal. Where I come from for example, some form of contributed saving is *mandatory.*
In any case, I am not commenting on how *common* saving is I'm talking about the mechanism of how it's carried out. You've managed to miss this TWICE now, with your irrelevant and asinine "nobody saves" bullshit. Probably because you stopped reading.


Of COURSE it won't solve this huge problem. Bitcoin is just ANOTHER currency. It's not even the only fucking *cryptocurrency* that's actively being transacted right now... If you think it's going to supplant everything else I can't help but think you have rocks inside your head.


I understand inflation. That literally changes *nothing* about the point I was making. Can you read?


I haven't changed a fucking thing. For Christ's sake, the *example* I gave was specifically one of an absolute gain.


Good God, I've heard some stupid stuff from you, but this really takes the cake. There is NOTHING about what currency you use in this context that makes the slightest bit of relevance to my point. You think fractional reserve banking was a thing when Adam Smith was alive? Take some ECON101 before you pretend to know what you are on about.


I do grant you that at this time, you cannot use Bitcoin everywhere, and it is difficult to get hold of, but that does not mean it is therefore "a commodity", neither does it mean it is being hoarded and therefore scarce. These are the two central points you seem to be making and neither of them are correct.
I was making a point about how the potential usage of bitcoin has effects on its value. You have seemingly not paid attention to my initial or subsequent replies and I believe are arguing against an imaginary position I never made. I literally don't know what else to tell you, because you talk past every point I make.

@_date: 2013-10-01 06:23:52


Which ones? In every one that it's ever been tested, courts have upheld the opposite perspective. The fact that 'bitcoin' hasn't hasn't been specifically mentioned in a court decision *everywhere* doesn't make it any more of a conceptually grey area than the theft anything else that has value. You don't need specific laws on the books regarding the theft of baseball cards to make stealing them illegal, for example. 


This is not how the law works. Context matters, and in legal proceedings it's not difficult to establish. The fact that somebody isn't up to your standards of 'smart' also means nothing.


See above. This isn't a uniquely undefined area. It's trivial to apply based on existing legal norms.

@_date: 2013-09-17 19:20:27
Many market participants would prefer to choose whether they want their BTC to be hedged in USD or not depending on how the goods were priced, because they do/don't want to be exposed to BTC volatility while their claim is adjudicated. That means some party is going to have to offer a hedging service in addition to escrow, which increases currency risk for the folks offering the service.

There is nothing stopping the bank giving that loan out in say, the form of a cheque however, or crediting an internal account or one at a co-operating institution. Neither approach puts anything on the blockchain, and relies on the bank(s) own settling mechanisms. This is functionally identical to how FRB started, issuing deposit notes for gold, which is just as physically impossible to duplicate.
This of course requires quite a lot of faith in the banks themselves, but the market sets the rate at which people are compensated for risk. Banks will also co-operate in clearing/backing/settling each others transactions too. I'm not saying BTC does not create new challenges to FRB, but it's still definitely possible.

However, first you have to get your value *into* bitcoin. Usually takes 24 hrs, unless you are prepared to find somebody in person or take a massive fee on ordering via credit-card. Then you have to get the value back *out* of bitcoin at the other end, which assumes a local exchange or again, somebody you can find in person. Hopefully, during this 48 hr lag period, the volatility and transaction hasn't erased a portion of your funds exceeding $30 but hey, you might have even got lucky and *made* money, but it's hardly good risk management practice.

Bitcoin lacks *any* fundamentals. It pays no dividends, has no industrial nor cosmetic/decorative uses, it lacks even any physical locus in 3 dimensional space. It's worth only the entirely arbitrary and abstract value people project upon it. It's *useless* beyond being a medium of exchange, and only useful in that respect directly in proportion to the confidence people hold in it. It has the same "fundamentals" as cowrie shells or coloured beads... Not to say it might be useful, but you really have *no* idea what *funamentals* means in this context. Even fiat currency is backed by Govt issued debt in the form of Treasury Bonds, which is in turn funded by taxation...

Umm, why? Honestly, this 'hoarding is good' argument is so freaking counterfactual I almost hesitate to ask what the reasoning is here. This is the first time I have heard someone talk about how good it is for a currency *not* to actually touch the market.
The less something is utilised and the more it's hoarded, the more volatile it's value swings are going to be because it's liquidity is constricted. Just look at that bubble in April. It's no good holding on to BTC if the only thing you can buy with it is *other currencies* due to the fact nobody *spends* it. Bitcoin price will still grow if it isn't hoarded, and it will actually grow in less volatile fashion that is dictated by the growth rate of the BTC economy.
Fair enough if you want to hang onto your BTC and not spend it, but don't engage in the fallacy of rationalising this behaviour as some kind of noble pursuit..

They don't eliminate it, they may mitigate it in certain discrete scenarios however they cannot change what is a functional reality of the bitcoin network.


Perhaps it's just not worth accepting bitcoin either, if that's your flippant attitude to business risk. Also, the value people place on 10 minutes is so different we can be talking about vastly different sums than those represented by  lattes. Placing a 10 minute opportunity cost on everything is a *significant* transaction cost, and you are being silly if you don't recognise that.


Um no. Long strings of zeros are a functional pain in the ass to deal with. It's not easy at a glance to tell the difference between values preceded by more than 4+ zeroes, or remember them. Also, you've spent most of this thread shitting all over fiat currency, but now you say it's essential to determining bitcoin valuation? Riiiiight.


Setting aside the fact you have really no idea what 'John Smith' wants, making exotic hardware a necessity for the network is troublesome, because it decreases the democratisation of the currency and could affect even security. Making it feasible for average participants to participate in verifying the block chain (and mining too!) is definitely a positive.
In short, all you have done is wave away any concerns without actually recognising that they may be legitimate. Enjoy that fantasy world where nothing innovates and we have literally arrived at the end of cryptocurrency history.

The majority of interbank stuff goes over a messaging service defined by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication or just SWIFT. Pretty much every bank uses this to move money, especially between different national juristictions, because it's an agreed upon protocol. I knew a guy in IT where I worked who was in charge of making all our transactions work properly with our SWIFT gateway. Holy shit, talk about a stressful job... If something fucks up on your end (often) you can only be disconnected from the SWIFT network for a certain small amount of time before the whole bank loses its fucking certification. 
He told me he knew a guy who worked at a major national isp/telco ops centre who handled this this shit for a whole *bunch* of top tier banks...

Banks were completely open about this, and people took on the risk because banking reduced transaction costs accociated with just using cash. Nobody forced anyone to use banks for fucks sake, however stability was required to prevent capital shocks.

I didn't make any moral claim. The fact is such securities are illegal in most juristictions and carry penalties. So if if you want to get fined, or risk having the issuer shut down by the SEC or whatever and thus losing your investment, by all means, feel free to engage in such behaviour.

Interesting, and kind of a cool novel solution. However, several issues:
1. These coins have bitcoin denominations listed on them (QUARTER BITCOIN) which seems totally misleading, given the value of both bitcoin *and* silver fluctuate daily. You have printed a denomination on something at the mercy of *two* volatile indicators!
2. The QR link on the back obviously links to some kind of spot price quote, but who runs this site and what are the garantees regarding the uptime, and whether or not the link will remain valid in the long term?
3. How are these substantially different from a normal silver coin of a known weight, apart from having "bitcoin" stamped on them?

You haven't actually refuted a single one of my points.


If the currency is not circulating, it's illiquid and and it's value is volatile. Are you purposely avoiding my point? Also it's ultimate scarcity may come from the 21 million number, but it's value sure is derived by the people holding on to it. Buying it up and keeping it off the market drives up it's value and scarcity. I'm not 'plain wrong.'


I'm occupying the planet where most people who save do not do so by "stuffing cash under the mattress," and I think that point was obvious.


Congratulations, but this addresses the substance of nothing.


Then you are hoping the currency is going to *increase* or remain at the least *static* via relative gains. Rephrasing it doesn't make your point functionally different.


Again, with the "You're wrong, I do this for a living" stuff. Congratulations, again, but you are arguing against simple economics going back to Adam Smith. Competition in business is a reality, but gains are not strictly relative, and as economies expand they deliver gains to all participants. This is not the same as profiting via investment in a single, fixed commodity, where gains must by definition come at the expense of other players.


I understand this, but if it's treated it more like gold and less like cash, *this can adversely affect it's stability as a currency.* I thought I was making that simple point rather clear.

You can, easily, by taking the transactions off the blockchain. This is already happening in several places.
Picture this, bank offers you interest if you deposit your coins with them. It keeps track of the coins on an internal ledger, not the blockchain and loans them out to others. It uses the interest from these loans to pay depositors. The depositors risk is compensated by their depositing interest rate. This is functionally identical to how banks work with cash. 
As long as there isn't a simultaneous bank run, everything works fine. Sure with bitcoin you can keep everything in your own wallet and on the blockchain, but banks could make depositing with them attractive via offering a competitive interest rate. This model is as old as moneylending itself.

Exactly, and there is nothing stopping bitcoin being used in this fashion. You can argue that 'it's no longer bitcoin' but the accounts will be tallied in BTC and real BTC will be available over the counter if customers ask for them, just as they would for physical cash. Functionally, it's identical. We don't regard electronically settled currency as being valued any differently to the physical kind, and if banks start keep a seperate ledger off the block chain, then there is really nothing different here. You've moved into the territory of semantics. Bitcoins will be coupled to bank funds the same way physical cash is.

Oh dear. I appreciate the ideological sentiment, but your judgement is emotionally clouded.


And yet the inflation rate is still only around 2% p/a, well within the targeted rate, gold hasn't broken significantly out of its long decline, equities are increasing in value relative to traditional inflationary hedge assets and the USD is one again out valuing other strong currencies relatively unscathed by the GFC (like the AUD).

Regardless, the FDIC only covers certain types of deposits and only up to $250 000 per depositor. It's also not a hedge mechanism for the banks, because it only insures the depositors, and not the bank itself. Indeed, if the FDIC thinks a bank is becoming undercapitalised and fails to take corrective action, it can revoke it's charter and close the bank while refunding the depositors.

Cyprus is a tiny island with a small tax base and one whose main industries was functioning as a lightly taxed offshore financial centre for Other Peoples Money. Places like that are always going to be at risk of the problems associated with capital flight. If you don't have a real domestic economic base, instead relying mostly on supplying financial services, it's going to be pretty easy for investors to yank the carpet right out from under you if they think you might be teetering. It takes literally centuries to build enough trust to become a Switzerland.

Banks start with initial capital like any other business. They can take out loans themselves or issue shares. I don't think you really know how banking actually works.


It's how *every* banking system has worked *ever*. If banks were waiting around for each loan to be repaid before they made another one they wouldn't make profit in a lifetime, and there would be no credit market to speak of.
As long as customers can get bitcoins over the counter while the bank still has the faith of its depositors this will happen. There is nothing special about bitcoin that prevents it, other than a bank run, and thats been a risk in every currency.

It's not related to volume. It's related to the purposes of the transaction.


If you run an exchange that derives it's profit from mediating the trades of others, you are a money transmitter. If you are purchasing bitcoins for your own use, you are not.

Bonds are a function of the credit market. The money you spend on bonds is spent by the issuer, and recirculated back into the economy. You have in turn assumed a non-zero default risk (which is key), compensated by an interest rate that is hopefully commensurate with that risk. 
This is entirely different to not letting your currency touch the market at all.

You can't have credit markets without debt, and credit is an important function of any economy. Governments issue debt via bonds to smooth out interruptions and fluctuations in the cash flow from it's tax base, which is necessary to do because many things require ongoing and long-term stable investment. Govt debt in the USA is fucking heinous right now, but really this is an argument against irresponsible leadership, not govt debt itself.

Customers are purchasing the goods in person, and they already have access to an anonymous medium of exchange -cash. What specific advantages are there for them to use bitcoins, other than convenience to the business? The vast majority of people now and in the foreseeable future are going to continue to use cash for transactions like this because cash is readily available and businesses are going to continue to accept it to remain competitive, therefore the secure transportation of cash is going to be an ongoing issue.

Well, they have inside information regarding the timing of the trades, and their bots are much better situated to pick up the other end than anyone else is. Theoretically there is nothing stopping somebody else from picking up the other side of the trades, but that is not the practical reality of the situation.


No, but these kind of bot attacks are deliberately aimed at setting off cascading automatic stop loss orders and the like, too. Also, regardless of whether or not I engage in buying or selling during directly during manipulation, these actions still affect the value of anybody who owns bitcoin, make the market volatile and not to mention make it a pain in the fucking ass for the market to achieve proper price-discovery.


Which is why the exchanges probably don't go out of their way to crack down on these assholes.


Market manipulation is defined by making transactions intended to create or maintain an artificial price of any transferrable security. Whatever particular novel strategies are designed to achieve such an outcome doesn't particularly matter from a legal perspective.

How so? Fiat money can be described as money without intrinsic value. This is a widely held definition, and extensively sourced.

Roulette is a good example. Imagine there are no table limits, and you are just betting on red or black. A martingale strategy is to double your bet each time you lose, so (theoretically) after a while a win comes up, recouping all your losses plus winning the initial bet.
It's a fallacy because there are two green numbers (or 1% house edge in bitcoin casino), meaning there is always a small but constant chance of losing irrespective of red/black. Also, since doubling your bet on each loss is exponential, after a few losses it's unlikely you will have the bankroll to keep upping the bets.
It's a gambling 'system' that like many others, doesn't actually work.

I agree with you, but many of these are not really as easily dilineated as 'tech' triumphing over 'politics.'


Initial telecom networks required massive(!) investment with little hope of ROI on a timescale that did not make it competitive for private investment. The global telecom network was almost completely built by government monopolies, which had the capacity to rip up streets and lay copper while absorbing this massive one-off cost. In the 80's and 90's many of these govt monopolies were broken up and sold off, giving us the marketplace we have now. My point is it's not accurate to say that skype provides 'free' telecommunication, because it's really just software built on an infrastructure that cost a shitload to build, initially by governments.


Most demographic estimates place education level as the highest factor in determining birthrate. Women get jobs = less kids. Although I will concede that birth control has a significant role in this.


The internet is fucking amazing, and it has eroded class barriers to learning, but it's a little presumptuous to suggest most societies were not championing similar goals before the internet. Public libraries and govt funded education are two examples.

Setting aside the fact that this is assumption is itself utterly wrong (unless cartels want their money to be laundered over a *millennia* that fails to even outpace inflation) the entirety of all bitcoin transactions throughout its very existence wouldn't even be enough to hide more than a trivial amount of cartel profits. Also such an infusion of transactions by their volume and/or structuring would be immediately seen in the block chain, but they haven't. You have no grounds to make these kinds of claims.


Yes it does, and yes it *is.* Seizures, investigations into money-laundering activity and previous organised crime cases have demonstrated this time and again. It's much more effective to launder money via businesses, trusts and regulatory havens than pushing it all through the what... 3 major bitcoin exchanges? Then that money effectively needs to be laundered *again* to conceal it all coming from a bitcoin exchange with no further explanation as to its origin.

How does the bitcoin rise in value in this scenario? Gains in bit coin can only be relative, not absolute. A person purchasing the chair trades the immediate utility of the chair for the future appreciation of their bit coin, and thus has a disincentive to do so. I'm not saying trade won't happen, I'm saying it slows as a consequence. Wealth *is* created when people participate in economic activity, it's just that currencies like bitcoin if used in isolation inhibit this, and make it less worthwhile. Investment dries up, interest rates rise to incredibly high levels etc, real wealth shrinks.


Really? When wealth was tied to specie, scarcity dictated that the only the only way economies could grow was to aggressively expand into other markets, by war if necessary. Trade was not about mutual exchange, it could only be about maintaining positive terms of trade in one in one direction. Since mercantilism was the dominant discourse in most european nations during this period, nations would literally come into hot war when battling for access to new markets.
In other words, they were using gold, which is deflationary. In order to prevent a deflationary spiral, they were forced into conquest in order to keep up a supply of foreign gold to grow their domestic economies. The same thing happened that essentially killed the Roman empire, toward the end their only way of achieving growth was through conquest.


Economists are not people making bank in the financial sector. Economists are largely academics, and economics itself is just the study of the production of distribution and goods.

Well, you can say Govt issued fiat has intrinsic value too, since it's backed by the productive capacity and credit of the population residing in the nation state.

That doesn't mean they have no value, it just means they have no value other than as a store of value for stuff that *has* value.

It's a partial solution, but it still doesn't solve the cash security problem.

They most likely are going to have to hold onto the cash overnight, which is exactly what most businesses are seeking to avoid when banking at each close of business. In essence, you are proposing that the dispensaries *become* banks, which is tough security wise and also opens a whole new regulatory can of worms.

Given that some form of banking has existed since 2000 BC, yes it is very much a solved problem and the answer is INTEREST. 
You think Cyprus is going to end banking as an institution, or that it's the first time banks have faced a liquidity crisis? People are still going to continue to make cost/benefit analyses on where they warehouse their money, and if a bank can offer them a competitive interest rate, history says they will park their funds there. It might be higher for bitcoin funds than for fiat cash, but as Machiavelli said, 'every man has his price' and that price is where the market will operate.
The cypress deposits were insured anyway, and are currently being honoured. You're not really addressing any of my central points by throwing that out there, either.

You act like it 'does no harm' but it directly affects the purchasing power of every bitcoin user. If the only person it affected was just a few traders it probably wouldn't be such a big deal.

This is kind of part of the problem. You have wedded bitcoin to a particular ideology, and subsequently made the two inseparable.

Bitcoin is a tool with many advantages, but it's nonetheless a *tool* and making moral judgements based on it's adoption is probably unhelpful.


That's a reason to be LESS defensive, not more. If existing systems suck so much, then bitcoins success in the market is completely assured. The problem you have, I think, is that not everything agrees with your value judgement that things suck as much as you think they do.

* Fiat money has been defined variously as:any money declared by a government to be legal tender.[1]
state-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.
[2]money without intrinsic value.[3][4]
The term derives from the Latin fiat ("let it be done", "it shall be").[5]*

It bails out anybody without enough wealth to have a better risk-management strategy, like a diverse basket of investments.
None of this makes bitcoin an any better of flight-to-safety asset though! Any major market activity is accompanied by big swings. Not only is it illiquid, it's really volatile. Perhaps someday it might not be, but that time is *not now*


Or they could crash again. Who knows. There are any number of investments with a demonstrably better risk profile. There is no reason to choose bitcoin over them in the short term.

This is caused because of the limited liquidity in the bitcoin market currently. That situation will probably improve, but perhaps not for quite a while. That doesn't make it any less problematic, unethical or more easy to tolerate.


It absolutely does not. Ignoring that it equally affects prices off the exchange too, longer term price manipulations have been evident as well. 


I don't want to have to 'withhold my bitcoins' to buy something because somebody is pulling a pump and dump. There seems to be a troubling tendency to gloss over real issues here.


Unless your foresight is as good as your hindsight, no. The whole point of these schemes is taking advantage of information not available to the rest of the market, like the fact certain trades on the exchange are no longer real. *Sometimes* people can identify these patterns afterward... We have been luckybecause the schemes have been relatively unsophisticated so far. But then again, they were still quite successful because bitcoin is a pretty unsophisticated market.


I just said market failure is almost always a product of market participants lacking access to proper information. Which is true, and it's why markets correct rapidly in horribly unpleasant ways when that information finally comes out. This is not any less true for the housing crisis, regardless of who you want to blame. 


No, it can just be controlled by groups of people who own enough of it and are prepared to collude and co-ordinate their trading behaviour.
Perhaps this will change when enough new people own it, but at the moment, who knows when or if that is going happen? One things for sure though, it's to nobodies advantage that the markets are behaving so squiffy.

It depends on whether or not that cash represented income, and where you are domiciled for income tax purposes. It's basically a way of trying to prevent tax evasion / money laundering.

Well, like I said, the technology to secure it has become significantly more expensive and specialised, and as a result, centralised. The 'difficulty' of bitcoin is no longer in and of itself, an accurate measure of how secure it is. 
Right now there exists mining pools that could already double spend if they were hacked. In future, power demands and the network difficulty are going to edge out all but the most efficient institutional operators operating with the lowest power demands and cheapest access to electricity. "Securing" the network is increasingly less decentralised as time goes on by big players with access to proprietary technology. That is not a good thing.

It's going to be a tricky issue. Cash, even as electronic and fungible as it is, is still generally seen as having some sort of geographical locus for legislative purposes.

The advantages of FRB is the interest rate you receive on your deposits, created by the real demand for credit in the financial system. With bitcoin being more competitive as a transaction medium, it's going to force banks in turn to offer more advantages to deposit bitcoins with them.

Assuming your friend wanted to keep it in bitcoin. Otherwise, he has to sign up to some exchange, get verified, sell the coins (probably for a different dollar value than you agreed on), have a sales commission deducted, get it sent to his bank account (likely involving another fee), and then wait a highly variant ammount of time for the funds to arrive. 
Or he can find some one in person to sell these too, which involves tracking somebody down, leaving the house, meeting a stranger and possibly getting scammed.

Well... Fair enough if you are hoarding for the apocalypse or whatever, far be it for me to tell you any different. However, my point is that a currency whose value is primarily driven by the scarcity of hoarding rather than it's use as a medium of exchange is one that is illiquid and prone to serious volatility. In other words, encouraging a strategy like yours among others actually undermines the very properties of bitcoin that you are attempting to take advantage of.


Well, to be honest, most people do not save this way. Most people save via in a diversified mix of investments that allows them to grow their funds. 
The problem with your situation is that bitcoin is essentially zero-sum when it comes to value. Like any currency swap, each transaction in or out of the bitcoin system has a 'winner' and a 'loser.' 
You are hoping that the value of bitcoin is going to increase in the future, or at the very least remain static, so it represents a stable and inflation hedged store of your money. The problem with this is that means any gains you eventually realise must come at the expense of those purchasing bitcoin later than you did. Zero-sum markets are risky, especially to market participants without access to the best or up to date information. This is essentially why there are so many dodgy places on the internet selling access to FOREX trading platforms for cheap. They are harvesting suckers, skimming money from the bid/ask spread or even just taking the opposite side of their customers trades.
This is different to say, investing in the equity of a company and participating in a share of their profit via a dividend. It represents an *absolute gain* whereby profits are not the result of another market participants losses.

Paying off debt is a *garunteed* cost benefit. In one moment, you have instantly made a return equal to all the interest that would have had to pay over the entire life of your loan. 
This is opposed to a speculative investment that might be worth more one day, with a significant risk that it might not. You have no picture of what time scale it's going to appreciate over, and by how much. Worse still, you could potentially lose all sunk costs.

Any US bitcoin exchange has to be registered as a money transmitting service, and is not exempt from the same FinCEN reporting requirements that apply to banks performing a similar service.

No they are not...
Bitcoin (or any currency) does not create wealth. It's solely a medium of exchange, hence it pays no returns. *Investments* create wealth, like businesses, or shares in businesses etc. The problem with bitcoin is there is only a finite and small amount of it in circulation as defined by the protocol, so it will become increasingly scarce if it becomes more widely used. This puts it into a deflationary spiral which discourages its spending because the benefits of hoarding it outweigh the benefits of investing it. When investment slows, the economy shrinks, capital flows decrease and real wealth shrinks with it.
This is why modest targeted inflation rates are generally good for the economy, because they encourage the investment of capital into ventures rather than passively hanging on to it.

The same way they do it with cash? They keep an internal ledger of peoples gold holdings, and as long as there is not a run and they can maintain liquidity, there is no problem. Banks can have reciprocal arrangements with one another and exchange 'gold' with each other and their clients accounts.

Since that PH is now reliant on expensive single-use hardware that favours established manufacturers and is increasingly edging out meaningful participation by consumers (barely any of it makes monetary sense on a retail basis) it's arguable that the difficulty is actually making bitcoin less secure than some of it's competitors.

My point was that speculating on (any) currency swap represents a zero sum market interaction. For every gain you make, somebody else by necessity has to be on the losing side. No wealth is created in this way, no economic growth is achieved. This is different to say, offering a loan to start a business or investing in a stake of a profit generating enterprise. This is what increases growth and it's attendant benefits.


I'm very much aware of this, semantics aside. My point was that under the system of global central banks and targeted inflation rates, fiat cash is not seen as either an investment or productive commodity. It's a relatively stable mechanism of exchange backed by the productive capacity of those working in it's issuing nation-state.


This is a complete fallacy. There is no such thing as gold having 'static' value, unless you can prove that a fixed amount of gold has had the same purchasing power parity with a set of identical goods throughout all of history, and your '1000 years' assertion aside, you can't. This gets repeated far to often.
In addition claiming that gold has static value and that all financial activity fluctuates relative to it is basically a useless and fallacious truism. I could say the same about almost anything, from bronze, eggs, bread or iron ore.


I know exactly what intrinsic means. Bitcoin is a currency, but since it is artificially scarce, it cannot support economic expansion on its own. It requires convertibility with a larger non deflationary source of fiat in order to work as a mechanism of exchange. Essentially, bitcoin will function as an anonymous free paypal, a clearinghouse for existing fiat exchange that people wish to use to evade the cost or regulatory capture involved in certain fiat exchanges. Not much more. Even the vendors that accept bitcoin overwhelmingly have their prices in bitcoin pegged to fiat values.


It's not relevant to this conversation perhaps, but it is relevant when discussing the views of some people whom seem to be ideologically hostile to the notion of fractional reserve banking and fiat currency in general, and view bitcoin as some sort of 'answer' to this. It's not.
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:09:55


Gains or losses are only realised once the bitcoins are spent or exchanged, and at that point of exchange, if you get more for your bitcoins than you spent on them, then you are the winner and the other dude is the loser. Nothing has been created or lost, just an extant amount of finite value has passed in greater proportion to you.
The problem is, you shouldn't be hanging on to money just hoping its going to appreciate. You should be putting it to work by investing in enterprises for a profit to grow the economy and realise both greater personal and shared gains that way.


No, contrary to expectation, we are living in a time of greater abundance than ever before. Want to know what happens when we rely on a deflationary currency? We've already seen it:
The only way to expand one's economy and prevent a deflationary spiral is through conquest and empire. Dutch East India Company, colonialism, etc... Take the world and force them to trade with you on your terms. This is why the Brits literally had a war with China to force them to import their opium.
Trust me, sucky as it may seem sometimes, free trade has produced a much better outcome.

The problem is that the BFL would have never have offered payment via an escrow service, so it literally solves nothing in this situation.

Their whole 'pre-order' business model involved raising capital via pre-orders to spend implementing their product, and that's why they are welching on the refunds.
No escrow service would have stopped this situation. People willingly invested in risky vapourware and got burned.

Without accurate price discovery mechanisms, supply and demand becomes difficult to assess. On an asset as thinly traded as bitcoin, this can become a serious problem.

The lack of a 10 minute lag to confirm each transaction would be a big plus. Do you usually wait around for 10 minutes every time you want to buy something at a shop? Perhaps a higher ultimate currency limit, too? at some point, transacting ever decreasing fractions of bitcoin is going to represent a pain in the ass with all the leading zeroes.
Perhaps also based on a crypto that is difficult to build ASIC's for and relies more on consumer hardware?
These features I'm talking about (and more) are already being factored into new cryptocurrencies that are being traded right now. My point is who knows what the future holds? There is nothing super magical about bitcoin that means it can't be superseded and replaced with something else.

Inflation doesn't affect the poor *more* than deflation does. It just affects the poor more than the rich because *every* fluctuation affects the poor more than the rich. 
Inflation makes goods more expensive to purchase on a small fixed wage. *Deflation* on the other hand just makes you *unemployed* as your utility drops relative to the expense required to pay you. Poor people on low wages always get shed first. 
Rich people have to invest capital goods and loan money to resist inflation, creating economic activity and increased money velocity... They have to *take risks to preserve their value*. In a deflationary economy, they have to do fuck all. *Literally nothing* except sit on their wealth and become an entrenched generational, useless moneyed class that profits from the risks taken by others to expand the economy, and by consequence their wealth. 
As for bitcoin freeing us from some kind of entrenched oligarchy, that's even more hilarious. Most of the bitcoins that *exist* today lie in the hands of a tiny few who got in early. It's got to be the most rediculous disparity ever seen.

Um, how can you even remotely arrive at this conclusion? Bitcoin can coexist with any number of other currencies. It is right now. This is a silly assumption to make, and one not borne out by really *any* evidence. Why would you assume there are only these *two* outcomes possible? 
In any case, it has literally *nothing* to do with *anything* i've been talking about.


No, I won't actually. I think that's a problem you are failing at understanding. Economics is not hostile to the concept of bitcoin, nor does it represent something radically new in economic theory.

The problem is, there is no return on those investments. The upfront price dwarfs their expected profitability. The market remains willing to pay for these essentially losing devices at high prices, which is troubling to this blog writer, because it essentially validates his central point that the market surrounding bitcoin is irrational right now. You don't spend money mining gold out of the ground for more than it's market price unless you are a hobbyist who is doing it for reasons beyond profit, or somebody who likes throwing away money.
Most investment instruments sold by companies who value time over longterm return are purchased with the general expectation that their value appreciates over time. A bond is a good example of this, or a share in a growing company.
Mining hardware is the opposite. It's return is declining on an exponential basis every day you hang on to it. It's a suckers game, and the only people making cash from it are the manufacturers and retailers.

I think you will find that 'stealing' is illegal in every single jurisdiction that has laws. The fact that you do it across international boundaries doesn't make it any less illegal.
Even setting that aside, it's a moronic fallacy to assume that laws dictate ethical behaviour, rather than the other way around. Stealing is illegal *because* it's immoral, and universally defined as such. The fact you *can* do something has nothing the fuck to do with whether you *should.*
How is this not completely obvious to you?
@_date: 2013-09-01 14:28:05
No, that's not why they think it's deflationary. It's deflationary because there is a fixed supply of currency and the cost of goods in bitcoins will continue to decline as the economy grows, rather than say remaining stable or increasing as is the case with inflation.
It's got nothing to do with 'running out' of anything. It's just a simple fact of economic growth + fixed monetary supply = increased value of units of that currency.

I highlighted a problem with price stability due to manipulation, which harms price-discovery and it's utility as a transactional currency. Your response was to not use bitcoin. If that isn't glossing over an issue, I'm not sure what constitutes one.


I was using it in a plainly general sense to a wholly *different* persons response. There is also plenty of examples of price manipulation, fraudulent loans and various nasty behaviour in the housing crisis. My point was also one that said when market information is witheld from participants, market failures occur. *This is not a controversial viewpoint.*


I have a hard time understanding this concept of voluntary consent when deception is involved. 


Pretty sure I haven't said a *thing* about bots needing regulation. These strategies are *already* illegal, the people that carry them out do them entirely at their own risk.


Again, with the glib and rediculous strawmen. 
You keep saying 'bot trading' as if this is anything to do with painting the tape. If you can't see how this is deliberate act to mislead and deceive the market to extract value, and don't particularly understand why this is unethical behaviour, I guess we part company on the basic reasoning.

If your point is that the future is simply unknowable, then that's not really a point at all.

'Walls' have nothing to do with this.


So you want to drive people away from bitcoin and harm it's utility as a transactional currency just for the sake of not being able to admit something might be a problem?


How do you fail to see this. The definition of 'painting the tape' is investors taking both ends of the trade, essentially trading with nobody but themselves, to manipulate the price. This information that they are trading with themselves, and the trades are not real, is why the strategy is effective. *That* is the information being withheld from the market, and it's basically a *truism* that this affects market efficiency and functioning. Since the order-book is anonymous, it's difficult to uncover. The use of 'bots' is only relevant in that it makes this behaviour easier to achieve through the use of software tools. I'm not sure you even know what I am getting at here.


No. Just... No. The whole point of trading with YOURSELF is that you can manipulate the stated price if liquidity is low enough.

I don't think you could term bitcoin a flight-to-safety asset yet. Perhaps someday given it's design, but sure as fuck not at the moment.

I'd be interested in this too. Assuming AUD is not gunked up at GOX, it's a pretty big arbitrage opportunity.
As for Aussie exchanges, coinjar.io right now is the dogs bollocks. They let you link a bank acct and provide BTC sales with only 1% commission. They derive their spot price from a bunch of different exchanges, not just GOX, so you will still take a price hit here if you are shuttling money out of GOX. However, I've used them several times and can vouch for their reliability.

Wow, there are misguided statements and then there are ones like this. The much lower market cap of bitcoin *alone* makes it easier to move, and if you haven't seen some of the blatant bot related price manipulation on some of the major BTC exchanges recently, you can only be wilfully naive.
The only reason bitcoin didn't move significantly on this news is not because its beyond their ability to manipulate, it only means *they aren't bothering to.*
@_date: 2013-08-25 08:06:58


Then it's just semantic wanking. Bitcoin may not be able to be 'counterfeit' in the relatively narrow way we understand it as it pertains to traditional currencies, but it may be vulnerable in ways we don't currently recognise that lead to similar functional outcomes. This whole post just seems like you want somebody to pat you on the head and reassure you about how right you are, rather than an effort to examine and discuss the broad security benefits *and* challenges that could face bitcoin.

Well, the government backing a currency provides it with 'intrinsic' value like the bitcoin network does too. It backs the currency with the productive capacity and credit of the population. 
In reality, these are not 'intrinsic' values outside the context of money. So government issued currency and bitcoin are both fiat. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 23:30:32
However bitcoins already have opportunity/market costs and risks associated with converting from cash. You can't do it with most traditional payment methods due to the risk of chargeback. It has to be done either at an online exchange using your bank account -with a trade commission attached- or in person with somebody else which is a pain in the ass in most contexts. 
And for what? Bitcoins won't save a business significant money on their cash security costs unless it represents such an overwhelming share of their business, that it obviates the need for cash pickup at all.
This bitcoin argument relies on so many leaps of faith, that it doesn't actually represent the realities of running a small business at all. Bitcoin has great utility right now for long distance transactions of money, and secure pseudo-anonymous online transactions, it just doesn't have the same advantages when compared to cash for small physical in person transactions. Even other cashless convenience solutions with wide acceptance like debit/credit cards have yet to take over this space in a manner that has obviated the need for cash security measures.

In other words, you shifted all your business risk onto your customers and away from yourselves. Customers aren't investors hedging risk, they just want a product you agreed to deliver. Find some actual investment capital, like a loan or something. Don't use your customers cash to speculate. 
This is the same crap that BFL did. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 09:06:22
Is your argument literally that since *fiat* had a different contextual definition 1000 years ago, all modern consensus based uses of this word, later adopted by economists to describe certain agreed on phenomena are wrong now? 
This is the kind of rediculous reductive argument whose relevance to any current usage is strained at best. 
Your vitriol is also completely unessesary, and not a compliment to your argument.  I look forward to you editing a top comment in your usual, revisionist and dramatic style, however.

My point is, newly minted coins are 'clean' in that they don't have a history. You could be handling all sorts of dirty money, and people selling on localbitcoins might have more than a purely philosophical desire to remain anonymous too...

Having a real hard time finding realistic lending terms on that site, and no wonder... How do you calculate a 1yr interest rate when the currency has appreciated in value almost 20% in little over a week??
A pawnshop delivers *much* better market rates than that place does right now. 12% over 30 days? That was one of the better offers... Holy shit. Also, those prices were pegged to *bitcoins* which means almost every single lender has *lost* money on their positions thus far even at those massively steep high risk rates.
There are definitely ways to go, and I don't know why the guy who initially commented was down-voted for pointing out something unambiguously true.

These are not 'returns.' Returns are dividends or interest payments on securities such stocks or bonds. In the case of stock, you share in a quarterly proportion of the companies profits relative to the number of shares you own, in the case of bonds, you are entitled to predefined interest payments for the life of the bond until it reaches maturity and you are refunded the principal.
"Buying low &amp; Selling High" is not investment, it is speculation. It represents a zero sum market game. In order for you to make a profit 'selling high' another market participant(s) must lose out in equal proportion. No net value is created.


Due to it's finite nature, it's actually more like a commodity. The more participants that use it, the higher it's value will go, until it's largely becomes used as a static store of value, like gold, due to the fact that increasing value discourages it's spending. It may end up as an adjunct to fiat currencies, or as a hawala like transfer mechanism... However I doubt it will supplant currencies for most transactions. For this reason, bitcoin is not a replacement for fiat, it's intrinsically reliant on it. 
If the fiat currencies of the world crashed tomorrow, bitcoin would crater in with them as well.

He's making basically a blockchain.info browser plugin with an edgy name, and asking for money to do it. Of all the excellent bitcoin opensource projects out there this looks like hype vehicle. 
This guy is only ever a hype man. I could make a better and less likely to explode firearm in five minutes with a nail and some plumbing fittings from any hardware store. Your opinion may differ, but I find this guy an insufferable git who pushes controversy over rational discourse in an endlessly tiresome fashion.

That's a complicated deal that takes time, lawyers to structure and actual investor due-dilligence to set up.
BFL was in a sellers market, offering a first taste of a hot product designed to *literally print money.* It set the terms, and there were more than enough suckers willing to get in line and risk taking them at their word.
People are bad at evaluating risk, but they really wanted in on the inside track. The rest, as they say, is history.

The problem is the transaction protocol is easily replicated, and in fact has been in the form of the myriad altcoins.
At the moment, there is nothing particularly intrinsic to bitcoin that ensures it's value. Not that you can't say that about anything, really, but bitcoin is fiat in the manner that there is nothing really stopping a 'better' bitcoin coming along. Perhaps one that has a blockchain that is opaque to observers, but still verifiable cryptographically, for example. A true anonymous currency.
@_date: 2013-08-19 09:24:29
My point is that it shouldn't be regarded as a growth investment, because it's supposed to be a medium of exchange. The more people hoard their coins hoping for a big payoff one day, the less utility bitcoin has as a whole.
I'm not saying you should just piss your bitcoins away, but you should consider investing them in things if you are after growth.
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:38:20
No, the fact that it's being used as an alternative to existing fiat currencies is not an argument that it is not fiat itself. The USD is frequently used in similar contexts, and taken instead of the local currency. That doesn't make it not fiat. 
Bitcoin, like Govt backed fiat has no utility separate from its contextual use as money. That's the long and short of it, and why it possesses no intrinsic value.

Escrow is not going to help you in a 'pre-order' situation, since the whole point is for the business to get your cash up front while not immediately shipping product. It's a method to raise capital, while offloading business risk onto customers.
If you agree to a pre-order of something as risky as hardware that as yet doesn't even exist... Well, not sure what to tell you. I'm not excusing BFL's actions, which quite possibly were misleading and deceptive, but they were deliberately offering it's customers the attractive return of being potentially among the first ASIC miners on the scene, at the risk of putting their money up front. People judged the risk to be worth it, and paid up on vapourware. They were wrong. All investments have a risk profile, and anyone could see this one was high as fuck. If people wanted to be patient, they could have waited until shit was on the shelves. They didn't, because of the irrational goldrush mentality.
Asking somebody to bail you out of your risky investments, especially with all the 'rugged individualism' bullshit in this forum seems a bit rich in hindsight.

He's offering advice on how to run a bitcoin exchange in compliance to safeguard clients money. Regardless of how you feel about the situation, if you don't adhere to this you will get you shit seized which will fuck over your customers just like GOX is now. They could have avoided this whole situation they are in at the moment if they just hired a few fucking lawyers, but no, I guess they wanted to cultivate an attitude like yours.
You want to keep all your bitcoin transactions on the down-low, fine. However most people do want to have some way to get their money into bitcoins that isn't only achievable via meeting someone in person with a fistful of cash. The fact that people are running regulated and liquid exchanges is part of the reason why bitcoin is becoming successful. Your comment really, really, misses the point.
