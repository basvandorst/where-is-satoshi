Thinking we've 'solved' quantum speaks volumes, unfortunately, otherwise, entertaining op :)

you sound like you're surprised?
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:04:54
individualism at work, well done current brainwashing education system!
The trick you see, is not to "think outside the box"
The trick is "there is no box"
People SHOULD work together, its not only a Bitcoin vs Fiat war, but unfortunately businesses emerging in the Bitcoin world are also at each others throats, its disheartening and stupid.
10,000 people working together would do so much more than 5,000 people working alone and 5,000 wondering around lost.

Use another exchange .. [IBWT](
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:47:14
And what they are doing now is not illegal??
Holding funds, refusing withdrawals, allowing deposits and trading.. in almost any country it'd illegal to hold deposits and not allow withdrawals within a reasonable amount of time (24 hrs to 7 days normally)

mtgox is not bitcoin

way too early to tell, I'm a believer in altcoins, but I still think Bitcoin will be the foundation and will continue for quite some time (it by far has a better infrastructure behind it).
either way, as always, loving the ride :)

@_date: 2014-02-23 18:54:28
that is quite cool

I think you're over reacting, he just said that he found particular thing funny
@_date: 2014-02-03 13:02:25
urm.. maybe because the less stupid of us know where they come from, lol
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:29:30
ye, i hear fiats used for those naughty bad things also! lets close everyones account that has fiat, quickly! so glad people like you are in charge!
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:13:55
theoretically possible, technically close to impossible (due to only having 1 shot at it), financially suicide, and to just reverse/double your own transactions whilst you very briefly held 51%  (which would then be worthless).
You'd need a fortune to do it, you'd need a fortune of Bitcoin to make it worth it, and doing it would destroy the value of the coin you held and all the equipment you brought to do it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:37:35
like how fiat collapsed world wide after each credit card heist and each bank robbery? oh wait.. is that some fiat still in my pocket? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:11:19
Lol, wrong again, it must be painful being you :D
What you are referring to is called 'Universal Decay', in the knowledge that everything decays.
But .. this is a misdemeanor (you dumbass), what it in fact means is that everything in space/time will degenerate. But maths and numbers are **not** in space/time.
They are somewhere else, let us just say that they exist within imagination, and numbers exist infinatas (forevermore). Beyond the concepts of space/time, and Bitcoin exists within maths and numbers which will exist for infinity.
So, child, whilst we sit in the kindergarten together, if it doesn't make your brain squeek too much, try to think of what I have just said. 
Try to understand the concepts of maths, numbers, universal decay, infinity, Bitcoin.
Now, Fiat, that one is piss easy to understand.
But you're clearly not bright enough to understand what numbers are, so ye, good luck! 
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:36:27
Exactly ... dur .. if a bank, credit union, or credit card agency (or similar) collapses, or gets a bailout, you don't see people going "amagad! I will never use fiat again!1!"
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:59:08
unfortunately the community also downvoted some exchanges trying to say they were not affected and jumped on the "amagad, mtgox is broken, therefore bitcoin broken!1!" bandwagon
people here love the hype and prefer bad news than good, and then there's the ones purposefully trying to use opportunities like this to crash the market
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:43:45
Clearly I know a lot more than you.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:08:01
ye, I hear ya bro :/
@_date: 2014-02-19 11:36:55
rofl, I had to re-read the gox announcement then, but hilarious :D

existence. We just turned a corner apparently.
Welcome to the interwebz!
Seriously though, I've been threaten fuck loads of times over the years by scammers, they can go fk themselves, if I ever saw one up front after they threatened me, they'd learn the meaning of pain.
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:31:23
I once got fiat (euro) out of gox! admittedly about 7 months ago and I'd never try again, but it worked :D
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:25:02
you must have trouble tying your shoe-laces in the morning huh? or you keep them tied their too difficult?


Riiiiight .. thats why you think everything degrades, stupid much? Numbers don't cease to exist you moron .. lol, seriously, you're trying to argue with me and you say something as stupid as that :D:D:D
what happened to saying they failed? I thought **everything** failed, as you said, so now they dont 'fail', they just cease to exist? even if that was correct (which its not, the laws of physics and quantum don't cease to be because our race dies out, the earth moves).
oh dear, just no point really, you're obviously a delinquent and need 'special' help. And you think if the human race died numbers would cease to exist??? lololololol
just like .. lol... i'm laughing too much right now, just, hahahahaha. 


The laws of physics would probably still give a shit, hahahahahahaha, go sit in a corner, there there, lols *pat*

Fiat has a 100% failure rate. No fiat currency has EVER survived.
You sir are either;
1. a troll
2. stupid
3. misinformed
4. purposefully being stupid
5. all of the above
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:45:41
Logic dictates its gox
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:12:40
its probably very true.


I hear ya bro, their end is coming
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:00:49


most people don't understand this..
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:33:50
Flawed logic IS the main reason people stay with fiat.
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:57:05
search for the user '0123a' you can see it on that persons history 
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:12:12
'Bitcoin game'? lol? Did you used to say 'I will never use the internet', or you've never emailed anyone? Do you fear getting into a car also?
@_date: 2014-02-09 14:54:30
or move to altcoins, whilst keeping Bitcoin as prime (its going to be an interesting debate in the future, like, far future)
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:29:00
is it still a conspiracy when its probably very true?
1. allow deposits but no withdrawals
2. lock people in so they panic trade (lotsa commission fees)
3. buy up everyone elses btc when they panic sell
4. profit huge and cover your btc losses due to stupidness
@_date: 2014-02-22 10:18:04
hahahaha, brilliant op :D
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:44:55
the fiat side, holding deposits without releasing them when requested by the account holder.
and ye, you're right, the crypto side doesn't come under any laws, yet.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:12:30
is that chart relative to the number of transactions or the amount transacted?
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:17:18
Exactly, its a hell of lot more. If you think its a 'Bitcoin game' and that you will never have any, then you are mistaken sir.
Unless of course you plan to keel over and pass away within the next 5 years, otherwise it will be integral to everyones life, more than fiat is today.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:23:34
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:37:18
im upvoting you everywhere op, as others are retarded and downvoting you for a very valid (and funny) post
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:38:45
You sir are very correct
@_date: 2014-05-26 19:32:07
ibwt.co.uk, just doesn't get used much
@_date: 2013-10-29 13:03:22
Must agree. You would still pay transfer fees, and exchange rates, etc, etc

might want to link it there

copy an (bitcoin) address or qr code onto your wordpress site. Problem is, that people would need to get bitcoin first, which you should also explain the easiest ways for them (in Aussieland) for your guests.
@_date: 2013-10-29 13:12:04
It does get randomly plugged (but not by the IBWT people all the time). And they removed all orders because of the bank notice (
As a note, they're undergoing changes to allow alternative funding ( and check their FAQ and ToS pages) and basically removing most of verification required.
Whilst still keeping it within the UK (for no transfer or exchange fees).
Probably a couple of weeks before they're operational again.
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:39:46
totally :D
Anyone remember what happened during alcohol prohibition with all the 'wealth' of the 'prohibited' sitting there for anyone (FBI) to grab (and then run off with for themselves).
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:37:41
it happens, don't worry (has happened to me and others also), I've a feeling they need to re-fill their hot wallet from time to time. Just be patient and try withdrawing every so often.
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:19:55
shhh ..
what you're talking about is the replacement of the banking system, y'see, the bitcoin protocol isn't just about replacing fiat, its about replacing the entire banking system
@_date: 2013-10-29 17:33:48
shh, sneak preview (alternative funding with lower verification incoming) -
