Blockchain technology will change the world, it will become the default means of doing transactions and it will be the catalyst to a more open and transparent internet.
If you believe that statement, price fluctuations shouldn't bother you, it's mere noise on the way to greatness.
And remember, unless you are actively trading, price fluctuations don't matter. Moreover, this is actually a good thing! It's the perfect time to convert paper into crypto!
Stop panicking, everyone. Just don't be dumb, don't throw away things you need in order to invest in bitcoin.
Everything will be fine.

Living in Berlin, I can tell you Bitcoin is a welcome change. Businesses have been waiting for this type of currency, they won't let it go so easily, especially since it's made a physical impact on their lives. And they the things I hear about the third world benefit from such tiny transaction costs... they'll accept this with more open arms than Berlin. It's beautiful.
That's what gives me confidence.

I think Mt.Gox handled the situation professionally enough for an exchange only a few years old in an infant market that is Bitcoin and I have a problem with hypocrites on Ignore the next sentence if you're not one of them.
*Dear hypocrites, I really have a problem when you expect responsibility from the action of others when you yourself are irresponsible with your words, especially since a popular post on Reddit spreading misinformation seen by thousands could have just as much impact as a poorly worded statement from some employee at an exchange*. 
I know it's much to ask but I think users should post responsibly. Spreading misinformation (purely based on postulation) is bad for the Bitcoin community. I know is an outlet for discontent, but I wish it weren't. 
This subreddit is a big baby and growing up fast. Maybe it's time to sit down and have a talk about responsibility.

Here are my thoughts (not worth many bitcoins at the moment).
There are also huge discrepancies in price between exchanges right now. 
Mt.Gox, not surprisingly, is at 343€.
BTC-E is at 442€.
Kraken is at 467€.
Predictable. This just shows that it's getting uncomfortable and people are having second, third and fourth thoughts.
I don't know by how much the price will go down tomorrow due to the silk road news, but if it's all in the hands of one group and they aren't reasonable enough to cash out in small bursts... the downward curve will get really bad by both direct actions and the resulting panic from other bitcoiners.
But there is hope! If you were thinking about getting into bitcoin and using it on a day to day basis, the next week is a good time to buy because the price will be double what it is now in a month.
So I remain optimistic, because bitcoin is a good idea and it is too engraved in the lives of real people to just die out. If you are new, buy and join the long game.

Thanks, I wrote a complaint there... but that probably won't amount to anything.

No, this is a fair warning... it was misunderstood.
"Creators of bitcoin" here does not refer to mythical Satoshis, but to any mining pool or exchange that gives you bitcoin for energy/money. The Lithuanian Central Bank is just telling you to be careful because they cannot help you if you get scammed by a mining pool or exchange. Their warning also advises you not to put all your money into one exchange and not to trust one pool. 
Something was lost in translation... and most of you were ready to jump on the bandwagon.

The only possible problem that could arise here would be when we develop some computing technology that can in fact generate all Bitcoin address private keys in a timely fashion. But if that happens (which it won't in the near future), all cryptocurrency addresses will be vulnerable.
If Bitcoin is around in ca. 40 years, the first person to do this would get pretty rich.

They will lose money at first, but remember that bitcoin is a wanted currency. Small businesses love the tiny transaction costs and the almost instantaneous transfers.
You should be telling your friends what the fundamental benefits of bitcoin are and how exceptionally low the exchange rate is right now. 
If buying low and selling high is the rule, this is good news for them.

@_date: 2014-02-24 09:21:03
I think both sides of the argument are getting ridiculous. It's speculation paradise over here when all we really know relating to this topic is that Mt.Gox deleted all their tweets.
But we can wait. If the next update (no matter the contents) is written professionally unlike in the past, theory holds some water.
I wish we had a man on the inside though... a Mt.Gox Snowden if you will...
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:31:20
The SEPA rules apply to the banks doing the transfer, not Kraken. So the moment you submit a withdrawal request to Kraken, it takes a few days *for Kraken*, not the bank, to process your request. The rule you are talking about applies to Kraken's bank the moment Kraken initializes the SEPA transfer.
So cross out that part of your argument.
Other than that, I hope you get your money soon. Good luck.
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:36:20
It might be that whoever is writing these updates seriously does not know how to sound reassuring.
Things like "some security problems" and "to keep everyone in the loop" and "deeply appreciate your kind understanding and 
continuous support" are not what you use in this kind of situation.
Even stating they are just paranoid is better than what they did. And instead of sugaring up the words, they could just apologize for not being transparent. And by assuming those that read this are giving them "continuous support" just makes them sound delusional.
And of course this shit gets approved because Mark Karpeles is a delusional person believing himself to be the next Bill Gates. This is my opinion and is based on reading [his reddit posts]( [his blog]( [twitter posts]( [Bitcoin Foundation description]( and all those interviews he does.


So to comment on your comment, I don't think so. Karpeles seriously thinks everything is fine and due to his awkward lack of social skills, every Mt.Gox update sounds like shit.
I don't think their finances, code or legal status is that big of a problem. Karpeles is just an incompetent asshole that claims to be a magical geek with all the answers. He's got issues and as long as he's in control (which he has to be because he's a control freak) the company is suffering. He needs to step down.

It was also in November, around the time Bitcoin jumped. I was sending a small "test-transaction" to see if it really would work with my bank. I just read the FAQ and it turns out it wasn't enough. I thought the minimum withdrawal was 2.50€... turns out it's 10€.
So I didn't send enough. :/

In order to build the asics, they need to have money they don't have. Easiest way to get it is for customers to pay for the product pre-release, but they also take out loans.
Selling the asics pays back the loans and they get a big profit margin... and like others have mentioned... they can earn some money on the side through so called testing.
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:26:38
What I got from this is that Mt.Gox is trying to be more forthcoming with developments and there will be an update on Monday.
Finding hidden meanings in the announcement only serves to misinform. Calling a company incompetent that  was once the biggest bitcoin exchange is disingenuous.
I don't think the Mt.Gox staff was suddenly replaced by monkeys and I don't think that were evil all along, so I would recommend you chill out you're not on Mt.Gox, buy cheap bitcoin if you are, and wait till Monday for the update.
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:46:13
Damn, they are bad at giving updates. Look at that price.

@_date: 2014-02-14 08:57:58
But look on the other side, someone is buying cheap bitcoin and you know Mt.Gox will be back in a few days. This is the perfect opportunity to buy ridiculously cheap and sell when it goes up.

Yeah... I have 100 EUR in there. I did everything in my power to get it back, even filed a report with the German police.

Well, I just suggested being less bothered by it, so in other words, to have more self-control. 
For example, we may be hard-wired for some things, but you decide how often you check the price of bitcoin. Some people definitely replaced (or even supplemented) paper money with crypto in this regard.
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:56:36
I think you're both wrong. Even in communist societies, it's all about the money, having more of it is seen as something better. It really is about dealing with scarcity in general and just how much you let it affect you psychologically... the only way for everyone to get out of this system would be for everyone to have Star Trek replicators. Since that's unlikely, personally and right now, you could just try to be less bothered about being affected by scarcity.

I think the concerns people have about the effects of cryptocurrency mining on the environment plays a role in the price drop. It is readily dismissed by enthusiasts as negligible, but it's never facts that affect the market, it's how those facts are perceived and it may be that a lot of people are turned off by the words "environmental impact". That Google ad really didn't help...  (puts on tin-foil hat) maybe Google is even tweaking Google searches.
So having bad press like this is not trivial.
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:50:54
We're still brainstorming but I think around 10 developers showed interest. There's still place for more developers to jump on. This is very experimental, so we'll keep it to about 16 at first.
The donations jar is just an idea we had. Before Bitcoin, it wasn't possible to have a donation jar with this level of simplicity and transparency. So it's a bonus.
But, the point has been raised that it would be unfair if donations were split evenly if someone put more work into the games than others. I want to try the first mix tape with an equal split of donations, with room for adjustment if everyone honestly agrees a participant didn't do a fair share of work. That's also why progress updates are so important.
That being said, I don't see a problem with people donating to specific developers as well. I mean, there is absolutely nothing stopping people from simply tipping the developer that is putting more work into the game than others. Heck, I encourage it... why not?
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:30:11
Good idea. I didn't know if donation is the right word. I don't know about the others, but it did leave me a bit uneasy because this is not something serious, it's just a game jam bonus for making something nice if people like it.
'Buy the game developer a coffee' has a good ring to it actually.
Or maybe just "tip the dev" ?
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:38:28
If our Mix Tape proves popular, we'll need extra security, so this is something that I will look into.
Right now, I'm worried that it'll be less secure through my own blunders with unfamiliar software. I mean, that's how most people lose their cryptocoins, through their own mistakes.
@_date: 2015-03-03 14:42:08
I would say litecoin is one of those coins this doesn't really apply to. I don't say it's better, but it's been holding up about as well as bitcoin.
But I guess it all depends on if you think cryptocurrencies are like Highlander or the Power Rangers.
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:02:20
[Here's the original post]( I made to over a week ago. It explains the concept.
Roughly summarized, we are experimenting with a way for devs to get tips through for doing the game jam if you like the free games they produce. You can also give them feedback to influence how the game comes out. This is the first Mix Tape is doing, so it is experimental. Feedback is also appreciated.

I'll have to think about it...
... along with another idea... since I live in student housing there are a lot of beer bottles around that could be recycled for a few Euro. Exchanging my earnings for bitcoins every month or so might be a good idea. It's a win for the environment and motivation for me to use bitcoin.

I think this is a good point, but doesn't really relate to the argument. If you worry about longevity, you'd probably just end up buying gold. But yes, Bitcoin will disappear if the internet disappears and it's hard to be so sure about the internet's longevity. It's a fairly new thing on the human scale.
For all practical purposes this doesn't matter because the Internet is probably permanent. It's a good point nonetheless because there are situations when you would rather use a currency that will be there in 100 years. You probably shouldn't leave your inheritance exclusively in Bitcoin just yet. If you use a currency that may also have longevity issues like the Euro, there will still be an authority to exchange your money if the EU disappears.
Like I said, it's something to consider, but doesn't add to the argument. I guess the new idea people have a hard time understanding is that the safety-net and "army" behind Bitcoin comes from intellectual power as opposed to military might.

A bit of a sensationalist title. I see the problem. Hvanra thought that the send address was also the deposit address:














On Mt.Gox, the send address is not the deposit address, so 1PZmRkTrBv8sSn1mgYtjeVwJLtxwUGEHr5 (an address Hvanra thinks is his) is not actually linked to Hvanra's account. The address linked to his account, as stated by the Mt.Gox representative, is under the funding options tab. 
Hvanra never stated where he got his deposit address from! Hopefully he realized his mistake now.

China wants to wean itself off the dollar and has been against using the dollar in international trade for a while now. They want to decrease transaction costs and not be affected by decisions made in the US.
Basically they are fighting against the attitude set by U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connally in 1971: "It's our currency and your problem".
So I figured they have to have some interest in Bitcoin. Maybe China isn't interested in *using* Bitcoin, but I think it's giving them some new ideas as to how they could solve their dollar problem. That's why I think they are certainly interested.

I'm not sure, but when buying a regular phone in Germany you have to leave some personal details at the store. However, purchasing a SIM card is very anonymous since you can get that pretty much anywhere for cash.
[Here's an article]( I found that talks about the ongoing fight here.
I'm just not sure if buying electronic equipment can ever be anonymous in the secure sense at any larger store or online. In Germany the best bet is to buy an unlocked phone from a small shady kiosk where there are no cameras and no contracts and to buy the SIM card with cash at another kiosk with no cameras. You don't need to sign anything for the SIM card.
I just can't believe the US wouldn't have some sort of monitoring system that efficiently identifies the caller. It seems to go against the whole 'fighting terrorism' thing.

There are unlocked contract-free phones of course, but when buying any phone in a department store you sign a form where you leave your name. I guess you can lie, but's that not legal. I don't know about ebay, never bought a phone on there, but ebay isn't exactly anonymous in itself either.

They may still be "friendly" to bitcoin, but the government will want to control some aspect of it. The Chinese government might not be friendly to Google, yet under their supervision, Google China is the second biggest search engine in China.
I bet blockchain.info and btcchina.com didn't fulfill some sort of censorship requirement the government has of websites. It can't be wholly related to bitcoin because there are thousands of other sites to use that weren't censored. Maybe this is a message.
They've been sending mixed messages for some time now and that's normal behavior, however we do know this for certain: the Chinese government is monitoring the situation with interest.
