I’m 22 years old theoretically but i’m a student and most adults still see their kids as ‘kids’ when they’re in school. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:05:47
Finally, now i know where these brazzers ad’s on my pc come from..
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:32:15
I will for sure!! 
@_date: 2018-08-26 12:36:05
For as far as i know (Ajax seastonticket hodler) those ad’s can only be seen on television. If you are actually in the stadium you will see a black board.

Wrong. In Bitmex there are 2 price’s. One for your entry point for your contract which is based upon longs and shorts, the second one is the actual market price. You can check Bitmex yourself ;)
