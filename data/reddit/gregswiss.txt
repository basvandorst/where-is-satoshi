Good article. Any idea what the average ATM fees are around there?
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:57:12
Thanks. Thought that might be the case 
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:29:41
Good interview.

Have been using breadwallet for iOS for some time. Great. No issues at all, just write down your seed. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:51:03
+1 never any issues with the BW. Recommended. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:31:24
Personally I would put it in a hardware wallet so your private keys are safe, however you have to be prepared to shell out around 100$
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:54:19
Will be trying ledger nano 2 s shortly.

It claims to be provably fair, however I've learned my lesson that casino games are ultimately a losing proposition(online even more so) and only play sports. They do pay fast. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:10:37
Wonder how much he bought 
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:52:25
Usually higher fees at ATM for convenience factor. Also try localbitcoin.com

That's a couple free nights at the bar.

65000 unconfirmed should go through within hour
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:14:09
+1. They are good
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:07:30
I'm taxed in a couple countries, neither are the US ��
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:31:33
Agreed

A private key in the context of Bitcoin is a secret number that allows bitcoins to be spent. Every Bitcoin wallet contains one or more private keys, which are saved in the wallet file. The private keys are mathematically related to all Bitcoin addresses generated for the wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:27:40
I will take a look
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:42:43
I would not be giving that out easily
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:09:44
I read somewhere with the price per coin where it is they should be able to pay back the creditors 
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:37:32
That plant needs some water bub

@_date: 2017-05-29 11:54:06
Good stuff
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:51:31
A good one should be able to understand the premise and steer you in the right direction. Otherwise I probably wouldn't worry about it unless I was cashing out coin through exchange to bank account.
@_date: 2017-05-15 07:25:17
Recovery seed sorry. Those 12 words they bug you to write down. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:43:33
Grats. Let's make it 2
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:33:47
Now they should pay up
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:55:24
Also have the same problem 
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:18:31
Maybe back in college ��
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:27:21
Best of luck
@_date: 2017-05-15 08:00:45
Buy it on CB or what have you and then move it 
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:55:00
I think he was telling people to buy around 600
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:55:10
Bitcoin is growing daily. Good signs all around. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 07:40:39
Right. However would recommend bread wallet still as you keep the private keys locally on your phone. Otherwise if shit goes sideways and coin base goes down you could lose your coin. Also increased risk of hack. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:27:09
Agreed. That may be more the beginner thought Re needing to buy a full coin   
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:50:57
Low fee?
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:13:42
ViaBTC you can also pay .01 to get it added to next block if super urgent. It's at the bottom of the accelerator page
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:11:53
Ya I bet
