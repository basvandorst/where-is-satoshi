This is blowing my mind.  I loan somebody $122 for two days and they pay me back plus .012 cents interest?  If you did it every two days for a year, you'd earn $1.82 in interest.  Confused why any lender would take these terms.

But if C takes 10%, what's the borrowing interest rate going to have to be for the lender to get anything out of it?  Or are they paying me a portion of that 10%?  I wonder.

Today, gold's inflation rate is 1.3% and BTC's is 3.8%.  In 2024, two halving events from now, Bitcoin's inflation rate will be .9%.  From that year forward and for the rest of our lives, BTC will be a better inflation hedge than gold.  The tides will turn.

Nice thinking googling Mobira.  I was so sure it was bankrupt dust I didn't even think to look for it.  I'm glad to hear it.
Re: my quantum computing statement, I'm not so much worried about quantum computing cracking SHA-256, I was thinking more, what if they design a coin that only works on quantum computers that has all the security of BTC but, because of the power of quantum computing, can send QuantCoin from Sacramento to Bombay in .0000000001 seconds.  We would all naturally gravitate toward that, it'd be unstoppable.
Anyway, that's pretty great to hear that Mobira is (or was absorbed by) Nokia.  A ray of hope for our analogy.

I love BTC.  I'm fully on-board but this meme could be used to make the case against crypto speculation as well.
A lot of smart people are asking, How can we be sure BTC will still be relevant in 50 years?  I hate that this is even a possibility but, for example, maybe some coin will be designed specifically for quantum computers that will take BTC's place.
This meme happens to make that point unintentionally. Yes, cell phones are here to stay but who's ever heard of Mobira?

If you hear anyone going on about CP on the blockchain, show them [this]( great article.  I even learned a new word reading it last night: steganography.
TL;DR there's a memo field in BTC called Op_return, people put unsavory data there at times in the past, but it doesn't hurt BTC's fundamentals because Op_return can be deleted without touching the ledger.
