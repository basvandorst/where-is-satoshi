It's called day trading.
Usually it's for way less than 3-5% but with bitcoin's volatility you can still consider it day trading.
There are 2 problems with that :
-the coin never goes back to the price you bought, so you either close your position at a loss or have funds stuck for days/weeks/months or even years or forever
-the coin "always" go up, so you get less profit that someone that just held, except if you got really lucky, but you're against the statistics if you short on an uptrend
So it's risky even on a sideway market, even if that's basically the only way to make money when price stays the same for long periods of time, but on uptrends or downtrends it's stupid.

I love when people say "thanks for the cheap coins" because I know that the truth is they're all in and just lost a lot of value but pretend they don't care.

Then you didn't look hard enough because yesterday there was the exact same wall on gdax and it got bought.
Also gdax is not making the price, bitfinex already has twice the volume and there are many more exchanges.
If you're really in bitcoin for more than a year then you should read more and educate yourself before you make threads.

Sounds like the perfect story and the right buzzwords to get upvotes from r/btc haters.

God is not real you idiot.
That's your real mistake in the whole story.
