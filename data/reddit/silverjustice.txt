BTC value is only tied to fees because of scarce blockspace.

anyone else think 5 years is way too long?

I completely agree... and it would do a power of good to its price and market cap as a result...
I think there needs to be some sort of compromise if we are to move forward at all...
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:36:39
But its utility has decreased. A number of businesses have stopped dealing with it. Perhaps its price would have been higher if they hadn't

What insane levels? All a lot of people wanted was an increase to 8MB limit. Monero already has a bigger block than that. Dash has already hardforked to increase their blocks, - and they are doing just fine!

I agree, I think a hardfork to 4MB today would really help to unite the community under the Core umbrella, and help pave the path forward.

Well I'd rather trust the creator, than some centralized mob that took over something that was already working.

The zero cost transaction was definitely one of its special features in the early days and its what got a lot of us early adopters into it.

Its a gag article

Nope. Bitcoin is the king. But facts a facts
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:03:58
yeah... given most miners are happy to forego these fees, maybe the timing is premature right now?
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:40:19
you're not wrong. The more transactions the higher the fees. And its popularity is causing exponential growth in fees.

Syscoin has activated Segwit

I agree it shouldn't be completely free. But it should be very cheap - much less than bank transactions. - Bitcoin is about challenging the current system with something new and ground-breaking. It wouldn't be so ground-breaking if we are paying the same fees as paypal.
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:09:15
Especially when other coins will offer this exact same transaction for free... This is where bitcoin is falling behind right now.
@_date: 2017-04-19 06:00:08
Except not everyone in every country is so well off... Or is Bitcoin just for the elites?
@_date: 2017-04-18 04:20:02
You realize this is impossible.
The mining difficulty adjusts - so as computers get more powerful, it becomes much harder to mine. That clever satoshi thought of everything!
@_date: 2017-04-19 04:37:04
how is there 'nothing' backing bitcoin?
Let me tell you what backs it right now. It is by far, the most secure, the most immutable blockchain in existance. Meaning, your money is absolutely secure. It's only threat is losing this network effect over time. But so far, it appears that even if it loses its % netowrk effect, its still growing in price.

at which point does it become mathematically unbearable for supercomputers to attack?

The beautiful thing about patents though, is that someone ALWAYS finds a better way.
Honestly, this patent will only speed up competitors to produce something to beat it. all great businesses have their time in the light... And all businesses turn to dust

All he had to do was trade it for BTC.
Does it really warrant cries for help and theatrics?
@_date: 2017-05-15 00:33:32
None of the other cryptos are having issues with blocks that aren't full. I'm pretty sure most if not all don't plan on having full blocks until the near end of the diminishing supply curve...
We are still over 100 years away from Bitcoin's supply heading to zero. While I agree that eventually we need to move to a fee based system, this shouldn't happen artificially as it is now.

You're missing the fact that Core are genuinely stagnating Bitcoin.
Every move they make, is a move to hold back the scaling efforts more and more.
The Hong Kong agreement was one that was agreed to by the mining majority for example. It was a compromise - but it was agreed to. That was a 2MB blocksize + Segwit. Then Core pulled back - since then, fees have gone through the roof.
As Gavin says, they are clearly out to hurt Bitcoin.
They are simply not trusted by the community anymore...
When Bitcoin fees are almost $5, you have to ask yourself - how much bigger would Bitcoin be today, if it wasn't so limited. Okay, maybe a big blocksize isn't so wanted by the entire community - But given that Core were already in agreement of a 2MB blocksize, and there is ample evidence that it will not affect decentralization, and also given that the Sheer majority of the community would be happy to increase the blocksize to 2MB - why won't they?
If Segwit already provides some capacity increase, and if today we can have 'one' of its features, why not at least get that done as a first measure? - Not only would Core help in resolving their shattered image, they'd get some respect back from some of the community, and everyone would be better off working together to help rebuild and unite.
Literally everything they do points to intentional conflict and stagnation.
