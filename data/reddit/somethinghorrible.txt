I understand your anger and frustration, but dude, seriously...




The problem is that you didn't hold anything (unless you're claiming your own private wallet was hacked). You left your coins on deposit with an exchange that 1) was not a bank, 2) was not covered by any deposit insurance, 3) was owned by a private citizen, and 4) had next to zero transparency.
I mainly used virwox to exchange between $ and BTC, but in small amounts that if the transactions didn't work I'd be fine with losing. Because, yeah, when you invest/use a currency not backed by any government or established commodity, you're kind of on your own.
It's real shitty what's happening to you and to a lot of people. However, barring any blatant fraud, the matter is a civil one and you're going to have to do the legwork yourself (i.e. sue). But good luck on that.
EDIT: as an aside, the description of includes "As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. ". It should include that it is very susceptible to corrupt individuals and fraud.
