I know that when managing my own bitcoin wallet, a new address should be created for every incoming transaction.  But I don't know what the point of this app creating a new address for each transaction when the final destination is the same address.   Also, where are the private keys stored for these newly created addresses?  Who pays the transaction fee to deliver the funds from the newly created address to my deposit address?

Wow, that is REALLY cool!  I like that, what a great find.  And for others wondering, green = input address, red = output address, yellow is an address that shows up on both the input and output of the transaction which is the small blue.

Mycelium lets me choose between 3 different fees.  Economic, 0.01mBTC or Normal, 0.1 mBTC or Priority, 0.2 mBTC

The small blue squares are transactions.  Each small blue square is connected to green, red, and yellow addresses.  As the funds are moved, and new transactions are created, then addresses get connected to other blue squares and pulled to group those transactions together so you can visualize the chain.

Why doesn't the add tell us the correct price of over $101 that I'm quoted on the web site.   Here are the numbers being reported to me.
$119 = 0.4730 BTC
after the discount of -0.0710 BTC, total comes to 0.4021
119 / 0.4730 * 0.4021 = $101.16
Maybe the math needs to be adjusted on the back end of the web site?  Or maybe the add needs to be adjusted to be more accurate?
