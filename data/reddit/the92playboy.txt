Yup, HD-DVD went the porn route, which is why plenty of people, at least at first, predicted HD-DVD to win the war (there was other factors such as it was cheaper to retrofit a conventional DVD assembly line to HD-DVD than Blu-Ray but porn was a major factor). I thought we were watching history repeat itself; VHS beat out Betamax (a clearly superior technology) because the porn community (as in both industry and the moms and dads at home making their own xxx movies for themselves) embraced VHS almost exclusively. But, this time, several factors came into play. One, the licensing/exclusiveness wars for different studios very early started going in Blu-Rays favour, and it's one of those things, where once Studio A and Studio B go over, then Studio C is very leery about going with HD-DVD. Secondly, and this was very smart of Sony, they included a Blu-Ray player in their PS3. So, you had a choice, buy a stand-alone Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player for $350 minimum, more likely over $400, or kick in another $150-200 and get a video game console as well (these prices are approximate, I am going from memory from what stuff cost me in Canada at the time). And thirdly, high def porn on physical media didn't catch on that well, or at least not as well as some expected. Porn was already transitioning to the interwebs, so now there was a cheaper, easier, less embarrassing and more personalized method to get porn. And, people were finding that they didn't really care for porn in 1080p; pornstars can look stunning in 480, and really lose some of their luster in full high def when you can make out which pimple on her ass is about to burst later that night.

I don't believe that's what happening (I think everyone is pretty much fucked) but IF that's what they were doing, is there any laws stating they need to announce that they are? (oh I know, the laws are all grey once we enter crypto-currencies).But, hypothetically, if they chose not to tell anyone about an outage, knowing it would drive the price down, allowing them as individuals or Mt.Gox as an entity to buy up lots cheap(er), and then they come back online and the prices stabilize (as much as BT does), has anything illegal happened? Can you "insider trade" a currency (which is a crypto currency anyways)?

Or, he would make say $20 million USD in BTC, transfer it to USD, and start again, repeatedly buying low and selling high.

Because people want to see the price crash to extremely low levels so they can load up and reap the rewards when it skyrockets back up afterwards. They don't want it to drop 10% and then return to it's price so that they make 10% profit, they want it to drop +70% so that they can load up and sell it days later for 70% profit, or weeks/months later when it is 300% more profit (also of those  are hypothetical)

He tipped a handful of randomn redditors yesterday large sums of bitcoin, with no specific explanation other than he had lots. One redditor received ~$4500 (USD), and the total amount tipped was over $13000 USD.Of course, then people started asking/begging/bugging for bitcoins, and bitcoinbillionaire said he was done with it, and left.Or did he???? O_ONo, he left.

Another thing to consider, servers have to "tip out" the back of house staff as well, and in some places they have to tip out a % of sales regardless of the $ amount of tips they receive.So, not only could you be ripping them off of a tip, but you could even be costing them money as they would have to tip out the cooks, dishwashers etc even though you left no actual money.

Happy birthday!When I read it was your 24th birthday, I felt compelled to comment. I too, have an April birthday (12th) and just celebrated my 34th birthday, but I remember my 24th birthday very well.The TL;DR is that I went out that night a single guy, met a girl who by my 25th birthday was pregnant with my child and by my 26th birthday my fiancee, and my 27th my wife.So, you just reminded me of an age and a different life of mine from a decade ago. Enjoy your birthday!

You don't understand how tipping out works; it is not the company (restaurant) that loses money, it is the server that would be losing money.In regards to not tipping, that's your personal opinion and that's fine. In Canada, it is widely recognized that servers make very little wage wise, often have to work split shifts, and rely on tips to provide the bulk of their income.

I thought there was a rule about only going 8 decimal places to combat that.
