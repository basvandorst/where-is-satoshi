Been in since summer of '17. I've held, cried, screamed, cried some more, but never sold. 
Shall the Crypto gods finally shower me with benevolence for my faith?

Some people genuinely need welfare and I'm all for contributing to help them out.
 Others (a lot) are lazy, bottom-feeding, scum bags that contribute nothing to society and, though fully capable, make no effort to better themselves or their situation. 
I have been beyond broke and borderline homeless. I got what jobs I could, went to school and started investing what I could. Now I am comfortable and don't need help from anyone. It was a long, shitty road but it's not impossible by any means.
TLDR: Welfare is good for those that need it but is also a drain that gets abused by the dregs of society.

Cool. Now if Gavin doesn't destroy what's left of CA in the process that would be even cooler.
