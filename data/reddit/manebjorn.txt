Depends on what your focus is. You can work with local businesses and people to setup to accept bitcoin. So many things you can do. Start a project and use Bitcoin.

This is disturbing. Coinbase is one of the companies that complies with even more AML and KYC stuff than even banks.
For a law to be so out of whack they even pull out is not a good sign.

Hi I will clear up the data center and head quarters tour situation.
For the last 2 1/2 months I have been saying I will go to visit and see their setups.  I have spoken to Josh about it and it is a go.
The reason I have not been there does lead to your second question.
I have had 2 surgeries in the last 3 months.  One is a multiple vertebrae spinal fusion.  Recovery has not been going well and I am the hold up.  I was able to get to Vegas conferences and it was difficult for me to say the least as I have to lay down every so often.  I will see if I can get to a GAW data center sooner rather than later to bring you a review of it.
I have also on that note been invited to several different companies such as Genesis-Mining, Rockminer, ZeusMiner and others and I will go to them as my body allows me. I am almost done with a audit checklist for verifying data centers and software while allowing proprietary information to remain safe for companies that invite me in.
As for donations the community did a fundraiser for me through CryptoCause.  I was able to catch up a couple medical bills with doctors I need to keep seeing such as the one who programs my spinal cord stimulator implant.  
Current donations are not something I am asking for a friend started a current one for me.  
I do not work for GAW and have not received money from GAW for my writing.  I do not own CCN I am just an writer there so advertiser funds to not affect me either way. 
I am disabled and I am coming to terms with that.  Being part of the communities in tech and also cryptocurrencies is something that has allowed me to be part of things still when I have lost the ability to do so much.  I feel like it is a great community around the web here, BitcoinTalk, HashTalk and so many others.  Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies have brought so many together in a common cause it is wonderful.
@_date: 2014-06-12 01:41:19
Good job.
P2Pool definitely needs more recognition.
NastyPool is an excellent implementation of it.
Keep up the efforts.
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:34:01
Well said.
I wish the board would take this seriously.  It seems they don't care.  It is disgusting.  If Brock is really innocent (and it looks like he is not) then either way he should step down now.  
Good luck as well.  I hope that you can win this.  It makes no sense that you should be held accountable for other peoples actions.  What is being done to you is akin to the CEO of Ford being thrown in jail because a driver of a Ford vehicle got a parking ticket.  Was it wrong that the driver was in violation of the parking ordinance?  Yes.  Was it the Ford CEO's fault the driver did that?  No.
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:27:15
That is very cool.
I think it is interesting and exciting how much they are doing with Dark Wallet.  Hopefully more people jump on board.  So many good features here.

The article about the Robocoin ATM was not meant to bash Bitcoin.  It was a very frustrated CEO of a Bitcoin company contacting me with his experience.  
I am in contact with Robocoin as they want to address the concerns in the article.
I am one of the biggest supporters of Bitcoin and crypto currencies. Being disabled being part of the Bitcoin world has expanded my horizons that had been closed to me by my disabling injury.  Writing about Bitcoin and supporting the companies and people in the industry is my goal.  Unfortunately sometimes there are not always positive stories.
I will continue to support Bitcoin, it's people and businesses.
I appreciate the feedback.  I will make sure when I am ready with Robocoin's response I will post it in r/Bitcoin to share that side as well.

CCN is completely privately owned and to my knowledge the owner has no shares in GAW.  He has also turned down many different companies who had wanted to buy CCN or buy shares in it.
As for me I own no shares in GAW but I do have some Hashlets I purchased to be able to review the platform.
The same as LTCGear, Genesis-Mining, ZeusHash, HashNest and a couple others.  I will have reviews of them up as well over the coming days and weeks. 
I am going to interview Josh again very soon and I will ask some more direct questions to get more details. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 00:39:20
You watch he will sell the Bitcoin trademark next to a huge bank who will then sue Bitcion out of recognition rather than compete.
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:25:05
Nobody cares or ghash would not be pushing 43% again.
That is the worst part of it all.
ghash will keep doing it because they know that they can go as far as they want the rabble will throw a fit they back off and a couple big players pull out temporarily and then it calms the big players come back and they keep on going.
The only thing that will stop them is when it hits them in their wallet.
@_date: 2014-08-10 13:04:58
That is a great project! 
You should sell the kits already setup.

You need an internet connection on the phone or cam you are using to scan the QR code.
The unit itself does not have internet connections.  Version 2 even takes it further with the disconnect of all able devices on the unit.  I will have a review of V2 with the changes listed.
It is like an electronic version of a paper wallet.  Pretty neat, not perfect but developing improvements.
@_date: 2014-07-31 18:59:50

Great Job!!!
It is nice to see people who care helping people in need.
@_date: 2014-07-14 01:29:13
I do not use it as a wallet.  I happened to have the BTC in there when I wanted to make my purchase.
I did not think the extra step of sweeping to my wallet then paying would be necessary. I would have thought 15 min window BitPay had would not be an issue for Coinbase.  Instead it was and Tiger Direct does not want to deal with it.
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:47:39
P2Pool would be the best alternative to any pool gaining over 33% of the hash rate. Not sure yet how it would be handled if it was 51% as it would need one specific pool operator to be controlling it all. Not likely to happen. I will read up on it more though.
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:57:40
Now Satoshi will not be allowed to be anonymous.  I am glad this is not the law and NYS is not in the taking input from companies and people to draft the final guildlines.  So we as a community have to put out there our feelings on it and ways it needs to be fixed.

I know that CryptoCoinsNews has sponsored stories clearly marked.  The authors including me when I say do a review note if I purchased the unit or if it was a review unit.
Disclosures are found in the articles as well.
Most sites have sponsored stories and many of those listed make sure to let the readers know.  I do see some that do not you are correct but lumping all in together is not correct.
Cygnify has a solid breakdown and with a bit more looking into it many more would be out of the untrustworthy category.
I do respect your article altering people to pay closer attention though.  I know there have been times I have read articles and not realized until well into them it was a sponsored article.  This includes sites like USA Today, CNN, Huffington, MSNBC etc.
@_date: 2014-07-19 08:08:01
Great to know you are fully behind crypto.
We need more companies to stand up and say they are here and staying.  We also need to come up with a list of ways the regulations could be made workable as well in a way that does not ruin privacy and entrepreneurship.

Right now they are expensive but they are the only buy/sell ATM's at the moment.   With the new generations of them I think prices are going to keep coming down for them.
The ease in which they can scale up to add additional currencies like Litecoin and Doge is a big plus for them as well.
That all being said the more crypto currency ATM companies that are out there producing them will help drive the prices down as well.  Skyhook is another entrant I look forward to seeing as well.
(I am the author of the article if you have more questions for Robocoin let me know I will ask them and publish the answers.)
@_date: 2014-07-12 00:00:26
It would be great if it worked.
We tried several times to have it work with my mom's new account and her laptop.  Each time it came back wrong IP.
I would be much happier if Coinbase fixed the delayed transactions that make it unusable to purchase anything.

London looks to move forward with bitcoin and NY looks to stomp it out. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:33:55
It is simple gHash does not care.  If they did they would institute a 1% or 2% fee.  Miners would then naturally move around to different pools.  They want to have as much of the hash rate as possible.
Greed is what rules them not what is good for Bitcoin or the community.  They will be happy the more centralized it gets as long as they are the pool that it is centralized too.

@_date: 2014-06-12 19:24:58
They are already greedy.  Implementing a fee removes the incentive for new and uneducated miners from not exploring other options.

@_date: 2014-07-21 04:59:51
The problem is the vague area of mining puts pool operators at risk. P2pool should be ok as mining is exempt. Big pool operators are considered businesses under the law and may need to do all the crap licensing stuff. Hopefully this gets fixed and clarified.

It is a nice step forward for P2Pool visibility. 
I also hope that more development will follow to further spur innovation with P2Pool protocol. We need more people mining on it. 
Bitmain has stated they will move most of HashNest's mining to P2Pool soon so that will help. 
They are serious about it unlike PETA Mine.

@_date: 2014-11-06 00:17:06
I do write for them I never said I did not.  I do read other news and enjoy doing so.  If CoinFire comes up with other info that will be great as well.
As for GAW do we just not cover them?  So far we have not been able to prove its a scam.  With the coverage it brings scrutiny which is good.  I want these questions to come up.  We all need to be skeptical of the businesses in the industry.  As things go we will see more proof or exposure.  That is as it should be.
If no one covers it then it can be just as bad because then there is less scrutiny.  I am not looking to give or take legitimacy but to simply give the info as it comes out.
When I get to go to their data centers and see this in person it will clear up some more things good or bad.  I will report it.
@_date: 2014-06-12 01:43:57

@_date: 2014-06-14 04:36:17
I am invested as well in PETA Mine and I would like to see them get off ghash/cex as well.
When worrying about variance they forget as more people leave ghash/cex the variance at other pools will get less.  With so much power in one place it causes massive variance everywhere but there.
So please move all the power off ghash/cex.  Bitcoin needs that.  P2Pool is the way to go.
Move some mining power to NastyPool for a while to test out how it works.  It is the most stable P2Pool node.

P2Pool is getting there.
NastyPool does not have merged mining yet but it is the best out there.  nonnakip is actively working on updating P2Pool as well to address some of the issues you have detailed.
Send a few th/s there for 72 hrs and you will see they do a good job.  Also by spreading out the hash rate around the variance gets better.  Just allowing ghash to grow bigger and bigger until you have no choice but to mine there is when they will add fees and they will not be 1 or 2 % that is for sure.

I agree and it can be difficult to get information from some of them as well.  Most are private companies as well and not subject to SEC transparency.
That being said I have asked GAW about how they are dealing with FinCEN and the SEC with the ICO.  Once I get an answer I will get the info right up.

I agree on the ad space making it muddied.  That is one reason I do not articles on each announcement every week.  It would be too much.
I am already digging by verifying hardware and more.  That being said I will make sure to take it further.  There is lots of room to improve and that is my goal.  
From what I have been able to see so far is the the Hashlet system is much like CEX in that you can buy and sell hash rate that is backed up by hardware.  Hashlets have more bells and whistles that are managed by some interesting software.  Once I get the close look at it I will be able to report directly on.
I am wary as well of another GOX or BFL and KnC and so far GAW has been able to do what they say.  I will keep digging and not just on GAW.

BlockChain Wallet is a good way to go.  You can always import your key into an offline wallet from it.
When they did have that outage I just imported my key into the bitcoin qt wallet and did not miss a beat or access to my coins.
Coinbase is good but still an exchange.  
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:31:53
I did not delete my account.  
As for the interview that is just what it is.
I will be going and seeing their data centers and get to see the software that runs the Hashlet system.  If I find it is BS or less than it should be I will report on it.
So far I have been able to verify Bitmain, Rockminer, ZeusMiner and a couple others as the suppliers of the hardware.  
So far they have lots of hash rate and are continuing to build out.  
As far as the software goes that runs the Hashlet system I am not 100% on it yet and will be able to share more when I go there in person soon.
I appreciate your input and will take the criticism constructively and make sure to adjust my articles accordingly so there is no mistake I am not shilling for anyone.
Thank you.

Really big news for Bitcoin as it shows just how much investment there is going to be going forward. It is exciting. I wonder what the next big acquisition or investment will be and from who into the bitcoin world. 
It's going to be an interesting next 6 months or so. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:10:16
It is also a tricky deal as many of these setups are not clear if you can claim your gold or not either.

I want to pay my massive medical debt. I just had my second surgery in 6 weeks and 4 th in two years. It has piled up.
@_date: 2015-01-07 08:14:11
I write about both sides.
@_date: 2016-01-11 04:52:45
This is so absurd. 
A tax on your illegal drugs. 
Gotta love the tax and legal systems in the US for sheer insanity.

Definitely, he is very knowledgeable and has excellent insights.
@_date: 2016-03-16 21:49:24
This looks really good. It solves many issues and makes it easier to scale up.
I like that he is always digging and testing even though he is at MIT.
@_date: 2016-03-16 22:14:03
I agree with you there. I hope it cycles back to being more positive as things get worked out on the development end of it all.
@_date: 2016-03-16 21:46:00
What are some of the big changes in the community have you seen over the past few years that stand out in your mind?
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:30:08
I agree Tom had done good stuff. I remember hearing about his issues when he was getting hammered. It was not good.
@_date: 2016-03-14 23:58:55
I understand their goals with their ASIC. They had been poised to do much more from what we were told. I hope they are able to progress but currently it looks tenuous.  If they cut in half the price of their unit they could actually get more people on the platform.  Time will tell I am interested in seeing them do well. The more they release the the more solid their position.

Excellent writeup on mining. 
Thanks for the link. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 16:31:49
I hope more people come forward and expose the scams some of these companies are perpetrating.
Great article Neil.
@_date: 2016-01-06 15:48:11
I agree, it seems the more people I talk to from India the more I find they are learning about Bitcoin. I hope it keeps up. Bitcoin can help so many of them there that are unbanked yet connected to the internet.

Hi grewalsatinder,
This was just brought to my attention.  We apologize for the error.
JP acted inappropriately in handling this. 
All articles have image sources noted at the end of the article. If he did not do that it should have been updated with the source. 
JP is a freelance writer who writes for several sites such Bitcoinist.net, Bitcoin.com, TheMerkle.com, NewsBTC.com and others. Sometimes that work load can get the best of him. 
If you have any other issues please contact me directly so I can make sure it is taken care of for you.
@_date: 2014-07-13 14:52:37
Me too. It was not stored there it was Bitcion that I had not swept into cold storage yet. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:40:15
I do not think BitFury will be. They are more than just mining and have had nearly $100 million in VC investing to date. 
21inc on the other hand I am not sure. They botched their ASIC launch with the overpriced box they sell and only a few small uses for it including the new sales tools.
Will be interesting though to see who will be here by next summer.
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:23:07
I want to be clear I have not accepted any money from GAW.  The only funds I received were from the community through a fund raiser setup by Crypto Cause.  They are not affiliated with GAW.  The fund raiser was the communities response to help me with my medical bills as I had two surgeries this summer 6 weeks apart.  I had finally vented my frustration on the forums this summer and they did this I was not looking for it and asked if it was ok before accepting it.  I have donated the funds on to others due to the harassment I have received over it.
I have covered GAW both good and bad.  I have not done the follow ups I had anticipated this past couple weeks due to the negativity. I am not doing more GAW related articles good or bad.
As for the slant it was not intentional one side or the other. 
The Bitcoin and alt-coin community is something I support fully.  I do not condone hacks like coinfire suffered nor censorship.  The issue with GAW, PayBase and PayCoin is very divisive with many supporters and detractors ardent in their stances and they should all have a voice.  
I will continue to work to do better in my reporting and support our entire community.
I appreciate all of your stances, never stop learning, growing and questioning.  The blockchain has so much potential and we are just at the beginning the future holds so much promise for us all.
@_date: 2016-01-10 05:48:19
This ten times over.
@_date: 2016-01-10 05:47:14
Nice one and I agree.
If only we could ease the chaos within Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-09 06:07:48
Bad luck is an understatement. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:39:38
That is cool, Japan is really starting to lead the way with Bitcoin adoption and use cases.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:23:02
 Good to see the price recovering and now powering up. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:59:39
Definitely interesting but the focus on blockchain and not bitcoin kind of sucks. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:17:25
That is an amazing collection. I never knew about the 1k coins. Very very cool. I like the 2Fa setup with them. Thank you for sharing.
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:18:16
Wow, that is even more crazy cool.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:20:17
They got a statement from him via email. How is that not a source? 
@_date: 2015-08-13 19:30:49
It is interesting as more companies embrace Bitcoin to see where it goes.
I wonder how Bitlicense will affect these and other companies?
@_date: 2015-08-28 08:03:22
For me it is that the miners are another facet of the Bitcoin ecosystem that is now letting their views be heard.
It should not just be miners or devs or some other part it should be everyone making their voices heard on this right now.
@_date: 2015-08-15 00:26:11
Congratulations guys!!  Way to show them Bitcoin and decentralized systems are where things are headed for the future.
@_date: 2015-08-25 06:52:05
F2Pool standing up against XT is big. Between them and some of the smaller pools that is a quarter of the hash rate. All it will take is another big pool to follow. It is interesting to see miners having their say now.
@_date: 2015-08-28 05:36:11
Really just Bitmain with Antpool and BW left for the big ones.
This should mean that BIP100 be finalized and tested over the next few months and then rolled out after bug squashing.
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:12:51
The worst part of this is that Lawsky crafted this with the intention of setting up a private sector business to "help" people and companies navigate this mess. 
Disgusting crony regulations and lack of ethics created this. 
He is a disgrace and BitLicense is a giant 31 page mess just to apply. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:25:14
I agree it is disturbing for sure in that respect.
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:25:03
BitFury is really kicking butt with vc funding. 
Their 100 mw could add another 200 ph/s to the network. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:16:48
The sickening thing is it was all calculated and his wishy washy response that he would still consult on digital currency means he will still be dealing with the problems he created with BitLicense directly or not.
Pure unethical scum.
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:24:49
Mega Watt
Sorry about the confusion.
@_date: 2017-04-10 21:54:43
Good point. It does add some legitimacy to it. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:01:16
I agree, this is really fascinating. 
It is better that this is happening now instead of 2 years from now.
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:08:11
I agree 100%.
It is sickening.
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:53:51
From the settings I see I do not think you can Downvolt it that far. 
looks like it goes either + or- 2 points either way with the full effect definitely not 1/5 the speed total. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:40:12
It will depend on how they actually implement and use it. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:23:43
What is going to be interesting is how the government handles this. It could be a good thing and further clarify the requirements and relationships between banks and Cryptocurrency exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 19:44:30
The current firmware does not have super fine tuning controls but you can adjust the voltage up or down a bit using the advanced option and then adjust the voltage offset.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:08:13
This is really cool to see. I wonder which will others will follow. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:38:54
Just link back to the source article on Bitsonline.com and you should be good. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 05:57:53
SO does this mean they will not have their own version of BitLicense or will they do something different?
@_date: 2015-04-25 05:15:31
Great work guys.  Charles and his team have been non-stop working on growing and helping the industry.
@_date: 2015-09-17 23:48:23
Stash looks like it could be useful. If it can securely keep track of off chain transactions that is great.
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:04:49
Nice work! 
@_date: 2015-09-09 16:35:02
It is working for me. 
I'm on a mobile browser.
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:14:52
Interesting. I wonder what type of things he will do at Xapo.
@_date: 2015-04-01 06:13:48
Drew had an excellent interview with Andreas.  I thought I would share his article. Enjoy.
@_date: 2016-10-31 03:09:22
Could be worse at least they don't think you're Chezza. LOL 
@_date: 2016-10-17 09:26:42
Agreed, they are nice as well.
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:27:15
That is really cool.
It would be cool if there were more companies that did that.
@_date: 2015-03-15 09:45:52
That is good to hear. I wondered where you were.
I hope Bitcoin can help people there and it sounds like it can.
@_date: 2017-05-03 08:44:28
Not a scam,
Just a bit of FYI as we deal with this as well. 
Onecoin is threatening news sites, bloggers and individuals. 
We received a threat from a lawyer recently on their behalf for publishing an article that had publicly available information that was verifiable and published at sites around the world. Nothing is liable in the articles.
We also interviewed Bjorn who has claimed they had no coin or blockchain and he provided his side of the issue. It is not illegal nor liable to interview people. 
We followed up with this before we got our own threat as they sent it to an email we had not setup yet as we are still in the process of launching all the site parts. 
So no this is not a begging scam. It is onecoin using lawyers to harass publications. 
The information in our articles, Coinspondent and several others is publicly available and not liable yet harassment through lawyers is being used to intimidate and threaten to censor the information.
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:14:30
You did not need to do that.  It is just good to hear from you again. You have been all over the place again it seems. :-)
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-03-16 08:36:19
Congratulations! 
I use CheapAir for almost all my travel when I can go. The discounts and ability to pay in Bitcoin rules.
Enjoy your trip.
@_date: 2015-03-07 19:51:51
It is going to be interesting to see what features they add first. It was a surprise when it went up for sale. FinalHash wasted no time. I'm glad it didn't close. 
They bought it awhile ago.
@_date: 2015-03-15 09:41:39
Good to know, I will pass the word around as well. 
Keep making the chips they rule.
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:57:10
So cool that is for sure.
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:56:51
That would be nice if it hit that. Even better if it did it this summer. LOL
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:29:08
Crappy thing is the IRS will not rest.  They will come back in a different way for the info. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 19:43:23
You are all about being happy today. 
Very cool.
@_date: 2015-03-11 02:23:05
Tina does a great job. Met her in person a couple times. She is a great Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency advocate.
Keep up the great work Follow the Coin!
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:13:50
You are right.  A few bits at a time.  
Well done.
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:11:31
Note: I see the info now.
Looks very nice.
Are they silver or what types of metals?
Where can people but them?
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:26:24
Very cool idea Calvin.
I think you will do great with it.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:37:03
ICOs are getting crazy. There are a ton of them and many are just exit scams prior to even delivering anything.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:01:34
Hopefully no bugs and we can have a smooth transition in a couple weeks. Just want this issue to be in the past and have Bitcoin get back to growth.
@_date: 2015-03-13 01:51:16
Charlie, best wishes dude. We are all learning as Bitcoin grows. I hope they let you out soon.
@_date: 2016-05-18 01:07:40
They are definitely nice wallets, easy to read, secure, simple to use. 
They are working on updates as well. I finally got to use one I really like it. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:34:06
Any news coming out of it yet?
@_date: 2016-07-09 01:47:57
No idea. 
No matter where he is he is still scum. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:40:18
I am happy too, I am not looking forward to a chain split that would devastate Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-04 00:08:49
They are real.
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:14:41
More misinformation from mainstream media.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:47:33
Of course. The thing is do you think he will actually do it?
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:37:48
Kind of a goofy petition yet it would still be a good means of getting word out about Bitcoin to people who may not know much about it. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:30:52
 Great, so he will start to sue news media organizations just like onecoin. LOL 
@_date: 2016-07-04 00:08:22
I have published a review of the Baikal X11 ASIC and will be following this week with the iBeLink X11 ASIC and the Pinidea X11 ASIC.
They are real and work well. Kind of feels like in the early days of the Bitcoin ASICs coming into the industry.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:37:29
This is disheartening to see.
