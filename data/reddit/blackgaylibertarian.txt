I disagree. Right now you can cause a 5% rally with a relatively low bankroll due to the low volume. If you buy 60 BTC at 13400 and drive it up to around 14k (pretty easy, especially if you are syncing up with RSI and the BB bands), you make 40k in a few hours. 
Watch GDAX you see this all the time. You will commonly see a pattern where you will have a pretty big moving buy wall (e.g., 75 BTC), with a couple smaller walls spaced in front of it (20 BTC and 8 BTC). Then, the 8 BTC wall will hover near the market price, hoping that smaller investors eat through the resistance in the sell book. If the smaller investors don't fully eat through, the smaller wall will get pulled, and sellers will gobble up all of the small orders that have been placed behind the 8 BTC wall up to the 20 BTC wall. Then, the three walls will start driving upwards again to each point of major price resistance, letting other buyers do the work. Rinse and repeat until you hit your target (e.g, selling into the 14k buy wall).
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:27:46
Man, I've seen a couple whales buying like 20-40 BTC in individual buys on GDAX the last hour or so. These guys are either anticipating on driving the price up, or just got boned.
I've been pretty pessimistic recently, but now we have perfect conditions for a whale-driven rally (low volume, relatively significant consolidation).

If you got rid of manipulators, the price would crash hard.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:13:04
Dude, this is naive. There are a bunch of ways to manipulate here that are illegal in regulated commodity markets. For example, you'd face prison time if you spoofed buy and sell pressure in the books with no intention to buy. This happens all the time in all crypto markets.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:43:29
This is asinine bullshit son. Of course bubbles can last years. The difference with BTC is that 40% of it is owned by a few people that can use practices illegal in normal commodities markets to prop up the price like fake orders in the buy and sell books to simulate price resistance. I see this daily, as I trade crypto daily in large amounts.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:36:30
Dude, I don't get your point. I was answering the guy's question. Those are some factors to pay attention to here. For example, if you see evidence that whales are in control and triggering stop losses to accumulate (possible due to low weekend volume, there is a decent chance we go back up).
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:28:31
Just stating what the charts show. There isnt even support throughout.
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:36:34
I think today, and possibly tomorrow, are gigantic in terms of where BTC goes. If we drop below 12,600 we are going well under 10k in the near future. If we clear 15k, it is going up to 20k+. You can kind of see it in the chart too. Big movement is coming in one direction or the other. I don't think the whales will have a high incentive to stop either move (they would happily buy at 8k, or unload at 20k).
EDIT* I also see a weird 15k sell wall that seems designed not to be bought through on GDAX, and something similar that reappears on Bittrex (symmetrical staggered steps). It reeks of manipulation. Not sure if it is to drive down to 8k, or for accumulation, but someone is going to send us in one way or another. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:13:43
Lol, people saying this bubble is ready to pop don't know what they are talking about at all. 
There are too many whales still around relative to the number of individual retail buyers, and too many long-term holders looking for 100k BTC. The whales manipulate the price of BTC daily, engineering mini pump and dumps for short-run profits, and keeping the overall trajectory positive (thus attracting more retail liquidity). The price just can't drop too far because these guys can throw up massive buy walls to bolster natural price resistance, and there are too many holders to create enough momentum to overcome these walls. These guys can literally control the price floor with like a couple hundred BTC on a few exchanges right now. 
The whales won't let the bubble pop until they have fully cashed out, which just isn't possible until more retail buyers have bought in. 
Once the whales have all cashed out, yes, the bubble will pop.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:27:00
Because it is a huge economic bubble, but there are too many whales who own a lot and can easily manipulate the price. They need to continue w/volatility and price rises so that they can unload their huge amounts before the bubble bursts. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:54:54
And it will survive until the 1000 people who own nearly half can keep this "growth" speculation cycle going through price manipulation until the market is liquid long enough for them to fully cash out (i.e., they have transferred their stakes to retail investors). Don't pretend like you don't see the buy and sell walls on GDAX doing this. The fun is that they need to continue to have huge growth ($40k next) to induce more retail buyers to further create market liquidity. 
My only real question is if their funds fully go into fiat, or if they go into other cryptos (I'm betting a mix of both).
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:24:37
Also, that isn't to say that the crypto market will collapse, or even the BTC bubble will burst. There is a good chance that the whales (and retail investors) diversify enough into other cryptos that there will be other strong cryptos that will take BTC's place. There is also a decent chance that institutional money and options lock in a high price for BTC. But, the current behavior is being driven by whales who need more liquidity to safely unload their assets. I am still in BTC and a lot of other cryptos because this volatility makes day trading very profitable.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:49:21
Truth is that there is one or two key support lines coming up (12.6 and 10k). If these two break, BTC realistically falls to 4-8k. However, people may be less willing to come back this time because mainstream money is getting burned. It may also just be whales trying to trigger stop losses, and we are going back up.
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:09:28
They sell it to exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:20:56
So, is the dropping BTC volatility related to the futures trading? Whales aren't as willing to screw with BTC, as a huge chunks of futures market sells could rip through walls in either direction and make it harder to manipulate markets ATM. This makes more sense, as more volume is moving to alts.
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:30:40
No, volume has dropped markedly last few days.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:38:06
Sure, but huge, real walls, deter sell offs.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:24:05
People who don't understand markets are posting a lot here. Listen, the whales will keep pushing this thing down because they havent reached enough resistance. They want to trigger all of those nice, nice stop losses and gobble them up. Most technical analysis suggested this would be at 11, 8, or 6k. We'll see. Once they've pushed far enough, they will then turn around and push until they've hit enough resistance on the other side. This is what has happened for most of these swings. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:42:16
This is why banks are interested in Ripple.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:14:02
No, Im saying that the swings in both directions are manytimes manipulation by whales. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:22:47
I'm not discussing a preference. I actually like the coin markets, as they are more free. However, no doubt that some of the stuff that happens with crypto doesnt happen in normal commodities markets. If you tried to throw up fake buy orders and wash trade, you'd likely be caught quickly by the CFTC. They watch this, and others would report you.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:40:43
Dudes, I hope all of you who tried to claim that this market wasn't manipulated have seen the light. Whole manipulation by whales drives this show.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:36:51
The low volume makes this very possible, as this is the perfect time for whales to accumulate.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:01:44
The price isn't determined by holders. It is determined by who is willing to buy at a price. If no one wanted to buy at 13k, it would drop even if everyone else held.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:32:28
That could work to DCA down. Just remember that slow bleeds are indicative of a market that still has another drop ahead. The bottom is where you generally have an insane reversal. Another option might be to put tiered conditional buy orders in above the current price, and they will get gobbled on the way up.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:27:43
Dude, watch charts and you'll see the behavior. Some people do treat it as a store of wealth. Many more are speculating.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:48:33
This is just wild to watch. It is crazy when I see all of the "HODL" stuff and rationalization that it isn't a speculative bubble. I'm invested, probably more than many of the late adopters here, but I'm not deluding myself that this isn't a speculative bubble (especially with all of the current "experts" and "projections" coming from laypeople). BTW, prices are determined by traders, not by long-term holders. You guys can all hold out forever for the 100,000 or whatever price, but without buyers, the price drops.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:11:49
Because this is mostly a speculative bubble all the way down to about 1-4k. The other cryptos' entire value is based in the market's faith in Bitcoin at this point (that is how you buy them, by buying BTC first). This is less true for those carried on major exchanges like LTC, ETH, and BCC.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:12:23
So, you truly believe the USD depreciated 10x+ this year?
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:55:14
Bro is telling the truth. I watch markets all day long, and so much wash trading is going on. You'll see a sequence like 8 BTC 2 BTC 1 BTC 2.3 BTC buy, then the same sequence sell. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 12:21:28
I don't think it impacts mining--just CNY-BTC trades and subsequent withdrawals. The mined coins can still be sold on USD exchanges without impacting their currency.
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:18:54
I'm so confused by this post. You understand that the CNY exchanges are on the verge of getting regulated out of business? What is going to happen to the price once the PBOC shuts down the Chinese exchanges and people can no longer invest with CNY at scale?
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:11:31
Sure, and P2P trading will undoubtedly continue. But, the volumes just won't be there like they were before.
@_date: 2017-02-16 10:53:49
Thanks! I think it is hard for people to understand capital controls, and what a fixed exchange rate really means to an average Chinese. They can easily kill 95% of BTC transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:11:40
@_date: 2017-02-16 12:28:31
Currency can't be moved out if that is what you are asking. There are strict controls on CNY leaving the system. Overseas it is a different currency (CNH). You can't withdraw the bitcoin right now from the CNY exchanges, so no opportunity for arbitrage.
@_date: 2017-02-16 23:31:03
Very convincing. If you assume they are acting rationally, this makes sense. I have less faith in organized competency w/the regulator, which is why I believe think their withdrawal policy may not be optimized to accomplish the objectives above. I am doubtful they can establish a withdrawal regulation regime that keeps the behavior in the exchanges (because such a large percentage aims to offshore capital freely, while I agree another large percentage is as a store of wealth hedge against currency fluctuation). If they cap withdrawals at 10 BTC daily or 50 BTC yearly, I think it will still drive enough underground. I am struggling to see an effective withdrawal policy that keeps investors on the exchanges while deterring capital flight.
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:21:56
Interesting, a precedent is in place with payment processers/financial services (i.e., they drove everyone from Alipay to UnionPay). 
They may try the monitored withdrawals, but I don't get how they prevent capital outflow issues (like they've seen with the 蚂蚁搬家 issue where people just secretly group together large piles of RMB that they and 24 family members pool through 50k forex exchanges/person). This would be especially true if Bitcoin prices stabilize.
I guess I just see them being in a bit of difficult spot with the measured withdrawal idea. If they put a cap (say 10 BTC per day), you will just see people trading P2P. This could snowball quickly, especially with the concurrent increase of every other capital control. 
Anyway, your scenario seems very possible, and I think it may be attempted and poorly executed, leading to a huge underground P2P BTC exchange market.
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:58:41
How specifically in China can they invest? The money is held though state-owned or highly regulated banks, I guess you can wire funds to another's account, but it will take away large volume purchases...
@_date: 2017-02-16 09:01:17
I'm surprised they even then let you switch. I guess the government could put some yearly 50k cap w/reporting directly to SAFE. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:19:52
I have been following this issue closely--don't you think that the PBOC is going to kill the CNY exchanges (i.e., no longer allow withdrawals)?
@_date: 2017-02-16 12:16:57
Disagree. China is 10% more in lost currency reserves from economic catastrophe (i.e., businesses can't pay overseas bills). They are closing every capital outflow gap they can. This includes currency reserve neutral exchanges, as this still effects the RMB's value, and tangentially requires them to dump more currency reserves to prop up their currency. They are going to ban or restrict withdrawals, which won't kill P2P transactions, but will absolutely destroy the market.
@_date: 2017-02-16 23:34:42
I think the regulation at issue is BTC withdrawals. You can still deposit BTC and convert to CNY, or if the Exchanges are dead, the will sell for USD and then convert to CNY in China (something the gov wants).
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:10:48
Can you provide actual information to back up your point? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:57:46
Yes, but Bitcoin has such a large subscriber base due to its ability to move around capital controls. It is a means to an end, and will see a big decrease if it can't be used for this purpose. Also, localbitcoins is fine, but can't subsume the market need that the central exchanges provide. Can I switch over 100 BTC in an hour through local Bitcoins? If so, then you may have a point...
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:45:22
It technically doesn't. It would be like changing RMB for a toaster and selling that overseas for USD. But, SAFE wants to regulate all capital outflows, so it would claim that it is (even though you are changing it outside of China.
@_date: 2017-02-16 06:38:37
I do want to give some insight into this issue. Notice that the original statements by the exchanges state that it was for "money laundering" purposes, but have expanded scope to cover "illegal money exchange." Understand that any withdrawal of Bitcoin can be used to circumvent the "illegal money exchange" rules. This means that eventually, all withdrawals will be highly regulated or not allowed altogether. The Chinese formal bitcoin exchanges will die, mark my words, there is no other way if the PBOC's SAFE makes the decision to regulate. GET YOUR MONEY OUT.
@_date: 2017-01-14 10:08:43

@_date: 2017-01-14 11:24:45
Do you transfer it to a different exchange to do USD exchange, or do you exchange on their USD exchange? Is there any difference? The reason I ask is that I know someone who wants to do a huge 50+BTC exchange, and then quickly shift, and wants as little variability as possible.
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:29:14
Hasn't China already really taken out Bitcoin liquidity in their country. Don't all of the exchanges now have 10 BTC daily limits on transfer or withdrawal?
@_date: 2017-01-14 10:09:05

Guys, I don't come over here much. I usually am in the trading subreddits. However, please don't act irrationally here. We may have reached a local bottom. However, if this looks like it will get worse (e.g., breaking 8.5 and 8.2), please don't just HODL. There are many ways to preserve your gains, including taking a portion out of cold storage and shorting, or maybe just selling to fiat until it clears out if you can't/won't short.

Guys, it will go sub-3000 (if we are lucky, may be 1k). I'm not saying it will not go back up to 100k, and buying the dip here is a bad long-term strategy. But you can't extrapolate based upon the BTC bull markets and not also recognize how far down this thing goes in bear markets.

Yes, this may be the right thing. Look at our trend. Sell the "bump" (kind of like buying the dip), and then wait for it to bottom out (you can even stagger buy orders above the current price, but lower than you sold at). Then you are guaranteed more coins than you have right now.

Literally is probably similar psychology to people drinking the cyanide-laced Kool-Aid, and wholly irrational. "Well, I'm in this far, better keep going, people are telling me this will lead to a good outcome because of their experiences" 
Seriously, if you really are one of those "I want to own as many coins as possible" people, just create a Bitmex account and start shorting BTC now, then you can have more when this is done. 
If you are one of those "shit, I lost a ton of $$$ in BTC" people, then try some leveraged trading and play the 15 min BB and other indicators to dig your way out. 
This market is ripe to short and swing trade right now. For many of us, it is basically the same feeling you guys had when BTC went from 8k to 20k.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:52:05

@_date: 2018-02-02 19:18:19
What? The order books on GDAX, Finex, and others combined lost like 15k BTC support here before the drop. Why would there be more support now?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:25:01
It is still risky, but the price usually moves pretty well between certain indicators (e.g., the 20/80 RSI, or the 15 minute Bollinger Bands). This is because so much of the trading is done by leveraged traders and bots who are all keyed in on these indicators. They really only work differently when something crazy happens (e.g., Italy bans BTC and you are already at the low indicators). So, a great way to play this market is to simply trade the high and low indicators.  
For example, one way to do it is to just wait for BTC to drop down to like 0 or -5 BB then buy in with 10 leverage on a long, or conversely, wait until it is scraping the High BB and go short.

Guys, we all love crypto, it is great for trading, and the volatility has made us a lot of $$$. However, just realize that nearly all of the value in BTC is speculation and gambling. No one actually cares about utility. But for whales with huge holdings, this could go to less than $1.
Much of the price action is driven by activities illegal in regulated markets (wash trading, loading the order book, etc.), and you are experiencing the consequences of these  actions right now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:13:04
Guys remember, that you can still get out of this and save some money. Sure, you can't "call the bottom," but if you think this will go lower than 9k, then sell now and put a moving limit order below the price you sold at. For example, sell at 9k, and when it drops to 8.5, put an order at 8.75, when it drops to 7.5, put an order at 7.75, etc. If the market does rebound, you get more coins than if you hold now. You could triple your coin stash if you sell now and buy back in at 3k!

Sure, because they have a risk premium. Buying crypto is a way around paying the cash advance premium (because you can cash back out).

Crypto investment is not significant compared to the amount of investment in the stock market
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:23:02
LOL, true. So, probably more like charging your card at some offshore online casino.

*Whales and trading bots.

I can't tell if a lot of these "HODL"ers are aspie, immoral, or crazy. No rational person would advise people to keep their funds in the market in a situation like we are in now (unless they don't care about others and are just in it for themselves). I saw this one dude on the trading sub advising his friends to put their entire college savings for their kids in at 11k. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:41:47
Dude, you need a ton of money to buy this back up. The retail buyers are out. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:29:52
TBF, the technology works as well at 50 dollars. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:39:01
LOL. Yeah, "HMMM, Wall Street friends, let's invest in Bitcoin. Sure, it just dropped 80%, but I'm sure it will go up."
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:43:12
Lol, the fact that people think the chance is to escape really reflects how likely a recovery is at this point.
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:09:32
Guys, you can't blame them. They are all trying to get out of Dodge before this thing drops into the abyss. They see the writing on the wall, and don't want to be held responsible for promoting a something that leaves 95% of people fucked. 
I'm not saying that will be how it ends up long-term, it may be that healthy growth and adoption occur. Right now though interest is dropping, and the price is literally propped up by leveraged longs on Bitmex and whales wash trading and spoofing (both illegal activities in many places). This is recipe for short-term disaster. Leveraged longs by ordinary investors and order book manipulation have been banned in places like the U.S. because they led to the great depression. This is literally what happened--ignorant rubes got in huge trouble borrowing to speculate, then the whales of the day went in to prop up the instruments and manipulate the price once it started falling and BAM! depression. Also, I'm not saying gov. regulation or paternalism is the answer, but these conditions are what precipitated the Great Depression.

Dude, if everyone gambling pulled out, the price would be like $50.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:37:55
Dude, are you joking. Maybe you should sit out "investing" if you don't understand what stocks are backed by. They are backed by a whole hell of a lot more than BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:34:36
Sure, but so was the Zune. Worked better than the iPod. Didn't matter. Now a joke in Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:10:36
Dude, there is no way it corrects out with the tiny bounce we've seen. There will be bounces like this daily on the way down.
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:37:09
I see people saying stuff like "short squeeze." However, based upon the [data]( shorts are really low right now, and longs are very high. They are like 1.5x above where they were at market peak. Why this is bad news is that they have been piling up for the last few days FOLLOWING the rebound, and haven't closed. However, usually this would result in a commensurate raise in prices. It has not, it has been sold into heavily. If we drop another 500 or so, we will start seeing a catapult effect downward due to long squeeze. Thereafter, shorts will kick back down and push it lower.
The key is for BTC to go over about 8800. If not, this could become apocalyptic quickly. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:34:11
Guys, serious question. If you were a whale, and could make money in either direction (shorting downward AND then buying coins at like 1-3k, or pushing upward and cashing out), and your moves were based wholly on which group was easier to push, which would you choose?
Remember when it was going up, and the sentiment in here? Can you see the sentiment now? 
A rebound won't come until people are easier to push upwards than downwards.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:32:19
Traders aren't gone. I'm a trader. If anything, this is when you make $$$$$ shorting the market with leverage. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:58:06
Not at all. The price isn't reflective of utility, especially in crypto markets, where 98% is speculation and gambling. Would BTC have more utility at a set 2k, or constantly fluctuating in the 10ks?
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:57:23
I mean, this doesn't mean a lot until we cross probably 13k. However, I am back with leverage on the bull side for awhile.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:16:25
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:18:34
Wait to buy for another few weeks, buy-in when the price is 3k or less.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:40:30
What is your target price?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:41:37
Also an incredible way to make mad $$$ on shorting and swing trading with medium leverage.
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:18:48
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:21:28
Maybe? I think most people who got burned were retail people who don't know how to short/what a short is at all. Traders are making $$$ right now. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:05:19
Just go to cryptowat.ch this is the best.
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:06:37
LOL, this is such a bubble still. All of the "paradigm is different this time!!!!" stuff convinces me we are going to 1-3k conservatively. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:24:31
What the hell is this post? Of course some TA has use. It is crazy and uninformed to lump all of it together as "meaning nothing." It helps to identify resistance, channels, and consolidation. It isn't some witchcraft that helps you divine which direction the market will go, but is very useful for risk management. Using tools like Bollinger Bands, EMAs, RSI, volume, etc. will help you identify likelihood of the direction of a market move, as well as the intensity of a particular move. 
I think the people here are just butthurt that we are in a bear market, and traders are making off well, while hodlers are screwed.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:25:37
Much of the time it happens it is wash trading. The guy is trying to generate market sentiment (in this case to move it upward, just to accumulate and short). 
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:10:41
Problem is that we don't know if we will see an ATH again. BTC is a highly speculative investment without clear, definable value. It could be that BTC is Apple or Microsoft during the downturn, and it will eventually return to its ATH but take 17 years. It could be that BTC is Excite, which is now worthless. It could be that BTC will moon like people think. 
Who knows? I would say buying now could be rational--maybe we have a 20% chance of going to 100k, so you are buying an equivalent of $20,000 value at $6.8k. 
However, please, please, please don't listen to the people that say "every bubble it has recovered at X growth rate, this will be the same." It takes a hell of a lot more capital and interest to drive up a price to 20k than from $100 to $1000. Enthusiast interest can drive the price up to a lower point, but you have to convince the plumbers and Uber drivers and MLM moms who got burned at 18k to come back.
