No worries man, we need some to spend - hopefully with merchants that save bitcoin like I mentioned.

I totally agree, and you should be happy I am part of this ecosystem, instead of calling people whiny. 
Perhaps you don't understand the point i'm trying to make.  Adoption will happen, it is happening, no one can stop it. Economic pressure of frictionless money and basically no fees will eat away at every other expensive means of exchange indefinitely.

I wondered this..
@_date: 2014-09-28 20:45:06
We don't need a light bulb, we have **candles**.
We don't need the telephone, we got the **telegraph**.
We don't need email, we have **snail mail**.
We don't need Bitcoin, we have the **dollar**.
Bitcoin will naturally replace a good share of (or all) the demand for the dollar, and it doesn't need our opinion on the matter. Anyone that thinks otherwise does not understand the **dollar**, not bitcoin.

Ok, then from a personal example... when my BTC shot up to $1000+ I purchased a few things I wanted, and wouldnt otherwise if the price didn't go up that high. Right now I am not spending... if bitcoin were $10,000 each I would be spending.

@_date: 2014-10-01 19:41:15
Hrmmm, nope. 
I'm saying saving will have the biggest effect on price -- not spending, not dumping, not buying more, not trying to get rich and scamming some other poor sucker. 
Spending and replenishing is a GREAT idea and would correct the problem of the merchant dumping the coin. Thats what I do as well, when I have the $ to do so that is...
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:42:12
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:11:10
I'm just saying, people want more transactions (top posts on the homepage)... that will happen naturally when price rises.

anddddd.... its gone.
@_date: 2014-10-01 18:14:55
This would be true for some, but untrue for others. Those that bought BTC at $10 have spent a lot more than those that bought at $1000. Pure economics would state the more valuable the bitcoin, the more people are enticed to spend it. The market will always find an equilibrium, which is where the the price is now. SPENDING bitcoin on merchants that sell for $ will always drive down the price, hence the last few months.
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:37:22
I couldn't agree more. Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:53:30
Price increases spending faster than dumping bitcoins (by spending with non saving merchants).. charts prove this.

@_date: 2015-01-28 20:55:45
12% fee on what price? The lowest exchange? The one you have to wire money across the globe for ~$40 and then hope they credit your account? Or the one that wants all your personal information including DL and bank account info? The real price of bitcoin is not the lowest exchange rate, is what you can get bitcoins in your hand (err wallet) for. 
Go try to get someone on LocalBitcoins to meet up with you for under 10% of the lowest exchange. It's not very often or convenient, and supply is very limited. 
By the time you take out the fees and operations costs, it's probably ~5% profit. 
If you don't agree with the fee, don't use it... simple solution. Go buy bitcoins for cash somewhere else (if you can).

more expensive: Who will end up paying for the infrastructure if there is no reward?

@_date: 2015-09-01 14:24:52
For a merchant, 100%. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:14:39
This is retarded, they don't even have my order as PENDING! It just looks like the order didnt go through and I lost my BTC. Not cool GYFT! (still waiting)
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:33:51
Wow thanks for adding us! We offer 10% off ANY order with coupon code "BITCOIN" for any [HaloRig Video Camera Stabilizer @ HaloRig.com](

No doubt between 0 and 13ish million... 
@_date: 2015-09-01 14:25:47
There is no risk to the merchant to ship their product after payment is made. Even if that means to Nigeria. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:04:39
lol, downvote a real need.
@_date: 2015-09-01 14:29:36
Yes, bitcoin as a whole is expensive. The great thing is since so many people support it, it's cheap. Many hands make light work. 
Free tx are not recommended, in the future they likely won't be processed?
But again I am saying from the MERCHANT side bitcoin costs me nothing, as the sender pays the tx fee. 
Also miners are rewarded by a chance of winning a new 25 btc... thats not a direct expense for a user. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:22:25
For 1) the tx cost is incurred by the sender, not the merchant. 
2) that you didn't calculate the 2.9% on top of the fixed tx fee. 
ie. $162 would cost me ~$5 via paypal. Bitcoin would cost me nothing....
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:43:50
Hang in there, more will come! We've had a few over at [HaloRig Camera Stabilizers](
With a 10% off "BITCOIN" coupon, it makes a great way to seal the deal.
@_date: 2015-03-28 01:51:11
e-commerce software will usually track IPs, to thwart malicious orders I suppose. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 20:58:57
Right on, thanks! 
Back to the OP: No, bitcoin's USP is much larger than combating arbitrary minimums set by small retailers. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:20:05
hence why I said it.

His youtube site was DELETED after this video, thankfully restored after a public outcry... one of the best speeches!
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:44:11
@_date: 2015-03-28 01:40:29
Sure, the HaloRig Mini is designed for DSLRs!  Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2015-03-02 06:06:30
And..... it's gone.
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:22:17
I'll do it...
@_date: 2015-03-30 12:05:28
His response...
Max Keiser:  **Jealousy looks ugly, doesn't it?**
@_date: 2015-03-19 03:06:13
Start up a BTM, there is obviously a demand that is not being met in your area! 
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:22:08
I'd be up for the challenge... 
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:21:33
more sales is more risk with this guys 2+2=5 logic. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 20:35:51
Wow, thanks again for your support! Enjoy your HaloRig and let us know if there is anything else we can help with.
@_date: 2015-02-19 00:35:57
I know I haven't seen a way to access that data, have you?

@_date: 2015-02-19 01:32:52
Only last 29 transactions perhaps?

Because volatility.

How did this post even get upvotes? 
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:20:25
Who cares. Bitcoin regulates Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-29 20:53:38
sorry... USP? 
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:06:50
It's likely a set # of transactions, not date... so for some its not so long.
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:02:16
They responded to us as well, no time frame..

Thanks, and wow I'll have to show her, these are right up her alley. Can't see why they wouldn't make the registry. :D
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:19:48
I really am just curious...
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:39:20
Awesome and much appreciated! Let me know if they have any questions..
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:53:21
Dang is right.....
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:43:47
I appreciate it! I as well always look for BTC options... I've already spent a bit of BTC on advertising HaloRig recently as well as other personal items. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:19:16
Americans are smart, buying back in lower.... 
Pfff. riiight.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:07:39
:( 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:32:37
Thanks for the tips and feedback! :D We really are working on more options for the HaloRig like you described, they are all valid points. 
We hope to improve our product over time but right now it would be very difficult to fund that R&amp;D of milling and marketing new features. 
We wont give up, thanks for your support. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:18:50
This post should be removed then: 
1200+ upvotes really sends the wrong message to small businesses like myself with titles like "So someone told me if I accept bitcoins on my website, I get free advertising/upvotes from you guys?". 
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:20:54
Thanks for your support :D 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:38:22
I agree with you that most won't need one, but does that go hand and hand with supporting it? 
These days an iPhone can even be attached to our camera stabilizer, seems like it should get a little traction with techies like ourselves. 
I really just wanted some love, support and hopefully the word will spread to people that could use them..
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:44:33
Thanks, and we will keep chugging along! I see the fire on the horizon :)
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:34:57
Could earn you a tip or 20 if translated, depends on the article though. It good? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:55:07
Upvotes greatly appreciated! We look forward to serving the bitcoin community with quality products this holiday season! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:19:33
Localbitcoins.com - done. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:40:44
Thanks, awesome to hear, confidence booster for sure :D
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:26:38
Thank you!! ahhhh I'm a noob... need to figure out how these work..
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:39:42
Thanks for the support either way! 
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:37:22
Oh no, I will look into that.. it has been loading slow, I think the host is overloaded lately. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:22:19
Everyone that didn't buy BTC at 30€ lost :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:36:47
Thank you vbenes, mighty nice of you!
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:38:17
Right on, thank you sir.
I've learned a lot from my few posts on reddit and its all grately appreciated. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:29:50
Awesome, it is in both accounts.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:23:22
Ah, I was mistaken but it won't be long before it does... It is right on Discover's heals: 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:25:05
I will do this, thanks for the tip!!
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:14:05
Well articulated, and appreciated! I know there is a little bad with the good so I won't let it get to me too much.. 
I am new to reddit, so far feels like walking through troll island, lol. 
Don't forget about your hobbies, I been shooting for over 10 years as a hobby which led me to designing the HaloRig. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:46:45
Good points, I appreciate your insight.  :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:30:24
He is captivating... listen to all, follow none. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:01:40
So why do We not get the bitcoin communities support as its advertised here? 
We are a small business and really would appreciate any support you can send our way!
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:26:36
Soon my brother, soon bitcoin will pass Visa and MC - already passed discover! We are on the right side of things. Best of luck!
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:21:03

Thank you so much :D
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:57:32
Yeah, I'm with you. We have had quite a few "checkout" but practically all of them have yet to actually initiate payment. We did get our 1st BTC sale yesterday :D
Link to your Crystal? The fiancé and I are in the market actually. 
Hang in there, I've been trying to convince your demographic for a while now and finally their ears are starting to perk up. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:05:12
We advertised on BitcoinBlackFriday.com, I would like to see their data as well... 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:35:59
Thanks for sharing! :D
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:32:56
Lets hope so, Schiff is all about a gold backed digital currency at this point.. not going to work.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:46:25
Did you expect the truth from the MSM?
It's doing what its designed to do. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:32:30
You're awesome! 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:37:17
Thank you very much :D
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:03:05
Don't tell anyone but  will be running the same special all weekend.. $40 off instantly, free gear and additional 10% off any bitcoin purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:36:09
Ooooooooooo ;)
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:08:58
I think I signed up... anything else I have to do?
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:31:36
there is also one about halfway through as well... regarding bitcoin being a movement of the people to naturally/progressively decentralize.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:39:25
Grab a 2.5 HD to USB like this: 
Remove the old drive, use adapter to plug into your working computer, then copy the wallet.dat file over to say your desktop.
Load it up by backing up your existing wallet.bat (assuming you already have bitcoin-qt installed), renaming it and loading the new wallet.bat in its place... and then send it to your cold wallet asap. 20 BTC shouldn't stay on any computer online...
Dont use a 3rd party unless this doesnt work and the hard drive is broken.

Doh, I was in advertising for too long I guess lol. I tend to agree as this post gained much more attention.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:32:58
We purchased advertising in BTC that we are accepting BTC!

Saw it was re-posted by BitcoinNe.ws - 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:47:36
I hear ya, thanks for the feedback! 
HaloRig has been selling for fiat for a while now, and we give our fair share to the banks (paypal). I know bitcoin will come around, guess I was optimistic about the ability to accept bitcoin a little early.
