95% threshold for activation is not very conducive to adaptability.  It heavily favors the status quo.

Their influence is far more than just an opinion.  I agree that they do good work, but it also seems they're creating solutions to problems they're creating.  What exactly is the argument against a dynamic limit?  Why is a 1mb limit necessary? 
I hope they do have good intentions for the network, not solely to monetize it for their employer.  
Don't be upset about my criticisms.  These things need to be talked about.
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:47:02
I don't see how changing to a dynamic limit would be such a terrible thing.  The market would then decide the limit, not a cartel of programmers who are invested in keeping the block limit at 1 mb.

@_date: 2016-03-25 20:28:16
I concur with everything you said.  Dynamic limit is what we should be talking about to reduce future bickering. 
I still don't like the Blockstream involvement, though.  Too many corruptible forces in play.  Segwit is not a fix.  It kicks the inevitable can down the road.
@_date: 2016-03-27 13:26:40
Who said anything about 2 mb?  Other devs are willing to but the "roadmap" is in control by a select few.  Maybe you should unilaterally quit and hand the blockchain over to those who want to see it grow on-chain.

There are newer offerings that can do all these things that bitcoin can do minus the wider adoption.  Why should we stick to the MySpace of coins?  Emotion?
I love me some bitcoin as much as every other guy.  I'm all for a decentralized future. However, if the miners keep stalling to prop up fees, people will eventually divest and move on to another coin.
Personally, I think the 95% activation threshold is going to kill bitcoin.  Getting people to agree at that threshold is not going to happen unless it completely favors the miners.

I don't think 95% activation will happen.  Not silly, but realistic.  Other cryptos are beginning to eat Bitcoin's lunch.  Its niche may be digital gold, nothing more.  
No need to call names. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:41:05
I was being a bit dramatic, but it is a problem that no one is really working on solving.  Even if they fork once, the possibility is still there that it can happen again and again.  Nobody seems to be looking that far forward.  Too much power for the miners and not enough for the users.  Don't buy or sell based on what anyone says.  Do your own research and learn about the tech.   Otherwise, you'll get played. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:31:52
Bitcoin is a failed experiment.  There have been fears of centralized mining for a long time and now it's becoming a more present danger.  Neither side realizes shits broken. Both sides think they can fix it, but they cant until they can figure out how to fix mining centralization.

Still works for me.  Better than crashing the network and turning mining into a new banking system.

Agreed, it is an innovation and a much needed one, but it's usefulness has trade-offs.  What kind of Koolaid aid are you sipping on?   It adds centralized processors back into the equation.  You need to consider that we will need more than one scaling solution to solve the problems we have, not just sprinkling your one solution fairy dust on it.
@_date: 2016-06-30 08:28:08
"Negligible scaling benefit.". Trying to understand how giving a 100%  increase in scaling is negligible, please point me in the direction of a scaling solution that does that.  While I appreciate the work out into Segwit, it doesn't even scale at a 100% increase.  I suspect you meant "maximal scaling benefit."

Fair enough, I understand. I just don't like the idea that the block size is something that anybody should have power over.   It's causing a lot of division in the community and pushing users and devs elsewhere.

Dynamic blocksize, not unlimited.  More transactions with lower fee.  More transactions equals more fees collected for miners, not less.  We could set up 250K block size and charge a shit ton for a fee.  Miners would still get paid but only a few people would be able to afford bitcoin.  I should just use my bank if it's gonna cost me that much.

You can copy and paste code from Bitcoin to another coin with a lower threshold.  
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:54:32
Not saying THEY give up.  The soft  forks may never activate at which point some other devs of another coin or altcoin or whatever can utilize it in their coin.  My argument is not about any specific coin, in general,  but more about the really high threshold for change.  I don't find it conducive to staying ahead of the pack.
@_date: 2017-01-16 03:48:40

Except that they wouldn't need to if blocks were bigger.
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:04:10
I think people would move on to a new cryptocurrency.  95% is way too high of a threshold.  If it can't evolve, it will be replaced, IMHO.  Probably not a popular viewpoint here.  People don't like criticism of things they're heavily invested in.

Not sure why miners would want to move transactions off-chain as would be the case with Segwit.  Using LN and sidechains would reduce the amount of fees miners would be able to collect in comparison to the fees from on-chain scaling.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

Reddit for 1 week is right, though.  All the pure PoW coins are manipulated and controlled by a small group of people.  Is it going to take 3 to 4 years to push every upgrade through?  PoW coins will stagnate.  
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:27:58

I'd watch it.  Well, I suppose I already am, but I'd watch it again if they did a decent job casting.
@_date: 2017-04-14 16:05:11
A sensible compromise requiring a HF when it is not necessary.  I think your the one not being sensible.  We can add blocksize later, if needed. Soft fork Segwit first.
@_date: 2017-04-20 14:16:36
I think your analogy supports his statement.  It is just technology, which is agnostic to politics, people's feelings, etc.  Bitcoin can be used mailiciously.

P.S.  Your miners will come slightly used.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:44:44

What do fees have to do with Segwit activating?  You aren't even making sense anymore.
@_date: 2017-04-14 17:51:19
You are exactly right.  This is why we need off-chain options.
All in all, I could set some QOS rules on my router or control the amount of connections on my node, but the point is that we can't just keep increasing the blocksize without consequence.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:29:42
Agree.  The governance is fucked.  Just wait until Bitmain controls the code.
@_date: 2017-04-22 00:40:48
Upgrading to Segwit went through the same process that all other upgrades before Segwit went through to be included in the code.  Literally, nothing has changed.  More than 75% of blocks will need to signal to activate.  All of a sudden, you claim the coin is centralized.  FUD.
@_date: 2017-04-23 01:16:35
UASF is going to have to be the route for Bitcoin.  Getting 95% of miners to agree on shit is not going to be doable in this political climate.  I don't care who says that it's a feature that protects Bitcoin.  I can't think of a better way to slow down evolution of crypto.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:06:26
Core didn't do nothing.  It provided Segwit which is scaling without a HF.
@_date: 2017-04-21 22:04:03
Bitcoin Unlimited is malware.  You should be more careful.

Does this make Charlie Litestream Core?
@_date: 2017-04-05 23:07:54
So a HF is an intermediate measure compared to Segwit? 
@_date: 2017-04-14 16:02:40
My node produces about 200 GB of traffic in/out per month.  I have a bandwidth cap of 300 GB.  If we increase the blocksize to 2MB, well, you do the math.  
If I can't run my own node, then I'm back to trusting a third party for my transactions.  Essentially, a bank could do that same for me at that point.
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:08:52

Jihan is making a very good case for hybridized consensus coins.  Pure PoW is looking like a failed experiment turning miners into the new bankers.  China will soon control Jihan/Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:55:39
No, I got the point.  Miners have always had control.  These are PoW coins.  Technology doesn't give a fuck about your feelings, moon, or anything else.  You can choose to put your money elsewhere if you don't like it, but miners have a say in this.
I don't like it that way either, but BTC will stay the same if it can't come to consensus.  LTC has found consensus.  The miners and users now agree.
@_date: 2016-09-25 17:35:10

I wouldn't ask you to apologize.  Just making you aware.
@_date: 2016-10-09 15:41:28
Right.  Because Segwit is the only possible answer to malleability.
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:28:49

Sale price - purchase price = capital gain/loss
It gets a bit more confusing when your two currencies deep.  You have to pay gains on LTC buy and sell and also BTC buy and sell when going back to fiat, but not the BTC you made from trading LTC as you already paid the gains in the form of LTC gains.  
The websites I provided elsewhere in this post allows you to upload your transactions from Coinbase, Circle, Polo, Bittrex, GDAX, etc. and calculates it for you.  If you only made a couple trades, the cointracking website is free up to a certain amount of trades.
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:42:11
Don't forget shorter block times and 4 times the capacity!  I guess those could be argued as bad things though.
@_date: 2016-05-23 19:20:01
Not sure if read my comment or...
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:26:08
Now we're going to play coy?  How about answering the question instead of ridiculing my argument.
This is how the banks are going to try to control crypto.  Hop into the market with a innocent crypto.  Pump it to create interest.  Let it grow until the layman can no longer support the network/ run a node.  Control the protocol and the 'printing' once everyone is squeezed out.  Back to having fiat, but now in digital form.
EDIT:  Forgot to mention the lack of fungibility.  In essence, we're in worse off shape than fiat.

Centrally controlled protocol.  They can do what they want.
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:28:26
If you are in the U.S.,  I've used these:
-better for just small Bitcoin trades (free)
-if you trade a lot of crypto (free up to a certain amount of trades)
You have to report all gains in the U.S. so as someone said already, if you made $0.50 or above, you have to report it.
EDIT: It would seem the first link isn't in https according to my browser, so yea, be careful.
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:39:26
So really the users really won't have a vote on how the protocol is implemented if the network grows large enough that people can't run nodes?  Or how much XRP will be created or fees or anything?  So really, the only improvement that it has on other alts is maybe transaction time, although some other alts are already instant.  How does it improve on existing tech?  How will the network improve?  Do you just have to put your trust in Ripple Inc. for software upgrades?
@_date: 2017-05-08 10:53:08
Haha.  I love you could-of-bot. Cold and calculated.
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:48:06
So it's a property (captial asset) that you have to pay tax on if you realize any gains.
@_date: 2016-05-21 13:34:17

I turned off my router and windows firewall to see if that was the problem, but it still says my node is unreachable.  Anyone else familiar with this or want to help me out?  
P.S. I'm not the most computer literate person, but pretty damn proud I made it this far.  
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:07:04
That's assuming people will be able to run nodes once the network grows.  If it becomes centralized, Ripple/banks will then control the path.
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:00:22
I agree, it may be hard to determine the exact algorithm to govern the size, but I think it would be better to try than to let this fractured, bickering community fester.  It is not impossible to do and once set would hopefully end this problem for good.

Tired of hearing about CSW, wish people would just move forward.  How's Segwit coming along?
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:41:45
I wasn't arguing for creating Bitcoin blocks; I was asking how it improves on anything already in the crypto space.  
Open source doesn't mean anything if the protocol is controlled by a small amount of people due to centralization.  You can write code all day and no one will use it if it.   Upgrades to the existing network will have to go through centralized authorities, especially when/if the network does get to 1000 tx/s.  This will end up as mutable, censored transactions no different from credit cards/banks.  Not that it's a bad thing to some people, but not too interesting for me as I have a credit card and bank account already.

Core thinks it can control miners. Lol.  Good luck with that.

TIL centralized payment channels aren't centralized.  Fancy that.

I would if I weren't a caveman.  I have a AT&amp;T modem/router and can't get the ports open.  Thank you for being awesome though.

We're still at the same scale that Bitcoin started with.
