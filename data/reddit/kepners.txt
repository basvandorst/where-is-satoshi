Dude. Bitcoin ship sailed for the average 5 years or more ago. Christ have you only just heard of bitcoin because it was on the news?
@_date: 2019-07-11 07:03:55
I think all the dates are wrong on this. Why did I waste my time
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:38:30
Is paypal a bank? I suppose your right only difference is you are also a bank aswell.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:42:05
Pleaseeeee. ..... love this.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:24:05
No its not. What does this mean for bitcoin as the price is so high. How will it actually be used.?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:19:56
Becuase one day in the future if you keep your coins in say.... freewallet or coinbase they will give you crypto loans... just like Saltcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:28:37
Haha ! Very funny.

Dude come on. He wants his son to have fun.
@_date: 2014-12-20 11:28:00
That is the reason why.

I got my shit of criptsy thanks to reddit about 2months ago. However I have lost 4 bitcoins to the blockchain wallet app... I changes mobile phone and had to get a nano sim... When I went back to the old phone to transfer the coins over it didn't work and wanted to me to start a new wallet... My 4 coins gone.
@_date: 2016-01-09 16:31:15
Dude to the fact I was unaware that linking a phone number and email to an app requires fucking backing up. Thanks. I am now aware that any fucking bitcoins service is bullshit as ur still on your own becuase as you said you didn't back up. I had for the record backed up my own btc wallet but I got fed up of having to update the blockchain... 7gb was too much. It was this reason I went to an app.
@_date: 2019-11-18 19:30:53
Dude. The price at the start of the year was $4000 and it's now at $8/9000 dollar. Ok it's not the high levels of 2017, get some perspective. Only 4 years ago it was 500/1000 dollars...
@_date: 2017-01-29 21:45:16
Good job man. The under cover security fucking need to leave people alone. Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:08:15
Yup. And lost them to rouge fucking shitty hardware companies and shitty wallet apps, yea looking at you 'blockchain' yea fuck you guys FFFFUUUUU.
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:51:14
The best part, is no oversight so if zucky or one of his zucky mates take a dislike you, then it will be away with your zuckz. 
This will suck like youtube demontizing your uploads.

Don't listen to the advise that you have free BCH because you only got them if you had your coins in a wallet that supported BCH aswell as BTC. Not many did, I spent awhile finding the correct wallet for me.
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:04:20
Who is ignorant?
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:38:37
I found mine in the kettle.
Edit: fffffuuuuu phone.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:44:55
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:56:56
No. I did it, you needed the coins in the wallets that supported BCH. Loads of the popular wallets didn't support it. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:46:35
Unless you use Blockchain app and they will steal your coins by updating the app to delete all the information and have to start a new wallet. I have lost 4.6 coins. Fuck you Blockchain. Fuck you jade at Blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:30:49
Yes. I was told I should have backed up the wallet. To which I said that is why I'm using your fucking app...
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:48:29
Nope. Makes fuck all difference if you use Blockchain. They will just update the app and delete your shit and you loose everything... They will then tell you, that you should have cold stored the coins.... Fuck you Blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:45:17
That's exactly what happened. Blockchain is the worst app.

Who? I am in the UK. Who would I report them to? I mean what proof do I have because transfered most of them from cryptsy...

Thank you..moved them to freewallet... Talk about a delay. Still haven't arrived 2hours later
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:38:31
I still do not understand. I have 1btc with coinbase does this mean i have one btc and one bcc? If so where do i get this bcc
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:31:18
THe evidence is lacking on this statement.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:07:40
ok. I sent 4bitcoins. To me it was two blocks of two btc's??
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:04:45
yes. its 0.0001 fee charged.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:08:31
i dont have 100. i had 10. now i have 9.9999....
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:02:48
I used the one on the android App.
am i to assume that the wallet isnt legit?
Also, this app is on the bitcoin website and nowhere on there or on the APP does it mention a fee.
