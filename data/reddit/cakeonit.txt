Richard heart has some very good ideas, but he is definitely not one to follow for timing BTC price.  
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:56:37
This.  Every time I see Richard Heart I wonder about his head rest and pillows.  Does he have neck issues?  
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:06:42
That would be ideal, but unfortunately my tenants are old school, no one in my neck of the woods knows about BTC.  Plus, I'm in NY where the only way to buy is Coinbase.   Coinbase already banned me and won't even let me reopen my account!
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:21:42
The reason to go with RSK/rootstock is because of the BTC blockchain.   Too much uncertainty around the ETH blockchain going forward.  Who knows when ETH is going to fork AGAIN, but it will before BTC does.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:37:12
The biggest fear I have is not the loss in value of BTC, as I actually hope it crashes so I can buy in at lower levels.  My fear is losing the monthly income loss.  My goal now is to amass at least 20-25 BTC for retirement, over 20 years from today.  I am ready to lose money in BTC, but I am more confident in BTC long term than any of my other investments on that time frame.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:38:25
I really hope the testnet works out and people shift to RSK/rootstock from ETH.

Does anyone have this artwork to store BTC as a cold wallet? 
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:34:56
I just saw it was 193,000 transaction.  I know the number is meaningless due to spam though
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:18:17
If only I had done this the last time I sold a rental property I would be so much closer to my retirement goal!

I just love the "fuck your mother if you want fuck" meme, and the rare pepe
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:45:58
I remember and miss those days, if not (at least one of)those guys...
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:24:21
Its at 165,000+ unconfirmed transactions now
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:31:04
Yup, that's pretty much what I was thinking.  I was going to in on Sunday Morning but alas did not have my check until Monday morning.  So today hurt as I watched that green candle grow to near ATH.  FOMO came.  
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:23:05
That is good news, I think...
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:47:05
220ooo unconfirmed transactions and growing, even with these fees there a lot of spam
@_date: 2017-05-12 04:18:23
I was watching the unconfirmed transactions on blockchain.info ( and soo many seem legit, but its going so fast I can't see the little ones that are spam...
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:59:05
My question exactly...
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:57:29
Etherium is just a platform for scamcoins, but it is a good short term buy
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:42:28
Please activate Segwit!  This sucks ass.
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:22:41
Indeed, a lesson I have learned too many times.  I am a terrible trader, and have no luck and few brains.  But, do I buy now or wait?
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:49:58
Correction.  Went to US Fiat!
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:35:53
So I should have bought more on the Segwit Rumors and FUD, and sold this evening with the BIP91 signal met.  I screwed up in that case.  But now, wait until after the fact (Segwit Lockin) and buy again?  I'm getting confused.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:24:39
Looking at this post again, looks like he wasn't an idiot after all.  I just hope he took some profits above 2500 to pay that mortgage for a few years.
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:43:23
Yea, I sold off exchange privately, but am always watchful of our Uncle Sam
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:27:46
I love what Bitcoin is, its just a psychological thing for me...I hate to see the paper loss.  I have been long BTC for four years, but had to pay some major bills short term and had to literally break the seal on a cold wallet of 5BTC.  But yes, I deserve the abuse.  
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:12:46
I am in a similar boat, and I am having two friends do 2K buys for me.  My problem is that I had to pay bills, sold last week (4BTC) and now want to get back in the market, my timing really sucks.  I watched the price bottom last Sunday morning to 1800 and was so pissed I couldn't buy.  
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:14:33
Who has been telling me to HODL?  I don't remember hearing you tell me that.  I don't remember asking last month.  But yea, I'm just fucking with you.  I have heard.
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:16:58
Yes, I wake up wanting a price dip, but it never comes.  I'm in cash and trying to get back into the market.  I want low BTC price for the next year and it just aint happening, except when I have to pay major bills and can't buy BTC.  
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:45:15
Generally a good long term policy really.  Always convert at once.
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:41:35
So waiting I am.  Anxiety in the meantime.  Got off Xanax last year, don't need to go there again; timing crypto can create a bezo abuse issue if you are not disciplined.  
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:52:55
I think this is what I'm going to execute on.  My goal is to get at least 21 BTC, however long it takes.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:27:23
Another lesson why you should never hold any BTC on 3rd party apps that you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:12:38
My allocation would be 80% BTC, 10% S&amp;P, 5% Metals, 5% Alts
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:02:08
IE dollar cost average back in
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:14:23
Bitcoin Jesus?  He would spread FUD and hold Jihans table on his back.  
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:37:45
OK, when to convert this fiat to bitcoins?  Now or wait?  
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:49:23
So exab, would you wait for lower with 10-12K USD on hand, and if so look for what level? Or buy in anticipation (rumor of Segwit problems)
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:51:23
I posted in Twitter that I feel like having woke up after joined Bitconnect, I feel like I had a dirty one night stand. 
But...I realize that I also got married to them for 299 days lol.  
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:14:38
I guess he wasn't an idiot after all.
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:16:23
Best to wait to price in bits after 10,000$ per bitcoin, as people have a problem with decimals.  If BTC is 10K, a bit will be a penny, if my math is right.
