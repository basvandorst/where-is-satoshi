If you don't include a moderator (arbiter), is there any automated escrow, like funds held until buyer confirms shipment?
@_date: 2016-04-05 18:52:38
There are several decentralized options. The best ones include some kind of mutually assured destruction, where we enter into a smart contract to both put funds at risk until the transaction is over. I know that option isn't being used. But simpler options are definitely possible.

Coming from the cult of sour grapes, that's funny.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:19:31
It's not equivalent at all. The fixed supply cap was a well-established economic policy we all knew about when investing. The blocksize cap was clearly documented as a short-term fix against attacks, and the stated intention was that it would be raised as network needs increased. As you well know.

@_date: 2015-12-14 16:46:24
Wallets will NEVER be able to know what fees are necessary. They can only guess, and as several people have pointed out, it's a moving target, and the guess can cause someone who DID pay the recommended fee for &lt; 1 hour wait to end up waiting over 24 hours.

He is not the one making the claim.

Doesn't coinbase have a small flat rate fee? If so, buying 1$ at a time is a horrible idea. Go with once or twice a month.
@_date: 2015-12-14 16:55:02
These are fees IN ADDITION to the block reward. Let's stop calling it charity.

The block rewards ARE paying for those resources. I made those rewards valuable by buying and holding bitcoin. It's not "free", you are seriously off-base here, and I'm surprised, I normally like your posts. You should take a step back and look at what's happening here. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:46:48
Unless he added all this stuff in 2013: 


@_date: 2015-12-14 16:50:11
They're not free while the block reward is still a thing. They're just paid by bitcoin holders, which is fine. You guys need stop acting like this experiment is past the threshold where it could fail. The block reward was designed to decrease over time to allow for enough adoption momentum to build. Short circuiting that process  is incredibly dangerous.

If you're seriously pretending that the rampant and egregious censorship here isn't happening, you're either willfully ignorant or just plain dishonest.

@_date: 2016-01-17 17:28:19
Making bitcoin into a settlements system instead of a p2p cash system also "defies" Satoshi's design.
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:33:00
Talking about it like it's available for use is misleading. The honest way to present it would be to qualify your statements, for example, "The Lightning Network *would* still construct Bitcoin transactions; it *would* just do so in a smarter way than using Bitcoin directly.

It's the free state *project*. Bills for full legalization are being pushed there every year.

If that's the most important thing to you, then you should. I'd rather live within a few minutes of thousands of other Bitcoin users.
@_date: 2016-02-06 20:38:46
NH was chosen based on a very detailed comparison with other states, based on taxes, economic activity, crime, native political atmosphere, etc. You can check out more at freestateproject.org. Overall NH is the clear winner. Bitcoin didnt' exist when it was chosen, but NH is where we're doing it, and so Bitcoin is huge there now. You may want to come to porcfest this year and see for yourself before writing it off.

@_date: 2016-02-22 20:37:19
Yes, two or three times as many very complicated transactions as would have fit before. The majority of transactions are NOT this complicated, and so this does NOT translate into a "2mb blocksize increase." But go ahead and keep spamming things you clearly don't even understand.

You're quoting Gavin without understanding the quote. Gavin is correct, you are incorrect. It has been clearly explained to you in this thread: 
I don't have a problem with SegWit, it solves some problems, but NOT scaling. It is not a good reason to refuse to raise the blocksize limit, and what you are mindlessly repeating about it is false.
@_date: 2016-02-22 21:04:39
He's not wrong, you just don't understand what he said. Maybe read all the replies you've gotten that spelled it out for you?

Roger saw proof that Gox had 10's of millions in their checking account, and proof that they were indeed having trouble with their wires because the bank had started stonewalling them. Both things were true. He NEVER said they were solvent or that he had done some kind of audit. I'm sure he regrets telling people anything that bolstered their confidence in Gox, but people wanted to know whatever information they could get, and he was trying to help. It's really fucked up to try and crucify him for it, he is a good dude and not responsible for risks other people take.

Text doesn't have a tone, it wasn't a barb, so don't get defensive. You missed my point - continue to miss my point - you may lack the perspective necessary to get it. Talking about "emotional reactions" - sheesh, seems like there is some projecting going on here. 
Last try: I support bitcoin because I want it to succeed. The increased price in the future is just a natural consequence. I would still support it if all it did was protect my purchasing power instead of increasing it. I want control over my own money, and I want other people to have this opportunity, too. Taking a risk that depends on a number of other people to share your vision and values does take strength, this is not a "congratulation", it's a simple fact. Seems like it bothers you for some reason.
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:59:28
100% on point. Stop stonewalling Satoshi's design - bitcoin was supposed to have large blocks and it should.

That's going to make it harder to pay ransoms, but not any harder to demand them.
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:22:57
Agreed. Bitcoin's sustainability depends on increasing adoption significantly beyond the current userbase. Without scaling to make that possible, it could collapse.
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:00:49
You can't have a solid "legal tender alternative" without a massive increase in adoption. You can't have an increase in adoption without an increase in price.

Not trying to be contentious here, but your "guesstimate" of actual bitcoin-based participation is based on nothing. That's not evidence. Also, we can't stop people from sending bitcoin to whomever they want, so it doesn't really matter. That's kinda the point.
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:07:08
There are plenty of people who do not sell regardless of their outlook on daily price movement, and they are most certainly strong hands. I know because "I are one" and know plenty more. Most of us buy regularly - I personally never "buy on dips" - automatic buys are much less stressful.
There are also plenty of people who get skinned trying to daytrade. I have a hard time feeling bad for them.
As far as TA, you are 100% correct. TA is a simultaneously hilarious and sad joke.

Most of those coins were imaginary so no harm there.
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:44:54
Nope, you're totally missing the point. I believe it will be worth more in the future IF people like me exist, because of what it allows me to do. I don't sell even if I think the price might be headed down for a little while, because I want to support the ideals that Bitcoin encapsulates, and selling removes my support. I put my value in Bitcoin. It takes strength to put my personal wealth at risk for these values, whether you want to admit it or not.
This may be beyond your comprehension, if so, I wish you the best and hope you figure it out some day.

Fiat is the cause of your frustrations; "selling fiat" is hard. Buying bitcoin is much easier if you were to buy it with say, hours of your labor or goods. And once you have bitcoin it is indeed easy to transfer. The problems we have using fiat to pay for it demonstrates exactly why we need it so badly.
I hope some Canadian users can help you out. Look for a bitcoin meetup and also check Mycelium's local trader network (just install their phone app.) 
It did used to be easier to use fiat before the banks started getting worried about dealing with bitcoin exchanges. And maybe it will be easier again in the future when more people are on board.  Good luck until then, hopefully you find an easier route soon.
@_date: 2015-10-11 16:32:33
What the shit are you smoking? OP isn't talking about network transaction volume, it's talking about how much people are buying. [Here's the amount of exchange volume IN USD for localbtc.]( If anyone's trying to be misleading it's clearly you. If lots of people are buying and holding - that's part of the "ecosystem."

The underlying instrument is tied directly to BTC price. So if the disparity becomes too large, I would expect people to be able to sell them to the trust at that price.

I'm not defending that behavior, because I don't agree with it, but it is probably a reaction to the HUNDREDS of high-value posters who were banned from this subreddit for the mere mention of XT.
