I was going to donate, but the request for personal information made me vomit a little.  
Dear Wikimedia: I want to give you money, not invite you over for coffee &amp; croissants.

Thanks Rich, I've contacted support before and received nothing useful, hence my asking publically.
The link provided shows bitpay not allowing withdrawals to any Asian country or currency.  Merchants in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Japan, Philippines, etc are reduced to "spectators", or at best "customers" of merchants in countries you find flavorsome.
I realize supporting an endless number of payout currencies is nonsensical at this point, i do not advocate for that in the slightest.  
However it would be beneficial to bitcoin adoption if merchants outside your curated list of predominantly caucasian countries were not forbidden from entering bitpay's garden.  Permission to withdraw just USD or EUR to accounts in Asia would paint a much more palatable picture.  I have a feeling merchants in Latin America and Africa feel the same.
You guys are doing a GREAT job in the areas you are focused, but i feel missing the boat when it comes to the world. After All, the exact same rails you use to transfer funds to an account in Australia can also handle transferring funds to all of these countries, so why restrict them from being merchants on your platform?  Whats the risk &amp; logic in doing so?

When will you be allowing companies in S.E. Asia to have merchant accounts with BitPay and withdraw to their S.E. Asian bank accounts?
BTW, thanks for copay! cool stuff

Tried booking a hotel in costa rica via expedia today, doesn't seem to be an option for this country.
