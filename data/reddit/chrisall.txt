Do you feel any form of remorse that your lack of adequate capability (people, process, technology) mr mt.gox, if not the root cause, has certainly been a key factor in the crash?
As a part of the network's critical infrastructure you have responsibilities...upgrading systems now, with a one month lead-time, after it's all turned to ratshit, is frankly contemptible.
The only saving grace is that hopefully, soon, open-source, decentralized exchange mechanisms will be developed by members of the community that put future sustainability of Bitcoin before lining their own pockets.

1) Central banks and policymakers are acting like barbers. They haircut your investments.
2) Negative real interest rates, inflation, currency devaluation, capital controls and outright default are the barber’s scissors.
3) Gradually reduce duration, risk positions and “carry” as the year proceeds.

I'm sure Satoshi could piss far higher up the wall than you, however he chose to use his talent to create something for the good of everyone. Grow a pair of balls and use your computer skills to create something, rather than destroy what others have created in order to line your master's pockets.

Thank you for your understanding and continuous support!
Yeah, I'm sure those that bought at $200+ would love to personally thank you and your crock of shit systems.
The problem is, even if you avoid gox like the pox, so many other sites rely on them as the de-facto price feed. Gox lags and everyone suffers.
No doubt a select few made a killing last night. I wan't one, but didn't lose anything either as I didn't sell....long and strong here.

transfer USD and bitcoin between buyer &amp; seller...why does $ actually have to transfer? BTC doesn't physically transfer. Buyer and seller could hold both USD and BTC balance in wallet and blockchain handles transactions in both currencies.

The voice of reason:
Roger Ver, founder of Bitcoinstore.com and an angel investor in Bitcoin start-ups, said that he knew of some entrepreneurs who had moved to Panama to explore setting up operations outside of the US.
“Even if US regulations make it hard for Bitcoin businesses to operate in the US, that doesn’t mean it will make it difficult for people to use Bitcoin as a currency in the US. Bitcoin is a world currency,” he said.

The price in USD has got f.all to do with it. If one share costs one BTC and dividend is 0.01 per week then the yield is 1% and ROI is 100 weeks.

Shorting will provide more financial reward for attacking the exchanges and allow those with the most $ to manipulate the price.

Plug your figures in here:
Note the comment about estimating difficulty:
Extrapolating bitcoin difficulty or price is pure voodoo. It is much easier to predict the relationship of the two parameters in form of the Mining Factor. The Mining Factor 100 is the value in USD of the bitcoins you can generate if you let a 100MHash/s miner run for 24 hours. If the Mining Factor 100 rises above $2 or so everybody buys mining equipment and thus increases difficulty. If it falls people will stop mining eventually. The estimate starts with the current Mining Factor and decreases it exponentially such that the decrease accounts for the factor decline per year. Please note that a profit/loss by holding the coins is not accounted for in this estimate

They are also a single point of failure and we need to spread the risk over multiple exchanges. If you're in the EU Bitstamp is the obvious choice for SEPA deposits.
