When you withdraw, how do you go about dealing with the taxes and crap like that? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:12:37
Good luck, friend.

How much to transfer to private wallet?

That's great... For those of you who aren't locked out of GDAX

Dude, don't use Coinbase. Check out the shit going on at @_date: 2017-12-11 16:26:32

@_date: 2017-11-24 21:45:50
What particular options would you personally recommend? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:30:29
Gotta start somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:12:41
Thanks, friend!

What is HODL? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:08:23
Thanks!

I used Coinbase for Android. It allowed me to specify the amount in USD and gave me that amount in BTC minus the fee for the purchase.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:48:40
What's wrong with Coin base? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:21:32
Thats very ballsy of you and frankly I cannot afford that level of risk but I sincerely hope it works out well for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:45:31
I wanted to watch it and observe before jumping in. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:25:04
I've been told "HODL". Lol. Thanks for the advice friend :) 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:50:51
That's why I finally bought in. Gotta start sometime and if it's going to keep rising, better late than never. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:59:34
I'll second that
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:46:42
I may do that. I went with Coin base so I think I can use BitCoin, Etherium, and something else. What do you think of Etherium? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:40:03
I think I am. I'm going to put a minimum of 20 per check into it and more if I can afford it. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:44:38
I see I've made a good decision and I'm good company. Cheers! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:40:34
Slow and steady my friend. Wanted to watch it and not rush into it. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:51:00
I used Coinbase
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:29:56
Which transfer service did you use?
