So the four other exchanges   also stopping withdrawals while they also do the fix should also be delisted?

With the exception of ethereum.
It will be owned and controlled therefore the owners and preminers will always have a lower cost basis for any contract on the system and therefore underbid every other contract that they really want.

Interesting image with a good point.
If the current jp down difference spreads more it extends the flat period though beyond what looks lkke an april 15 end (ironic).
Big difference now is bitcoin has lots of competition.
It also of course has the huge news that second market will open bitcoin up to hundrds of millions  from wall street in a few months.
And now cryptsy will open up tp direct dollar purchases of bitcoin and other currencies on its site.
Should be interesting.
Honestly i think all cryptos will rise in value since it will be so easy to buy them all.
And lots of people will want to get in who couldnt when it was too hard before.
Even if it all becomes a big gambling casino of crypto currencies there will be a lot more  money going into it.

My guess is those who thought it would drive down price already sold from 660 and that swhy we are at 590ish.
So it might flucuate some more on the day of the auction the 27? But right afterwards unless there are a lot of quick resales it shouldnt go lower and should start rising again.

I think at 10k it might be pretty universal.
But as a store of transferable wealth not payments.
I just dont see it being used as payments so much - at least not until large holders think it will stop appreciating .
One of the reasons retailers are giving discounts for bitcoin purchasers is the retailers believe the bitcoin they are getting in exchange for goods is going to be worth so much more than it is today.

It occured to me the other day that cyrpto currency trading is becoming the purest form of techinical analysis there is.
While people can argue the various merits of eafh crypto   non of them are income producing assests with secondary business value.  Annd among them thry all have various un provable claims to superiority.
So you end up with tradable assests that in reality simlle difference in something like "color". Not colored coins.
Just some lelvel of appeal as arbitrary as literal color.
Do you like orangecoins ? Green coins? Red coins? Blue coins? Or are you buying and selling based on the various expe tations of what the ebb and flow of the appeal of a color will be.
Its very fascinating.

The arguments for long term valuation around $100,000 .. the capitalization value of all world gold.. have long been made and have logical underpinnings. The increaee to $5000 is just another way point.

Why not?
Look there is huge reason to beleive bitcoin should at the least equal gold in captialized valie and that is over $100,000 per bitcoin.
But even if bitcoin doesnt go up it has proven itself to be very price stable over $400-600 so what risk are you REALLY taking? Not much. (as long as you are only using longterm and not rent and food money)
You wouldnt even be buying at the peak. It was over $1200 a few months ago so this is a valley.
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:06:58
It would seem this is a very fixable thing in the software  according to multiple reputable exchanges.
None the less it is temporarily causing fear which has depressed the price.
This fear will be cured as soon as the software fix is released which the exchanges say they are doing right now.
Thus it seems the perfect buying window.

Honestly if it crashed the marlet to sub $200 i'd buy like a mo fo.
We know price permanenetly stablized at over $590 (as much as we can know anything) so i think others would also jump in and buy alot of it went significantly below that just becuase of this sale. Ot would almost be  a sure thing (at least as much as possible)  . I think you are underestimating the  umber of new or repeat buyers that would come into the market if prices went down that much just during this sale period and it woukd prevent a hugely significant drop like $200.
