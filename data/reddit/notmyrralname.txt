Hey! remember this conversation we had a month ago? heheh. Look what I just saw: 
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:52:43
Post your research?
If true, this completely flies in the face of all of the “bitcoin is the most decentralized” arguments.
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:17:23
Not cherry picking. The situation is exactly the same. Water is a finite resource. Needless consumption is irresponsible. 
Besides. The article specifically states hydro in the northwest.
@_date: 2019-07-08 05:20:29
Fair enough. I appreciate like minds. I should also say i am far from being anti bitcoin. I think there will most definitely be a need for a digital “gold”. Im not of the belief that bitcoin as it is has a chance in hell of being a world currency however. 
If its true only a fraction is dirty, great. Ill accept that. Would still prefer to see data to back that up. But for the sake of civility ill move on. 
It still doesnt address two things for me:
1) when there is a solution to secure a network that is more energy efficient, continuing to use less efficient means is nothing more than wasteful. Make no mistake, i am not convinced using off peak power is somehow free, because it flies in the face of logic (however shitty my analogies).
2) according to the article the current burden of bitcoin is the size of ireland. For bitcoin to reach its stated purpose it would need to scale exponentially. And with it its energy consumption. There is a point (probably not far away) where it goes beyond “excess” energy. What is the solution then? Ignoring that bitcoin IS energy intensive, unnecessarily, and pressing forward with disregard, kicks the can down the road.
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:20:23
Designing unnecessary inefficiency into a system is not “innovation” however. 
Power consumption should always try to be reduced, not designed to be the opposite.
Edit: “hey Ireland!! Turn off ALL of your electrical devices. We are using Bitcoin!!!”
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:48:53
Hahahahaha. Hardly admitting defeat. I was being hyperbolic. 
You dont get to claim knowledge by birthright. If it was possible id also be able to say that i know more than you because my grandparents actually helped to build the dams that i live near. Not just design them. 
In any rate. 
Needless consumption of a resource does not force conservation. It encourages over use.
Any notion you have that increasing the demand on the power grid will somehow force better utilization completely contradicts history. Its no different than trying to say that because more people are driving cars today than 100 years ago that we will use less oil.
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:29:46
Cost of mining is not the issue. I dont care how much a miner saves by using off peak power.
At issue is the fact that every watt of power used for mining increases the load on the power grid. And that load increases the consumption of resources, even “clean” semi-renewable resources. 
Unnecessary consumption of resources is irresponsible. 
Thats the issue. Not the dollar cost of mining.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:51:31
Im not at all anti bitcoin. But there is no way this “researcher” is being unbiased. Because even a child could tell you that whatever amount of energy consumption that bitcoin uses is IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT DEMANDS ON THE POWER GRID. 
Even if every watt of bitcoin processing was done with clean energy, that is still energy that is being consumed and not available for other things.
When energy consumption is only going to continue to rise, and there being a real environmental impact to ALL energy use, reduction on the power grid should be paramount. 


The author admits to the power necessary. As much as the entire nation of Ireland. 
What is important to note: that is current consumption, while bitcoin is used by an almost immeasurable amount of the population. 


Banking today uses 100 terawatts (according to the author). And it is handling banking for the entire globe.
Now, im now mathematician. But last i knew 30 was a LOT more than 2% of 100.
A little closer to reality is that for bitcoin to handle the amount of volume as current banking it would need to increase in size 10000x or more. 
Do the math. 30 x 10,000. How much more energy would bitcoin cost compared to current banking then?
In their haste to craft a narrative where bitcoin is environmentally friendly the author seems to have made some huge (yet simple) leaps of logic. 
ANY AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT BITCOIN USES IS IN ADDITION TO CURRENT DEMANDS. 
ANY AMOUNT OF UNNECESSARY ENERGY SPENT IS A WASTE. 
also, i live in the northwest, we dont have tons of excess energy laying around. Climate change has reduced the amount of water we have in reservoirs. And most of the power here is exported elsewhere, California is a big user.
@_date: 2019-07-08 05:22:51
The argument put forward again and again is that bitcoin is mined by everyone. Making it so energy intensive that the only way to be profitable is to be in a warehouse located near a dam then it is no longer the people’s coin it is reported to be.
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:23:34
Lets all empty the lakes with frivolous, energy-wasteful bitcoin production; fill the oceans with plastic bags; burn old tires for fun; and toss trash out the windows of our cars! Flatten the mountains! Burn the rain forests!
Because there’s no need to be conservative with our resources. Its for network security!!
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:35:48
Who said that? No. Its irresponsible for anyone to turn a blind eye to needles consumption.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:15:35
There are many alternative solutions that dont use PoW. I dont need to solve it, its already been solved. 
Needless energy consumption spent on running an algorithm to compete for the opportunity to record a block is not a requisite to solve the Byzantine General problem. Its just one method
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:16:47
 A lot to digest here. Its late. Will respond tomorrow. But i appreciate the lively chat
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:14:32
Sorry. But, you dont get it. Im very clear on how energy production works. There is no waste that bitcoin is just using leftover. U need to do a little more homework im afraid.
And, yes. It IS like they have to burn more oil or coal. Because bitcoin mining is IN ADDITION TO current energy demands. 
Your sweet mining rig doesnt distinguish between hydro electricity and coal. 
Dont be so unintelligent
Edit: downvoting me doesnt make the truth go away.
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:31:19
Let me be clear, and not facetious, bitcoin is not being produced with only excess energy that would otherwise be released over the dam. Suggesting such is just plain foolishness. 
It is in addition to current demands on the power grid. Stop ignoring this fact and may be you and i can have an actual conversation.
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:58:24
Haha. You still dont understand that all energy comes at a cost, even hydro. 
I live next to a hydroelectric plant in fact. Ive even toured through them. Have you?
Are you aware where hydro power comes from? Where the water that feeds them comes from? That the snow where the water comes from has been diminishing over the last 40 years? That over the last 10 years many dams run nearly dry because of low snow pack and constant, increasing energy demands? And it is projected that within the next 30 years there will no longer be any snow pack in the northwest?
See, fool. You think you know everything but clearly you do not. Sure, right now mining operations are able to take advantage of lower cost “off peak” power. But if there was not a demand off peak that energy (read: water held in a reservoir) would not need to be used at all and would be available the next day for on peak use.
There is no such thing as a free lunch. ALL ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS ADDITIVE. Meaning, it all adds up. The power consumed by mining rigs is spent and the next day, when someone turns on their toaster, that power comes from somewhere doesnt it?
Think of every hour of energy use as a gallon of water moving down a stream. A dam is like a great big battery holding back the water. But as soon as that water goes through the dam to make electricity it doesnt come back. If you use a gallon of water tonight to run your mining rig, that gallon is gone, regardless of what time of day its used. And if there is a drought (as there have been lately) that battery doesnt get recharged. 
Here are the unarguable facts that you are ignoring:
1) all energy comes at a cost and is additive. 
2) hydroelectric power (though “clean”) is not inexhaustible. In fact it is finite, determined by the availability of water.  
3) The northwest (your holy land of everlasting clean bitcoin mining energy) is experiencing the effects of climate change which are likely to dramatically reduce the availability of its water resources. Many dams currently run dry in the summers. And the annual snow pack that feed these dams is expected to almost (if not completely) go away in the next 30 years. 
4) as populations grow, and a dependance on electrical devices grows, the demand for electricity grows as well.
5) creating technologies that unnecessarily consume electricity, as the demands for it are already stressed, is wildly and insanely irresponsible.
Edit: need to add onto my thought, because you are also wrong about mining not contributing to increased use of oil or coal. 
Another fact about the power here in the NW, we export it to other areas of the country. So that big battery of water is able to help augment the demand on grid demands in other parts of the country. But if we dont have it. We cant send it. 
So. That gallon of water your rig irresponsibly consumed last night took a gallon of water away from being able to be exported to parts of the country that dont have clean energy. So they are forced to use their dirty power instead. 
As i said. It all comes at a cost.
@_date: 2019-07-31 20:06:35
Curious, why? Because money you borrow today will be worth less tomorrow. So essentially (if you pay it back) you are paying back less than you borrowed, relatively speaking?
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:40:13
I think its pretty obvious why the market is favoring bitcoin, and its not because its the most useful technology. Its because its all speculative trading. 
Its not because it is the best solution for global currency. Slight bumps in volume cause hour long waits to transact. It will never achieve its stated purpose if it continues this way.
Its also irresponsible in the extreme to wastefully consume energy.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:13:32
I think more likely, governments will back their own, similar to how it is now with fiat currencies. Or governments will fight to gain control of cryptos by mining dominance, like I read in an article to how Russia is trying to top China in the Bitcoin mining game.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:18:01
ok. so in my imaginary world, there are scores of tech savvy hobos, congregating around free wifi. Sure there will still be your luddites that beg the ol' fashion way. But, they need to get on board, man! crypto is all the rage! As fast as Bitcoin is rising, that handful of Wei is now worth thousands!!!! thousand my friend. Youre gonna see the richest hobos driving old Honda Civics, livin' the good life.
Ah, Im a dreamer I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:07:59
I think you could see a homeless person easily begging for bitcoin today.
1) With not much more than an old ipod, anyone could buy and sell bitcoin
2) There are free wifi access points all over the place, Starbuck and Mcdonalds for example.
Crazy thought, a homeless beggar, instead of holding a can or a boot, holding out a QR scanner, asking for a couple Wei.
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:38:33
I believe the correct term is “bold faced”
Immediate edit: 
I was wrong before i even posted it. Seems both are acceptable.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:37:13
Heheheh. I like it. Yes, in my fantasy world the underside of bridges will be alight with Wifi hot spots instead of barels of burning trash. The homeless warming their hands on the emmitted electromagnetic radiation. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:09:36
well said.
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:29:40
No. The authors argument ignores known facts and doesnt bother to make logical deductions.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:01:19
Im new. I want to go to gdaxbtc.com just to try and familiarize myself with what a scam will look like. Is it unsafe to even visit from my phone? 
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:06:29
One labo’s worth. No more, no less. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:14:16
Screw ppc. Im in marketing. What we need is not the same old advertiser-to-platform-to-consumer. We need direct from advertiser-to-consumer. Platforms like facebook, and even reddit, should not be the ones making the money when they are generating nothing. 
Instead it needs to be content creators are rewarded for making stuff and consumers rewarded for viewing ads.
As an advertiser, i would much prefer the money i spend on ads go directly to the people i want to see my product. As opposed to some magazine where my ad is buried and never looked at. 
 
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:02:09
Agreed. 2018 will be amazing...the year of adoption for sure. ;)
@_date: 2019-09-10 21:03:10
However, Ripple does not control those validators, they are independently operated and the list is growing all the time.
You could become a trusted validator yourself. Or you could redirect your node to a completely different set of trusted validators. 
Because it comes with a default set does not give Ripple any more control at all.
Still, does not address the original question as to how it requires permission. As no permission is needed to send/validate transactions. And the network is not centrally controlled.
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:39:28
It is disingenuous to say “Ripple’s validator nodes” though, because Ripple does not own the majority of them. So its not like they have control. In fact Ripple has something like less than 7% of the total number of nodes. 
The way the xrp network reaches consensus is nothing short of clever and interesting though. And has stood the test of time this far.
@_date: 2019-09-10 04:29:59
hahahah. So ironic that you would use the same argument that ignorant people use against bitcoin "printed from thin air".
And waaaaay off there pal on how consensus is achieved. 
second oldest crypto in existence and 2nd largest my market cap, youd think if changing consensus rules was so easy someone would have exploited it. The fact is, thats not how it works.
This "scam" argument is so baseless and tired.
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:02:30
Lets see your proof. No shilling, just facts. Explain to me specifically how xrp requires anyones permission and how exactly you come to the conclusion the xrp network is centralized.
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:47:40
Shill post? The one that refutes misinformation and answers the op’s question?
You should really probably take the time to learn what the word “shill” means if you intend to continue using it.
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:23:29
Um. Speaking of needing to do research, you seem to have failed 
Let me help you along. 
“Ripple was conceived by Jed McCaleb and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz who then approached Ryan Fugger who had debuted in 2005 as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network”
After bitcoin, xrp is the second oldest.
