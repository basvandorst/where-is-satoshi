You must be very young.... Surely you know the banking system as we know it today took decades to mature, and "online banking" was very confusing/difficult when it first came up 20 or so years ago...
This is new tech child.

I transferred 64 dollars at low fee this morning, electrum to coinbase took like 2 hours. Not the worst ever.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:51:07

Uhh, I just some $300 for $1 an hour ago it confirmed in 18 minutes. Use segwit. Do research. Coinbase is terrible.

Please build a ledger with stronger compute so it can handle pool mining deposits directly (dust) AND with more memory...
Also, please build out a universal wallet app, having to launch a separate app for each coin or almost every coin is super annoying

why would anyone own shit?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:50:47
So the way I see it there are a few things that can happen....
1.  We've passed our 50 day moving average - no surprise there, we were massively overbought. Ignore that, it's gone.
2. We're slightly over-sold on our 100 day M.A.; which means we passed/went under support at $10,600 - that's bad, but we're only 1k under it so we could POTENTIALLY recover to that range in the next few days.
3. The 200 Moving Average is $7,100; we should see VERY strong support there.  If we drop below $7k, god help you all.  From there Ihave no idea.
Now I put a few other trend lines on this graph...The most important ones are from November 14th to today, and from back in August to today - they both are straight lines to around our current price right now indicating to me anyway a more normalized growth curve.  This leads me think there might be some confidence that we're looking at our floor/support right here in the 9.4k-9.6k range.  
That said, if you take a purely linear growth line from back in Late July/early August it puts us at right back at the 200 day moving average around 7k - so that could also happen.
Anyway........this actually made me feel a little better than we might be in a more sustainable range now.

@_date: 2017-12-03 21:01:13
No.. Why would you do that
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:04:04
No futures never touch the underlying asset. They're simply wagers on whether that asset will rise or fall in value.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:07:06
Had you invested 1 bitcoin 20 minutes ago, you'd have already made $200+
Are you still waiting?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:40:15
How is this secure, if it's off chain.  I thought the whole point of bitcoin was an on-chain/ledger record of transactions so it's immutable and confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:45:33
More like 12 days.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:32:00
Also interested in why? Is money not important to you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:45:14
This isn't a lie - if it wasn't explicit before, it is now and that's a big deal in the tax world.  A "loophole" was filled.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:56:25
I don't understand why everyone's complaining about high transaction fees I've been sending Bitcoin no problems like a dollar or two....
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:30:26

That said, we're only down 20%..... Who gets a divorce over that? Shit people lost way more in the 2008 financial crisis. Your wife seems unreasonable, I wouldn't be too upset about it she probably sucks. 
Anyway, keep the money I'm Bitcoin. When it hits 25k in a few weeks you'll be very happy.  Dump the wife either way though, she's a mistake... Getting pissy over 20% lol...

It's ridiculous advice buying at an all-time high with something like Bitcoin is totally acceptable especially if you believe in the underlying concept of Bitcoin and believe it will go up long term.

Don't. Coinbase is a scam

@_date: 2017-12-22 01:57:11
I understand that, I'm not trying to FUD; but can we ignore there's a lot of "bad" right now;
1. strong downward trend in price
2. mempool/unconfirmed transactions hours away from being at 300k
3. Next difficulty adjustment is still 11 days away
Unless there's some sort of emergency difficulty adjustment, this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.

It's ok to add other coins, but they should have implemented SEGWIT first.   The only logical explanation for doing bcash first, is insider-trading and corruption in league with Jihan Wu.

Stop being whiney. If you want Bitcoin buy and don't worry if it dips. Grow up, the market isn't out to get you, if you buy and it dips that's coincidence. Investment implies longer timelines. 
If you want to day trade that's another story.

GUYS I WAS SCAMMED, SO PLEASE SEND ME BITCOIN I SWEAR NO BAMBOOZLE!
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:16
Well the tech isn't working either so....
I tink you're kidding yourself if you're saying you didn't get in for some $$
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:45:41
But will they ever get the coin?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:14:36
I don't know... Seemed legit until you included a donation address.
Anyway, if real you need help not Bitcoin.  Call someone.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:06:10
Why would you sell?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:34:37
You forgot the new GOP tax plan that passed on capitol hill.  That's major news, and impacts crypto-to-crypto trading significantly, with a much higher tax burden/risk.
Combine that with human nature, people like to have "cash" around the Holidays for gifts, and also people tend to close investment positions in December for any tax purposes gains/losses AND you have a pefect storm of shit that has led to the dip.
I'm unsure where we go from here, because I can't see the future; however my hope is that once this news is digested and the new year turns over we'll be set back on the right path.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:57:03

Not sure, but I've seen filthy hospital rooms, shitty technology, massive lead times to see specialists and doctors, lines lines lines, sub-par healthcare providers, shortages of medical equipment and medicine, and emergency rooms that look like they're from the 40's with 15+ hour wait times  etc. 
I think its great that everyone ON PAPER as "Healthcare" but when the care itself is so garbage people with means still fly from across the world to go to Hospitals in Boston, Texas, California, Washington, etc. what does that tell you? And it's not just the patients, When the most qualified practitioners flee their home countries to work here, what does that tell you? 
I think we need to differentiate universal healthcare from quality healthcare. It's your classic quality of quantity argument.  While its cool that everyone "has healthcare," do they really have healthcare...really?  I mean if you want to just tell everyone they have healthcare sure, then lets do that.
Plus, even those without private insurance/healthcare here; can get treated by the best medical institutions in the world via emergency services, medicaid, medicare, etc.
I think its kind of bull shit the world snubs the USA on Healthcare when in reality if ya'll ever get REALLY REALLY sick; you're going to do anything you can to come here - and guess what you're odds of surviving the worst illnesses here in good 'ol USofA will be a lot higher than in Latvia, or Greece, Italy, etc. even the big countries Germany, France etc.  It's also why the Shieks all come to the USA for healthcare.  Its like the way we measure "good healthcare" is totally fubar; it's measured on how many people have it - now how good the quality of care actually is.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:10:26
Slaughtered. 
Losing faith bois.  We should be going in the other direction by now.....
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:28:06
Meh - whatever, at least it got those scam coins outa circulation and probably into the hands of individuals. I see all of this as growing pains to creating a more stable bitcoin market, and eventual bull market.
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:30:02
I live in the u.s. And I find Health Care to be incredibly good and I would say that I am very middle-class in fact I live close to some of the best hospitals in the entire world.... Strangely enough people from all over the world fly here for Healthcare treatments so who has bad Health Care? Have you ever seen a hospital in in most of Europe? 
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:54:12
I don't get how that would happen. I'm not even sure I get why eth is valuable... What does it do that Bitcoin doesn't?
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:03:01
No. I'll cash out at 100k.
Prob not though.

Just because there's no replay protection doesn't mean you won't be able to carefully split to hold both coins, you will.

@_date: 2017-11-10 14:42:22
"huge dips"?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:27:43
Nope. So long as you have your seed you can recover them since all Bitcoin remain on the block chain forever
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:07:51

For the billionth time, there is no anti-tampering seal.  Those are easy to fake, and add almost no real value other than peace of mind for the simple-minded.
Ledger needs to pass attestation, and you can open it up and check the components if you're really concerned beyond that.  But ultimately, you're fine if it connects with no errors you're good to go.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:40:05
Never. We're going to the Moon
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:41:52
Why would there be a correction?
I don't get why everyone assumes there will be corrections... Why isn't 8k an acceptable price level?
No more corrections. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:34:06
What do you mean? You don't actually put coins in a hardware wallet.... The wallet is the key to the block chain where you"coins" are.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:10:14
No?  Do you think people investing in 401ks, any security, ETFs, funds etc on average have any idea what they're doing?
Answer is no they don't.....This is adoption.

Yeah it's amazing I was talking to my friends and they said the same thing.. When I told them they didn't need to buy a WHOLE Bitcoin, they were amazed.

No more dips. Only the Moon.

To be expected. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:51:30
So you were trying to time the market.
That's never a good idea
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:52:11
wow lucky as hell...been trying since the "dip" started no luck.  We'll be back over 10k by the time I can get on I bet.
Nice little scam by Coinbase et. al

I held the dip. Does that count?
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:38:35
Why would you do that? You can't lose any coins if you own them.... You'll get both coins at the split
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:40:49
Are you seriously worried about $150?
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:19:03
Bold Prediction?
No correction.  ATH at the time of the fork will be 11.8k; we'll see a panic sell from inexperienced losers drive it to 10.9k for like 2-3 days, then it'll sky rocket to 15k and all those sellers will be f'd
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:47
Good.  Now's not the time to sell anyway, they're doing you a favor.  Hodl.

clearly some technical issues.  I can't login.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:40:45
Problem is this doesn't work for people who bought Bitcoin after the bch fork. Imo any forked coin is entirely different than Bitcoin and should not be factored into any "total price/value" number of Bitcoin itself.
I understand your argument, I just think it's a slippery slope; what happens if we get a new fork every month ya know? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:38:42

@_date: 2017-11-02 18:27:51
I'll give you my BTC address, send me all your money. Be quicker that way.

@_date: 2017-11-02 00:40:08
Yeah it's fine. I mean to be totally fair if you're talking about a small amount of Bitcoin at this point you're probably fine in coinbase your risk profile is pretty low anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:16:07
if by crash you mean go to the moon, sure.

@_date: 2017-11-02 00:09:08
Honestly I'm not sure a comparison like this can be made anymore the market has matured there's more people investing blockchain is mainstream and it's not 2013.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:10:13
whats that widget breh i need it
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:12:42
Actually not all terrible - I mean all the "bubble bubble bubble" is FUD - but there was some good notes from the FED on Blockchain application that sounded positive for Bitcoin etc.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:12:36
Why. People keep saying 'there's gonna be a correction'
Why? Some Wall Street analyst said so?
What if they're wrong and we're witnessing something totally new happen here.
Buy now, and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:07:34
Post a screenshot of your short position then, if you're so certain.

4.1 - therefore Bitcoin is responsible for the Jedi purge and rise of the empire.  Also Darth Jar Jar confirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:55
ahh nope - there was your 2 minute correction; now we'll see steady growth back up over 11k in the next 2-3 days; and onwards to 15k by the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:31:10
I really don't think we should be counting split alt coins..... We need the core chain to achieve these milestones.

@_date: 2017-11-01 23:43:32
wtf u talking about?  Bitcoin is skyrocketing....
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:35:58
I'd also dig into this statement; as far as I understand the way its written/law - They are referring to cash balances at Coinbase being insured.  E.G. if they are hacked, and they steal 10BTC, and $800 dollars from your account, you'll get the $800 back via insurance but the BTC is gone.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:55:42

Why are you here shitting on ledger and shilling trezor
If you like trezor cool. Many many many people like the nano s too. 
They both do what they do very well. I personally do not like the trezor form factor.

The more you invest the more you stand to make and the more you stand to lose that's the way investing works. Find out what your risk tolerance is and wager as much as you possibly can. If you're young wager more you can always make more money.

You don't need to divide by 21000000. Bitcoin only needs to be 1 million and a Satoshi will be 1c. Theroizing the maximum now is silly,

@_date: 2017-09-11 22:00:44
I think you might just need to deal with it this time - the price fluctuated only a few hundred dollars over the last few days - so there wasn't huge arbitrage anyway. Resolve the issue and move on IMO, Gemini is still the best.
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:20:37
1 million+
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:50:08
I use Gemini - it's $500 limit on daily ACH; unlimited wire's w/ $20 fee usually.
I dont think there's any-way around the limitations atm.  I'm also wiating on a wire to clear so I can buy more.  Huge PITA.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:44:05

@_date: 2017-09-07 11:54:13
No it doesn't...
Gold has zero actual utility. You can't walk around with a gold bar and go into Store and buy something with it.
This is a fallacy. Nor is it used for a basis on the dollar anymore. When you"buy" on the commodities market, you are not giving gold either. Also gold can be manufactured. Is it used it jewelry and computers? Sure, but so are diamonds and those hold no real value anyway outside of the cartel manipulation.  Also a computer isn't valuable because it has good in it, lol. 
You're wrong. Gold is the same as bit coin from an investment perspective, but worse you can actually buy stuff with btc.   This isn't the 1800s, it's the tech age and BTC &gt; Gold.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:01:56
You should be good.  Will take a coupe days prob.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:46:32
I think even this post, meaning your reply is a bit dramatic.  There is no failing experiment.  Bitcoin IS NOT going anywhere, even if China does FULLY ban bitcoin, not just the exchanges it's not going to die.  Bitcoin will be around for a LONG time, and will continue to climb.  There's a ton of FUD out there atm; lots of inexperienced investors in general seeing a 10-15% drop and panic selling.  As Buffet always says, BUY when there is Fear.  That's my plan.
I still predict 10k per bitcoin within 2 years, and 50k in 5-7 years, 100k in 10k-15k years.  I am, and will continue to be a regular buyer.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:55:40
You clearly have no idea what your talking about. If he uses nicehash he'll be paid for his hashpower regardless of his contribution to the pool mining alt prob equihash, and will be paid in BTC. Please stop.

I see, so this isn't for if you mine on your own it; its purely bought hashing power?

omg dude grow up
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:24:44
That's pretty good. But the math seems wierd.
Litecoins are like 70 per right? At .003/day isn't that like 21c?
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:40:19
My feeling, plebs would panic sell assets tied to bitcoin to cover expenses/try to bail themselves out.  However, long term BTC would go up as a safe haven against a crashing USD.

Omg mod someone delete this garbage post.
Nicehash is perfectly fine, and reputable it sounds like you're just an idiot.
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:09:54
Actually this is very interesting - as with many other technologies, the solution that is adopted by "porn" is usually the one that survives - e.g. BluRay etc.
If "porn" sites start accepting bitcoin en-masse, it will become very rapidly a standard.
TBH - I can't imagine why they don't already, with it being totally anonymous it makes perfect sense.

Gotcha...was gonna say - that'd be weird.

It doesn't impact my ability to use BTC though right? It's still "Bitcoin" not a shitcoin.... It just offers lower fees?

That is not why...

Alright because I own 2 Bitcoin today. Ok let's not do the "real Bitcoin vs. whatever" thing you know what I mean. I went to gemini, bought 2 Bitcoin transferred it to a hardware wallet.
So, that's currently worth about 10k let's say.
Segwit2x happens, theoretically I'll get two of the let's call it 2x Coin. So now I have two Bitcoin, and two 2x coins right?
Surely both coins will not be worth 5k each? I'm not going to double my money right?
So I'm assuming the value of what we call Bitcoin today would theorectically need to drop to be in equilibrium with the new forked coin, or the new coin would need to jump to 5k and the"old coin" would become worthless?

@_date: 2017-09-13 18:11:04
It's not your money at all so it's entirely unethical of you to keep any profit for yourself. Keep what you need to cover fee's.  Or better yet, just write her a check for the value of the coin today, buy her coin off her and hodl it for yourself.

Oh for God's sake mods people got questions and this certainly pertains to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:47:48
Depends on the transfer type.
ACH transfers are available immediately to buy BTC/Eth with.  However, they aren't cleared into your account until your funds clear 3-5 days later - so you can buy, but you can't withdraw etc.
Wire transfers are available as soon as the wire completes, usually 2-3 days.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:27:33

Top kek
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:43:39
I believe they are heavily insured; but I will investigate moving BTC off.
Another quick question - 
Currently my computer is disassembled, as I upgrade some components. (the one with electrum installed on it) if I sent BTC while the system is down to my address, will it still get there?
I know that's prob a dumb question, but I'm just wondering how my electrum wallet knows BTC has been sent to it if its disconnected from the web.
I suppose this is why I should get a mobile hardware wallet? e.g. trezor?
Trezor or Ledger Nano S?
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:27:13
Right there with you bro.

I guess! 
Maybe I'll just stick with the nano 3 and ledger wallets ;)
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:03:31
That's what I did! Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:10:05
Would it not crash the value of Bitcoin almost immediately?
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:54:23
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:53:46
Sure sure, why not. 
Just wonder though, like eventually there's gonna be 2 or 3 currencies right, hahaa...man it'll be confusing as balls if in the future we need to use tons of different ones all the time.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:03:22
i got a ledger
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:48:27

Ledger nano s
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:53:47
Yeah but they eventually got thier money, it was because 10k people signed up in like a week.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:22:09
High prices?
Will these be high prices when Bitcoin reaches 50k?
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:15:56
"I don't know what you mean by attestation, you trust a certificate ?"
Exactly.  So get out, if you don't know what you're talking about - stop talking.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:13:58
So basically there's 20 million of lost bitcoin, forever.  wow.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:59:43
"seems like it has gotten much higher in the last 2 years"
Understatement of the decade
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:06:59
It's not
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:58:36
if they are fake, they cannot pass attestation.  I literally don't know how you aren't following this.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:45:25
Why not. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:57:33

I sorta thought dash looked appealing tbh... I'll have to do more research.
Anyway, in your opinion is it not worth owning any alt Coin just put it all into bt
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:38:33
But there is not consensus..... So it's looking like it'll be a chain split
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:41:23
Not with that attitude.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:27:57
Most likely a dip. Then a rebound. But you'll get some shitcoin for free.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:35:33
So should I move all of my BTC off of Gemini and onto Electrum?
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:01:26
That is counter to your argument that makes it seem like you want S2X and the death of Bitcoin as we know it, is it not?
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:44:00
Hodling and getting ready to buy 20k more. Silly sheep

@_date: 2017-10-31 18:08:26
Ehhhhhhhh, i dont know he made a good point in the second piece with the whole "do we buy bitcoin 1 or 2, gold or cash" etc. etc.  That is confusing, and a barrier to entry for mainstream investors etc.  Bitcoin DOES need to get a handle of these forks, especially the malicious ones like 2x; once that stabilizes we won't be talking about the moon; we'll be talking about Uranus.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:29:14
Not correct.  Ledger will post instructions on how to claim BTG when there is BTG to claim.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:03:24
Currency doesn't care about community.....shitcoins are shitcoins, I don't care how nice the people are that support it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:46:46
Because you can't go back 1 second and buy it then. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:49:11
If you wait, you'll miss out.  Don't try to time the market over a few hundred, or even a thousand bucks.  Buy continually, and you'll cost average yourself to a median.  From there, you trust that BTC will go the moon and you'll retire at 38.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:21:24
yep! lol

Segwit is a pretty universally accepted positive upgrade to the bitcoin network that provides for faster transactions, and lower fee's.  there's no reason to not use it unless you don't like money and prefer higher fee's and longer transaction times. 
do some googleing;
This is not Segwit2x which is what everyone hopes will fail.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:44:56
I mean there's a risk your transaction isn't confirmed in time I guess?  
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:01:43
I think "which" is also pretty clear....

Segwit......it's way better.
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:33:53
Is this why they raised trading fees? To pay his salary?
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:19:10
Can your wife see your bitcoin transactions (most likely not), and are those traction's tagged with scandalous names, (no).
so it's perfect for slimey folk out there!
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:52:29
Prob through gemini then to a hardware wallet, like a ledger nano s.
I wouldn't buy all 100k at once though. Maybe do 10k at a time and move it out if the exchange in chunks.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:50:59
Yeah I have one of those already
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:50:20
You're not wrong, but for large scale adoption what you're asking is unreasonable.
When I buy something with the CC I don't have to pull out my phone and check tx rates/calculate my own fee etc. That's not a tenable process for long term, main stream adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:29:21
I look for opportunities to use it...I think we all should
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:49:30
venmo it to me and i'll buy some for you ;)
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:04:11

So now what...
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:56:20
not really - 40 million is more likely than $0, BTC has to scale to something like 100,000,000 for 1 satoshi to = 1c which would be the dream scenario. 
Think about how excited people are that 1mBTC = $5.00.  Just imagine if 1 satoshi = 1c how nuts people would go, it would at that point become the main currency of the world no doubt.
