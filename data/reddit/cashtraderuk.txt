Yes, they don't take the transaction fee into account when you withdraw your full wallet balance. The negative balance is always negligible so just ignore it.

HSBC also commonly delay legitimate payments or even stop them completely without informing the sender or recipient!

My trezor weights 0.42 oz and I have 20 BTC stored on it so 1 oz of BTC for me is roughly $10.398.36 at current price!

I'm not saying it's dead, just that they are sucking the life out of it. If they really can't come to some sort of compromise I think the way forward is to split and may the best man win!

Pip pip!

You could also bang your head against a wall and see if that helps!

I figure it would cost around 1000 BTC to buy it and do some basic repairs and install WIFI etc
So maybe have 1000 shares go for 1 BTC each which entitles shareholders to stay at the island if they should so wish.
Maybe the core team could use it as a hideout from Roger Ver :P

I just tested it using only my right hand and had no issues. Slightly more difficult having to get the thumb under it rather than holding with my left hand, but apart from that not a problem.

I own a Trezor and Ledger Nano S. I still love my Trezor, but now prefer the Ledger. They are both very easy to setup and use. If you've used either than using the other is a walk in the park.

It's cheap as it requires a boat trip for access and a lot of renovation and sadly any listed building in UK costs a fortune to renovate.

Anyone fancy starting a LTD company to buy this island and rename it Bitcoin island?
@_date: 2016-11-30 10:43:59
So no different to Coinbase then? Care to explain how we have been tricked or how it's now 10x harder?
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:10:40
We could start a charity for burnout BTC traders / programmers and use the island as a getaway / relaxation resort.
@_date: 2016-12-05 11:23:46
If you can afford to lose it then yes It's a good investment. I'm personally balls deep in BTC, but aware at the same time that the investment is extremely risky, but also know that the upside potential is just as extreme in the next 5 years.
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:06:16
I don't think so
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:26:07
Here's a list of the 3 biggest UK P2P websites in no particular order for you to consider if Coinbase shut or freeze your account. I'm not kidding they do shit like that!
I sell on all 3 and know from personal experience that they are all completely reliable and trustworthy sites.

My daughter hates me talking about Bitcoin, so I bought her a Trezor for her birthday and said "Your birthday money is on that, here's the seed and my wallet address if you want to change it to fiat" 
People take far more interest when they have a stake in it! 
@_date: 2016-12-14 13:39:34
Many would argue it is!

Tiring and annoying yes, but useless no. If I've learnt anything from watching 'Walking Dead' it's best to fight!

A panda walks into a café. He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and proceeds to fire it at the other patrons.
"Why?" asks the confused, surviving waiter amidst the carnage, as the panda makes towards the exit. The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.
"Well, I'm a panda," he says. "Look it up."
The waiter turns to the relevant entry in the manual and, sure enough, finds an explanation. "Panda. Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves."

They certainly aren't banks. If they where they'd be borrowing 10x against any BTC deposits and making loans ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:03:10
Well banks do the work to secure my fiat, I still call the wankers and use their facilities. Miners just like bankers have their own interests at heart, not mine!

30000+ trades and 3 years into my relationship with BTC. We've had our ups and downs, but I still love you more than anything in the world! We are now stronger than we've been in a long time. Have my baby please!!!

Segwit doesn't start signalling until the 15 Nov and then doesn't become active until 95% hash support. There is no harm in wallets being Segwit ready in advance.

"But trusted, centralized payment systems will always be cheaper and faster than a decentralized system"
Faster at the moment yes, but cheaper no. Bitcoin will eventually not only compete with them, but I believe completely dominate them. That may be 5-10 years down the road, but it's coming :)

I have a Will for my daughter, but have put the seed words for recovery in a separate location that only she knows. Basically the Will just has the basic instructions and pin code.

I propose smaller intervals of 500 to include immediate activation of Segwit and then in 6-12 months we can consider 1000 intervals!

In no particular order all 3 of these sites are the most reliable for UK buyers in P2P!
