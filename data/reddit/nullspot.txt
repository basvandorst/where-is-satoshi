Received 782,558 - Final Balance 0.0002 
Note: I have no idea how to prove who this wallet belongs to. I leave that to better blockchain sleuths.

Whether you agree with the motivations of said hackers, OP totally called this price jump, moments before it happened. 15% up after a long slump sideways

I've done some wallet password recovery myself (common hazard when trading since 2013), and *yes* it could take a million years, depending on how much you know about the password, how good you are at writing the parameters for the brute force scripts to "guess", and how fast your hardware is.
The more clues you can provide GREATLY increases the chances of it working, as the challenge is to eliminate as many variables as possible before you start guessing.
I use the same cracking scripts that most experienced folks use (like that "Dave" link everyone's posting), it all comes down to how cleverly you can whittle down the options.
If you're interested, PM for details. I don't have a backlog of clients right now like some places, so I'll only ask 12% if I'm successful.

would seem the costs for "stress-testing" have come down a bit, and it's now trivial to spam the network

I'm a wordpress plugin developer. Nail down the exact features you want, particularly the arguments (1: amount [required], 2: currency [optional, default USD], 3: exchange [optional, default bitpay]), and I'll whip up a plugin for you.

...and I just installed Gyft for the first time and bought $150 of gift cards an hour before this announcement :(
oh well, still pretty stoked. So much quicker way to cash out than coinbase. Instant gratification!

Nope. Real shit: [

well if Fontas gets an invite, maybe there's hope for me?

I'll buy a copy of the book (paperback or epub), and will gladly sell it to you in bitcoin.
Problem solved.

to expand the scope of the project, said Captain Obvious, obviously...
Taking on major travel (compared to just hanging out around town) is an additional cost, but would add a lot of interesting material for the documentary.

I didn't include every last subreddit that mentions alt-coins, just the most active and useful ones.

Wow you guys rock! Actually, I loved the being able to quickly convert my coins into usable fiat cards for Target so much, I'll gratefully turn down your offer, and make one request: allow us to buy gift cards for bitcoin *within the iphone app!* 
Yes, the website experience was absolutely painless (thanks bitpay), but to have the ability while out an about to buy gift cards on demand  with the sweet app would be KILLER.

There's oversight, then there's government oversight. These two things are NOT the same.

Competition and diversity. A major reason for inventing bitcoin was to provide another viable currency option in the marketplace of the world - one that did what others could not, or at least did it better. Having a monetary monoculture of only Bitcoin is just as great a risk as having nothing but the US dollar. 
Like diversity in companies, products, people and organisms, having multiple viable options simultaneously existing is the best insurance against that which we *cannot* forsee...

yeah I noticed that, and yet gyft isn't providing a bitcoin wallet functionality, or even paying people with bitcoin - all we'd need is to be able to pay for our cards *with* bitcoin. Couldn't that be seen as somewhat similar to the gift cards themselves? like paying for stuff on amazon's app with an amazon gift card, instead of credit card or itunes account?

so far, I've been waiting a *week* to get my coins, as coinbase has taken days just to finally debit my bank, then days more after debiting to deposit my coins.
So how exactly does one get "Level 2 verified"?
