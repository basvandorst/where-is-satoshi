If anyone acknowledges limitations to using Bitcoin in real world scenarios, someone might find out and then the price won't go up.  As long as there existed a way for the person who lost their Bitcoin to have not lost their Bitcoin, it's still technically viable.

@_date: 2014-11-03 19:02:47
I didn't want to derail the discussion, as I don't anticipate much agreement, but sure:
* The orthogonal requirements of security vs. storing enough unique, physically-separated copies to avoid data loss.
* Unmanaged inflation/deflation.
* The competitive transaction fee landscape in a high-usage environment.  How much of a fee do you have to attach to a transaction you want included in the next block?  Similarly, the ability of large mining pools to manipulate fees / transaction times to maximize profit.
* The lack of consumer protections such as zero fraud liability and chargebacks.
* Pushing transaction costs onto the consumer rather than the merchant.
* Basic scalability:  at massive scale, a decentralized network can not process transactions at sub-second times without foregoing the underlying security of the protocol.  Google-scale resources will be required to store and query the full historical blockchain.
* The fact that the majority of all possible existing bitcoins are already in the hands of a small number of people.  Wealth inequality is already a concern for a lot of people, moving to a model with orders of magnitude greater inequality is not going to be greeted with enthusiasm.
* Privacy concerns over having anyone you ever do business with able to see every other transaction you make, both past and future.  This can be mitigated with a robust money laundering infrastructure, but that has its own problems:  most people strongly support the government's efforts to disrupt the flow of money to terrorism and child porn, so fully subverting anti money laundering efforts is not going to be attractive.
* Ease and irreversibility of electronic theft.
Note that these are the flaws in direct usage of Bitcoin by consumers -- one could imagine mitigating some of these by hiding all the Bitcoin stuff between large institutions and just mimicking the current banking / credit card infrastructure at the frontend, at which point the value proposition is gone.  Remember that most people aren't unhappy with the status quo:  Bitcoin has to provide a compelling upside with little downside to get people to use it.  I see the opposite situation:  limited upside with many significant downsides for most consumers.
@_date: 2014-11-15 03:16:09
Actually, it makes you guys look like assholes, using someone's misfortune as an opportunity to prosthelytize.  It's pretty obvious the way you're giving to him is entirely built around the ulterior motive of pumping up the price of Bitcoin.  Very Amway.

I love these claims of huge, invisible inflation. You do realize that you're claiming that the dollar in 2000 was worth 2x to 2.6x more than it is now?  Don't you think we'd notice if prices on cars and books and CDs and cereal and beer and clothing and bedsheets had changed that much?  Look at cars:  a new 2015 Honda Civic starts at $18,490.  At 7% inflation, the equivalent car would have cost $7,170 in 2000.  I bought a car in 2000 and I can guarantee you they weren't that cheap, unfortunately.

A deflationary economy would give far, far more power to the wealthy than they already possess.  People born into such a system without wealthy parents would be at their mercy, as their need for basic essentials such as food and shelter would force them to accept slave wages and pay high rents.  Even actions that were previously successful against overreaching capitalists, such as general strikes, would be far less effective once the wealthy can earn money even while factories sit idle and workers go hungry.
To say it would be a disaster is an understatement.  Many myopic Bitcoiners fail to consider the large scale consequences, thinking only of the growth of their own bank balances and an abstract feeling of fairness that such a system would bring.

It's fascinating how much the tone around here shifts as the price falls.  Bitcoin's utility or underlying technology is the same whether you can trade one for $300 USD or $3000.  But the people who are using it as a speculative vehicle to turn their USD into more USD act as if it stops working once the exchange rate goes down.  Shows what their real intentions are, I suppose.

The response to adoption by major merchants (Newegg, Overstock, Microsoft, Dell) is key data:  there hasn't really been one.

Bitcoiners themselves are barely spending them, because people don't spend deflationary currencies unless they have to.

No need to be fearful:  it's a 100% certainty that the general public won't use Bitcoin in its current complex form.  The general public doesn't reliably use secure passwords on their email or Facebook accounts and gets viruses all the time.  You think they're going to accept a currency that is so easy to steal and that offers none of the consumer protections that they're used to?  
I can't get my mom to back up her digital photos.  Now imagine if not only did she have to back up her money, but do it in such a way that every single backup was highly secured or else thieves could steal it.  And what's her motivation for giving up her FDIC bank account and liability-free credit cards again?  Saving merchants 2%?  The imminent collapse of the dollar?  She doesn't buy a lot of drugs or do a lot of international money wires, after all.

Everything is affected by the inflation rate of the economy's primary currency.  Investment, hiring, interest rates, prices, everything.

Not directly, since loans and donations are going to dry up (people don't give away deflationary currency), but from the knowledge that if they did have money, no one would be able to censor their transactions (provided they sent a large enough transaction fee).  The poor people hate the idea of their non-existent transactions getting censored!!

This is the biggest edge credit cards have, IMO.  The fact that you have both complete liability coverage and a window of time to review purchases for fraud before your bill is due is a hard consumer advantage to overcome.  I've stopped using my debit card for purchases simply because the nuisance of getting your money back if it gets taken is not worth the risk.  I can't imagine using something like CurrentC, I'm pretty sure it's going to be a huge flop.

Bitcoin didn't invent person to person electronic payment.  People have been able to send major content creators money directly for a long time, but they don't for the most part.  It's just human psychology.  If anyone could eat in any restaurant for free without getting caught, do you think restaurants would collect the same level of income?  It's too easy to undervalue a product you've already consumed, or which you don't *have* to pay a dime for.  Knowing you could have skipped out for free makes you feel like a saint when you pay a quarter of what the creator would otherwise ask.

In addition to your somewhat suspect credit card fee numbers (I believe 2-3% is the normal cost for any reasonable sized retailer), you're neglecting a few things:
1.  Merchants still have to pay 1% to Bitpay, making their total savings closer to 1-2%.
2.  Credit cards provide more value to consumers than Bitcoin does.  Smart merchants give customers what they want, they don't try to shoehorn them into something riskier to save a few percent.
3.  10% off is not exactly the world's greatest sale.  Consumers are routinely offered better discounts than that just to entice them to visit a site, let alone figure out how to obtain and use a weird new payment method.
The problem is that you're not playing up the strengths of Bitcoin, you're trying to mask the weaknesses to drive adoption and pump the price up.  That is not a recipe for success and no smart merchant is going to want to be a part of it.
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:37:20

What risk?  The card reader contacts the credit card company and confirms that the card is valid and that the person has sufficient credit left to make the purchase.  Yes, they have to wait to actually get the money but the credit card company are the ones handling the verification and assuming the risk.
This is one of the advantages centralization has over decentralization.  Because it's point to point, you can query a database much faster than you can confirm consensus across a distributed network.  I think it's unrealistic to assume that Bitcoin can compete on speed without modifications to the protocol, particularly if it had to run at Visa/Mastercard scales.  When you've got millions of transactions coming in every second, it gets complicated.

How many of the people currently throwing nickels around Reddit would be doing the same thing if Changetip just used dollars in its internal ledger instead of Bitcoin?  Answer:  zero.  Because you're right:  handing someone a nickel for saying something you like is stupid, and makes you look like a dick.  This could easily have been implemented dozens of times before this, but never has because there's absolutely no demand for it.  People go on the Internet to empathize with or insult or help or laugh at other people.

Bitcoin's main strength is the ability to accept money from anyone without a payment processor.  For companies who don't want to deal with the risks of hacking or who want USD, it's worth it to pay a payment processor 1% to handle the Bitcoin side for them.  
Still with me?  The OP is asking is Microsoft is going to start paying other companies with Bitcoin.  Given that Microsoft is using a payment processor, it's highly unlikely that they have any Bitcoin. If they were willing to hold Bitcoin, they would just accept it directly and save that 1%. So why would they go pay to obtain Bitcoin later? It would be like accepting SEK on your website, converting it to USD and then converting USD to SEK to pay someone else.  Why would you do that?  
It's not a big deal, but if one wants to answer the OP's actual question, the facts don't in any way support it.

It may be unlikely right now, but it's like building a skyscraper on sand:  if Bitcoin took off, who is to say that one of the big stakeholders might not dust off an old wallet and cash out?

Yes, for all other things being equal, a higher price increases the liquidity.  What I'm contending is that as the price is rising, the supply will be cut disproportionately as more and more people hoard to take advantage of the upward price momentum.  This will disproportionately decrease liquidity.

This is true.  At least until the protocol stops printing bitcoins to pay miners $20/transaction.  At that point, remittance is going to get a lot more expensive...
@_date: 2014-10-17 22:11:14


For now, while the community subsidizes miners to the tune of $20/transaction.  Which is great:  you can send some guy a penny on Reddit to prove some sort of point.  That won't last forever.
But you keep changing the topic away from the original point:  Bitcoin is mostly in the hands of very few people.  All the tap dancing in the world doesn't change that.  This is a very unattractive feature to anyone with the slightest ounce of social consciousness.

Quite the opposite, it is death to activity because it creates natural sinkholes.  Business slows down because people are waiting to buy things, so they lay people off or delay hiring, because those salaries earn the business money just sitting in their accounts.

@_date: 2014-10-07 02:03:00
I'm saying there isn't much money to be made, especially when you compare it to the current mining rewards.  Now fast forward to a hypothetical future where people use Bitcoin as a currency:  if the five top mining pools stop processing transactions below a minimum fee, confirmation times on fees below that are going through the roof.  They'll lose a bit of income at first but eventually come out ahead, because most people can't afford to just wait an extra three hours for their purchase to confirm and will up their fees to whatever actually goes through.
Why do you think this wouldn't happen?

It depends on whether mining continues to centralize.  If a handful of people control 90% of all mining, they can effectively set the minimum fee to whatever they want.  0.2 BTC = your transaction processes immediately (10-30 minutes).  0.19 BTC = your transaction waits until the other 10% of the network gets to it (hours?  days?)  
@_date: 2014-11-23 18:01:34
You guys are so in love with these analogies:  personal computers, email, the Internet, but they really don't apply to Bitcoin.  Money and electronic payment *already exists*.

That is probably overly simplistic.  If Bitcoin actually caught on and was widely used, control of transaction processing would become very powerful.  Groups of miners could easily flood the market with hardware, making it unprofitable to mine, and then once they control the lion's share of the transaction processing use that power to increase fees by simply refusing to process any transactions below a certain amount.  Anyone needing a rapid response would have to pay it.  Collusion is a very powerful and profitable force.

1.  People who think the dollar is secretly hyperinflating and about to crash.
2.  People who hate and fear the government.
3.  People who buy drugs, weapons and child pornography online.
4.  People who like speculative investments.
For everyone else, Bitcoin in its current form holds no advantages over the current system.  Most people like chargebacks and other consumer protections of credit cards.  Most people aren't afraid of the government hyperinflating the dollar.  Most people don't give a shit about merchant fees.
If we could cut through the ideology and cheerleading, it *might* be possible to identify improvements that could create an actual need for Bitcoin.  I'm not holding my breath, though.

This to me is the single most important issue facing Bitcoin.  There's no point in pumping it up and getting everyone to adopt it if it's just going to fall on its face once a ton of people are using it for real commerce.  And if it can't actually function without a bunch of centralized payment processors doing all the actual work, people interested in real cryptocurrency can get to work on designing one that can.
@_date: 2014-12-20 01:40:19
The only way miners can set fees is if they collude and agree not to process any transactions below a certain threshold.  I think the Bitcoin economy is still far too fragile for them to try this now, though.  It's only if Bitcoin went mainstream that this would be a serious concern (although at that point it would quite serious).

If Microsoft was willing to handle and hold Bitcoin, why wouldn't they simply accept it directly?  They have the technical chops to set up and manage a per user wallet payment system and not lose their coins to hackers, it makes no sense for them to support the technology yet pay a payment processor to accept Bitcoins on their behalf.  The only logical conclusion is that they're using Bitpay to support a Bitcoin payment option but get their money in USD.

I'm not claiming any knowledge here either, but I think it's silly to assume they're holding any Bitcoin without evidence.  Any big company willing to deal with the accounting headache of holding additional currencies isn't going to do it halfway, so I think it's a far more reasonable assumption to assume a big company using a payment processor is holding USD only.

It's not my first day on this subreddit.  People here for the most part are strongly opposed to hearing viewpoints that don't conclude Bitcoin's price is eventually going through the roof.  That said, I shouldn't have directed that comment at you personally and I apologize.
But anyway, it's not the speculation that's the problem, it's the fixed supply.  It causes hoarding, which is very dangerous for a currency.  Speculation drives the price up, more and more people hoard since they're making money just by holding, liquidity goes down, the price goes well past the actual market value until someone tests it and then it plunges.  Lather, rinse, repeat.

If I thought Bitcoin as currently implemented had any chance of replacing the dollar, like so many here confidently predict, I'd be pretty virulently opposed to it.  A deflationary currency with no consumer protections would absolutely destroy the economy.  I wouldn't like that.
Think about proposals that people worry might cause economic harm: universal healthcare, battling climate change, etc.  Those all keep the same system, but just *might* cause higher costs to some sectors.  And people go absolutely batshit about them.  If Bitcoin ever starts to look like there's any chance of it displacing fiat, that's when you'll see actual hate and fear.

Bitcoin will definitely go down in the history of computer science and economics as the first widespread attempt to maintain a decentralized ledger.  Bitcoin itself is not ever going to play a meaningful role in global payment.  There are too many fundamental flaws for it to be widely adopted by consumers, particularly once the high inflation rate goes away.  This doesn't mean the price won't bounce around a lot along the way, though:  the fascinating part of the distribution model is the way you can get highly deflationary behavior during periods of significant inflation simply from the promise of future deflation.  So your exchange volume ends up being a shockingly tiny percentage of the total supply, which can drive theoretical prices up to completely unsupportable levels.  This makes the price dynamics really interesting:  they're driven almost entirely by psychology and perception, and prone to all manner of manipulation.  We could just as easily see $5000 coins or $5 coins.
Five years from now, though, the transaction volume and exchange volume will be the same or smaller than they are now.  Without mass adoption, the get-rich-quick zeal of the community will eventually be overcome by the inflationary costs and general fatigue.  The effective price for a significant number of bitcoins will be effectively zero, but for small amounts it could be almost anything:  it will likely mostly just be hoarders exchanging amongst themselves, so the price will reflect their perceived value of their stash, not an actual market value.

All of which is counteracted by the hoarding:  if 99.9% of the coins are kept out of the daily economy, there is very little liquidity and high volatility.  Unlike the USD, you can't adjust the supply of bitcoins to control inflation and deflation, so hoarding can create artificial demand that can be rapidly undone by a small number of actors choosing to capitalize on it.
I know, I know, this doesn't help you get rich off the bitcoins you're hoarding, so I'm sure you don't want to hear it, but it's a real challenge for mass adoption.

1) *Your* total merchant fees might be 6%, but most retailers are in the 2-3% range.  The international reward cards are an edge case:  many U.S. retailers don't even accept them, so arguing that they can save 6% by giving everyone (domestic and international) 10% off is illogical.  
2)  The point is highly relevant:  you can't tout the cost savings of reduced merchant fees and ignore the additional costs of Bitpay.  And for smaller retailers, while they can potentially offer an extra 1% savings, consumers are going to be more hesitant to forego the consumer protections of credit cards than they would with e.g. Amazon or Newegg.
3) Ignore my third point if you want, but given how much you have to fudge the numbers to hit even 10%, it's worth realizing that even if you could hit it it wouldn't be the adoption magnet you think it is.  Knowing your consumer landscape is pretty critical.

That's what a free market is:  you propose a product or service, they look at it and decide the value it brings them is not worth the trouble/cost.

That's not inflation, that's a specific sector having rapidly rising costs that *outpace* inflation.  Other examples in the past decade include health care and oil.  Inflation is when all price tags go up by about the same amount due to the decreased value of the currency they're priced in.  Which, if the OP's claims were accurate, would include cars and jeans and coffee and lumber and canned peaches, etc.

Bitcoin has *zero* advantages over fiat for centralized remittance.  Moving money between branches costs a company nothing:  they can just keep an internal ledger and sort it out as needed.  All of the costs are in the infrastructure of maintaining storefront locations and converting between currencies.  Bitcoin doesn't help with those, it just introduces 1-2 more layers of conversion costs.
Where Bitcoin has unique value is decentralized reimittance, i.e. direct person to person transfer using the blockchain.  The challenge there is setting up a network of currency exchanges that will give you local currency for Bitcoin at favorable rates, and the fact that direct use of Bitcoin requires access to the Internet and a computer/mobile device, which many poorer people don't have.  Unfortunately, I'm not seeing how rebit.ph gets us any closer to that.

Well, if you dislike uninformed comments you may not want to read your second sentence, which is completely and totally false.  Decentralized currencies are significantly more expensive to run than centralized ones.  That's the trade off you have to pay to get the advantages of a distributed system.  Right now, the costs are hidden as the mining rewards get absorbed by hoarders, but those chickens have to come home to roost eventually.

But the money side was never the weakest link in the free trade chain.  People trying to force free trade (aka smuggling) have usually had a harder time with the goods / services end of things than the cash / payment end.  
And the money itself still has the major weak link of exchanges:  sure, you can send Bitcoins around the world without attaching personal information, but if the receiving party has to use an exchange to get them back into their local currency, you're back at the same level of anonymity as any bank transfer. 
Selling Bitcoin like this is like my ISP adverting 500 GB/sec transfer speeds, and then discovering that they mean only within the switches they control:  my upload is actually only 1 MB/sec.

I don't disagree:  I've actually long thought that Bitcoin's unique value proposition was in money transfer.  The problem is that most regular people don't do a lot of international money transfer, and those that do still have to find exchanges to convert the bitcoins back into something they can spend.  Those exchanges are the weak points:  in countries where money transfer is most desirable, the ability to convert money to bitcoins and vice versa will command a premium.

It will be interesting to see how the miners react to the price.

Obviously, people wouldn't send through a lot of 0.19 BTC transactions, that was just to illustrate the cutoff.  And whether your transaction would be in the first block found by the 10% would depend on whether cheap transactions were stacking up -- once a backlog develops, it could take quite a bit longer to process any given transaction.

This sub spends an enormous amount of time trying to convince itself that the price is going to start soaring any day now because money is coming into the backend.  It's not.

Yeah it actually is.  Look at the current ratio of exchange volume vs. total number of bitcoins.  People hoard deflationary currencies, they don't lend them out.


What fees?  Some dude driving a taxi gets paid in cash, he's not paying any fees whether he's in India or Indiana.  Whereas Bitcoin already has relatively high fees with heavily subsidized mining.  What happens to those fees in a hundred years?  
Also, even if cryptocurrency had the value to the people of the world like you say, why would Bitcoin be the solution?  Why not a new cryptocurrency with a more egalitarian distribution model and more sensible inflationary policy?

The network size and infrastructure cost has no reason to change the price.  From a consumer standpoint, the network is either secure or it isn't.  A bitcoin doesn't get twice as valuable when miners go out and buy twice as many computers, any more than consumers will pay twice as much for a plane ticket on an airline that pays its employees twice as much as their competition.  I want to get from point A to point B, your costs are not my problem.
Bitcoin price is fueled by demand, and the network infrastructure should grow and shrink according to that price.  It doesn't work the other way around.

You'll get bashed because you're using other peoples' tragedy as an opportunity to evangelize your get rich quick scheme.  Really crass, dude.

So right now, customers' options are:
1.  Use your credit card and pay an extra two pounds for the convenience.
2.  Walk up the road and use the cash machine for free.
And you think a good third option for them to give customers is:
3.  Somehow obtain hundreds of pounds worth of Bitcoin without paying more than two pounds in fees and use that pay for your room instead, hoping that the price doesn't drop too much between the buying and using part that you come up short.
Oh yeah, customers are going to love that.

By that standard, all advertising in win-win if you think the product you're advertising is good for the person you're advertising it to.

Most people on this sub don't care about actually using Bitcoin, they care about advertising Bitcoin so the price goes up.  They think Changetip will help with that, even though it doesn't really have anything to do with Bitcoin beyond denominating the amount in BTC.

So if it goes down to $26, that's still pretty good, right?  I mean, up 100% over two years, nothing wrong with that?

They'd throw you a naked lady parade but just when it was about to start your mom would wake you up for school.

This seems an easy claim to prove, then.  If what you say is true, there should be thousands of merchants who not only accept Bitcoin but give a substantial discount given its advantages to them over credit cards.  So...

If it makes you feel better, it doesn't actually use any of the beautiful technology, it just uses a simple central ledger.  It is just a chat room gimmick.

The politics of your ad don't align with those of most people.  You need to sell something people want or need (or think they want or need).  Bitcoin currently doesn't offer much in that department.
