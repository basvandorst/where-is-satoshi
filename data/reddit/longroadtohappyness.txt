People like you. I was stupid and sold on Ebay for a bit and lost out on $400 worth of bitcoin and chargebacks. I know it's funny to laugh about but not everyone should think like a scammer.

Yeah, I had bought a few from ebay too. It wasn't until I sold some that I ran into problems.

I don't know, maybe I have a problem with ripping people off.

Been there, tried that. It doesn't work. Paypal/Ebay will accept any and all chargebacks for BTC. I lost out on $400 and the BTC last summer selling on ebay.

Well mainly because not only did I get scammed, but the price of bitcoins plummeted. It wasn't profitable anymore.

Ok, I understand your point. I definitely was naive and it was my own fault for losing that money. Unfortunately that, combined with the ever increasing difficulty caused me to stop mine BTC and I now just ahve some to hold onto.

I was scammed out of almosr 1k over the summer selling bitcoins on paypal. It made me give up mining altogether.

I did for a little bit afterwards, the price of bitcoins plummeted and it was no longer profitable.

I have 2 5870's that run about 21 hours a day. I have been doing this since 6/13/11 and I got almost 3 from mining in my pool and another 10 on betco.in playing cards.

Don't, fucking scammers screw you with chargebacks. There is nothing you can do to stop it either.

Not Ebay. Don't use paypal if you don't want to get scammed. I got $400 in chargebacks from paypal and there was shit I could do about it.
@_date: 2011-06-26 03:52:37
Mines not in there either.

ME IRL. I could be a multimillionaire instead of a thousandaire.

I have had a paypal account go to collections for chargebacks do to bitcoins. I mean seriously fuck PayPal. They could care less about sellers. I lost out on almost a $1000 worth of bitcoins. That combined with raising difficulties caused me to stop mining and just sit on the bitcoins I still had.
