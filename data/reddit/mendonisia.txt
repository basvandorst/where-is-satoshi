Have you ever tried buying trading pool shares/contracts? I looked at buying mining shares vs buying trading pool shares and decided I had a better chance of making profit off market volatility than making a profit from shares in a mining pool. I don't see many posts talking about trading pools.
 I did a similar experiment like you and bought 10 shares and have been paid $64 in dividends. If I understood how to execute arbitrage trading I'm sure I could make more without buying into a trading pool but for those like myself who don't, it seems like a good way to profit from the market volatility.

I use Bitcoin Trader for my arbitrage trading pool investment. Here is a link to my comment re: detailed personal experience with them. 
as for btc-arbs their results look good but 2 weeks is no track record and to invest they say "Minimum Investment: $50 or 0.25 Bitcoins !" first off i wanna know where I can buy 0.25btc for $50 lol (lower that BTC on Gox) and if the math for the initial investment doesn't jive (even if they don't run off with your money) your daily % returns still won't match the actual market value of Btc to USD value. If you are interested in arbitrage trading pool opportunities try Bitcoin Trader  it has done good for me so far.... good luck

I bought 10 trading pool shares at $20 each (.2BTC at the time) they pay daily dividends on your shares daily which you can cash out at any time. I cash mine out at the end of each week. Week 1 I withdrew 0.01942029 BTC and Week 2 I withdrew 0.02184099 BTC. So far so good I think I have a chance at tripling my money if I stick with them for for a year. It has been quick and easy to withdraw I bought shares with btc and withdraw in btc. I'm not a big player and relatively new to this but it seemed like a good way to put some of my btc to work while the market bounces around. I never put all my eggs in one basket and never risk more than I can afford to lose and unless they run off with the money I can't see losing with this company.

Yep I found it's a great place to become more educated about Bitcoin.

It sounds good if I  had 5K I might consider it but the 20% of my trade profits seems quite steep. Have you considered selling trading pool shares and paying share holders daily dividends? I've bought shares on bitcoin-trader.biz and have been doing well but i would definitely support a US based company doing the same sort of trading pool... Just a thought.... good luck I think you will do well...

Switch to Wells Fargo they seem to be coinbase friendly from my experience.

I was just looking at this site today 
Here is a little info I copied from the website. I currently have a paper wallet but am going to switch to a crypto card pretty soon. Good luck.... 
Crypto Cards make Secure Offline Bitcoin Wallets...
Crypto Cards™ are made out a high density aluminum that has been coated in a protective and decorative oxide using electrolysis. Aluminum can actually be made stronger and more durable through a process called ‘anodizing’.
Anodizing also increases corrosion resistance and wear resistance, and provides a soft texture to the touch. More importantly, anodized aluminum won’t ever rust, corrode or fade like other paper wallets – which keeps your cryptocurrency safe in cold storage. All wallets laser etched... Crypto Cards are  BIP38 Encrypted...

LOL.... When BTC was $79 I told my wife I wanted to buy some BTC she thought it was a waste of money. On Thanksgiving the price had shot up to $1200 per BTC. While telling my father in-law the story over dinner he looked at my wife with a frown and said you shouldn't have listened to her! Later that night I told her that the next time BTC dropped in price I was buying some... When it hit $527 I did and I've been buying them every time we have extra money after bills are paid. To this day even though she knows i'm right she is still reluctant when I say it's time to buy some more BTC. I completely agree.... Disregard females, acquire cryptocurrency.
I talked to my father the other day and he had all kinds of questions about BTC. When we were done talking he said... as soon as I can convince your mom that we aren't throwing away our money I'm going to buy some bitcoin.... LOL! 
Disregard females, acquire cryptocurrency.
The bigger question seems to be how to attract females into buying bitcoin!
