Ok, but are you told what position those characters are in? Because the clue '19 out of 20' tells me exactly nothing if I don't know which 19 those are.
You also assume that the 'encryption' is a two way process, but there's nothing guaranteeing that. A cipher can generate random text, which means the encrypted text may have absolutely no relationship to the decrypted text. When doing test runs, I had ciphers that just returned "a", and those worked just fine, so even the assumption which is explicitly stated 'Password phrase is same length as the crypted phrase' may not be true.
There's no way to make this profitable for any one. Either the vault has weak ciphers, and the owner is wasting money, or it uses good ones, and the guessers are wasting money.

How simple? Can you do it with zero downtime?

You are AWESOME for doing this. Thank you!!!
I'll use my bits to tip others, if you'd be so kind!

I think it's a fantastic idea, and I hope you go through with it! 0.1 mBTC @_date: 2014-04-07 19:06:16
First of all let me say THANK YOU for this effort. We need more projects like it.
I was glad to hear you say you don't use floats for the balance/trading, but then I looked at the code...














I really can't stress to you enough how bad an idea this is. You're going to end up with rounding errors, and that will result in people losing money (either the users, or the operator, potentially both).
The correct way to handle this is to use integers, and anywhere where you may have a float value input from the user, multiply it by 100,000,000. If you want to display it as a float for the user, divide by 100,000,000, but DO NOT store numbers in the database as floats.

What you're describing is the need for a Futures market, where contracts can be traded on the future prices of bitcoins, ensuring a lack of price volatility for the length/amount of the contract.
I suspect we're precious months away from seeing such a thing.

But the dictionary isn't published. And the ciphers can be chained together.
So let's recap: You don't know what the key is, but we can probably assume [a-z], maybe [a-z,A-Z,0-9]. You don't know what the cipher is. You don't know how many ciphers there are, and you don't know what order they're in. And you can't offload any of the work in parallel. Oh, and each wrong guess costs you money.
You have a combinatorial problem who's solution space is literally larger than the number of grains of sand on the planet. In fact, if each grain of sand on the planet was another planet, you'd still have a solution space bigger than all the grains of sand on all the planets.
You're MUCH MUCH MUCH better off trying to crack Bitcoin itself: That solution space is MUCH smaller, and it would be more profitable too since each guess costs you only the computation power of checking it's correctness.
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:43:43
Yeah, I made the same assessment.
If I were to create a vault, I'd Copy-Pasta an AES encryption algorithm in, generate a few random characters with spaces for a passphrase so it looks like it could be words, and let them tear their hair out guessing.
If I were trying to crack that vault... I'd stop wasting my money and do something more productive with my time.
A strange game... the only winning move is not to play.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:23:09
Good, I hope I put a smile on your face.
I very much appreciate the irony in it all, which is why I thought it would be funny to make an open letter shaming you for shaming other people for shaming other people... I think I got that right.

I had EXACTLY the same thing happen to me last night, albeit with less BTC. Same pattern, where it went from one address to another very rapidly. The strange thing is by satoshi client still says I've got the BTC, so I'm trying to send it to a new address. I'm a little freaked out myself, do update us if you find any resolution! How did you send a ticket to blockchain?
@_date: 2013-06-21 04:19:13
It doesn't completely solve the problem. There's still a trail, from the original address, through the shared wallet, to the destination in the block chain. Blockchain shared send just adds a layer of abstraction, it doesn't completely break the chain. BixMixr does.

Hi there. I'm the author of the Dicer library, a Java library for interfacing with gambling sites and running bettings strategies. You can find the code here: 
So far I've lost about $10,000 proving that these sites will suck you dry. Go ahead, give it a shot. I've got a bunch of strategies in there for you to choose from. All of them end up with a balance in the fractions of a Bitcoins.
But somehow that didn't stop me. I didn't stop when I had lost my first BTC. No, I went and bought more, so I could try more strategies. Then I went and bought more to cover the prior losses. Eventually it got to the point where I spent all the money we had in the bank account and went looking for loans convinced that I could win it back.
Finally when the number hit over 10 grand, I realized I had a problem and had to stop. My son didn't get much of a Christmas this year as a result, and that was probablly what made me realize I had to stop.
So... if you want to learn what I learned the hard way, fork my repository and have fun. Just don't say I didn't warn you: It's incredibly easy to get addicted, and you have basically no chance of actually coming out ahead.

Just had a conversation with the guy. He was super nice about it, asked a few questions, and was very cool about everything. Best of luck in your endeavors, and I will await the release of your service!

Why is this a valid excuse for anything exactly? Why is it even being suggested here? Yes, in criminal cases you do have to reveal your identity to the authorities. So what?

Money is a ledger of transactions. Whoever defines that ledger best will inherit the Earth.

So, let me make sure I understand. I put my 1,000 dollars in, and it becomes 970 dollars. Then I purchase Bitcoins (let's say at 97 dollars a piece, so now I have 10 bitcoins. So I withdraw those, and they become 9.7 Bitcoins.
Of course I probably had to register my account with you, so this is no longer anonymous. I could have done this anonymously with another exchange... Camp BX can be funded with $1,000 for $1.55, and they charge a 0.055% fee for the trade, and withdrawing is free.
I really don't see how you're adding any value to the offering here. Why is a 'private dealer' (really just a middle man for the exchange) somehow better?

I was just discussing this 2 weeks ago over at the Feathercoin forum. Here's the link: 
tl;dr: You can use trusted hardware and deterministic computation to generate two transactions which could be used to lock the coins, and subsequently unlock them after a given timeframe. It requires you 'not knowing' the private key, as the time locked unlock transaction would serve as your private key, and it could all be done in a trust-less environment.

Well that's assuming bitcoincharts.com's data is accurate. Isn't there another feed we can use? Like the one from MtGox directly?

At first I felt sorry for him, but when I read the guardian article I had exactly the same thought.
You're liable for a bunch of people's money. Do you:
A) Alert the authorities and try and recover it?
B) Take the money and run?

This is very complimentary to some work I did a few months back to brute force brainwallets. You can find my breakdown here: 
Thank you for publishing your results, and keep up the great work.
@_date: 2013-11-08 10:09:46
Nope, still there. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 09:46:59
Oh I'm just using Casascius's tool, hacked together in about 20 lines to do the brute force. I'll definitely post it though when this is over.
@_date: 2013-11-08 09:26:45
Yeah, I'm using that to do a brute force as we speak. It's pretty slow, but it seems to be able to do at least 1 key a second or so, which is fast compared to what other people are reporting.

I gotta say I'm a little skeptical if it will actually make it to me, because it's basically a system with a single point of failure, and as an engineer, I can tell you Murphy's Law is valid with great sincerity.
Having said that, I'm excited to send it to Zagreb! I've never gotten to leave the states except to go to Canada briefly, so transacting directly with some random redditor in Croatia is kinda thrilling.

Hi, I'm the creator of this. I just finished this as well:  which is a web interface for this.

Can you give us some limiting range? Are they alphanumeric characters? Lowercase/Uppercase? Numbers? Punctuation? English characters? Anything that could help narrow down the search would really help.
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:21:32
Is this a currency exchange like MtGox? How will it compare in terms of features, pricing, and volume?
@_date: 2013-10-07 21:48:49
Well, the trusted hardware is only required for generating the transactions in a way that you can reliably ensure that the intermediate private key is destroyed. You can totally do this without the trusted hardware, but you won't be able to prove you didn't cheat. Once the transactions have been output, it's just a normal transaction that you can send to the blockchain using any client.

Super early testimonial here:
I've been tracking this since yesterday when I discovered it on the Bitcointalk forums. I sent a PM, and he got back to me saying the response was huge but I'm on the list. I also filled out the online form. Within a few hours he had Skyped me to let me know my store was ready, and he would walk me through setting it up.
And he did. First thing I got from him was a url to a Heroku app leading me to a WordPress setup screen where I put in some credentials. After that, he had me go through about 10 steps, doing things like enabling plugins, setting up navigation, and creating my first product. I think it took about 10 minutes, and I had my first product ready to be sold.
There's still more work to be done. I need to sign up for a Bitpay and put in my API id so I can actually accept payments. I need to go through and add products and upload images. I need to customize the site a little more so it doesn't just scream generic wordpress everywhere. I need to get my domain for the store registered, and get that figured out. He warned that this isn't production yet, and that will require more work like the Wordpress ReadOnly plugin which stores things on a S3 bucket (amazon's storage system, which I'm quite familiar with).
The steps we followed will be easy to document so anyone can do it. He said he was testing them out on me, and didn't want to keep me waiting while he wrote them up, which was cool of him to do.
All in all, there's definitely something to be said for this. Obviously it's still in it's infancy, but with a little more elbow grease and polish, this could be very powerful. I sent him 0.1BTC as a tip to encourage the good work to continue... I hope this turns into something huge.
Now, on to finishing administering my products!
