I'm nearing 50 years old now and entering my twilight and to be honest  I say the things I do from the bottom of my heart. What saddens me is not the fact that I get called names or downvoted but for the people doing it. I have one working eye, bad teeth and not much to brag about. Trust me, ego is a waste of time.

AFter the first $10 million in coin was transfered with great speed why in the FK did bitgo not CHECK what was happening? 
IF you withdraw RATE is 500% WHY NOT stop and CHECK b4 signing the entire business and industry away?  
NO way.. i am not buying that bitgo is this incompetent. I don't care what limits 'client' puts HARD Limits should at least PAUSE signatures FFS  I'm sorry but I smell organized crime here..

Better to 'socialize IOUS' and stay solvent and in exchange change  security by adding USER SIGS to the wallets for withdrawals. Users would go out of their way to promote Finex and the growth would cover the loss and IOUS repayed .. insolvency is not good approach.

Hacker/theif. please consider sending back all BTC but a bug bounty % to finex as you have negatively effected too many lives.
You are missing something very important. Something you assume to be true that is not. The lie is so grand I am not going to say it here 99% of people would lash out at me here.
nearly 1% over the last several years have discovered something and if you search hard on the internet you will find it along with shocking revelations of who you actually are.  
I'm not going to say what it is as you can research it as you are most certainly smart enough to find this truth. But what I'm saying is we know for a fact the universe is balanced and everyone reeps what they sow , eventually.  
I know how it feels to be a jerk to 1 person and how it can come back to haunt you. But what you have done is injured thousands. Is that really a burden you wish to carry?
We, the victims of your actions will survive but will you is the question? Think again hard and do the right thing.

"Germany's love of cash is driven largely by its anonymity. One legacy of the Nazis and East Germany's Stasi secret police is a fear of government snooping, and many Germans are spooked by proposals of banning cash transactions that exceed EUR5,000. Many Germans think the ECB's plan to phase out the EUR500 bill is only the beginning of getting rid of cash altogether.

I was just suggesting a smart contract could give a 'time to mute' transactions.  
Yeah of course if the customer has a key required for multi sig that would have solved it as well. Or if change of withdrawal address 'unknown address' require extra 2fa.  Or if bitgo had a hard limit outside of api direction.  
On Bitvc and simpleFx you have to 2fa to Add a new withdrawal address. What is wrong with this approach?
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:32:04
 alone is 14 million.. but are we sure this is the hack and not bitfinex moving it?

If 40 million people went to exchanges to buy bitcoin tomorow. yeah there would be a delay when transacting OUT of your bitcoin address (not that everyone does that immediately anyway) but that would mean the price of bitcoin would skyrocket and how hard do you think it would be to get concensus and  a stop gap block size bump while side chains are getting ready.  Not to mention if they could always park some in ethereum classic or monero... IMO the tech side is slow because of concensus. With huge demand consensus would be a no brainier and it would not be as contentious as it is now forcing issues with out an actual crisis. 
I don't think solutions would be far off.. weeks not months if we needed. Just my opinion but I'm just an app level dev so what the H do i know. Lots of genius out there than can figure out solutions that we can agree on. Demand is what is key.

I've said since day 1 the INITIAL huge OK coin dump WAS suspect.

But this one was WAMMO.

I do completely understand, I too lost and it hurts but lets focus on where to go from here. 
There is a shot that they can make people whole and get on to bigger and better business if we got behind them instead of sabotaging their efforts because we are all butt hurt. 
I agree with a most of the concerns people have but they are addressing each issues slowly but surely.  Why not give them a chance instead of beating a dead horse?
But my point is the personal attacks, childish name calling and generalizations are not helping anybody.  Even if a person has those opinions. How is that going to make anything better?

If I were the last signer (last line of defense) on a hot multi sig withdrawal to an unknown address I would simply have a HARD LIMIT set for manual auth if over 2 standard deviations of normal.   This doesn't stop theft completely but would  have stopped $55 million of it. 
How flippin hard would that have been bitgo?  What am I missing?

@_date: 2016-08-18 19:00:38
One idea, If your going to be buying 100 btc and your primary concern is market fluctuation then what you may want to do is go on an exchange and buy 100btc with leverage 5 to 1 or 10 to 1 depending on what you already have. Then your locked in.. That will give you a few days to sort out spot purchase.
Over 5 to 1 leverage gets a bit risky with bitcoin being more volatile than swimming with dynamite.

Yep totally they are opening themselves up from civil to now criminal liability. In fact I can't see how they nor bitgo would let ALL  $65million to be withdrawn in 1 day. This has to be intentional. Someone left the door OPEN!
Multi sigs are not multi sigs if one party blindly signs .. These people are not stupid they must have left the door open knowing they could get away with the fallout.  Now they are positioning themselves to  pit finex customers against each other by suggesting 'customer accounts' vs their own.. If they can not make good they do not have lawful authority to determine which creditor gets what.  If they are not criminals they should spread losses out and provide IOUs for the rest and look for a buyer with deep pockets that can clean things up.  Also what is bitgo going to chip in? You know Bitgo? the one who friggen SIGNED!!

Then for small amounts simply load the program up in ur browser, disconnect from the net and make an address.
For large amounts they can move that javascript based program to a computer which has no internet at all and run it from there. 
And if you run a hot wallet as a website just move a huge chunk to paper wallet and when your funds get low move some back. Not a complete fix but at least avoids a catastrophic breakdown.

Well after halving its not so easy to push down the price so panic must be created. I think there is a whale effort to push down price to pick up some cheap coins before the ETI's and ETF's get into full swing.

Why did BitGo sign $60million dollars of transactions without even so much as an ARE YOU SURE prompt?  
Why was the CFTC demanding Finex abandon cold storage and go for multi sig hot wallets? Plausible deniability? 
Political gain To push for centralized concepts of Mutability, KYC AML track and trace Problem Reaction Solution??
Speculation? Perhaps.

Many of us thought we had insurance via bitgo 2nd signature and their backup insurance which they had posted. If they blindly signed off to external addresses and if they didn't have insurance they should have clearly stated it.

What percentage of days transfer $10,000,000 of bitcoin to an external address?  Granted it might happen rarely and that is the point of withdrawal limits to external addresses.  You're not paying attention to security protocol which uses deviations of norms to trigger manual intervention.. this is security 101 baby. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:18:28
Externally? nope rarely! Yes for internal addresses probably.
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:17:02
I get it! That's why i call this a false flag op.
CFTC Gesner US gov involvement few months before prying the door open from cold storage to hot wallet, then instruct's bitgo to remove withdrawl limits.
Perfect storm created by cftc henchmen of the criminal banker cabal to first rob bitcoiners and 2nd discredit industry security.

It is estimated that bitcoin holders number less than 3 million people out of a population of 7 billion. That means we roughly make up 1/20th of 1 %.
It is in all of our best interest to drop this holier than thou attitude if we are to reach a broader mass in our society.  I'm 100% sure this community has the brains to resolve the challenges in front of us technically.
The big question is do we have the social skills and the maturity to value dissenting opinions?

We have to do a better job in patiently educating others to adopt bitcoin.

The reward is akin to inflation rate SIMPLE
All things being equal lower inflation means higher prices.  You guys are overcomplicating it.
Keep in mind at the same time Adoption is growing.. its not skyrocketing but it is indeed growing .. so now u have both sides working for btc.
And if you guys stop debating and being negative (seems to be so common now here) and just help others get involved we can ALL WIN ..  and end up with a nice alternative to fiat infinite supply currencies. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 17:57:53
Yeah HUGE BARRIER TO ENTRY LOL guess your one of those the title is talking about.. you can get bitcoin with a free wallet and 5 bucks!
Fiat currency has devalued since 1920's around 94.5% of its total value.. So just keep using money that shrinks!

For newbies.. do this;
  Before loading electrum make sure you are OFFLINE!
Then do your transactions and save signed transactions to a fileon usb. then close down electrum in fact REBOOT!
Take the file (signed transaction) and LOAD IT via online electrum wallet with your wallet as 'WATCH ONLY'  Then you can broadcast it.
So never use electrum when online UNLESS it is watch only address and instead broadcast signed transactions.

I think Federated side chains will be also very big comming in weeks! and Auto peg side chains will be bigger than both probably will be here by mid 2018 if core integrates some 'soft forkable' changes. Auto peg side chains gives some of the gains of LN but you really only need to open one channel (so to speak) to the side chain rather than many channels on LN NO? correct me if I'm wrong.

I doubt anybody will take the time to reply.. I really have no luck getting any help for people on reddit. Hey I give it out when I can but can't get it.  In fact i might give up ever posting on reddit. Nobody reads it and there is a vibe of ANTI FREEDOM even on this bitcoin channel which is better than 99% of other reddit channels in this regard..
Too many people 'MAKE EXCUSES' for why humanity is justified in controlling other people's behavior.  (no injured party = no crime ) 
I know lots gonna knee jerk and say there are a lot of freedom lovers here especially on this channel.. but My point is Few (5% or less) go far enouph.
For me 1 human controlling another CAN only be justified by true crime of an 'injured body' So its 'like' debating tax rates instead of the morality of taxes.
I want freedom not liberty. If we can't agree on this humanity and bitcoin will not make it.. It's a slippery slope gents.. It's time to get real and battle back.
I hope you all that understand the power of people power'd money and sacrafice like I am supporting network with nodes (not just mining for greed) and taking the time out of your day every day to CLEAR up the endless FUD and misunderstandig on the web.  I'm no saint but I am TRYING MY BEST..

Look at this post and this comment half way down the page of  I was thinking this might be a weapon before I stumbled accross this comment on bitcointalk.
edit.. below probably a skew in some of the details, nevertheless the overall concept seems plausible.
"Ripple is a secret weapon of banks against crypto currency! States and banks through ripple want to seize and destroy the crypto currency with the entire crypto currency market! This crypto currency is a scam of states and banks. For several years Ripple will eat all the main crypto-currencies - this is the black hole of the crypto-currency market, launched by states and banks. The total capitalization of the crypto-currency market will grow insignificantly, but the Ripple capitalization will increase due to the exhaustion of money from other crypto-currencies. When banks artificially depreciate the main crypto-currencies using Ripple, then there will be an unrestricted release of the Ripple (because of its centralization) and the owners' funds will also be depreciated with the help of huge inflation, and subsequently unlimited emissions Ripple will be completely eliminated. The crypto-currency world will be devaluated and discredited with the help of the governments of the world. After any operations with the crypto currency will be pursued by the state under new and very strict government laws.
Tell this to as many people as possible. If we all do not stop this state monster, the world of crypto currency will be destroyed!
The main difference between the virtual currency XRP, created by the state-owned company Ripple, is that this digital currency can not be produced. There are currently no pools or miners for XRP mining. Coins of this crypt currency are produced, in fact, as banknotes on a printing press. The release of these tokens is not limited to anything, as a result of which they can be infinitely many.
The main function of the XRP coin is to carry out interbank operations to transfer funds.
Based on this, it can be concluded that XRP is a centralized virtual currency with unlimited emissions, created and used by the banking system. At the moment, events are important in the world of virtual currencies. Many owners of banking institutions claim that bitkoyn is a soap bubble, and we are trying to reduce its popularity, as this poses a threat to their sphere of activity. At the same time, many understand that direct opposition to the Bitkoyn network can lead to the complete collapse of the financial system. Therefore, it was decided to introduce a new digital XRP to the market. At the same time, members of the banking sector did not come up with anything new.
The digital currency of Ripple was integrated into the virtual currency market using all their capabilities. The integration process occurred in several stages, which caused a gradual dependence on members of the crypto-currency community. At the same time, the essence of the currency remains similar to the US dollar. Thus, all the banks of the world have united to fight bitkoyanami and created their own currency wave. In the end, after uniting, they got a much better chance of winning.
All news about this digital currency is released exclusively positively, all user requirements are met. In addition, the issue of coins is not limited. And because of the increase in the value of the coins, they quickly bought up, although they did not suspect that for the money received with the help of financing, users buy conventional candy wrappers created by bankers who do not have security. After the huge issue of Ripple will be destroyed private user assets! Crypto currency of the whole world will be discredited! Ripple will be used only by interbank world blockbuster. It will be announced to the whole world about the collapse of the crypto-currency market and it will never be reborn.
Ripple Customers According to the data published on the official portal of the company, the branches of the organization are located in such cities as: Sydney, Luxembourg, Singapore, New York. The client base of the company includes more than 100 customers located in different parts of the world. Ripple's clients are financial institutions from Europe, North America and Australia. In 2017, the banking institution Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, which is considered Japan's largest financial institution, has about 90 offices in all countries of the world.
In addition to the above, the company takes part in the program "Digital India", in which the largest banks of the country participate. Ripple also officially works with Chinese banks.
Also recently, an international payment network used by residents of many countries under the name American Express was connected to the Ripple network.
Based on the above information, we can say that Ripple is an organization actively promoting the technology of the distributed registry in the banking sector.
Tell this to as many people as possible. If we all do not stop this state monster, the world of crypto currency will be destroyed!"

fees should be fine but you are missing the broader points;
1. we pay to secure the network. Right now that price is via inflation via miner rewards.
2. We can change the protocol to properly secure the network in the future as 'change' to the protocol would have 90% conensus GIVEN your dire scenario OR ANY OTHER scenario of diminishing incentive doom.
The only thing we can't change are things which are contentious.
Any real 'doom' weather it is incentive related or quantum computer related or anything removes any contention and allows us to change the protocol to solve any problem.

There was a site a couple years ago listing over 100 of the largest bank. Each listing had the top Execs listed along with ethnicity gentile or jew. 93% had a jew in 1 of the top 2 positions.  Surprisingly enough out of the 93 about 6% where sephardic (i.e. orthodox not the zionists)  I just point this out incase people think its some conspiracy.. NO ITS MATH!  
The true conspiracy is that very few sephardic jews are attacking the world in this total tyrannical control and monopoly banking. What I found is true 'hebrew' jews were much more compatible to our 'free market, and freedom' system.  So I dug deeper uncovering the secrets of the hebrew language itself and how empowering it was ( I wont get into it but long story short 'hebrewism' hides many secrets to our relationship with god )  As you dig deeper you find out our entire banking sector and media are run by Satanists calling themselves jews who are not even semetic. (We also have major studies DNA to back this up) So don't anyone dare to wipe this off as a conspiracy.. But if someone does I will go forth and make a list of the most orwellian communist satanic control mechanisms in our world today and you will see they are all a part of this satanic (literally) cabal 'calling themselves jews'

Tethers are printed and destroyed to keep the price pegged to the dollar.  
So if someone buys 1 million dollars worth of tether they have to print more tether so it stays pegged. Opposite is true when they sell tether.  Tether is **NOW** backed 1 to 1 with the dollar so people saying otherwise are misinformed.  If they print tether it means more money is available to buy crypto and is bullish. But when they actually do the transaction it puts downward pressure on the tether and it must be destroyed to keep the supply demand in balance so it remains pegged.

"Although an instrument of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself "an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government" i.e. ITS PRIVATE!
Private bank talking shit against its competition pretending to be government! IF your Government is 'democratic constitutional republic' it should be on your side.. IF the Gov takes the side of the fed and hinders your PRIVATE OWNERSHIP RIGHTS then they are captured by the private banking cartel and are committing treason which is punishable by death.  Either the private banks buy in and provide services like everyone else or they go extinct. 
They still have an advantage of being able to print unlimited amounts of fiat and by crypto to hold on to vast power but their hubris will probably lead them in an attack mode using government to attack it's own citizens as usual.

I could list and might list All the major critics of bitcoin and you will find MOST are Jewish.. You'd expect 2% of the critics to be jewish if it were representative of the population. 
IF you are good and peaceful that that's fantastic and I must confess that I am worried about guys like you for what the Jewish 'political establishment' is doing.    Remember I could careless about your faith or skin color or anything but when all the meme's put out by jewish leaders and bankers are 'I AM A CRIMINAL' and trying to incite the masses to support this concept so that the State can cage me, lynch me , or tax me???

Fantastic comittee hearing covering all the main points. Andreas does a great job fielding questions.   Ironically was rewarded, after the fact, many bitcoins from users who appreciate this type of activity again showing bitcoin goes WAY BEYOND a currency or an asset. This is indeed a network.  His talk and q&amp;a is spine shivering enlightenment however one question he had to 'repeatedly' field was about 'regulating criminal activity'. As this is the main fear point of those entrenched in legacy centralized organizations.
I think we need to remember and pass on the simple fact that Policing crime can still continue without making bitcoin it's bitch.
i.e.  Use normal police work if we're legitimately trying to go after criminals, because anything else would lead to political criminalizations or non crimes and result in censorship and more tyranny.   
The hard pill to swallow for centralist, statists and monopoly bank cartels is this network will not be used for CONTROL!  instead it is used for security of the individual.
If a crime happens it's not clicking send on your phone, so USE OTHER EVIDENCE of injury i.e. dead bodys forensics and guns. If it's not legit and just about making crime impossible, then kill everyone.  
'spy on you for your safety' is not going to fly as this makes us less secure as has been prooven.

I'm so tired of seeing it.. IT makes me want to puke honestly so I am being emotionally stressed seeing attacks on freedom to OWN and TRANSFER assets privately. 
If we can't use the legal system to remedy the constant fake news then eventually it will get to the point where someone more balsy than me will start assasinating these people.

Yeah overblown, however, it's still bad and what is the real FEAR UNCERTAINTY AND DOUBT that i c is a massive public that is fine with NO PRIVACY, presumed guilty until proven otherwise, forced taxation on and on.  You may think it sounds reasonable but this is not how free societies operate, it's the new normalized Orwellian slave mind set. OPPOSE anti privacy regulation and legalize freedom.  If you are caught doing a crime then and only then can society fry your ass. Precrimes mentality is a nightmare and is the opposite of the crypto mission.  Tracking means CENSORSHIP that is the bottom line. If a small interest group (banking cartel and gov henchmen) can track the population then blockchain will be used against us and we will live the a nightmare of cashless society that the fringe researchers talk about. Right now the blockchain can bring us freedom or it can enslave us and it all boils down to privacy/censorship. start pushing back pls.

Means real coins not futures and leveraged buys.
The leverage is what throws this all out of wack because this is what they may be using as a quasi fraction reserve.  They are only at risk if market moves faster than they can liquidate which we have seen happen like okex recently in which case they will socialize losses. but for the most part they can distort supply and demand playing games with leverage.

because they want to be able to stop it's use for anything THEY DEEM TO BE ILLEGAL. lol
So like if your alex jones reporting on corruption they can just BAN/FREEZE him.
This is so bad that the fox is guarding the henhouse.
we have to STOP TRUSTING the criminals that run this world.
I just listened to a 1 hour talk from an x cia agent who was contracted to blow up the Oklahoma building. The dude is totally legit and laid it all out, naming names etc.. it's completely blown wide open now and we are left staring at the fact that LEADERS , FEDS , COURTS are completely run by psychopaths and regulators are and have been utterly captured. 
Now with corporates BAN/CENSORING  and their collusion just imagine how they will attempt to censor every crypto that they can when the time comes.  If you so much as sneeze at the criminal establishment you will be censored and blocked from your own crypto.

It is bitcoin!  What it does is delays settlement allowing transactions without having to go to the main ledger unless there is an issue or settlement is needed. LN allows bitcoin to practically scale infinitely while still retaining the security of POW.  Block size **can now be increased slower than the improvement in internetwork infrastructure** (bandwidth, storage and propagation times)
Bitcoiners were not opposed to block size increases but rather bocksize increases that outpaced internet standards.  Now we can literally scale world wide and people can use lightning to do transactions and the main chain to transact larger amounts and where multisig and smart escrows are required. Simply Breathtaking!

Step 1 make electrum walet on a computer / os you will switch offline (no wifi)
Step 2 transfer btc to it's addresses
When you go to spend do this;
step 1. on a WATCH ONLY ONLINE electrum  make a transaction and SAVE IT to flash drive
step 2. on OFFLINE computer load the flash drive tx in electrum
step 3 sign the tx from offline electrum and save SGNed tx back to flash drive
step 4 put flash drive back in online computer and LOAD FRROM ELECTRUM THERE and broadcast.
1. it's hard to get a keylogger into an offline box and 
2.  even if it had a keylogger what good would it do if that computer can never hook up online?
Raspberry pi works really well in this scenario as you can get them with NO WIFI at all.

People don't care about freedom anymore, look at how they flock to ripple.  This community used to be full of freedom lovers, libertarians and anarchists but with this price increase we now are inundated  by the masses who unfortunately have very little principles beyond what is in it for themselves. LN is a great solution for bitcoin while keeping the main net and underlying asset decentralized but to be honest.what does it matter anymore. Decentralized power and individual freedom is not a concern among the hordes of me me generation. I really feel like puking to see attacks and FUD on LN while ripple, a known bankster coin no better than paypal soars. I truly hate this world and where the selfish hordes are trying to take this narrative.

Government is violence and force plain and simple.
If they keep on attacking people my bet is eventually they will be assassinated. I think people are really done being forced to give money under threat of being caged or killed. Eventually there will be blow back.
If government and taxes and all that stuff that statists believe is good, were actually good for us, then IT WOULD BE VOLUNTARY. 
Right now governments are acting as terrorists for banking monopoly men. They are terrorizing people.  think about it a bit.. The only reason people pay taxes is THEY ARE SCARED NOT TO!

Jones is wrong about 5% of the time which is way better than main stream media. Just most people can't stomach how it effects their programmed minds. Nobody likes to face bad news.
He was attacked heavy after sandy hoax comments but what boggles my mind is there was ZERO forensic proof available for anybody (no photos no death certificates nothing) yet everyone attacks him cause he says it was fake? Well then why not simply make available the evidence that it happened to stop the speculation?  No they did the opposite they passed SPECIAL laws to deny evidence from being public like it had been since the beginning of time.
The message they are sending is 'investigate crimes' and you get labeled a wacko and banned from social media and banks etc.  
Did anybody die at sandyhook? Who knows THATS THE POINT.. they made it impossible to verify and scrubbed all the evidence under a pretext of protecting the victims families.  It's crap.. they could pass a law to stop it from being posted online but make it available for any researchers to go into the municipality and see the records for themselves.  That would have killed the speculation in it's tracks..  THEY DIDN'T and for me the possibility of faking mass shootings and not allowing anybody to see the evidence is mind boggling. Then to see the savage masses attacking people who question it and it's plain to see that MIND CONTROL in this country is in full swing.

True dex is what we should aim for.  It's really a race to own coins at this point. They can accumulate from trader coins with these moves but not hodlr coins. Again another reason to buy and withdraw to wallet. It will dry up then they will have to buy spot if they wish to control markets.

During the first half of the 2000s, there were more ethical lapses at Goldman:
In 2002 it was fined $1.65 million by the industry regulatory body NASD (now FINRA) for failing to preserve e-mail communications.
In 2003 it paid $110 million as its share of a global settlement by ten firms with federal, state and industry regulators concerning alleged conflicts of interest between their research and investment banking activities.
That same year, it had to pay $9.3 million in fines and disgorgement of profits in connection with federal allegations that it failed to properly oversee a former employee who had been charged with insider trading and perjury.  
In 2004 Goldman was one of four firms each fined $5 million by NASD for rule violations relating to trading in high-yield corporate bonds; Goldman also had to make restitution payments of about $344,000.
In 2005 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that Goldman would pay a civil penalty of $40 million to resolve allegations that it violated rules relating to the allocation of stock to institutional customers in initial public offerings.
That same year, it paid a fine of $125,000 to NASD for violating rules relating to the sale of restricted securities during initial public offerings. Shortly thereafter, it was fined $140,000 by NASD for late and/or inaccurate reporting of municipal securities transactions.
In 2006 Goldman was one of 15 financial services companies that were fined a total of $13 million in connection with SEC charges that they violated rules relating to auction-rate securities. In another case relating to auction-rate securities brought by the New York State Attorney General, Goldman was fined $22.5 million in 2008.

and? your point?
With ln and other options viable merchants will storm in to accept bitcoin.
Do you know how many merchants take paypal? Did you know what percentage of merchants can't stand paypal?
As a previous merchant accepting paypal I can tell you personally they are one of the most SCUMMY outfits around. Charge backs,to  frozen accounts, high minimums..
STFU about no place to accept it. That will end too.  Also merchants look at quarterly's not day to day like the pleb consumers. meaning they are better off holding btc than converting.
Short term btc is volatile , long term it's a no brainer. Any merchant that kept retained earnings in bitcoin for longer than 6 months would be ahead of the game barring 1 month in 2013 and 1 month in 2018.
I'm so entirely sick of 'it won't get adoption' meme from nocoiners.

All makes sense to me.  Who in the right mind would be buying bonds with the fed planning on raising rates 3 more times?  Certainly no investors I know!  
 
Central bankers propping up markets until they are  ready to give it back to the free market.  BTC will boom soon and then bond market will eventually be open to free markets where the yield curve will invert and that's all she wrote for the hyper inflated stock market.  
FYI what we are witnessing IS NOT CAPITALISM at all.. so when this crisis starts don't you dare say its a 'capitalism' failure.. Central bankers and the captured regulators in government are NOT friends of you and your economy and are anti FREE MARKET.

This is true especially for merchant acceptance as well HOWEVER
I had a youtube channel where i pointed out that 90% of people are irresponsible and its getting worse not better. People are reeactive not 'response able', it's simply too proactive for most. The mass, top down subtle , but prolific mind programming has taken its toll and make us into sheep like some dystopic novel.  To be responsible you must buck the trend and in general people follow. The masses will enter bitcoin when annual ROI levels out to under 9% per anum.

FYI its not like we are going to get rich off of charging pennies, this was more of an example test of something cool we could do.  I had plans to also allow people to donate satoshis to the vids they liked that stream in their page which solves youtube content authors problems of monetizing.  So many possibilities but NO LOVE ?

i Just did a video about this 
This is going to be a debt based collapse and flight to safety will be flight to SOUND MONEY. Only Gold and Silver offer that OTHER than btc. However gold and silver are inflationary hedges so they will havedeto bottom out first probably $600 to $900. The ONLY sound money that will not be blasted by deflation is BTC because it's market cap is so small.  If the market cap of BTC were 5T BTC would perform more like gold however when you are scaring 150T (stocks,bonds, currencies) chasing $100Billion I can gaurantee BTC will sky rocket.
FYI I was a licensed stock broker and author of portfolio optimization software back in the day.

This is not how he started out at all so I have to think ' someone twisted his brain or other things'

oh.. why is ETF delayed? basically it would ALLOW you to hedge your 401k BEFORE and during stock market collapse to real value asset instead of debt based assets like fiat.. They can't have that!

So it's easy I just downloaded, installed and put in some info and made an offer to sell a small amount.  The only bad side of bisq is there are not enough people there. 
It's so amazing that people bitch and complain about exchanges and all the hoops we have to jump through just to buy and sell (no longer a free world..more like an Orwellian nightmare), yet so few will be a part of the solution.
I will leave my offer up (make sure you leave bisq running in a window) It doesn't take much bandwidth or cpu so no problem there.
As localbitcoins is now beginning to invade our privacy under the guise of law it's time we make other trading channels.
No matter what they say or come up with , remember we HAVE THE RIGHT to trade with each other. So many people are brainwashed to think "THE LAW"  is god.. But if "the law" said having sex with your spouse is illegal would you OBEY?
As long as you don't 'injure' another person with your behavior you are NOT committing a crime. Please keep this in mind that there is a principle called corpus delicti (body of evidence) that requires an injured party for an actual 'CRIME' to have taken place.  So bureaucrats can't just pass law that drinking water or making dinner is illegal.  
If we just keep going along their slipper slope and everyone just gives them their ID upon request then bitcoin will not become fungible. Can we have freedom or should we just roll over and hand over all self control to some dude selected by an elite class to make sure you don't get ahead?
Can we NOT be violent and DEMAND or civil society is VOLUNTARY? instead of giving in to the lie that the state must use violence to protect us from our neighbors violence? 
Can we get real and become proactive and break away from the chains?  OR are we just sheep that follows a small group of technocrats right over a cliff while singing kumbaya?

Yeah to some people they call that 'centralizing' lol it's wild how hated the 'user' is.  In fact segwit and lightning etc would allow for plugs in to centralized structures while protecting the decentralized nature of the chain.  It's beautiful cause there is nothing wrong with smaller transaction niches becoming centralized to fill niches. What we don't want it the main chain to centralize.  This is really a way for bitcoin to plug into the existing money structures without risking central control. if you think about it. Maturity of bitcoin! Would make it a major asset class comparable to gold but with liquidity.

Why I'm upset is.. you see over and over again 'why is adoption slow' it's because comments like yours that I am not qualified to play in your sandbox.  Look at how elitist your comments are?  You suggest simply because i wish to use a 3rd party it is less 'secure' and my sites will somehow be the detriment of the bitcoin.  Your  ego uses twisted logic to attack people for saying the truth.  
Running my own bitcoind and interfacing with that opens up a lot more risk than making a secure connection to a 3rd party where smart people like yourself can do a better job than dumb average minded folks like myself.
All I have been saying is 'when we cater to the more average folks and let them easily do common tasks that would be more beneficial towards adoption.

Whoaa with etf and a market crash.. it would be most certainly used as a hedge and quintuple in value. In fact if you see the ETF rise first before the market hit panic mode. question is how much new money would stay in BTC after markets settle down. probably a lot but not nearly all the gains. A drawn out sp500 Bear market would do much better for BTC etf. And the fun part is since this crash to come will be deflationary when they go to correct it suddenly we will see inflationary in the market and it will drive btc up even higher along with gold and silver. Right now if the markets deleverage (will happen eventually this year) metals won't do so hot until market bottoms. But btc is so small its both deflationary and inflationary hedge.

You can tell by the TITLE its FUD and not productive. and its CRAP I have experience zero slowdown on transactions with normal fees .. wow what a nightmare 150 transactions in last 7 days no hitch! plus we got v12 and with segwit almost 2x in near future.  Bitcoin will remain the base crypto but it wont be the only one.. If it were the only one the price would got to $250,000 per btc however with other layers LN's side chains and alt coins my guess is we will only see $50,000 per coin (3 years or less) Still if people can't see how this is all a fear campaign they are just clueless.

By skin in the game I mean BITCOIN in each mining node. That would solve the botnet issue wouldn't it? Skin in the game of miners is not to the benefit of bitcoin. The node which verify transactions is indeed benefiting the network however for mining their Gigantic investments is caused by trying to dominate market share! Souping up computing power only causes difficulty to go up and plays no purpose in benefiting the blockchain.  The 'security' of the blockchain ironically is 'decentralization'. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:25:41
Bitcoin assumes all partys act in their own economic interest and they don't use criminal behavior to get there i.e. stealing your neighbors computer or electricity to give you an advantage.  Or at least that this theft does not occur on a massive scale. For that we may need to put various solutions in place quickly. 
Faced with this threat it's best that nodes operators become responsible for a RAPID upgrade at any given time should we be faced with situations outside of economic incentives. 
If you run a full node please give your commitment not to wait many days or weeks to upgrade your software.

Yup down $5Billion but that doesnt bother them.. LIke I said for weeks. its not even about money for them as if it were it's suicide. It's about destroying bitcoin. POW is fine with me if it comes to that or even pre-preemptively.  1 bitcoin= 1bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:31:55
The good thing however is that now most bitcoin are awake to the fact that 1 or 2 men can hijack the entire thing thanks to misplacing power behind the centralized mining cartel instead of behind the market.
No crypto currency should be beholden to a NAME. Otherwise lets just call it Christine Lagarde coin.
Since miners are STILL debating and distorting facts for further central control it may be time to completely remove the profit motive out of mining. 
Confidence will be restored one way or another bitcoin will be free of coercion. 
Too all you miners out there. you serve the chain not the other way around. If you can't serve the chain you will be fired! 
Don't blame users of bitcoin, exchanges, markets or nodes blame one man Jihan or whoever is behind him.

Question , if AFTER a fork you send btc to an exchange and the tx is replayed won't bu still end up in the exact same address of the exchange? 
What is the easiest way to split your coins? I only have a core node and have no more CAPACITY to add extra node (ironic isn't it)
If you have a paper wallet what is the best way to split it? Electrum instructs are too difficult. I'd be afraid of getting it wrong.
I wish there were a service like shapeshift that simply splits it for me  import priv key--&gt;Btc--&gt;splitshift--&gt;btcc/btu. they would have to be trustworthy oh man what a mess.

lending rates and the price of money should be determined by the market.
But bank profits of a MONOPOLY bank should definitely go to the treasury and offset taxes.. This happens to some extent but the system is definitely rigged to be an 'implicit tax'  
TAX itself is really VIOLENT unless they make it voluntary.
Unless we face this fact society will be participiating in enslaving itself to some extent.  We need to make VOLUNTARY TAX system RIGHT NOW and switch to that when ready.   Government can continue where it is compatable with the peoples VALUE.  
voluntaryism is the only system without slavery. We should try it.

its not black and white.. its not all or nothing people get some perspective.. this is fantastic news for btc.. side chains and alt coins can take overflow and btc becomes gold and higher ticket transactions.. that way nothing is compromised and you shift your spending cash to chains that are built for speed cause you can take the risk with smaller amounts.. IT ALL WORKS if you just let it and stop thinking we have to DOMINATE THE WORLD WITH 1 CHAIN. Thats the old way of thinking.. bitcoin doesnt need to have 100% of the crypto currrency market to reach $40,000 per coin! Doing some quick math on market capitalization My guess is 20% of crypto in the base btc currency wed be worth 40,000 per coin within a few years and for POS and MICROtransactions we use other popular currencies that balance their goals towards speed etc..

Core node is the wallet. so no.. to separate your coins you got to run both 'node wallets'  try 'electrum' there you can choose a node to connect to and access both coins.. but after fork you got to send on both chains at same time to avoid replay attack. using RBF for core so that it splits it.

Just look at this failed logic "Bitcoin is incredibly secure because you need vast amounts of equipment and electricity to influence the bitcoin blockchain's concensus rules" 
Large equipment is not what makes it secure in fact it makes it less so! What makes bitcoin secure is decentralized power. I don't mind people having a different opinion but it's obvious people are in total denial on so many fronts I'm not sure the future is bright.

basically i guess you send your coins using RBF (on core electrum server) with very low fee to yourself and on BU electrum server let BU reject it then bump fee (not sure how to do that exactly where is the 'bump' button lol) so core accepts it. Then check to see if tx is on both chains. if not its split??

side chains and lightning and channels are the answer to scale 'all the way' it's just a matter of not compromising security from what i gather. But keep in mind bitcoin will never serve 7 Billion and doesnt have to. A dozen or more alt coins which serve that purposes from branding to speed, which fill niches and tradeoffs.. they will pick up the slack.  Just consider micro transaction.. there is really no reason to have much of that on the chain per se IMO ..

Basically if you want to control bitcoin BUY IT!  
Owners control. Miners Profit.
That's free market.
The other way (that it is now) it's nearly the antithesis of Free Markets. 
I will let you guys throw labels at that one.. as there are many. 
Network weak.? Increase mining reward formula
Network overly redundant? decrease reward formula.
The issues of POS are more to do with aggregation of wealth so 
this system would be the best of both worlds no?
Isn't game theory be much more powerful in the hands of the equity holder rather than the contractors?

MSM Media is a criminal propaganda racket .  I say criminal because it violates the Smith Mundt Act.  Right now nobody gets prosecuted as the sate is supporting propaganda after the bogus repeal of the Smith Mundt act. Main Stream Media along with silicon valley censorship is now a 'clear and present danger' to the Republic's of many western countries. Barring a Coup however nothing will change and since the last government fired 8 of patriotic generals nothing is likely to happen but more deep state lies.
Hold on for dear life - was actually invented to SMEAR bitcoin intentionally to replace the original meme with a negative mean as an attack on decentralize crypto.

Nice try but in crypto it's exactly how it plays out. Maybe not tick by tick but week by week price discovers exactly that. 'the best technical solutions' that fill niches.  Whether the niche is storage of value or payment networks or privacy.  I'm really tired of your posts claiming to know what the market want's and spreading your anti fundamental twists.  I've been trading since 1986 and am published in college text books. I've written software that consistently beats Harry Markowitz portfolio frontiers.  You sir have an agenda or don't understand markets. I see it all the time in reddithow technical chartboys  and know it alls continually spew anti fundamental rhetoric to protect their positions. It's getting sickening.

Maybe I am giving them too much credit but I do not believe Jihan Wu is short term or stupid. That leaves only one conclusion. They are acting for control reasons not ROI by either PBOC or the banking cartel which is now in such trouble they must run negative interest rates. Bitcoin unleashed i.e. core with segwit and LN would provide a solution the the problem facing world finance.  But the solution being decentralized does not fit their agenda. We are not up against business people we are up against collectivists in positions of hi power in a world that is on very shaky ground. We are in in a deflationary spiral and when it bottoms hyperinflation Venezuela style will hit. Central banking is literally a cancer of man kind. They don't mind keeping bitcoin as long as it can be centrally controlled.

Does the bank have jurisdiction to regulate and charge fees for exchanging fiat for apples and oranges and bananas or anything else for that matter. 
Plus what is returned for the FEE of $2,000 for exchanges? zero nothing .. JUST Permission. Govern Ment is nothing other than mind control yet people simply can not grasp that they live in a slave system since they no longer think for themselves.

yep governments , banks and regulators are crooks. How much evidence do we need. I wish people would wake up. They are all based on force and threats of violence rather than voluntary consent. They just can't allow for peace and free markets because they don't GIVE they are predators.
Even taxation is not an excuse because unless it is voluntary and transparent it is by definition theft.I really don't understand why more people can not see the obvious.  If you ASK then fine IF you FORCE then not fine and it is unlawful.  Yep many ACTS are unconstitutional and unlawful and invasive of our rights but yet still 90% of he population goes along with it. They are really cowards to not call a spade a spade
And the kicker is if the 90% of the public STOPED GOING ALONG WITH IT. then it would end. But the public is so CONDITIONED now that they are the real tyrants.

Specifically consensus via nodes must be decentralized so that monetary policy is in the hands of the nodes and asset holders. Otherwise they will devalue the currency OVER TIME creating inflation and subtle taxation as they do with fiat.  Invisible taxation by currency corruption through monetary supply inflation.  
The current banking system and government use money as a mode of control and a mode of theft by implicit taxation via supply. The temptation will always be to great for centralized power to steal via inflation unless we the owners and node operators run the system as we have no advantage of ruining our holdings.
  
IN addition, there is also censorship risk via centralized coins which ironically makes the centralized coins less fungible and hence NOT EVEN MONEY as by definition money must be fungible.  (hence why i post about privacy and anti kyc etc - which often gets marked as OFF TOPIC.. IRONICALLY)  Fungibility is the 2nd most important part of bitcoin and its not PERFECTLY fungible without anonymous transactions.  
  
Honest actors would have no game theory advantage to have a centralized coin so those that understand these fundamentals  realize the painful truth that CENTRALIZED COINS are in line with a the same Total Global Control grid wet dream of the oppresive oligarchs.  The very debate I often have with Christians is that a casheless society will end up censoring and oppressing people via the money system. This is why Christians and many others demand CASH never be eliminated.   I try to explain to them that bitcoin is not yet easy to censor and ask for their help in fighting oppressive policies of track and trace to avoid this orwellian nightmare scenario.  At the same time I try to get bitcoiners to understand the TRUE fear that Conservatives and Christians have about 'casheless' vis a vis fungibility .. again I CAN NOT post about this here as it often will be marked as off topic.
  
Bitcoin and its interface in society is often overlooked as we have too narrow a view of what bitcoin is and how it relates to our lives.

but not a contributor to the price or value. It ONLY contributes to bitcoin to the extent it can secure and stabilize the network.  But it seems as a handful of giant miners could care less about this. So no they are leeches. In fact many coins don't even need miners.

As an investor I simply look at Supply and Demand.  Inflation rate will be cut in half .. PERIOD end of story. NO pseudo intellectual drivel is needed beyond this.   
\----  
Hash rate could be slashed in half twice  and still provide enough security.  Many people can not get this into their head.. MINERS WORK FOR US NODES!  They are a cost. They provide security via POW but even if the mining system began to fail  we could FORK a different proof algo onto our network. We don't do this because of the concern over sybil attacks which could be mitigated by integrating POS or hybrid system or incentivizing nodes better.

I don't need to follow someone like a CULT to see what they have to say. Make no mistake about it Bitcoin WILL HAVE another giant bull run. Maybe not 20x over ATH like before but you can bet your sweet budats will will reach 6 figures . Fundamentals long term have NEVER been better than now and yes decentralized trading will be the future. Not sure about defi but DEX in general will be the standard.  The world is at odds with each other in every respect. There simply is NO TRUST nor should there be. This is why Bitcoin is better than any other SOV asset. TRUSTLESS MODEL backed by math and 90% consensus.
However short term Banking Oligarchs can definately play games with the FIAT PAIRING.. and this is what I like seeing exposed. because too many times people behave as if 'THE AUTHROTIES' regulators and Bankers are to be respected.  After over 10 years of investigating ths subject I can safely say you can trust nobody in a leadership role. The entire game is rigged which means its not even 'free market capitalism' it is Pretend capitalism and the central control models match up perfectly with the ISM'S communism fascism etc. I want people to realize we are the authorities and do not have to be slaves to CULT of personality and CULT of authority.

Basically have to travel to a big city in most countries to get privacy via meetups etc.. and LBC for now.. but my point is if people don't realize that we DESERVE privacy then the State media (all major media) will demonize us to the 95% who don't even have any coin.  I guess free men have to go underground to trade assets nowadays to get any privacy.  This is a sad state of affairs and even sadder when you consider less than 5000 politicians and bankers are responsible for this destruction of our privacy rights. we outnumber them literaly 1.2Million to 1 yet we have to hide! FFS beam me up scotty.
Also consider States like US blocking finance to entire countries like Iran who (i dont like but has not agressed war for many decades). they literally trying to block SWIFT.. and look at actions on Venezuala..  IN other words.. World leaders feel its 'RIGHT' to cut people and groups off who they don't like politcally. They are authoritarian tyrants and need to be called out by all of us to counter the media propaganda that they control.
Meetups in person are great until they decide we are all terrorists for meeting up to exchange bitcoin and wack us..  Here in asia we got dictators blowing people away who are simply SUSPECTED of smoking grass!  I mean WTF.. U really want to go underground and put all the stress on our tech ability to circumvent? or is it easier to show to the public what these few men are doing under the guise of security to destroy our ability to freely trade or speak.

Guilty until proven innocent? Can you prove he injured a party with his action? Are you suggesting a crime ?  Suspicion alone?  Why do they call it money laundering? Does it go in the washing machine or is the term used because there is no easy phrase that can hide that 'no crime' under common law exists due to 'money laundering' itself and in fact it is the old 'pre crime' suspicious / tom cruise Orwellian nightmare that has become too commonplace among the non thinking slave. 
If you catch somebody in the act of 'injuring' another or you have probable cause to get a warrant and investigate such an injury than please do that but to place the burden on the 'free market' and 'right to contract' is in itself injurious to the entire free market system and is closely allied with a totalitarian communist agenda.   Do not use our money systems or our lifestyles, speech or opinions to convict us of arbitrary non-crime crimes. 
Stop using financial systems in place of old fashion police work and warrants issued upon probable cause. We demand our constitutional  and Magna Carta reminded god given rights.
Ladys and gentlemen I ask you to reverse this trend of invasiveness and reverse principles which we all grew up in (if over 40 years old).  Folks Please its time to demand common law weather you are in England, Australia, Canada or America we are free men sovereign not slaves of a planetary control grid.  Learn and compare the spirit of the founding documents of western nations  and defend those principles. Please stand up with me and others for the princples of 'all men equal under the law'   'right to face your acuser'  'crimes require a body of evidence and an injured party' 'the right to contract freely' etc etc.

snip related --
In the United States, Senate Bill S.1241: “Modernizing AML Laws to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing” is tabled for debate. This is an exceptionally bad, un-American bill, very probably drafted in part by incumbents who fear being disrupted by Bitcoin. This bill has been tabled because anti-Bitcoin agents have been working overtime, spreading the mistaken idea that Bitcoin is money or an asset. It is neither. I will explain exactly why Bitcoin is not an asset or money, and why this absurd bill is unconstitutional and bad for America.
snip .. [
hmmm wow  bitcoin is TEXT? / speech
... check out the link above.
What is the charge for groups that pass unconstitutional bills? Is there a repercussion for this type of treason against the people?  Or will they just say bitcoin is hate speech? hmmm This world is becoming very unfamiliar to me.  Just like certain guns are 'illegal' now certain speech is 'illegal' .. Sounds like they step down or face a revolution. I mean if we are just slaves... then what good is the law?
common law protects us. 'de jure respecting corpus delicti' - made for the people
Admin law enslaves us.   'defacto by consent' - made for the law society

They would be better off  focusing on loans, investment SERVICEs but they don't want that they want to control the world with just a few men from a dark corner.   They are collectivists and communists at their center and is why their system is based on centralizing perpetual 'debt'.

I doubt it. Did you not see the post re comments of CBOE head? They openly now admit that since supply is fixed it is a threat to their monopoly legacy system where a few men control the rates and supply for the entire planet.
For these centralist communists (who are in control disguised as capitalists)  a few dozen of them will continue to rig the exchange rates and money supply to maintain their control of your future. Resistance is futile.

And think about the precedent being set by allowing KYC AML ID be a requirement to do speech?? To access software? Or in the case of money .. to simply make 'transfer rights' to the network.  It's like you are not allowed to MOVE an inch Without being tracked and traced.. And once you give the info away you are at personal security risk if someone gets a hold of that info.. The entire idea of regulating speech and tracking and tracing is nothing more than SLAVERY.
Its not about being a 'libertarian' its about having the right to live your life as a free man vs a slave.  But look at europe where nearly 1/2 of all labor is FORCED (50% tax on average) to be given away to the state..  That is nuts but people accept it as normal.  This is our enemy, not the banks not the evil politicians but THOSE THAT THINK TYRANNY is normal and that we need approval to do business with each other.

This was my point of posting it.   Many well educated people have pointed out that banks have power over nations  and I'd like to see America and the West get their sovereignty back for the younger generation instead of being beholden to central bankers. 
I think you should have let that post go forward its obviously NOT my ytube and even it it were still there is nothing harmful in letting people make up their own minds.    
As far as my comment to you being banker related.. I have no clue who you are but I just couldnt think of another reason why it was Blocked..

Ofcourse they will as they talk about banning it. Bitcoin is the ultimate world reserve currency outside of any one nations control.  There is about 24 Trillion in fiat floating around. My guess is 1% will find its way to bitcoin this year.

Install bitcoind on a linux box or at a datacenter for $25 bucks a month

php can talk to bitcoind via json rpc and spit out a fresh address.
Assign that address to your customer.
Have walletnotify call up another php script which updates your database so you know it is paid and by whom as each customer order has an address.

If you are not joining me in spreading the principles of freedom and liberty get prepared to lose it. Not just on crypto, our right to contract with each other, our right to decide what goes into our bodies, our right to choose our occupations, where we live, what we built on and on.
If you don't go crazy turning this horrible trend of 'rely on big daddy' to author your life then get prepared to slip year after year into abject slavery to 'the corporation' 'the man' however you want to look at it.   If you don't decide to full court press defend the free market system you will not be free.
I had to write this here because crypto aware people have the brains and ability to undestand cause and effect and the ramifications of ignoring how much control of our lives we have lost.  Not just lost but SURRENDERED without so much as a wimper.. Notice as you read article after article how people just acquiesces to centralized control and just assume that everything is illegal if they don't have explicit permission.
The question is do you have the guts to spread words of freedom and humanity to a world that, for the most part, has been brainwashed with leftist propaganda for so long we think this is the way it should be.
The keep turning us against each other and dividing us, because their only excuse  is 'protect you from a criminal'
We see a few cases of criminality and think its rampant when it's just the opposite. Media has poisoned the well and has been completely captured by collectivists at the top.

Please see below those are administrative codes not Common Law they are defacto not dejure and require consent. Please stop spreading propaganda to dismiss our human rights.  If you consent then it is indeed a violation of administrative code.. but it is not unlawful. Tired of people trying to usurp common law with UCC and the like. You must work for the government or a bank and trying to fool us into giving away our rights as enshrined under the magna carta and constitution. "all people are equal before the law." means you can not 'arbitrarily' determine what is criminal and what is not and hence a 'true crime' requires an injured party.

edit as far as the LINK i dont care and don't even know if they are any good my point is We the people / bitcoin owners compete by remote mining.. I'm looking for any solutions that are plug and play remote.

In order for bitcoin to boom we needed this and a few mostly Chinese men (who have not invested in bitcoin but rather a way to suck money out of it) have blocked it. 
A few men acting like children literally will TOP OUT bitcoin price.  This is the problem of centralized power. 
Either core comes out THIS WEEK WITH A PLAN to decentralize the power of mining or I'm out of this crypto sphere an a lot of hodlers will bail as well and THE WINDOW OF OPPTY THAT YOU SEE in headlines all over reddit will be moot. Once network effect is lost everybody looses.

The State does not own you or does the IRS. They are criminal entities, using the threat of force/violence and intimidation to get their way, so you would serve them as their slaves. They are going after people who grow their own gardens, homeschool their kids, gun owners, and  even tea party members. They need to find ways to lock you up in prison, and they also need to find ways to control you and your family. They know how dumbed down and uneducated the public really is, and how much they would give up their money, and their rights as citizens.

By looking at the court case Diversified Metal Products v. IRS and the definition of the IMF from Black’s Law Dictionary 6th Edition, we know that the IRS is NOT part of the United States government and the IMF IS an agency of the United Nations (UN). In other words, these two foreign agencies are unlawfully collecting tax and money from the American people. If you are an American, you should be mad as hell over this! But instead of remaining angry, turn that anger into motivational energy to motivate you to learn how the tax and banking system work.
The IRS, the Fed, the IMF, and the UN are criminal private corporations that are responsible for destroying the economy of the USA and the economy of many other countries throughout the world. Because they are criminal corporations, they have no lawful standing so don’t be afraid of them.
Who control the IRS, the IMF, and the UN?
The IRS, the IMF, and the UN are controlled by the Crown Temple, which is the secret society that controls the Crown of England. The Crown Temple and the Crown of England take orders from the Pope of the Vatican! The Vatican has a strong relation with the Illuminati, but even more so with the Jesuits. These secret societies along with the Nazis, the Zionists, the Skull and Bones, and the Freemasons are known as the New World

They give no reason what so ever for their predictions and I just couldn't help thinking "does anybody understand what bitcoin is?"

This is incorrect. (investor pov)
  Each coin weather BTC or ALT serves a variety of investor goals for exa;
 * speed of execution
 * amount of decentralization (security from attack)
* immutability (amount of flex of ledger)
* store of wealth
* appreciation potential (amoutn of growth ptoential)
Now many of these are INCOMPATIBLE and hence block chains and rules should fill these niches in a variety of ways thus allowing investors to match their funds with their goals and risk aversion levels.
I hold 90% of my assets in Bitcoin because of;
 1. decentralization and stability and hedge
but would surely use monero to mix and other networks for POS level retail transactions etc etc.
Try to be everything to everyone will end up serving nothing to nobody.

yeah before you refer me to r/conspiracy this page has source links just FOLLOW THEM. most are still working. 
he Internal Revenue Service is not an agency of the United States government. It is true that not only can it NOT be found in Title 31, but it is nowhere to be found in the entirety of Title 5 U.S.C. 
Congress THOUGHT it created it but it didn't. Just look at the 1100 manual and it tells you so. Congress only created the Commissioner's Office. He then hired the private collection agency people and used them as the tax collectors. In fact, I defy you to find any IRS employee listed as an Employee of the United States Government with a United States Employee Identification number that has been hired by any District Director in the country. Now I suggest you look at 27 Code of Federal Regulations Section 250.11 and therein you will find the definition of "Revenue agent." That definition reads "Any duly authorized Commonwealth Internal Revenue Agent of the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico." 
SOLUTION: make taxes and everything thing else voluntary. Anything less is literally slavery.

Our governments / banks are Mafia men there is no question about it.  If a bank stopped you from transfering money just a few decades ago there would be an aproar and people would withdraw all their cash. Plus a 'bail in' would cause riots and violence..

I predict what will happen is a Balance will be struck between with a 'Safe Hard Fork' 2mb + segwit. Safe being there will be no risk of minority chain.  This will allow Onchain to compete with Lightning and other 2nd tier payment channels and keep centralization in check from both mining centralization and market (2nd tier) centralization. And Bitcoin will then go mainstream.   Onchain will be slighty more expensive and used for bigger ticket transfers and 2nd tier segwit enabled payment channels will be used for Fast Low risk low ticket transfers. At this point we will see capital inflows in the billions each week. Miners will earn substantial from increased price and extra transactions generated from 2nd tier and Semi centralized institutions will solve the adoption problem.  Look at 500 Billion market cap by 2018.
If no balance is struck by the end of q1 2017 bitcoin will begin to stagnate as altcoins will fill the gap. The market share will never quite recover at this point.

The only reason bitcoin is alive is because of PRICE APPRECIATION! it is acting as gold not as transaction vehicle of the world..  with segwit and LN we can have our cake and eat it too.

People are afraid of everything. As a software developer who has suceeded in making lots of nifty stuff I have always failed because I assumed people would click around (explore) but they are either too lazy or to afraid so you have to handhold them every step of the way.  
Once I made 3 seperate UI's for a webpage and every one got criticized as not easy enough.  So as a case study I held voice conferences with all the critics and what I found shocked me. They will not read anything even without scrolling even things in bold .. even a short menu set.   I gave up and am now growing vegetables with my time.

segwit and LN would effectively reduce the demand for bigger blocks. Eventually even with segwit blocksize will have to be increased eventually but only a fraction of what is needed without it.

You should start caring cause segwit opens up innovation and 2nd layer ability which will allow bitcoin to literally reach the moon and their are individuals blocking this innovation cause they want to protect margin rather than focusing on their revenue as this is the asian way. They make profit by cutting costs and cutting corners not innovation. This is the risk of having giant chinese mining pools controlling the show.

Also I think viaBTC and others are short sighted. The way I see side chains and lightning there would be plenty of room for them to serve those layers as well if they were to be proactive.
But that may be the point.. Who are miners? I think they are just driven by one thing short term greed and profit potential for contributing virtually nothing other than electricity , cpu's and space. 
I will say this like I did months ago which got mixed reviews. There must be a way in code where we can Punish Large scale data centers and reward simple device SINGLE MINING UNITS there-by spreading the mining work to a more altruistic crowd. I know I am not the only guy running a node at my own expense without mining just to chip into the entire system.   From my perspective mining revenue is .0001% the value that bitcoin brings to the ecosystem yet they have all the control.  How can we fix this? Or can my node refuse to validate large pools? How can we punish political agendas from ruining progress?  Let me know guys cause I just don't have the tech knowledge but I don't like seeing bitcoin hijacked by profit motives of LARGE POOLS.
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:45:38
I thought that way too but to be honest pruning and sharding \(another scaling approach\) is not needed.  
Hard drive space is so far above demand I'd rather have the entire thing.

Can segwit raise it beyond the .8mb efficiency increase? As long as we get segwit why not also increase AT LEAST A LITTLE ?? I don't see the risk in COMPROMISE and working together instead of stale mating until obsolescence.  Payment chans LN is very exciting to me but it only makes sense when you terminate on the chain or else its just an sql database far as I can tell.. BOTH!  seems to be the logical answer not either or.. 
Lets get rid of THE CONTENTION;
  core supporters are scared of UNLIMITED size as that can lead to Centralization but most are Not dead set against a small and reasonable increase.
Big blockers are worried about diminishing the on chain value and reducing the TX fee revenue and incentive of miners.  By letting them have some more blockspace it will allow onchain to compete a bit better with LN solutions while also giving miners revenue of termination of ln transactions.  Transactions volume will probably not drop much and will be offset 2x-10x by BTC price explosion IMO.  The miners pie percentage drops 20% but the pie increases 500% its a no brainer.  
Also keep in mind rootstock and the like and other uses for the chain beyond the norm. We for sure will need 2mb onchain and maybe later 4mb  JUST NOT 200MB.
With no more contentions HF is non problematic especially with fore knowledge of mining pools. 
So we get segwit they get what they want we all win.

True especially with layers on top like lightning and side chains. Low risk , low ticket will move to side chains and consolidate to the main chain.

Yes IF the price of a bitcoin market was soft they could create a panic as volume would be larger and lead to other traders on other exchanges panicking but the effect would be short term and highly risky as short squeezes could be painful.  But if the market had some bad news and then naked shorts piled on sure. It happens.
Price suppression can really only happen in the short term. The gold bugs out there complaining of gold price suppression really exaggerate price suppression. They don't want to admit that metals, while a good hedge in inflationary crisis are terrible performers when the economy deflates.

Try this link my brother. 
or this  file.
teaser snippet from the .doc file 
"IRS is contracted to provide collection services for the Agency for International Development, and case law demonstrates that the true principals of interest are the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (Bank of the United States v. Planters Bank of Georgia, 6 L.Ed (Wheat) 244; U.S. v. Burr, 309 U.S. 242; see 22 USCA § 286, et. seq.).
In other words, IRS seemingly provides collection services for undisclosed foreign principals rather than collecting internal revenue for the benefit of constitutional United States government operation"

because they are afraid that 2nd layer protocols will become more popular than on chain and they will lose their % of the pie.. Cause they are mentally retarded in not understanding that LN must terminate on chain and hence will actually increase onchain transactions. They ignore the fact that the price of bitcoin will skyrocket so even if their percentage goes down their revenues would go up.. They have 'WANT IT ALL' mentality  and miners are too short term.  IN the end they will destroy bitcoin and their profits.
they keep talking about blocksize increase but really its a red herring they want to BLOCK INNOVATION OF 2ND LAYER protocol which properly shifts low risk transactions off chain.. See they WANT IT ALL and in the end they will get nothing and take us all down as well.

The maximum bitcoin could be in todays dollar value would be around 3.6Trillion market cap about 1% of the world markets or 1/3rd of Gold Markets.. That puts bitcoin at $190,000 per coin which is around 20cents usd per 'bit' or 1/5th of 1 cent usd per satoshi  For Bitcoin to reach $1M per coin wed need 18+ Trillion in market cap.  It's not realistic unless your looking 20 years out or more.  But $50k by 2021 is quite possible.  and each Bitcoin BIT equivelant to 1 usd cent is very doable even by 2018!  Right now an mBit is almost $1

wrong .. i live and do biz in Asia from the west it is definitely more conniving. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 06:59:46
It's really a good question even though the answer is simple. nothing! as POW works on pure processing work and does not reward IP/location.   In fact the reason we can't get segwit through is the centralization of mining has led to a warp in the importance of mining profit 'margin'. 
I'm sure the people at core are considering a code tweak to disinsensitive centralization.   In theory the current POW model works because miners would never do anything to lower the currency they are being paid in (btc) however that requires a POV beyond 'margin' and onto total profit.  
So the long answer is you can do nothing other than run a node which I do. Nodes are important as well but don't carry consensus weight AFAIK.  Nodes help the network plus you have your own wallet you can interface with for various things via the node.  
Join a pool if you want your souped up computer to mine coins. Even at break even this would help towards hash consensus.

THIS wow yes
"However, it's possible to format the ready\-to\-commit transaction as a transaction that not only closes the existing payment channel but which also opens a new payment channel. In that case, the same security that allows the initial payment channel to have zero\-conf security also extends its security to the second payment channel."   
Ironic i was just suggesting this to r/lightningnetwork
BOTTOM LINE it makes btc scale infinitely WHILE keeping supply constant ofcourse AND keeping security tied to main chain.

Drugs and weapons,
Well the 'drugs' was friggen POT something legal in many states used for medical and health purposes and if used recreational makes people laugh , enjoy music and eat potato chips.BFDWow I'm so thankful they stopped that as well as stopped people from what the constitution reminds you is your right to bear arms. I guess if they had nukes and were molesting babys that would be different (injured party)   but lets not pretend they are defending LAW! They never do break down doors to defend your rights the break em down to take them away.
No they are defending commercial statutes and not common law. They shit all over your law enshrined to protect your rights and replace it with 'you live the way we want and do what we want or we cage you' , resist and die.  This is what I see when I look at a story like this.
Bitcoin, cash or whatever that's really a side bar issue..  Learn the difference between Common Law and administrative statutes and things get a bit clearer.
"The Dark Market"  see how they meme it all out for us? ooo ooo the 'dark market'   'money laundering' hahaha can you guys see through it its smoke and mirrors. Meanwhile things like pizzagate get swept under the rug.
As long as there is no 'injured party' there is no body of evidence and hence no crime. THIS IS LAW! all else is de facto color of law.

The solution is BOTH  we baby step
1. Segwit with 2mb to start SF no drama then WE SEE HOW IT GOES.
The issue is fear of LN but that is where it goes pair shaped because LN is only OPTIONAL payment channels LN needs on chain termination right?  There will be pro's and cons to LN usage but I see LN and on-chain working together not opposing. 
Let's on-chain scale NOW to the limit where it would not effect decentralization (i.e. nodes too big to run easily) 2MB to 4MB max and at same time activate segwit.
What is the risk in SF seqwit +2MB now? would that not satisfy everyone and give us more data points in 2017 to see the effects?

Libertarians (as well as some honest left wingers) also dislike anti-money laundering laws because they substantially undermine privacy.

Thats why they are anti cryto in India.. how else could they hold people's economic lives hostage?   Bankers and Governments are literally THUGS!  Socialists hate competition because they don't know how to serve people but rather rely on FORCE and NO CHOICE to parasitically grow. It's really anti human and its sick but since the Leftist have brainwashed most of the world that's what we have.. BANKS ARE NOT CAPITALISTS! they are central command and control.  Then as we see the damage , you see mind controlled activists blaming 'free market capitalism' totaly denying the fact that THERE IS NO COMPETITION.

Before people start their 'doubting thomas' machine.. consider $10,000 bitcoin with 16 Million coins is a market cap of $160B which is 1/20th of 1% of world markets  about equivalent to the wealthiest top 3 human beings (if you can call them that).
But  keep in mind this.. While we have 16 Million coins in circulation we really only have AT MOST 2-4 Million liquid!
I think the reason why the 'private IRS' wants to declare capital gains as shifting money between shoe boxes is They know what is about to happen and they want their cut!
There is no capital gains until you sell the asset but this is a last ditch effort, along with shutting down the 'Goldman Sucks Bitcoin exchange - circle jerk' to throw water on a fire that is about to mushroom to the clouds.
See they know that for now flight to safety alone is bitcoins key value point and now with the OPTIONS we have its pretty obvious bitcoin can scale eventually.

A few weeks ago but the Things I noticed;
This was on bloomberg which is notorious for slamming bitcoin so their audience is biased against bitcoin at least somewhat.
The interviewer of Novagratz immediately lasered in on the yellow 'bitcoin is of no value' as if they were the majority..  But do you see what they did? how politics is played?
Look carefully because you will notice 1, 2 and 3 are hugely positive with 'only a Minority 37&amp; being negative. But by **splitting the positives** they can point to the max negative which IMO is ridiculous as anybody who has been on r/bitcoin knows. Same tactic is used in political jurisdictions with more than 2 partys.
Point is it shows how subtle the media can portray bitcoin negatively.  For me it seems obvious that media is implicitly colluding at the behest of bigger players.  This smells like accumulation time to me. This is not hard to achieve even without grand conspiracies. It just view shaping from the top down.
Mid term outlook? Somewhere between 3 and 7 months ($5k to 8k chop) is my guess and a $32k by halving in 22 months and 80k or so a year after.
Now I can unpause [ and watch the rest.

What eveyone misses is what bitcoin is.
It's simply the ability to hold a private key that can access the network.  
The only people fighting against this are those who are against 'PRIVATE PROPERTY'
This is indeed the ROOT fundemental between free people and slaves, between a free market society and  a collectivist central tyranny (socialism, communism, fascism)
The issue is not about money nor bitcoin it is simply; are we free to own private property or are we slaves to masters.
There is 1 GROUP of people who invented communism who is presently controlling the financial markets. This group controls well over 85% of all monetary activity in the world and the group is so powerful that we are not allowed to name them nor discuss this.   If we are able to overcome this we will have freedom. If not TOTAL LOCKDOWN!

Of course taxation is theft unless it's voluntary. It's not even a matter of opinion. What statists debate is 'certain theft is good' if the majority wants to steal from the minority.In order for taxation to work voluntarily the programs funded would have to be transparent and open to the public but they prefer to just stick a gun in your face or threaten you with jail if you don't give to them despite not knowing where it is going.
The worse part of this all is that MOST people support this group theft as they have been brainwashed and are hopelessly enslaved.

It's really more like a criminal conspiracy than it is politics.
The intent was to destabilize a financial market which could easily be proven in a class action lawsuit. There are several bitcoin foundations I think it's time we give our support to along these lines.  We don't need institutions creating artificial supplies in their directive markets to also cause us chaos (cme etc)
 We should be prepared to collectively support anti market manipulation and crimes against bitcoiners and the network.  This network and the many holders are targets and maybe it's time we get some pre-emptive defense cause many of the tactics used by this group is technically racketeering.
There are multiple points of attack and we should have multiple points of social defense. Maybe borrow some of the principles of decentralized ledger power and extend it socially.  Ever heard of assassination politics? Very interesting topic if mafia men continue their offensives.

Theft by uphold / holdup 
don't listen to the trolls below.. FACT is unless holdup can proove OP did something unlawful that BTC commodity has been stolen.
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY
or move to north Korea people.
I SEE too many posts about how NORMAL and OK kyc is but it is ON ITS FACE backwards and assumes guilt. Where did you grow up? All western states have the presumption of innocence  but yet so many people here take KYC as the new normal.  You want to know why?
Cause they must admit it to themselves that they are powerless and helpless little girls if they were to admit the truth about 'the presumption of innocence' 
So instead look at all the posts below blaming OP because one thing or another rather than blaming the perpetrator backed by a twisted set of laws based on the false narrative that 'YOU COULD BE A TERRORIST' fk u all pansy ass communists.
And btw NONE of the articles below accurately OUT uphold but rather bitreserve. How about coinapult? i have scoured the internet and can't find dirt on them CAN I USE THEM? or same shit likely to happen?

BCH; few devs , a mining cartel and nodes that will eventually have to run out of data centers do to bandwidth of larger blocks.  focused on taking over bitcoin brand while at most it is good for 'smaller' transactions BCH will be equivalent, ironically to a single LN channel.  the extra security advantage of doing it all on chain is undermined by the fact that bch is 51% attacked already!

Very good question among 100 other things.
Anybody wanting to increase block size BEFORE we see what the small increase of segwit has, is not searching for improvements at all. In other words this is not a debate because they are not 'sincere'. A sincere person would say ok .. well we got a small increase just with reorging the witness data lets see the impact.  That way if big blocks are needed in the future we will have good data so the community will get behind it.
No its not even about scaling. it's about what it always is 'monopoly men and control'
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:10:53
What do you expect they are a criminal mafia. Stop thinking government is good they work for giant corps an central bankers. 
If they keep pushing hard my guess is 'assasination markets' will start proliferating. Scary thought or inevitable. The criminal mafia bank system controls 68% of the entire globe as proven in a swiss study last year. Net neutrality and KYC are their weapons. 
Since they keep proceeding in this direction I see an inevitable head on train collision.  Their train has several thousand people on it. Our train has around 5 million and growing.  
The elite is better off trying to Buy In rather than go against it. But if not I'm sure the decentralized power will fork them off.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:46:21
 Also why they piled onto the rape train of bch pump. It's all about the money for most newbies they could care less about freedom and this is why they can't VALUATE what makes crypto valuable. Cause to most of our sick population individual freedom is not it. They are too conditioned.

The banking system is not CAPITALIST or especially FREE MARKET
a Free Market system does not have barriers to entry and exit that is exclusive domain of CENTRAL CONTROL , wich is both communism and fascism models.  
Just curious why do you think the banking system is capitalist? Because the TV said it was?
How does criminalizing money and private property exchange give us free markets?
No it's a socialist wet dream (all the isms are collectivist and boil down to central control where some individuals tell you what you can and can't do despite no crime being comitted on your part)  In the west our Traditions which are being violated PRESUME your innocence. IN a free society they must have 'probable cause' to initiate any sort of action.  But getting all your data and tracking you matches almost perfectly with both Communism and Fascism.

Simple, supply and demand.. if the network as a whole is only minting 1/2 the coins (reward) it did before the halving event while demand is steady or slightly increasing you will have a shortage.  Takes a few weeks for supply to dry up After the halving for it to impact the market.

Its a way to re hypotheticate bitcoin and dry up demand into fake bitcoin (paper bitcoin) with no proof of keys. It's a mechanism of price suppression which can only be overcome by volume spot purchases which isn't happening at the moment as people in mass don't really care about freedom to the extent of actually doing something positive.

finex is not a bank they rely on banks to back up tether but are constantly on the run as banks are told who they can and can't do business with in the new 'FREE MARKET communist system'  Remember tawain? and WF? those banks were big and as legit as a bank can get and they were told to sever ties so that the people could not have their stable coin outside the control of the cartel.  Banks are not open competition but more like the middle east oil cartels. In fact they lean on the oil industry to back their inflated notes which is also becoming an issue.

Good stuff however I'm not sure an archy is focused on 'norms' but rather 'free will' and the non aggression principle.
The non-aggression principle (NAP), also called the non-aggression axiom, the anti-coercion, zero aggression principle, or non-initiation of force, is an ethical stance asserting that aggression is inherently wrong. In this context, aggression is defined as initiating or threatening any forceful interference with an individual or their property.\[1\] In contrast to pacifism, it does not forbid forceful defense.

Cash settled crypto is a fraud on it's face and the intent is to CONTROL it via this inflationary mechanism.  Anybody who thinks wall street will be good for crypto has to get their head out of their asses.  They suppressed price discovery of gold using this mechanism and they plan on CRUSHING YOU as well.  That's how they roll and the entire banking system has very little to do with free market and helping the populous and much more with shifting control to central bankers to create boom and bust cycles.  Ironically when you research it deeply you will find The banking system is not really 'free market capitalist' but way closer to a centralized communist structure.   I wish it were different and that people in high finance were there to provide free market liquidity and equal opportunity to investors in fair markets.

@_date: 2019-04-28 16:33:48
My point is here that **consensus trumps all other properties of bitcoin.**  
If we agree not to be fleeced by clandestinely stolen coins by those that want to take down or suppress our entire network?  My hunch is that Garzik was right when he said DK was satoshi and it lines up with the lawsuit of DK's family for 1 million or so coins. Why would they sue someone for those coins unless they knew he had them?  
**Game theory suggests we as the network should insure the lowest risk** of systemic subterfuge as possible.   We have the coding ability to **insure against this risk to the benefit of the entire network** as long as it is done before the risk is realized.  Once realized (coins moved) we could no longer fix this without repercussions. 
Most people I talk to about this in this space feel we should grin and bare it and suffer the massive inflation wave (expected coins in circulation vs actual) but my fear is that it will break the momentum and set us back up to 1 to 2 halving cycles before we absorb the blow.  
Everyone looks at the opportunity of bitcoin to positively effect markets but what few look at is RISK.. It is risk that allows us to trade at 5,000 instead of 50,000.  Lower the risks and you change the net present valuations.

A. i wont even respond to.
B. Who says you can't fund public servants via voluntary funds, insurance and usage fees?  I will tell you who.. MEDIA AND PROPAGANDA.
They have us all convinced that we the people are rotten violent and ungiving.. but this is a lie.  It is those who MANDATE theft that are rotten , taking and violent.  As far as personal security / cops. it's better if we , the public were resposible for that and not reliant upon cops who show up AFTER the fact 99% of the time.
Oh by the way.. i already have contributed to volunteer fire departments before. IN fact if the communist bureaucrats stop stealing we'd have plenty left over to give to public servants, and it would actually give us pleasure to help instead of paying just to stay out of jail.  Plus think about how accountability of public servants would be in line with funding.

There is nothing wrong with bitcoin it's the masses who don't want to have a better system that they control. They want big daddy to control their lives. The price is a reflection of the people's demand for a fair and sound money system.. It's at $5500 as this is around the base of true believers.. It got to $20k before simply because of greed and emotions not because of fundamentals.. The volatile shows you how emotional people are not the flaw of bitcoin but of our cultures.
My advise to you is don't invest because if you can't see WHY A censorless  system with defined inflation is better than fake fiat you never will get it.
In fact we don't need people like you looking to invest to make fiat profit.  This is for people who buy and hold until they can spend it. Slowly more and more people are accepting Bitcoin.

Give me free market or give me death..  Good thing there are free nations still out there that don't rob you.
I mean honestly if YOU don't have the right to steal people's money obviously then why do you have the right to have a GROUP Do it? Why? I hope all you that go along with this 'taxation is good' idea go to hell. I mean really you are promoting slavery because that is what organized theft is and those that promote and accept slavery and oppression because somehow 'the ends justifies the means' deserve hell.

Gents;  Very good panel of Mostly Maximalists cover the freak show  double fork hash war. This is great material as well as entertaining.  If you can wrap your head around it (not an easy thing to do) you will come away feeling glad you're on the main crypto coin.  You feel more confident after listening to the different aspects and maybe you can send the link on to others. Not so much for the freak show of it (which is fun) but to see how BTC is differentiated as well as what risks we will want to mitigate moving forward.
Forget about price.. HODL and get into the field... We all have a role to play and its not just talking about price. Price simply is a function of..  Potential / Risk
If you can add potential great but you sure can reduce the perceived risk by educating others.  IN order to do that we got to strain our brains a bit.  Or just share the link to vids like this.  Vortex also has youtube channel that is 95% education and done in an inspiring way.  youtube 'btc max' chans cryptocast network and world crypto network are pretty good.
Enoy :) and HOLDL and share

not 1 comment here yet..
The reason bitcoin fell is because humanity is losing freedom world wide. Just look at world events.
Bitcoin is a barometer / index of freedom.. And frakly, we just are loosing on every front and nobody wants to admit it.  Communism is gaining strength thanks to the brainwashing media and a disease calle d apathy.   Bitcoin is NOT compatible with this mindset.:
edit: communism = fascism = leftism
all that is what i mean and it all = collectivism
The fact that I can't even get into specifics right here and now is already telling.. I just can't reach you as even within our community we are limited as to what we can talk about. Bitcoin markets do not work in a vacuum. I can give you very logical proof of this Leftist mentality and how leftism (collective over individual) is destroying free markets but even though I can show how it DETERMINES bitcoin markets and its success It would be considered OFF TOPIC.. That's the thing, it's Not overt censorship it's that we are simply thinking too narrowly.

**The banking system and their puppet governments are a MAFIA**
and declare anybody with wealth a target!  You must jump through hoops and proove your innocents before being ALLOWED to transact with any kind of money.   I've been seeing this communist style tyranny creeping for decades. The frogs are almost boiled now.
Without thousands of people literally going postal and fighting back with extreme prejudice  they will continue to walk all over anyone they feel like.
But I have no sympathy for the OP because he still beleives in THEIR FIAT system so much  that he's more afraid of the bitcoin price falling. LOL He was never a bitcoiner but just wanted to make fiat profit.
Funny though these are some of the reasons I never cashed any of my btc out when it hit 19,000.   I knew it would severely correct but it's actually smarter just to hodl for a few years than to try to get smart and pretend we actually live in a free market when we live in extreme tyranny  supported by billions of apathetic sheep.

That's naive.  If the guy INJURED someone he'd be in jail but it's probably because he hasn't paid the mob it's money. When will people stop being so naive.
@_date: 2019-01-19 00:25:47
That's not entirely accurate.  Because you are forgetting about profit margin / retained earnings which do not require fiat conversion and would have served merchants well year to year keeping profits in btc. Plus SOME of my suppliers DO accept bitcoin.

Because government is a mafia and **wherever they can steal your money they will** because a majority of the population THINKS government is good and freedom bad and dangerous.
If taxation and government were legit it would be voluntary and not force.  People can't seem to get this because they think there is justification to threaten and use violence 'under the right circumstances'. Just like a mafia they simply pick and choose their targets depending on who the mob boss says to go after.

Sure dvote away but how many times have you heard the miners speak about thier huge investment as if it is helping us. All your investment does is increase difficulty it doesn't help anybody as we have reached diminishing returns on the security that the extra hash gives bitcoin. You know who helps bitcoin the most?
1. the core devs   2. the hodlers  3. merchants
There are plenty of coins working just fine without mining at all. One could argue that that is not the 'optimum' level of security but it does show that the benefits of mining POW have a diminishing return and are subject to centralized attacks. 
Switch your mining to segwit away from s2x and we will not be forced into a corner, but I prefer you force us into the corner because I'm not interested in being held hostage ANY LONGER by hardware monopolies and mining cartels as they blow smoke up our behinds of how valuable they are to me.
That scenario is exactly what governments and large corporations have been doing to us since the beginning of time.

If you can not contract freely with one another (buy/sell/trade/barter) , then by definition you are a slave. I don't see anything wrong with defending ourselves from overt slavery even by force if needed.
I wish for peaceful outcomes but at some point this oppression must end or humanity is doomed. I can see a point down the road where people just lose it and attack the political power centers openly. The amount of hubris in government (not just china) is off the charts.

--------------------- this from r/btc but it all checks out --------
DCG (Digital Currency Group) is the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement. The CEO of DCG is Barry Silbert, a former investment banker, and Mastercard is an investor in DCG.
Let's have a look at the people that control DCG:
Three board members are listed, and one Board "Advisor." Three of the four Members/advisors are particularly interesting:
Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018. Yes, you read that correctly, currently sitting board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Barry Silbert: CEO of DCG (Digital Currency Group, funded by Mastercard) who is also an Ex investment Banker at (Houlihan Lokey)
And then there's the "Board Advisor,"
Lawrence H. Summers:
"Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act."

If they don't trade against BTC then it will end up becoming worthless just like their paper fiat.  It's not about blockchain or crypto. In the end it's about how decentralized is it and what is the consensus inflation rules.

9 out of 10 statements in that video link posted was Quoted BY the group in question. So I'm a racist for passing on Quotation from they themselves?
Did you even watch it cause what you have posted proove you are programmed and suffer from cognitive dissonance.  If I had originated the quotes stated in the video we could 'consider' your statement that I am a racist or a hater or a biggot but that's not the case as the quotes are from them and the non quotes are simply matter of records.
What you have done prove we are in serious shape if we value our freedom as we can not discuss these issues honestly instead resort to the pre-programmed labels to avoid a critical discussion. This is why things are not chaning for the better and why Bitcoin may not survive.  We can not expect that crypto with it's destabilizing power shift will surive without our social support and the support of truth.

s2x is 
DCG (Digital Currency Group) is the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement. The CEO of DCG is Barry Silbert, a former investment banker, and Mastercard is an investor in DCG.
Let's have a look at the people that control DCG:
Three board members are listed, and one Board "Advisor." Three of the four Members/advisors are particularly interesting:
Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018. Yes, you read that correctly, currently sitting board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Barry Silbert: CEO of DCG (Digital Currency Group, funded by Mastercard) who is also an Ex investment Banker at (Houlihan Lokey)
And then there's the "Board Advisor,"
Lawrence H. Summers:
"Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act."

Then you have a crowd that says 'governments have tanks and guns and will make it illegal if it upsets their monopoly' 
Keep in mind 'illegal' is synonomous with they will point guns at you.
They just admit that governments are a mafia that terrorize to get their way.
What if they made water illegal what would you do?  
Would you say 'oh well i guess i will stop using water?' 
Or would you pick up your own weapon, clubs, bats knives and guns and fight the politicians that are openly enslaving you?
You have the right to private property and don't let anybody else threaten you or scare you out of that basic right.

Keep in mind Mining is not very decentralized and the decision to signal 2x or not is even less decentralized so when you say a majority of miners it's really not true its a handful of GROUPS!
Nodes overwhelmingly support core and are not yet ready to increase blocksize because it will decentralized nodes and take a way the last bit of power the users have. Increase blocksize is very bandwidth intensive and until technology makes bandwidth a lot cheaper many 'individual' nodes will drop off the network leaving centralized nodes. At this point centralized mining and centralized nodes and you might as well call it paypal. It's not bitcoin or crypto for that matter. 
So anybody that is pushing this could care less about YOU! or your POWER in this entire system they want giant corporations, hardware specialists and datacenter to control the protocol and even who develops for the protocol known as bitcoin.  
The no2xers are trying to protect YOU as an individual user and your ability to run your own node and verify transaction yourself thereby keeping bitcoin decentralized and in the hands of the ordinary people.

Because this world is shit people literally do not care about the number one fundamental of crypto which is decentralization.. they are just in it for the quick buck, Try running a node for bcash at home with 8mb blocks.. Hope you don't mind using up 110% of your bandwidth and buying giant hard drives. Of course nobody will run nodes so it will be shipped to datacenters and then both mining and nodes will be under central control.. Basically paypal only slower!
I really hate this world.. freedom is dead not because of the oppressors but because the population is simply to messed up to  fight for their freedom. One by one all your rights will be stripped.

step 1. clone your electrum wallet ( i will do on 2 diff computers)
step 2 make 2 new addresses
step 3  switch one electrum to btc1 server and other to core server in networks.
Prepare send coins to from electrum 1 to new address 1 but don't click send
Prepare send coins from electrum 2 to new address 2 .. click send
immediately click send on electrum 1
Wait a while and observe both addresses. 
if it fails move winning address back into both electrums and try again.

Fiat equivalent of my crypto portfolio has gone up but my total btc has gone down as my 6% in alts has all crashed so I'm actually a bit sad.. For me the only number i worry about is how many btc i have. I only invest in alts that offer a niche like bitshares and I'm discouraged that so few people are looking at what that can do and how it can help decentralize Trade. It's like everyone knows decentralization is the heart of valuation yet people don't seem to want to support decentralization that much.

What is ignored is MARKET CAP SIZE
Gold 8 Trillion BTC 180 Billion
What this means ANY FLIGHT TO BTC will move price up in a big way!
i.e. 1% of gold sliding into btc would double or more BTC price. This will cause a runaway effect as other assets pour into the small cap bitcoin.
If Bitcoin were already at maturity Market Cap wise then that is a different story but for now? Only one direction is likely and that is up.

Notice that they speak of 'BATTLE' when we speak of 'BUILDING' I have tried to warn this community about the nature of Chinese thinking for a long time but it was not politically correct and dismissed as conspiracy theory. I wish people like Jimmy S would explain to people about the predatory nature of 'the businessmen' in the orient. They don't look at increasing the size of the pie as much as dominating the percentage.  It's not a 'race' issue I think it's an issue of growing up in a authoritarian regime that gets people to view success as how you exploit the system at hand.

The article says just the opposite of your headline. Americans 'the majority' are sheep and won't get in till very late as they are still stuck on worshiping 'authority' i.e. fiat etc.  I moved away from America  a decade ago when I noticed how stagnant and risk averse people had become.  It's not the same country I grew up in. You can even see it in the obesity rates and the obsession on debating politics of the state, the police state on and on. Once a great people , brave and creative, strong and free, now a blob of fat state worshiping sports fanatics who don't even care what the founding fathers had to say.  America is gone and when the debt bubble bursts it will be an afterthought. Ironically bitcoin COULD save america to some extent and mitigate the huge debt problem but they are too brainwashed by bloomberg to get it.

Have you seen the chart that was posted here few weeks back re blocksize and resources needed to run a node? anything over 4mb is a DEFINITE show stopper for many nodes as many as 50%!  If bandwidth gets better etc then we can think about it but right now resource usage is outpacing tech capacity growth. Some people think even 1mb is more than current tech allows. I think 1mb is ok but do not try to convince people that 4mb will not impact decentralization vis a vis nodes.

Core can't compromise cause its not simply 2x! the name is 2x but block weight could theoretically go to nearly 8mb! now that is the issue. but yeah maybe they could have done 1.5x. I would like to have seen some compromise that is still safe for small node operators. 1.5x is doable

Static ownership picture inequity is not nearly as important as SYSTEMIC inequity of earning abilities.  While the rich can jump on, over time things will equalize whereas right now it just keeps getting worse with income inequality.  (We don't have a free market is the reason we have some huge discrepancy  in wealth) But because we 'pretend to' the free market gets the blame.. I hope people can pick up on this fact soon.
Bitcoin is asking for a transition from centralist (communist, social , fascist all collectivist) control to a POPULOUS control.  As price rises things will even out.  Also keep in mind wealth distribution imbalances has a lot to do with false assumptions like assuming custodial exchange funds are 1 individual instead of cold storage for the group.

FURTHER MORE, it does not even matter if it is centralized!
Centralization is only an issue VIS A VIS 'CONSENSUS'! LN has no concensus it is already subject to the main chain.
Ironically the entire rub against bcash is 'MAIN CHAIN NODE' centralization' which IS the Primary key vis a vis consensus (immutability fungibility etc).  Even more important than miners as bip 148ers showed us.
Bcashers need to GROW UP instead of playing childish mind games.

Plus if you add liquidity i.e. make offers in these markets you will profit a little bit. Sure it's harder to yolo trade and 20x your way into a gazillion in 20 minutes but you will gain by making the market and it's a lot of fun.
Oh and one last thing with something like bitshares hodlers can participate as it is 1000000 x less risky than a centralized exchange.  I, as a trader am always hesitant to keep more than 5% of assets on exchanges, but I feel a lot more comfortable on DEX.

The point about robbing gold vs bitcoin made zero sense to me and was his weakest rebuttal.
1. If perp knew you had gold he could even easier put gun to your head as the gold is right there. $500k of gold is only 25 pounds.If the perp knows you have bitcoin he does not know if its multi sig secured or what making bitcoin safer.  With a multi sig system you could easily prove you do not have all the keys.
2. you could have a alarm system that spends ahead of thief or rbf's it too.

Capital flows work like this and 1% is not what bitcoin will end up with but probably closer to 5% to 10% or currencies and 2-4% of capital markets I was just being conservative. I've been analyzing markets since '85 and came from financial industry.   You are talking of some psychological glitch which even if true is totally irrelevant to what I'm speaking of.. Markets work on capital flows and deal with the changing risk landscape.  And right now the risk of increased rates is 99% as the banks are out of ammo and have stated they will begin selling / deleveraging q1/q2 2018.

Interesting, but to clarify, Volume is definitely correlated but 'turnover' doesn't 'cause' market cap to rise.  
The real volume we need is adoption.  Yes bitcoin is a store of value but adoption would add a nice base and liquidity. Merchant LN and trustless escrows would accomplish that.

This is why I am anti KYC AML cause the question is not whether we are unlawful (causing injury to an individual) but whether those in charge of the personal info are unlawful.
After 10 years of studying this, it is clear. More than 90&amp; of government activity in the world acts unlawfully causing injury to individuals under the guise of admin law (the legal arm of politics).  Government is used to coerce us and it's time we admit we are current slaves of a feudal system.
And what is this deal with everybody going along with 'the right of the state to invade your privacy without warrant issued upon probable cause' ?????
This was an important Principle reiterated in the US 4th amendment and the English Magna Carta .I'm not the tin foil hatter because I believe principles that founded America.

Now I feel guilty i should not have been so harsh.. I thought he was trolling maybe just confused..   
Anyway the prev poster was suggesting that if bitcoin became a reserve currency or a replacement currency it would become a fiat and also lose its anonymity.  
Fiat means 'by decree' so bitcoin is as far from that as we can get. This is not bcash!  
Anonymity is a legit concern but whether or not bitcoin is the base doesn't change that.
  
But yeah we need to fight and support efforts to further anonymize bitcoin. Not because we have some nefarious transactions but because it must be censorship resistant. i.e. NO POLITICS in our money.  NO Law enforcement and NO politics should 'use our ownership' as a weapon against us.  KYC AML and all that stuff that is not productive. If they want to solve crimes do it the old fashion way (after a crime is committed not before!)  don't invade peoples privacy via blanket policies and pretend we have to proove ourselves innocent.   We can definitely make bitcoin fungible via tech but we as a community also have to educate others on the value of freedom, common law vs admin law and not make freedom an underground activity.   
Godspeed.

Why because there investment horizon was 6 months? Who in the FK ever reccomended going into crypto investments with that short of a horizon or going it it for fiat gains. No people are greedy and selfish if they just want to jump on our backs for a quick fiat profit. They don't help bitcoin or develop anything or lift a finger to get it accepted as merchants. Frankly I'm glad those types lost money.     
Want to invest in bitcoin then do it long term and not for fiat profit but to acquire and spend it in years to come on those that accept it and want to be part of this asset class.

1. it's a deminishing increase as rewards are 1/2'd each cycle.
2.  Bitcoin network is probably OVER SECURE by 50x which means POW could be changed into a hyrbid system requiring less electricity.
for instance we have like 32 character keys which can't be cracked with millions of years computer time but we could have 100 character keys which wouldnt be cracked in trillions of years BUT SO WHAT?  It's overkill!  Energy consumption plus hardware costs = security HOWEVER we simply have TOO MUCH of it to protect 200 billion dollar market. I  think we can change pow 'in the future' if need be to get the right balance.

ILLEGAL is not equal to UNLAWFUL
unlawful requires a victim / injured party to yield a corpus delicti 'a body of the crime'
In many cases the enforcement of 'illegal' (defacto laws / statutes) result in an actual crime (injured party) If we can support de-jure law of the land and reject oligarchical administrative statutes without consent of the governed we will have freedom. If not we ill have slavery.

Think CAPITAL FLOWS.. bitcoin will definitely be a flight to safety. 
It theoretically will do better during inflationary crisis like gold does but ironically it will do just as good during deflationary market FOR NOW since the market cap is only 100B NOT 8T LIKE gold.. so it will be the perfect flight to safety (SOV) vehicle until its market cap reaches $4T or higher.  When it matures it will be best in inflationary times not deflationary.

Not only is it being manipulated it's being manipulated or 'EFFECTED' by the same FORCE that effected major equity markets.
Big banker trading desks are causing both. Traders are being taxed.Long term very bullish, short term unpredictable. Ironically its fiat's unlimited supply ability that allows this to happen.

yes loss of bitcoin is inherent to the current rule set however if it EVER made sense to &gt;90% of miners and nodes then it would be a 5 minute adjustment code wise.  i.e. It all boils down to CONSENSUS and if something is TRULY an issue then it will gain 90% consensus which is what you would need PRACTICALLY to fork the circulation / reward / etc.

bt2 will end up HIGHER than btc/bt1 on finex as banks will pump it this is not about mining it is a banker takeover .. just research dcg group they are world bank and ny fed reserve.. 
You people just keep ignoring who your enemy is .. wake up 
You're so gullible most probably believe the main stream story about the vegas attacks as well.  Classic Yuri Benzmenovian takeover has occured 1. Demoralization, 2. Destabilization, 3. Insurgency, 4 .Normalization
Whether you like it or not bitcoin is anti centralist (anti communist anti bolshevic anti new world order) as it sits as we all have decentralized VALIDATION power with our nodes and a wide group of devs.  This is exactly what is being attacked by burdening bandwidth primarily to drive nodes into data centers with the benefit of taking control away from the over 80 developers representing this decentralization.
It's not theory its pure fact just research DCG group and learn what is happening. 
If they are willing to kill people in mass (vegas multiple shooters confirmed) what extremes will they go to to protect their MONOPOLY of power on banking. I am an anarchist however I think we all need to get what is left of the conservative free market power (alt - right) to adopt bitcoin or the extreme leftist deep state communist system will become permanent.
So I'm saying practically we need 'government / political / lawful' power to eventually stop the psychopathic zio communists in power from putting earth into 'lock down' which they are attempting.  It pains me deeply to say this but anarchists like myself are powerless against this satanic force we face.

In actuality what really holds bitcoin back is most people live in denial that the current debt based money systems are systems of slavery. The public simply does not have the ambition to learn any truths let alone financial truths. Sure you have the 2%ers out there but at the heart of the issue is people are brainwashed and branded by corporate media and fashion trends.  Money is debt and bitcoin are assets but to the slaves it means nothing.  
Honestly guys how many people that you talk to about bitcoin venture out and actually get and use it? For me its around 1 in 50.  If humanity demands freedom it will change but I don't see this happening until we reach mad max hyper Orwellian scenarios.

If this trade war keeps up and there is a sovereign debt crisis? Those societies who had a safety net (gold and btc) will have an infrastructure to rebuild a non debt based system.China won't other than a few government elites and some old time hodl whales.
Plus when the Chinese middle class figure out that they were stopped from protecting themselves against this systemic risk? Jinping and his ilk will be running for the hills.
My guess is much of the legacy financial system will start acquiring btc in the next few months to hedge and hold on to their power and perhaps some metals when growth turns into recession.  Rising interest rates will pour an ice bucket over the global economy.  The dollar won't sink (inflation) until panic interest rate 'reduction' is enacted to try to shock the economy alive.   At this turning point metals will take off. While both metals and crypto do well when opposed to inflationary environment BTC having a small market cap will lead gold perhaps by 4 to 7 months is my guess judging history.
The sheep and nocoiner haters living in denial of the coming debt crisis at least they will be able to trade their services and time for btc and we can still get on with our lives in shorter time than having no fallback.  It's why I'm getting into writing apps for merchants LN etc.. In the end we will just be trading btc for goods.
Time frame:  Fall 2018-q1 2019 (severe deflation)
2019: q3 to q4 ( inflation to near hyper inflation )
Caveats:  Trade war is cooled down and interest rates only bump up slowly. (that would push this down the road until 2020)

Total bond market however is WAY bigger than 10T!  like 10X that.
With interest rates expected to rise there is no place to go but 'currency'
Choose between dollars and bitcoin.  Dollars will hold value for a while but with the debt out of control, my money is on bitcoin long term (2-3 years) To fix the debt they got to increase supply and cheapen the dollar.  If bitcoin's market cap were 7 to 8 trillion it would simply hedge against dollar depreciation but with a cap at 125B I'd expect more exponential inflation adjusted returns.
Let's not forget about the stock market which is the current parking lot for 'flight to safety'.
I'm looking at 40% correction by 2021 in the stock market and a start of a bear market later this year to q1 next year.

OR did it? I just saw another Reddit poster insinuating that it is a ploy by WU. This could be but it doesn't make sense as to why.
Also it is mentioned that nodes don't count. I don't think this is exactly true. If major exchanges and wallets see anything over 25% support they are really kinda obligated to support it or risk (moral hazard). 
On a broader note bip148 is a bug fix and allows 80% more capacity per the block and allows other players to plug into the blockchain. All those are very positive for the VALUE of bitcoin. 
Those opposed clearly have agendas beyond what is good for the users and should be boycotted.  In this day of social media a boycott like this would be extremely easy and turn profitable companies (like bitpay now owned by bitmain?) into the red.

Maybe a bit more as bitcoin is not entirely liquid. $22k-$24k would be fundamental base on coin supply and capital but 60% of coins are simply not available for purchase so you could see prices more likely $35k.  But I think we are headed for 1% to 2% of total world capital (365T usd) 2023 to 2025 that's around $191k baseline.

Same old crap memes of how everything will go lightning. This is crap.
Firstly only smaller transactions will go to lightning as lightning carrys risk (small but still risk) Secondly the main chain fees will drop to reasonable levels eliminating 90% of use case need to go lightning. 
The main chain will indeed loose coffee shop transactions. (Oh i forgot they don't even have those)
The price of bitcoin should 5x to 8x quite quickly. Not sure if that is an interest to anybody, but last i checked miners get paid in btc?

Governments that try to Ban or Regulate bitcoin and crypto will in fact be shooting themselves in the foot vis a vis economic progress of their citizens. By the time they realize their mistake their citizens will have to pay 20 times the amount to get in the game. Basically these bureaucrats have no idea what they are doing and are shooting themselves in the foot. 
Just like countries who were lagged on internet infrastructure. They are still playing catch up economically.  
Forget even banning.. just discouraging people from buying crypto is enough to do permanent damage. These people however are so hungry for total control that they can't see the forest in front of the trees.

HERE WE GO AGAIN.. no VICTIM NO CRIME.. when will people understand responsibility and freedom to contract.
It seems harmless to allow regulators to fine companies as they are 'protecting consumers' but unfortunately in the end its just more tyranny. When a consumer gets burned they have the right to sue as there is then an injured party.  But all these sorts of regulation no matter how well intended is simply another form of tryany and control by institutions who they themselves have FAILED over and over again. We must tell them that we are adults and have the right to CONTRACT freely as we choose and to take risks where we deem appropriate or else we are simply 'children' and the State is 'big daddy'. 
Do we really want to be treated like children? 
The company should disclose whatever procedures they have in place including reserves etc.. and the customer should then decide weather it is within their risk limits. It is not the job of government to get in the way of business unless Japan is Communist.

Actually if he were to sell slowly over 1 year bitcoin could easily absorb the 1 million coins without a sweat as that is around 6-7% price drop in total. If he slammed the market with 1 million it would cause panic and the price would plumet at least for a while. 
Another way to look at it is it would set the benefit of reward halving back 16 months or so.  The key to bitcoin price amazingly is not SUPPLY but rather demand. Ironically everyone wants bitcoin to do it all for them but if we only got more involved in hand holding new people into the system Satoshi's 1 million coins would be gobbled up in a few weeks!  But I wouldn't worry .. this creep is not sotoshi an it is likely those first million coins will never spend!  Satoshi would not GAME people like  he did and he'd simply send $5 of coin from one of his addresses. So it aint him it is just the bankers proxy trying to crush the free world yet again.  Theyd be smarter to start buying but who ever said they were smart.
@_date: 2016-05-18 11:09:17
Halving adds a FUNDAMENTAL buy pressure of a few dollars a month to the price but demand is also increasing so that will have much greater affect.

You keep saying 'if they were my coins' as if ANYBODY ON THE PLANET ACCEPT for satoshi  would fit this scenario? 
Maybe satoshi is CIA and you work for them and want to protect the potential $1Trillion dollar coins to later use it to tank the btc market?
My concern is Satoshi is dead but bad people are trying to get the keys and this is what this Craigh Wright Fiascal is all about .. The theft of the keys from Ira!! 
Don't talk to me about bitcoin 101 cause the basis of it is decentralized control and that doesn't happen with 7% ownership in 1 HAND weather its mining or asset ownership.
Maybe you don't give a shit about the constant FUD tanking prices and scaring new entries but I do!  I am the one who wants free market not you.

In fact it would be more secure as it's not subject to the shenanigans we are going through now.

They say it can't scale.. But with lightning it scales fine and the 'build on top' model is way more stable than 'all things to all people' model but they are too short sighted to see this.  Bitcoin is much like an OS rather than trying to be a peice of client software that does it all and this is much safer approach as the '1 coin does all' ignores the tradeoffs inherent in that.  It's much like Bitcon is like Linux and Ether is Apple. IMO

BALLS DEEP NOW! cause you won't have time to buy back in when 148 chain starts skyrocketing unless you find an exchange that will carry both chains. i.e. if s2x fails and an exchange is not 148'd then when you convert from fiat into btc it could be on the chain that is going down! That is why exchanges are criminally negligent for not simply providing multiple wallets/nodes RIGHT THE FK NOW! After all they are 'exchanges' so why the heck would they DICK tate to the market the choices available? I'm so friggen mad all exchanges right now should have A 148 NODE AND legacy node and Futures tokens and trading ready.. No they are going to wait until the very last minute and then scramble to cya

Their attitude is different they are the LORDS of bticoin according to them.. and their hubris will eventually Force a pow change. just watch.
They could care less about users even though its users that give bitcoin value. It's severe greed IMO to the extent of being self sabotaging. If I were a miner I wouldn't be pushing users 'into a corner' but that is exactly what they have done. In the end what will happen is 1 UAHF pow change which will have dynamic pow algors via future soft forks thereby removing asics out of the market (high setup costs will be too risky) and decentralizing mining once and for all.

148ers hold the line.. If they pull the trigger and attack we 'already have a solution on github' that will even the mining playing field within several days!  I propose devs to go one step further and make it Easier to do 'future pow changes via soft fork'. Any time 'hardware' over centralizes hash we upgrade. The interesting part is we only need to do that once at most twice and the entire asic business model falls apart as setup costs become 'high risk'. 
Current asic miners should be dead opposed to attacking the 'user chain' as when you back the users/owners into a corner it's easy to get a remedy as we will have 'no choice'.  This remedy will change the mining model (to a more decentralized model)  
Bitcoin could dip for up to a week while people panic as they do not know what I have just written above but once an attack actually happens Core will also have no resistance anymore to MERGEing this pow change (difficulty immediately reset btw) giving us the final product 'by late August' of;
 core backed / asic semi resistant pow (gpu mined) / segwit capable bitcoin.  
LN and more importantly side chains will allow first round of scaling with a decentralized bitcoin both for nodes and miners. In fact most nodes can switch mining on (inefficient but doable.. yes a node can indeed mine they just don't cause they could not compete) At any rate you will all be able to mine with a GPU and if we make pow tweaks via soft forks (if that is possible) ASIC will have a much shorter life span. 
Beyond this we can then work on on chain scaling that makes sense and does not jeopardize node and mining decentralization. 
Sell your ASIC's now if you plan on attacking you might as well burn your box!

Rather than paper wallets and trezor to keep your bitcoin on the 'down low' try this out. Please verify it works first for you as this is in beta mode.

They did that and its problem solved for all!
If segwit doesn't provide enough relief to scaling we can then talk about block size increases later like adults.
But they don't want to see the effect and look at it rationally they want to Ram it through and all its going to do is kill the goose.
To pretend that a mining cartel can ram through 4MB or 8Mb blocks is nothing short of subterfuge is aiding and abetting centralization of both mining and nodes.

Chinese not putting up a stink over the stopping of withdrawal of ASSETS owned in some cases by foreigners i.e. bitvc.com (hong kong) not just mainland prooves that China is a slave colony with stockholm syndrome having almost no understanding of the importance of freedom.
It's one thing if an exchange gets hacked like finex and entirely another thing when government blocks ALL WITHDRAWAL of assets for months!
What is even more disturbing is the lack of outrage among bitcoiners both in China and outside. 
This world is nothing more than a plantation of cattle and sheep and I fear not even crypto can save us any more. Tyranny is simply way too accepted. It is the new normal now.

Downvote all you want, but the 4 month blockage and possible permanent theft as reported by posters in  bitcointalk and reddit bitcoinMarkets would be equivalent to some of the largest bank heists in history but since it is Government (your mommy for the left and daddy for the right)  you downvote me instead of them. Which is exactly my point of what you have become. 
50 years ago if this happened, even in China there would be hell to pay. Today its HO HUM good thing it's not me and blame the victim. 
I am a huge supporter of crypto but am not naive enough to think math alone can save us. Grow a set and speak out against tyranny or be prepared to have your toilet paper regulated.

Do it yourself.
1. Setup a Node on Linux Server ($30/mo) can do
2. Write a PHP script that queries a trusted api from an exchange to get price.
3. Upon Invoice generation.
A. Get Price of BTC and convert amt of invoice
B. Generate an incoming address via jsonRPC call to your node via PHP (i use easybitcoin library) 
C. Gererate a QR code scan from the address returned in 3b.
Basically your done at that point
If you like you can set your node up to use walletnotify and notify a server php script to act as your IPN (instant payment notification) You will get notify to your server at 0 and 1 confirmations

The elite would be smarter to just start buying up as much as they could and maintain control through wealth inequities i.e. they must learn to enjoy wealth more than control. Then again communists care more about control then wealth.  It's about controlling peoples WILL in the end what 'they' are after. 
Then again maybe they will have an awakening and decide to JOIN rather than control the world.  I doubt it but then again anything is possible.

I will say this again PURE hash power is not security. What makes security is the difference in hash power between the so called 'honest majority' and the 'attack vector'  This is why mining decentralization is just as important as node decentralization. Stop thinking it is HASH alone THAT secures bitcoin. That being said the 'cartel' now has to focus on BCC as well which will actually increase Bitcoin's security by better balancing the remainder.

They support WU coin / Centralize coin s2x! 
I just saw the analytical workup chart shows 95% of nodes will not be able to handle the load in 6 months time. My node could handle it but just barely.
So coinbase basically has a 'bank philosophy' and is happy to centralize bitcoin.
BOYCOTT them COMPLETELY! 
Right now for $20 bucks you can have a dedicated server or vps if your a merchant to handle payments, At 4mb to 8mb that becomes very difficult meaning adoption much harder on the merchant.
The more I look into this , this is not even about mining profits but total control and I would not doubt if State actors are behind this. The entire reason we love crypto is to get away from this LOL whata joke.
The solution is easy however, change the pow to resist asics and DECENTRALIZE the hash power, keep blocksize small like it is now so anybody can run a node.
Since the price is plumeting anyway there is really no reason we can't just fork off to BTCC with a pow tweak and segwit and have what we need moving forward. Forking is not the end of the world and the market quickly value the true bitcoin as one that protects decentralization.
@_date: 2019-05-29 09:41:37
It's not IN fighting cause they forked off. The issue is BTC is friendlier to nodes due to block size being smaller so that more people can run nodes meaning consensus 'where it counts' is more decentralized meaning more free meaning uncensorable meaning it is what we got into crypto in the first place for.

a 51% attack has no juice at all.. it only means we have to wait a few more confirmations. What they need for a real attack is a 90% attack to reorg the chain.

The New York-based firm is reportedly being forced by left-leaning liberal activists to set up an internal “human rights committee” that would monitor payments to “white supremacist groups and anti-Islam activists.”
“The problem is that **everyone has their own views and, in a free society**, the idea of a free society is that you are free to have your belief systems, as long as you’re not harming anyone else physically,” Swann told RT America. “But your belief system belongs to you and you have the right be wrong. White supremacists have the right to be wrong.”
MasterCard is not the only holder of purse-strings that is mulling the selective banning of individuals from their services and funds. Patreon and PayPal have previously barred individuals from receiving payments using their platforms, due to their extreme views.

C no loan out just want my 2.4btc back!
I never had a stitch of problems on finex or houbi/bitvc or 1brk or simple cfd this is ridiculous btw finex lets you take usd profit without KYC IF it was only funded by btc. 
 
If i have to move it to spot from futures then why didn't they just tell me that instead of messing with me for 2 days and sending me 3 emails and calling my wife (the registrant 5 times)?
It is clearly stated that I can withdraw up to 1000 btc per day with level 1.. I have level 1 but they insist on Level 2 now for some reason.
No mate there is much more to this it seems. I hope I'm wrong. I just tweeted R Ver for advice on how to deal with them. See what he says.
re "You do not need the second verification, it just asks for it and does not mean you need to fill it out." Ah funny they said IT WAS REQUIRED .. i explained it was btc only and they kept insisting it was required..  I told them I didnt even remember filling it out cause like it says on the site i only needed level 1 . They insisted i quote "you must have filled it out because it is required"   I mean they are talking out of their backside..

Electrum would that not depend on which server you 'choose' to use as your node? You might have them on both chains but when you go to spend them you better verify which node version your electrum is using or you could get replayed. Same with bitcoin core!

The philosophy of leftism is that of 'authoritative' collective control and the ends justifies the means.  Censorship is the perfect semi violent tool to shape another views and stifle decent.
'Author' itative - its all about speech. even Andreas made that point early on that BTC is speech.  Author ities  , Author itarian..   It's all about authorship of your life. Are you 'the individual' the author or does the group get to author your biography?(democracy) or a leader get to author your life? (authoritarian dictatorship / aristocracy / elite / corprotacacy)  'THE GROUP'
Censorship is abhorrent to the anarchist/voluntarism and to bitcoin.  I tried a few days ago and had a really good reason for this single time censorship in our network but was shot down time and time again. I can appreciate that and have looked for other solutions. Point is the right is about individual sovereignty where principles are right and wrong and we don't sacrafice 1 to save 2.  This is the great frontier approach and yes also of protestant values. This is why Christians tend to be found on the right. Especially protestants. Point is, the Philosophy is about protecting individual human spirit and free will which means NO , true right does not censor.. In fact FAscism is on the left as D'Souza points out.  Media has spun it for so long and we never really fact check.. pls ytube for Dinesh DSouza where he can reference the specifics through history.
The republicans are also left of center leaving JUST libertarians barely right of center and anarchists (an archy .. without rulers) not without rules. Pls research TRUTH on these subjects.. because   to say that the left is compatible with bitcoin would be delusional.

Just warning everyone out there.. something fishy going on or just a systemic glitch?? Will they make it right? 
I think its becoming very risky to give your coins to anybody anymore and like  previous poster said unless you got it in a cold wallet you are taking much risk. But the main reason I deposited to them was I was using their API for our website club members and I kinda felt obligated to do a little trading as well i.e. patronize ok coin a little cause I was using their API and bandwidth right?? Imagine that.. I was so ethical, despite having enough trading accounts elsewhere I felt I had to do the right thing LOL.. IN the end they block my funds .. Holy cow.. I don't know what to say about this world anymore honestly.

There really is VERY LITTLE risk at these major exchanged unless they are outright scammers in which case fraud laws already exist.. The ONLY reason they  want 'regulation' is to track and trace new world order style. They just can't leave others alone. If there is no victim/injured party, all governments should be REGULATED by us to STFU and STFO of of our lives.  If someone gets frauded THEN they already have channels of authority for that. But this PRE CRIMES crap is getting stale and tastes quite bitter.

Don't be Afraid. Be courageous and share that which you consider truth and spread.
When a monopoly of market such as fbook which is known for MASS CENSORSHIP gets into crypto I think it's warranted to educate people on the core principles and why censorship resistance is key to crypto and what separates it from 'digitial money'.

finCen was made by the Bank Secrecy Act and is part of US treasury Department which i kid you not is owned/controlled by the BIS a foreign (nazi created bank) non american private enterprise. Similar to the United States Postal Service which is also FOREIGN OWNED.!
Americans remain DUPED because they just dismiss it out of hand saying 'it just can't be' .. I call that type of denial without research COWARDICE..
America is a nation, The United States is a corporation. The very definition of fascism is corporatism (a far left centralization philosophy) Fasci actually means to bundle and refers to bundling STATE WITH CORPORATE power. That's right Fascism as proven historically by DeSouza shows Fascism is on the left.  But don't get to excited as we have NO RIGHT WING at all.. we have some libertarians but they are a small minority. the GOP is now slightly left of center :(

I'm pretty confident at these prices we are going to see a different type of buyer or more specifically a different ratio of buyers. At these prices spot makes more sense than derivatives. But .1btc buys of spot are not going to delivery the BGD. It's more like death by a thousand cuts (to shorts).
'IF', ( [ ) you do believe in bitcoin long term anything under 50k is really a solid buy. The fundamental consensus model, the talent pool and the network effect is just too good. Long term the borge wins and everyone assimilates. The next bull run , whenever that is, will fomo almost everyone.

Sure there is a very good reason.. and this is what most skeptics are missing..
Ok they take 5% fee for this transfer or 1/20th the amount. So 20 legit transactions is equivelant to them stealing 1 then getting shut down.
So It makes more sense and more money for them to make it legit.  Plus if I didn't get my money I could contact the web-hosting facility and notify them that a website is running  a scam and probably they'd take it down.

Resistance to fundamental value is futile.
The intrinsic value is bitcoin's ability to contract **without trusting** a 3rd party and be guaranteed a **fixed low inflation**.
It's the **'base' of the free market** that we never quite had.
The price of bitcoin however is NOT ABOUT bitcoin it's about **OUR values**. Do we value a free market?  That's not rhetorical, look at the movement on the left their entire philosophy is central control.

Then you got stuff like 'fractional reserve' .. again 'counterfeiting'   .. oh but that doesn't matter as 1 small group is supposed to use that to better 'CONTROL' the entire planets economies... Our economies are not even ours!  How about the term 'financialization' .. on and on..  How about that ties between fudster bitfinexed had with CFTC? a body supposed to 'regulate' our free market.  NO it's all a scam and the ONLY fkn thing on this planet that has any legitimacy is.   
Oh how about 'money laundering' hahah just think  a term denoting, a Heinous  crime supposedly has to borrow terms from a basement laundromat?  THERE IS NO MONEY LAUNDERING .The act is **simply transferring funds!** The only thing that makes it a crime is someone elses 'ACCUSATION' of a wrong doing PRIOR to the 'normal doing' of transacting.

Again this is how our world is going 'guilt until proven innocent' track and trace and police state mentality will ruin our world mark my words.  The free market is changing into an Orwellian communist control mechanism it is very sad for our species.  Without freedom and privacy what does life really have to offer?

I have 160k by Spring of 21. That is if past cycles are a good predictor.  Actually if just take the past cycle the high will be $380k but I think it won't reach it this time and will top out at $160k with a pullback and 'bitcoin is dead' price of $45k to $60k .. so no need to use stablecoins just hodl and sell / use a tiny bit at the top and hodl  another 4 years (480k high then)

 What is truly decentralized is CRYPTO  meaning btc plus alt coins. BTC will fill the main niche the ring leader, in a system of trust-less financial instruments carrying varying amounts of risk and reward with various properties and functions.   Let's not be myopic like some of the mining community and remember if the entire pie grows  it is much better than stealing pie from your partners.
So all 'crypto' is still barely 1/10th the size of apple corp.

Dude have you seen sidechains and lightning? I think sidechains only require a soft fork too so it wouldn't be hard to scale. From my understanding correct me if I'm wrong but they use multi sig addresses to LOCK one side of the chain and open the other chain at same time with same amount.. then when moving back they reverse the locking.. it's quite ingenious actually I don't think scaling will be much of an issue in the near future.
Here take a look at  before you continue vomiting the 'cant scale' garbage line..  FYI i did not downvote you i don't get how harsh people are with down votes just because they don't agree. After all it is opposing opinions that allow us to flush out the details.

At 19,600 I turned to my business partner (web dev stuff) and said we have 3 choices. 
1. Convert it to usd via coinapult (yep crypto capital)
2. Convert it to tether (ehem)
3. Hodl for 4 years.  
I chose hodl 4 years as it was literally the safest thing to do. 
When it hits 160,000 in summer of '21 (cycle is slightly shorter than 4 years)
I will do the same.  And by 2025 I will spend BTC as need be liberally and directly.

**No risk of centralized stablecoin or underlying currency deval** or saggy DAO Maker etc.

Perhaps I have made mistakes yes I am human but they should not have required ID on btc only accounts to begin with. 
Plus this is my wifes coins and I feel terrible I lost her coins or at least there is no certainty I can get them back for her' We did open account together but it was my decision to trust OKCoin and that if we had problems we could resolve it like civilized human beings. I actually bragged about their service as we opened it cause she asked me why do we need another exchange service.. I replied I like the fact that we could use the API since I am a developer working on various bitcoin applications including a trading tool.  OK coins api was pretty nice and they resolved issues I had with it so I figured hey 'they are cool and they got human support via chat'.  I was excited about using the exchange  Now I regret it.  
My wife must now make a trip to her home province to get documents to get an entirely new passport.. And there is no guarantee that they will even accept it which would just cause of futher injury.

You mean the regulators who stop Americans from using any exchange out side of ameriKa?
You mean the regulators who are passing orwellian laws for anti free market capital controls cause it's not your money?

To remove the presumption of innocence is EVIL
To coerce and threaten someone to give up their private property is EVIL
In Western tradition we do not tolerate this aggression as part of our societies.
The ends does not justify the means.
The lessor of two evils is still evil.
I refuse to PRETEND that using our financial system and private property as a political weapon is not a form of communism and is Treasonous to our constitutions and a violation of human rights.

Absolutely spot on Time for core to come out of the closet and NOT MIND fud propaganda .. CORE just do what is best for bitcoin and you know what that is. 
The only reason core did not support it actively is 'the lies promulgated by rbtc' 
We already know the truth and coming out now is perfect timing. Remaining silent just makes their false claim SEEM legit.  Never let propaganda change what is in your heart.
Miners need to make a choice NOW either support users and have a long term profit model or be coded out.  Short term thinking is myopic and profits from here on out will be going down hill fast unless you support 'the users'. If you switch and allow the bug fix and competition, POW change will not be needed. If not we will deal with it. So take a little cut 'temporarily' or be phased out.

Also I'd really like to think bip 148 has a solid chance do you guys have any cogent strategies I can discuss on my ytube and cryptorad ?  
Some people are ok with stagnating and high fees but I really think if we had segwit in place we could scale and I could sleep at night again.
If any body has talking points on how to convince coinbase, finex and stamp to get onboard this would be a huge step.  
I am not a purist and see alt coins as filling niches but I don't want to see bitcoin loose any more market share.

To buy up all the mined coins til the end of the year is $2billion which represents 1 / 3500th of the managed assets. 
or 1/35th of 1%  and I bet 2% is hit within 2 years as a portfolio as a portfolio driver and non correlated asset hedge.  2% would be a raw demand of 140 Billion which would drive market cap 3x to 6x of that.  
But that's just Fidelity probably 3x more players in terms of total institutional demand.  Bitcoin should hit 2T market cap minimum this cycle.

A. we get a accounting firm that already works with NASCAR major players
B. We do a Fill or kill bitcoin escrow.. it reaches amount and we got the fund if not we get refunded.
If we can get 1%  of bitcoiners it would cost around .005 give or take for FULL on team sponsor.. less for smaller logos.. but I want full on sponsorship.  Guess which car I will be rooting for.
Yeah and don't send this to Jimmy as this was just a 'what if' mock up LOL .. but we can find a good team.  
If you guys like it, I will work up a feasibility study and reach out to people in the field.

**My guess is that the downvotes mean a majority of people here think 3200 or so is a bad investment long term.**
**That's pretty astonishing to me considering ..**
the fundamental value of inflation hedging assets.   Short term we are deflating as the banks turn the screws on the foreclosure shakeout machine with Qaunt Tightening.  But every single time ,the blowback will cause an even larger QE.   So long term inflation assets will do very well.
BTC has  only 1.5% of the inflation hedge pie right now so it should do even better as it captures market share.
All the other use case debates are dwarfed when you look at inflation hedge properties and the corresponding capital dedicated to that.

Yes they indeed are talking existing crypto. Why? to prevent speculative attacks when 'they engineer a collapse' You guys should stop being woo'd by the term 'conspiracy tin foil hat' cause it stops you from getting to the truth cause of that label.. The fact is 45% of the globe is controlled by these institutions 'directly controlled'.   The only way the oligarchs can maintain power is to in fact buy into crypto NOW. As it grows so does their reserves. 
Bottom line is this.. In order for oligarchs and wealthy people to HOLD ON to their wealth is to 'buy in' and then literally change their paradigm from parasitic leeching to service. 
Just like bip 148 causes s2x, cryptos will cause finance sector to shift into wealth building through actually serving. Amazing isn't it.

5-year-old girl fined $200 for selling lemonade
Heartless councilmen reduced a 5-year-old girl to tears by shutting down her homemade lemonade stand. The little girl set up a stall selling the homemade drink to music lovers heading to Lovebox festival in East London on Saturday. But the girl had her stand shut down by the local council and was slapped with the £150 ($195)  fine.
Andre Spicer said his daughter burst into tears when enforcement officers from Tower Hamlets council arrived to say they were “trading without a permit” near their home in Mile End.
It's why I don't car about 'THE LAW' anymore.  You need a permit for things that are 'legal' this is the definition of communism &amp; fascism.

1. SLOW DOWN and 
2. record everything you type in even if you think you may not need it. 
Exchanges: make sure everything that is needed for withdrawal is stated as clear as possible. 
Sorry bout the buzz during ether talk had power grid issues.

**US Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly blessed MasterCard’s undertaking**. By doing this, Swann believes the government granted “big corporations the ability to control what voices are heard.”

I kept wondering how the stock markets can keep on rising in the face of bad fundamentals then I found out how much central bank have been buying up 'the means of production' / equities. 
I don't think bitcoin and crypto can survive if societies are under collective and or dictatorial control. I could be wrong but it seems to me we need freedom as a supportive base philosophy for it to work in a practical sense. 
Obviously crypto can't technically be banned however merchants can be harassed there-by killing adoption.  Without a culture of 'live and let live' / voluntary society even crypto won't deliver us out of slavery.

So what was the **root cause** of ALL THIS MESS?
**BANK CENSORSHIP** **~~LAWS~~**   ACTS / STATUTES
The article even admits that bitfinex had no place to go no matte how legit they were no banks would work with them or anybody in crypto.
The bankers are our enemies this much is clear. They are a den of vipers who monopolize all the rules so that no competition can thrive. To use the financial system as a poltical weapon is violent and immoral.
common law:  NO INJURED PARTY NO CRIME! corpus delicti  Transferring money is not a crime.
We do not have common law we have bank law / admiralty law where all people are not created equal.  I ask, here and now, for Jesus to bring judgement upon oppressors  and those that support them, and to free my fellow brothers and sisters from the tyranny of monopoly men.

Bip148 UASF node concept put the breaks on Miner corruption.
ProofOfKeys hodlrs traders puts the breaks on Market corruption.  
Bitcoin fights back every attack it seems.  Not instantly but organically.  Not just corruption and collusion but even things like Greed.  
  
It's as if the bitcoin network is ALIVE!  We all know how awesome the tech side is vis a vis security and sovereignty but what we are constantly ignoring is 'the network of principled people' using it.

Your forgetting the supply demand factors. With segwit in place we are no longer at capacity so the bidding for fees will drop substantially. 
It's all about 'competition' this is why the wu cartel is always against segwit. IF they get big blocks then they can further centralize long term.  BIP 148 adds competition and allows nodes to operate in normal computers.

I can't get withdrawal to work yet either.
I tried calling them via twillio and cant connect. Anybody know how to call  4000-685-598 which is the only number listed.. Not even a country code!  They have ZERO online support despite saying they do on thier website. This is so frustrating.

^^ THIS
 What we accept these days would not have been accepted even 20 years ago.. ehem there wasn't even any KYC back then as business contracts were required to be 'private' as was a basis of western values and free markets.. Now we have slid into a marxist fascist hybrid orwellian nightmare and most just chew bubble gum and go 'oh well'

Klieman was an early miner for sure.  I don't think wright has the keys YET! they might be in an estate trust. if DK's fam wins they will be far less hostile to the market and might even send a good chunk to a burn address. if CW banker shill gets them he would probably dump on the market and boost his shit coin.
