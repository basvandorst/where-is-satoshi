It is not a faith. I see no evidence that Bitcoin is in any way revolutionary, nor that it should hold value simply from existing.

You seem to see my point then.
Your phone analogy doesn't really work as it's not saying the same thing. People not increasing hash rig purchases directly shows that people are less interested in mining. "everyone already has enough GPU to mine with" - This statement doesn't really hold true, as other people increase their mining potential yours goes down

@_date: 2018-05-15 13:18:28
It's nothing to do with a "mentality". You seem to be deliberately missing the point...
I know how Bitcoin is generated and how it comes to be, that is not the issue. The initial posters point was that Bitcoin in some way the most egalitarian way to distribute wealth. That is demonstrably untrue as people who mined early were rewarded with large amounts of bitcoin. Regardless whether you believe this is right or not, the fact that a handful of people who first started playing with an obscure whitepaper got "first dibs" is clearly not egalitarian. What about the people without access to computers, without access to energy to convert?
It's also not still early, 4/5 of all Bitcoin is already in existence.

Bitcoin was so unknown for so long its insane to believe that everyone could have heard of it all equally and therefore that it was fair.
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:33:10
Ok I see what you're saying
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:28:49
Except your argument doesn't work
Difficulty is tied to hashrate of the network. As the difficulty increases (from other people hashing) you need to increase your own hashrate to continue to break even. Otherwise just by staying still you will be less likely to mine bitcoins. If bitcoin mining market wasn't declining you should see a steady rise in hashrates (read mining power)
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:08:08


Except those that were able to mine early were rewarded more, so it wasn't a fair distribution that everyone could participate in equally
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:45:01

@_date: 2018-06-14 11:27:36
Because printing Tether isn't the same as printing money. Tether is printing internet tokens to manipulate the price of BTC. They can then trade on the BTC price variations and sell to other people for real money, e.g. USD.

One of the properties of money which is regularly cited is as a "medium of exchange" - you must stimulate trade using your currency if you want it to become considered as money.
I guess we will always both disagree, but i've enjoyed discussing it with you.

He arbitrarily removes outliers to get a result he wants:
"Visual inspection of the plot about indicates that tether outlier points may have a strong influence on the correlation. Removing tether outliers (daily change of market cap &gt; 20%) leads to the correlation coefficient of -0.08335 (p-value is 0.1159, which is not significant)."
He only removed the outliers as they supported the hypothesis that Tether DOES affect Bitcoin price


@_date: 2018-06-29 11:31:51
Not sure why Greshams Law would prevent this? Bitcoin does not have any physical real world value like a gold, silver or copper coin would.
I also don't understand the argument that increasing prices drives adoption. Adoption is not happening if no-one spends their coins as there is zero incentive for any merchant to accept BTC as no-one will be willing to part with them. Holding (I refuse to use 'hodl') BTC does not itself drive price increases
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:07:43
Im yet to see you make any sort of point about how holding Bitcoin is better for Bitcoin overall than spending nor any discussion of how it relates to Greshams law as I asked earlier. 
You have asked many questions but provided no arguments to back up your original assertions
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:25:37
Except that is not how Greshams law works. Gresham's law only applies if the two currencies in question have their exchange rate set by law (this is missed by many), and if the tokens (metal when this was formulated) have intrinsic value elsewhere. 
Also if this is your view of adoption then how is it any different to me sitting on and holding any other rareish thing? Anyone can create a crypto token (the whitepaper tells you how and the proliferation of altcoins shows Bitcoin is not unique). Why would Bitcoin hold value just for sake of holding above any other token? Why would any crypto token hold value when any other can be created and minted in any numbers?

An audit looks at sources and uses of funds over time, as well as rights to funds and obligations to pay funds, all of which impact the state of Tether's reserves, and none of which are addressed in this report.
A report that was carried out by lawyers, not accountants, was not performed under any attestation standards, and is so limited in scope as to be useless as evidence.
I think you miss the point that where the money has come from, obligations of payments from those funds etc. are all integrally important to the question of whether or not these actually back Tether.
Take this hypothetical situation: A multi-billionaire transfers exactly the right sum of money to the two banks the morning of the lawyers performing the check. The lawyers check with the bank the sums of money, all looks good. That afternoon the billionaire transfers the money out. In this situation we have the same attestation report but how much money is in the bank backing the Tether....
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:56:37
That's reasonable. But I would say two things. It's main function, as a store of value came about organically over thousands of years because of its desirability and rarity. It was not arbitrarily chosen.
Secondly, its use as a store of value is declining. As markets grow the percentage of wealth stored in gold is declining
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:47:14
How is it different?
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:23:32
Sure and as such its a pointless statement with zero meaning.

@_date: 2018-06-29 12:48:16
Depends what you mean by adopted and in use? If you're asking me if I believe people convert their money into gold routinely or use gold to make purchases then no, or certainly not commonly. 
If you're asking me if I believe gold has value then yes it does, it is coverted for its use to make jewellery and its aesthetic value which gives it a high real world value because of its rarity (a combination of both desire and rarity)
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:02:56
21e8 is also not 21million, so it takes some massaging to even make it a number related to BTC
@_date: 2018-06-18 11:48:07
Why should they be protecting people against their own stupidity? If they stopped you doing these things I imagine you would be complaining about the bank stopping you doing what you wanted with your own money
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:12:44
That doesn't back up your claim. The document specifically states the balance on a single day, June 1st. Why not provide a sequence of balances as suggested above?
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:16:28
Absolute list of caveats on how this is in no way an audit
"1) FSS is not an accounting firm and did not perform the above review and confirmations using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
2) The  above  confirmation  of  bank  and  tether  balances  should  not  be  construed  as  the  results  of  an audit and were not conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards.
3) FSS  makes  no  representation  regarding  the  sufficiency  of  the  information  provided  to  FSS  and  all inquiries  made  by  FSS  have  been  directed  to  the  Client  and/or  third  party  personnel  responsible for maintaining  such  information,  and  the data  has  been  obtained  from  the  Client  and/or  third  party personnel responsible for maintaining such information.
4) FSS  procedures  performed  are  not  for  the  purpose  of  providing  assurance  and  are  limited  to  the findings listed above as of June 1st, 2018, Close of Business.  FSS has not performed any procedures or made any conclusions for activity prior to or subsequent to June 1st, 2018, Close of Business.
5) FSS  did  not,  as  part  of  the  Engagement,  arrive  at  any  conclusions  as  to  Tether’s  compliance  with applicable laws and regulations in any jurisdiction. 
6) FSS has assumed, without further inquiry, that the bank personnel providing the confirmations were duly authorized to provide such confirmations, and that the confirmation"
It does matter incidentally, because where the money comes from is important. That is why an audit (they are still unwilling to provide) is the only way to know that Tether is legitimate
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:50:20
Except this market is unregulated and various trading schemes which are outlawed and illegal on regulated exchanges "wash trading, painting the tape, spoof trading, etc." all happen here as a matter of normal course.
As to who cares? Anyone with any money invested in Bitcoin should care as they have invested real money into an artificially inflated speculative asset. When Bitfinex can no longer get away with making millions at other peoples expense the whole thing will collapse

"What is so privileged about tether compared to the other 2000 scam coins?"
Because it is CLAIMED (and never proven) that it is backed 1:1 with the USD. This doesn't make it a scam coin in the sense of the other scam coins but claims to provide a literal coin to currency tether

Not sure why you're throwing Ad Hominem attacks in here. Yes, English is my first language.
I never said that this was your argument, but it is an argument being made, I believe by the CEO of Tether.

I can't trust the second article you posted. He arbitrarily removes outliers to get a result he wants:
"Visual inspection of the plot about indicates that tether outlier points may have a strong influence on the correlation. Removing tether outliers (daily change of market cap &gt; 20%) leads to the correlation coefficient of -0.08335 (p-value is 0.1159, which is not significant)."
He only removed the outliers as they supported the hypothesis that Tether DOES affect Bitcoin price
@_date: 2018-06-21 12:42:21
Sure, generally they do. But is disingenuous to say that pure rarity makes something valuable

The truth is its a comprehensively written analysis which just so happens to go against what you believe in.
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:43:23

"There is far too much infrastructure and investment to let BTC disintegrate"
This is known as a sunken cost fallacy
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:22:24
Except I did answer it. The fact the business is related to crypto is not relevant. An audit is about cash flows, liabilities and balances. Whether the buesines sells cabbages or cryptocoins doesn't change the fact that money flows in and money flows out.
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:26:11
Honest question, what basis do you reconcile the very different ideas you seem to hold. From your post I guess you believe that Bitcoin will take over as a global currency, presumably from widespread adoption, yet you espouse holding which goes completely against gaining mainstream adoption through use.
Why don't you use Bitcoin if you believe in it so much as a currency?
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:27:16
It's of consequence because that money needs to be totally liquid and solely for the purpose of Tether exchange.
Let's imagine for a second that a large portion of the money is in fact some sort of loan. This is important as the money is both an unpaid debt AND a placeholder for a tether token. This would make it in this instance a form of Ponzi.
I don't know if this is the case, no one does as there has been no audit. But it proves my point that the source of the money IS important to the question of whether Tether can actually cover the cost of all Tethers
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:40:40
You are correct in what you say, no arguments there. I will draw a distinction between "drawing people in" and "adoption". These are not the same thing in my view.
Adoption is actually using Bitcoin as a viable currency. If people are grabbing and holding then it is purely a speculative asset with no value. People are only deriving value from the belief that someone later on will buy the coins from them for a higher value. If no-one actually uses the coin for anything, if you can't trade them for goods or services then this house of cards value will crash down.
@_date: 2018-06-21 08:29:34
This is such a nonsense argument. They don't need to understand crypto technology in any meaningful way to audit where that money came from
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:56:10
How is it a better mechanism for adoption?
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:27:17
You know this is not an audit right?
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:31:14
Nope. I think a lot of people say they are in it for the technology but I believe the overwhelming majority are hoping they can buy it now for X and sell it later for Y (where Y is many multiples of X)
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:54:15
It's also important because it says at a very specific point in time, people we ask confirmed this money was there. It does not independently confirm that from audit nor does it make any indications of where that money is from or how it got there
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:40:22
Because an audit actually verifies where money has come from. As stated above, a snapshot in time does not give any indication of where the money is from. That's absolutely critical to the question of whether Tether is truly backed by the dollar

There is zero evidence that he is a billionaire. In fact Trump's lawsuit was thrown out of court as he was unable to prove that a claim that he had less than 200 million was libelous.
He is an awful investor. The money he took from his Dad has gone down in value compared to if he had just left it in an account gathering interest. His investments lose money. No bank in America will loan him money anymore and he is currently over $300m in debt to Deutsche bank.

No offence dude but I call bullshit. 
In the UK you are likely to be turned away from depositing coins if you have not sorted them properly into individual bags of the same coin of a fixed value. For instance you may be asked to collect £2 coins into bags valuing £20. This allows them to be weighed and deposited.
More than likely they were just trying to limit you to avoid having to deal with everyones loose change everyday. Many banks (I know mine does) have coin deposit machines with no limits.

How can you possibly justify the statement that crypto will hold value as well as precious metals?
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:48:49


You have no justification on this. Go back more than say, a year, and very few people outside of a technical niche had heard of bitcoin. It is still new so there is no evidence it will hold its value. In fact most indicators point to Bitcoin being in a speculative bubble. 
You say it will usefully hold its value but its volatility shows clear 30% swings in a matter of days / hours. Volatility which is almost certainly caused by deliberate market manipulation (much like the meteoric price rise).
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:32:27
Fair point on the mining difficulty.
I guess my point was more that miners won't keep mining if Bitcoin is not profitable. "Not profitable" is in relation to the value of a coin and the value of a coin is entirely what someone will pay for it, not what a miner believe it is worth.
So when you say that no miner is going to give away a coin for free you are right, but conversely a miner isn't going to bother mining if there is no market demand for bitcoins.

Your calculation isn't correct. There are only 16 hexadecimal characters, not 26. Additionally you're calculating in ASCII rather than pure bytes, so you should reflect that as a better measure.
11000 hex characters is 5500 bytes of raw information or 2^(5500*8), it is not equivalent to brute forcing this number however.
You're also assuming that any break would have to be a brute force. There are potentially other avenues faster than a brute force which would weaken it which is why quantum computing is a worry for traditional cryptographic hashing.
Note: Size of hash signature does not necessarily correlate with complexity of solve. Compare an RSA signature to an ECDSA signature for example

It's not the same as slavery.
You can't get away from the fact that Leviticus and Exodus explicitly stated slavery is ok, no mention of murder or other transgression, just the enslavement of conquered people. If you deny this you are simply being dishonest.

There is something in gambling called expected gains. 
In your example above, taking 10k represents an expects gain of 10k (the win is 10k but it was 100% you got it). In the other case the expected gain is 50k (100k with a 50% chance to win means averagely, people make 50k from that deal if extrapolated).
So I would say the 'wise' choice depends. The second has much better expected gains, but 10k is guaranteed. It is certainly not unwise to choose the latter.
In your example of doing it ten times it's an absolute no-brainer. The chances of you coming off with less than 100k by gambling each time is tiny.

It's not a sensible test though. It's relatively easy to get a chocolate bar and verify it is what you say it is. It's hard to vet in the spot that a silver bar is a silver bar. Given a choice between two things the person is making a gamble, I can choose a low value item which I am sure is what I believe it to be or a high value item I have little knowledge of which could turn out to be fake and worthless.
Add in the fact that people probably have no idea how to turn a silver bar into a form of money they can actually use, will I have to pawn it? Will a bank charge me fees to accept it?
I'm not surprised people didn't want the bar, even if it is worth more

I would personally err away from the term investment. If you buy Bitcoin you are not contributing to the development of anything or owning a stake in anything. It is speculation in its purest form.
I can find you many more secure / as secure databases. Do they fit the exact use case of a crowdsourced, distributed ledger? No. Do I believe 99.999% of database use cases require a crowdsourced distributed ledger? No.
I have been in the tech business a long time and I genuinely could not give you a use case for Blockchain where there isn’t already a better alternative. 
Edit: In terms of speculation, no it’s not necessarily a bad idea, but when a lot of people do it at once on a product which actually does not have the fundamental  underlying value, that is when bubbles are produced

Show the passage...
I have quoted teo sources which back me up, you are making unfounded assertions. My two books prove my point, show me a passage which proves yours.

No, I think its money because I can exchange it for goods and services anywhere in the country.

Nope. I have money in my pocket. Never once thought FRN was money

Shhhhhh. Dude doesn't really do it, he just likes to tell people that

I've read it. It says nothing about slavery as retribution for murder.
So it still stands that God condones slavery in the Old Testament in explicit terms.

Do you pay taxes now? If not you should stop using everything tax money buys or has bought immediately

I think it's up to a private company to choose who they associate with their image. 
You're talking about socialism, but socialism would say that the company should take every customer. The opposite of what you're arguing. The anti-socialist view would be that they are free to choose, which is what they're doing

I need proof to believe in things.
The Bible is full of immoral teachings and I'd rather make my own moral compass
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:41:47
I don't get this. It's not even a little bit Orwellian. A payment company is providing a service and has decided it doesn't want to tie it's image to processing payments for a man sprouting fairly strong right wing views which stir up hate.
They have an image and they decided they don't wish to to associated with processing for a extreme right. Good on them
Edit: Heavily downvoted. People obviously don't understand what Orwellian means

I thought you were anti taxes?
@_date: 2018-12-31 16:30:37
So you should stop using public amenities
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:06:17
You can. Anyone with the public key can pull the data out of a cryptographic signature thus verifying it. The important bit is that only the holder of the private key can create it.
Maybe you should educate yourself more

I hear this a lot. "Bitcoin is the true coin, all other coins are shitcoins". Why is Bitcoin any different? They're all built on the same tech.
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:53:50
It's not a state decision though is it. It's pure capitalism, a private company deciding who it will allow to be it's customer. 
Not sure why you've lumped Satanism in with the Left, not any examples you have of "extreme" leftism

I have no idea what you're talking about. He sold enough to cover his initial investment and now it's playing with house money. He cannot 'lose' anything and any remaining Bitcoin he has are a totally risk free gamble
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:53:09
Sure. But I can do all those things without an incredibly slow database.
I don’t disagree Bitcoin can do those things, I disagree it does them better or even equally as well.  I’d also say people aren’t doing those things now, people are using it as a speculative investment on the whole, hoping to buy in and sell off to a person in the future for more money.

I can fairly guarantee I have studied it more extensively than yourself

Not heard of it before so I checked the website. I buy a prepaid credit card with BTC, then use it to buy goods in..... wait for it..... fiat
You've given me a mechanism to exchange bitcoin for fiat. If bitcoin was currency why could I not just pay using that? 
So it's actually people on the internet telling you that bitcoins money. I can buy things with my money

Not going to happen. But we can come back here in a few years and check
@_date: 2018-12-26 11:07:49
Nope. The Bible supports taking slaves not as punishment. Read these yourself for confirmation:
Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT or
Exodus 21:2-6 NLT

You're proud you got hundreds of people to buy in when the price was over 200% higher than today? How do hey feel about your advice losing them a lot of money?
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:37:25
Sure. If you're able. Not saying you're guaranteed to be able to do it but if you get the opportunity you should (with an incredibly risky investment like Bitcoin).

Not sure what a video from 1991 about US taxation will do for me.

They solved problems. Amazon solved the problem of providing an online bookshop that was cheap, convenient and had huge choice. It may not be a particularly noble problem to solve. Noble problems generally don’t with money making attached to them.
So your feeling on crypto is more about the social change than about how they will perform?
@_date: 2018-12-24 14:30:14
To be honest it depends on the scheme. I must admit that I thought Bitcoin was RSA based signatures, which would have made it encryption based
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:17:35
Why do you want to be immune from taxation?
How is the stock market more fraudulent that the bitcoin market? Bitcoin markets are full of manipulation and not protected against it. Wash trades, painting the tape,etc.

I'm not actually American so I looked it up, as I know political views are not covered under my law against discrimination. So I looked up US law and saw its the same.

Like I said, your reading comprehension is poor :)
I'll leave this final bit for you.
" Warcaptives could be made slaves, assuming they had refused to make peace (this applied to women and children — men were simply killed), along with the seizure of all their property (Deuteronomy 20:10-15)."

Obviously not if you read his question

Pedophilia is not a social value of the left, no idea where you pulled that bullshit from.
They should definitely take their non-pedophilia views from the Catholic Church though.... Oh, wait, widescale pedophilia rings and coverups.
Also given the Bible promotes slavery it's not something I'm going to use as a moral compass I'm afraid
