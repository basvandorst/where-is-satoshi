But when [Daily Mail]( posts the news, people think it's "fresh".

Paypal volume = sales mostly
Credit Card volume = sales
Bitcoin volume = transfer between wallets + sales
It'd be great if Bitpay, Coinbase and companies alike released their daily sales volume, since at least half (or more) of merchants that accept BTC uses one of their services.

maybe satosha?

Yeah, his site won't work here either. I turned off my modem, so there's that...

But what about when people started requesting withdraws but all of the desposits was already spent by Mark and his gang? The only way they could get money for these withdraws was by two options: 1) Loan or 2) Selling its customers' BTC at various BTC exchanges to get the money back.
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:14:19
Wait what?
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:48:26
Maybe the other draft was an old one (that was prepared in case anything had gone wrong) and this one is a recent (since it says about December 2013).
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:06:28
Until they prove that they have bitcoins to withdraw, I will still believe that they already sold at least half of their customers' coins at other exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:50:16
Any ETA?
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:00:52
That would explain how they manage to get into Mt Gox servers and Mark's reddit and blog so easily, it probably wasn't even an exploit.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:24:45
It didn't need to be huge though, if they "dumped" 100 coins every hour, that'd be 2400 a day between multiples exchanges, nothing out of the ordinary.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:26:38
Yeah, I know that early adopters are in this for the long haul, but Mt Gox is done. They "allegedly" lost 740k customers' BTC and were hacked in the same week. Who would invest in that?
And even in theoretical world where Mt Gox lives, how much BTC do you think customers would withdraw on the first day back? Well, at least half of the 740k that they "lost".
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:25:24
Please, let me have faster internet.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:18:03
Why would I loan 740k BTC to Mt Gox which probaly make less than 2 mil USD/year, when I can sell my BTC at another exchange and get 2 million in less than 10 seconds without dropping the price by 5% and would still have 737k BTC? It's way easier for them to get 500k USD and launch a new top BTC exchange.

Until BCH difficulty goes down again on the emergency adjustment and then the cycle continues.

Why is bitcoin skyrocketing so hard this year? On some other occasions that this happened it was like a bubble and the price went back to what it was (or near it) after some time. But since October it went from $600 to $4000 now and from a guy that doesn't follow closely bitcoin, I can't understand why.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:03:26
Until there's a real audit from a big accounting firm for both Bitfinex (like they promised after their hack in 2016) and Tether (that always promised and never delivered), then the "fudsters" can calm down.

How do venezuelans can afford miners/GPUs since last time I heard a Big Mac is like a month's salary there? With that logic a single miner would be really expensive.

Someone posted pics of his session on the [Just-Dice thread on Bitcointalk](

But the probability of a whale with more than 1000 BTC (which already puts this person as one of the top 3 whales ever on the site or even the biggest one) to bet, win 2 days in a row in 3 different accounts (with different seeds each one) using the most common strategy (which is bet HI/LO and 49.5% until you profit) is something like 0.000001% (no calculations made, just guessed a really improbable number, which I surely know it would be less than 0.01%).
Yeah, it's possible, but it's like a meteor is gonna hit earth in the next 15 days.

Their FAQ explains how the game works and why it's a fair game (not cheated so the house can win).
But like all others "provably fair" games, this site isn't the only one that's "fair".

Their flashplayer has a memory leak (at least on Firefox for me). All of their videos do the same "crash" here and this is the ONLY site that this happens.
@_date: 2013-09-22 19:27:49
Seriously? Two days in a row and the guy pushed the site's profit to negative?
This can't just be luck.
When I try to bet HI with less than 1 BTC at 49.5%, I can loose as many as 10 times in a row. Then I randomize my seeds and a few hours later again, 8 times in a row. How the fuck can this guy PROFIT betting like this?
I know that out of 100 bets and betting HI at 49.5%, you'll probably win like 48 to 52 times, but you'll never profit as much as this guy.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:21:42
Me too, and I mean the $250 part.
@_date: 2013-08-03 22:57:04
I think it's clear now but who knows?
According to Sucuri SiteCheck, only [SiteAdvisor (from McAfee)]( that accuses of cointaing malware. Even [Google Safe Browsing]( say it's apparently clean now.
And from the [VirusTotal Malware Scanner]( it shows that only 4 of a total of 39 antivirus detected as a malware.
Of the majors antivirus companies, only Sophos detected it.

You could use  to see if it's profitable to keep this mining hardware.
At 180 GH/s, you'll MAYBE find a block (25 BTC) in 10 days if you're solo mining. It deppends on your lucky, could be few hours or more than 10 days.
If you don't want to sell it, you should join a pool like the other comments suggested, since they reward you for your "Accepted" shares. BTCGuild is the biggest, followed by [50BTC](
@_date: 2013-09-22 20:28:08
you're seeing while nakowa's getting rich, everyone else (investors) is losing BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:17:14
Yeah, you could say it's low but for a small exchange, having a daily volume of almost 1 million USD (with BTC and LTC), I'd say it's something.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:29:42
That's super safe! Who wouldn't use a third party (who can be hacked or scammed) wallet to leave your $11 millions?
@_date: 2013-10-19 15:48:30
Any particular reason why are they boosting bitcoin again?

If the guy who made that video really had the private key to that account, first of all, he wouldn't be making that video and would be throwing a lot of bitcoins on Mt. Gox to win his first million.
"Oh, I just won the lottery! Gotta go make a video first!"

Also, he said that the FBI has the largest bitcoin wallet (because of silk road) and Satoshi Nakamoto has the largest ammount of bitcoins (between various wallets).
He also compares Bitcoin with Napster, saying that it might not be successful, but it will start a "revolution".
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:06:06
Yeah, right after BTC keeps breaking its all time high everyday.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:57:36
Yesterday was 280 BTC and 10000 LTC, IIRC.
edit: 10,000, not 10.000 :D my bad
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:54:57
Well, this account is probably theirs. Since this address is well known ( and they stated a while ago that they had $11 mil in bitcoin, which at the $100/BTC rate is right.
