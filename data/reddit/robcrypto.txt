Bitcoin forever! To the moon
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:58:40
Yup... funny thing is it happens every year this time... nothing new! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:07:30
LOL so true... only thing I did was switching from Verge to NAV... but that's just because NAV has so much more potential to grow than Verge ✌��
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:36:07
For sure ✌��
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:23:26

@_date: 2018-01-21 19:03:35
Bitcoin is GREAT 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:22:26
Yes...but others end tomorrow
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:20:40
Bitcoin  is crashing... will decline to $8k levels... after this crash it's time for altcoins to shine!
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:55:12
Trade.io, Tokenbox &amp; Tokens.net will be the decentralised exchanges of the future! 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:02:15
Old man... why do you cry ��
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:55:00
Take a breath before we go up again! Nice movement!
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:06:26
Yuup... LOL
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:25:48
Spammers have fear... WE HAVE BTC! ✌
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:18:23
Futures expire tomorrow... Big money will bet on LONG for next futures so we will all be good in a few weeks!
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:30:32
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:08:27

@_date: 2018-01-23 06:33:08

Litebit.eu or Anycoindirect
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:00:53
My top 5: NAVcoin, Lisk, RISE, Vertcoin  &amp; UTRUST
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:30:00
Market manipulation before regulation kicks in... after that it will take off... what we have seen so far was a pre start!
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:10:50
Whales trying to trigger another sell off by noobs selling low so they can buy all... so far volume still low... seems not to much panic... all waiting for bullrun
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:00:11
Yes we will see it... HODLers deserve the biggest rewards!
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:28:46
Almost two third of the worldpopulation have no Access to a bankaccount... only papermoney. In times almost everyone has access to internet... cryptocurrency will become the solution to safely store and pay with cryptocurrency. Filling up the gap big bank conglomerates created in the past decades. There is a very promising and big future for cryptocurrencies... nothing can stop this revolution!

@_date: 2018-02-05 08:35:39
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:43:12
Funny fact is you are all wrong because... Bitcoin  will do what Bitcoin is gonna do ✌��
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:29:17
You seem to be one of the speculators LOL
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:58:29
Only losers and people who live in fear sell now LMAO
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:30:12

@_date: 2018-02-05 14:31:30
One year late then��
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:46:05
Seems like a beartrap!
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:42:20
Stupid post
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:14:44
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:42:44
I think so yes. Its logical IMO. Don't expect to much from G20... will be used to create FUD though... LOL
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:38:16
Compared to then we are in 1995... and IMO your analysis is incomplete... with a full analysis you will come to a different conclusion. Cheers 
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:00:35

@_date: 2018-02-06 14:12:55
This guy is doomed
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:39:50
True... but it has no walls
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:48:05
I always like to see positive people..... pity there will always be a pessimist to spoil the party! Those pessimists I see rather leave this space sooner than later LOL
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:45:14
Pointless
