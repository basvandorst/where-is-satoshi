I think the seeds are generally generated in software on the computer and sent to the trezor.. although maybe it can work both ways.. but yea there's always a risk that either the software or the trezor isn't generating proper random numbers.. the best way might be to use dice to generate the seed and then import that to the trezor.. of course maybe it could still leak the keys through the signatures a few bits at a time..

I'm not convinced that would necessarily work in a malicious trezor scenario. It could leak the master seed a few bits at a time regardless of what it was signing.. I guess it might make it harder to identify which signatures to look at to extract the signal, but that probably isn't very difficult.
The fact that so many crypto devices don't allow external initialization worries me.. the argument that people will do it badly themselves (or use buggy software) is one thing, but by not allowing it at all it really does force you to trust them and why would they force you unless they wanted to leave the door open to exploiting that trust?

Forget credit cards.. localbitcoins is a pretty good option the lowest seller is only about 4% over spot (for instant, faster payments online method).. for cheaper BTC I recommend opening a fidorbank.uk current account and using it to send money to kraken.com. They offer £2.49 SEPA transfers with negligible fx cost.. the kraken EUR market is also far more liquid than any available GBP market.

 Gold Market Cap: ~ 6300 billion USD
 Bitcoin Cap: 16 billion USD
Still some way to go.

Basically no. sorry. Kraken may allow you to buy up to $2000 per day without Id verification (via SWIFT bank transfer) though.

could be but i don't really believe you.

tbh I'm not really sure.. but it would require a malicious firmware.. probably it would leak information by using bad k (random) values.. obviously they would need to look more or less random, but in practice they could be derived from a pre-programmed key shared with the attacker and the trezor and offset by some amount to leak the data.

Is it really so much fiat anyway? Like sure it's great that nigeria or venezuela are using bitcoin more than before, but realistically surbitcoin's volume is still ~20BTC per day. It makes a nice news item, but it isn't very real.

almost certainly not. One cheaper option is to use gdax.com (coinbase exchange) instead. Alternatively, selling on localbitcoins can even be profitable (ie, negative fees).. although there is some risk.

heavily used? The BTCEUR has 2.40 BTC of trading volume in the past 24hrs.. sure better than 0 but let's not exaggerate.

I dunno, probably the 1m btc will end up being pledged in a similar manner to gold is now as collateral to a loan - but never actually spent.

almost certainly a scam site.. promotes it in almost every comment he made
