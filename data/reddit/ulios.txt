How is not winning the election important? Its basically just throwing money into a fire. Nothing good will come of donating to these people.
@_date: 2014-04-28 19:32:58
Yes. They can make one.
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:49:17
Its a statement that I believe rings true with anything, blindly following anything is stupid. Denying deflation is bad is false.
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:45:54
I'm 14 and I know this shit... 
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:08:08
Thats a lot of money?
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:02:13
@_date: 2014-03-12 00:21:14
If apple really wanted too, i'm sure they could get some sort of a legislation to pass banning Bitcoin purchases and or transactions.
@_date: 2014-04-22 02:09:06
We are trying to make a profit.
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:32:06
No I definitely agree with that... But in all of your scenarios that would occur.
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:46:05
No, thats not the logic... *facepalm
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:51:11
Is every bitcoin thread a circlejerk like this?
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:10:53
Debt is a crucial part of the economy... 
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:04:22
You cant write off everything.
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:31:09
This is good for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-04-09 02:31:20
It really isn't a ton of money in a lot of places.
@_date: 2014-04-09 02:30:49
How do you suggest someone goes about that?
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:48:34
LOL! WHAT!
@_date: 2014-03-28 08:01:15
So what are you saying? There is this huge but not vocal at all majority of anarchists?
@_date: 2014-06-18 04:32:22
Wrong, and Wrong.
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:41:08
You do realize the swiss vote on tons of things right? Basic income is retarded, and most libs would agree, you aren't going to get much support here.
@_date: 2014-05-07 04:41:56
Dat exponential growth...

@_date: 2014-03-26 20:23:02
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:56:35
I'll dig one up a bit later, but do you honestly believe that they could possibly donate 100% if you specified that, they pay for the keys in bulk from devs taxes, wages and more.
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:34:39
Oh god again!
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:20:36
@_date: 2014-06-28 13:29:54
  
And I never said anything about there being a lot of millionaires.  
And I dont know what that article even means about the smuggling... I've been to Singapore you can buy gum... And 3500 Singaporean Dollars not USD more like $2799.33 USD.
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:07:30
You are mistaken.
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:17:01
Lets be honest here, not all the redditors here are honest.
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:39:24
Wtf is wrong with you people.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:59:16
You cant 'destroy' a bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-12 12:43:50
Which is still bad, do you fucking retards not understand deflation?!?!?
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:21:32
Except it's a scam. Well I guess I already knew you guys love scams.
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:59:03
No, its saying if you could get just 1% of something when 1% doesn't sound like much but in reality is.
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:49:43
Bitcoin will result in more inequality. It is already like that.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:28:27
The people give every form of money value. Bitcoin is no different in that front, so are you saying Fiat is backed my math aswell.
@_date: 2014-05-28 17:43:19
Would you recommend someone with miners to do that?
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:42:05
Thats dumb.
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:58:21
If it seems like enough i'd be glad to support it.
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:51:50
It isn't backed by 'math'
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:55:58
What does age have to do with anything?
@_date: 2014-06-28 11:17:26
You are actually retarded... Do you pull stuff out of your ass? Not richest country per capita in the world, hardly an "authoritarian" gov't, its just gum is outlawed to keep the country clean, its a fine if you are caught with it. And foreigners are allowed gum.
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:15:55
Inflationary Spirals are a thing, but its a insanely larger amount compared to what we have currently.
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:23:09
Yeah, because it isn't a global economy and people that blindly follow Bitcoin without realizing its flaws are idiots.
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:18:27
No, doubt it.
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:59:48
You are hopeless. We get it, everybody in the world is wrong and you are right.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:50:30
Thats not why they have value.
@_date: 2014-04-28 20:10:58
By penny stock I mean, listen on OTC boards. This isn't shocking.

@_date: 2014-03-26 19:29:50
Exactly you are creating a asset, you have to pay taxes on that. When you sell for Fiat at a profit you are generating income that you will have to pay taxes on.
@_date: 2014-05-22 05:50:04
It's not steam that gives them keys either way...
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:46:20
Its a penny stock...
@_date: 2014-04-14 15:48:32
... So when you forget you lose everything? Or if you die there is no way for you're heir to get it?
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:35:32
Lib party in USA, 0 seats right now.
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:43:19
Replace doge with Bitcoin, still makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:53:11
Could be.
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:16:07
I dont think deflationary means what you think it means.

You are buying a product, which the company gives some of the money to donations.
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:45:30
If they wanted to and banned Bitcoin it would fail. And burn. It isn't the high level of importance you think it is.
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:35:10
Depends on how early you are referring too. Early early 10k from mom.
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:22:38
These things look fun!
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:00:58
This issue with these 10x graphs is the fact that for it to go up 10x from where it is now. It would have to go up 100x where it was before to reach those points.

@_date: 2014-03-26 14:54:48
This sub is comedy gold!
@_date: 2014-05-19 12:35:29
So basically 24/7/365 purge? Sounds AMAZING!
@_date: 2014-07-11 12:31:03
Ah, Bitcoin solving problems that aren't problems!
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:55:37
Sue, sue, sue. Either way why have that much money in there.
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:23:25
Yes it is. Realized vs unrealized.
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:46:28
I made better investments than Bitcoin in that timeframe.
@_date: 2014-05-11 06:39:50
Yes they do.
@_date: 2014-04-09 03:00:08
I think the constant belief on this sub that it will continue with exponential growth, or even have another instance of it are delusional.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:53:35
No that isn't correct.
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:09:30

@_date: 2014-04-28 12:38:07

How do you order it? I cant figure out :D

I invested in HEMP for one week with 330% gains just a couple months ago for one, ACLP, various penny stocks.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:09:20
Capital loss.
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:37:29
Thats hardly what FOREX is.
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:14:18
I think many of the people you think of as trolls are really just people that are either angry they didn't get in soon enough, or they find the attitude in the subreddit annoying. I'm more of the second but I try to keep a logical discussion. But for some people they just might be angry they didn't get in soon enough, they might have also gotten scammed or gotten in when the price was really high.

How many seats have they won?
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:54:58
How is it not honest? Did you really think all 100% could possibly go to charity if you specified that?
@_date: 2014-05-04 23:15:58
Buying $9995 miner for Doge, the wow is real in this one... 
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:26:54
You appear to have only a million doge, thats about $400 is that correct?

@_date: 2014-03-26 16:37:41
Thats not it, its that its very speculative and high risk.
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:08:14
So we replace something really really shitty with something just really super shitty? What an upgrade.
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:52:21
God these arguments are so terrible. Arguing based off of how many people could possibly use the product is a terrible way to look at things. No reputable business looks at it that way.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:46:04
How much?
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:12:27
Any of you heard of weselldoges.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:22:35
Total number of coins x price. Pretty simple.
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:10:23
No such thing as free money.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:47:15
The equipment (miner) could be a tax write off, you are buying the equipment for sales tax, and any profits made would be income. How is that hard to understand.

How is that a lame way, would you rather have useful currency or useless. Take your pick, hint bitcoin is the useless one!
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:00:56
Honestly the larger quantity sounds better.
@_date: 2014-05-12 12:42:24
So instead deflation? We all know how that works. Well you bozos might not.
@_date: 2014-04-26 04:12:08

@_date: 2014-03-26 19:09:50
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:02:15
Bitcoin isn't investing, it's gambling.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:26:46
@_date: 2014-06-03 13:06:23
Ah this again, when you have no real answer you go back and resort to, Bitcoin is mind-blowing technology!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:16:22
No! Thats 100% false, cant say i'm surprised as you seem fascinated by Bitcoin, it's obvious you don't know how banks work.
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:26:26
Them Mathz!


@_date: 2014-03-17 17:09:26
Its more of a joke.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:49:37
Okay? And...
@_date: 2014-03-29 04:02:48
Its true.
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:04:30
Thats how bankruptcy works... Are you fucking stupid? You really think if the government and courts we're absent Mark (if he has them) would've given the Bitcoins back? Are you fucking retarded. I'm quite free market myself but you sound stupid, how are officials ripping people off a second time.
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:53:28
Wat the fuck, this sub has reached a new level of retard.

Such prize many crap.
@_date: 2014-04-23 12:45:16
Its probably 10x worse in Benin.
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:03:33
1.2% isn't that significant.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:49:53
Its the total number of coins :)
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:10:04
What do you mean 'let the free market decide? Thats exactly what is happening its not profitable for a company to do that, so they dont.
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:32:05
Are you using the worst bank in the world?
@_date: 2014-05-22 03:00:57
If Bitcoin reaches 10k it still wouldn't hold a majority share in the global economy.
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:20:44
Except they don't do that, they come to this subreddit and often point out the stupid things people here say.
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:07:36
No, but Gates and Buffets billion are probably pretty invested at all times, i'd imagine they both have less than 40 million spending money available its all invested.
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:55:26
@_date: 2014-07-25 14:39:34
Yes actually.
@_date: 2014-04-09 03:15:54
How is the Bitcoin valuation more stable and reliable? 
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:15:45
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:06:28
But... Im not kidding.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:14:26
What boy
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:24:04
It isn't a whole lot of work to do it with BTC?
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:48:59
You have $400,000 dollars to gamble, makes me assume you are wealthy. And you think this would work or is even a good idea?
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:09:38
How is telling the truth being a dick?
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:14:30
How is it good enough? Where is the marker $10?
@_date: 2014-06-18 05:23:11
The fees can be very significant ($30 is the fee) and both buyer and sender pay transaction fees?
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:38:56
You would've lost $1 that could've gone into something better.
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:12:11
That's it?
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:18:49
14, 7 Bitcoins. Try harder.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:20:56
What? How is that similar at all?
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:11:21
Or Saw Pawlu or Saint Paul.
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:58:37
There are tons of calculators for this...
@_date: 2014-05-29 23:32:11
Btw people that are down voting you just hate on doge.
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:34:24
Mid cap stocks still have room for growth...
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:20:48
I was commenting on how millions is nothing to a bit corp.
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:17:04
Wait wut... You are saying that Bitcoin reduces scams?
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:27:07
Yeah... 20% is a fucking ton.
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:02:41
Ah, not everybody believes that though? Ever wonder why the libs never fucking win any votes?
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:52:30
Are you trying to sound like a asshole?
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:36:36
Which is why you open separate accounts, the government guarantees you up to 100k.
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:53:53
Because its funny. I doubt any 'social media team' noticed. People just post shit and down vote the retards who think this means anything.
@_date: 2014-06-03 13:32:25
So you are saying there is no medium? Jesus christ basic income is retarded.
@_date: 2014-04-09 02:31:42
How is it 'rich' people, $1800 is not that much money.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:06:44
I hope you never get money :P
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:36:43
Fucking beggar, go get a job.
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:35:23
As I stated in another one of the comments I made to you. If I remember correctly, Humble Bundle does that to give people the feeling of control, in reality humble pays a bulk price for the codes, pays themselves and then gives the rest to charity.
@_date: 2014-07-11 12:29:53
^ Exactly
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:41:11
Yes... A currency has a Market Cap.
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:14:52
You are seriously comparing standard oil to AT&amp;T plus isn't standard oil the libertarians dream.
@_date: 2014-05-07 20:53:27

To make income there doesn't have to be a employer or client.
@_date: 2014-06-03 13:38:17
Exactly I hate seeing those things, its also the 1% fallacy, if only I can get 1% of the market share then we'd be rich! Well its fucking hard to get 1%.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:19:35
Except Bitcoin is nowhere near as revolutionary. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:43:47
Because you are stupid. You blame the government for things that aren't the governments fault. There is a lot of shit you can blame the government for. This is not one of them.
@_date: 2014-05-15 18:54:01
The inflationary spiral you are saying would occur is larger than what % of inflation we currently expirence. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:16:52
Ah the 1% fallacy!
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:13:16
Lol? What you are saying bitcoin will have an consistent 63% yby return?
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:12:54
I don't like it because it doesn't show current value.
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:42:29
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:50:53
Why is that? I've made ROI on mine.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:17:26
See yah, in a year your valueless bitcoins!
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:42:24
Much more relevant? Sure the US is more relevant but it still is a significant factor. And your final statement is just stupid.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:59:36
Except most experts agree Cuba is the most communist place in the world.
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:05:15
Bitcoin could be stopped at this stage.
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:58:42
Isn't that a libertarians dream?
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:16:53

Deflation is when the purchasing value of something actually increases and the general level of prices in a economy decreases. Deflation increases the real value of money, the currency of a national or regional economy. This allows one to buy more goods with the same amount of money over time. Economists generally believe that deflation is a problem in a modern economy because it increases the real value of debt, and may aggravate recessions and lead to a deflationary spiral. Although in the past deflation has done some good on a few occasions. Also, a deflationary spiral is a situation where decreases in price lead to lower production, which in turn leads to lower wages and demand, which leads to further decreases in price. Since reductions in general price level are called deflation, a deflationary spiral is when reductions in price lead to a vicious circle, where a problem exacerbates its own cause. The Great Depression was regarded by some as a deflationary spiral. A deflationary spiral is the modern macroeconomic version of the general glut controversy of the 19th century. Another related idea is Irving Fisher's theory that excess debt can cause a continuing deflation. Whether deflationary spirals can actually occur is controversial, with its possibility being disputed by freshwater economists (including the Chicago school of economics) and Austrian School economists.
