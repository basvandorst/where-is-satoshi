I am the same way. I won't tell friends or family what, if anything, I'm holding, because it is a security risk. You're never going to see me driving around in a Lambo, that's for damn sure. Why make yourself a target? What gets me is those Bitcoin billionaires like the Winkelvoss twins and that Danish Bitcoin proponent who proudly announce their large stake in Bitcoin. I don't care how good your security detail is—having that kind of info out there is *dangerous*. Besides, do these guys not realise that ransom is a thing? We've already seen Bitcoin used for ransoms with the WannaCry hack, so I don't think it's a stretch to imagine real-world ransoms occurring.

Well, I got that much. But that's about as dumb as saying, "Why didn't you play these six numbers in the lottery? It was just *that* easy."
The fact is that 99.9% of people hadn't even *heard* about Bitcoin in 2010, let alone invest in it. Hindsight is 20/20. Can you imagine putting *real* money into an *untested* medium of exchange? Can you then imagine it gaining value a million times over? I can see its value now and still find it hard to believe.
Also, Bitcoin stock is not a thing. Unless you mean Bitcoin futures, but that wasn't even a thing until late last year.

I would still argue that it depends. For example, if you have $3 million in the bank and want to buy a $500,000 house, why would you take a loan on the house?
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:50:50
Not necessarily. There have been studies done that indicate that some people are better off renting and then buying outright at a later stage. I'm not insinuation that this is always the case, of course; rather, I'm just saying that it isn't always the case. For example, an investor with more capital can amass wealth more quickly if they aren't also paying off a mortgage; likewise, a freelancer or company owner investing in their own career could end up better by holding off on a mortgage completely (in some cases), and then just paying for the house outright once they've accumulated enough savings.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:22:40
[It's an all-time high!](
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:22:46
Well, I was trying to give a hypothetical. What about an unemployed person who wins $3 million in the lottery? They might not even be able to secure a loan in the first place despite their capital.
Besides, as an investor yourself (I assume), your portfolio might be more aggressive. I think what you're suggesting, though, is to simply open up more lines of credit. I'm not opposed to the idea, but I really don't like being in debt if I can help it. It's just a principle I try to follow as much as possible.
Investment styles aside, what do you think about the idea of Bitcoin futures? Would the benefits really just be to simplify as well as mitigate the risk of swings? Any ideas?

First of all, please stop conflating salary with asset holdings; that wasn't at all what I was saying. One of the most enticing things about crypto (especially ones like Dash) is the anonymity and privacy that it allows. Just want to make sure that's clear to you.
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:48:55
I agree. This is bad news. By all means, tell your spouse—but only if she can swear to you to never speak of it to anyone. I don't even tell my parents. If you need a contingency in case of death or personal emergency, make sure your lawyer is informed.

I still maintain that nobody should say what they hold. If it's $100 or $100,000,000, it doesn't matter. If everyone had a no-tell policy, then we would all be much better off, I think. I don't go blurting around my bank balance, and neither should any sensible person do the same for their crypto holdings.
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:33:23
To be honest, you gain literally nothing by telling people your holdings; you are just adding—however slight—a level of unnecessary risk. I think the only person you should tell, if anyone, is your lawyer. Perhaps a person could create a will that has the keys stored in such a way that they can only be accessed once the death certificate has been notarized, for example.

My solution would be to have the payment device only work with a specific BTC address. There could be some kind of security protocol that prevents anyone except the owner changing it; this would also be effective against rogue customers that might try to alter the BTC address.

You mentioned how workers should talk about what they make to each other (which is fine), but this shouldn't be lumped in with actual assets. I mentioned I'm a freelancer solely because I don't have any colleagues to wag my dick against/make sure we're not getting screwed. By not telling friends and family, you're simply minimizing your risk exposure as well as making sure I'm not seen as a cash cow or anything like that. Most importantly, it's none of their business! Haha.

Actually, I'm Australian, and the taboo of talking about money is more of a British thing, generally speaking. I'm also a freelancer who earns about US$250 per hour, but I will only say that if I'm pressed on it. The funny thing is that I'm sure most people in my life who don't know what I earn probably think I barely scrape by, but obviously that's not the case. By the way, most of those 'publicly rich people' have security details and/or are mostly insulated from crime by living in gated communities.
@_date: 2018-03-11 11:19:45
Doesn't matter. Like I always say, it doesn't matter if you're holding $100 or $100 million. Don't tell anyone how much you're holding.

Well, it's the loss of efficiency, I guess. If you have a rig that will net you just as much from mining as it would if you sold off the power and bought up crypto from the exchange, then I agree that personal mining is a good option.

Many of these systems had a fluid transfer. The cessation of the gold standard is just one; the decimalization of Australian currency is another.

Gold is a metal. Gold can also by synthesized; it just so happens, though, that it costs more to synthesize than it does to mine. If that balance changes, its utility as a currency will lose relevance. Crypto, on the other hand, is mathematically immutable—at least until a point where we have quantum computing or something that is able to crack large primes with incredible ease, at which point the rules would need to be modified accordingly.
