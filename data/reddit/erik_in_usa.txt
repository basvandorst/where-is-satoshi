Right now from Android's Bitcoin Wallet to Exodus.  Had to extract from backup of wallet. 
But, also need to do same from Bitcoin Core, and only thing I know how to get right now is a private key from an address.  Is any one of these private keys enough to create a new wallet?
I also may create in other clients going forward.  
The seed as words is 12 words ranging from 4 to 6 characters each.  Is this what you refer to as the "recovery phrase"?

Thanks for answering.  :)
I've transferred BTC countless times over the years.  That's not the goal here. 
One goal, though not the primary goal, is to understand how wallets create and use private keys and seeds.  Part of what I'm planning to do is create an API for secure BTC transacting that doesn't store private keys. 
Feel free to get very technical or link to useful info.  I need the details to reconstruct a wallet with minimal information for transacting. 
Here is one theoretical use case:  If you could insanely protect the minimal info (recovery phrase or other) and pass it to an API securely, you could construct a wallet on the fly in memory, transact, then destroy the memory and the copy of the private key provided to the API.  Is this correct?

OK, I understand it a lot better now.  I'm a fan of BIP32 and BIP39 now.  :)
This leaves me with questions about Bitcoin Core.  Note that my wallet goes back to 2012.  As I understand it, it won't support BIP32 even if using the latest 0.15.x as that would only apply to new wallets created since 0.13.  
Does that mean I have to find the addresses that have a balance?  
I tried checking the balance of the addresses I previously received funds from, and blockchain.info shows 0 for all of them.  
I did a dumpwallet and it gives me over 1000 keys and addresses!!!  How do I find the addresses with balances without manually copying every one into blockchain.info?
I am going on the assumption that as I spent BTC, change went into other addresses that are not listed in the transactions tab (bitcoin-qt).  That is the only explanation I have for why none of my incoming addresses have addresses, yet my total balance is correct. So, somewhere buried in the 1000+ addresses are pieces of my balance. And the private keys for those addresses are what I need to copy to a new wallet.  Is this assumption correct?
