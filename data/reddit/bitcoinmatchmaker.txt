"A decentralized ledger currency system with a mathematically predictable supply inflation that doesn't lend itself to being controlled by central planners" is ideally suited to systematically destabilize centralized currency systems around the world that are subject to market inflation and arbitrary controls.
"Give me control of a nations money supply, and I care not who makes it’s laws" -Amschel Rothchild's famous quote.
While it could be argued that Bitcoin is a currency sent to take back the influence and control central bankers have appropriated in nations around the world, it's emergence begs the question: If global politicians and dictators, who have deferred to the bankers for years are freed from doing so, to whom will they defer?

No, no.  QR codes printed on coats; entirely different.  When the tattoos on the human worker thing catches on, that'll be creepy.

If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen + 
once bitten, twice shy x 
everybody = 
declining difficulty.

The protocol is designed to slow s down.
The market will decide the proportion that comes out of the transaction fees vs. the miners.

I had taken a look at bctip.org and it looks reasonably workable, especially to motivate newbies.  The "tips" expire and are returned if not redeemed, and their current stats show just less than a 30% uptake.  Another issue for Canadians is no CDN$ as yet.  Just USD, EUR and GBP.
The other side of the equation is the waitstaff who wants to promote their willingness to ACCEPT tips in BTC.  A quality QR code sticker, or card could be used by waitstaff (or a busker, or even a panhandler!) to declare themselves a Bitcoiner to strangers.
Quick search for a QR code generator let me know I'm not the first with that idea either, lol.

BitcoinMeet has a place on that list.

"Bitcoin will do to the Central Bankers what Copernicus did to the Cardinals"

On second thought, individual waitstaff need QR code key fobs.  Discreet and private.
Sturdy vinyl stickers for guitar cases and amps for buskers and entertainers!
Any good commercial links for small-order, cheap-ship suppliers?

Satoshi's identity, by the very nature of the block-chain's public record will eventually be revealed in the movement of Bitcoin from the specific genesis and early block horde.
The longer this takes to reveal, the bigger the actor.
First there were Bitcoin miners.  Data miners aren't far behind if there is money to be made.  I figure that is a likely scenario.

Build it, and they will come.
Focus on Bitcoin gambling or porn if you want sheer numbers.
Focus on Bitcoin libertarianism or philosophy if you want believers.
Focus on Bitcoin vending or micro-payments if you want investors.
Focus on Bitcoin conspiracy or dark-web if you want press.
Focus on Bitcoin crowd-sourcing or causes if you want change.

Isn't this exactly the predictable result of the arms race in mining? The heavy equipment rolls in and nobody can just pan in the creek anymore.
People wait for equipment while watching the difficulty run up the death-curve.
During any "gold-rush" more money is made by the outfits selling the picks, shovels and pans, than the prospectors themselves.
I bet there is already a lucrative, yet unethical business model employed by rig manufacturers to produce flaming rigs and delay their shipment while briefly mining with the cutting edge equipment. In one step they would achieve a couple of things. They would acquire bitcoin on a "first, with the most firepower" basis. They would also drive up difficulty - both accelerating the obsolescence of the "sold" equipment while cultivating demand for more powerful "new" equipment. Rinse. Repeat.

BTCGuild is now 45% of the entire network hashrate. 6% more and they're capable of a 51% attack.  The assumption here is that BTCGuild doesn't also control 45% of the "unknown"; and already has the network.

The longer that horde of Bitcoin isn't spent, the more it indicates a Satoshi that doesn't need the coin; a large syndicate or state actor for example.
You are assuming that data miners will forever be unable to unmix the product of mixing services.  The decoding of the block-chain is a similar proposition to the sequencing and analysis of human DNA in that while not complete, modern technology continually advances in the completion of the picture.

If it was a charity program, maybe GPS the coats.
Then would come the viral "contributing hobo videos", local hobos in their celebrity offering a counter-example to negative stereotype of the aggressive beggar or threatening squeegee kid.
And cleaner streets. And tidier flowerbeds.

I asked.  They blew me off.  Said they were "monitoring" it.  I asked if they'd alert me if/when they'd accept Bitcoin.  Silence.

A reasoned reply.
Though for the sake of argument; I have "reason to assume it was some reason other than those explicitly stated in the early discussions", if only because it seems so unlikely that a "project" so revolutionary to global financial norms could be conceived, developed and promoted anonymously in this big-brother world.  The fact that nobody has outed Satoshi, (including Satoshi) seems such an impossibility.

What if charities gave QR code parkas/hoodies to the homeless/unemployed and asked them to collect litter or weed public flower-beds, and the public could scan the code on their back to donate Bitcoin directly to the individuals doing the work?  Or maybe to support that Satoshi Forest or like-minded endeavours.

I know GoDaddy's huge.  I had heard that a Canadian "Gyft.ca" had emerged recently, but now appears shut-down and "parked".  I wondered if the Canadian entity was regrouping, or whether "Gyft.com" had exercised some legal or economic imperialism.
Either way, was curious.
Solid link bank, btw.
