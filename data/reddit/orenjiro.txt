Thanks for the tip. I'll use it in the future. We went to a fairly public place with lots of traffic so I thought I was relatively safe.

No. He's saying he paid sixty five dollars and two cents for two bitcoins

Are you me? Lol. No seriously.. hating myself right now. Back in '09-'10 when it was fresh and new I thought it was a cool concept and had a really (at the time) demon of a rig. But, being 18 and fresh in college, couldn't be bothered to learn about it and take the time to mine.

Hold. Why? Because you got nothing to lose and it will (however incredibly small) help bitcoin in the long run

Faulty PSU. Happened to me before. Capacitor blew and it sounded like a gunshot. Scared the living shit out of me. PSU is probably the LAST thing you want to cheap out on, mate. All your equipment could've fried.
Find yourself a decent PSU by Corsair, Antec, Seasonic.

Yeah, what's worse is that it was essentially free. =(

Anyone that's been on Reddit knows that 3 years on the net feels like thousands of years. Lol.

From what I understand, and I may be wrong, you can sell say.. 0.1 BC at 1 dollar and it'll show as $10 per bitcoin. Do this enough times and other people will go "Hey the price is going DOWN! Sell sell sell before it crashes!". They empty their wallet (or a nice chunk). Spread this to a bunch of people selling and the price drops.

No he didn't. There were only 2 people with reviews near me (Toronto). One didnt respond back and the other is charging +$100 current market worth. I figured, since the boom, a lot of people are looking to dump their coins
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:08:08
It's under 100 now!

These things can go both ways. I could've taken his coins and ran away and vice versa. Usually when I buy things off kijiji or craigslist, the seller wants to count the money to see if its all there and then the transaction proceeds.

Yup, alot of the high quality PSUs are rebranded from Seasonic OEM. If you want to save money do some research! =)
