A facebook shitcoin would be like the venezuelan petrodollar. Centralized, under data zuckerbergs control, it just would be an inhencement for the stasis of 21 century. Hint in from germany

Why do you want to know this? It would be an irrelevant information. See it like this: we have now 2-3 millions shipwrecks on the ground at the oceans. Ok but that is simply no reason to give up on ships like you see. Same with other technologies like airplanes, cars, and more.

Companies of course can say „we dont accept your bitcoin“ for their goods and services. But they are free to accept your car or diamonds or bitcoin. They have to accept euros, that is the only law.
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:19:10
Bitcoin has already won the race. The situation is that only a few people understand. The bitcoin-technology surpasses by far.  Many cant or wont believe this. In the evolution of money - people are like brainwashed. I wouldnt say they are stupid  but so used to fiat-money, they never thought about the concept of money and what flaws it have. We live in revolutionaire times. This will take 2 or 3 decades. Our grandchildren will find it funny that our generation payed with funny coloured piece of papers.

If you ban cryptos than ban private car selling, art painting or expensive wine, everything like diamonds or gold  or anything else. In germany in our constiturion there is a free market guaranteed. Its called „vertragsfreiheit“, so here it would be illegal to ban bitcoin.

I think too his question aims how many different coins you can have on a ledger. So its a valid question because my experience leds me to 3-4, what is not many. Hello ledger? Are you there?
@_date: 2018-11-06 14:22:18
Im german and i used fidor in combination with bitcoin.de. Fidor is under full banking-regulation, so you have a kyc-process to open an account. Same with bitcoin.de. I can recommend it sofar, but i havent used their service for nearly 2 years.

Europe here. When you see what Italy‘s Populists are planning right now... that makes our greece-crisis look like a sweet little pussycat-problem. Beneath brexit-bullshit and other things the euro will inflate or even vanish, because a lot of the people want to step back to a national currency. The US money printers run at full throttle and Yellen said „we dont edit the fed“. The next worldwide economy collapse ist just a question of time and it will be desastrous. Gold is working as a store of value since thousands of years and yes i would hold some bitcoin to hedge the upcoming desaster. Good luck to us all.

Here is my solution, tell me what you think. First i used truecrypt to make an encrpyted file with a strong password. In that file are my seeds and more information etc.. I sent this file to my e-mail-account so i´m the only one with access to that file. But i also use the inactive account manager setting so my beneficiary will have access to the encrypted file. I shared the password before, so my beneficiary can decrypt, but during my lifetime they will never have access to the file. What do you think?

Intrinsic value means something you can use to survive without anybody else. Gold for example has no intrinsic value, like bitcoin. Water has intrinic value, things you can eat, drink or even breathe.
