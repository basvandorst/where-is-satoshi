Thanks! I bet this will buy me several Teslas in AD2048 (since I will be unlikely to be very much alive in AD2101)

That is a true statement, just missing quotation marks. like if i said: thatotherbitcoinaddress is "correct horse battery staple."

I almost tried to get them to accept bitcoin Saturday, but I really didn't want any girl scout cookies. We ended up getting some once we got some of those green pieces of paper with the dead presidents on them. They just aren't the same nowadays. I guess they are designed for a younger audience. Or perhaps my tastebuds are just altered from excessive vaping.

How is that not useful? it rakes him in a ton of btc at the expense of anyone intelligent enough to invest there.

hmm. i read this as: why it is foolish not to use bitcoin.
1. Price drops are typically just stolen coins being dumped at every exchange simultaneously. 
2. Mining is becoming less profitable because of greed: the big rush to dump mining equipment to tons of prospective miners; Thieves, dumping their stolen coins. 
3. Plenty of protection for Sellers (no refunds, without permission) Also, don't trust your bitcoins with people you wouldn't trust anything else with. scammers gonna scam. Proper coin storage, encryption, and not giving it to the wrong person are key to not losing your coins. it's not like all Dollars are protected from theft, fraud, or loss. I have never had a bank give me my money back after somebody used my card. I've lost about $10,000 to banks. I've also lost a few hundred paper dollars due to not being able to make a backup of my real wallet, which also contained s.s. card, IDs and credit cards.
4. Sellers would benefit from the lower fees and no chargebacks, but this is one of those scenarios where you can lead a horse to water, but can't make them drink.
5. point  was just plain retarded.

convert bitcoin to paper wallets,  stuff paper wallets in ladies' pants, ???, Profit.

once those get sold to the highest bidder and liquidated by the winner,  it is time to buy up all the cheap bitcoin and watch your bitcoin holdings multiply in value.

it will probably hit 647 while he's using it, and then start falling if he does it long enough

From what I've seen: People who don't have bitcoin but know a little about it think it is dying, but IF it could hit $1 they would buy a few thousand. Or they would not, and would be back to square 1, not owning bitcoin and being amazed by the seemingly high prices. From my point of view: 1 bitcoin is worth well over 9000 little green pieces of paper, and that number is growing every day they print more. the markets just haven't caught up yet, because there are still multitudes of people who have never heard of bitcoin, and too many of the people who have either think it is a get-rich-quick, ponzi, fad, or have just drank too much of their country's kool-aid, and think the stock markets going down aren't teally just the organized stealing of millions of people's money- ie: a quick and dirty 'fundraiser' for a particular group or entity.(like some kind of reverse-Robinhood)

sell the phone on ebay for bitcoin recovery,  like other people sell junk for gold recovery. then buy new bitcoin with the proceeds
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:50:16
I have 200 bits. idk how to touch it though. it is supposed to buy me 2 Tesla cars in A.D. 2101. I also have 0.001 btc from playing coin flapper and coin crusher

I found it amusing because that was one of my grandfather's comments about bitcoin when I was trying to explain it to him. "But can you Eat them?" "I guess a person could eat gold, If they got hungry enough... " which reminded me of that rucka song "I could eat money with hot sauce,  especially if it's fried."

dollar bills are made from the bowels of swine.

it would be a mix of Share/give,  Spend, Hold, and also doing something productive with it, which fits in the Share/give because it would be sort of like (which I just bought some bitcoin to participate in)
