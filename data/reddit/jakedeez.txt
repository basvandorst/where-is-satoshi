If you can get cash in NY with your debit card look up coin_trader on local Bitcoin...

As zero settlement times, the trade is the settlement.

Until there is a viable derivatives market for bitcoin, I think this is a terrible idea.  You're getting return free risk... you can't make any money, but if the company holding the "value" stable runs out of bitcoin then your SOL.  Seems like a bad bet to me, if you want fiat value, own fiat.

Going to be an awesome conference.

You guys should do some research before rushing to judged.  Chad Cascarilla, their CEO, owned like 15-20% of the entire mining network at one point.  He was CPU mining with computers at his hedge fund at night.  He is one of the older bitcoiners out there. itBit isn't a "bunch of rich guys" - it's a bunch of fucking ballers that keep their heads down.  You know, because, they're really ballers.  
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:19:26
It's not fake trades, itBit caters more to professional/institutional traders then retail.  As such, their volume is often quite lumpy.

I don't have a problem doing this.  I'm Jake - the CFO, and we'd need some of the tech guys involved too, so I'll have to try and schedule it.  But hey, we're Factom, we're all about transparency, so I'm sure the team will be down for an AMA.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:17:52
It doesn't have to mean that.  It could be a Factom entry, or private blockchains.  
@_date: 2016-01-01 19:33:00
Yes, shares of chain, as part of Nasdaq private markets.

Reevaluate? 
I kid, I kid.
Bitpay is the goto.

That's me.
I was on a different computer a minute ago, now my phone.  Think that's why it's a different name?  Weird.

The answer is custody.  The buy side typically doesn't custody any of their own assets. Funds are hesitant to invest in btc given how hard it is to securely custody them.

You might want to consider becoming a prepper, if you're not.  It will probably make you feel better, since you're bonkers.  :)
@_date: 2016-02-02 20:35:48
Earth shattering, and probably totally ignored.
@_date: 2016-02-07 22:35:14
Nope, if you do, the blockstream guys might beat you up.
@_date: 2016-02-10 22:37:52
Nope, the killer app for bitcoin right now is raising VC money.
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:31:08
A 51% attack.

Relax guy, I was kidding.  Just trying to lighten the mood.  And, yes, actually, I know Austin alright, and a few of the other guys there.

Sending PayPal is a defense against a double spend.  It's you guys accepting PayPal for Bitcoin that are at risk of losing money.

Ha!  Check with DAH - Blyth seems willing to buy anything.

Rather then be reactionary - read the story.  It's thought provoking.

I'm one of the founders of Lazzerbee.  DM me if you want to discuss paper wallets.  :). 
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:37:21
No worries.  
And think maybe yes, you are just a bit on edge.
Maybe take a 240 break.  ;)

Ha! I remember giving Matt Miller that paper wallet, and I remember txting him when they flashed the QR on TV telling him the BTC was going to be taken.  He didn't believe it would happen... Only took about a minute.

Bitcoin as a currency is a use case of bitcoin, and inter a use case for blockchain.  Ipso Facto Blockchain is the breakthrough. Bitcoin is a result of the breakthrough.

It's not an emergency meeting, it's an expedited meeting.  Probably so people can make it home for thanksgiving...

Golds use case is not replaced by gold.  Several of golds use cases are shared by Bitcoin... But, certainly not replaced.  Gold has use cases that Bitcoin can't replace though, as mentioned by others, jewelry.  Also there are industrial uses for gold that Bitcoin doesn't help with.  Bitcoin likewise has use cases that gold doesn't... 
The store of value use case is similar.  So is the non-fiat currency use case.  Phisical gold is however still better for anonymous payments and transfers, as well as hiding assets. 
The demand for gold could be somewhat diminished by Bitcoin, however I would suggest that it is only marginally the case.

Probably just expedited so they can start heading out of town for thanksgiving.

Good to see Factom using mutually beneficial relationship to further efforts in the space!

If you want to custody bitcoins, outside of a coldwallet or Blockchain.info wallet - Gemeni or itBit have trust charters and insurance.  That way you'll be made whole even with a mass hack.
