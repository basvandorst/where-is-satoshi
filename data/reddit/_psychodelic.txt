what do yall have??
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:46:29
to me it still sound midlevel af. i mean gold was valuable because of its scarcity right? and what? you have an unlimited supply of cash now? yet peoples earning are still getting stolen and more than likely unrefunded? i had 500 dollars stollen from a family member (the atm allows in usa. plus all he had to do was get my card) yet i wasnt allowed the funds back? fuck that. when the system isn't as weak ill feel more secure. we need some geniuses thinking about this.

I didnt discover it early enough. When I did find it I invested a lot immediately and made profit and still invest with every paycheck. Bitcoin at the very least is a good back up plan. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:48:08
Got this too. I have no problem with bitpay really. I mean they're the best for what they do and until someone better comes along I'm gonna keep using them

Just download cashapp and go to buy bitcoin. Easy peasy.

Yeah I bought some stuff from my sister for bitcoin and sometimes give my sibling bitcoin to do my chores.

Yeah but we've been thinking about moving in with each other for awhile now. Most of my money is stored in bitcoin. I dont care what the price looks like tbh at this point the goal has become to just get as much bitcoin as I can. If its cheaper that's even better 
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:17:07
I mean I'm using bitpay just because no one in my area accepts bitcoin. I still do my part though. If they accepted bitcoin then I'd use that. I'd even pay more for something just to be able to use bitcoin

Can someone who's better at math convert that to USD?
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:00:54
That's beautiful 
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:47:03
i mean technically 1 Bitcoin is already worth more than 1 USD

Get the app in your app store called cashapp. Buy bitcoin on there and send it to your own wallet. Gotta use your ID to withdrawal

I'm late to this sub but fiat currency is trash every since they took it off the gold standard. Now it it only worth the paper its printed on. This is true but it hasn't been completely realized yet. There is nothing backing up fiat currency except the trust and faith of the goverment. Which in turn the only thing backing up bitcoin is mathematics, philosophy, and the trust and faith of the people.

@_date: 2019-05-06 01:28:30
Honestly if you're just keeping a small amount of bitcoin (.01) or something like that you should be completely fine holding it on there. You should know that if you lose your phone and get another phone and redownload the app it creates you a new account so you'll need to back it up somehow. They have a recovery setting. If you dont want to write down a long code you could go to bitaddress.com and make a new cold wallet. You could print out the paper 4 or 5 times and keep copies everywhere if you want. I laminated mine. But if you dont wanna do all that just keep it on the cashapp until you're comfortable moving it. It's your currency so you have the freedom to do with it as you please
@_date: 2019-05-08 04:10:47
I didnt know that. I've very new to LN so I'm still learning how it works. I just now have gotten to where I have a decent understanding of bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:11:30
Ugh 2500 dollars for a bitcoin and I'll be able to buy a whole one :)
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:28:50
Yeah I refresh my wallet regularly and reboot it
@_date: 2019-05-08 03:35:40
I used blue wallet. I tried elliciar first but honestly 
 it was too complex right now for someone who is non tech savvy. Blue wallet was very simple. It did take 10 hours for my bitcoin to get confirmed to the wallet, then 30 minutes for it to be converted to lightening. A plus is my gf thought it was aesthetic. "This is the nicest looking one you've put on my phone so far"
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:32:22
I'm not going to keep a lot on there. Just casual use.

From what I've gathered from downloading it today is that you can transfer it to a segwits wallet then go to the LN wallet and transfer it from there. 
From LN wallet click manage funds, then click the segwits wallet, then amount and done.
Edit: hope that's what you were asking
