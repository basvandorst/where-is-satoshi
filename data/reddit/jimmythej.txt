Posts related to price always get to the top no matter how stupid.

I doubt it, but that is a popular futurist belief that greatly understates how little we know about the complexities of the human body and brain.

Isn't Bitcoin generation an aSymptote and thus won't actually ever hit 21 million. Or does it just round up from that tiny fraction near the end
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:30:36
Well precious metals prices are incredibly manipulated. Theoretically if that manipulation disappeared you'd probably see somewhere in the range of 5-50x increase in the price of gold/silver.
Also, 10 years is a very long time for such things. Just sitting there holding onto coins for 10 years doesn't really do anything to help the system.

Maybe if Netflix started accepting BTC and promoting it on it's site ? Might be a pretty good way to get it out there.
@_date: 2014-12-13 04:24:15
I don't think any proof of work coin can be more useful than BTC because of the network effect. Alternative methods like Proof of Stake could be enough better to warrant looking at.

Eligius is 0% and also does this and also doesn't require signing up.
@_date: 2014-12-13 08:52:08
More like next 25 years. Seems unlikely Bitcoin will be dominant by then. Black Swan events and all. Who knows but I doubt Bitcoin will be  crypto by then.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:24:19
Wouldn't eligius work for you then ? They are large enough that variance shouldn't really be a problem and they are 0% fees.
I have no idea why you would care that the operator of eligius is a religious fanatic also.

That's not true. The definition is this from Google:
* "the forming of a theory or conjecture without firm evidence"
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:33:37
All tehcnically true, but Bitcoin's main advantage is as a payment system, not a currency. So in this regard it is doing it's job perfectly as it is facilitating commerce that might not be conducted without it. It can increase the scope of a business' customer base and empower individuals to bypass things like credit-card/paypal's region locking and western union's absurb fees.

Virtex's volume really isn't very high though. I think this is a threat to them. I know as a virtex user myself this will likely make me cross-over.

I'm not actually saying Ripple is good. I don't disagree with you. It's just people are rarely vehemently logical and rational. People want a system that 1: is easy to use, 2: more convenient then their current system. Never mind that Ripple could be taken over super easy and controlled, Plebs don't care about that stuff, they say they do, but then their actions tell a different story. I personally don't believe in Ripple and am not a big fan, but I do think it's a slight improvement over all the centralized established systems we currently have... and for a lot of people, this is enough.
Edit: Also the comment that Ripple is killing the bitcoin price could be true (I don't know if it actually is). It's not because Ripple is better, if people are selling Bitcoin and buying Ripple, then it's a true statement.
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:42:23
I think that is open to interpretation.
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:59:30
No its not. He said he was worried about paying bills. Someone with 5 figures in BTC would not be as such.
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:33:50
Well... Ripple is up about 400% this past month. It could totally be people selling BTC to get on the Ripple bandwagon.
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:25:31
Are you arguing that Bitcoin came before metal coins ?
@_date: 2014-12-13 09:01:50
Well I can't predict the future by a long shot but just like Bitcoin is a disruptive force I would expect a new disruptive technology to supplant it by then. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 05:06:37
Well I'm not saying it's ready for the mainstream yet but people are working on improving it. It or some other concept could and almost for sure will supplant Bitcoin at some point.

Couldn't state actors easily influence its price as they have infinite money ?
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:08:09
Probably the government sadly, I mean I don't trust either at all, but at least there is some hope the government will be responsible...
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:56:52
The problem with this thought process for bitcoin is that the number of people who hold massive amounts is going to stay basically the same such that the big players will scale with its growth so that eventually one person could crash the price no matter its total valuation as they will have like  trillion dollars in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:14:36
If the private keys are just UUIDs could be doable, would need an update to actually work with a diff coin though.
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:38:05
Yeah, could use plugins or something. Have a system for making plugins really easily too. Main problem is downloading the blockchain, it would kind of have to be a thin client.
@_date: 2013-10-07 00:22:15
Yeah I wouldn't buy from BFL, that being said I do have a BFL little single munching away. It's already found a block in fact!
@_date: 2013-03-11 04:19:41
For now this is entirely accurate.
@_date: 2013-03-06 10:13:40
The way Bitcoin is designed, it should always increase in value compared to fiat currencies until the end of time (in the long run, obviously there are dips and such). This is because it is deflationary as opposed to inflationary.

Upboat for truth about fats being good and a good explanation, considering one sentence.
@_date: 2013-02-20 09:58:20
They just mean per standard unit, which for silver is 1 oz and for bitcoin is 1.

One, he will most definitely get that much out of these assuming he paid the reduced prices on them. His first month he may make as much as $600.
Two, this is not a constructive comment.
@_date: 2013-08-24 03:46:34
Yes. Hundreds of THash... They just seem to have multiple PHash of preorders. Though I can't say for certain.

I really hope those wires holding up your fans don't break. Could be an expensive situation. Looks good though :)
At 22.69 BTC for those guys that's not terrible too. What are you making on them at the moment ? ~ $20/day after electricity ?
@_date: 2013-03-05 10:58:38
Aye. You can set up a Raspberry Pi or a device with a similarly tiny footprint to run your ASICs, so you aren't wasting a watt of energy on no damn'puter :)

I agree, 66 mil sounds about right.

How would Japan fit into that category... or the UK. They are islands with next to no natural resources left.
@_date: 2013-02-24 16:52:22
Sadly this is all true. I cash out at 1 BTC from my pool to my personal wallets.
@_date: 2013-03-11 03:31:20
Yeah, I'm not sure how many people speculating on bitcoin leverage their money the same way you do with fiat currencies. With Forex markets you have organizations buying/selling billions of a particular currency every day. Bitcoin is barely even worth 1/2 a billion, so it's not going to have the same kind of stability.
@_date: 2013-05-14 16:34:33
@_date: 2013-08-14 01:26:48
What makes you think it will stay at 50% increase a month forever. It's going to slow down (as a percentage) sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2013-03-05 02:32:12
Still speculation though. What if you bought those Bitcoins then it wen't down to $0.5 ? Hard to know the future before it happens ^^ Otherwise everyone would win in Forex markets too.

I think the min tip is 0.01 BTC, not 100% on that though. I think you can give less if you specify USD though. I'm really not sure how it works. I have never tried using it yet.

This has so many levels to it. We must upvote this to infinity.

Your math is beautiful.
@_date: 2013-02-04 11:01:52
The first batch will double the difficulty of bitcoin mining (It will almost exactly double the network hashrate). So the second batch if BFL hasn't shipped yet (they should have though so take this with a grain of salt) would be at $115 USD profit a day assuming $20.5 USD for bitcoin and $0.12/kwatt energy.
@_date: 2013-08-14 00:58:53
BFL has probably shipped over 100THash looking at some of the numbers.
@_date: 2013-03-11 06:20:45
You never know, but since about 50% have wives it doesn't seem like there would be a huge demand for that either you are right.

I think it's just a market sentiment thing. Now that a standard unit of bitcoin is equal to that of a silver dollar it is implied that it should be taken more seriously as a currency. Just a thought though, I don't actually know.
@_date: 2013-02-06 00:37:24
Yeah maybe. According to their new time-tables though everything is apparently going according to plan and they should be shipping out the week after next. We shall see...
I don't think that has been proven, just what bASIC (or w/e they are called now) claims. Not that I would be surprised, I'm just sayin'.
@_date: 2013-03-11 06:30:03
I'm flattered but no thanks. I shall give you upvotes to desist :)

 - You can buy bitcoins here with cash at most of the major canadian banks. Look on their site for the list.
 - Also, you can just buy them in person or through someone with this.

Unless he is somewhere where energy costs are over 33cents/kWatt it is still profitable.

Move to slush pool my friends. They have good service and their fees are only 2% (as opposed to 5% at BTC Guild)
Bitminter looks good too.
