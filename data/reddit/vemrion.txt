While bitcoins may be scarce, and block space may be scarce, cryptocurrencies are not.
Why wouldn't I just use litecoin if bitcoin devs are intent on creating artificial scarcity by deliberately making the protocol less efficient than in could be?
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:45:29
This is how consensus happens, folks. I'm feeling much better about this debate now.
If we end up with a change that:
1. protects miners from big block increases, 
2. avoids a repeat of this debate every 18 months, and 
3. ensures that bitcoin has room to grow...
Then this is a win-win-win to me. I think it really is simpler than we are making it. The protocol already has a way to increase the difficulty automatically; it seems kinda silly not have the same thing for block size (with similar protections against huge increases).

Speaking of PR.... That sound great on paper, but I'd like to see the system up and running first. In my experience, claims of amazing efficiency often fail to live up to the hype. Plus, that's only *one* Layer 2 protocol -- there could be many more. Not all of them will even by related to finance. 
Add in increased transaction size because of multisig and the possibility of IoT bringing another order of magnitude of transactions and it's clear we'll end up needing a lot of space (hopefully not all of it).
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:06:59
Yeah, I heard they [need bigger blocks](
I bet there will be several competing Layer 2 services: StrawPay, LN, plus that new one from today. That's gonna put more and more pressure on block size unless one of them emerges triumphant. They could all find niches to serve and coexist. I'm excited about these emerging protocols, but it's too early to pick a winner.

I'm not invested in litecoin, for the record, but my point was that your artificial scarcity plan is full of holes. Right now bitcoin is on top, but it if becomes known as "that payment network that's really expensive to use" then people will look for alternatives, whether it's litecoin or BBQCoin or whatever. 
Trying to enforce transaction scarcity on open source payment gateways is like trying to control the market of lizard-related reddit nicknames. By the way, that's a nice 1-hour old account you've got there.

So if 95% of miners are publishing pop songs, then I guess the 5% would have to find an altcoin that's not obsessed with K-pop. But to Jeff's point, it seems like folks would be able to see this coming a long ways away and migrate before the painful cutoff point. 95% adoption is a pretty high barrier and it's likely statoshi/sipa metrics would be available to all.

Thanks, Rusty. This is a very levelheaded analysis. I'd like to underscore two things you said:

Not directly bitcoin-related but definitely relevant to the larger landscape of payments. A big selling point for bitcoin is increased security by way of encryption. EMV isn't perfect, but it improves credit card technology, but the upgrade process also leaves gaps for bitcoin to advance through. Are any new POS swipers compatible with bitcoin? It would be a great idea for a bitcoin business to make next-gen card readers that are also bitcoin compatible.

Even though this isn't an official announcement (yet), it's pretty clear where the payments industry is headed. In change management terms we could say that the payments industry is "unfrozen" or at least "thawing" to the prospect of change. 
We've been using 1970s technology for many decades now and it's clear that we're at the end of the line for credit cards (I'm thinking of the US here). That leaves us at a crossroads. 
* Do we simply patch up the bleeding wounds with a closed, proprietary fix? Apple Pay is somewhat more secure and has several big players on board. 
* Do we make a major technology upgrade in the form of chip &amp; pin EMV technology that Europe already has? Certainly, that's where the credit cards companies like Visa want to go. 
* But do merchants even need to buy expensive, black-box card-processing units from vendors who have a horrible track record of not only getting hacked, but being ignorant of that fact for months at a time? 
It seems like the time has come for upstarts like Square who can offer a payment solution that does it all, especially since they are using tools like iPads and Nexus tablets that can be upgraded independently of Sqaure's card reader, which is just a dumb reader tied to their software. 
Square is really a software vendor and what technology can be added to their stack with relative simplicity? Bitcoin. All you need is an internet connection and a screen to display QR codes. Boom. Done. Why *wouldn't* you add bitcoin capability, especially when you're competing with vendors who are trying to lock merchants into a single stack that they control. 
Square's value offering is it's inexpensiveness and the myriad choices it can offer to merchants and consumers without diluting their ease of use. The idea of a "cash register" is going to become an anachronism in a few years since most payments will be done digitally with iPads and other tablets. Why buy expensive proprietary solutions that are obsolete in a few months anyway? 
Payments processing is about to be hit by the same wave that hit the GPS Navigation industry and the MP3 Player industry. Why pay for a specialized device when a widely available consumer device can do the same thing just as well and with a lot less cost? And the great thing about general purpose devices is that it's a cinch to add new software that does more. When looked at through this lens, Bitcoin starts to look like a part of the payments space almost by default. It's more secure than a credit card and it doesn't take any additional hardware if you've already got a tablet. For mom &amp; pop shops, it's a slam dunk. 
For big retailers like Walmart, it's not such a sure thing, but they are motivated by high credit card processing fees to create alternative systems. Every fraction of a percent could be the difference between a profitable quarter or a losing one. Once Bitcoin starts being embedded into these systems, even if nobody uses them initially, it will have solved a big part of the chicken &amp; the egg conundrum that confronts users of a new currency.

I'm thinking of them as shares in Reddit (not all shares, just a certain class, and probably no voting rights and legally they can't really call them "shares" but I'm using that term anyway for understandability) that will be administered by the blockchain. Basically each share (aka "Reddit Notes") will be tied to a small chunk of bitcoin, say perhaps 100 bits. Maybe more to enable greater subdivision of shares.
The people who get them will be able to sell/trade/buy more of them. Eventually the market should determine a fair value for them and they could be traded on exchanges. Reddit Notes may not technically be an altcoin, but it sounds like it will trade independently of btc and will have USD backing (maybe?) in the form of the money reddit set aside to back these "shares." Because of that, it may have a more stable value than btc.
Ultimately, this will spread idea of cryptocurrencies far and wide and may serve as a proof of concept for people looking to create decentralized stock markets (like Overstock's Patrick Byrne.)
Not sure if I got everything correct, but the project is still underway and some key implementation decisions have not yet been made. Their lack of transparency is warranted because, legally speaking, I don't think anything quite like this has been done before.

It's no mistake that their Senior Director of Corporate Strategy made this announcement.

I don't think bitcoin really does affect bank revenue *in the short term*. In the long term it utterly disrupts it by allowing people to act as their own bank and transfer money with only a few pennies in fees. The fees for transferring money are a small but steady stream of income for the banks. As others have pointed out, it also undermines the whole idea of central banks, which start to seem outdated in the internet era -- especially when you remember all the corruption associated with banks: Libor, London gold fix, hidden inflation, etc.
We have to remember that bitcoin operates on "internet time" so long term for bitcoin is just a few years away... Meanwhile long term for banks is a couple decades or even longer. At some point those two timelines will intersect and banks probably won't be ready. They would need to modernize their entire infrastructure in just a few years. Ain't gonna happen.

That requires both the UK and SA to have bitcoin brokers like Coinbase. Not really familiar with non-US bitcoin merchants enough to say if those exist. Anybody know?
Also, I gotta say the remittance is a nut that probably won't be cracked until bitcoin is already ubiquitous. It requires:
1. A company that buys/sells bitcoin in Country A
2. A company that buys/sells bitcoin in Country B
3. Person Z needs to know about bitcoin and have a computer/mobile
4. Person Y needs to know about bitcoin and have a computer/mobile
Without all 4 of those being true there cannot be a circle of remittance. Many third world countries barely have running water, let alone the infrastructure needed to support a bitcoin startup. Also, the phones tend to be dumb/feature phones rather than smartphones. [Coinkite is doing good work here]( and may have a breakthrough on their hands, but we've got a ways to go before poorly educated immigrants even understand that it's an option to send bitcoin for remittance purposes. 
Meanwhile, Western Union already has all their infrastructure in place as well as name recognition and a certain amount of trust (and huge fees). Sadly, this is not a fix-once, deploy-everywhere scenario. There are a lot of politics in each receiving country and the sending countries are likely to impose capital controls like NY's BitLicense. I think remittance will probably remain a pipe dream until adoption is already most of the way there. Then, if the currency aspect of bitcoin is strong (e.g. it's accepted by merchants worldwide), then "remittance" becomes moot and we're all just using the de facto global payment system.

This article kind of blows, but the author raises some legitimate points about Amazon's unique position in the marketplace. Amazon already has their finger in a lot of financial pies, like big corps tend to do (GE or Walmart anyone?) and they are sort of part of the Wall Street establishment (new money-style). So this is like asking a bank to adopt bitcoin. It's too soon. Bitcoin isn't ready and neither are they. 
Besides, Amazon has plenty to gain from bitcoin, but only if it becomes widely adopted. If they could pay their vendors and Marketplace suppliers with bitcoin they could save a lot of cash on printing checks and bank fees. But the merchant demand isn't there yet, and that's what is needed for this to move forward. In the meantime Amazon risks much by playing their hand too early. 
I hope they do eventually give the credit card companies a run for their money. With bitcoin combined with their own currency/credit system they could deliver a better experience for customers by giving them flexibility and the chance to save money by using bitcoin or AmazonCoin on purchases. Why not make it easy for customers to buy bitcoin and instantly exchange between btc and AmazonCoin? Then Amazon becomes a hub of financial freedom for customers and drives a stake through the mollycoddled world of credit card companies and their big fees and shitty service.

He's also incredibly ignorant about cash. I would like to see him get a "suitcase of cash" together without arousing suspicion. How does one do that, anyway? If you go to a bank and ask for [a million dollars worth]( in crisp $100 bills, you'll set off every KYC/AML alarm in the house.
Even if they did give it to you, those bills would have serial  that are probably roughly in order and are tracked by the bank (assuming they even have $1 MM in cash on hand, which is ridiculous). It's naive to think those serials aren't scanned by banks, ATMs and other devices. That data is probably fed to the NSA or some other alphabet agency.

It's easy to mock, but if you want to have a serious conversation with an Evangelical you may want to frame the Federal Reserve as Babylon the Great and the fractional reserve debt-based system as the demonic wine that she makes all the nations drink. 
Bitcoin is chump change in comparison to the power of the Empire's system of control. It represents freedom from the Mark of the Beast, not enslavement to it. In the Bible, only those who have the mark can buy or sell, but *anybody* can create a bitcoin wallet with a click of a mouse. It's a end-run around the Antichrist's control grid, as it were. That's why purchasing bitcoin is so difficult for some folks --  the existing financial regime likes to make it difficult so you can't escape their grasp.
I find it's best to one-up these folks. "Wait, you're just being clued into the fact that the End Times are near? Where the heck have you been? The system of iniquity has been in charge for a loooong time..."
Properly educated, religious folks could become valuable allies in the movement. Frame bitcoin as anti-Wall Street, anti-Babylon and pro-freedom and you can start to win them over.

Multibit doesn't connect to the web per se, but it does need to check the bitcoin protocol for an updated version of the blockchain, which requires internet access. 
Basically, you need to connect to the internet to transfer the bitcoins in order to spend them for 2 reasons: 1, to get synced to the bitcoin network, and 2, to broadcast the transaction if you decide to spend some.
The reason people tell you not to connect to the internet is a more general concern -- basically to make sure you don't pick up and viruses, keyloggers or other malware. If your computer hasn't been turned on in a year, you should be fine! Assuming you don't already have a virus. So just open up Multibit and don't open a web browser.
Now, spending the coins is a different question. If you're going to spend them on Overstock, for example, you would need to connect to their site to do so. Just make sure you're actually on Overstock.com and not a phishing site like 0v3rstock.ru or something.

But Marc gives plenty of credit to ApplePay for moving things forward in the short term by pushing consumers closer to being fully-digital and phone-based.

I was just pointing out that the Bitcoin to Wave analogy is far from perfect because there were a lot of differences in the approach. Not trying to say I'm smarter than Wave fanatics, but I definitely never got the feeling about it that I get from bitcoin. Wave's hype was more about marketing from a huge multinational corporation; bitcoin is way more grassroots and open source. Not trying to be a dick, but the analogy just doesn't work for me. None of this guarantees bitcoin will be successful, but if you're looking for analogies to failed protocols, maybe [Gopher]( would be more appropriate.

I wouldn't say well established. M-Pesa and the like are kind of hacks around limitations like infrastructure in general and banking in particular. There's certainly room for a decentralized standard that can underlie the systems for each country. And there also bitcoin is superior as a truly international currency and network. 
It also gives Africa a way to avoid the corrupt banking cartel that has ensnared western politics. In their arrogance they have denied banking to the majority of the African population, but it may be their undoing. African banks, for their part, may be even more openly corrupt and self-serving. Bitcoin, as a technology and a network, is a huge boon to the young underclass, who are soon going to have access to smarter phones.

It's not a true currency... yet. People are investing in it because they see a future where the currency aspect is more robust.

I agree with your comparison of bitcoin to bittorrent, but I really have to question anybody who thought Google Wave was going anywhere. It was slow, over-architected, not open source and actually not even that innovative. I was using Ray Ozzie's Groove software nearly a decade prior and it did a lot of the same things but failed for a lot of the same reasons. 
If Wave wanted to be successful, they should've made it a low-level protocol and let people build client software on top of it. Instead Google tried to keep control over the whole stack and then ended up making something that was destined to die in beta.
Of course, I think Wave is now open, but it's too late because people already have a first impression of crappy bloatware that will be hard to shake. Bitcoin seems like it will avoid a lot of these pitfalls simply because Satoshi failed at making a complete in-stack ecosystem and simply released the core protocol and let the broader community do their thing. It's better to do one thing really well than to try to mash all these different services together into a closed platform, which is what Wave did.

This would be tantamount to saying "We are complete idiots who suck at our jobs!" -- the backbone of major news orgs are their editors. Editors decide if a story is published, not writers. 
Whenever you see a story with an "anonymous source" that doesn't mean that only the writer knows the source. Usually, in confidence, the editor is told as well and uses that as part of their judgment. 
Now it's true Newsweek hasn't had dedicated fact checkers since the 90s, but they still have editors and the Editor in Chief ultimately has to take responsibility for what appears in the magazine -- and especially what appears on the cover. Blame Leah for her journalism, yes, but don't forget that every fact, assertion and source was reviewed, poked and prodded by editors. And if it wasn't, then they are in dereliction of their duty and Newsweek is basically a blog (this might be the case, actually). By publishing the story, the editors put their stamp of approval on it and their asses on the line.
TL;DR: Don't let the Newsweek editors off the hook.

When the government forces you to get chipped at gunpoint, you've got big problems. Doesn't really matter what system they're using (but why wouldn't they use their own?), it's the fact that you're being forced to do something against your will that's the real problem here. It's the duty of all citizens to resist such tyranny, even if the government's intentions seem benign. They will claim it's to stop terrorism or to save the children, but really it's all about control. This has nothing to do with bitcoin and everything to do with fascism and totalitarianism, which must be resisted in all their forms.

But that's just it, isn't it? We are still in this web of authority, but bitcoin offers a vector out of it. But in order for bitcoin to thrive it needs to interact with the legacy system controlled by the religious authorities, whether it's dudes in mumus or a cloister of bankers in suits deciphering the oracle's mumbling about interest rates. 
It's possible they don't fully grok the powers unleashed by the bitcoin network. If that's the case, let's not push our luck and fight when we can muddle on (as humanity has always done) until the issue is moot and the outcome inevitable. Better that there be no legislation about bitcoin for now.
The root problem is that the government considers you and me assets to be hypothecated and used to create more debt. That's why they treat us like chattel. To them, we are. Until you fix that underlying issue you'll continue to see problems like overzealous bitcoin regulation, but it isn't really bitcoin being regulated. Bitcoin is just math on nodes -- you're the one being regulated here. 
All this talk about regulating bitcoin frames this issue improperly. We the people are the ones being regulated (and taxed!) with regards to money, drugs, sex, liquor, guns and damn near everything else. Until you change that fundamental fact, complaining about it with regards to bitcoin seems like a waste of time and breath.

But won't increasing adoption (spurred by PayPal) increase decentralization as well -- additional nodes, more miners, more developers, more people drinking the decentralized, trustless, anti-authority kool-aid? 
I encourage you to think of centralization and decentralization as twin spinning gyres that dance with each other in an ebb and flow. We will always have both, but if we design system intelligently they can enhance and complement each other instead of letting one gyre dominate the other (usually centralization dominates). It's likely that the micropayments solution will be at least partially centralized in order to keep from spamming the blockchain with tiny transactions. That doesn't mean bitcoin is centralized because the core is still decentralized. Instead, centralization is working for the benefit of decentralization.

There's definitely one thing I agree with you about -- we shouldn't necessarily be *fighting* Western Union. We should be converting them to our way of thinking.
WU has a lot of advantages. The 2 chief ones that I can think of are:
1. Extensive network of brick &amp; mortar stores
2. Compliance with existing rules &amp; regulations in countries around the world
Both of those things are what bitcoin needs in order to get to the next level. If WU accepted bitcoin it would benefit both WU &amp; bitcoin. In fact, WU could potentially save money if they started using btc to transfer money across borders. They could reduce their dependence on their banking partners and save fees in the process. Because of the competition with bitcoin they would likely pass some of those savings on to the consumer.
At the moment, Bitcoin is not a great pure-consumer play unless one or both of those actors has tech savvy and both are in countries that have a reasonable amount of bitcoin infrastructure (mostly developed counties at this point). This is being solved by numerous startups, but OP is correct that this infrastructure is not in place and optimized yet. *Yet.*
Bitcoin has the potential to change the game at the B2B level. Companies that move a lot of cash around have to pay Brinks and/or their banking partner a lot of money in fees every month. If a mere 10% of that money could be transferred via bitcoin they could start saving a lot of money *and* gaining leverage on their banking partners to cut them a better deal lest they move more money onto their bitcoin payment rail. WU could probably benefit from this more than most. Bitcoin is not going to utterly destroy all the legacy financial systems, but it is going to drive costs down and open whole new avenues of competition that didn't exist before.
WU has a decision to make. Today they are on top of the world, just like Blockbuster was a decade ago. Do they stick their heads in the sand and hope the coming tidal wave goes away? Or do they hop on a surf board and use bitcoin to their advantage?
In summary, this is not a bitcoin vs. WU quandary. This is bitcoin vs. SWIFT, LVTS, SEPA and the other underlying value transfer systems that are more fundamental than WU, which is riding on top of them. WU has every opportunity to become a bitcoin ally, just like Paypal is becoming. Bitcoin is still experiencing growing pains and it's not a perfectly built-out ecosystem yet. It doesn't have 40 years of infrastructure built around it like SWIFT does, but it has the potential to become even better because of it's global, decentralized nature.
Let's not be too adversarial to WU. Bitcoin is a disruptive technology, not a destructive one. Many companies will probably adapt to bitcoin. Good for them. Good for us too.

You raise an interesting issue with the legacy system: You can spend money with MasterCard on a holiday. But you can't fund a debit card or pay off your credit card or transfer money on a holiday. 
It's a strange design quirk and I find it a bit curious that even in this sub we tend to blame people for not knowing all the vagaries of the legacy system as if it's our fault that we have a crappy, unreliable and inflexible financial system.
It's similar to how nerds blame normal folks for not knowing every little detail about the web. "OMG, you 1D10t! You visited *that* site with IE?! You deserve those viruses, d00d!" Well yeah, *we* know that, but is it a good product if you can so easily and innocently fuck up your computer just by visiting a website?

To get more casual users you have to make it bandwidth-lite. Perhaps by limiting outbound connections to no more than 90% of upstream bandwidth. This will make sure web surfing and netflixing is still responsive. Pro users can remove this restriction at will, but I think upstream bandwidth should be capped by default. 
Secondly, the hard drive space is nontrivial, even for desktop users. Many of us are using small SSD drives as boot disks, leaving little spare room for the blockchain. It needs to be easy to store the blockchain on another drive. Maybe this is fixed in the most recent version, I dunno, but it's a key feature for casual node hosters.

To convince the anti-increase crowd, I think Gavin will have to focus even more on the fee issue. Gavin's already [discussed it before]( but it sounds like folks are determined to see what happens when there's no more block space. They think fees will rise. I think that may happen, but because of it, many people will simply stop using bitcoin and explore other opportunities. 
It looks like we'll find out either way. If transactions keep increasing, we'll hit the ceiling before the not-yet-scheduled March 2016 hard fork.
I see a lot of concern about people in poor, authoritarian countries being able to set up a node for cheap, which may be easier with 1 MB blocks. But I see the other side of that coin, too -- what about people in poor countries who've been priced out of bitcoin because it costs 30 cents to send a transaction while they're living on a dollar a day? 
I suggest the latter scenario will affect vastly more people than the former. I think rich countries will be running way more nodes for the foreseeable future... and that's okay. It's more important to me that poor folks are able to send small-dollar transactions easily with their cell phones running in SPV mode and not get raped by fees. The relatively-rich miners will be okay, even with the block-halving. We have plenty of time to bootstrap a more robust fee system in the next decade.

Oftentimes, the Trickster is just a mask that a protagonist wears to move freely. In bitcoin's case the trickster mask hides a powerful wizard - the Internet money wizard who is this sub's unofficial mascot.

Most of the third world is pretty much cell phone-only. They don't have a culture of laptops, let alone desktops. The electricity goes out every few hours, bandwidth is expensive, monitored by the state and intermittent. 
I don't think it's fair to expect bitcoin to solve these massive infrastructure problems. I'm all for mitigation, but you never addressed my concern about excessive fees for third world folks. 
And if folks are not already running a full node in these IP ranges, what is going to make them start? Is this truly a technical problem? Perhaps it's cultural.

Nodes listen for and verify transactions and hand them to the miners who confirm them. Miners get compensation, but nodes don't. This wasn't planned because the original software had both, but they got specialized and separated by the push towards high powered mining. So folks are trying to convince people to run nodes for free.

I assumed all these devices would be aimed automatically at 21's mining pool so they don't have to solo mine/host a node and the blockchain.

Also, he probably has only a few thousand dollars worth of assets on hand, aside from his house. Robbing Satoshi Nakamoto is realistic, but how would a thief steal Buffett's stocks and actually use them? Any attempt to move large amounts of his money would be noticed by his banks and brokers and moving that much cash isn't feasible in the short term as Bitcoiners like to mention. Rich people get a very high-touch experience from banks and you can't just steal all of a billionaire's wealth in a few minutes, even if you stole his passwords.

It requires a lot of brick 'n' mortar infrastructure and regulatory compliance in Tokyo, Chicago and everywhere else. The bitcoin part of it is relatively simple.

Gavin is right: Centralized solutions will pop up first and we may end up locked into something less than ideal. 
Concerns about too much centralization through excessive on-chain transactions are a legitimate worry, but they fall to 3rd or 4th place in my list of concerns. Mining centralization and development centralization are far worse *today* and both are already having negative effects. 
This forum is full of people confidently saying: "Bitcoin can't scale!" Bullshit. We haven't even tried it yet. Let's try and then see where we end up. I bet we'll see some issues and then ameliorate them through code optimizations.

2. reddit *pretends* to be anti-corporate and then spends all day wanking over Google products, Apple, Samsung or motherfucking Olive Garden. Do a search for OG and you'll see a ton of references to "free breadsticks" which is reddit repeating corporate key messages like good little consumers (and there's a fair amount of shills).
3. Remuneration for content creation is like everything else on reddit: heavily dependent on viral effects. Most will get nothing. Some will get a shitload. It's not fair, it's the network effect.
4. People are already changetipping and gelding for stupid puns. Why not give small change to actual creators? Not everybody is a tightwad. Some people are very loose with their money. If people feel they are having an authentic exchange with a content creator (no middleman, no paid marketing), then they are likely to donate, feel good about it, and encourage others to do so as well. Again, this is all about the network effect; humans are highly social and influenceable.

That's why we're going to start with 2 MB. Both Classic and Core are in agreement on that, right? It's nominally a dispute about timing.
The real dispute is about governance. I'm very concerned about any group of human beings having control over something like the block size because it will inevitably lead to those fallible humans picking winners and losers. 
We need to shift to an algorithm as soon as the research/testing allows so humans are removed from the equation.

This is one of the best posts I've read (in this forum) regarding the problems in Core-land. They had every opportunity to make a win-win trade early on in the debate but pride blinded them.
It's not that all BU folks even dislike Segwit, they just hate it being rammed down their throats as a scaling solution when it's actually more of an under-the-hood upgrade with a small scaling bonus. A savvy political operator could've gotten everyone on board for an 8 MB bump paired with segwit. This debate could've been over in 2015. 
But instead of using their energies to find consensus, they tried to blackball their opponents and convince their followers that all hard forks are bad and that only terrorist/communist/pedohiles would ever want to increase the blocksize. Now their chickens are coming home to roost. It turns out that being stubborn, arrogant and two-faced is a good way to make enemies.
Bitcoin desperately needs governance and a smooth process for future upgrades.

The problem with Core refusing to put a date on when they'll agree to hard fork to 2 MB+ is that, in the absence of a real date, speculation abounds. Many folks assume that Core intends to never hard fork it, which is reasonable considering all the anti-hard fork messaging on this sub.
I agree that we need a decent amount of time before the fork activates... which is why putting a date out there now is so critical. With no date, people are left to read tea leaves, just like when talking about the Federal Reserve raising rates. If Core was more straightforward with us there wouldn't be so much suspicion and fear. 
No date was put forth in Maxwell's roadmap. 
No date was put in the recent Core statement. 
Can you understand why this might unsettle people who long to escape the vagaries of Fed-speak? This ecosystem is full of techies who loathe ambiguity. Giving us nothing but vague promises causes people's fear-based hindbrain to kick into overdrive. A lot of money is on the line.
Give us a date, then people will calm the hell down and the hard fork will no longer be contentious.
Refuse to give us a date and people will run to Classic if only just to leave all the stressful ambiguity behind.

I think that's why the Classic team is proposing 2 MB for now.

IMO, a flex cap would be ideal, especially if it was similar to the difficulty readjustment, but that may be more complex and risky. We could also just do a small bump with a fixed size at first, but a flex cap could put this endless debate to rest for good.

Well, at least you admit you're arguing from a status quo bias, which is fallacious. 
However, you're still wrong: Change is constant, especially with regards to something like the blockchain which changes every day and behaves almost like a living thing. If the blockchain were to stop changing, it would be effectively dead.
The status quo is an illusion, and is rapidly crumbling under your feet. We've reached a fork in the road (no pun intended) and going straight is no longer an option. Choose a path, left or right, but the status quo you cherish is gone. 44% of *miners* are voting for bigger blocks?! I thought they had the most to lose and that they'd be dragged along, if at all, by the other nodes. It seems the old assumptions no longer work. That's a sign that the old order is rapidly fading.
I understand there's some anger, bitterness and resentment that comes along with change -- especially change that is perceived as a loss. But lashing out against others with different POVs is not going to help anything. Let the community discuss this freely and we will eventually congeal around a new consensus.
I repeat: There is no status quo. Let it go.
It's up to us in this sub and the devs to create a new one. Deleting stories does not help in this endeavor.

By your own definition, the 1 MB Bitcoin chain does not have consensus. There is significant disagreement even among key devs and experts.
It's like in a Parliamentary System when parliament has been dissolved -- there is no status quo to follow. Everything is up in the air until the next election. That's where bitcoin is right now.
So why not let the marketplace of ideas do its thing until we can re-emerge with a new consensus? Censoring ideas to enforce the (rapidly disintegrating) status quo is not helpful and is actually hurting our efforts for consensus because people feel attacked and suppressed.

I think we have to keep in mind that there are plenty of economically irrational attacks that could be masterminded by governments, banks and other groups with massive amounts of fiat to burn.

It's important to note we probably won't get to 1.0 on this chart (without an upgrade of some kind) because some miners are still using a soft limit of 750K.
And of course some blocks are found in a few seconds, but a continuously-full mempool may eventually impact that.

I didn't mean to imply that I support the absolutely-no-caps solution -- I'm convinced by Gavin's research into this and I think maybe a scaled back version of what he proposes is probably best. 
What I get concerned about is: Who gets to determine which transaction is "spam" and what is a "legit" transaction. Suddenly we're either making value judgments or forcing transactions to fight to the death, using money to determine a winner. This seems like it will completely take poor countries out of the market when they presently stand to gain the most. High fees are as dangerous to bitcoin's future as low fees.

FYI, "legit spam" = [bacn](
Marketing emails do indeed cost a few pennies or a fraction of a penny to send and that doesn't include the time it takes to write copy, format, add/purchase images, review it or set up for testing and distribution. I think most purveyors of bacn would happily send you a few satoshis to ensure delivery. It's not much more money than they already pay and even with a small bitcoin fee it's still way cheaper than direct mail. In fact, paying for delivery would add legitimacy and filter out their pseudo-bacn competition.
However, I'm not totally comfortable with a company running this. I think it needs to be built into a next-gen email protocol with lots of security built in. It seems like every time I read about somebody getting their btc stolen it's because their email got hacked. I'm not sure how it happened, but slowly over the course of the last few decades, developers and corporations have based so much of their security apparatus on customer's email accounts (password resets, etc.) that email has become a honeypot that hackers simply can't resist and yet email was not designed to be this critical to people's security; it simply doesn't measure up. Corporations and startups adding features on top of SMTP and such is nice, but it's can't beat having good security rolled into the protocol itself. Unfortunately, nobody but techies use GPG/PGP and it's difficult for normal people to even understand why it's necessary and useful. If it was built into the protocol people could publicly post their email addresses again. It's kind of ridiculous that we have to do stuff like =satoshi= (at) gmail =dot= com. 
People often think of success as a straight line from point A to point B. But in reality, there's lots of detours and roundabouts that need to be taken before you can reach your goal. In some ways I feel like bitcoin's success is dependent on a superior email protocol -- one that doesn't exist yet. Satoshi himself proposed this very idea -- of controlling your inbox through fee setting -- and I think it's a good one. However, this creates yet another pile of bitcoins stored on a startup's servers that is going to attract hackers and thieves like flies to honey. If it was built into the email protocol it should be more secure if only because the wallets would be spread across the blockchain. However, putting every single email through the main blockchain would be too much so this could be a great use-case for sidechains.

Beyond the BIT stuff, this is blowing my mind:




I've been wondering what USAA's plans are with regard to Coinbase. Soon I might not have to leave my USAA account to buy BTC. In fact, if they've worked out a special deal with Coinbase, why not make those transactions irreversible so I can have my coins instantly?
Why not show my Savings, Checking &amp; Bitcoin balance all on the same screen and instantly exchangeable with each other (small exchange fee for going between currencies, no doubt). Banks would be smart to front-run this "be your own bank" thing before it catches on. (But is USAA even a bank? Technically, they may be, but they're run more like a credit union. I'm a member but their exact structure still baffles me.)

I'd rather see an altcoin take this bullet first. 
Bitcoin is not just a toy anymore and I take issue with this statement:


Why not never? Since it's completely self-imposed we should avoid such an event if we can. I'd be more inclined to side with this line of thinking if there was already a robust fee-setting market *before* we play this unneeded and dangerous game of chicken.
I'm not sure why people get off on the idea of warring over inclusion in blocks when the whole point of an open system is that everybody can easily make a transaction. I see bitcoin more like email: In the future, 95% of transactions will be spam. And as along as the spammers pay their mining fees, that's okay.
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:41:59
I think you're ignoring who tainted the coins. The Evo admins did when they stole publicly-known coins. Now they have to deal with the consequences as they try to fence obviously stolen goods.

So yes, I agree that the overall trend line is up. But in my web development work I have to think about accessibility and even in our modern world there are myriad ways for someone to be disabled in a tech context. Our goal should be to make Bitcoin as easy and accessible as possible, especially since we are still in the early stages of humans learning about strong passwords and public key cryptography.

You raise an interesting point about the miners filling up blocks with fake transactions, but I've actually noticed the opposite -- most miners seem to have altered their software to be even lower than the 1 MB block limit. 
In your opinion, do you think that will stop if we jump to 20 MB or whatever it ends up being? My thought is that most miners will bump up their max block size slowly -- say 1.5 MB, eventually 2 MB and so on. Basically, the (future) protocol says 20 MB is fine, but the real-world miners are still concerned about losing blocks to DDoS attacks and so they will self-regulate by gradually raising their self-imposed block-size as the network grows.

Bitcoin would seriously help consumers here because bitcoin addresses are a hash of a public key and no bitcoin can be spent without the private key.

Fractional reserve systems can only work in the absence of bank runs. What if we had a randomly fomented event called Running of the BitBulls whereby everybody transferred all their money to a different wallet, offline, web or whatever. 
The ease of transferring bitcoin is what makes it so powerful and any bitcoin banks are going to have to allow fast transfers or lose out to the competition. If we do the digital equivalent of a cup check every few months, the banks will have no choice but to keep large reserves. 
And really, we should be using credit unions anyway. Not banks. And definitely not FRS banks.

Well, currently bitcoin *is* an investment, but I think you're talking about a hypothetical future where bitcoin is the reserve currency. 
People will still invest, but with a different mindset. Investing may be focused on avoiding bumps in bitcoin's value (it's not guaranteed to go up every year) and on high risk new ventures that offer a rare, but spectacular return.
But whenever skeptics assume a deflationary economy, they forget that *everything* changes. Bonds, stocks, interest rates, other currencies, Wall Street, precious metals -- all of these would be rocked to their core and fundamentally altered to survive in a deflationary paradigm. 
So investing as we know it today would no longer exist, but humans have always loved investing in the future... and gambling. Why do people play SatoshiDice if they could just sit back and watch their bitcoin appreciate? Because it's fun, just like fantasy football. People love picking winners and that part will never change, even if inflationary investment strategies become moot. 
Also, once bitcoin reaches its saturation point it will only increase in value by about 1% -- the population growth rate.

As others have noted, the solution for most people is to use a light client like MultiBit or Electrum. I couldn't in good conscience recommend the full client to a newbie since it doesn't make it clear that, "oh by the way, you have to leave this app running for 2 or 3 days straight before you can make a transaction so it can download the blockchain, which can only be stored on your boot drive and weighs in at nearly 10 gigs."
I just want the Satoshi client to give folks the option of storing the blockchain on an external drive and/or give folks the option to start out as a light client. I think it should use the superpeer model and only download the whole blockchain if the computer has enough storage and bandwidth and is left running long enough. Maybe ask people with a dialogue box whether they want to support the Bitcoin network and enhance their own security by downloading and hosting the blockchain. At least let people know what they're getting into. 
The blockchain is a concern, but it's easily dealt with. We just need to make some strategic choices, hopefully with the dynamic craziness of life in mind.

You're being downvoted like crazy, but in this age of gay marriage and polyamory I think it's important to leave room for traditional relationships. That's what some people want and we should respect everybody's choices and needs so long as they aren't unethical. I have some friends in a traditional relationship (she cooks, cleans; he is strong and of means) and they are very happy because they know what they want out of a relationship and found it in each other.

Sounds similar to what Ben Fulford, David Wilcock and others have been talking about, but I would be wary of the Dinar stuff as it is likely disinformation. 
Actually, I think Bitcoin would make a decent global reserve currency if it gets adopted before the reset finally happens, if it happens. The status quo must truly hate that this is even on the table, but I don't see another way out of the fiat/fractional reserve death spiral.

You may call me cynical, but I think you're naive if you don't realize that the economic and political elite are trying to dumb us down and keep us subservient. A highly educated cadre of creative kids is dangerous to the status quo, which always becomes rigid and focused on self preservation. 
You'll notice it was not a mainstream economist or a Wall Street trader who invented bitcoin. It was a maverick who didn't let anybody else tell him what cannot be done. I'll leave you with an appropos Mark Twain quote.

Thanks for being the only person in this thread to be polite and refrain from insults and arrogance. 
However, I think you're missing the same thing the others are: We the common people don't get a check for inflation every month. We have to rely on wage increases. What the insulting pricks don't realize is that I understand real terms all too well. [Look at this chart of wage increases versus productivity increases.](  American wages in real terms haven't gone up in 40 years so talking in terms of real interest rates is just a form of deception by the banks. They are insulated from inflation because they have tremendous capital for investments and the multiplier effect of fractional reserve policies. But the common people are getting squeezed tighter every year. 
You're also forgetting about the amortization tables that skew things so that the principle is the last to get paid off -- most of the early payments you make go towards interest, so the bank gets most of its profit up front, which can then be reinvested. But for a common person, one speed bump in your life and you may have trouble making those payments at all. 
Banks have the advantage of spreading this stuff out over many loans, meaning they'll probably break even or do better. Individual people do not have that luxury. And yet the banks still needed a trillion dollar bailout. Doesn't seem fair to me. We could have paid off every mortgage in the country for that kind of money, but the bankers made sure it went to their bottom line instead. Meanwhile, many Americans are underwater on their houses and they're not receiving enough of a raise to compensate. Slowly but surely the middle class is being erased as the banks grow fat off government largesse and get million dollar bonuses.
Bitcoin alone won't change this, but having a hedge against inflation could be a huge boon to most people's finances.

Agreed. Lets not look a gift horse in the mouth. What are some things that bitcoin really needs in order to grow and reach mass market acceptance?
I think we need a really easy, friendly light client that walks users through the set up process with a fun, informative wizard. We need to remember that most people don't know what the hell a public key vs. private key is. There's some education that has to happen. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 15:57:00
But people respond emotionally to money. We need to project a calm, reassuring vibe. I think using newb on reddit is fine given our audience and the complexity of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:12:41
True, but if we want to be really pedantic we should emphasize that it is a Cryptographic Currency. That's the true differentiator for bitcoin (well decentralization too), whereas the dollar is already virtual and digital via online banking. If anything, we should promote its similarity to the existing digital dollar to make people feel more at ease with digital money. Some people don't realize how digitized the dollar is; even as they swipe their debit cards at the store. There's going to be a lot of education needed. 
So I agree but I also think pushing the term cryptocurrency is necessary to full understanding of bitcoin's advantages.

My understanding is that Japan has already had several decent mobile-friendly, digital payment systems for over a decade through various services and feature phones that have enough features to blur the line between the Nokia-style feature phones and smart phones. But the Japanese use their phones for everything, to the extent that many don't bother with PCs as you mentioned. 
So bitcoin doesn't really fill that niche and since many folks are still using feature phones it might be difficult or impossible to get bitcoin wallets working on those. For those who don't know, feature phones come with baked in apps. It's not like the app marketplaces on iOS and android, though those platforms are influencing the Japanese phone marketplace. 
I think the best way to get bitcoin adoption in Japan is to encourage people w/ Google and Apple phones to use it as a store of value or investment vehicle. The currency side of things may have to wait until they get that critical mass so phone companies make apps for it.

With the insane difficulty raises this thing might not even turn a profit if you get it in December.

I'm starting to think of mining gear like organic produce. That shit goes stale so fast... And stale food/mining rigs don't sell.

The fact of the matter is you're right. The current bitcoin marketplace is far too small. But bitcoin's strength is in its power to store value and hedge against inflation. Bitcoin has a long road to go before it works as a currency, but it's already kicking ass as a store of value.

Beyond the obvious statement that belief backs it, I would say that mining is what backs bitcoin because the miners keep it secure and verify transactions and there are a lot of dollars and yuan invested in that mining equipment.

If the interest rate is lower, that's a huge win for the people. The rising value of bitcoin looks like a better deal than wages, real or otherwise that barely budge. 
The banks always win, but in the transition to a deflationary economy they could be severely damaged. Or they could mutate into something less predatory, assuming prudent legislation. They are truly a vampire squid on humanity's face right now. Anything that bitcoin can do to remedy the situation (through disintermediation of banks) is very welcome. If I can borrow 150K from a private individual instead of a bank on better terms, maybe I'll do my part. The blockchain offers a public ledger that can secure our deal assuming a third party for escrow. Bitcoin upsets the balance if it gains force. 
I don't think any of your economics textbooks can tell us exactly what will happen if bitcoin goes to the moon. This is uncharted territory. I suggest you study up on some bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-12-17 19:06:19
I agree that banks are not totally protected from inflation, but they are likely to be on the scene when that new money enters the system and expands due to fractional reserve lending. Also, much of that money is created by the Fed allowing banks to sell the Fed murky assets. It would be great if I could sell my crappy investments to the government! 
Not sure how it works in Norway, but in America the banks have the additional advantage of using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to back housing loans. Both GSEs needed to be bailed out during the 2008 crisis. Oh and don't most banks package their mortgages into MBSs and sell them to someone else? They assume virtually no risk. 
It's crazy here in the USA. The banks have all the cards. They basically can't lose.

Haha, you don't have a mortgage do you?
You can use an [amortization calculator]( to find out how much you'd pay for a house in today's market. 
I used their default values over 30 years. A $150K house will cost you $123K in interest over the life of the loan. And today's interest rates are quite low historically. I had to get 6.5% rate initially. Calculate that -- ouch! Refinancing is worth it if you have a high one. 
See? The banks win either way.
