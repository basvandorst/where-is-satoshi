Bitfinex is not accepting any financial responsibility for the hack, but instead distributing the burden amongst all of the victims of the hack? 
You guys screwed up here, not us.

For the people who "don't really want to own bitcoin", it goes beyond volatility concerns.
A recent survey we did of "non-Bitcoiners" revealed what their reservations about Bitcoin are. The top 3 reasonably equally weighted reasons for not wanting to use Bitcoin:


This is largely an education issue, and will improve over time. 


It surprised me that people care so much about volatility when it comes to microtransactions. I can see how pegging the value makes a huge difference for large amounts, but did not expect to see people who were considering using ChangeTip to be concerned with volatility.


Often cited concerns were "I've heard it's used for drugs" and "It can be hacked". **This is the most challenging obstacle to overcome**, because it's a consumer perception issue that's much larger than ChangeTip.
So while the pegging is interesting, I think  needs much more attention to get people comfortable using bitcoin.
The Bitcoin community needs to build easy bridges from USD to Bitcoin to get these users comfortable. USD is probably going to be around for at least another 5-10 years :), so we need to figure out how to interoperate for these late adopters.

Sorry about the troubles. It was an honest mistake. We're releasing a new version of this page on Monday, and we accidentally hid the link, because we are changing the link on Monday. 
We couldn't see it ourselves, because we had the new version of the page showing for staff.

Given the way that a lot of bitcoin companies have treated users, I understand your skepticism, but if you look at the history of ChangeTip, we've treated users with respect, and that isn't going to change now.

Ultimately, we will follow the law, which means returning funds "to the state". Eww. 
The site is running in a very cheap way now, and I don't mind maintaining it in a low cost way. We'd much rather return funds to people - so please help spread the word.

Flattr didn't have a button that you could solicit tips with. I haven't looked into who invented it though, because I had no interest in patenting it.

I thought about typing up a long winded response explaining what actually happened, detailing out the circumstances and complexities of negotiating the market, fundraising climate, execution, team, community, and timing challenges of doing a startup in Silicon Valley.

Have you tried it recently? We completely reworked it.

We're looking into this and will report back with our findings shortly.
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:21:26
We have dug in to this and have some answers.
First, the tip API you are referring to only shows tips that *you* have sent or received, or people who have explicity chosen to make everything public. Just want to clear that up for anyone who may have misunderstood - this isn't for all tips.
Second, you've misunderstood what the `private`flag means. This flag is for if the user has a public "profile" page that showcases their ChangeTip profile. It's not an indication that the user explicitly asked for more privacy. These kinds of misunderstandings are easy when you are poking around with internal APIs.
We include some information about the person receiving tips in this API, so that on your home page you can see a nice picture of the recipient of the tip. The information that is displayed is *publicly available* and/or *explicitly provided* by you through ChangeTip. **People are in control of their information**. That's the easiest short term solution for anyone who happens to be concerned about this.
We're considering adding a new feature to disable the display of this data. Something along the lines of
```[ ] Hide my profile data from the people who send me tips ```
Although that may be overkill, because again, you are in full control of the data you provide to ChangeTip.com, so people who don't want their profile picture shown or their location data available won't provide it in the first place, or they are free to clear it out. So in reality, no one will likely ever check that box, they just won't provide the data in the first place.
An engineer is looking more deeply into this now. I'll repost back here when we have more information. 
As for your comments about our engineering abilities - I'm just gonna pinch your cheeks and call you adorable. Further, your association with the buttcoin community makes it hard for me to take you seriously. Care to share your motivations for the inflammatory and misleading tone of your post?
