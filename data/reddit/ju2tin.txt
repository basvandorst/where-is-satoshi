Thanks.  Why is the reward for that block 50 BTC, instead of 25?  I guess because the reward was higher back in 2009?  Man, imagine being able to mine huge piles of 50 BTC blocks using only an old computer running in your basement... :-/
Also, is it the case that by using a computer to mine for new bitcoins, you're also allowing that computer to be used by the "network" to audit/validate transactions using existing bitcoins, thereby creating new blocks in the blockchain?  If so, do miners get compensated for this, other than through the (increasingly small) possibility that their efforts will result in them mining a new bitcoin for themselves?

Okay, excuse me for another n00b question, but... I thought miners "mine" NEW bitcoins that have never before existed.  How do miners affect transactions involving bitcoins that have already been mined and are now being used by people in transactions?
I've actually read quite a bit on Bitcoin  but don't understand this role of miners as you've described it.

Not sure if it matters, but I've heard (perhaps incorrectly) that all bitcoin transactions are recorded sequentially in the blockchain and I just wondered how that could work as the number of transactions becomes really large.
People in this thread seem to be saying that transactions are grouped into a sequential series of blocks, without each individual transaction being recorded sequentially.  In theory, I could see that being a problem if you have several transactions recorded in the same block and can't prove which one came first.

When Amazon starts taking Bitcoin, it will be the biggest impact yet.
