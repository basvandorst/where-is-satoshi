The facts don't lie. 
My $200k deposited in the bank (2 banks to be accurate) in December 2017 is still worth $200k and I can still buy $200k worth of goods if I want, today.
Had my view of the world been as lucid and as wide as yours, I would have put that into BTC, stuck it on my ledger and stuck it in my drawer. Today it would be $80k.
So yeah, keep telling me how bad my judgement is. It's very entertaining. I genuinely haven't laughed so hard in ages.
No doubt you'll come up with some line about how BTC will stabilise once we get mass adoption - but you won't get mass adoption without stability. It's a catch 22 and you can't see it.


It's better that loss of value happens over 10 years than 10 days as with BTC. Also it's offset by my property investments which will be worth 10x what I paid for them.


Based on what? Your own speculation or just blind hope? BTC needs mass adoption for that to be even remotely possible, yet you keep glossing over the problem, adoption in scale won't happen due to security, there is no sign that it will ever happen.


You said it again, it's only as secure as you can make it. The elephant in the room is that people DO NOT WANT TO LOOK AFTER THEIR OWN MONEY which is why we have banks. We moved on from looking after our own money in the year 1500 for a reason and people aren't ready to go back in time.


Funny thing is it's not just my mindset it's the mindset of all adults who have families, jobs, wages, savings that kind of thing. The only people who don't share it are kids who think $100 is a lot of money and have no experience of managing money and want to be anti government and see BTC as some kind of rebellious cause.

Last dec I had $20k worth of Fiat and $20k worth of BTC, now my Fiat is worth $20.1k and my BTC is worth $8.2k in BTC (dropped $500 since 2 weeks ago) LOL.
2 weeks and not a single rebuttal. Says it all.

Yes, the selling point of Crypto. Suicide after heavy losses.

For some reason you keep neglecting the element of security, I guess because with BTC you have none and thus are up shit creek without a paddle on this one. 
Say what you will about banks and governments, but as has been beaten to death, your money is safer and agree with it or not, people like it that way. My own 200k is safer in a bank, I am protected against loss unlike with a BTC wallet (let's put aside the protection against massive crashes in value; but also take a note to highlight that fact I'm super fucking glad my 200k isn't in BTC right now).
That single fact alone trumps any downsides to the banking system, which are largely subjective.
You won't ever get away from that mentality and thus people's attitudes won't ever change enough to give any credence to the mass adoption of BTC that you dream of. On the whole, people like being looked after by governments, especially when it comes to their money.
So by all means, put on your tin foil hat, run to the hills and be your own bank with your little piece of paper and your hardware wallet (and your ever depreciating BTC).
The rest of humanity will keep on going regardless.

nah the best time was back in dec at $19k.
Fucking idiots.
@_date: 2018-05-23 08:27:00


Yes, you hit the nail on the head. The problem you have is people do NOT want the responsibility of being the security for their wages &amp; savings. Hence why they use banks instead of keeping cash in a safe.


Not in the developed world. I have $200k in savings; this is 100% protected by the bank in case of a cyber attack / fraud / theft. If the bank were to close it would be protected by the state.
With BTC this would be severely at risk with NO protection.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:43:27
Someone said that to me once; only it was about dropping back under $10k - apparently I was dreaming.
I loled then too.

For security.
People have been ablr to choose between looking after their own money (via cash storage) or using the services of a Bank for years, and 99.5% of people choose to keep it in a bank, and they do so for security and protection.
The only people not wanting to keep it in a bank are those in corrupt countries, money launderers, tax avoiders and criminals who need to keep their money hidden.
With Bitcoin this doesn't change - you're kidding yourself if you think people in the developed world will want to keep their savings and get their wages paid into anything other than a regulated / government protected banking system.
I sometimes feel this sub is largely kids who's only concept of big money is $100 in pocket money from mom &amp; dad.
In the real world people simply don't want to look after their own money, that much is irrefutable fact.

And it's down 60% since Dec.

I have $200k in the bank, not angsty.
I'd be angsty iof I had $200k in BTC though, watching it drop, drop, drop drop. Got out at $16k moved fiat into bank.

Well last dec I had $20k in Fiat and $20k in BTC, now I have $20.1k in Fiat and $8.6k in BTC.
So yeah keep telling me how much better BTC is, i'm all ears.
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:35:16
Jesus christ, people say that every day. This shit makes Bitcoin look like a rebellious cause for angsty teenagers.
Fucking pathetic.

Your entire argument for BTC is noble but you even admit it's built on pure speculation and hope. 
BTC needs mass adoption on such a large scale for any kind of stability, we all know that, but we also know mass adoption won't happen uintil BTC becomes as stable as fiat and as secure as a bank.
You still haven't provided any evidence or detail of when and how this massive change will happen.
It's of no use right now to any business as a form of payment (I say this as someone who accepts BTC) it's too volatile. The $90 worth of BTC I accepted last week is now worth far less. That's not good for a business owner.
It's also no use as a store of value - that $200k I stored in Dec is now worth just $80k. Telling me to look at the big picture or zoom out and see past gains isn't going to work, nobody is going to store their savings on wallets with that kind of volatility and risk.
So where is it's use?
It's only use right now is it's unregulated trading options (which is how I use it).
So come on share with us your wisdom.
1)  How will BTC become a viable currency or a store of value without mass adoption? 
2) How will you get mass adoption without stability?
3) How will you convince the developed world to be their own bank (we've already shown people currently opt for banks over looking after their own fiat).
4) What is the use of BTC TODAY.

People won't want a third party looking after their private keys unless these are all government insured against losses, hacking, crashes. 
Banks have 1 huge benefit over BTC and that is security.

James is smart, he wants to earn interest and put his money somewhere safe.
He went on Reddit and was told Bitcoin is the future, so he brought a hardware wallet and invested all his money in BTC.
3 month later James decided he needed some of that money.
But James lost his little piece of paper with his 24 phrases on it.
James now has no access to his money. The government can't help. His friends can't help. He is alone.
James' wife left him and took the kids.
James committed suicide shortly after, his last thought was "why didn't I just put it in a bank where it's safe".
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:22:36
It may be inflation proof but it's not crash proof that's why people don't need bitcoin.
Fancy having $20k in savings in Dec then seeing that go to $6k in a matter of weeks.
Yeah where do we sign up.
