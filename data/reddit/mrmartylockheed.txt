It is also a tenth the size of the US with a quarter 
of it's population.

This is the only known way to force a price reversal.

I don't understand. How did they get 'duped' when palladium is a more valuable precious metal than gold. It's also about half the weight of gold. I'd happily take gold plated pure palladium over pure gold.

… a 'you can take my gold but you'll never take my vinyl' sort of deal.

Europe's not free. Not what I call freedom anyway. Some of us are the most spied upon people on the planet along with the US. The Stasi would have been jealous. I can't even write this or go outside without being tracked where I go, who I talk to, where I drive, who I see, who my friends are, what I do, what they do, etc, etc, etc, etc. We've given up our freedom for animated icons.
Edit - you seem to believe you're free because you're told that you're free.

There are four hodlers in this pic if they've bought BTC and possibly another eight hodlers who were already stupidly rich before they bought BTC. The other guy might just be rich or else was a sodler in 2017.

True but you get the point. The truth is that many countries accept big numbers of immigrants and not many countries accept illegals. The US is almost 16 times the size of the UK but the UK has about 600,000 immigrants a year. Germany has about 5 - 600,000 a year.
Edit - I forgot this. [
Illegal southern border immigration is about 100,000 into the US according to this.
Looks like legal immigration to the US is about 1,000,000 a year on average.

If only they were. If only they were. It'd be a great market.

This is the antidote to the roller coaster up guy hex. 14K should be within sight again in about nine hours.

I think we'll see more of this meme in the years to come.

I'm interested as $72/day is more than I can make on Bitcoin at the moment.

Just Bitcoin, I invest in GRQ and MIM, so I'm cryptosafe.
