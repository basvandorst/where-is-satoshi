Fiat and bitcoin were created out of nothing. All pyramid schemes sound good on the surface, and sure you could make some money on them, but they WILL return to zero.

precious metals are precious because they're rare and USEFUL, desirable for their qualities.

The software for bitcoin isn't a secret, is it? Pretty sure the tech can be replicated. But people are caught up in the \*\*hysteria\*\* of Bitcoin (TM) that they can't see the forest for the trees. Oh well, don't believe me then.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:15:19
it's not an alternative, it's fiat. it's the most popular fiat crypto, but that doesn't mean it's always going to be that way.
just wasting electricity doing useless "work". the labor theory of value was disproven years ago.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:35:50
So you admit that the only reason you are enthusiastic about it is because of future gains you may obtain?
A currency cannot both be a good investment AND affordable. Gresham's Law is a thing.

why can't blockchain be recreated? it's tech, right? 
i want you to spell it out in your own words.

can a currency be both a good investment and affordable?

no, just a person who doesn't believe in ANY crypto
@_date: 2019-07-23 04:16:53
those things have value because of their characteristics unique to them, bitcoin only has speculative value.

myspace used to be the biggest social network, then facebook took over after a few years. just because it's the biggest now, doens't mean its going to be that way forever. confirmation bias.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:45:28
if you knew bitcoin's eventual price would be 5 cents, would you be as enthusiastic over it as you are right now?
of course not.
there are other alternatives--not other cryptos--besides bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:59:23
my argument about what might happen is based on the FACT that there is nothing inherent to bitcoin that can't be replicated \*aside from its popularity.\* and its popularity stems from speculation.
sure, as long as it's popular, it will be valuable. but what happens when its no longer popular?
@_date: 2019-07-23 04:10:10
what does that have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:25:59
It's not a store of value...store of value means stability, not volatility.
Like I said in the title of this post, if bitcoin was going down over time would you be as enthusiastic about it as you are now?
@_date: 2019-07-23 07:12:16
Look, I told you, I would be in agreement with you (!) if Bitcoin were the only crypto that existed. Due to scarcity. But, the ONLY reason I have never been on board for 6 years is because there is nothing stopping other cryptos from diluting the utility value of bitcoin. Sure, bitcoin has "built in deflation" but that doesn't take into effect other cryptos essentially diluting the value. Competition lowers prices, you should know this basic economic rule. Sure, you may be right about making money, right now, but the value WILL fall in time, it's a basic economic principle. I don't believe in any fiat (including cryptos), I believe in precious metals, as they are truly scarce. They can't be created from nothing.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:53:31
you're enthusiastic about the eventual money you could make off it. be honest.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:49:37
you didn't answer the question.
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:33:25
assuming demand for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:37:20
fiat is fiat, created from nothing, it will return to nothing (of value). 
contrast this to precious metals which have a limited supply in the earth's crust.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:13:57
I don't have to, there are numerous cryptos all around the world that could easily fill the shoes. But bitcoin surges because of to the moon fantasies.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:53:04
\&gt; It's not all about price, though that brings enthusiasm because higher  price means "it's working". It's actual proof that the idea is working.  And if you look up what the idea is you'll understand how much better  Bitcoin is than a baseball card for storing value. 
that is the mechanism by which pyramid schemes run on "i'm making money therefore this is a good investment". those schemes work until they don't.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:12:16
even if the price goes down?
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:41:47
in the hopes of it appreciating even more in the future. 
if you knew the future price was going to be 5 cents, would you still be as enthusiastic?
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:52:32
Bitcoin can't be both a good investment and affordable.
Pick one.
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:07:47
bitcoin is based on speculation. that's it.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:41:03
okay so you believe in the technology.
technology can be recreated and replicated.
so either you believe in the potential money you could make off of it, or you believe in the technology. pick one.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:19:36
if Bitcoin was the only crypto, YOU might have a point.
@_date: 2019-07-23 04:09:43
if you knew the price was going to be worth 5 cents, would you still be this delusional and emotionally driven?
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:28:29
precious metals are used for coins and jewelry because they are valuable, rare enough but not too rare, beautiful, and can be easily worked.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:21:29
not really, it was created from nothing, that is the eventual value of it.
you are only so hysteric about it because it's valuable. like i said, if the value of bitcoin was 5 cents, would you still be as enthusiastic?
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:30:43
technology can be recreated. so much for the inherent deflation.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:39:50
Just because bitcoin is an alternative doesn't mean it's the correct one.
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:50:37


ever hear of ta thing called hysteria? you're essentially saying "this is valuable because it's valuable". \*\*you're not giving me a reason why it should be valuable aside from tautological arguments.
\&gt; Competition won’t lower BTCs price because it’s a limited supply of 21  million and regardless of what ever shit coins come to market they are  not and have not succeeded in taking away its market dominance, would  you like source material?. 
just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it won't happen. yahoo used to be more popular than google, and myspace used to be more popular than facebook, etc etc.
@_date: 2019-07-23 07:16:34
speculation is good when it's fulfilling a need.
wasting energy mining 1s and 0s because people think the value of the imaginary 1s and 0s is going to be worth more in the future is completely shortsighted. those 1s and 0s are not fulfilling a need besides speculation in and of itself. the utility of bitcoin is the blockchain, and that is not inherent to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-24 07:57:45
If the price of bitcoin was going to be 5 cents, would you still be as enthusiastic about it as your are now?
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:48:16
bitcoin is a blockchain, and blockchain is technology. technology can be recreated. thereby reducing the value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:40:55
i'm not denying short-term gains.
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:09:12
My bet will not entail speculating on other cryptos, that's for sure. They're all shit.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:42:15
if the price was going down, would you still be rationalizing it as useful?
just because it's valuable now doesn't mean it will be later.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:34:28
if bitcoin was worth 5 cents, would you all still be this delusional and emotionally driven?
@_date: 2019-07-24 08:25:45
so you're enthusiastic about it because of the potential to gain money from it. sounds like any pyramid scheme i've ever heard of. 
quick, better recruit some naive people and pump up the price some more.
you all are fucking crazy.
@_date: 2019-07-23 06:18:49
\&gt; And as I’ve already shown you there  is nothing stopping anyone creating their own token, but good luck  convincing the miners globally that they should transfer all their hash  power over to the other untested tokens network ������.
"good luck convincing Myspace investors that they should transfer their investment to untested social networks like Facebook"
like i said, PLEASE give me a reason why bitcoin is inherently valuable besides it's popularity aka speculation. you can't. and THAT is my entire argument. you can't just say "well other altcoins aren't as good as bitcoin". that's because they're ALL shit, including BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-23 06:38:34
you can send money overseas on any other crypto.
please, give me an reason why bitcoin is so good besides being popular.
that video doesn't explain why bitcoin is the ONLY crypto that can solve the Byzantine problem. other cryptos can solve it, they just aren't as popular.
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:46:58
companies produce value, and stock is a part of that value. bitcoin itself is based purely on speculation, as the technology is not inherent solely to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:28:06
well at least you are honest.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:50:28
bitcoin started out the same way as those other cryptos. what makes it different than being first and name recognition?
you didn't even answer the question: if the price was going down, would you still be as enthusiastic about it? 
are you supportive of the money you could make, or are you supportive of the actual tech behind it? the tech behind it can be replicated, it's just technology.
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:10:00
why do you think gold has been valuable to humanity for 1000s of years, just tradition? it is one of the most--if not the most--useful metals on earth.
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:29:34
The only thing giving bitcoin its value is it's popularity.
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:08:11
it doesn't meet all the requirements of money.
@_date: 2019-07-23 05:55:37
okay, so blockchain is what is valuable. great. so what exactly is stopping anyone else from creating a blockchain that has the same function and utility as bitcoin? NOT just copying bitcoin, obviously. bonus points for not referencing bitcoins current popularity.
you're only argument is literally "bitcoin is valuable because it's popular"
btw, pyramid schemes rely on recruiting new participants...
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:12:59
But you're only enthusiastic about the price going down because of the hope of eventual gains in the future, aka buy low sell high.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:40:21
If the price was going down over time, would you still be as enthusiastic about it?
