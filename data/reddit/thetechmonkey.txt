I am clearly new to this. But yeah I bought on gdax and there is an option to send to BTC address.
However how do I send from one BTC address to another?
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:46:40
Thanks but how is that actually done?

Thanks Youra\_towel.
When I go to [Blockchain.info]( I am redirected to [BLockchain.com]( this is what I  mean about confusing as people say use [Blockchain.info]( but not .com but they appear to be the same. one redirects to the other

What? What are forked coins?

Legend worked like a treat!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:33:48
AFAIK GDAX is Coinbase, they are the same
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:10:02
I think there's a huge amount of activity at the moment, lots of new buyers and the network is struggling.
Coinbase is sound though, just be patient

Thanks so muchh ladies and gents, you are legendary.

Perfect - thank you that's exactly what needed to happen. You're a legend

I made this on using coinbase/gdax. It might help.

Regardless the point of the video is don't look at what it has gone up by in last 12 months and think " I have missed the boat" as that is what people have thought at every time it has gone up significantly.
If it's of any comfort, I don't like most of that guys videos as it smells too much of a marketing scam, but he makes a good point in that vidro
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:09:21
Thanks for the advice, very much appreciated.  But how do you define it?  I would like it to be £1mil, but is that realistic? I would be happy with £10k, but wouldnt want to pull out early
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:38:39
Are those jumps real? I thought my web interface was going mad
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:10:20
That is really good advice, thank you, I will do that
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:34:51
Thanks I will check it out!

not looking for whether I should or not, but whether "you" would or not.
If I were to say here have $8,000, but I need it back in 1 month, no questions asked.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:52
Well I cant say for certain, but I say more likely just struggling to cope with demand, which is the same as a DDoS
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:23:45
Cost me £6 to send £500, seemed fair to me
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:20:46
Depends on why you're buying? The point of bitcoin is to buy and then spend like cash (but without the banks having control )
In which case no it's not too late.
If your want to buy and sell quickly to make a short term profit, then it's a gamble and you may be too late.
If you plan on buying and holding it for a long time, then no it's not too late.
This video I made may help: 
Tldr; no it's not too late

No worries, you're a few steps ahead of where I was when I asked the same question then :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:09:06
Sorry I pressed send too quickly.
I.mean is there an exchange that has better rates if you're buying small amounts. Or are they all about the same ?
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:56:08
This is the bit that concerns me, I thought the whole point of the paper wallet was ot to share the private key with anyone.
If I have to put it in to a software wallet, whats the point in the paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:30:09
Thank you so much for the assistance.
I have new issue however, I did a bank transger to coinbase to get the money there.  However it would only allow me to transfer in Euro's not in GBP.
Now the money is in Coinbase as Euro's but to desposit it in GDAx it says I have to have it in GBP.
How do I get the money there?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:32:36
Thank you. Care to share the link to your shop?
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:13:18
Complete noob here myself but here is my best understanding.
Prices rise and fall due to:
1) Demand
2) events happening in the industry
1) the more demand there is, the higher the price will go.
2) if a big company like Dell or Microsoft say they are accepting bitcoin . Or a major country says they have agreed bitcoin can used then demand will increase as will prices.   Conversely if some bad news comes out like a hack or similar price will go down.
When is the best time to invest? Now, tomorrow, next week.
Whenever you can really. You might invest today and prices will go down, but they should come back up again.
Don't invest for short term.profit unless you have loads of money and don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
It's all gambling and no one can guarantee what will happen. Some can make more educated guesses than others but that's about it.

I had the question about 2 weeks ago. Found this video which explains it nicely.
 ( the short answer is no it's not too late)
However be prepared for some frustration getting your first coins.  It's a little bit of hard work.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:41:44
I havent had this issue, however GDAX/Coinbase have had some performance issues today as demand spiked.
I would just give it a little time.
Also their support is non-existent.  I emailed about an issue over 2 weeks ago and am still awaiting a response.
Good luck though

Not sure if this is what you mean?
so that shows current price every 10 mins of BTC/Euro and LTC/Euro
But it's customisable to whatever currency / crypto you want

I am in the UK and used GDAX.
You have to do a SEPA transfer to their bank. Said it would up to 2 days. Took about 12 hours. All went through fine and I have not have my bitcoin.
Although coinbase is experiencing some network problems at the moment.

Thanks everyone for the help and the advice. Would you now wait a little and see where this drop bottoms out?

Firstly you should not keep your BTC in any exchange. If the exchange dies then so does your BTC .
Software wallets in my opinion are just too risky. Any software can be hacked or backdoored or worked around in another manner.
Hardware wallets are more secure and most people seem to recommend Trezor. ( Think that's how you spell it)
I personally use a paper wallet.

Excellent, love the designs!! and well done on getting BTC as a payment method :)
Do you mind if I ask what might be a daft question as I havent set up just yet.  When someone pays in Bitcoin, is there a long delay between them sending the payment and your shop confirming payment received?
As I have seen you need the transfers to be confirmed at least 3 times before they are yours, so does this slow things down on the customers side?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:52:09
They are not yours until they are in your wallet

SO not good if you are planning a short term investment plan in BitCoins
@_date: 2013-10-04 09:40:18
Why do people keep asking if it's a Ponzi scheme? Quite clearly a ponzi scheme requires someone to coerce you in to buying something on the promise you will make money.  Every site you buy bitcoins on tells you to be cautious as there are no guarantee's.
Cringe indeed
