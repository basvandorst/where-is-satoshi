It's a radio from Argentina I can give you the web if you want
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:45:43
this one? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:52:57
Let's put the hypothetical case that all bitcoins are erased (once all the 20,999,999.9769 BTCs were created) we lose all of our hope to save the human kind?
@_date: 2013-03-29 11:22:52
^ This made my day.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:55:23
So... they are gone? they are now BTCs without a home? or they can be used again since all the BTCs are allways in the blocks?
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:14:42
That's exactly what I don't want to do. I want that the people finish with a good concept of bitcoin and say "Fuck yeah, that's awesome, I do really want to get into bitcoins"
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:36:15
I supposed that if you where commented that you didn't down vote :P
It's okay, you don't have to appologize for anyone. I don't care about the downvotes, the Internet is 75% haters, I just really come to see what you guys think.

I'm asking D: I DEMAND AN ANSWER.
@_date: 2013-03-30 22:55:42
Uff, I finally have it.
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:45:18
That should be the best description in the world.
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:41:54
I didn't mention it, but was hard to respond at "How are they created?"
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:03:40
I like your style.
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:50:56
You are doing a good for this world, we are not worthy.

It has be done! I'll have the recording in 15 minutes, but is in spanish.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:23:01
Meh, we will see. Just chill out and hold on.
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:20:24
It helps! I know all the basics of farming (tried it my self) that you can buy them from a lot of places, and how do they work, but I'm afraid that no-tech people does not get me when I'm explaining. Thanks anyway :)

Focus in the hypothetical case (?) Once all the bitcoins were erased (ALL OF THEM, not even a 0.00000000000000000000001 BTCs left) is game over for us?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:29:53
Already checked it it, I'm not too comfortable with forks, they foment fragmentation, fragmentation is bad :/
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:03:17
That's the spirit!

So, when can you start to work?
@_date: 2013-10-30 11:02:25
How much of the 100% of your sales are in BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:58:43
I find the question "Who is Satoshi" one of the hardest things to anwser in this subreddit. No for the response "The inventor of Bitcoin" it's too complex for us to understand.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:07:20
I don't think he can actually, his using the same HDD with a couple of formats, they are lost forever :(
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:24:49
I think you nailed (in one or another way) the concep of bitcoins.
But can't really tell about Mt.Gox, is not a "hack" is a bit more complex.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:05:25
They are poor lonely BTCs without a home :(
I will start a refuge to give a home to all the BTCs in the world without owners :') (My home)
