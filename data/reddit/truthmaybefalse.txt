Even bigger than the Orange Juice Futures trade that put Duke &amp; Duke out of business based on that phony crop report back in 83'? Wow, i'm in!

In the last 100 years,  $1 is now worth @ $.06.  So yeah, stable... in a downward fashion

the majority of people i interact with have only maybe heard the term bitcoin, but none of them have any idea what it is or how to use it.  It was scary moving money from the exchange to a wallet that first time, but it wasnt hard.  i see this as a huge plus for bitcoin.  with the price doing what it has over the past few years,  i think all these peple will start to come around, then its moon time for bitcoin

yes i did
edit.  but i plan on using it to make transactions. Hodl sounds great, but i think it hurts us more in the long run

well, since you dont really need these companies to have access to your money, i assume they could use some sort of blockchain diagnosis software to sort out all your accounts and bills/salaries etc. then you or whoever pays the bills gets an email or whatever with the amounts owed to each address, then you pay it. or you could just do it yourself, it would be your choice. i see that as the beauty of bitcoin.

yea, but to get people interested or comfortable with it a lot of us need to use it and show that it does work, just my 2 cents though
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:28:09
i plan on replacing what i spend before i spend it, and add to my total when i have extra money, so im essentially holding while also using it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:30:11
if that were the case, it would be my first. but thank you, i think
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:23:26
exactly, this is my game plan
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:22:04
Its pretty basic, but a good start, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:35:19
way less than you did, but that was only because i still cant pay any bills i have with it.  If that happens, i will put a lot more in

not australian, so not sure what that entails.  but i bet the government would love a bitcoin transaction ledger for tax record purposes.  
But yeah, business owners would open a wallet they control.  There could be services that offer services to manage their accounts like a bank, but woulnt be needed.  
As for the speed, ive heard of a/the lightning network being used in conjunction with bitcoin for smaller faster transactions

i think someone just needs to get out there and show them how to use it.  Charge cards were pretty complicated when they first came out.  You had that big swipe/roller/imprinter that had to manually copy the customers card onto carbon paper receipt,  then you had to phone it in from the back to verify funds etc.  this will be no different with all the apps and tech being geared for this market

ok, to break my question down a little more, it's predicted the last block will be mined around the year 2140 give or take. leading up too that last block being mined, the time between mining a new block could be a long time . Does this mean transactions will take longer to confirm, or is there another solution to validate transaction other than mining a new block? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:09:27
ok, thx, so to help me out, it appears to say that when the last bitcoin is mined, "miners" will continue to solve the blockchain algo, but instead of recieving newly created coins, thy only get the txs cost from that block?

im with ya, the reason i laughed at this one is, the silver lining that, even after all this carnage,  bitcoin wins the war...
