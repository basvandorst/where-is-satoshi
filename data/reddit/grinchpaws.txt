I bought a couple bitcoins when they were cheap to play on an online poker site.  I held onto them even when bitcoins were over $1,000.  In hindsight, I should have sold them, but they are worth a couple hundred now.  Really hope OpenBazaar takes off and bitcoins go up again.

Hmmm, I wonder if you can make money being a professional OpenBazaar implementor?

That interviewer handled that well.  That Ver guy saying he's a self-made millionaire, as if that legitimizes his scam.  Past success does no guarantee of future results.

Won't any cryptocurrency have high fees if they get as popular as Bitcoin?

You have to think like a poker player.  They don't care about the money, just try to make the best decision, at the time.  If you think about the money, you will play scared and actually lose more money.

My life philosophy is, "Get rich or die tryin", from the master philosopher himself, 50 Cent.

According to Google he paid $22 million to get his bankruptcy case dismissed.  He got rich and didn't die tryin.  God bless him.

Those are only the ones that got caught.  In Madoff's case they had to be beaten over the head repeatedly until they did something.

I thought I had lost my private key as well but luckily found a backup print out lying around.  It was only a couple bitcoins though.
You can't really beat yourself up over it though.  No one at the time thought bitcoin would get this high.  I only own a couple coins because I bought some to play on an online poker site and forgot about them.

I miss Seals With Clubs.  It was the only real money poker site with an Android app.  The new SWC is a shadow of it's former self.  
I'll always be grateful to them because they were the only reason I bought a couple bitcoins for $60 a piece.

If I had any guts I'd sell some now and buy back after it drops but I'll just wish I had and live with the regret.

Back when Bitcoin his around $1K, I printed multiple copies of my key and stored them in various safe places.  One at work, one in my car, one in my fireproof safe and one in my IRL wallet.  Fast forward a couple years and I didn't pay much attention to Bitcoin until it started going back up.  I went looking for my key and seemed to have lost every single copy, probably from moves and cleaning.
I tore my house up looking for it.  For a couple months, I kicked myself until I remembered the one in my fireproof safe and, low and behold, the last copy was sitting there in all its glory.  
Reminded me of that scene in Pulp Fiction when they open the mysterious briefcase and the gold light shines in their face.
There is really no foolproof safe place to store your key.  Everything has a risk, you just have to find the solution with the least amount of risk.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:14:04
I did that and lost all copies.  Luckily found the last copy in my fireproof safe.

Until my mom starts using bitcoin, it ain't going anywhere near that anytime soon. The only way she is going to use bitcoin if she is forced to use it or doesn't know she is.  No way she is dealing with a bitcoin wallet and public/private keys.  Maybe our generation and prior will use it.

How can another currency take over?  Bitcoin is far and away the most well known cryptocurrency out there and getting mainstream people to accept Bitcoin is a major hurdle let alone another with zero brand recognition.
