With every new paycheck I’m always buying bitcoin. I trust Tim Draper’s prediction of 250k in 2022.

I’m telling all my buddies to buy bitcoin, but they’ll rather get a loan for a new car or go out and party and spend it on dumb shit. I guess they never heard of depreciating assets. I’ll stick with my 15 year old car kkthanksbye. To the moon!!!!! �� ��

I’m starting to use cash app to buy bitcoin, and then just transfer them to my ledger wallet. The only thing is there is a cap of $2,500 per day/$5,000 per week to withdraw. Oh and you can only buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin per week
