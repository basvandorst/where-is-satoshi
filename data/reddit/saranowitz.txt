Of course it has. That's exactly what penny stocks are.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:31:13
I’m so sorry for your loss. Best of luck to you and your family.
Echoing everyone else here: do not trust anyone you don’t know personally.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:39:26
No, this is a panic sell-off. There are a LOT of people selling because they are afraid right now. In the stock market all trading would be shut down after losses this bad. It’s not just going to heal itself in a couple of hours. The prices are going to need to be so low that smart investors pick at the bones of what’s left and buy up enough to send the speculation soaring again.

Pretty much summarizes this subreddit’s behavior in general
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:43:21
It's not about being sacred or not. I don't want someone to blame me for fucking up their life. This barber does not have disposable income and shouldn't be making speculative investments in a market they know 0 about. And when they inevitably lose their investment, I'm going to get blamed.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:43:50
I am happy that others are interested. I don’t want to be bothered helping a stranger make a risky financial decision that could potentially destroy his life. If he doesn’t know what bitcoin is it’s not my place to advise him whether he should be putting next month’s rent money into it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:22:21
Jesus christ. And who are they buyers that will be buying in at those ridiculous prices?
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:53:50
Chaum is satoshi confirmed
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:43:31
If you honestly think this crash will not have spooked people enough that it’s simply going to rise back up to $20k in a couple of months, you are delusional. That’s not a healthy outlook. This is an over-correction from a period driven by greed and investors who had no clue what they were doing. It will take a long time to heal and restore investor confidence.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:10:47
Not at this level of mass media visibility it hasn't. It was a get rich quick dream for lower/fixed income people first learning about it from news reports on it's rise. Guess what they are going to be reading about tomorrow? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:45:33
Smart move. I made the mistake of discussing it with my barber of all people and now he is calling me for alt coin tips
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:57:30
Best of luck to you! What service was this on so I know to avoid it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:15:22
If the value constantly rises then how will it be used for transactions? If I am a seller of goods I will not want to risk accepting unstable currency
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:11:51
Read it again, slower this time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:03
I don't think that was legit trading price though. Coinbase went down and people couldn't buy, driving the demand higher in other places.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:21:54
Well we're at 600,000 right now - and our growth has been a hockey stick. It's not implausible that we could see 1 million by mid year, maybe even 2 million subscribers by september.

Uh dude. Remove your support ticket number you idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:17:13
BECAUSE OF THINGS!!!
nah, I'm not angry. Just pointing out how ridiculous some of the comments in the thread about knowing when to sell are. Not aimed at yours per se.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:51:17
Investing $289,000 to cash out $8,000 profit (less taxes and fees!) is incredibly dumb from a risk to reward ratio. More likely that person got cold feet and regretted investing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:13:07
:Shrug: great time to buy
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:00:39
If makes no sense to use a currency that will triple in price over a short amount of time to buy a cup of coffee. It's the equivalent of paying 3X what the coffee is worth.
If you had two stores next to each other selling identical coffee with identical experiences, and one charged 3x more than the other, there's no way you'd go to the store that charged more. And if you say otherwise, you're not being truthful.
So why is it different with Bitcoin? Whenever I see someone posting about spending Bitcoin to buy beer or coffee I just think they are foolish.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:13:30
To be transactable it has to be stable or no one will accept it. And if it’s stable then further speculative investment in it is pointless because it cannot appreciate further. It’s being hyped up by press and mainstream attention and the value will go higher. But anyone holding past 100k expecting it to be worth more does not understand the purpose and value of crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:58:11
Well they do no need to buy (and sell) bitcoin when the contract comes due, at the agreed upon contract price. So yes, one party will have an active stake in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:41:19
Thanks, I bought around the same price as you and sold some off around $2000 and $5500 respectively (and then reinvested the proceeds in ethereum, oops).
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:00:11
Congrats! What did you buy in at?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:41:22
I remember it like it was only days ago
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:45
If I were Coinbase, I'd be out raising a couple billion dollars right about now to boost security and reliability forever. And then prepping for my IPO.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:15:44
That's a well explained response, thanks. 
The major difference is that transferring Bitcoin between USD carries large fees. 
Assuming you *need* to buy coffee and will have to spend one of your carried currencies on it, it makes more sense to use your stable USD and hoard your volatile and potentially lucrative BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:45:58
Be aware that you (probably) pay taxes and (definitely) pay fees on each transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:17:30
Expect to see more of this.
I'm glad that you found forward thinking places though. Unfortunately, those are going to be fringe exceptions until it stabilizes.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:20:32
That's true. OK fine. I will donate 2,000 fake reddit accounts to a children's hospital of your choice, if the number of subs doesn't reach 1 million by June 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:24:38
And How the hell would you know how to time it right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:13:21
When it's pricing at $25000+ you won't feel so bad anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:46:19
Same boat. For what it's worth, I don't think it actually was at $18.9k. I think it was inflated by a couple of massive bank transactions. And had it actually hit that price would have resulted in an instant sell off.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:48:23
Congratulations to you! I'm really happy to hear that everything worked out and on your holiday no less. That's truly special and I'm very happy for you guys! Go do great things with the funds. The world needs more people like you. :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:07:38
Sure. If it always increases in value. But then as a buyer I'm *never* going to want to spend that currency.
Anyways, it's a moot point because cryptocurrencies dont just raise in value.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:11:44
Tireless advocate and educator on all things bitcoin. Very likely that a significant percentage of bitcoin investors were initiatally educated by his videos and posts. So he is responsible for more adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:18:50
Yes. Forget about the price of bitcoin. Focus on the percentage return it is yielding. At a 20% daily return your money would be worth $360 (minus taxes and transfer fees) after one day.
That of course assumes the price continues moving up at this past weeks Rate. Don't be Invest what you can't afford to lose
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:52:11
They probably walked away with $4,000 in profit after taxes and fees, assuming a US citizen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:10:05
His bio explains it. He didn't have money to invest at the time.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:05:09
Whew! Really happy for you guys. Please do keep me posted on which app it was
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:08:56
exactly. And that's terrible for the economy.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:17:00
Did you read the post? We're already at 600,600 today.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:23:31
You are awesome! Question: why not wait a bit longer until the price of BTC goes even higher. Presumably the impact you can make on charities will be even more dramatic.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:04:24
Kind of hope so. I want to buy some more at $10K.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:05:23
Please call the police immediately
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:28:51
No $$. Nobody could process that much currency if it was in the billions 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:31:27
When that dip goes another $2000 lower and you are thankful you were forced to wait
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:23:09
What about gdax? Same company but low fees
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:27:58
Trust me you don’t want it to go lower. Once trust erodes it’s hard to return
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:45:11
if you pass the 10k mark (and we will), you are guaranteed to go back under the 10k mark again at some point. Whether it's some other crypto contender, or loss of faith due to bad pr (hacking/govt interference) or some other factor, markets will be markets.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:43:36
Yes, except you are never going to convince 10,000 anonymous unaccountable people to put the needs of the masses above their own. Greed and fear are always going to get in the way.
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:32:12
I just sold at $6k each. I'll buy back during the next fluctuation. ~~Unlike stocks there are no long-term capital gains benefits to simply holding, so~~ you can derisk and make a lot more money by buying and selling at preset peaks and valleys.
I have more than 200x'd my original investment by this method.
That's not a typo: 20,000% profit.
EDIT: removed my horribly misinformed factoid. Thank easypak-100
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:37:27
That’s what people thought about $7500 last week.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:00:36
jesus christ. that's not how it works. Everyone wants it to move up and to the right. But it's going to be a slog. And if it's not a slog, then it's being overhyped and is going to crash when the dumb money panics.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:01:43
do you think the big players are suddenly going to stop manipulating it?
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:07:18
Oops. TIL. Thanks, that's probably a better thing to be aware of now then before I file taxes. :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:59:32
Don't base investments on patterns. There's a reason casinos show the roulette history - they want you to draw predictions from noise.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:49:16
Point wasn't to brag, but just to say that you can squeeze more juice from your profit by waiting for natural fluctuations in price. BTC is really volatile, which presents easy opportunities.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:40:26
Not when you're trying to get mainstream adoption. Non-savvy investors will be afraid of losing their money if the price continues to plummet.
