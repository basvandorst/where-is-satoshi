I was asking myself the same thing. Why it takes so long to release something that should be already developed?
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:07:22
It's Electrum 3.0.5 to download, not 3.0.3 for important security reasons. Pls update! 
Awesome guide anyway.

I can't link my VISA from Italy, neighter bank account. So i really prefer to use bitcoin exchanges like Bitstamp or Kraken to buy, even because they have much lower fees.  Sorry but for now i don't see advantages of using circle from here.

Bitcoin of course
@_date: 2014-07-05 07:35:03
The difference is that with Cex.io you can always sell your GHS so you don't lose the starting investment or you partially lose it.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:41:20

@_date: 2014-07-25 06:14:44

What is this shit?
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:53:14
Very nice you are travelimg to Italy mate. I'm italian. I love bitcoins, but sorry, i'm worried that you will not find many places to spend your bitcoins here. Even if there are some merchant accepting them. Take a look at coinmap.org. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:04:30
Well yes, and in August there will be much more I think, moreover in Rome. Don't forget to wear a bitcoin t-shirt :) it could be useful
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:51:11

No. I'm serious
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:35:10
Trezor and trezor staff sucks!!! My trezor was stolen during the shipping way due to their very bad package and i never have been refunded!!! They continue to say that don't care. Don't buy trezor please. Trezor company is like MtGox!
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:55:52
Definitely yes
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:53:23
Ledger! Trezor's assistance sucks
@_date: 2019-11-09 09:12:31
What a ��
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:23:53
Absolutely not! is has been stolen because the package was very bad. The same thing happened to a friend of mine with an Amazon's object. They gave a total refund to him.
@_date: 2017-01-07 13:03:03
Did you read whay i have written? Their shipping package sucks! It's the worst package i have never seen. I was expecting at least a more strong package. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:05:17
@_date: 2017-01-14 12:15:08
Breadwallet for ever. Trezor shipping package sucks and so their help desk.
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:30:41
If you need Italian and English speakers, I'm in.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:33:21
Me! A very very very big crash!! Of the USD.
@_date: 2017-01-09 13:20:52
There are many way to make the shipment much more secure. For example, they can use a colored box where is much more simple to see a cut, not the white box they used. Also i would not write over the box "buyTrezor.com" better an anonimous one.  
If you know those problems you should suggest only 
courier shipments to your customer.
You must also think a way to make trezor not usable if it is stolen during the shipment!
I suggested a lot of this kind of possible improvements. They said thanks and nothing else.
This is the difference between them and companies like Amazon. 
BuyTrezor is greedy, Amazon will refund you!  
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:29:16
I talked with them and they remember me a lot MtGox! Buy a ledger or use electrum is the best.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:09:47
They are disgusting and greedy. I bought a trezor paid almost 0.19 btc. It has been stolen during the shipping. Trezor denied me any form of refunds! Pls buy a ledger, leave that trezor shit.
@_date: 2016-12-12 19:35:40
BitFlyer is Japanese, not Chinese.
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:39:25
My trezor was stolen before to arrive in my hands. No refund, never again trezor. Nano much more better.
@_date: 2016-12-13 00:07:20
I bought a trezor. Very poor package, i received it but the content has been stolen during the shipment. After 6 weeks no refund yet. 
Very very bad experience. I lost more than 100$.. paid with btc.
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:10:19
SEC? What is SEC? Lol
@_date: 2016-12-13 00:17:50
Quality of the product nothing.. quality of the package shit. Company is responsible for the protection of the product. I never had problems with amazon for ex. , because they are very professional.
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:57:06
Exactly. The package has been cutted and the content stolen during the way to my house. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:41:08
You wanna say the 1 Milion club..
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:53:53

Trump? Is that a joke?! 
@_date: 2017-04-03 09:41:37
Buy a ledger. Better than trezor
@_date: 2016-02-17 11:09:17
i had the same problem. i solved using the change password link
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:52:11
Absolutely ledger
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:29:03
Trezor sucks
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:29:59
Very nice, but I'd like to see the 1 Milion Club: people owning 21 one Bitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:46:20
A fucking trezor when btc was at $700. Stolen during the way and no refund by trezor's arrogant people. Never again a trezor.
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:04:23
I hope so..
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:35:06
Bitstamp it's a good choice for you
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:33:59
The same here. 3 days and no response from them! And i made a domestic wire directly from Japan! Unbelievable
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:54:55
$100,000 will signal the end of the early adopter stage.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:39:06
Same experience here. I'm very disappointed.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:41:46
I really don't know why. I think they need to hire more people.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:39:39
We are talking of money here, not bad hamburgers.
@_date: 2017-07-13 10:24:17
Fucking genius!!!
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:50:31
Where is located your company?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:19:22
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:43:27
Of course not, bit that is a very good news anyway
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:30:19
They said they are following Bank of Italy's guidelines..
@_date: 2015-02-20 00:12:04
Simply buy darkcoins from any altcoins exchange, then buy again bitcoins , then poker..
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:29:45
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:00:04
What the shit article is this?
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:30:00
I'm going to consider it.. i already learned from MtGox ;)
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:31:28
A revolution
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:19:28
Maybe it's time to start using Bittrex?!
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:58:16
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:28:06
For me instead Trezor stolen during the way and no refund!
Ledger forever
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:33:49
They are so stupid
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:15:10
Lol right. Don't worry, there are a lot of merchant and restaurant already accepting Bitcoin here
