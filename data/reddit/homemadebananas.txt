Windows is sending my text input to Google Chrome right now, halp.

That can easily happen but I always try to make sure I keep it to a minimum, otherwise it's going to be too much to think about and harder to focus on what I'm trying to solve. I would get so confused with that many tabs open.

Why use Bitcoin for that?

I don't think many people would think that's a reasonable price for a simple piece of hardware. Are they trying to beat Texas Instruments on over charging for things?

You can measure the value of currency in comparison to other currencies. Of course it can.
@_date: 2017-01-31 20:29:18
I don't think it would have any value if people didn't use it for everyday things ever.

Looks like it's from Google.

They take old bills out of circulation, but your money doesn't suddenly become invalid.

That doesn't help without the knowledge that we have now, about what's possible.

Some of the delivery services where I live take cards with Square or something similar. Does Square just not care, or how do they get away with it?

Think of it like an online resume. Don't lie, just try to show yourself in the best way you can.

Corporations are legal persons in that if you were to sue for something, you would sue the company and not anyone that works for it, and that they pay taxes as a separate entity before paying anyone. People hear "corporations are people" and loose their mind without knowing about corporations work and what that means. That's just what it's called how corporations are separate legal entities from their shareholders or employees.

It will work with the adapter that comes with the iPhone. The newer version of the square reader for chip cards is wireless anyway.

Do you think "stress testing" credit card transactions would cause any problems?

That's why I've just been using Defender for years.

But do enough people use ad blockers for it to make any sense in practice? You could measure with a little JS how many people have ads blocked easily and find out, but I'm guessing for most sites the answer is no. Maybe sites that more technical people visit mostly would be different.

I'll install some software on a Raspberry PI to save like $100, and end up with the same thing, I was in the market for this. Someday I hope that installing software is such a burden that paying for that makes sense.

Everybody knows that SWIM == me, anyway.
@_date: 2015-03-27 19:55:03
I don't think you even need to do that. They aren't going to open up a normal looking letter.

If it only makes most of what you pay in electrical costs then how could the business make any money? It would only make sense if it makes more than the electrical cost and the company pays for how much it uses. Unless I'm really misunderstanding.

You can get it free for one year if you have Windows 7 (once upgraded it lasts forever), but there's no limitation for Windows 8 users.

It seems really dumb for them to use Coinbase, even if their business is legitimate in state.

What? How is that possible if the bitcoins were really in cold storage? Somebody would have to have access to that private key somehow.
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:48:42
It's just that things should be designed so you don't have to use them in some convoluted, unintuitive way. There's no technical reason why it should be complicated, just bad design.
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:52:39
I'm curious, how would that allow somebody to find the private key?

What's to stop some psycho from putting toxins in drugs you buy on the street? Not much more, but there are no public online reviews for street dealers. The likelyhood of somebody doing that though is slim, because why would you kill somebody who could be a return customer? If you're an established vendor, chances are you're not going to suddenly go psycho and want to kill all of your customers. It's a good anti-drug story but not something that would likely happen in reality. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:30:27
It looks like they pay the business to deliver it as normal for you.
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:17:22
You'd scan it in your bitcoin wallet, and nothing would happen if it isn't a valid bitcoin address. If it's a web address nothing would happen, right?
@_date: 2015-02-22 06:30:08
I think you tell them what you want, and they find somewhere that will mail or deliver it to you.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:36:21
How do they identify some address as being the one somebody that sells drugs is using to collect funds? Would they have to go there and buy some weed, and then see where the funds end up?
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:24:30
How can Coinbase tell what you used your coins for? Wouldn't this thing be able to generate a new address each time, so they can't tell what it's being used for?
@_date: 2015-02-22 06:48:51
I guess if they can't find any way to get somebody else to do it, then it doesn't work.
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:45:57
Maybe PCP isn't a good idea.
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:23:39
I can't tell which is which.
