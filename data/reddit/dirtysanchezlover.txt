I clicked the faq on the right sidebar and found it within 10 seconds. Why can't you?
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:25:56
You mean chef i think. You actually might be legit but with your current username you won't get a lot of donations i'm afraid.

The sudden massive increase in volume on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges was completely unexplainable. There was no rise in client downloads in China. There was no rise in Bitcoin search volume on Baidu. There was no rise in Bitcoin visits on the Chinese Wikipedia. There was no Chinese bubble. You can all look this up for yourself, and you'll see that I'm right.
I don't need to look it up to know you are completely talking out of your ass. Fucking idiot. 
How the fuck can you write stuff like this? Why don't YOU look it up yourself? Be prepared to feel real stupid.

Ok do this. Start a new thread with a picture or 2 of the orphanage in combination with your username or some other kind of proof. 
I'm sure that works better than "hi i'm jusy cock please send some money". 
If this is real then these kids deserve presents and it would be a shame to have this fail because of bad communication.

The mods made several rules. One of them is this one: News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
The funny thing is every day there are several people who say fuck it, these rules don't apply to me. You are obviously one of them. 
What makes you so special? Care to explain?
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:52:09
What the fuck do you think that search bar to your right does!
@_date: 2013-11-01 00:24:04
So how am i able to find this within seconds using the search?
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:19:29
Come on man! This has been asked and answered so goddamn many times before. Just use the damn search!
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:40:29
You must be slightly retarded if you can't see how it can be used for money laundering. Or think it doesn't happen. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 08:58:45
Stop fucking reposting old news! Just stop it! How fucking hard can it be not to repost something?
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:13:36
Stop the fucking reposts!
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:23:47
Stop fucking making threads about them all day long. We see 10 threads a day about them how they suck. Just stop fucking using them! Problem solved!
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:30:00
Look at the damn sidebar! Jesus!
Question  today that didn't need to be posted. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:47:40
Look at me! I'm 16, i own 0.6 bitcoin and i can type FUCK PAYPAL in caps. Which makes me crazy cool!
Funny how you edited your post after i posted this. Sad. Your edit: spelling should say edit: completely different post because i realized how dumb i looked. 
Also funny how now i'm of course an evil Paypal supporter in the eyes of you morons. 
Just keep downvoting you dumb fucking kids. It will go away like it never happened and you can be safe in Bitcoin fantasy land again. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:12:59
Fuck me. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 00:47:20
ELI5 why you people REFUSE to use the search? Why? 
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:14:56
Use the goddamn search! This is answered about 80 times already! Just fucking stop already!
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:37:35
You forgot to mention the 100 thousands of times Paypal wins over Bitcoin. Retarded topic title. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 00:22:04
This has been asked and answered so goddamn many times! Why do you people REFUSE to use the search?
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:01:09
Yes we know. Because it's been posted many times already! Stop the fucking reposts! How fucking hard can it be!
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:19:42
Stop answering to these people. Let them use the search. It's all been explained a 100 times already. It has to stop at one point. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:54:36
Ah, exactly the type of answer i expected. 
"I don't have to stick to the rules because in my case it's different". 
Just like the 10 other people a day who post off topic links. You are all special. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 09:18:06
Tons of people bought under 50 and sold for profit. Weird question. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:48:37
Do a fucking search man! Why ffs do you people refuse to use the search? Why? Explain it to me!
@_date: 2013-11-01 01:27:45
Use the damn search! There are about 100 topics that answer your question!
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:12:43
Looks legit. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:48:46
Sure. But you must be slightly retarded if you can't see how it can be used for money
 laundering. Or think it doesn't happen.
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:31:29
At the fucking sidebar or the search to your right!
When will this ever stop
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:58:55
Yes we know. Because it's already posted severl times. 
You must have noticed the insane amounts of reposts. So why when you post something do you refuse to do a search first so you won't be one of those annoying pricks?
Is it arrogance? You simply think your link wasn't posted already? Are you special?
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:06:30
Yes, it gets asked a lot. Like 20 times a day a lot. You already suspected this yet you refused to use the search. Why?
@_date: 2013-11-01 00:18:30
Use the damn search! It's there for a reason!
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:10:04
Haha wtf? It's so easy i'm not even gonna bother explaining it. 
I can't believe you seriously think this is not possible. I can't think of a better currency to do this with than Bitcoin. 
I take my words back. I don't think you're slightly retarded. You are fully retarded.
