Does this story seem to anyone else like a paid advertisement for that wristband? It wouldn't have even prevented the theft described in the article.

Your post is meaningless. What measures do you propose to stop speculation?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:49:55
we already have libertybit.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:41:59
those are triple digits.

You can't assign cause and effect here. The lag could have started because people started selling in large numbers driving down the price.

This is retarded. The change since it was at $266 only matters to those who bought at $266. Why not measure how much value was created since 30 days or 1 year ago?

no internet? so you want someone to give you a call?
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:45:38
would this work even taking into account service fees and bid/ask spread?

Scary thing is there are probably browser exploits out there that can install hidden remote control software after visiting a bad web site.

I would like to see some supporting evidence that this pattern actually indicates anything. These guys are like fortune tellers. Guess a direction and 50% of the time you'll be right.

Is this place trustworthy? who is behind it?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:48:30
This is spam
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:55:28
It's the bid/ask spread. The $90 orders were market sells while the $99 was a market buy. You can't draw any conclusions from these small fluctuations.

A few large holders of bitcoins recognized that the time was ripe and started pumping bitcoin on various message boards, media outlets etc. Just look at stock market forums for examples. They sold for profit and are now staying silent or reversing their message to push the price down. When things have settled down they will buy more BTC and repeat.

libertybit will allow up to $500 deposits via interac e-transfer.

maybe the first rounds of production are not being sold to the public. If you're producing something that's guaranteed to generate money, why would you give it away?
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:18:30
also exists.

There is no rationale, just stories to support wishful thinking.

Hey at least it was only $3K. there are people who bet their life savings, house, car etc on speculative stock market investments if not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:33:06
I hope more people do this. It could raise the volume and liquidity on smaller exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:01:15
How many bitcoins per week would you expect to make with a single 6970?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:17:43
Are you suggesting the price will shoot back up? What makes you think so? 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:44:13
Easy, a large rise or drop in price would result in high trading volumes as people load or unload their BTC in response. High volume = high revenue from trading fees.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:38:19
Take advantage of it by buying BTC at a low exchange and selling at a higher exchange.
