First of all you need a Bitcoin Wallet! This is nothing else but an app that lets you send and receive bitcoins (similar to email, but with money instead).
Choose one!
Personally I'd suggest Mycelium for Android or Electrum for the Desktop.
There are of course, many other platforms and apps available. As far as I know, Hive might also be a good one. 
Also, personally I'd suggest using Bitcoin from your smartphone instead of the desktop. It is much more comfortable and secure.
**Next step** Once you've got your wallet, send bitcoins to it!
You can get bitcoins from tips on reddit, obviously, by selling stuff for bitcoins on the internet or buying them from exchange websites such as   or  (Circle accepts Credit Cards and can be set up in just a few seconds).
Once you've got the bitcoins in your wallet, just use them to pay for stuff. Usually it goes like this: 
1. Click on "Buy" button on the website.
2. Scan the QR code on the screen with your phone and hit Send. 
3. That's it. There's no step 3. 
Once you've got your first bitcoins I suggest  to try to make your first purchase as there is no minimum amount and it's really straight forward.

It didn't ask me for this, only for my birthday. I live outside the US. 
Where do you live?
Make sure you're not using a US proxy or VPS.

To understand this, for now, only take a look at the red half of the graphic.
Imagine yourself a room filled with people who want to sell Bitcoin and people who want to buy Bitcoin. The sellers will place an offer and the buyers can then decide if they accept the proposed offer. 
For example: 
Seller1: *I sell 3 BTC for $350 each!*  
Seller2: *I sell 10 BTC for $320 each!*  
Seller 3: *I sell 2 BTC for $310 each!*  
Since the buyers want to get the best deal, whoever wants some BTC will start buying at seller 3, once seller 3 is out of coins people will buy at seller 2 and once seller 2 is out of coins people will buy at seller 1. 
They do it in this order because they want to buy at the cheapest price. It doesn't make sense to buy coins for 350 when you can buy them at 310. Doing this is called "eating up the orders". 
Now, yesterday something impressive happened. Someone put up this order: 
Other sellers: *"We sell x BTC for* **more** *than $300 each".*   
Bearwhale: *"I sell 30.000 BTC for $300 each"*  
The Bearwhale had offered the lowest price. This meant that all buyers bought from him. This does also mean that until the Bearwhale was out of coins (which lasted a looong time) the price would not pass the $300 mark. 
When you draw this on a graph it actually makes a big vertical line which is called a "wall". Only if buyers "eat through" the wall, will the price increase. 
This is only the red part of the graphic. The green part is actually the same but in reverse. The green part represents a room of people where it's buyers who make offers and sellers decide to accept or not the offers.
The prices from both rooms will find a middle point and that is where both lines meet in the middle.

Bought $1 worth (just to try out a small amount) with a Visa Debit card outside the US.
Very fast, no problems.

I wish I could join de Microsoft party. 
I never thought I'd say this as I'm pretty satisfied with Android, but today microsoft has made me a little jealous of Windows Phone users and Xbox One users.

The LA used bookstore example is spot on.
