Seriously guys... double the performance of the Antminer S1 at the same price? 
They're only 28nm... I'm warning you, don't buy them... you'll never make your money back!
Even BFL's Monarch can do 600GH/s using 50 less watts and only costs $500 more... plus they deliver in 2* weeks!!!

53.475... which, in essence... is my kids college fund.
I really can't explain how I feel right now. something along the lines of sick, hollow, and heart broken. I get to tell my wife tomorrow that the +40k we had a month ago is now completely gone. I honestly don't know how I'm going to do it.
All in all 2014 has been shit. She had an Aunt die Jan 4th, an Uncle Die Feb 15th, an unexpected car repair for about a grand... and now this...
I don't ever ask for handouts... but in this case I'll make an exception. Anything helps.

I would definitely recommend talking to your General Practitioner if you're thinking about transitioning. but if your options are limited, then you do what you have to do. Financially, bitcoin has been a saving grace for me in this area. Depending on your situation, it's +/= 50k to and minimum of 2 years to transition (easily the most YMMV comment I ever made.)
A point to note, you have to live with yourself for the rest of your life, and if you're NOT happy where you are... then get yourself there. No "one" and no "thing" can replace true happiness within yourself and with yourself.

BFL offers 300 gh/s for $2240
Cointerra offers 1000 GH/s for $3500
Both in Janurary...
BFL can't math

Well, there are three things I would like to share with everyone who's mining.
1: The ace of my sleeve is the cheap ass power up in the Pacific Northwest. Other miners have to turn their GPU's off love before I have to. Invest in PV panels if you want to keep your GPU's running longer if you live in an area with high priced electricity. They will pay themselves off extremely quick.
2: If you mine at a loss even for a little but, the market has reacted quickly to make you profitable again... Even with ASIC's coming online, people are going to hold onto them to get a higher price. yes, a few miners will cash out to recoup costs... after that they'll either reinvest, or hold, (I'm sticking to 50% hold, 50% reinvest plan.)
3: Other alternative chains will crop up, most will be pump and dump, one or two might catch hold, who knows. What I do know is ASIC's can't mine anything other than SHA256 chains (maybe their derivatives, SHA512/1024/2048/ETC... increase the number of loops they do??? Who knows.) So GPU's will get a jump on these new chains and make money.
Just watch  and mine whatever is profitable. Everything I have is paid off except 2 7950's I bought this week, and I'll make back those 3 coins in a few days.
Happy Mining!

You missed a 0... only 50 Million by June, IF BFL doesn't ship.
Also, if a 30GH/s device, one that has a smaller node than anyone else (currently) and better $/Hash currently, how is it obsolete in 2 years? 
Even with GPU mining, I'm still profitable till almost 11 million, after that they start using more electricity then they make in BTC.
Then there's always LTC, but I'm not making an argument there...
Also I forgot, the higher BTC goes against USD, the longer GPU miners can stay in the game. Done with my .02c.

So if one of these is 75 for 10GH/s then
2.25 BTC for their 300MH/s USB miner?
@_date: 2013-03-03 22:48:31
    Node1 = 5830x2
    Node2 = 6950x1 (sold today for 4.70 BTC)
    Node3 = 5850x4
    Node4 = 5830x3,5850x1
    Node5 = 5850x3
    Node6 = 5830x3
    Node7 = 5830x4
    Node8 = Future Rig
    Node9 = Future Rig
    Node10 = 7970x2
    Nodejeff = 5830x1 (Customer of mine, He gets USD, I get BTC. WIN-WIN)
*  Nodes 1-7 = 890fxa-GD70, Sempron 145. 2GB Ram
*  Node10 = Asus Sabertooth X58, CoreI7 920 DO @ 4.2ghz, 12GB ram
*  NodeJeff = HP Dc7700, C2D 2.2ghz, 4GB ram
Not a lot, but I'm moving over to 7970's as I can get them, and saving for ASICs when they become available.
Edited to make it more readable.

Why the hell do you think they have computers such as Jaguar and Titan for. Damn sure it isn't weather tracking. I'm sure the horsepower they have in these data centers can easily deduct who's talking on the network in much less than a half hour, and it would be quite simple to do if you're calling someone who's on a carrier already back-doored by the NSA.
@_date: 2013-03-04 01:31:42
Also, if you live in a place with high electricity costs, (say California @ .30c KWH,) You'll be profitable at anywhere below 450M difficulty before you hit a 2 year ROI.

@_date: 2013-04-14 23:02:02
Also depends on what your $$$ per KWH is. I'm still profitable. :)
But yeah, I'm moving 20 some 58x0 cards to Litecoin next week.

Yeah see, I just claim anything I cash out as mining income. I only cash out enough to cover expenses and hold the rest. I don't think I have a coin that's 4 months old anyway... but whatever. If I hold a coin for a year how would they know anyway. What's the difference between a coin I mined in January vs one in November. 
Another thing, Who the hell would know if you convert Fiat to BTC THEN to LTC to &lt;insert altcoin here&gt; back to BTC for the capitol gains clock reset to kick in. Makes absolutely no sense.

You're absolutely true. But the market was pretty flat leading up to the BFL preorder opening... so I took a chance and spend 25 BTC to preorder one of their 4.5GH/s miners. What was $149 turned into $870.
Sold a couple laptops I had and paid for the upgrade via CC, not BTC. 
What hurt more was selling 90 BTC right before this huge rally in Janurary. That fucking hurts WAY more then the BFL preorder... but who knew?
Also, a fools bet? Ok... ??? I'll get my foot in on Avalon Batch 3 or BFL ships, either way, I'll be ahead.

So guess who used his credit card @ target recently. And guess who only went to target once in the past few months. And also who lost $2100 from his account this morning.
This guy.
So yes, I called the bank, I'm covered. Have to have a new card sent to me, file some paperwork to get some funds back, etc etc etc.
It's just fucking annoying at this point. But hey, I'm getting my money back.

I love threads like these. Please, I beg of you, get a refund and don't order. And I'll be LOLing my ass to the bank when they drop. Avalon, BFL, doesn't matter, and if you think for one second your ROI is going to take 2 years, please keep whatever you're smoking to yourself.
Here's a Hint.
Put your numbers in and see for yourself how much these things are going to make you. 
(Here's a hint, Difficulty needs to be AT LEAST 550 Million to see a 2 year ROI, anything lower than that and you see a faster return, that's calculating for the 30GH/s Mini Single.)
