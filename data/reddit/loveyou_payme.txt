A truly secure service would only store absolutely necessary data as a rule, and automatically remove it after it had served it's usefulness.
There is little reason to maintain records of messages between users beyond the sale.
Anyone truly concerned about the security of the site would have surely seen this.
And yet the FBI has messages from his account.

Good point.

I agree. I'm ostensibly skeptical as to how far the hidden services have been penetrated.
I find it hard to believe these agencies would unequivocally say "These are the ways to communicate on the internet that remain beyond our grasps". Given the recent revelations regarding forcing businesses to turn over SSH certificates and al of their efforts to the contrary. I mean, if they've just been having courts force SSH certs over, then they've had plenty of time to work on the few remaining sources of anonymity and privacy.

It never ceases to amaze me the types of people that get into crime.
If this is legit, he fucking admitted to one murder, while purchasing another, and then kept the record of the conversation stored on his servers.
Seems like a rookie mistake.
And then they track him down with good old fashioned police work? I mean, let's be honest here. Those are some glaring mistakes.

Especially if what they've said about how they located him is true.
We're led to believe they found him with normal police work. 
The real question is, are hidden sites compromised? 
If not, then that's a fair endorsement.
