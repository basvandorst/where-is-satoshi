Has there ever been a poll on this sub about how many people here actually own more than a day's paycheck worth of bitcoin? Looking at a lot of comments on that post about putting lottery winnings into Robinhood "bitcoin" actually surprised me with the level of militant ignorance. I was never expecting the highest degree of discourse here, but the pure stupidity I've seen from so many users across many posts here is quite stunning.

Turns out learning fake macroeconomics and fake monetary theory based on the Western establishment-backed narrative doesn't lead to understanding of real economics. Who knew?
As an aside, your IQ doesn't change while studying computer programming or economics, both math and logic-based, rather than narrative-based, fields.

Thanks for the laughs. I want to assume you're baiting but it seems unlikely given how many people are still deepthroating the economic narrative dictated by "academic" institutions, "financial" institutions, mainstream programming, and our benevolent and knowledgeable governments. Surely they can't all be wrong?

You're right, but even on this sub there is a stunning lack of knowledge of the world.

I agree with most of your points but the fact that voters don't technically have the power to fix things. As a collective, voters certainly have the *power* to change policies; it merely comes down to the fact that voters as a whole don't have the intelligence or free-thought to understand reality through the haze of brainwashing. In practical terms, I would agree that voters don't have that power because of the lack of ability.

Prepare for a roundabout deflection to your straightforward question, likely by arguing the fact that there are no objective "good guys". He's already pre-hedged by using quotation marks, but will have a tough time answering your simple question.

He's here to defend his ego-invested worldview based on the fake economics taught and propagated by Western neoliberal storytellers.

You're right in that avoidance of cognitive dissonance is a big part, but I still think you are vastly overestimating the ability of average people to analyze information and reason to their own conclusions.

I've been studying and following these fields for a long time, but only very recently started lurking some subs on Reddit. What's your take on the proportion of users on this sub who have some understanding of real economics and geopolitics and are intelligent enough to make rational arguments?

They very likely have been consistently purchasing for several years already, much like the tons (or rather, thousands of tons) of gold that they have purchased but not announced.

It's always funny when double digit IQs are so smug about their misunderstandings, thanks.

I completely agree with your first two paragraphs and most of your last. I was simply arguing the technicality that given a fully aware and rational electorate, democracy would actually be able to produce net positive outcomes. Of course, that premise is far from reality. Where we differ is that although I agree things would be improved with a more honest money system, that does not address other societal ills with other bases. There are other deep-seated issues that arise from different flaws in human psychology, which would require other complex solutions to alleviate.

No matter how many times I've seen it, the irony is thick enough that it still makes me laugh.

What is now commonly taught and sold as "economics" is certainly a social "science", obviously by design. It so happens that this "economics" taught at Harvard, Columbia, Florida State, printed and imparted as gospel in high school textbooks published by McGraw-Hill, accepted and implemented by the Federal Reserve and Western governments, implicitly legitimized by such things as the "Nobel Prize" and mainstream brainwashing, all rely on the exact same mathematically disprovable premises, and only differ in inconsequential "policies".


I'll just hope you're trolling here because if not, then not only do we have a different understanding of what "economics" is, but of what "logic" itself is, which (un)ironically would explain the difference in understanding of everything else.

Seems mostly accurate, but I'm pretty sure brontosaurus lays eggs.
