Been multiple posts about it. What more do you want? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:16:47
Spoken like a true dogecoin hodler. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:05:47
Certainly get a job. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:20:57
I always forget what a gaming community we have here on crypto until I see comments like this.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:16:28
haha pretty sure you could make a bear with that same sign but I enjoy the joke. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:55:08
Honestly made me get some chills. This guy is what I introduced my mother to so see can understand the power of this tech and start investing in it. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:23:09
If your in the game long enough and not a total idiot you'll be sitting in profits. Some people even take out initial investment, they must get the best sleep. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:37:47
I find it funny that people think because they invest into technology they are not looking for profits. Profits are the reward for taking risk with your money in new technology. If you want to invest into a shit coin you're just gambling. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:53:48
Here since November, 17. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:52:31
Thank you for your wisdom. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:18:41
Haha, easier to just ask somebody out in person. Like the good old days. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:18:55
Can we be a rock? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:01:40
I mean we are at 6% loss right now. I would not call that a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:27:24
I can also send it across the world for cheaper rates then western union. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:12:57
Tell that to people in Nigeria. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:11:34
I think we certainly shed some crappy investors today. It's like they don't bother to read anything about the coin they are putting massives amount of money into. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:24:21
The amount of bitcoin you buy at that moment is the amount you'll get when your money goes through. Worry not. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:28:01
Normally this means your credit card did not allow the payment to go through. Has happened multiple times to me. Call them and tell them you attempted those purchases. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 22:17:28
Drinking in parabolic waves. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:04:49
When you buy those dips and continue to hodl, it feels pretty awesome. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:07:12
Says 8% in 24hrs. 
I was looking at coinbase for the 6%. 
It was down 30% in the middle of the day and has since gone up.
I'd call that a correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:34:43
Hmm, Maybe I'm incorrect. I've never not seen it go up quickly unless the card declined it. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 22:54:38
Is it right when you make a good trade at somebody else's expense? What about people who dropped off btc at 19k? Do you think that wasn't the right thing to do? 
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:12:20
Alright so I'm pretty sure you're not aware of how markets actually work. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:28:32
I believe so. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:28:12
I'm a week or so away from having enough funds to hit that 1.0 mark. It's a pretty good feeling. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:32:50
Yea jesus. What a hard life. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:15:02
Download and find out. It will tell you if it's stopped anything.
@_date: 2018-05-13 11:53:42
Come for the money. stayed for the tech. But yea also money. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:30:22
I've been wondering how all those people are doing right now. Between the home second mortgage and the student loan kids. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:53:50
Twitter has been a shit storm. You forget there are plenty of other social media sites. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:31:49
Seeing how there is more than 21 million people, yes you are correct.
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:55:52
Any industry will attack their competition. That's nothing new. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 23:12:47
Bc they are kids. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 23:12:14
Somebody doesn't understand the history of markets. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:34:18
You say that. But do you mean it. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:40:15
One of the technologies main cores is benefiting people financially from supporting the network. People will always do shit for money and that's why this was such a great addition.  
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:44:07
It only takes one. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:41:04
How does one replace when they make there first million but only work a 60k yearly salary.  
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:15:30
But I put my house up at 19k! 
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:48:03
Either hold or find another market to trade. Really the way to go at the moment until we see 11k bitcoin again. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:29:02
Totally doesn't. Main point was in mining as you suggested. But they are only there for the money (at least the majority). 
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:46:47
That's a steep gamble that I'm not sure I want to take. If you do, go short if you make a good chunk of change. The business is booming and close to leveling out. There will be a lot to drop off when prices aren't what they where in the illegal days. I've been in the horticulture industry for a while and I guess that's my two cents.
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:41:31
Get all the devices to support the network!!! 
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:42:29
Get it where?
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:49:28
Buy gold, Buy crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:57:28
FUck it. Go homeless and HODL! 
@_date: 2019-02-27 20:00:22
You are looking at this at the wrong angle. Its not guys who like traps are gay. Its traps that are gay. Bc I agree with you on the other premise.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:06:19
And just like that u/schism1 crippling depression fades away in the darkness as a bitcoin meme was created. His eyes glistened with hope of the future about more bitcoin memes, but in all reality nothing could top this once in a lifetime meme.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:00:54
Internet is free, energy cost is included. So basically the hardware cost which right now seems to be 8 month payback. Certainly a risky move but if bitcoin continues to go up the payback will happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:34:30
Look at the calculators it seems that it will pull in 500ish a month. My idea here is long term holding onto the bitcoins that where mined and watch the value rise. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:51:38
I just moved a lot of BTC into litecoin. Going to switch back into during the crash! Let's go! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:26:45
This entire threat is internet gold money turning into reddit gold. 10k party for sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:49:35
Nice, I was waiting for a correction so I could buy into it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:30:25
Waiting for that to happen so I can buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:50:51
That was my face when I finally got into the game. Saw the crash and knew it was time to buy in. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:02:28
haha THis is fucking awesome. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:02:59
Yea still seems to be a gamble in my eyes. I'll stick with S &amp; p 500 vanguard and my modest gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:53:01
I'll wait for the coin to come back down before I get more. I hate black Friday.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:30:07
I think it's because everybody is expecting a correction at some point, so if you could get it for a better price before it shoots back up why wouldn't you. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:02:09
That is where I'm getting my figures from. It's about $70/month electric at $.08 Kw/H
Edit- From this [website](
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:56:53
Why most people think it's a reality is because of market fundamentals. They could be wrong but the possiabilitys are dwindling. There are some good classes online regarding TA and you can sharing your skills up while following traders.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:49:58
Best of luck not looking at it hourly 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:57:51
Get money together for the next correction. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 14:23:23
With dropping volume. A show that the trend is not being supported. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:59:22
Cursed meme. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:14:35
ok. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:57:23
I've learn a very important lesson about holding these last few days.... :(
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:59:03
Let's do it again in a week? 
@_date: 2018-03-21 11:40:37
I'm certainly there. I basically just stopped loss at what I've invested into this so far and am waiting right now. No fucks given as you like to say. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:07:15
You should definitely be holding gold. Bitcoin il n isnt proven itself like gold yet. Don't hedge all your bets on it. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:11:44
I joined Nov 2017 and I'm not scared. I've done enough research to see what is going on right now and where we will be heading. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:56:55
Crypto on exchanges is not your crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:41:03
I've moved the majority of my money into tether. I'm just waiting for some recovery and I'd like to see the future contracts have more longs vs shorts. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:04:00
When bitcoin has a multi trillion dollar market cap and doesn't move so rapidly it will become more of a currency. We are simply is growing pains. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:28:27
That was just utter nonsense. Feels like some solid ground this time. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:07:53
I'm just sitting here mining away. Low prices means less competition. I'm all for it. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 22:05:21
But it has no inherit value!!!!!!!!! I read the NY post article! Some tight logic. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:11:06
I'm putting in bi weekly. In split between wanting a bull run but also being able to buy at these prices. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:45:03
Chromosomes assign what sex you are. Male being attracted to another male is being gay. Change my mind.  
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:26:03
When they say no fluff they mean this article has very little information. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:02:25
It's the shit talk from Bcash. But yes I agree with you lets focus on something better
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:52:43
Hell if I trust that pump. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:07:54
What makes bitcoin from becoming obsolete to just another blockchain? Is blockchain not just the real tech? What makes bitcoin special in that regard. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:19:11
@_date: 2018-12-15 02:51:27
Explain what type and maybe you have an argument. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:33:22
Uhhh.. ok. You sound sane. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:18:06
Koch group? You said koch himself. And bc he is on the board of directors for one of his non-profits? Are you insane? 
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:36:11
You have any idea of what type of community surrounds bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:15:30
Of course. I lot of those people don't think a lot of that activity should be criminalized.
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:25:43
Downvoted for having questions. Nothing cult like about that. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:33:18
I've also seen this. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:06:50
They are not that hard to spot. When I started reading about people doing second mortgages I had a idea that we were in a bubble. After all of this I can see that I didn't sell because of greed and the what if. A very costly but seriously great lesson to learn. Onto the next bubble! 
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:45:15
I think it's his comic denying the holocaust. But yea sure.
