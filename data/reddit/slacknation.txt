 but this is not realtime
@_date: 2016-08-09 07:05:53
they should really sell, they screwed up, there is no way around that fact
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:58:40
not cso but shareholders since they are not shutting down
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:02:45
that means client money never goes into liquidation in case the company does bankrupt
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:17:02
well, ppl gonna defend for the method that they get minimum loss
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:12:31
yah man, i heard they were increasing fees
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:22:23
investigation is already going, so if u want to sue purely to start investigation then it is pointless. see the investigation report and sue if u're not happy
@_date: 2016-08-10 12:00:29


@_date: 2016-08-04 08:03:28
if bigwigs like coinbase, bitpay, cumberland have lost bitcions, we might get a bailout!
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:40:20
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:41:15
too bad bitgo was sleeping on their job too
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:20:15
frankly u will have a hard time winning in court vs some big wig which had fiat in bfx and wants it back
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:47:23
what if u could 3x that upside potential
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:50:02
but if they have signed $50million of tx out of their system in such a short time, then their processes is definitely not good enough
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:19:40
damn, if kraken had a trading engine like bitfinex
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:40:25
could be as easy as bitgo not signing those tx
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:02:31
could be a compromise of the backend without the possession of the private key itself
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:33:46
yah but that would mean the lender doesn't lose their bitcoins, then who lose? this is a case the insurance company bankrupt lol
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:44:22
no solution will make everyone happy unless someone comes up with 70m
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:06:37
this is more a custodian model than a bank, a bank nv holds full reserve.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:05:08
in that case i don't think bfx will compensate u using their own money let alone asking other clients to compensate u
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:20:41
in this case, each account had their own btc wallet, btc was not commingled
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:36:36
that depends on their company structure, most companies will have a 100% owned subsidiary carrying client funds so they are protected
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:33:01
if u're rich, go make a deal with bfx, i don't think courts can make u more money out of this
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:55:56
more likely a lot of sellers at first
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:24:13
indeed, i would say it's a wrong move if they're now trying to buy bitcoins in the market without client's consent
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:42:11
because need to trade
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:59:00
having a subsidiary to hold client assets is a very common practice across many industries in fact not having one is more fraudulent 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:11:13
if bfx token price collapse 50%, we still get 18% more back!
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:12:52
it isn't pure luck, fiat/bitcoin/eth had obvious different risk factors to loss
@_date: 2016-08-10 09:33:27
hmm, their lawyers better be ready
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:07:52
that is not enough, u need to know the balances add up, which bitfinex had in place
@_date: 2016-08-20 13:01:51
wait, u can use this to convert bitcoin to cash? wow
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:56:48
it depends whether they did sign the hacker's tx or not, since bitfinex stores all their wallets with bitgo, this was a big withdrawal out of bitgo wallets and should have raised a red flag
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:18:08
is your goal for only bitcoin holders to take the loss or something else?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:43:37
more like sort out bitgo
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:06:34
88% of the money are corporate users, we will get bailed out!
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:09:37
i like the comparison of safe deposit more. bitcoin is a safe deposit in brazil while fiat is a safe deposit in us. if your items are lost in the brazil safe deposit do u expect to be compensated from other safe deposit users in us?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:01:05
it's a multi sig, so a call to bitgo should have stopped all tx
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:05:57
who is gentlemen?
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:14:15
i wouldn't see a single point of failure as a more secure solution, in this case 2 parties failed
@_date: 2016-08-14 09:11:41
take over bitgo's clients!
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:58:25
whoa bro, do u work for bitgo?
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:09:23
my guess is the tx were created by bfx, bitgo only signs but doesn't create tx, so it can be quickly known that bfx got hacked but of course bitgo had weak processes that enabled signing of hacker's tx 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:39:53
not enough coins there, oops
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:13:14
at least let me copy and paste the address man
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:43:53
oh wait, that means those lending out fiat going to lose money, potentially worse legal position since fiat is commingled unlike bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:38:16
he does have at least 424,424 bitcoins at one point
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:52:34
not bad, better ps skill needed
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:00:47
if u're a business, managing client bitcoin wallet is not a trivial task
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:25:44
most likely not, but just wait for news
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:09:15
lax bro, just different views since much of this are just emotion driven
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:37:58
i think the main question is how many bitcoins did they have at bitfinex
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:01:51
that is more applicable to say if their site is down and u lost money because u can't trade. they should be liability for loss of client funds but of course even if u sue them they might have no money to pay. best way is to avoid the courts and they work out a good solution for most
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:59:35
looks like bitgo automates and doesn't raise red flags, so a compromise on bitgo not needed
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:05:54
looks like a troll face lol! signs hacker's tx and says it's what bfx want
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:11:18
frankly the difference u get will all be lost due to time and legal fees. in fact it isn't high chance u will win
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:11:09
i would say yes, not sure where their value add comes in if they sign hacker's tx
@_date: 2016-08-09 06:14:58
looks like a good deal for the overall community, hope bfx shareholders will make sensible decisions. a new shareholder and management team can easily bring bfx up again and retain most clients
@_date: 2016-08-09 06:28:59
it should only be usd in your exchange wallet, not trading and funding
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:11:23
hmm then y bitgo wasn't working?
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:19:16
lol how is the one being left going to be made whole? lawsuits don't print money
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:06:15
post in reddit, they reply faster
@_date: 2016-04-29 03:01:11
use an exchange, way way cheaper
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:03:48
bro, suing doesn't create money out of thin air in fact it sucks money from everyone
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:14:28
not sure how they structured the company, but clients assets shouldn't have been under their exchange's balance sheet. in this case u can sue their exchange for the loss but u can't expect them to pay u using other clients money
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:26:01
if u think using the courts is the best way out, go take a look at mark karpeles. try to get your whale friends and negotiate with bfx would be good
@_date: 2016-08-02 07:16:40
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:17:50
this is no comparison to mtgox, there was no separate of mtgox and client money
@_date: 2016-08-19 06:42:49
when was bitcoin hacked?
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:05:47
looks like u're rich but it is unlikely u can crawl other client money to compensate u, else bitfinex will just spend all the client money to hire lawyers, does it make sense? u might want to work out a private deal with bfx which should be more beneficial to all
client funds are not supposed to be under bfx's balance sheet, if it is u can directly sue them for fraud
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:38:58
cftc case was from a long time ago, only much later they got fined
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:56:51
bitcoin wallets are not commingled 
@_date: 2016-04-14 08:56:37
too bad all tx on bitcoin can't be chargedback and there are no regulators to guard bitcoins, oh wait it's a real physical company with humans
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:10:02
@_date: 2016-04-07 17:28:05
no currency, no blockchain, no whitepaper, no code
@_date: 2016-04-01 18:18:26
april's fools! people only take your money and don't give u goods never the other way round
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:04:31
if that case u can sue them for your lost bitcoins, the guy above was trying to sue them so fiat users in bfx compensate bitcoin users which i'm pretty sure will only make lawyers rich
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:15:51
hmm, their bitcoins are secured by bitgo, i guess a whale's account got hacked? or maybe they got sub peona.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:07:45
i seldom had fast withdrawals from bitfinex, and always get the response that it might take 24 hours, so actually bitfinex wasn't that bothered with limits it seems
@_date: 2016-04-24 07:44:04
given a long enough timeline, they can all be recovered
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:24:03
even hot wallets are secured by bitgo
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:10:00
guys, the cavalry is here.
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:39:41
lol, don't u worry about vc money. 21 do mining too
@_date: 2016-04-22 07:18:20
should repost that in case someone else receives that email too
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:12:49
should be 10%
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:08:23
you have a lot of inputs in your tx
@_date: 2016-04-30 07:17:13

@_date: 2016-04-15 06:45:17
i need to hear the sound it makes
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:14:35
if everyone just signs without looking, then u don't need a multisig
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:27:25
some pictures of everyone working!
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:49:54
eh, use coinbase.com, region locked though 
@_date: 2016-04-19 09:06:45
what! more than 2mb? lol
@_date: 2016-04-17 07:41:46
in simple terms, these 2 are not comparable, aws can't hash efficiently like mining asic and mining asic can't perform computing like aws. a better comparison would be the cost to build aws vs cost to amass mining asic to get today's hashrate
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:41:02
the golden shower, it has been a really long time my friend
@_date: 2016-04-25 18:00:03
they return u the bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-04-17 08:24:15
no. u need approval from them to move your coins lol. use copay.io
@_date: 2016-04-27 13:24:52
it's a squeeze on over leveraged longs, can't bring everyone to the moon u know
@_date: 2016-04-22 16:42:50
nsa is a bitcoin early adopter, hehe

@_date: 2016-08-09 06:10:25
indeed, if they resume operation and bitcoin gets hacked again then haircut for all again? doesn't quite make sense
@_date: 2016-04-10 17:06:51
i wouldn't care since i'm not the one paying
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:17:29
what is the non slippage high we reached? lol
@_date: 2016-04-22 16:44:03
so are we lucky we have china miners?
@_date: 2016-04-10 06:44:34
just google hex to string converter
@_date: 2016-04-28 17:51:14
wouldn't have expected less from them
@_date: 2016-04-26 14:26:56
easier for businesses to use so hopefully they can concentrate on new products instead of regulation
@_date: 2016-04-15 12:25:25
stay calm and code on!
@_date: 2016-04-22 07:09:31
moon!, wait this is not ether? lol
@_date: 2016-04-23 03:27:58
sell your all gbtc and buy real bitcoins :)
@_date: 2016-04-11 04:59:12
banks/paypal/remittance do eat your conversion rate too
@_date: 2016-04-25 11:00:39
he'll do it for double that price
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:50:35
bro, where can i buy this magical coin?
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:09:56
guys, the cavalry is here.
@_date: 2016-08-14 09:18:06
i don't think the 'ink' can stay on for many years
@_date: 2016-04-29 07:18:46
yah, not a direct use of bank account
@_date: 2016-04-11 08:38:13
2 hands to clap bro. when it goes live will u be supporting it or just sitting around?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:26:32
i'll buy some at 0
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:13:44
u've got a more expensive bitcoin from them. if it's fine then all right.
@_date: 2015-12-04 04:48:24
fungibility is on the protocol level, u can't expect companies to follow that. we could move to an anonymous coin if that's the top priority
@_date: 2015-12-04 10:34:21
those spams are working :)
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:19:14
and what would the reason be in this case?
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:30:15
okcasino, best thrill ever
@_date: 2015-12-20 09:18:36
locking up bitcoins to earn money seems like a great business
@_date: 2015-12-06 00:46:25
if u looked at the private market that linq is first to replace, it's spreadsheets
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:59:26
eli5? i think that's an old list? mark once moved 424k bitcoins as proof of ownership
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:16:39
is google or apple better today or if they split into much smaller entities 
@_date: 2015-12-16 18:16:55
nah, they have a small ® there.
@_date: 2015-12-18 06:17:26
recommend me a bank that pays 5%?
@_date: 2015-12-04 04:56:56
indeed, i never needed coinbase to use bitcoin. that makes coinbase good, o wait
@_date: 2015-12-18 07:39:00
eh, looks like relatively low volume and price change but u still recommend trading over the holidays?
@_date: 2015-12-22 10:59:50
no offense but tim and barry need to change their profile pics.
@_date: 2015-12-16 04:35:37
link to form would be great
@_date: 2015-12-12 18:29:36
ikr, u could always shutdown the internet
@_date: 2015-12-05 08:33:06
if u're bothered with spreads, u should use their exchange
@_date: 2015-12-21 07:13:37
i'm not in everyone it seems
@_date: 2015-12-07 12:39:07
@_date: 2015-06-18 10:42:47
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:03:15
it's on the site

@_date: 2015-12-21 20:48:43
how was it done previously?
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:25:51
i have stopped using their service. do they provide anything that others don't?
@_date: 2015-12-20 07:35:56
a misconception that never fades, 1 share only represented 1/10 bitcoin at the start, it is decreasing due to fees.
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:51:12
more tx than spam attack? damn son
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:55:58
you would have spent much less if u've used a normal credit card
@_date: 2015-12-03 07:15:36
news flash, it's not free
@_date: 2015-06-05 04:15:33
the origin of each bitcoin can be traced to it's creation so you can't just create a few million and spend it. the network will trace your bitcoins and see that it is invalid
@_date: 2015-12-21 17:10:09
misleading title, the ubs guy is quite negative on bitcoin and bullish on blockchains and current model of fiat, bank.
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:22:32
you're looking for a Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet
@_date: 2015-12-05 18:05:17
what does chains longer than 100 means?
@_date: 2015-12-21 07:07:50

this is a news that we have more news soon. thank you for your time.
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:00:25
u can find all the info at their site
what other info r u looking for?
@_date: 2015-12-01 09:23:11
you might want to read the below for more info

he's blocked by marc? that's funny
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:53:30
not that clear about what mirror does, isn't it just a fiat/bitcoin exchange but using smart contracts? or is it a platform to trade smart contracts?
@_date: 2015-12-14 10:47:04
i think u're using it already.
@_date: 2015-12-02 05:17:13
u can pretend to know just like in kyc/aml
@_date: 2015-12-04 08:23:18

increase interest rates should reduce inflation
@_date: 2015-06-17 08:08:31
if i'm not wrong they use a risk adjusted approach (vs bitpay's average market price) by looking at demand of each side, quoting higher would mean there's lots more people changing usd into btc in coinbase than changing btc into usd
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:12:51
this has been happening all along in coinbase
@_date: 2015-06-07 12:58:38
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:47:39
tradeblock link as listed by OP
@_date: 2015-06-04 10:18:10
the 20mb and 1mb nodes do not discriminate transactions but discriminate blocks. so the same tx is actually received by all nodes
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:20:24
learn from coinbase ceo
@_date: 2015-12-05 05:53:53
u need to be more than a node to have free transactions, u need to be a miner in that case u could be forgoing revenue from other fee transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-21 07:06:40
u would have wasted 50k lol
@_date: 2015-12-02 19:26:45

@_date: 2015-12-04 05:15:09
just maybe fighting visa is not bitcoin's niche
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:57:04
as stated by OP, they are aiming 32 tx per sec, that is 19k tx per 10 minutes, and 1 full block is like 1.5k tx, it's obvious they are not spamming
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:22:51
too late to claim
@_date: 2015-12-04 08:26:34
u tried to turn this into a business instead of just using to buy coffee. lawyer up and good luck.
@_date: 2015-06-10 03:47:01
yes, if u have the private key to 50 btc before the fork, u would be able to spend 50btc on each fork
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:22:32
they are using euros, not greek money, so y would they buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:11:26
pretty sure he don't fully understand bitcoin or is just a contrarian for attention
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:11:49
looks like there are alot of lies/errors in public reporting, so to clear it up where did the coins go?

@_date: 2015-12-23 06:57:02
apple just need a license, then they can become a bank and payment processor to reduce the fees they pay to banks and credit card companies now. this is only possible since they have huge assets to back deposits. no blockchain needed
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:09:59
indeed, that's y 99% of people hold usd instead of bitcoin. so now u want 99% of bitcoiners not hold keys too...
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:50:46
since u will be there and the amount is not huge, using physical cash is definitely more convenient and cheaper

then y bitcoin at all?
@_date: 2015-06-07 12:15:59
this matters only in the case where the block number is the same. i.e. the same block got mined by 2 different miners within a short duration.
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:50:19
not sure if the goal of the test is to increase block size, but looks like transactions filtering and higher fees will be the way to go to effectively stop these cheap tests

    myLoop();
one of the sweeping address is 18ehHYsvkr4uzeMigfe48ThqPmoW8nCv7P and it's balance is swept to the vault address below with the op_return message 'hello mvg'
in the blockchain this is actually stored in hex, for e.g. if you search for this op_return in another api
it shows "script":"OP_RETURN 68656c6c6f206d7667", you can use a decoder ( to see that 68656c6c6f206d7667 decodes to 'hello mvg'
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:02:23
yah looks like the chain api simplifies this, anyway, to find the unspent outputs you would need to do an api call. for e.g.
    var bitcore = require('bitcore');
    var explorers = require('bitcore-explorers');
    var insight = new explorers.Insight();
    var address = '1KY4KrZWU5BYddeTuGTyWCJV34quoyPZUY';
    insight.getUnspentUtxos(address, function (error, utxos) {
        if (error) {
            console.log('Error in getUnspentUtxos: ' + error);
        } else {
            console.log('utxos' + ' :' + JSON.stringify(utxos, undefined, 2));
        }
    });
the result is similar to the utxo u posted

micro payments open up lots of opportunities currently not possible. as digital distribution cost have came down significantly e.g. song downloads, it is the time we should be asking if we decrease the price by 100 (1 cent per song) can we increase the orders by 1000? this is possible now as there is almost no incremental cost from more orders

like i've said, the overhead cost you are referring to (rental/purchase of property) is a much smaller % of costs for big banks than for blockbuster. i see the trend of smaller and fewer branches but banks also do customized financing/mortgages/investing for retailers who actually prefer facetime and also there are significant amount of people who do not use online banking

@_date: 2015-06-04 05:57:39
not sure which banks you are referring to, but a lot of banks do offer online banking services and if there is a need, they can close their low traffic branches and continuing serving customers online. on another note, banks earn a lot of "easy" money which cannot be achieved by new companies. e.g. borrowing at cheap rates and lending out

1. u don't own any private keys in bitstamp, bitgo and bitstamp each have a key and another key is stored as backup
2. i don't think okcoin.com servers are in china, in addition they have registered a singapore company for operating okcoin.com which is distinct from okcoin.cn
3. if you go to the page to deposit fiat, you should be able to see okcoin's bank

colored coins are based on unspent outputs, an address can have many unspent outputs, colored or not. coins get accidentally uncolored (assets lost) when you use a colored output and spend it in normal bitcoin transaction (without creating a colored unspent output). in your question, you would most probably uncolor your coins depending on which client you are using to send.

that is only the risks of a market maker/authorized participant, the real coins that back each share is stored with a custodian and moved only due to redemption of shares. meaning other exchanges being hacked has no relation to the safety of the coins backing the shares

that would be an invalid block and not accepted by other nodes

bitcoin is like a superset of digital cash, it can do everything digital cash can and more, thus to evaluate the potential of bitcoin you have to judge bitcoin on other merits.

abra does nothing other than connecting people, the tellers will have to do all the work in "transferring" the money and take on the risks. think of it like going to a shop to exchange fiat when overseas but in this case u can open an app and look at all the rates and go to the teller that suits u. 
1. user a deposit USD to american teller A for withdrawal in EUR in germany by user b 
2. user b open the app to choose any teller b that suits to receive the cash
3. teller a sends teller b bitcoins according to abra's rates then teller b releases the cash

@_date: 2015-05-14 15:57:09
I'm not sure if your use case is really a merchant/customer relationship or more of a b2b transaction as a merchant should not be bothered if he is paid by multisig transaction. the merchant only need to present an address for the customer to pay to. an address that the merchant can spend in which in your case would mean the merchant need 2 additional keys to spend the bitcoins he has received. b,c,d should create a 2 of 3 multisig address. the merchant will have an address (can be multisig or not but not multisig with the customers). b deposit funds to their multisig address, in order to pay a, persons b &amp; c sign the transaction to move bitcoins out of the multisig address to merchant's address. then merchant can spend his bitcoins without b,c,d
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:23:46
it's scary when u hear more news of their crowdsale than their product
@_date: 2015-05-14 07:27:09
say there is 50$ in a 3 of 4 multisig address. so wallets 1,2,3,4 will show 50$ but if any wallet spends the 20$ with approval from 2 other wallets, all wallets will show 30$. the balance is kind of stored in the bitcoin cloud instead of the wallet itself and can be spent anytime anywhere by anyone who is able to present the required private keys

at first the 20mb coin will continue to accept newly minted 1mb blocks (so in a sense if u're mining for 1mb u are also mining for 20mb but not vice versa). 
however once a 20mb block is minted, 2 chains exists as the 1mb nodes will not accept the 20mb new block and will also not accept any longer chains that have any 20mb blocks in them. starting here 20mb and 1mb will each mine their own chain only
if the 1mb blocks happen to form a longer chain, the 20mb chain will be discarded and move to the 1mb chain and this fight will continue again until the 20mb chain is sufficiently ahead that it would very hard for the 1mb to form a longer chain, most people seeing this will move to the 20mb chain.

1. break the consensus as there is no way to know if all the node's blockchain contents are identical from the hash 
2. ECDSA is a crypto algo not hash. 
3. bring down the network by mining blocks with no transactions or change previous blocks' contents and create a longer chain
but of course the beauty of bitcoin is that it constantly improves too
@_date: 2015-05-13 11:19:39

it's just relative. USD is stronger against other currencies, so for your point to be valid, bitcoin is inversely correlated to USD or correlated to some other non USD currency. Not sure how you came up with this assumption as historically this is not true.

instead of authentication done through third parties, it can be done on the blockchain
e.g. sending one time password to phone number (centralized, meaning each company using this method would need to setup their own infrastructure/outsource this to another company), you would need to trust that the reading/sending/generating of one time password is secure and also in the case of outsourced company that they will charge u a reasonable price
e.g. decentralized way, mining chip inside phone sends a transaction to an address with required data to authenticate user, in this case the infrastructure is already setup by bitcoin and 21inc. you will only need to monitor your addresses for transactions.
@_date: 2015-05-12 10:01:46

u have to go way back to his first blog post on the idea of increasing the blocksize
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:23:47
no committee is needed. miners can choose their own way of prioritizing tx
@_date: 2016-01-11 05:47:34
the truth is a more modern sql is what they need. but bitcoin is what we need
@_date: 2016-01-03 18:14:50
these kind of trades are actually fairly common in the traditional stock/futures/fx markets. don't expect it to go away, it always cost something
@_date: 2016-03-15 08:07:18
because he no longer owns bitcoins? lol
@_date: 2016-01-14 10:40:28
to be very technical, u can look at bitcoin's source code.
@_date: 2016-01-19 02:54:12
wait, it's not working?
@_date: 2015-05-27 00:29:15
fork the code and run your own chain? that has been happening for a few years now
@_date: 2016-01-16 07:59:10
well, someone still have to keep the cash so to ensure the coins on the fiat blockchain are backed. u can't possibly trust citicoin if they are keeping the cash. that's the major flaw of the system

@_date: 2017-02-12 12:08:04
not good, created a lot of uncertainty and reducing new ppl in china getting into bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-22 06:51:09
their own, they bought hyperledger
@_date: 2016-01-13 10:06:08
looks like they are poorer for not having bank accounts/credit cards and using alt financial products rather than by choice

corporations thrive more on buzzwords than facts. bitcoin has become a dirty word for them, blockchain is the buzzword for everything else
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:24:51
if u need more evidence that is trying to kill bitcoin and is rejoicing over this, head over to the same post at their site 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:50:38
it is a combination of properties 
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:19:38
we should regulate these exchanges so that there is no price manipulation like the traditional stock markets. oh wait 
@_date: 2016-01-20 12:35:58
bitcoin is dead, no way they can get charged
@_date: 2015-05-12 04:20:21
you are correct with trustless blockchains, but most companies are not looking to build trustless blockchains, so it is possible to secure their blockchains with trusted parties and no block rewards
@_date: 2015-05-11 05:59:27
so we are obligated to use his exchange? what's your point
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:43:54
he better be and activate segwit
@_date: 2016-03-26 17:07:32
unfortunately some services built on top of bitcoin are not done very well. use another wallet, i have never had such an issue before
@_date: 2016-01-02 20:23:20
no surprise here i guess. less of such articles would be better.
@_date: 2016-01-09 14:25:04
except when your website collects money
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:56:25
those ppl heading BU have already divested into alts and making a killing now
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:37:18
they can just quote u a lousy rate
@_date: 2016-01-11 12:47:07
itbit logo? lol
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:19:25
because blockchain, hehe
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:53:26
lol troll 
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:48:51
u can see the components, apparently localbtc price is skyrocketing 
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:54:55
markets are gamed all the time, crypto is no different. look at the timing of alt pumps, right after etf result and shortly after BU went into overdrive mode creating FUD to hardfork and now these 'quiting' and 'bitcoin dead' posts
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:02:12
bro, the fees for that feature is outrageous, just use the orderbook
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:00:46
he deserved his 30btc back but extra 5btc? wow!
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:39:12
time to change the mining algo? we need to put these miners in check
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:37:51
lol, he thinks he is smarter than the market?
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:55:49
randomness is less average than u think
@_date: 2016-01-11 05:44:23
i think u've been disillusioned. you have better odds at the lottery than this.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:33:40
cheaper? u'll be surprised how much ppl have made shorting bitcoin and pumping alts
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:04:54
depends on vitalik
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:18:23
i'm pretty sure u have 400$ in the bank too, what do u do with it?
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:47:06
bitcoin irony, more profits for merchants
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:03:22
he had sold way more into eth/dash/monero in secret, hehe
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:52:59
if your point is true, more miners will increase the value of bitcoin and miners will mine bitcoin before users come in. which is not true at all. miners started mining because there is a profit potential or profit margin, they does not have to believe in bitcoin at all. look at alt coins, miners change whatever they mine based purely on profits, no ideology, they doesn't care about the coin they mine. when more users came in e.g. ethereum, and market cap rises, all miners went to mine it. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:29:58
agree, miners should never have control to dictate what users want, but it had worked ok enough in the past. this time we are facing errant miners trying to attack the network, take back our powers!
@_date: 2017-03-08 09:27:22
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:59:05
when miners try to 51% attack the network, we fork them off
@_date: 2016-01-19 04:40:42
i think gavin quit on his own? if a majority agreed with u they would have moved to xt, no?
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:33:04
nice logo
@_date: 2016-01-27 06:32:28
why is there just a pile of rocks on their note
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:57:21
nice catch
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:56:09
think they found 50 used addresses, only 2 have funds at that time
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:04:43
if u want lower fees, get segwit, it is already done
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:05:13
there is little doubt BU is shorting bitcoin and had been pumping alts
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:31:47
totally agree but who can convince BU?
@_date: 2016-03-21 17:58:04
u guys took quite some time
@_date: 2016-01-22 06:59:39
when it becomes less profitable and asic makers are forced to sell majority to the public
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:59:24
is he going to quit too? lol
@_date: 2015-01-16 08:31:21
feds sold the coins at a high price, so they can actually pay you back your coins if it turns out that those coins belong to exchange's clients
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:49:24
but what if the most vocal ones at are no longer bitcoin holders?
@_date: 2016-01-04 09:32:32
capitalism in china? that's new. i don't see how the US and EU are doing any different
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:17:28

@_date: 2016-01-12 11:29:30
conferences have always been a great business, if u can get a crowd. a corporate crowd would be best
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:03:20
basically what they are saying is if BU wins, bitcoin dies, if segwit wins, bitcoin dies, if BU and core compromise, bitcoin dies. lol. if this is not anti bitcoin i dunno what is
@_date: 2016-01-03 18:02:17
looks like it's sending 852btc to lots of small accounts? what do u mean clear tiny accounts to zero?
@_date: 2016-01-14 07:33:28
no, as long as you have the transactions records to back up your business, everything should be fine unless your country bans bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:02:44
there is nothing special about pow. pow coins can be created easily but no miners will mine them because there is no profit. if tmr a pow coin comes out and pays more rewards than bitcoin to miners, all will flock to that in a heartbeat. does that mean bitcoin should be valued less? not really if that coin is doing something totally different
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:51:17
segwit and lightning are different things bro
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:35:35
indeed, the story over there is that core is attacking BU, core is evil.

what do you mean by everyone?
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:59:12
indeed, we will see more BU ppl 'quiting' and announcing bitcoin dead
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:15:57
lol, kraken ceo is roger's good buddy
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:29:37
u need to read the comments of the post, not just the post alone
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:30:24
it is very different now
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:33:24
he can just sell some dash for btc, hehe
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:21:22
at this point it isnt even clear if that was intentional from BU to use it to kill bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:10:39
my direction of travel is 200, coding 0, go with me instead?

@_date: 2017-03-18 15:25:31
do i put my drink in the hole?
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:17:45
how about not allowing anyone to sell lower than last price?
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:55:02
u're right on liquidity, that's y it is so much easier to pump/dump any coin compared to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:44:30
they are stalling segwit though with their attacks
@_date: 2016-01-16 07:51:19
by power? only hashrate matters
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:00:54
lol exactly. most political debates are based on self interest/investment, not sense. a lot of money have been trading crypto
@_date: 2015-05-06 09:59:58
VC investments are 90% failures
@_date: 2016-03-26 18:55:43
unfortunately it's one of the most popular wallet. i wouldn't say one of the most trustworthy since they have a history of issues
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:34:16
okcoin.com, well u went to all the wrong companies it seems
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:00:30
technocrat? don't think he knows tech enough
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:41:25
alot of talk while BU doesn't even have a reliable client, so wait again?
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:15:35
there are no new yorkers online in the bitcoin world :)
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:04:36
can be posted in github, hard to ddos that
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:22:12
unfortunately those heading the BU gang probably have sold tons of bitcoin and is ready to kill bitcoin to the end
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:33:19
cryptsy's theft address is known, there's no tx yet
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:31:53

back to good old days of news saying we will have news soon. thanks for your time.
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:59:30
it's ok if 100% american :)
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:33:43
BU signalling doesn't mean they are running BU nodes though 
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:56:37
btc haters and eth are the same group of ppl. crypto isn't that big. take note that eth always took opportunistic times to pump, like after mike hearn saying bitcoin is dead and after bitcoin etf news
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:02:59
BU is near their end because they know if segwit goes through, they will have no more ammo to attack bitcoin. that's y they are so anti it
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:01:57
wsj/nyt: not publishing this
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:34:16
how many bitcoin guys are at davos?
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:22:46
just look at that post, most are just promoting ethereum lol. and are just the same ppl
@_date: 2016-03-29 10:42:09
copay doesn't hold your bitcoins and doesn't know your private keys. u don't even need to create an account to use copay so u're not trusting a third party in this case. if u meant u need to trust their code, then u can review their code. it's open source.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:04:52
wait, u run a few? there u go guys, the proof u need
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:46:02
read the comments, they are rejoicing at bitcoin's mess
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:21:04
isn't that the same with many stocks?
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:48:43
yes, but we need to actively push for segwit too, else bitcoin will be killed by BU gang
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:32:48
wish i have a business that i can just past down costs and keep my high bonus 
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:05:49
hope jihan can see how he is killing his own biz and activate segwit
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:51:23
miners need to know their place and just carry out what users want, not what they want. miners can try to fork us out but we can do the same too. and no one benefits
it would be stupid to think that a security guard that secures the bank vault owns the vault. take back our powers and activate segwit!
@_date: 2016-03-05 04:16:15
there are lots of rules to follow to develop a car or spacecraft, nba has a huge barrier of skill entry. problem is if u're not happy with miners u can fix it much easily. i didn't say i wasn't happy with them.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:57:28
dude just doubled his nodes, lol
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:27:24
realshit, realshitty
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:28:10
fail to short btc, easier money pumping alts
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:56:42
nothing new indeed, i'm just amazed at their dedication on destroying btc, looks like their big payday was worth it
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:04:27
to try get more ppl out of bitcoin and crash bitcoin price so he can say he sold at the high and made the right decision
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:36:53
drop? where?
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:00:07
there's already a coin for that, hehe
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:45:43
as long as enough people back your fork
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:59:50
depends who is doing the hacking :)
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:18:40
time to look at the money trail as usual, oops R3.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:54:57
it gives power back to the central bank as they will be able to track the money flow, currently they need to ask the banks for that data. that should end the corruption that the central bank doesn't like
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:09:08
he sold mark's cat for compensation
@_date: 2017-03-08 09:25:42
think those insiders sold before news release
@_date: 2016-01-09 14:27:55
nice choice of name there
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:23:46
first off, did u spend the time to understand the technical details or just went with a simple high level narrow view
@_date: 2016-01-11 12:45:31
best advice from tim should be never to own bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:20:05
u should update yourself on this, gavin left on his own and is no long a core dev
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:42:26
u missed out the part he made bank.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:04:46
because alts can make him much richer
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:59:27
how fast it confirm?
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:32:20
almost missed the xmr shirt!
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:38:11
and all this blocksize stuffs was started by...
@_date: 2017-03-30 14:59:09
C++ 
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:58:03
damn that ripple mention
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:47:07
up to u to judge his agenda of posting such a strong article at such a timing too
@_date: 2016-01-08 07:35:37
damn those speculators
@_date: 2016-01-22 06:56:48
core support is not dead!
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:34:36
lol another day at hard to believe any of them still own bitcoins
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:53:58
OP point was it was controlled by a few ppl, which your point seems to agree
@_date: 2016-01-20 11:07:13
ok u got me confused, so who's the enemy now?
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:45:24
it is not stupidity, it was their goal
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:40:47
their plan is to kill bitcoin with it
@_date: 2016-01-21 06:44:46
CS got their attention just as their marketing team predicted. gd job!
@_date: 2016-01-20 12:28:43
digital, meaning not blockchain based?
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:02:30
their plan is to make money off the markets though 
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:04:05
they are just trying to stall segwit and hope bitcoin is killed
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:01:49
BU will find other things to attack bitcoin, best to fork them off. miners are just security guards employed by the network, we get new ones when they turn errant
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:33:30
miners are just security guards we hired, we hire anyone who can do the job and fire anyone who doesn't

fact is BU is blocking segwit which is ready. Many ppl have already stood up and said BU is too risky a client, so if BU have no clients, based on what should they be stopping segwit?
@_date: 2016-01-08 03:08:25

we need segwit fast, these guys aint helping
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:48:14
y not activate segwit first since BU client is not ready? unless segwit solves the blocksize argument, if not BU can fight for it another day when they at least have a client ppl can trust. or is BU totally against off chain scaling and will fight their way to disable any off chain solution? that would be very short sighted
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:56:55

@_date: 2017-08-04 12:04:48
bch difficulty will drop though and they are not worried about miner centralization and 51% attack. what a weird coin
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:39:45
confidential tx are on the roadmap, would have been released if not for the stalled progress by anti segwit ppl
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:48:16
considered negative news, less margin, less trading, less interest
the reason fiat is so much more successful than say gold is because u can lend the shit out of it!
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:24:40
is there any govt investigations or just bank's internal investigations?

@_date: 2017-01-17 07:02:58

this is just a bad comparison that exaggerate the hashing power of bitcoin. this implies you would require 8x the effort to build 500 supercomputers to build the bitcoin hashing network, which is not true at all, you would only require the effort of building a few supercomputers to build the bitcoin hashing network

@_date: 2015-08-03 15:09:32
what would be your use case for knowing the tx sent time? only tx confirmed in a block is valid so the sent time should not be very useful also the sent time returned from different apis could be different which complicates things if u're depending on it

the supercomputer analogy is a misconception, it is far more expensive to build supercomputers than miners. the reason supercomputers can't mine as fast as miners is the same reason miners can't compute as fast as supercomputers, they are built for different uses. e.g. antminer s5 retails for about $350 for 1,000ghz, total network hashrate is 400million ghz or $140million worth of hardware, the cost of 1 or 2 supercomputers.

1. u can take a look at how other coins are doing it when external data is needed e.g. bitshares, augur, basically they pay and depend on a smaller number of people who are trusted, they are also punished for giving 'wrong' feeds e.g. voted out 
2. like u said, they are pretty trustworthy, bitcoin is even more trust able than them, there are many political problems with having different govts working together and many self interests to deal with
3. as long as hashing is trusted, the checksum is good enough to verify the authenticity of the document but u would need to time stamp the checksum too so that no one can change the doc and checksum. for accounting (not verifying docs), the blockchain can track all ownerships, something that is lacking in today's system e.g. you go to a warehouse of goods how are you to determine who owns them other than depending on some paperwork the company provides to u

it is actually more puzzling y miners are blocking segwit in ltc. there is no blocksize issue. since when miners became so critical of protocol upgrades? the softfork signal was always a means to ensure all miners upgrade and not lose out on income, not an approval from them to upgrade or not

if u choose the option to store the keys yourself, you can spend the coins without coinbase. but if u lose the keys, coinbase can't recover for you.
not sure what you mean by their recovery tool won't load, it's open source so you can always port it to a different language that works

you are much better off with just a wire transfer if it's one off and a significant amount. you will most probably get an even worse exchange rate if u use the aud-&gt;btc-&gt;usd route.

@_date: 2015-04-04 05:45:22
that is because overstock and other companies at the moment does not have much use for bitcoin. if they could use bitcoin to pay some of their bills, there would be no need to exchange bitcoin for dollars. so we need higher adoption not just for retailers but also for businesses.

not that he has explained everything but he's the official statement
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:34:04
time is still tracked in the blocks but they don't determine the block order and yes they are used in the retarget formula
there is an allowance for time difference,

most bitcoin exchanges do not require you to be in the pic
@_date: 2015-09-03 20:28:41

we are talking about money here, not economy. it is widely agreed that money should be a good store of value, in this case the dollar would not be good money.

put the word bitcoin and u get to advertise in reddit, next level
@_date: 2015-09-14 20:11:54
well, they can freeze your account anytime they want without reason
@_date: 2015-04-20 15:17:38
it is a burden at the moment because it is hard for the business to spend bitcoins
@_date: 2015-09-15 07:18:57
that would be fine if clients knew
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:52:40
doesn't xapo or anx debit cards solve your problem?
@_date: 2015-04-12 06:05:49
not sure about that, but sure they are good with fancy websites and pdfs
@_date: 2015-04-16 03:17:05
looks like they burned through 1m, wonder what they spent on
@_date: 2015-09-06 04:04:50
where do u learn these stuffs then? can you post it here?
@_date: 2015-04-16 07:34:30
their dev team probably wanted a fixed usd salary rather than a fixed btc salary, is it ironic?
@_date: 2015-04-28 07:49:03
based on this pattern bitcoin will go to 0, u can just all in short now for maximum profit 
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:49:13
they have used lots of disposable usernames
@_date: 2015-09-04 04:48:24
if you are not doing anything suspicious, go ahead, else it would be better to use another service
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:04:42
there is an allowance for time difference, but the hash will determine the block order

@_date: 2015-04-28 20:26:43
at least they accept bitcoins this time
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:20:36
who takes care of the exchange rate? anyway great work on bitcoin, it's an irony that on a trustless network people question everything, no one questions discounts on the legacy system
@_date: 2015-04-27 11:03:09
did 1 a few days ago, left it overnight and it was done
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:07:35
go check out their website, transactions through bitpay is free but there is a subscription fee for support
@_date: 2015-09-06 04:08:42
then y is a bank run possible if the bank has all the money?
@_date: 2015-04-10 08:17:46
they will probably avoid bitcoin as they have no control over bitcoin. most of them are not targeting a global model like bitcoin but a limited decentralised model with just a small number of trusted "miners" (their business partners)
@_date: 2015-09-17 04:01:57
it would be suspicious to wire to someone's else account not under the person's name
@_date: 2015-09-12 19:43:26
is it blockchain.info? stop using that site, will be good if u provided tx hash

bitfinex and okcoin removed?
@_date: 2015-04-20 06:37:31
for comparison, hotels do that too
@_date: 2015-09-03 10:56:08
prioritization of this kind could be done based on tx behavior pattern alone, not origin/destination/identities e.g. circular transactions with lots of inputs/outputs of the same address that appeared in the previous block
@_date: 2015-09-01 06:54:26
blockchain not bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-23 07:53:32
evidence for legal proceedings are generally not released to the public while in investigation, having said that if you have a great idea to recover those coins, you can contact wizsec. not sure who is working on the investigation though, wizsec doesn't seem to have the source code of the site. Anyway it will be naive not to believe that some coins were lost somehow else mtgox would not have gone bankrupt.

there is some confusion here, it is widely accepted that by definition, Bitcoin means the blockchain technology while bitcoin (no capital) means the coin itself

easy to copy no doubt, getting the users to use is the hard part
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:55:25
well they are still a decentralized network to this day by the description used
@_date: 2015-04-26 06:27:21
not sure what you're onto but sounds like another exchange
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:46:20
we need a hockey stick though
@_date: 2015-04-29 05:16:16
that is not possible atm, if it is bitcoin is practically useless
@_date: 2015-09-02 20:49:52
currently this is not enforced by the network anyway and is very hard to enforce on a protocol level. miners can mine whatever they want
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:37:00
bip101 or XT is a hard fork, that is different from an alternative implementation, moreover it shares most of the core code with the reference client.
an alternative implementation is better to be one built from the ground up from the protocol references in another language 
@_date: 2015-09-02 21:40:55
they are not censored, they are prioritized lower. anyone can mine it, not quite possible to censor transactions
@_date: 2015-09-24 11:55:24
they have some expensive directors
@_date: 2015-09-14 20:10:54
try less than $0.01 with credit cards
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:42:22
dont think there is any issues with telling others about bitcoin, just don't tell them to buy bitcoin if they didn't ask first
@_date: 2015-04-27 06:34:40
how many bitcoins are we talking about?
@_date: 2015-09-17 04:24:36
wait it out for a while. the atm operator is not very ethical by relaying u a tx based on tx that is not confirmed yet.
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:50:38
bitcoin is an asset/currency/payment system all in one, first of its kind. there are no parallels in the traditional system so u can't really classify it
@_date: 2015-04-09 10:06:26
i'm referring specific to the picture as OP has stated this is game changer
@_date: 2015-09-15 09:49:21
people will build their own altcoins or blockchains that suit their own purposes and use but the function of bitcoin (alternative currency/asset and decentralised asset ownership and transfer) is really hard to overthrow at this point of time. people seem to have a mindset of e.g. if citicoin is created or blythe masters not using bitcoin then bitcoin is dead but seldom the scenario that both can exist and are valuable because they serve different needs
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:57:58
check if there's a public message on blockchain.info else you can just keep it since no one is claiming it
@_date: 2015-09-15 09:05:45
i don't find using credit cards online is easy to use, there are many steps involved to get setup and familiarize with. sometimes a need trumps user friendliness
@_date: 2015-09-02 21:37:05
they are mined, just prioritized lower.
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:38:02
because they need their 2x coins, gold coins and many more hehe
@_date: 2015-04-25 08:21:49
it's not about claiming it's a stock part, it's just part of their portfolio/transaction/trading system so that they don't need to setup any extra stuff to have an exposure to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-04 04:57:01
how many bitcoins are stored there?
@_date: 2015-04-21 03:36:09
if you are referring to your intra Canadian bank transfer then yes, but most exchanges accept wire transfer from any banks provided account is under your name
@_date: 2015-04-21 03:32:20
the hotels are mandated to keep a copy of customers' details in most countries, so they will take a copy of your passport with whatever equipment they might be using
@_date: 2015-04-17 21:48:08
scaling it/reducing latency are the difficulties 
@_date: 2015-09-14 20:08:47
it matters because of hype
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:23:54
not sure if u do believe in bitcoin, if u have so much faith in banks, there really is no need for bitcoin

1. is it a 1-1 relationship for private and public key?
2. e.g. using 256 bits, how many valid key pairs are there?

all of them, hehe

your argument is failing and you are just introducing technicalities here. so dollar is good money for only a year? then it is not good money. dollar can be considered good money on other functions but store of value is not one of them

@_date: 2015-04-07 08:37:49
a comparison would be great
@_date: 2015-04-05 00:02:44
you can find it all over the internet, give a source that agreeds with you
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:19:11
you normally would need to show your passport during checkin, so on the contrary hotels can use your passport to setup a bitcoin exchange account
@_date: 2015-04-06 15:27:55
customers aren't owed any response? maybe that's the reason their volume is declining big time
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:32:54
how does internal pooling within bfx work?
cooperative pooling would require exchanges to setup contracts with each other, these contacts are barely enforceable so it is pretty useless and no one would like to take the risk. these will also be opaque and potentially disadvantage the traders
for better liquidity, there should be a way to easily and quickly transfer cash/coins to and fro each exchange for traders
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:32:37
Bcash. LOL
@_date: 2015-09-16 18:05:04
since they are open sourcing it, it benefits everyone, if it's better than bitcoin so be it
@_date: 2015-04-04 14:36:50
every bitcoin started from being mined i.e. in a coinbase (not the company) transaction in which there are no inputs. each block only has 1 coinbase transaction so every single satoshi has to be tracable back to its coinbase transaction to be valid
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:23:30
hmm, how many decimals can it go on LN?

has bitcoin core fully downloaded the entire blockchain?

it really depends if your windows computer is infected, to play safe, just create another cold wallet
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:29:20
just below extended public keys there is "last wallet addresses". there is one address even for a new wallet
@_date: 2015-11-27 12:40:06

maybe they don't want to?
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:41:20
bitinstant was registered as a msb, it did not complied to msb rules, this in itself is a chargable offense

did it miss any blocks?
@_date: 2015-11-27 09:16:16
well, not surprised that it will be a public company then. have u created any private companies already? i haven't created any decentralized biz yet.
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:21:38
so private blockchain?
@_date: 2015-11-14 07:08:17

but that sounds very andreas
@_date: 2015-11-12 07:45:35
u can go to preferences, advanced, wallet information to see all the addresses, the balance should show all bitcoins from all the addresses
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:09:29
lol 2 are very different. if core had not used signalling early on we would have segwit already, now is too late of course. for dao fork, yes u set the chain but there is no signalling. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 03:17:57
link to a saved graph on blockseer?
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:53:37
better to send to your address
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:01:43
the protocol does not enforce that a block must have tx, since it is not trivial to determine if there are really any tx in the network
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:36:32
nope, this thing has to land back where it started
@_date: 2015-11-27 09:33:35

it's amazing how govts controlling money is a fairly new concept while now people are so ingrained in it that they are unable to imagine a world without it.
@_date: 2015-03-13 09:15:58
think of central bank as having the power to invalidate any transaction and track all transactions, so this can't be done without blockchain
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:11:16
spam could be 1 of the reasons
@_date: 2015-11-23 05:09:13

are there any regulations on how much money you can wire overseas?
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:26:59
not sure if i got this right,
1. so i can't really spend the usd I have in bitreserve, I have to find someone who accepts bitcoin and incurring the usd to btc conversion fee when I "spend" my usd.
2. is it possible to tranfer usd in my bitreserve to another bitreseve account? are there any fees involved for same currency transfer?
@_date: 2015-03-14 13:51:19
they are probably selling mining shares and got into trouble when people lost money
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:27:09
or u could use a credit card
@_date: 2015-10-26 22:19:06
looks like that dropped to 0.09604763.
tradeblock should be having the latest number, they are using 0.0959
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:25:58
@_date: 2015-11-27 09:24:36

you should read up on this case more. charlie had never proposed that he is innocent or he does not know what is going on and you are here thinking he has no idea he is breaking the law. perhaps the sentence is debatable

pay more fees please (&gt; than block reward) and they will get mined
@_date: 2015-11-12 08:07:04
that would be a very long list, ask coinbase and bitpay
@_date: 2015-11-10 03:38:20
well, the link between the cia meeting and satoshi disappearance is actually made by gavin himself, not the community. he simply disappeared, so there is no explicit handover of project
@_date: 2015-11-19 13:57:17
well, they have to appear that they are doing some work
@_date: 2015-11-18 13:31:03

they provide the means of analysis to the respective enforcement agencies, it will be up to them how they want to act on the info
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:55:12
sure, but they aren't doing that. they are using debit cards at the moment. they are probably going to make this into something like apple pay and stripe/braintree/paypal to buy things with since they did everything inhouse. facebook want their market share

there are some discrepencies here, depending on the regulator, they classify bitcoin as a currency/property/commodity/others to their advantage. (CFTC actually sees bitcoin as a commodity as they want to regulate it) vague guidelines are pretty common to protect the regulator itself

not sure how much this is better compared to other p2p remitance such as ( that has very little need for underlying transferring money across borders. i.e. A transferring 500EUR from usa to germany is matched with B transferring 455$ from germany to usa without having the money going across borders

@_date: 2015-11-28 06:20:38
i think that's an idealistic view of trading without currency. current currency system can certainly be improved on but is much more efficient than without currency (there are much more trades going on that compensates the mispricing of each trade). in your model there could be better pricing but much less number of trades going on as it is quite a hassle to match each trade instead of just matching half of the trade with currency.

the longer chain wins, so miners will always want to work on the longest chain. even if nodes do no accept it, ultimately the difference in lenght of the block with less skimpy blocks will be too big for nodes to not accept the chain with more skimpy blocks
@_date: 2015-03-03 06:49:02
yes it might be traded at a discount or premium but what I am saying is that 1 share is worth less than 0.1 btc and this is probably slowly going down. if you look at 2014 december numbers, bitcoin/shares = 0.09757 (2% lesser)

in the silkroad case in which ross the creator was convicted, ross was actually involved in the trade acting as a middleman for escrow, so it is not the same case like ebay where the developers just created a site and did not participate in the buying/selling

I was just offering an alternative but majority reason based on my experience. as for your point, most people's wage can not be easily substituted, meaning I could receive a low value check but cashing it out or not, i will still receive the same wage since it is fixed to a certain extend for most. likewise i could have spent the time needed to cash the cheque on other things, but that doesn't change my wage. it's not a strong argument to rationalize all factors based on monetary value only.

0.1 is just a guideline as the shares are not redeemable for the underlying bitcoins unlike an etf. due to management fees and cost in acquiring bitcoins you will probably be getting much less. i.e. the fair value should trade below btcusd/10

@_date: 2015-03-21 18:53:18
so they have absolute power to decide which coins to keep? this opens a precedence to a lot of ambiguity that would destroy bitcoin

@_date: 2015-03-16 11:05:47
as mentioned
1. the holder of aes password and vault to private keys are not the same. so there is always at least 2 person involved in a outbound cold wallet transaction. i don't see this as a single point of failure.
2. there is a segregation of the computer doing the decryption and the one signing transactions so this is not totally unnecessary. the paper private keys are retrieved from the bank, not scanned. maybe you could explain why scanning does not inspire confidence
3. are you suggesting a single cold wallet vs 10,000? are you suggesting not to use paper wallets or is there a way to use paper wallets without printing? if the aes password is compromised, all private keys should be changed, not sure what is the need to reset the password.
4. not sure how a trip to retrieve the a certain portion of private keys will expose all private keys as the aes password holder is another person
5. valid point

not as trivial as adding another currency in which they probably have a template for doing but they certainly could add it. but think of it, why google isn't as good as facebook/twitter in the social space, why facebook isn't as good as snapchat/whatsapp/instagram in the messaging space (had to buy some of them), why paypal is losing market share to braintree/stripe (had to buy some of them). creating the function is one thing, to be successful is another

nothing is truly secure. your bank could go bankrupt tomorrow but why do you still put cash in it? your country could be under attack tomorrow but why do you still live in it? the main reason is that these probabilities are low and you have other things to worry about, like getting money for food.
the probability of randomly generating 2 private keys that are the same are probably many magnitudes smaller than the cases I have presented above.
@_date: 2015-10-26 22:16:11
that's how finance rolls normally
@_date: 2015-02-04 06:09:32
big numbers are indeed hard to comprehend, there is a higher chance of entire human extinction than generating the same private key randomly, so you might want to worry about human existence instead

what products/services are they working on?

coinbase based on their strategy (to become popular through being regulated) chose to side with the US government. this does not suddenly make everything they do correct

lol i think this went to imgur frontpage and got downvoted by non bitcoiners

op question was why is it hashed down, why not use 256bit hashing
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:55:32
need time to find those private keys!
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:30:13
not likely to happen soon as this would legitimize bitcoin and make bitcoin a huge competitor to national currencies i.e. having &gt;1 widely used "currencies" in a single nation 
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:56:04
coinbase doesn't have a choice? they chose to go down the regulation path because they think that will make them successful, not because they had no choice. to them, going through each hoop is an edge they use as a differentiator to competitors
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:57:25
doesn't happen to bitcoin now but there could be a case where there are no pending transactions so a block with only a coinbase transaction is valid.
adding more transactions does not make it easier or harder to generate the required hash, or invalidates your previous attempts to generate the required hash as no matter the input the chance of generating the required hash is the same (uniform distribution)
the question really is why would everyone just include the coinbase and nothing else? i don't see any benefits of doing that
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:41:40

copy paste of original article on wizsec site?
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:37:33
in this case it was clear that it was flagged because the transaction was associated with coinbase

quite a number of ethereum hacks used changelly, this could cause them problems when they are funneling those funds through poloniex
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:56:12
there is an allowance for the error of the timestamp
more importantly the hash will determine the order

it is consumer protection, so it protects the buyer, you are correct that the seller is not protected. think of it this way, in general sellers are companies/businesses while buyers are just normal retailers, it makes sense that buyers need more protection than sellers. of course this case is an exception
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:44:08
it's not trivial to release a standard

not true, a govt must honor all physical cash unless they change their currency but a govt can deny any digital cash anytime (most probably due to suspicion of credit worthiness).
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:54:19
why has the decision been made such that more than 1 private key can spend the bitcoins at an address?
@_date: 2015-02-20 08:58:03
probably a spread like when you exchange physical currency for another country's currency
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:01:09
possible that btce had vested interest (lost some coins) due to evo running away

you're right, but miners are unlikely to start mining bigger blocks if there is a low number of updated clients. what is more likely to happen is miners update their clients, keep mining valid blocks and once there is enough updated clients, start mining bigger blocks. so yes, pretty much still to be decided by other clients, not miners alone
