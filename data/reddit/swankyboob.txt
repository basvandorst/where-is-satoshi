I did the same. I bought in at $215, watched it crash at $266, forgot about them for 6 months, then bought more at $400ish.  I sold most around $900 after the first wave of negative news coming out of China. 
Good luck on whatever you decide!

Man up. You're acting like a little bitch. You bought the bitcoin. You knew the price and the volatility that follows this cryptocurrency.

Don't worry friend, it's just money.
Remember what your priorities in life are.

as a person who bought bitcoin but still doesn't know what's going on, life is still good.

I wouldn't. China is waking up now. It will fall farther. 
But I have no idea if/when to buy back in. 
Don't take my advice though.

You've heard this a million times - no one knows how the market will react in the future. 
My "gut" told me to sell, so I sold a few 10 minutes ago via coinbase. I usually regret my decisions to sell ,especially when the price jumps $50/BTC, but you can't win them all.
I share the same thoughts as you though. This rally will be followed by a dip. How big of a dip? That depends how large the sell orders are.

Not angry. You need to take responsibility for your actions. You can't have sex without a condom and not expect a baby once in a while.

Hang in there champ. 
You will get what you want, but you have to communicate it to them, not us.

Read the last line of my comment.
I put it there for a reason.
