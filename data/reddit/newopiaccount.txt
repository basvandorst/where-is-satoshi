Ya I was high as shit and realize how dumb I sounded. I was arguing against myself lol
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:36:11
You’re dumb as shit obviously. I swear this dumb attitude only surrounds bitcoin on Reddit though

I saw the interview and know what you’re talking about. My point wasn’t about 50 cent, it was more about what claiming bankruptcy means. I could care less about 50, I don’t know the guy.

I needed to read this as an junkie, ex-“drug” dealer (weed) that is currently clean, to finally understand why money earned from a real job is such a better feeling than money earned selling weed (knowing I’m stable and can survive with one while with the other always “on the run”, not knowing what’s around the corner).
BTC has no correlation with my drug use though, never got into the dark web. I built computers and wrote code as hobbies before I found junk and lost all meaning of who I am/was.
Sorry I don’t know why I decided to just share that, something just clicked as I read your post....

By the way, the whole coin is the gift card. Pretty cool play on BTC I feel.

Lmao you think just because he was “bankrupt” he was broke? He went from having to pay hundreds of millions to like 20 million, which he paid off and is now living rich again.
@_date: 2018-09-21 04:14:17
...but how do you know he didn’t just admit to not holding it because that was an easy and convenient way for him to hide that specific asset? That’s why the bankruptcy is important.
Yes, rappers are given things to take pictures with (cars, money, jewelry) and are paid to say things like that, but that doesn’t mean 100% of rappers do it or that everything they say is instantly just some marketing ploy.
If I was him and had invested into bitcoin, I would tell everyone as well as I would assume that would help raise the price so I could then sell.
The smart ones have entire money teams full of people constantly using the money they have to produce more income. The not so smart ones are spending those giant checks as soon as they get them on things they only dreamed of being able to do before (shit, prob not even dreams that big) and can’t say no to when old friends / family call asking for help. It’s sad but true.
All I’m really saying though is: just because he said he didn’t invest $8mil into bitcoin AFTER being hit with those lawsuits and then going into bankruptcy does not mean he never really made that investment.

Both teams seem to censor each other. I kind of understand why though, the fighting gets annoying.
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:55:01
If you give them your money, you are allowing them to use it how the wish.
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:18:16
Ya.... cause the people with billions will agree to be on equal ground with even the people with 100s of millions. You only see it this way if you gain something, no one that loses would agree.
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:57:24
This isn’t for people like you obviously. You should be happy this is happening

Us drug users do not now what "unspent cash" means ��
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:53:38
Worst anology and/or comparison ever
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:46:45
Top 3 paragraphs in the pic are why it’s important and a good thing for bitcoin future, it’s not just a “computer wallet”
(Wouldn’t let me highlight anything on the site)
@_date: 2018-07-22 07:55:14
Why wouldn’t you just post it when 100 people are asking for a PM?
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:58:02
Don’t thank him, he waited the 3 hours on purpose!
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:01:25
It does, usually to poor white people. The problem is the financial equality line is even more skewed for anyone of color; eventually it should even out, but that’s not today.
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:33:29
People pay cash for it everyday. You got a good business. Enjoy

I feel like I’m really missing something important by not being around for this lightning phase lol I remember the first example of a lightning BTC app a year ago (I could be way off) but never saw anything happen with it.
Why should we be running our own full nodes to verify transactions? Is the regular network not safe these days?
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:31:49
Square already sells bitcoin, but they don’t accept it yet. It won’t be long.
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:37:07
You’re all good. Some ask for a drivers license / ID though. And they all have cameras.
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:05:37
I still don’t like it looking at me. Needs tape 
@_date: 2018-07-25 15:16:43
And eventually a broke idiot, and I’m all for bitcoin. But dude is saying he’s willing to bet his life (assumption from how confident he is) on 60-40 odds. Ya it’s much better odds if you’re addicted to gambling, but otherwise everyone knows 60% doesn’t = 100%.
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:54:32
Ya everything I’ve seen has revolved around the lightning network. Is it being used already?
@_date: 2018-07-23 16:15:29
Ya and they’ve been selling it for like 6 months so it’s not brand new.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:48:58
To remind us
Edit: people been probably saving these up for 6 months, enjoy 
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:35:01
Square already sells bitcoins and all visa and MasterCards are fine with it.
@_date: 2018-07-28 15:59:16
My only question is: how do you get your coins if you don’t have a bank? I wish we could all be paid in coins, but that doesn’t seem possible yet.
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:38:49
Coolest one I’ve ever seen: what do normal ATMs there look like?! Lol
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:35:25
Ya I have BTC core and the block chain file, I was just wondering if there’s a specific reason why this is becoming so big right now.
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:48:36
Ya I do, we aren’t exactly there yet. I’m not living in the future just yet. Thanks though
@_date: 2018-07-28 17:56:54
God damn, must be nice.
@_date: 2018-07-22 07:59:15
Dude you can’t even type properly. Your friends parents might have a panel or two.
