As far as I've heard though, Coinbase hasn't irretrievably lost any money. They've just been slow to return it.

Ah, it looks like this guy used a throwaway, but yeah I think you're right in general.

How would you find his name and date of birth? Maybe he's edited the post by now but I don't see any information like that.

I believe they could even deduct the losses? Smart move!

Those are some strange rules. I guess the government really likes the number $3000.

I don’t know anything about the guy, but it is suspicious that someone would randomly gift him that much money.

You're already buying a very high risk investment. Does dollar cost averaging really reduce the risk that much? I'm not even sure if it is less risky, given that BTC has been going up consistently.

Unusual things are expected to happen eventually, just by chance. I'm not seeing the connection between those two events. Still buying.

How'd you buy the burrito?

You should break up your story into paragraphs.

Thanks for the kind words! Perhaps the biggest problem I'm facing right now is finding an API for ordering egift cards for Papa John's and Pizza Hut. I'm currently using TangoCard, but they only have Domino's. I just talked to CashStar and they have Papa John's, but they only deal with high volume clients. I'm chasing some other leads, but if anybody here knows something let me know.
Thanks for the offer to help, I may add a donation option at checkout eventually, but I can handle costs for now (Heroku isn't too bad at low scale). Right now the best way to contribute is to buy pizza for another redditor. :)

Thanks! I actually just had a $3.50 beer half an hour ago, so now I guess that beer was free. :)

I'm guessing you're talking about ketamine.

Breaking the law for personal profit can be a good thing or a bad thing for society, it just depends.
