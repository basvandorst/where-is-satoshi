On t'a raconté n'importe quoi. Tu n'es fiché pour rien du tout. Tu as le droit de porter des BTC et leur possession ne constitue en rien une fraude fiscale. Tu n'as pas à les déclarer à l'administration quand tu voyages car ils ne sont pas reconnus comme une monnaie en France. 
La prochaine fois qu'un truc comme ça t'arrive, refuse de répondre (dis "je n'ai rien à déclarer") et prends le numéro de matricule de chaque agent. Tu vas voir, ça va les calmer. Ensuite s'ils te fouillent, ils ont le droit, puis ils sont obligés de te relâcher immédiatement. Quand c'est fini, tu écris au procureur pour te plaindre.

Even I thought you were exaggerating, I listened to your opinion. 
But when you said Spain nearly defaulted and is "dangerously close to defaulting", you lost me. It's just too widely inaccurate.
Oh, and by the way, Greece was a partial default, nothing like you imply.
So basically, you were wrong about France, Spain and Greece. Goodbye :)

France's rate ares at their lowest historical levels.
Spain will most certainly not default or leave the Eurozone, and I am pretty sure Greece won't default.
I think your scenario is highly catastrophic, even if I agree that fiat currency is a cancer that will torpedo the world economy is not addressed, but certainly not right now.
@_date: 2012-06-12 18:14:49


I will, because it's pretty easy to.
Spain's bailout was destined to her banks. It is a **loan** made to the Spanish government's Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB). 
Spain chose this because the rate was much lower than from the market. 
So no, Spain was not bankrupt, nowhere near that, and will not be. This bailout was a toxic assets buy-back and has nothing to with any default. In fact, Spain's debt, per capita, is pretty low. Even if Spain's debt has gotten worse, it is back to its 1990 level.
Now please go bother someone else, **you** have no idea what you're talking about.

The internal European market is so huge that fluctuations will not be a major problem. 
Also, the UE has enormous reserves of gold and other precious commodities it can back its currency with, so I think that doesn't impact the EU as much as, say, Japan.

I agree, but the introduction of a currency is a critical stage: if you ruin it by constantly flooding the market with more supply than demand, there will be not future for BTC.
@_date: 2011-09-12 12:11:36
Thank you man, thank you for this.
@_date: 2011-08-31 16:51:04
Sure. But when a great bartering NGO was founded, allowing thousands of people to exchanges services without spending money, it was shut down by the State and the owners were fined.
Not that I am against currency, which is one of the greatest inventions of all time. But still. Most of those people did it because they didn't have any money. Scumbag ~~mafia~~ State.
@_date: 2011-10-13 07:38:59
BTC used to be around $1. It went up to $30 for like two weeks, now it's going back down to 1. Or less !
Bubble 101.

@_date: 2011-09-05 05:01:45


No. 
But dasstrooper is right, the bank will win eventually. All exchanges operating on French soil will have to obtain licences to act as financial institutions/brokers and will have to record all transactions and keep a file of all users. 
Otherwise, it's jail time, baby.
@_date: 2011-09-09 13:13:27

@_date: 2011-10-13 07:15:43

@_date: 2011-09-06 01:01:17
Under French law, that makes them de facto brokers, even a financial institution. 
The French don't kid around with that: gotta have a licence, which means all your clients have to be identified by name. And of course, they have to log every transaction.
If you fail to comply, you get shut down, then fined or jailed. There goes France.
@_date: 2011-08-15 10:50:38

French lawyer here. Just read the court decision. 
This was a slam dunk for the bank. They lost because they have a shit lawyer. They will not drop this, it will be handled by the group lawyers somewhere down the road and the defendant -- and all other exchanges operating on French soil -- will be severely ass-raped in court.
It will set a nasty precedent. Prepare for a wave of related suits all over the EU.
@_date: 2011-10-17 20:52:02
You were downvoted because you are a dick, only because of that.
Everything in you screams inferiority complex. The fact that you actually came back to this thread months after it was opened tells a lot about your mental state.

Legally, it clearly is theft if financial institution sends you money by error, if they have the paperwork to back their claim and the recipient refuses to return the funds.
So if the guy is not incorporated and there is no paper trail, he doesn't have a case. And even if he does, he is in the EU...
Sad, really. 
But if I were him, I try to get the guy's address and make the trip, though. It's worth it and the thief would surely piss himself.
@_date: 2011-09-07 19:35:59


It might be theoretically true, but I still think that supply will dwindle as the rate falls.
It's also true that there is not enough demand. As long as people use BTC for shady purposes, there will be a market though. I have no idea who much that will amount to.

I was quite surprised actually. Was betting that it would stabilize around 5 for quite a while.

@_date: 2011-11-14 23:17:03
The trend is still the same: more supply than demand. 
I thought BTC would stabilize around 7, so I can't say I passed forecasting 101. Albeit small, the BTC market has proved surprisingly resistant to forecasting anyway.
@_date: 2011-09-07 09:24:29

We are one of the leading countries in the world for network speed and connectivity. If you don't have DSL, you're in the 0.01% of areas that have satellite Internet, with huge state aids paid with my taxes.
