Thought I was going crazy.  Same issue here

Yes, then add the general public’s understanding of the tech and there’s an even bigger gap.  A lot of people have never thought about money in the abstract.  The target is moving too fast and a lot of people aren’t even sure what they’re looking at.

Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.


Anyone's guess.  Try and find some other bitcoin 'crashes'.  The price has always surged, then fallen to something higher than before.  It's easy to get excited about these all time highs, but look at the percentage increases in the last year.   A 1000% increase on investment is insanity.  Ethereum is sitting at 5000% and Litecoin at 2500%.
If I were college me right now, I would invest something very small like $10 - $20 in the three main cryptos on coinbase.  Pay attention to the % change by day, week, year because that's all that really matters in terms of investment.  If you just want to see how it works as a currency, you can also do that

god damnit.  this is what i get for trying to appear smart.  I meant 10 fold.

Fuck yeah! Been following cryptos since btc was 180ish.  I checked my wallet today for various transactions I’ve made in the past, and it was around 25.  Fucking mind blowing using a currency this volatile with deflation at this scale.  I still think it is a totally viable option for a currency, but btc leads the way and is a very different beast than the others.  I think it isn’t going away any time soon.
Side note to any new crypto enthusiasts: investment is only meaningful on a percentage level.  ETH and LTC are both surging at higher percentages than btc.    If the high barrier of entry to btc is intimidating, look into others and how they’re different.  There are hundreds. 
What a huge milestone!!!!  Please don’t eat your testicle guy who said he would at 10k.

But you get the same ratio of gains when litecoin goes up $10 and btc goes up 1000. Not bad
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:25:38
exactly.  you get higher fractions when the price dips.  ie more bitcoin for your $

Not a bad plan.  Enjoy the ride.  It's hard to not pay attention to prices when you have a little bit at stake.

Bitcoin was hovering around $1,000 only a year ago.  It hasn't just doubled in value, it was squared.  There is no investment opportunity I'm aware of that can yield returns by orders of magnitude.  20K seems insane, but so did 10k a few months ago

What a glorious hour of 11k glory :)  I've been on this ride before.  Still expecting it to top 15k by 2018
