I'm not in Caracas, neither in Venezuela. I live in Madrid, Spain since 2007, but I left a few banks accounts there. So I can trade VEF - BTC, receiving VEF by national bank transfer or deposit.
Localbitcoins provides an escrow service. When you put an order on my ad ( they block my btc (from my localbitcoin's web wallet) for 90 minutes. You have that time to put VEF in my bank account or to put a transfer order; then you mark that you have paid and they extend the block for a few days. When I check that I receive the money (VEF), I release the BTC and they put it in your localbitcoin's web wallet. Then you can transfer that bitcoins to any another bitcoin wallet do you have.
If you want to try, you can put an small order.

Depends, there is not a mandatory rate, dolartoday provides a reference based in VEF - COP  - USD exchanges at the colombian border. Sometime you can trade VEF USD for a lower or higher rate.
(COP = Colombian Peso)
However, if the buyer have special needs, like receive USD in cash (which sometimes is hard to get), or in a specific bank account in US, Panamá, Ecuador, or EUR in a Europe Bank Account,  can have additional commissions.
