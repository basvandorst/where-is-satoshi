John Dee is a magician in Los Angeles. He is going insane.
    My Name Is Dee is a novel for the educated reader who enjoys noir action, intrigue and dark romance, for the child in all of us who wants to go on adventures, and for the fearful adult too who marvels at the terrifying scale of this universe. Battling aliens, journeying between dimensions, exploring the immensity of the human mind, and saving a woman are on the docket for John Dee in this noir adventure.
   And he must choose what moral course his life is going to take: can he stand to still wear the grey hat?

For me it feeds too heavily into the current ownership of capital. Those who own the machines now will benefit most from mass inter-operability. 
Of course, the success of Bitcoin is also predicated on a political revolution to accompany the financial one.

My friend's reply I thought was useful:  
"This is how we respond to State persecution... we multiply.
Nodes are individuals. Each individual is a node onto him/herself. Large exchanges can also be nodes but as we've seen when some exchanges were shut down, new ones sprung up. It is sort of like how the war on drugs whereas you can take down Pablo Escobar but another will rise to take his place. It is never ending.
The one large weakness is the electrical power grid which is centralized. If a terrorist attack, a nuclear strike (causing an EMP), or a large solar flare (causing an EMP) were to occur (among other possibilities) were to hit the power grid then you wouldn't have that which is required in order to power block-chain technology.
A solution to that is renewable energy. Not in the form of a central power grid but rather decentralized where every individual is a power node producing power and sharing it on an interconnected grid."

Most economists don't spend enough time assessing the meaning of household management, which is what economy is, at root in etymology and at root in meaning. Bitcoin will succeed economically if its house stands and thrives, and what makes a house stand and thrive is only secondarily, or tertiarily, concerned with money.

The Taliban is the best modern example of a government-less society;  also known as the Pashtun Way. This relies on custom--and religion--to enforce order.
Bitcoin has already adopted some aspects of this with our "new customs" -- hopefully we will continue to innovate in this area. Software is not enough for us to succeed.

The rich became rich--generally speaking--in only one way:  through violence. ANYTHING that is a serious threat to billionaires quickly acquires targets on its head(s). 
Bitcoin needs more than good crypto to seriously challenge the class system (which includes banks). It will need a decentralized army and feedback system to respond once they start bombing nodes and/ or disappearing prominent programmers.
