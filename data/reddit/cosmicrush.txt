It's going up now tho btw
And I was joking mostly. Just because you are you being the hater. 
I don't have any bitcoin. I have LTC and ETH. Not much either. 
I don't get depressed. My focus is in neuroscience and I'm trying to write quality blog posts so I can use it for my portfolio basically :) 
Remember I'm joking so calm down. You sound like you lost money and are mad. I lost nothing so far :)))))) lol. I'm still at 200% profit at least.

You are just a boring normie man. You are the copy paste. Your entire life is just a meme. Duplication. Fitting in. Good for you I guess. Or shall I say good for all of you copies?
Which one is the real you D:

Don't worry. I think it will be good. It's starting to go up already but that's probably not going to boom until days later I imagine. 
I think part of it is actually people like you panic selling lol. It's inevitable. They don't want to be negative.

What do you mean depressed when price went down? Are you ok? I think you are delusional as fuck. I never said anything about being upset. I did attack you for attacking someone though because I have empathy. 
I'm a music producer, blogger, neuroscience major who plans to work on AI and make it sentient. I have a gf that is a fashion designer.

The difference of computer vs you is insignificant realistically. It's not like the 30 seconds gives you time to react to it lol

The whales are drug lords since the Silk Road is gone. They just decided to market the currency instead of their product. It is working.

Yes and maybe I'm here to alter your environment so that you say other things now lol

Can't really say that something is this simple. What if personal responsibility itself is a grandiose delusion?

Are they also resisting the crash too? Controlling the changes at all? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:02:21
Maybe it is literally because too many people selling? Or maybe that's the excuse.

Maybe showing your intelligence makes you more suspicious :0

Money-launder yourself in your sleep even. They need cameras because you sleep talk. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:54:44
Or they know what they are doing and have bad intentions. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:05:41
That happened to me a few days ago before the crash.  I'm new tho so I never purchased before. It said it was confirmed too but kept showing 0 balance.
