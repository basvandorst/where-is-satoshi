You might have some luck finding someone local who sells bitcoin. Meet in a public place have them transfer the bitcoin and give them cash. unfortunately for a lot of people this is the most secure way, as paypal users can file an unauthorized claim and get their money back and keep peoples bitcoin.

I'm pretty sure that's incorrect. Because the size of the transaction would have to be directly proportional to the amount being transferred.

Depends on how much you sent. Larger transactions call for  a larger transaction fee. If i sent 100 dollars worth of bitcoin at that i wouldn't expect it to clear for a couple days.

This isn't variance. The price of bitcoin has significantly dropped in the last 2 weeks. Yet the difficulty continues to raise in-proportionately to the value of bitcoin. Soon it will become unprofitable for anyone purchasing even an antminer s9 to be mining, and i'm not just referring to the outrageous purchase cost. I'm talking solely just the cost of electricity.

I have. here's a exerpt by David Shwartz that explains it
"It is important to understand that the transaction fee you have to pay to make a payment is based on how you received the funds you are using to make the payment. The outgoing payment (assuming it's only to one place) is always going to be the same size. So the 'out' part will always have two standard "pay to address" scripts. The size of the 'in' part will depend on how many outputs you have to claim, which depends on how you got the funds.
So I wouldn't suggest charging the transaction fee to the person withdrawing, because then you're billing the user based on parameters the user has no control over. The transaction fees depend on things like how many transaction outputs you have to gather to get the coins needed. That's completely dependent on how your funds are structured.
Imagine if you walk into a candy store and are told that a candy bar is 35 cents, but then when they rang you up, they tacked on a 15 cent fee. When you asked them what it was for, they explained that the previous customer had paid them all in pennies, and in order to give you your change, they'd have to count all those pennies, and that takes more time."
yes it is possible for a large transfer to take less space, likely? no.

They've added to it. Not in just regard to their total % of hashing. but if you looked at the blocks found over the past week there is a significant uptick in antminers blocks found on the block chain. So if you've been consistently checking block explorer over the past few weeks you would've seen this.

Sounds like the bitcoin nodes are just overloaded at the moment. There's a lot going on people moving coins in and out of exchanges. So even though you might have a higher tx fee its on a low transfer. All higher paying tx fees are going to take priority over it. Do you have the hash for the transfer? you can check on the block explorer what priority it is set to.

I'm aware of this but i think something i said kind of got lost in translation. I was just saying those who opt to pay higher transfer fees will be favored. So yeah people sending more bitcoin are more likely going to have larger file sizes as well as adding a high transfer fee so even though his ratio .12 cents to his .50 cents he's sending is significant. it's not significant in regards to someone sending 5,000 dollars worth and adding a transfer fee of say 20 dollars.
