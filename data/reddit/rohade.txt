I'm from Venezuela, first you have to understand that there is a currency exchange control, for more than a decade we havent been able to change bolivares for any other currency so shopping on internet, travel, etc is impossible unless you get dollars on black market, thats why that value dictates every price on Venezuela.
Our average income is less than 3 dollars a month, that's why most services and some food and medicines -if you can find them- are subsidized or coudnt be affordable.
The problem is that the government is broke due to massive corruption, and now they cant subsidize and since electricity and such are not profitable they cant do maintenance, etc so the services are very cheap but crap and with no hope of improvement.
Another consequence is that finding milk, cheese, chicken is almost impossible, a lottery actually. I purchase chicken at a black market price with a restaurant that sells black market chicken.
People are not investing on bitcoin here, they are farming if they can, my cousin and I farm on a 1050 ti, yes, for both of us but we make more than my cousin monthly income, in my case I'm an engineer and i make less than 40 dollars a month so its also a lot of help.
Our situation is tricky to understand but if you want to know about us, our lifestyle or more details of our economy and how we reached this situation I've been keeping a diary for almost a year.
You are welcome to do any question and I may do an AMA soon. Have done a couple in que past as well and also a couple posts to make warnings about Petro, which is not what it seems.

are altcoins crashing because segwit?

I think its wrong, many more enterprises are sucessful when they have a leader, in bitcoin case there's still leadership distributed into its own system.

If you want to die due to lack of medicines or live months without chiken or basic food items in total chaos and crime, come here.

As a venezuelan I can explain you why
Since the economy crashed and people's income is so low, goverment has to subsidize, or try to subsidize some basic food items and some medicines and services. So electricity so far is subsidized or people wont be able to pay for it.
Thats why we have a very hard time finding items like chicken, eggs, and even the basic food without doing lines of many hours daily. Goverment is broke due to corruption and they don't have enough money to subsidize so demand is so low that the few items available dont meet the demand.
Keep in mind an engineer full time makes about 50 dollars a month

There's almot no cash here because the inflation so small businesses suffer a lot withou a PoS.  An icecream is almost always purchased with credit cars here. Most cc limits are less than 15 dollars.

I'm Venezuelan, 40 years on this country, that's so wrong
Before Chavez, our oil was around 9 and we lived normal and better of course
If anyone wants to really know how we reached this which is mainly due to massive corruption using a currency exchange control and failed expropiation, read my entry on my diary.
That explains why we are having inflation rates of 10000 in a year

You could also use venezuelan bills.
I see many posts about it, I'm here and have been for 40 years, if you want to know why we reached inflation rates of 10000 in a year, read my post of my diary, I'm open to any question as well.
