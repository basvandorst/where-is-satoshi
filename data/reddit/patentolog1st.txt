What drove the price up so much in the first place was China weakening its currency, the CNY, and Chinese people diving into BTC to try to preserve their wealth.
Now China is strengthening its currency, and Chinese people are moving out of BTC and back into CNY.
The swing may be exacerbated because so many Bitcoin miners are located in China -- a big currency swing means DUMP NOWNOWNOW or BUY NOWNOWNOW to try to beat the crowd.
Note: CNY is sometimes also called RMB, based on the abbreviation of the romanization of the name of the currency.  The official symbol on currency exchanges is CNY however.

Many-to-many.  Some addresses belong to investment trusts.  Some individuals possess multiple addresses.  Some addresses belong to a single person.  Some individuals possess only a single address.  Then there are the multi-sig addresses where multiple people may control a single address only through the joint exercise of their control. . . .

Does he really still expect USDBTC to break 3000 in 2017?  What does he see driving the price??
More importantly, though, what will drive bitcoin *adoption*?  From the unlimited potential of a few years ago, I see bitcoin bogging down in a few relatively small use cases today, such as remittances.  Locally, the bitcoin meetups seem to have died out, and I'm not seeing any companies trying to drive it as anything more than "put some money away, this will be huge some day".

Lots of Chinese people bought bitcoin mining rigs and now control the mining operations.  The government of China manipulates its currency quite openly.  The combination means that when the government of China acts to change the exchange rates, the miners react by dumping or buying BTC as appropriate to the move and to the anticipated future environment.
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:19:56
Initially we would see a selloff as people try to cover their losses on other trades by having to sell BTC.  It would likely stabilize at a lower level for a while.  If people begin to adopt it for more and more transactions, to avoid the problems of government-controlled financial systems, then eventually it could soar.

"Practically impossible" doesn't exist when the function returns a number within a finite range.  SHA256 returns a 256-bit number, which means it has a maximum of 2^^256 possible values.  There are more than 2^^256 possible inputs to it, therefore there are guaranteed to be collisions.
Yes, the functions are designed to be one-way.  That has nothing to do with the fact that they are of finite size.
Is the criterion that it's supposed to be **impossible to figure out a second input that will produce the same output as a first input**?  Is Google's breakthrough that they were able to come up with a systematic method for doing so (with SHA1)?

My bad, you do have a point there.  OTOH the $20M in "paper gains" does not make her a multimillionairess capable of hiring legal representation to assist her with a complex international bankruptcy process.  It makes her someone who lucked out and then got scammed.
I mean, do you even remember the whole mess?  The Japanese police weren't even sure what to do.  Karpeles didn't get arrested for months.  The Japanese courts didn't even know if they had jurisdiction because what the hell is a "digital currency" and why are all these foreigners camping out in front of an office building screaming in their foreign gabble?!  It took something like a year before the bankruptcy court even told people they could try to make claims.
Unfortunately, a lot of people who got involved early on didn't realize just what a nightmare keeping funds on an exchange was going to turn out to be.  The lesson of MtGox still hasn't been absorbed by a lot of people who leave their BTC sitting on exchanges.  (Full disclosure: I have about 0.3 sitting on an exchange as my hot wallet.)

Yet more proof, as if anyone needed it, that the NYT is full of shit:






Regulations don't strangle existing businesses;  even when they weren't actively colluding with the government to design the regulations, they still merely have to incrementally change to any new regs.  Regulations prevent new competitors from arising because the compliance costs make it impossible to launch a new business in the sector -- there's simply too much to cope with, so new businesses never even get attempted.

ROFL.  No, the reason the markups are high is because the BTM owners think they can make that much off people.  Anyone buying at a BTM is either desperate or paranoid, and they get charged accordingly.
The only local BTM I knew of went from a ~10% fee down to ~4% the moment the local exchanges rolled out, and eventually the owner sold it because nobody wanted to pay even his 4% markup when they could pay 1% anywhere else.  Now, unfortunately, the local exchange has increased their take to 3%. :-(  Oh well.

The media has been a shitshow for decades.  Internet sources are becoming the only way to get around the blatant self-censorship that the media imposes on its lackeys.  One perfect example was Hillary collapsing at the 9/11 memorial ceremony.  She had numerous signs that her health was absolutely shit for at least the previous three years, but the news media refused to mention anything about it (while demanding that Trump get a medical evaluation because he's \*gasp* two years older than Hillary).  Then some random tourist gets a video of her collapsing into a heap as the SS valiantly struggles to prevent her from faceplanting and the tourist puts the video on YouTube.  Suddenly: "Oh, yeah, Hillary's been really really sick lately, *but it's really nothing, ignore the fresnel lenses, the anti-seizure glasses, the blood clot in her brain, her inability to walk up stairs unsupported, and all the rest*."


What, Dredd Scott didn't do that for you?  How about the Slaughterhouse Cases?  Internment of the Japanese during WW2?
Judges fuck things up like mad all the time.  Trump is absolutely right to call out Robart, a lowly district court judge who overstepped his bounds by blocking an executive action that falls outside of judicial review.
Oh, and incidentally, I bet you weren't foaming at the mouth when [Obama attacked the Supreme Court during a State of the Union address](


What, you mean all the illegal aliens going around and killing people?  Just had another in Indiana yesterday, some poor 60 year old guy got smashed into the afterlife by a drunk illegal driving without a license.
Not to mention the over 1000 illegals deported in the last few weeks, at least 75% of whom had been convicted of felonies -- and who Obama seemed unable to deport despite some of them having been convicted before Obama even took office.  Guess he was too busy encouraging them to vote in the election to bother sending ICE to deport them.  Yay team!

1) no, maybe
2) maybe, maybe
3) consult a tax attorney
The rules aren't that difficult. Whenever you have a transaction that generates a taxable event, you have to declare it and pay taxes on it.  A taxable event is one where you exchange one thing for another of value and realize a profit on that.  If you lost money, it is not directly taxable, but you may be able to offset a profit that you made on another event.  To see whether you can offset, look up the rules for the particular class of stuff, in this case personal property.  Consult a tax attorney as necessary to ensure you are in compliance.
Also, assuming that you were perceived to be in compliance at the time, the IRS can only go back seven years, unless you are the one who has reopened the wound further back.

Not really.  The guy behind the website is a Russian emigre who was banned from the securities industry for illegal stuff.  He basically runs a Soviet agitprop website.
He makes posts on both sides of an issue early on, then calls people's attention only to the old posts that turned out to be correct.  In regard to Bitcoin, he has posted things mocking it and mocking those who are dumb enough to use it, as well as lauding it and praising those who are smart enough to use it.  When the price soars, he links back to his predictions of rainbows and wonderfulness.  When the price falls he links back to his predictions of doom.
For other things, such as his constant stream of comments about Goldman Sachs fucking over its clients, there's quite a lot of truth to that, but even so, he only mentions their recommendations that fail, never their successful recommendations.

Oh, and "1 Bitcoin = US$575" when I paid for some electronics over the web a little over a week ago and had to get a bit more to cover any fluctuations that might hit before the guy I was buying from did a price fix.

Didn't coinbase have some serious problem recently about losing a bunch?  Maybe they're trying to suppress the price so it won't cost them as much to get back to zero.
Saw an article yesterday saying that MtGox's problems were really a result of having been hacked **before** Karpeles took over -- the exchange was already 80,000BTC short, and they figured they'd make it up over time.  But then the huge price rise hit and they would have had to make up over US$100,000,000 to cover their preexisting loss, not to mention the additional hacking that stole a few thousand more BTC from them.

Such as every site that reported on the content of the Wikileaks DNC emails -- Breitbart, Zerohedge, Veritas, and all the rest.
Meanwhile, CNN was caught letting the Hillary campaign approve their stories before release, and NBC was caught reversing the meaning of quotes by only partially quoting them.
Not to mention NBC's and CBS's long history of such things as setting grass fires behind trucks and pretending that the truck caught on fire because of a manufacturing/design defect, or disabling all the safeties inside an automotive transmission *and hooking it to an air compressor to cause it to fail catastrophically*.

China's currency just sank below 7:1 to the USD for the first time in years.  China is devaluing because their economy is a trainwreck internally -- lots of fraud, such as taking out loans from eight different banks against a pile of copper ore and then skipping town, and local governments simply making up economic numbers to hit the national government's targets, and state-owned enterprises that function primarily as ways to embezzle funds.
It used to be that the extremely wealthy in China could move their funds abroad through questionable "business deals" such as buying property or a company or commodities for more than they were worth -- this is why Vancouver real estate shot up so much, the Chinese were buying teardown shacks for a million dollars, then flipping the shacks to someone else so that they could get their money for use for some real purchases.  (There was also a legal blog which famously discussed how the law firm whose founding partner runs the blog was asked to file a fake lawsuit against a Chinese company, which the company would then "settle" for a ridiculous amount of cash, so that some executive could move money out to pay the "settlement" -- basically using the courts to launder money.)
However, China has been cracking down on money movement lately.  Bitcoin is a way around that, since it is basically impossible to block.  About all the government could do -- and so far it hasn't -- is to start executing anyone caught using Bitcoin to move money around.
For the merely moderately wealthy on down, Bitcoin is an easy way to preserve wealth from devaluation or even to move it abroad.

The gambling arguably wasn't a taxable event.  The IRS doesn't go after people who buy casino chips and then lose them.  It would be more clear-cut if the particular online casino you used does its gambling in BTC units rather than in USD or EUR or whatever.
The other two are taxable events IF your BTC had increased in value from the time that you bought it to the time that you exchanged it for something else.

It's a basic concept for fiat currencies.  
So when rates rise, the currency usually will strengthen relative to other currencies.  This is why Russia hiked rates well into double digits back when oil was collapsing at the same time they were getting sanctioned for shooting down MH17 -- to stem investor flight.
With the Federal Reserve hiking rates on the USD, it will strengthen relative to other currencies.  (Assuming of course that the Fed doesn't fuck up royally like they did in 2001-2008 and create a huge bubble that they then burst catastrophically again, or collapse the economy due to hiking too rapidly despite a really bad economy like in the late 1930s.)

You might try talking to the people who run Rebit.ph since they're running one for the Philippines.  From what they used to post here, they mostly seemed to do it from Hong Kong, which is a bitcoin-friendly territory (and has huge numbers of Filipina maids, and has rule-of-law for the most part).
I'm guessing your workers are mostly doing construction in the Middle East -- at least, that's where I see news about Nepalese workers.  I don't know how hard it will be to handle bitcoin in those countries.  My impression is that the labor companies don't follow any laws or contracts anyway, so getting paid in bitcoin, or buying bitcoin with company scrip, probably is going to be a problem -- the middlemen who rip off 20% fees aren't going to be happy about it.

Well said.  If Bitcoin cannot handle more transactions, all it means is that the transaction processors (miners) will be able to charge more and more for each transaction in order to get the transaction into the blockchain -- which will in turn kill Bitcoin, because who wants to pay $25 to transfer $14 to a seller for shipping a Raspberry Pi Zero?
If the goal is for huge international payments between corporations to be settled on the blockchain, then the current transaction volume might be ok.  For general, popular use among individuals -- especially "the unbanked", which all the leftie weirdos seem to have glommed onto as a raison d'etre for Bitcoin -- the transaction volume needs to be several orders of magnitude higher.

Googling doesn't show any rants about it being a scam.  That said, it may be that the software is flawed, or that you set it up wrong, or that they've recently been subverted, or a hundred other things.
It's always best to test with a small amount first, and to do your research ahead of time so that you know how to use everything.
Note also that the Bitcoin ATM probably had huge fees and a crappy exchange rate.  It wouldn't be at all surprising for one to charge you 13.5%.  One Bitcoin ATM locally used to charge over 10%;  the exchange that eventually took over the market started at a 1% rate and is now up to 3%.

In some cases it's a bad idea, in many cases it's a good idea.  You have absolutely no way to protect against others using your invention if you *don't* patent it.  On these miners, for example, we've already seen that people are disassembling the firmware to analyze it -- that's how someone found out about Jihan's miners having a killswitch.  Anyone can do the same and build similar firmware based on that as a template.  On the other hand, Elon Musk doesn't file for patents on SpaceX's innovations because no one else is capable of stealing them -- the rockets are either destroyed or he recovers them.

Technically, one cent.  Realistically, because the IRS asks people to round to the nearest dollar when doing reporting, fifty cents.
That is if you are talking about earned income, interest, or other taxable events.  If you mean "I'm hodling and it's gone up in value, halp!" the taxable event is when you spend/sell/exchange.  Bitcoin is classed as personal property by the IRS, if you merely hodl, there is no taxable event.
This may change in the future, especially if the price keeps rising.

The existing calculation is the primary prior art reference;  their novel feature is the optimazion of eliminating certain unnecessary sub-calculations.  Thanks (hah) to the Supreme Court, an examiner can argue that such routine optimizations are done all the time, pull up some random article out of a journal about doing that in general (say, for a graphics algorithm about polygon clipping), and claim obviousness because of KSR.  Another examiner will just allow it because what the hell.  A third might actually try to look for similar art within cryptography and allow it if none exists, or argue it if some does.  In the end, it's a question of luck -- whether or not you get a patent is mostly dependent on whether the examiner you get is a jerk, is lazy, or does his job properly.

No, it's not.
I just read the letter, and the letter makes it very clear that the patents haven't issued yet.  They may never issue;  some 40% of patent applications never do.  This is even more the case with so-called "software applications" in the U.S., since the Supreme Court has made such a mess of things over the last decade or so.
The only "provisional right" in the U.S. is 35 USC 154(d), which, IF THE PATENT ISSUES WITH ITS CLAIMS IN ESSENTIALLY THE IDENTICAL FORM AS THEY WERE FILED IN, lets the newly-minted patentee demand a "reasonable royalty", and only on the equipment that was manufactured or sold in the U.S. market.
Until and unless that patent issues, anyone can use all the information in the application to do whatever they want.  Demanding that manufacturers shut down production is not only not a legitimate demand, it's a move that could cost them dearly.

Unless the China patent application has been sold as well, and is going to be prosecuted, this is pretty useless news.

Back in law school, my patent law prof challenged us to find a single case in which 154(d) damages had been granted.  He does that every year, actually.  Last I asked, no one had found one yet.

Fine, I'll let you misinform everyone and get them in trouble.  Then I'll laugh.

Brand isn't relevant;  each BTM owner can set any given machine's rates and fees individually.
There used to be one in Taipei that charged 10%, but at least it honestly reported the rates.  That died pretty fast once an exchange made Bitcoin available at the vast majority of convenience stores on the island.  Now the exchange is giving a poor exchange rate. . . .

I really don't give a fuck about it.  All the anti-inequality assholes do is try to rob successful people in order to enrich themselves.  So you can fuck right off.

Not that there's anything wrong with that. . . .
