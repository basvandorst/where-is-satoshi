Those who control society are billionaires and right wing religious fundamentalists like JP, the Republican party, or the Islamic State.

The status quo is the run of the mill religious conservatism JP espouses constantly which the majority of the US population has been rejecting. The side of the political spectrum rejecting it are those on the left, not the right as they are in bed with all manner of religious extremist. JP himself parrots the same crap as Islamic Clerics, same with many religious nutjobs in the US who are Christians and Catholics. So much overlap between those gorups and JP's views it's like he belongs to those groups
He is staunchly anti-abortion and is perfectly OK with using government power to punish women who have them
The logical conclusion of anti-abortion nutters like him is to have every woman who miscarries have to sit in jail and go to court to prove to the state (who can falsify as much evidence as they want)  that they in no way contributed to an abortion even if they actually miscarried. It's religious barbarism in line with what places like Saudi Arabia and Iran do.
It's been that way in the US for over a hundred years, thanks to the political party JP supports called Republicans which he fails to criticize over anything important or meaningful. Why are JP fans so dishonest and manipulating as to lie about his views matching 1 to 1 with Islamic Clerics or other religious extremists?
Oh yeah because it's easy to pay people to make favorable comments about someone on social media. Like Donald Trump, one of Jp's favorite politicians
