What’s the best lightning wallet?
@_date: 2019-03-13 01:41:53
But but “mining destroys the environment”

Lol dude you don’t want the kind of pussy that only cares about your car
@_date: 2019-03-02 17:12:18
What??? This could not be further from the truth. Is Coinbase perfect? Of course not. They have done a LOT for raising awareness of Bitcoin and pushing Bitcoin (and crypto) forward.
@_date: 2019-03-25 03:13:58
Lol he’s not getting out, ever. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 00:19:18
Hahah this is hilarious
@_date: 2019-03-27 17:39:31
Thanks for answering my simple question 
@_date: 2019-03-21 21:14:12
Wow, this is actually big development news!
@_date: 2019-03-04 03:47:25
What a stupid, stupid comparison.
@_date: 2019-03-04 02:21:29
What really needs to happen is better UX. LN needs to be grandma proof 
@_date: 2019-03-24 15:49:02
Did you read the article? It has everything to do with it
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:33:48
What steps are being taking to make lightning network more user friendly?
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:19:29
Has to be gold color 
@_date: 2019-03-02 17:19:13
Wow, the amount of hate against Coinbase in this thread is fucking stupid and totally unwarranted. 
Is Coinbase perfect? No, of course not. Have they made mistakes? Yes. But they have done SO much for the advancement of the Bitcoin protocol, SO much for raising awareness of Bitcoin, and SO much for making Bitcoin/crypto easier to use. 
Coinbase has done way more good than bad. Anyone bashing them is literally completely ignoring all of the good they have done. Unbelievable. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 21:33:44
Run a node! Or learn to code and start developing!

Does Coinbase use native segwit yet?

I’m not sure you realize how much money is out there in the world...Bitcoin only needs to capture a *very* small amount of this money to be in the multiple hundreds of thousands per coin. Ex: $1 trillion market cap is roughly $50,000 per BTC. $1 trillion is just a fraction of golds market cap (I believe 1/6th of the market cap), and an even smaller fraction of world money supply. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 17:33:00
Dollar cost average 
@_date: 2019-02-18 23:08:20
It essentially reduces Bitcoin’s “inflation” in half. Less available supply results in upwards pressure on price.

You’d be smart to accumulate at these price levels. Bakkt will bring more money into the space.

If it’s a large amount of money, get a lawyer. Otherwise, make a HUGE stink online and hope that they notice. Be sure to include your support number!
@_date: 2019-04-15 23:47:56
Does Coinbase have segwit?
@_date: 2019-04-19 02:37:21
Of course
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:36:16
It’s crazy seeing screenshots like this. I mean seriously, who the hell could have EVER expected that we would have gone through what we went through and would still be here standing today at over $5k per coin? Just unbelievable. 
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:26:08
How is it a slippery slope? It’s just the market deciding what it wants. The market is composed of exchanges, individuals, whales, etc. if some of them don’t want to support BCH, then that’s their own choice. What happened with BSV is actually a brilliant example of a free market system. No one is forcing anyone else to do anything, everyone makes their own decisions.
@_date: 2019-04-15 23:53:31
So? Anyone can cherry pick. Move along
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:28:48
How long are they going to show fucking physical coins like this? Lol it’s literally the complete opposite

foxbusiness.com, people. This is what they write about 
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:39:11
I’m not saying it’s dead. It will be eventually though. BSV is being propped up, how is that not blatantly obvious to you? Low hash rate, dwindling interest, exchanges delisting, lack of volume (especially), etc.
But yeah, you go ahead and hold it. See how that goes for you.
@_date: 2019-04-23 21:17:15
There are WAY more shittier shitcoins than Litecoin

Lol people have been talking like this for YEARS, yet here we are...
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:31:04
BTC literally works just fine for me. No reason to switch to BCH. My transfers are always cheap and timely so idk what people are complaining about
@_date: 2019-04-04 02:32:24
Lightning is what needs the most work. We need better UX
@_date: 2019-04-22 04:13:52
Coinbase pro is much better. I think Gemini is pretty good too
@_date: 2019-04-27 19:02:45
Bitcoin is totally different from a stock and there’s really no relation so why are you going on about stocks having “real value”?? 
Bitcoin has real value too, despite not producing dividends, and like you said it has **completely** outperformed 99% of stocks since its inception...so yeah. When I hear someone go on about stocks having “real value” i just kinda laugh and tell them they should’ve bought BTC. I’ve gotten more gains from BTC in the past 5 years than the majority of people have gotten from stocks in their *lifetime* ����
@_date: 2019-04-25 02:25:38
If that’s what “people” are doing (however many that is) then it would be better to trade the opposite of this
@_date: 2019-04-27 22:45:51
12% fees too!
@_date: 2019-04-19 02:33:55
Lol if you think you’re going to be able to day trade bitcoin and make money, you’re in for a rude awakening. It’s extremely difficult to do and the vast majority of people lose money.
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:14:13
Lol dude what?? Who the hell buys a couch off Amazon? You’re supposed to go to the store to buy a couch, you know, so you can sit on it and see how it feels?
Vast majority of people will *never* spend more than $1,000 on a single Amazon purchase in their entire LIFE.

This has nothing to do with Bitcoin, wtf
@_date: 2019-04-28 01:42:20
Boom. I love this. All of these shitcoins talk like they’re the next greatest thing since sliced bread. Meanwhile Bitcoin, the TRUE HONEY BADGER, is still here over 10 years later.
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:23:37
Ok then you can go somewhere else and pay more. 
Btw if you think Amazon is the only company not paying taxes and spying on you, then you’re absolutely clueless because loads of companies that you use every day do the exact same thing
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:00:19
Lol no, not at all
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:13:23

Lightning is going to make so many altcoins obsolete
@_date: 2019-04-07 02:34:36
What’s your point? Please share. 
Tom Lee is a fool because he consistently makes price predictions over and over again, yet despite being flat out wrong almost every time, he continues to make ridiculous predictions. He is at best an idiot and at worst attempting to manipulate foolish buyers like yourself. 
@_date: 2019-04-12 00:43:37
Yea and it’s going to take over 100 years!
@_date: 2019-04-17 12:11:24
...but what’s the point if you can’t even withdraw it lol
@_date: 2019-04-28 01:28:00
Pretty much this. The other coins don’t come close to Bitcoin in literally every category here.
@_date: 2019-04-22 16:44:04
Of course. The question is when
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:01:37
Like another comment said, even IF you did buy back then, it would’ve been extremely unlikely for you to hold this entire time (I think)
@_date: 2019-04-15 23:41:39
Lmao this hilarious
@_date: 2019-04-04 04:21:00
Works perfectly fine for me lmao
@_date: 2019-04-23 21:14:46
No it’s not. I won’t be convinced until we break $10k. We could still easily go back to low $3k’s
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:22:09
Not really. When was the last time you spent over $1,000 in one purchase on Amazon? For most people it’s hardly ever.
@_date: 2019-04-21 23:08:29
Aww there there
@_date: 2019-04-07 18:33:01
Aww there there now, did someone’s feelings get hurt?
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:24:17
But but Bitcoin is “dead”
@_date: 2019-04-06 01:32:37
It’s all confirmation bias and seeing what you want to see. TA does *not* work because it is *impossible* to predict the market. 
Some TA people will counter this and say “oh but we’re not trying to predict the market, we’re just looking for trends”. Yea, okay. You’re looking for trends in the hopes that you can figure out a way to profit off the trend. 
So yeah, can’t change your mind because you’re correct here. TA is BS as far as I’m concerned.
@_date: 2019-04-15 23:50:20
Will you support Lightning Network?
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:01:37
We’re talking about a single purchase buddy, not the entire year. Duh?
@_date: 2019-04-29 01:41:11
I’d also like to know this. BlueWallet is confusing as hell because it doesn’t let you quickly move funds back and forth from lightning wallet to btc wallet
@_date: 2019-04-19 03:17:05
Lol Bitcoin does what it wants and doesn’t give af about NY
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:15:49

@_date: 2019-04-15 23:50:57
ELI5 what is bech32?
@_date: 2019-04-22 01:28:16
Because Coinbase chargers fees for buying and selling Bitcoin. They have very high fees compared to other exchanges
@_date: 2019-04-24 03:36:56
Great point here. Stock to flow is often overlooked but it’s so important when considering scarcity! A good short read I found about Bitcoin’s stock to flow:
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:40:57
Maybe he bought at the low $3ks, could’ve made a great profit so far
@_date: 2019-04-02 12:27:47
Lol this is comical. $4,700 a few months ago and people freaked. Now it’s a bull market? What are you people smoking?!

Lol right? Is that really necessary? She should be more professional
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:29:11
This couldn’t be more false. Coinbase has one of the best reputations in the space, *easily*. Are they perfect? No. Does their support still kinda suck? Yes. But they’ve done more for spreading/developing Bitcoin and crypto adoption/awareness more than any other company in the space. Seriously. Name one other company that has done *more* than these guys have.
