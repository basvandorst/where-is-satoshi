I don't think downloading is a "major" barrier. Unless you have bad experiences with downloading stuff from the internet that gave you unbearable trauma. If you're too afraid to download something, then there are sites such as paxful.

Just use actual trading platforms like Paxful instead of posting here.

That sounded so racist. basing your allegations on the country they operate. It's as if nothing good will ever come from Nigeria. Also, suspension due to privacy issues is not that bad, and they will give you the chance to prove the suspicion wrong if you would communicate with them. Unlike other platforms where they will put you on FORCED VACATION FOR REASONS THEY WILL NEVER TELL YOU.

I do not deny that I promote Paxful, but that doesn't mean they are paying me to do so. Unlike you, who posts where ever possible trying to tell people that I am being paid by paxful. You actually look more suspicious than I am.

Paxful is an open for all P2P Trading platform for bitcoin. Basically, scammers may be able to penetrate the platform. So, like any other similar platforms, it is up to you who you will trust. The good thing about Paxful is that when you get unlucky and mistakenly traded with a bad guy, you can easily access their support team 24/7 (EVEN WEEKENDS). Paxful's support team will always be there to provide assistance. The secret in order to get a favorable results when dealing with disputes in Paxful is to have a good reputation and records, in short be a good trader and don't do shit in the platform.

If you would check my history. I promote paxful. So what? Is that not allowed? If I look at your history. It's as if you're paid to be on reddit the whole day to comment on random posts? Then on the date the article I shared was published about localbitcoins losing trade volume and paxful gaining at the same period, you suddenly start accusing me and other users of being paid by paxful. Seriously? Is that how localbitcoins work? People complaint about your platform. I try to promote the platform I use. Fix your problems first before attacking users of other platforms.
@_date: 2018-09-18 10:06:56
Im not really sure what's your basis on your allegations. And by "we" do you mean your co-workers on localbitcoins or localnano? Is that your strategy? Trying to shut me down because I am using and promoting another platform? What a shameful strategy. Is that how desperate you are? Kindly tell your employer, that instead of spending money on paying you and whoever those "we" you're talking about, spend those money on improving your customer service so people would stop complaining about your company.

jokes on them maybe? i can now buy btc for a lower price.

First and foremost, I don't know what a shill means.. so there's that. I am merely promoting paxful so more people would use the platform. more traders = more trade opportunities. Also, I don't need to be paid by paxful for those specific reasons,  I can gain more money trading there than being paid by them. So you can go back to your beloved platform and stop spreading baseless rumors about me.

yeah. that's what i said. he went all in and lost. you can go all in and win by the way (win the round at least).

It's amazing that financial institutions are recognizing bitcoin as a mode of payment. Even tho the reason is that they know OP is into bitcoins. It just feels good as another person into bitcoin. It felt like another win for the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2018-09-18 07:03:46
it's funny how you got to comment here first before I do. how much is Localbitcoins paying you?

Lol. Well okay, that your choice. In case you didn't know, Coinbase hired a team of hackers. I've seen remarks from people experiencing bugs when they're about to delete their account. Isn't that alarming enough?
