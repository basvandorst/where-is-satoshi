Hello people,this is Mrs.Itireleng,the people came there not because of free food or free T-shirts.They didnt even know there was going to be food there or free T-shirts,if you follow our facebook page  you will see at the beginning of the presentation they were not wearing these T-shirts,the T-shirts were a surprise package .to make us uniform and equal.In this group,there are people who come from different backgrounds and It was and is still my dream to  make us all equal and united through Bitcoins. I had spend time day and night to teach people about Bitcoin,they were really excited and inspired about the possibility Bitcoin may bring into their lives. Don't let this dream die,i want to make a difference in the lives of these people including mine too.If you were to listen to the video of this meetup,you will see and hear people who want change,people who need to be like the rest of the world. Bitcoin is a possibility that can change the lives of people in this group and eventually reaching out to the remotest area of our country. PLEASE SUPPORT OUR MISSION AND WALK WITH US IN THIS JOURNEY OF BRINGING CHANGE. I received few BTC donations and i changed the lives of 5people in this group by helping them open wallets and giving them the coins.I now own 0.2 coins and this makes me proud that Bitcoin has given me the opportunity to change the lives of these people. It is my dream to change lives.Believe in this dream and walk every step of the way with me and see change. for donations and support of this project BTC 12b1DiJs7FpzGHtjhPnpZBfK6Tn9LvWrVv

thats a challenge,but as people are made aware of Bitcoins,next time am year i might be sharing a different story,a story of a country doing Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:14:31
i am aware of that,i believe i will get assistance and read more on how to do that
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:09:24
people like me,remember Africa is not a country but a continent,Let us not judge harshly and crucify the rest of Africa for the mistake done by some part of Africa.
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:12:44
it is easier to think negatively than positively because of what we see happening around us,if one genuinely seeks to bring a change it easy to doubt than believe the good inentions.I don't blame you for the thought
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:31:02
i know it's quick as for speed i really don't know,but it's something called 3G
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:51:08
some of these things will need me to have people who are well established in this area and iam banking on the assistance of my hero Alec Liu and South Africa's and any that can offer the edauction i need to be well versed on this.baby steps
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:52:37
i wouldn't really know i haven't thought of researching on this one
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:46:23
hello,thank you,send me a friend request at  or use my tweeter listed here.some of the things are gonna be one step at a time,at the moment iam trying to solicit help from some SA bitcoiners at  to help me with ideas making this dream a reality
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:22:16
i think so too,but how can this be turned into a reality,that's why a say it's not gonna be an easy road but i might just work as more people learn and read more on bitcoins,the idea of tourists coming with Bitcoins also is an excellent work,just have to make the right connections and also teaching people about their value
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:01:03
by holding my hands wanted to say i need your support in anywhere you can,you can help with ideas on how to carry my Bitcoin campaign better,you can sponsor our meetup,help in June when we will be helping the children's village through Bitcoin.You can donate to the cause,That will be holding my hand.
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:03:03
I am still learning my dear,i know i can use Mtgox i have an account there ..right now am using my page  and there are people who are showing interest and i can't forget to Thank Alec Liu because without him i would not have managed to take this to the people. If you can visit the page you will see there are people there asking questions and wanting to know more and the group will help them with that
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:57:28
baby steps is what i am taking,i don''t have to be too haste list i touch here and there and end up failing in my mission
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:31:44
thank you all for the constructive comments that you made,here in Botswana we are able to buy cheap imitation chinese smartphones ,the fact that we have many cellphone owners that is foundation enough for the cause of bringing Bitcoin use to success
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:17:35
ha ha ha killer one,windows 95?serioulsy.If this is the case thats why we are connecting with you so we can learn right and be better
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:59:07
i am willing to learn and your assistance is highly appreciated
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:27:40
are you truly an African,if you were then you will seek change
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:40:07
For those of you who have been following my mission i have been working hard to bring Bitcoin awareness in my country which although our next door neighbour country has Bitcoin accpeting shops and even an exchange ,many still have not heard and dont know what Bitcoin is. Its a long road and not an easy one especially that am a woman. Few women are into  Bitcoin.I managed to sponsor a meetup where i taught people about Bitcoin nd I still want to move around the country teaching on Bitcoin and the advantages thereof.
thank you and will appreciate sponsorship to carry this mission.1JYusNhBmjY9JUGK1VLZ99BYUYtFcuCJfj

A lot of people are into smart phones especially in towns and there are even more common among urban youth.I remember when when Blackberry came everyone wanted a blackberry and the chinese cashed a lot because those who could'nt afford the price of the real deal knew they could have a cheap one from the chinese shops.I think with this android and these QR what what  they will come in handy in support of Bitcoins. For some African markets i think translation can come in Handy as some African countries speak Portuguese,Afrikaans and many other languages but in Botswana I don't think is much of a neccesity as English as our formal and official language beside our Setswana.
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:29:14
the poor do not have internet access of course(except those who are in town like in Gaborone where they can find hotspots/free wifi places to connect through their cellphone-the chinese have brought a lot of cheap gadgets thereby enabling even those with little to buy replica 'smart' phones. To be honest i have never heard of the term flip phones is it the same as where people store airtime values and sell to people.I now we have things like'nzamela' or quick recharge and people use their cellphones to cell airtime to others

@_date: 2014-01-09 16:56:24
i live in Africa
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:20:47
you see the problem with the currencies the lay person does not have control over what happens.one has to just wait and see and suffer the result of what this is bringing to our lives. already the prices in commodities keep rising and rising and as for people's pay remain unchanged.we have seen how zimbabweans have suffered one has to jsut sit and pray that no matter how the situation is in our country is ,it does not go the extremes
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:35:32
1980 i was only 2years old wow.Botswana is a good country and thank you for your support
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:14:55
never get weary of doing something good,if your intentions are to bring good and change keep doing what you are doing. Give and change someone's life
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:42:51
thank you

@_date: 2014-01-15 21:12:37
I have really busy since our last talk.the facebook group has grown and many people are now showing interest and understanding.I have since got a lot of material/information support from a lot of Bitcoin groups onenfacebook e.g.Bitcoin Miami, Bitcoin SA and many others.I have been looking at their success and iam planning to organise a meetup and or workshop as we move forward innour Bitcoin campaign.Your help is still highly appreciated. 
THANK YOU, I WILL KEEP BRINGING YOU FEEDBACK ON.THE DEVELOPMENT
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:44:03
thank you
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:52:19
Remember when i did the interview with motherboard i wanted to sell this idea to my people,something i see could change lives including mine. If there is a friend who has it,it ended with him and the idea was not extended to the people.my mission is very simple,spread the gospel to the people,be an ambassador ,represent the people and let them be developed and embrace the change. one day in the future because of the interview i did with Alec Liu,we will see stores accepting Bitcoins in my country,we will see Bitcoins ATMs,this will see Batswana mining Bitcoins,we will know about them. It is possible
@_date: 2014-01-21 19:37:51
OUR FIRST MEETUP IS SCHEDULED THE 1ST OF FEBRUARY AND YOUR ASSISTANCE WILL BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED.
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:46:38
allow me to use this article as point of reference 
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:46:03
I call my self that because i have never heard of anyone openly talking about Bitcoins in my country,when i started this quest I posted in many Forums on facebook asking if anyone knows about Bitcoins and I never found anyone who says am here. someone from overseas wrote to me that he has a friend in Botswana who is Bitcoin miner and am still waiting to hook up with him. I might not be Botswana's first ,maybe,but i will be Botswana's first to help my people make a life with Bitcoins. we are always far behind in development and in technology because we do not share information,when someone discovers something that can be beneficial they want to accumulate as much as they can ,enrich themselves and the masses are left without knowledge.Teach the people and let them decide whether to embrace the change that you are bringing ,if they refuse it you would have tried.I am the first outspoken ambassador for the masses and if there is anyone there I will never know unless they say.
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:36:38
thank you. usually we use services that are brought by other countries and yes we have western union 
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:34:36
I have connected with a lot of people who understand the Bitcoin and therefore post the information on the facebook page so they can read.The community is okay,do you mean someone can attack me for Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:52:30
I have not used the Bitcoins at the moment,coz i want them not only to benefit me but to change the lives of others.When you look at the group i created  i want to empower people.why should people remain dependent when there is an alternative way to be independent. If i can have enough Bitcoins to change the life of even one person that will make me satsified. I heard about Bitcoin on a page Virtapay and i began to read to understand it and i saw potential in it changing the lives of people. I am a firm believer in it's potential, i am waiting for the day it will be used in my country like it is in our neighbour country South Africa.
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:26:23
I think outside the box,don't right off Africa,we are capable as anyone else,remember is a continent made of different countries,if one country fails it does not mean all the countries in Africa will fail.Africa needs people who can stand for change and i don't accept defeat for i know change is inevitable
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:14:13
i understand,negativity will just make me a stronger person,as a woman I have met a lot of challenge in trying to bring this change but i am not moved.I believe in this cause.I held our first Bitcoin Meetup and the response have been good,i look forward to change.
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:21:16
hello,tahk you to everyone who has reached out,this is me the owner of the video here and iam using my son's name as you see on my log in.when i posted this video and reached out to vice,i wanted to change the story of a lot of people through bitcoin,to me it gives hope. I am grateful,i will show the members of  that Bitcoin is not a scam and will on the 18th hold a mini training on Bitcoins,all these i will document. Above all tomorow i will go to Princess Marina hospital to try identify a child with the same heart problems as my son and and with your help i will reach out to the child,all in the name of Bitcoin.again all these i will document and send to motherboard vice. Thank you
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:13:03
you are elcome,now with my page a lot of people are willing to try using the Bitcoin,someone reached out to them and gave them hope for the future,its sad to see how disadvantaged we always are because no one is helpin,knowledge is not knowledge when it's not shared
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:59:38
ok,thank you
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:56:06
i believe soon i will have prominant people in my country wiho are owning these big companies and all wanting to encorporate the idea of Bitcoin in their services that will be the day i say the message has really went through.
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:43:04
i don't the price is an issue,it's the idea of Bitcoin that gives it the value,i have learnt about them and i hear also there is a new one which has just launched called Coinye.Its a good idea that people as seeing the future in technology.Like someone said one need to be careful not to fall into scams as some fake crypto currencies might emerge
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:57:20
thats can work too.giving bitcoin for charity is a start too.for it will give birth to exchanges and more platform to using Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-21 19:44:04
i have been in contact with Tristan and he has been helpful very much
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:06:37
it's called quick recharge. with mascom and orange mobile companies Batswana use the tswana language and they call it 'nzamela' to simple mean give me
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:15:49
Bitpesa in Kenya has been a success and i guess we can learn form them as we get more into Bitcoin usage
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:42:46
if you can follow my tweets on twitter you will see how i am trying to seek ideas on how this can be put in place,it's a long ride the way i see it,but as many people keep visiting the page on facebook the message is spread and some are really inquisitive and keen to understand this things am trying to make them consider 
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:01:59
first people have to know what a Bitcoin is before we can talk about the exchange and use of such.People are questioning the use of first Bitcoin lady.If you read the article ,it is my quest and desire to extend this knowledge to the people,when people have knowledge then when we bring something new to them they don't get all confused and scared and are able to embrace the change. 5 years i believe Batswana will be well versed in this and we might just have miners here
@_date: 2014-03-29 20:21:37
i loved your discussion and would like to discuss this more with you,can i have your Email.mine is bitcoinbotswanaambassador

@_date: 2014-03-08 22:04:13
its how you see it,i can't change your mind but certain comments are irrelevant especially to this discussion.Bitcoin community is about respect and love, 
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:04:51
Right now mt target is my country Botswana as other African countries like South Africa and Kenya are already in and I heard someone from Namibia also say there are right in it too
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:53:49
thank you,i appreciate. Life in Botswana is very peaceful,we are a peace loving country but like any other country which depends so much on other countries for resources life can be a bit tough
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:07:40
the fact that i am communicating with you about Bitcoin shows just how much we are ready to join the global village,we might not be so technical but we need to connect to the rest of the world
