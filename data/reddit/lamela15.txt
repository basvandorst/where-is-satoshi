Spot on. For companies what matters over the long run is their market cap, not their share price.
Stock splits or 'halving' can create some shorter-run value, but it's often temporary and mean-reverting.

I agree to an extent. Definitely read some academic research on this if you're interested. There are a few key ones that outline how, actually, retail banks can be as risky, as investment banks, partly because they may be more tempted to offer mortgages over ploughing money into and investment activities if they were a universal bank. That leads to more systemic risk, rather than less - the diversification argument.
Moreover, investment banks are AS important as retail banks. The likes of Morgan Stanley, for example. The results of any investment bank collapse would be pretty horrific. I understand the reason for functional or full separation, but confidence is a funny thing in the markets, and I doubt that there would even be much confidence in a fully separated retail bank if there were a string of investment bank failures. The average knowledge of the casual person on this matter is next to non-existent, so absolutely could still have similar manifestations as 2008/9 in the markets or through bank runs

Wait is that a prediction graph?
If so, that is absolute lunacy. Charting some precise patterns is absolutely useless

Absolutely no guarantees of that. It's like the stock market. A company has a certain number of shares in issue at any point in time - does that mean the share price will keep rising?
Nope, it depends on demand levels, and what people are willing to pay. Could absolutely go either way, and no-one can really tell you which way, with any level of certainty

Yes and that's a guess... All it takes is a system failure,, some regulatory change, etc. and that theory breaks down. There have been loads of new competitors coming out in the last 2 years alone.
it's literally exactly the same with stocks. You can have a theory, and a strong idea of where it might go, but when there is 'efficient market hypothesis', it's hard to know what is priced in already. EMH says that in liquid items that are well traded, and well known, all currently known expectations are priced into the market.
Pretty sure most bitcoin holders know what you've stated, so that alone is unlikely to drive upside

Perhaps missing the point that there is a near 0% chance Deutsche will be allowed to fail.
A lot has changed regarding regulators/central banks and their attitude towards banks in distress. Worst case scenario nowadays wouldn't be a Lehman's, but what they tout in the industry nowadays as an 'orderly resolution', which protects most creditors
