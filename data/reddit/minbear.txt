Dont use kraken, this is worst exchange i used so far. EVERY, i repeat every time there's a rise/down on btc price the exchange is dead/super slow. Canceling order takes 3 minutes, placing new order 3 minutes and around 10 tries. And i dont really mean that it happened "just" few times,  it happens all the time - they just do nothing about it.
My theory is that they profit themselfs by the fact that exchange is down/unusable during most BTC movement. I will post this in every post about kraken, so maybe they will hire developers to fix it. This problem is present for around one year? How can you trust a company which provides service that does not work, when it should? Traffic issues might be present, but what's most suprising and showing how they care about this business - is the fact that they do absolutely NOTHING about it. Their exchange engine is worst of 8 exchanges i tried so far in terms of performance.

This subreddit is bad place to ask. Here everyone will tell you that Bitcoin wilk be rising 24/7. The price will drop. Not quickly but if you read forums and analyze previous bulls then you know it's often 30% drop. I sold at 6.4 and 6.8. Be patient. 
You see we are already going lower and lower. 
Expect 5.0-6

I think you're not familiar with trading then. Yes it's possible to sell to yourself on some exchanges. You need to have balance in cash and in btc. This process even has it's own name - i dont remember atm. google.
Also if it's not possible on particiular exchange then it's coordinated with another whale account ;) One setups wall, second buys.

Exactly, and this is what is happening now.

There's no sell order at 8500 and it doesn't move. It's called hidden order. So in case of 8500, there was hidden sell order of huge amount of btcs.
Such hidden orders are used atm to avoid crash and close price in so called "channel". One hidden order is put below to prevent crash and another one up to prevent breakout.
My post is based on observation of orderbook during period of few hours.

Nothing, because it's unregulated we can make quite a lot of money. But here we see the danger ;)

They will push price up at critical resistance points to give "signal". The masses will drive price up, same as they did from 15 to 20k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:37:37
When you push price down to rebuy lower using hidden orders on that scale, well... nothing else comes up ;)

Which chart you mean?
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:03:58
They push price down to cause panic (this cost them money). When there's enough panic, people start selling - and they put buy orders.
They will even put fake 1000 btc buy wall, just so people think that the falling will stop here. Then they will take down the wall by selling btc to themselfs. So people lose hope and panic starts again.
Nothing complicated.

Glad you see it.
Yes, i agree it's automated. The price points are changed rapidly sometimes at 1m interval and sometimes every 15m.
Look at this chart and highs "H" 1m.... :))
"Breakout wall":
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:47:33
Yes, you're right. It's waste of fees but it's psychology. 
They put 1.3k buy wall (fake support), people think that it will stop the price falling. Then they dump the wall "naturally" by throwing a lot of orders on it or they just remove it once the price is very close to it.
People lose hope and start selling even more, because they think that a lot of other people are selling and nothing can stop the trend.

1. Yes negative income but they will buy back on lower price -&gt; positive income. You have to invest to bring price down. Dont forget they will also pump price in months probabbly, it's long term operation not short term.
3. Yes, they put buy wall. Then they sell btc they have and buy at the same time. It's possible. Imagine you have cash for 20 btc and 20 btc. You put buy order for 20 btc then you sell 20 btc to yourself.
4. You're starting to sell, and they're putting buy orders. They spend 10k btc to put price down and they'll buy 30k btc because of panic at lower prices.

This is arrest is highly related to MtGox.
"We won't beat around the bush with it: Vinnik is our chief suspect for involvement in the MtGox theft (or the laundering of the proceeds thereof). This is the result of years of patient work, and these findings were surely independently uncovered by other investigators as well. Everyone who worked on the case have patiently kept quiet while forwarding findings to law enforcement, so as not to tip suspects off and to maximize the chances of arrests."
