I know this will have been posted before, but with many new members of the community  not knowing what cold storage and paper wallets are, I think this is a greatly informative and useful site.

I see...
Sorry I can't help, but good luck, I'd like to know the solution myself since I am planning on using my 25GH/s BFL Single to solo mine for fun - lotto style of course!

anyone used Meetpays recently? I'm unable to log in - Is it just me?

Also - you don't have to buy anything from the site (they sell little stickers and plastic bags to keep them in)
I created mine on a Linux Live CD, using the downloadable version of the site.
I then printed out, folded them up and laminated them.

This site is a great idea if it can help spread the adoption of crypto's and educate more people about their benefits.
My referral link if anyone wants to join via me - Thanks !

from reading the other posts, it appears to be spam of some sort. Not really anything to worry about as it seems unlikely the transactions will ever be confirmed and included in a block, so will basically drop off as if they never happened

Today I received a number of 1 satoshi payments from addresses:
I don't know if this is some sort of transaction spam, an attack on me or the network, or a tracing transaction sent to trace where I send my bitcoin next.
Has anyone else experienced this, as looking on Blockchain I can see thousands of other addresses received these transactions.
What worries me most about this is the address which received all these payments is one of my paper wallets used for cold storage, I have sent bitcoin to this address before so it will have been seen on blockchain, but I'm wondering what this is all about...

Yeah I'm getting the OOOPS too. I'll just need to try elsewhere... Not sure who to trust right now

I've tried solo mining BBQcoins in the past with my scrypt based rig and it appeared like nothing was happening until it found a block. I know this isn't great help, but maybe you could try solo mining a SHA-256 coin which has a low difficulty where there is the likelihood of finding several blocks per hour - then replicate what you done there with Bitcoin.

Meetpays.com have allowed purchase of Bitcoins by credit card for a good 6 months at least - not sure how they handle chargebacks etc.
They do charge more than the current market rate, so maybe that's parly how they protect themselves...

thanks - I tried a search on the whole address and couldn't see any other threads - my bad
