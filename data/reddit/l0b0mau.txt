A pound of feathers because you also have to consider the weight of what you did to the poor birds

Per year.
But if you hodl your coins longer than a year, the gains are all taxfree. They look at them with the fifo principle.
Seems like the german gvmt just wants the best for rhe people and create hodlers instead of speculants ;)

You are right! Thanks for catching the issue right away. There was a typo in the code.  
It's corrected now :)

thanks for your insomnia math :)  
Indeed there was an issue because I wanted to have the same diameter to thickness ratio as some gold coins and had a typo in there. Now I went back to the simplest math and the size should work out now.  
Thanks  a lot for catching the error!

Double thanks for  [keeping a great and clean sub =)

Great idea :)  
There is now the Vienna Philharmonic as the comparable standard coin implemented.  
It is already chronologically sorted, but from right to left, so the current one is the first you see. Especially on the mobile view it can be anoying to scroll around.
