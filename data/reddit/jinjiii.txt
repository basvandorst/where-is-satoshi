Totally agree. It is definitely not the end to just increase your blocksize to GB blocks. Lightning and other solutions are going to happen and help but shouldn't it be a combination of both? I could imagine having 10MB Blocks and Lightning in a couple of years and with other things like sharding or sidechains

Then they shouldn't use a fullnode. A normal person, if we ever get mass adoption, won't have a fullnode anyway.. to think that is kind of delusional, because as you said, it takes days to get started even without mass adoption.
Being a fullnode is not something you have to be and that it takes days to become a fullnode is a problem you'll have in the end no matter the blocksize. That is by definition how a blockchain works: everybody stores the whole ledger. You get around that if enough people store the whole ledger to keep it decentralised.

I agree. I mean Lightning is awesome but why keep the Blocksize artificially small? I mean I get it. 8 MB might be an overkill at first, so don't go all BCH but why not up it to 2 or 3 MB?
I feel like this discussion is like I don't want a faster engine for my car because I wait for a rocket.. But even if the rocket arrives it won't fix the issue at hand and has a different purpose. Lightning, as far as I understand it (correct me if I'm wrong), will only be used for high volume merchants or anything that interacts with them directly or in their name such as Bitpay. What if I want to send a friend of mine some bits? Lightning might ease but we won't use it for EVERYTHING, do we?
We could also lower the blocktime from 10 mins to like 5 mins. As long as we don't go the ethereum route with implementing GHOST, we are limited anyway because of Orphans, right?
