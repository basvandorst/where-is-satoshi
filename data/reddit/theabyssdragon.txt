1. Use 2FA
2. Encrypt your backups
3. ???
4. Profit!

You could always trade your dogecoin for bitcoin.

I understand what you *intended* to say. But that doesn't change my question. If they priced in USD, but accepted BTC as payment, why shouldn't the refund be in USD?

You are contradicting yourself. If the "local currency" is USD, then why should the refund be in bitcoins?

Use bitcoin-qt, electrum, armory, or any number of other software wallets that run on your own computer, not someone elses server.

Same here. My wallet is encrypted and is stored in an encrypted TrueCrypt container. That container sits with the rest of my documents and is easy enough to mount/unmount when needed.
On top of that, my off-site backups are also encrypted, using a third/separate passphrase. I'm not too concerned about anyone getting access to my private key.

You would acquire the keys by way of moving the coins to your own wallet.

Where's the complexity? You copy/paste, scan, or click a btc address, type in the amount of coin and a memo, then hit send.

This. It doesn't matter how good or bad the protocol is when you write your own faulty software.

This doesn't make any sense. How can one chain be more valuable than another if you can transfer between them 1:1 at will?

Also a valid point. Though I have autofill disabled completely, it tends to be more annoying than helpful.

It's officially "Mount Gox." I've only heard "Empty Gox" as a joke, referring to their empty vault.

Actually it's called plus addressing, and sadly many websites do not accept + as a valid email character.
Sieve is a mail filter, which happens to support plus addressing.

I don't treat "offline" how most in the community do. I keep my wallet (which has encrypted private keys) in an encrypted TrueCrypt container, which effectively barricades it from the outside world. So in order to access my private keys, you'd have to first decrypt the container, then decrypt the keys themselves. I also make sure this container is backed up in several locations to avoid losing it to disaster.
However, I use a secure linux distribution and am a careful web surfer. So I don't worry about keyloggers snagging my encryption keys.

To be clear: are we earning interest in bitcoin or fiat?

I believe any US-based financial institution is required to comply. Basically, if you have a high volume account and have transactions that could subjectively be considered suspicious, they are required to investigate.

I agree with you, but your use case requires a smart device like a phone. Not a static NFC tag as presented here.
For two-way communication, NFC is pretty amazing.
