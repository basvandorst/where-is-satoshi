I was *seriously* considering this.
Also: yelling.

Thanks! That's a better RES tag than "gox leaker"...

Much like the silk road shutdown, it's another bad, albeit big, actor going away. Seems like good news to me.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:07:12
Fuck that, I'm buying.
@_date: 2014-08-29 21:06:27
Good thought, no one around though.

Neat, I just got mine! Thanks to the new pyramid joiners!
@_date: 2013-08-22 13:25:43
No, don't boycott them! I need other people to pitch into the pyramid scheme so I can get my damned equipment one year...

This is probably the absolute worst time to try to get into mining as a newcomer.

I came here looking for an answer to this, I don't understand why you're downvoted. Perhaps she meant the Casascius coins? Even so, that's a bit too niche to casually refer to as "physician Bitcoins"...

I just got an email saying my Jalapeño just shipped. Tracking number and everything. I almost fainted. 
About a year off...

How long does it take for a Paypal/Visa/MC transaction to "confirm"? 30 days or so? By which I mean, how long before they can no longer choose to chargeback the purchase due to some proclaimed fraud?
With Bitcoin there should it should be 10-30 minutes, and that's just to protect against a double-spend. (To be fair, it's less cool on the purchaser's side... there is no recourse if you're defrauded spending bitcoin, other than street justice).
