I had to shut my gpu miner down for the summer with the dip. The miner plus running the hvac to compensate burns more money than it makes currently. Once it gets cooler tho ill fire them back up. We got down to the mid teens (F) here last winter and with the miners running i only burned $15 of natural gas total a month. Thats with a gas stove and dryer.
Well i told you that story to tell you this one. I was thinking. Would hash difficulty ever become easier if power went down? If thousands of others like me suddenly thought it wasnt profitable and shut down for a few months would that cause the system to make the hash easier to maintain the 10 minute payout or does it only go one way?

How is coinbase not working for you?
Google comes back with 3 BTC ATM locations in NYC.

I would suggest not mining while gaming. I have a evga 1080 and 1070 in my game rig. The 1070 ill mine with when the computer is idle. When i game without mining my 1080 stays round 65c. If i keep the 1070 hashing while i game it puts off so much heat that my 1080 will raise up near 78c. Just 2 cents of my own i prefer not to bite the hand i game with. As per Excavator i have no info to suggest.

I know that. Look into the post further. All my alt coins values are mirroring BTC. I get paid in etherium, zcash, raven etc then i convert it to btc because its more openly accepted. But thats not the point. If etherium for example isnt profitable to mine anymore and the amount of miners working it falls to the small percentage of the guys who have solar on the roof or live by a hydro dam how does that affect the overall performance of that chain. Is that when the difficulty of the chain rolls itself back to maintain the 10 minute payout so those left mining are hashing more per second because its become easier. To my limited viewpoint this means an ongoing rollercoaster of ups and downs.

Now the difficulty dropping slightly in theory means more profit for pool miners? Meaning the payouts for those left mining get higher and possibly maintaining a certain level of value?

Im not, im a miner.

Hey guys, get ready its about to soar today. I just had to cash out to pay bills....
@_date: 2018-11-04 18:07:58
Ill let yall know when i have to do it again. XD
@_date: 2018-11-04 18:05:42
Because i hold hoping the value goes up and it never does and the second i have to cash out every goddamn time it jumps up.

I tried but within 3 hours it was down by 25%
These things lose value quickly, i dont recommend for long term investment.

Well im a fatty so ice cream cakes are just as valuable. XD

Open a bank account to link. Its only for crypto. Go to coinbase and open an account and link it to that bank account. Get a pool like nicehash or betterhash etc etc. Disable your virus scanner. Let the pool benchmark your shit. Start it hashing. However long it takes to get 0.001 btc is when you can cash out. Takes me about a week. With a single 1070 it may take you a month. It "should" mine more than the electricity consumption but get a killawatt monitor to make sure. Compare that to your electric bill. Disassemble your 1070, wipe the nvidia goop and apply artic silver. Every little bit helps. Download Precision XOC for tweaking memory speed and power consumption. Some coins do better with less power or more memory speed. Download a good temp monitor you can keep an eye on everything with. Keep it cool as possible. Highest my 1070s get to is 70c but mines in an open rig with a wind tunnel. As long as you can remove the heat itll last a long time. Ive had 8 1070's going steady for about 2 years now 24/7.
You can then either cash out at payout or you can keave the btc in coinbase and wait till the value goes up. Sell/buy, transfer around.
