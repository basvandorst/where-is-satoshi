Doubled your money on a 3% climb?

Okay, so:
1) Have you ever been there? Have you witnessed first hand how the birds are treated? Have you been informed of their policies of rescuing owls and the treatment they receive upon arrival?
2) Have you literally ever seen any other bird in captivity, like falcons or eagles that are being rehabbed?
These questions are clearly rhetorical, because I know your answer to them both is a resounding “no.” Go take your faux outrage and do something useful with it.

How is it a shitty thing to do to a bird? We walk our dogs on leashes. Are you up in arms about that too, or are you just here to start banal arguments?

So they don’t fly away, or out the door, I assume. Like all animals, owls are territorial and some do not like others. When I was at this exact cafe and holding one of the owls, I was told to stay away from other owls because they do not get along.

Was just gonna say, this looks like it’s from Akiba Fukurou! I was there a year and a half ago. The owls seemed very well treated and taken care of, from my casual eye.

How do you manually generate a new address? From the app, I've gone to the "accounts" page and selected on BTC Wallet. When I select the icon on the upper right hand and press "show address," it shows an address starting with 1, but I don't see the option to generate a new one.

I don’t understand the downvotes. A question was asked, you answered. People are weird.
