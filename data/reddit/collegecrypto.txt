We have a decentralized oracle solution and we do not make markets. There is no one entity reporting on the outcome of events, instead there are thousands and anyone in the world can be the bookie. Check it out: 
We have spoken to folks at BetFair who are interested in using Augur as an odds-making engine, as the global nature of the software has the potential to create better liquidity/volume than they currently have.

You can trade your winnings for our love for helping us build the world's most powerful prediction engine. But alas, I'm afraid play money can't win you anything (although you used to be able to steal test ether from our system!)

A way to rebuild SWIFT, more accurately.

Sounds interesting! You or they should shoot me an email! jeremy

AI, historically, has not been great at predicting the future. But to be quite honest, the implications for machine learning with Augur are fairly terrifying. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 00:11:26
It's "gambling", as you word it, turned into a way to predict the future. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 01:26:25
The likelihood of an event occurring is determined by the price assigned by those betting on the outcome. So if more people people believe Hillary will be president, "yes" shares might cost 60¢ and "no" shares would correspondingly cost 40¢. Thus in a market with volume and liquidity, the 60¢ can be interpreted as the likelihood of the event occurring.

She actually just sat down next to me at a conference and I couldn't bring myself to say anything so I sat up and walked away. I stand by my assertion of her financial destructiveness, although I cannot claim to know exactly what she is doing. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:05:39
Levitate Media! I was super impressed with them. They specialize in tech company explainers. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 00:11:44
That is the broadest definition I've ever read about gambling. So I suppose that would include space flight, driving a vehicle, drinking alcohol. If that's the case, sure, Augur is gambling. See above.

You can try our Alpha now here: 
Full launch should be in Q4 '15 or Q1 '16 depending on how security audits go!

It's as unfortunate to you as it is to me! But if anyone tells you that banks or Blythe Masters give a *flying fuck* about Bitcoin or decentralization, they are batshit crazy and you should never listen to them again. These guys aren't stupid, they are going to cherry pick every innovation we make and reappropriate it whenever possible, sadly. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:40:26
We're coin-agnostic. Bitcoin as soon as sidechains are implemented, stablecoin/ether for the time being. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:23:13
Yes, despite what many bitcoiners would like to have you believe, distributed ledgers *are* possible without tokens (this is how Ripple was developed before they introduced their XRP scam.) Thus, if you can create an improved, frictionless means of transacting and moving assets, preferably *not* in a totally decentralized way (i.e. not w/ a blockchain), you have created exactly what the banks have been looking for in Bitcoin. I was with the HyperLedger guys yesterday, and am a big fan of the team. But Blythe scares me, and this, more or less, signals the end of institutional finance's intrigue with Bitcoin's blockchain :/ *Let the downvoting commence*
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:48:39
They are not, however, the antithesis of banking. The distributed ledger (blockchains and others) has an appeal that extends beyond the initial bitcoin demographic and it has drawn in interest that is far away from decentralization.
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:53:03
Blythe Masters is the definition of an economic hitwoman or terrorist. So yes, that is exactly what we should expect... until proven otherwise (which on a scale of 1 to improbable would break the Richter scale.)

Thank you! 
@_date: 2015-06-24 00:26:50
lul. Well played.
@_date: 2014-11-14 06:44:23
I'm totally on the same page. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:10:57
These are the sort of initiatives necessary to create a sustainable bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 04:51:02
Indeed! That's where the CCN was founded and where I attended for less than nine months! Thank you
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:36:06
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:02:37
AMAZING. Looks like I'm going to have to start a ChangeTip account and begin using this website more often! Tomorrow is going to be fun. Please be sure to introduce yourself afterwards. I'll be wandering around for the rest of the conference, most likely evangelizing. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:00:29
I went to a dinner party with the student organizers, many of whom had been taught by the professor, and I watched as slowly everything they had been taught to believe about bitcoin, and probably money, unraveled as I explained how the tech really works. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 12:21:49
Charlie Shrem is responsible for bringing untold numbers of people into the Bitcoin space, both through his company and through his evangelism. Regardless of what you may think of him as a person, few people have done more to raise awareness for Bitcoin (albeit negative, at times). He is among the best cryptocurrency communicators and a good guy, and that's why he will be at this event. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:15:35
That was me. Thank you for the feedback. Watching the video, admittedly, caused me to cringe at times. I definitely  appeared presumptuous. In my defense, there were some cuties in 
the audience I was trying to impress ;p
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:47:18
Me too!
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:55:47
Bruce, he came, and brought some troops with him! We'll see how the quality of the video turns out, but Reddit has really come through on this one. I just even purchased a cupcake in Omaha with bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:02:23
The room was at capacity!
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:40:15
I'll take tips once I consult with our attorney about how to best collect and expend the funds. Since our nonprofit is 501(c)(3)-pending, we have to be incredibly careful in how we deal with money, even small tips in magical internet money!

What's up, Babyshaker?
We are juniors at the University of Michigan and in the midst of creating a nationwide bitcoin/altcoin organization, the College Cryptocurrency Network. 
We are dedicated to forming a robust network of college clubs for cryptocurrency education, mining, trading, and start-ups. We already have chapters at MIT, Stanford, Northeastern, and several other institutions. We are on the cusp of being endorsed by the Bitcoin Foundation. 
Here are a few of our online mediums: 
Our website goes live tonight or tomorrow: collegecrypto.org.
We have also been written up in various national syndications (before creating the org):
We would love to get the Simon Fraser meetup involved and provide you with the resources to move forward with greater ease. 
We look forward to hearing back from you!
You can reach us on social media or at jeremy
All the best,
Jeremy Gardner &amp; Daniel Bloch
Founders, College Cryptocurrency Network

 We weren't thrilled by CoinTelegraph's failure to reach out to us. There were lots of factual errors in the article, but all press is good press, right? 
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:33:55
We can look into making this happen. Unfortunately, it is up to each speaker to decide, so it may be a bit of an undertaking. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:35:47
I (Jeremy G.) just asked one of the organizers to email all the speakers. Will try to keep this thread updated.
