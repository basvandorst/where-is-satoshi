Good, be obsessed the the concept, the protocol, the possibilities, but not the price.  The more you understand the potential of Bitcoin, the more daily price fluctuations seem like trivial noise.


Maybe, but lately the cost of a transaction is about $90.  That is heavily subsidized by inflation (the 25 bitcoin block reward) so you only pay less than $1.  Is the system sustainable, will total transaction fees balance the declining inflation?   
What happens as Asic mining grows and grows, will there be power blackouts in Chinese cities.  Will there be power stations built just to feed electricity to mining operations?  
Bitcoin makes it possible to convert cheap electricity to a commodity that can be instantly sold worldwide.  That is new.

Oh, yes.  Ethereum being reactive.  Like Counterparty got under their skin or something.  Seems a little reactive and defensive, doncha think?
But I'm just here for fun.  I am not an Ethereum scholar. 
Still, seems like if Ethereum was the greatest thing since sliced bread, you would think people would want to keep it to themselves so they could grab more before the price is bid up.  If there was a market, of course.  Actually I think it would be great if the Ethereum community would keep the secret all to themselves.   Please.

Sorry, I was unclear.  My ebay example is relevant because I was too patient, it has gone beyond Ebay/Paypal's time limit.  So unfortunately for the scammer it has become personal.  I don't need the money back, I do need to know a lesson has been learned: Bad behavior has tangible consequences.  
I'm realizing that you and I are the tiny minority.  Most people really are incredibly passive and desperately avoid confrontation, or even unpleasant human interaction.
Maybe I just have a low tolerance for bad behavior.  For example, if you cut in front of me in a line... you will feel my hand on your shoulder, I will politely ask if there is an emergency before escalating.  
But, I guess 98% of people will try to ignore anyone who cuts in line.  I thing you helped me understand: because the Bitcoin uber-geek community is likely to be even more passive than average.  Financial loss is unpleasant but a chance of personal conflict is abhorrent.

Yes, there is definitely money to be made in Bitcoin arbitrage.
But Arbitrage means you sell in one place and buy in a different place...at the same time.   That means you already have assets in both places, and there is the problem... exchanges disappear, steal the money, get hacked, get funds confiscated by Goverments.... 
And when you Aribitrage you are moving lots of assets around.  That makes you very interesting to governments and banks, do you want more attention?  You will be very interesting if you suddenly have 10 times more cash flowing through your personal bank account.
Did you do arbitrage before Bitcoin?

I have another perspective.  If you write it off and get on with your life, that encourages the next scam artist, or act of Gross Negligence. 
Somebody ripped me off for $285 on Ebay.  The money is not a problem, their behavior is.  I was patient and gave them every chance to make it right.  Now I will make an example of them.  Simple cause and effect helps people learn.   No cause and effect encourages bad behavior.

But you can definitely influence a $5 billion market.  For example, price is a big driver of adoption.  Hold the price down, slow adoption.... then start the propanda
Bitcoin needs to get from $5 billion to $100 billion.  Price growth needs new people and institutions.  Slander Bitcoin enough... make it unmentionable.  Make the masses avoid it the same way they would avoid [fecal implants](   Who cares if it has a 90% success rate it is incredibly distasteful.

Myceilium is GREAT.  You guys have raised the bar for all other wallets.  Minor suggestings:
1. Allow users to press and hold an "Address" to send to that address.  That is how I send emails.  Choose the receiver first, then write the message.
2. It might be great to have a "scan" button right on the opening screen, because often that is what I want to do,
scan a QR Code and send Bitcoins.  No extra screens or menus needed.  Or maybe make it option in settings, when the app is opened it automatically scans for a QR code for 2 seconds.  THAT would make paying VERY fast.  One touch to open Myceilium and auto-scan, one touch to confirm payment.  Done!

Hey, thanks for taking the time to answer.  You make good arguments and I understand much better where you are coming from.  You are not just trolling, you make some damn good points.


That is so true that I laughed.  But it is not funny if it is your nest egg.


That is a pretty good point too.  And I'm sure you know the difference between cold storage and a hot wallet.  You are making point and it is a good one.  There are solutions (offline signed transactions, 2FA) but it can be tedious stuff to deal with.  There is some hope that this will get more bullet proof with hardware wallets.  But that is another gadget to buy and deal with.
How about the Elephant in the room: store of value
5. Last year Gold was not a very good store of value compared to Bitcoin.  The number of Bitcoin Users and Merchants continues to grow... about 2.5% per week lately, that growth eventually might show up as an increase in Bitcoin Price this year.  Bitcoin ~might~ go up 10x while gold is...stable
Certainly Gold has had extraordinary volatility in the past, is your concern that Bitcoin really could go to Zero but Gold never will.  I would agree with that, Bitcoin is definitely high risk, ~maybe~ high reward.
Risk is a bitch to quantify, we each make our best guess. On a risk adjusted basis I prefer to invest more in Bitcoin than in Gold.  Do you hold any Bitcoin?  The blockchain.info wallet does a pretty good job of securing coins, have you tried it?  The forced 2 factor authentication and forced minimum password security is getting closer to idiot proof.
A last thought, I like to have a little bit of unsecured Bitcoin on my computers.  Call it a cheap early warning system, if my computer security sucks those coins will disappear.  So far, they have not moved, maybe there is still a chance for Bitcoin.

Mark can start with some damn good reasons why both Bitcoins and Fiat are missing.  And a plan for how he going to spend the rest of his Medically extended life repaying everyone, like Methuselah on a permanent triple espresso bender! 
The twaddle speak that has been come out of his coffee stained pie hole is unacceptable.  
If it was MY money that he lost then I would encourage him to take personal responsibility, politely of course.  He can give up soaplands, sorry Mark... no more happy endings for you.
He can empty his bank account, sell all assets, and get a job and a second job.  He can move out of his upscale apartment, and live under a blue tarp, it is a Japanese tradition when you screw up so bad that your family is embarrassed to be around you.
Even a caffeine saturated kidney has to be worth something (ok, for the humor impaired, that was a joke)

You are right, I am NOT suggesting a course of action for you.  I lost $2000 on a Bitcoin exchange.  Not enough to make it worth a special trip to that western country, but if I am in the neighborhood I will definitely visit the owner and give him a chance to make it right.  My shitlist does not have a statue of limitations.  And saying "I was hacked" is less acceptable than "the dog ate my homework"  You take my money, you are responsible, personally.
Last year I few to Japan to check out Mtgox, didn't like it.   So I am lucky I don't have a dog in this fight.  If I am going to trust somebody with a pile of money I need to meet them in person, no hiding being the corporation B.S.  If I had lost more than 
$10,000 I would be flying to Japan to chat with Mark.
$50,000 I would be hiring a investigator.
$100,000 I would be moving to Japan, getting an apartment in his building and greeting Mark every morning with a hot Dessert Coffee.

You probably know that they delayed the "IPO" because there was so much criticism that they were being greedy pigs.  
Counterparty by comparison is much simpler, and is working now.   You can use the DEX (Decentralized Exchange) right now.  And they used Proof of Burn, which seems to be the fairest possible way to "IPO".
Counterparty seems to putting all there time into writing the code instead of write blogs, white papers, documents and marketing hype.
Counterparty developers say the are trying to make it simple and robust.  Yet they have had a couple of nasty bugs.  It is still alpha, only released in Janurary 2014. Ethereum by comparison seems tremendously more complex... I wonder if Etherem will spend years trying to get the bugs worked out and the security locked down.

Well, I like your arguments about Bitcoin. "Magical internet money that can disappear while you are holding in your hand."  That sums it up pretty well.  Yeah, there are some geeky solutions, but the fact is Bitcoin is not ready for Grandma, and you are right to warn people.  My problem is... If I wait until Bitcoin is ready... the price will be $10000.
Bitcoin is still beta, and this forum is stuffed full of new people, 100,000 in the last year and it seems like half of them are just here for the drama.  And it seems like it will keep growing, last time I checked there were over 300 Alt-Coins!  Bitcoin has opened the floodgates for non government currencies.  Power to the people, including the power to instantly fuckup your own finances.
With great power comes great responsibility, ha ha.
Back to gold, I still like gold.  Solid, Tangible, Heavy.  I have tried testing gold for density, drop it in water, measure the volume displaced.  But you have to be REALLY precise and accurate because the density of Tungsten is so close, just the surface tension of water can mess up the results.  Xray testing doesn't seem practical for home use, and I am trying to avoid trust.  I want to test it myself.  
Chemical tests are good for the surface.

True but da smart people just figured out how to implement HD wallets recently.  Maybe we should ask Satoshi why full anonymity was not baked in from day one.
He probably had a pretty good reason, right?
Maybe something about letting a radical new currency get a little traction before antagonizing the dark forces.   
I think it would be neat if Mycelium had Coinjoin built in, but that is just because I am lazy.
I also think it would be neat if Mycelium automatically routed through Tor, but again that is cuz I am lazy.

Ethereum will kill itself, sucked down by the founders greed, and more gaping security holes than unpatched Windows 95.
Ethereum is like Javascript for money, and we know how safe and secure Javascript has been, NOT
So it is a Security nightmare, but they got that figured out 'cause they are gonna have a really good sandbox, and maybe a Virtual Machine, yeah, yeah, that's the ticket!
And don't worry....virii and malware, and other nasties have to pay for memory space and cpu cycles. Tax the parasites to death, yeah, yeah, that will work. Unlimited scripting language for financial transactons, seems like a breeding ground for exotic new financial diseases.
And speaking of disease, Team Ethererum is gonna unleash Quantitative Easing (QE) to pay themselves, just like the United States Government. But it is OK because they are telling you in advance: when they get enough "investors" they devalue the shares by 50%. Because you can't write good code eating oatmeal.
The team is proud of their really really smart people, except they weren't quite smart enough to buy a bunch of Bitcoin last year at $13, but they are are smart enough to ask for YOUR Bitcoins. Just send 30,000 Bitcoin now and you will get a lottery ticket, plus all the risk of running Silkroad 3.0 on your home computer, and a smart contract that guarantees they won't spend the premine on hookers and blow. Hurry, supplies limited! Don't send fiat, they don't want that stuff. And don't send alt-coins, they are only interested in your Bitcoins.
Ethereum, powered by OPB (Other People's Bitcoin)
Did Satoshi ask for $30 million worth of gold because he wrote a white paper, but needed a new house and Lamborghini to polish the code?
Seems like everybody who can code "Hello World" calls themselves a developer. If the "developers" really believe in their idea, lets see them take some risk, get some skin in the game, no money? Fine, work a double shift at McDonalds, it will help you appreciate the value of 30,000 Bitcoins.
People who handle their finances loosely tend to need lots of other people's money. And people like that should not be given $30 million worth of Bitcoins unless you need big tax deductions! There is a reason lottery winners have a strong pattern of going broke. Team Ethereum is not asking for a little seed capital. $30 million is not seed capital, it is "fuck you" money.
When do we get to see the credit reports for the individuals in Team Ethereum? Is it time to do a detailed background check on these guys? Any criminal history we should know about?

I like a harsh &amp; critical look at Bitcoin.
And I like the simple comparison with gold. 
I have gold.. bars and coins.  They are not convenient to travel with, and there are some trust issues.  
1. I have to become a damn expert on coins or trust a third party to properly grade and slab the coins.  I have a couple of fake St. Gaudens.  Want to buy them?  
2. Gold bars are troublesome, too easy to load them with tungsten.  I am not a metallurgist!  I am not aware of a simple easy way to be 99.99% sure my gold is pure gold.  Chain-of-Custody?  Hmmm, reminds me of the Blockchain.
3. How much gold can you wear/carry on a daily basis?
Unless you are touching it right now isn't there some doubt that you still control it.  Maybe my Vault will be empty when I get home.  Maybe my safe deposit box at the bank will be confiscated.
You get the idea.
4. Gold is not convenient to actually use for daily transactions.  In fact I have NEVER traded gold for anything except Fiat.  And trading for fiat can be darn expensive with commissions and bid/ask spread.  And even more expensive if you are traveling. Try selling a shiny double Eagle in Singapore, you won't like the price.

I like our discussion, you reminded me that some of Bitcoin's usablity problems are because it is headless, decentralized.  There have been a series of centralized attempts like OS-Gold Egold, 1mdc E-Bullion.  They were more user friendly, but they tend to get their heads chopped off or run off with the money.  Some of Bitcoin learning curve and security problems are the burden users tolerate for having a P2P currency.
Hey, here is some encouraging news about storing wealth: insured Bitcoin deposits.
I hope this is the start of a trend.  Considering the fees Goxx was charging they sure as hell could have paid for full insurance on Bitcoin deposits.

There is a wave of new people that are a year away from that realization. It takes time, even with today's better info, videos, infrastructure. 
The joke used to be: price lags news 2 months, because if a new person decides Bitcoin is a great idea and wants to buy... on average it takes 2 months to work out the details and actually get some coins. 
Now people can buy the same day they read a big story.  But they have less understanding, less conviction, less vision?  They certainly have not figured out cold storage their first day. So more users  but a lower percent deciding to be holders.

Why should new people care about Open Transaction?
Maybe something like: 
Open Transaction is a way to stop Bitcoin from being Surveillance-Coin.  And it can route around  the coming efforts of Governments to break Bitcoin by breaking fungibility, and Goverments will try in a thousand seductive ways.

Maybe I misunderstood?  I though Greg Maxwell wrote that he is committed to decentralization, not committed to 1MB (higher might be better)
Do you feel mass adoption is worth the price of centralization, down to say 10 nodes, 2 nodes, how about 1 node.
I really don't know.  Is 100 nodes enough?
@_date: 2015-05-31 04:18:15


Yes, and the accuser, CypherDoc might have a conflict of interest: early adopter with a pile of Bitcoin, wants to see the price go up NOW, not after 5 years of slow growth.
So probably better to stick to the big question: how can we keep Bitcoin decentralized AND have scalability for mass adoption.
If we have sudden mass adoption (viral flood of porn watchers on Streamium?) can off-chain transactions handle it.
In fact, how big would the blocks be right now if ALL Bitcoin transactions were on the Blockchain.... all exchange buys and sells, all the high frequency trades on Chinese Exchanges...
@_date: 2015-05-31 05:32:54
Who should pay the $6.77 per transaction cost that is currently being subsidized by Bitcoin inflation?  (hint, that inflation is holding the price down, and price seems to correlate pretty well with adoption)
What do you think is a reasonable cost to send money anonymously to anybody anywhere with instant notification, and confirmation in about 10 minutes?  $1?  $.1?
Do Bitcoin users have an unassailable right to send subsidized transactions?  
Why isn't TCP/IP more user friendly?

Different labels might help some people get past mental stumbling blocks.  The word "pegged" has strong connotations for many people.  Another word or phrase might help people understand what is happening to the cryptographically locked Bitcoins without diverting their thoughts to **Pegged Currencies Are Bad** or **Pegged = Central Bankers**   
Seems like Blockstream can do more faster if people understand and are enthusiastic.

I like the idea of keeping Bitcoin lean and light and decentralized.
Let a thousand transaction consolidators like Coinbase spring up to handle scalability.
If you want to send Bitcoins directly, pay the miner fee, unsubsidized.  Currently  estimates that cost is about $6.77

Just 11 lines of code?  Easy to knock that out on a coffee break.   What are the developers doing all day, drinking beer and eating pizza.   Don't they care about Bitcoin?

Gavin seems to be having a run of bad luck: Foundation, BIPs, XT, Classic.  What did Gavin do at the Bitcoin Foundation, something about pruning and fund raising?
I am still curious, what is his job at MIT? Does he teach classes or have a schedule? For $200,000 don't they expect some measurable results? $200,000 would buy a lot of meals at Satoshi Forest.


Stability? Seems like Gavin is probing Bitcoin for political weakness. Is that is good, forcing Bitcoin to strengthen defenses before attacks from Governments &amp; banking groups?

Maybe because Satoshi realized that Gavin is a sell out.  
Gavin would happily sacrifice Bitcoin's Store of Value &amp; Privacy if he can have Paypal 2.0.  
He was content to let Bitcoin have the of the illusion of privacy, while being the opposite of privacy for the average user.  He had YEARS to make a few minor changes to lock down Bitcoin privacy.
Remember Gavin's excuse about not wanting to get paid in Bitcoins because it would be inconvenient for tax purposes.

@_date: 2016-05-09 06:35:16


It is a harsh question, but I think it has to be considered in the context of:
* Some of Gavin's BIPs were hostile takeover attempts.
* Gavin's XT was a hostile takeover attempt.
* Gavin's Klassic was a hostile takeover attempt.
Was Hoaxsatoshi another hostile takeover attempt?  Was Gavin trying to prop up a puppet Satoshi with help from his friend Jon Matonis.  (they started the Bitcoin Foundation, and collected about $1 million in paychecks)    
Gavin knows how to crypto-verify Satoshi from the comfort of home. So why do it the hard way?  Why the appeal to authority?    And now Gavin's silence &amp; misdirection enables the scammer to drag this out.  Gavin is encouraging uncertainty.  Why?
@_date: 2016-05-10 01:49:35
Seems to be a pattern with Gavin, perhaps a wolf in sheepskin with a talent for plausible deniability and publicity?
 * Gavin, only developer to give a Presentation for the CIA. Imagine Cody Wilson at the CIA, LOL!
  * Bitcoin foundation went broke, Gavin clueless? Fact: Gavin wanted paid in Fiat, not Bitcoins.
    * Mike Hearn wanted to be XT dictator with blacklists. Co-founder Gavin didn't know or care?
    * Mike Hearn takes the fall for Klassic, calls Bitcoin "failed experiment" And co-founder Gavin?
   * Mr CSW caught scamming in January, but fooled Chief Scientist &amp; friends in May. Really?
How much evidence about Gavin do we need to be concerned? Watch his behavior, not his words. If you dig into history and find I am wrong, please share. Do I owe Gavin an apology?
@_date: 2016-05-06 15:09:38


He was bamboozled to have a coffee date with the CIA?
bamboozled to start the Bitcoin Foundation (that imploded, what a mess)
Bamboozled to work with Mike Hearn, the Benign dictator, twice (XT &amp; Klassic)
And on, and on.  Does this stuff have to be repeated every time?  
Gavin is really good at playing Mr nice, and Mr innocent.  "I didn't know the bitcoin foundation was broke, I just collect a paycheck."  Really?  He started the Bitcoin foundation with Jon Matonis!
Enough.  Time for Gavin to take some responsibility.  No more blaming Mike Hearn, or the Foundation, or Craig Wrong.  Best thing Gavin could do right now, is take a vacation.  Somewhere without internet or phones, come back in 6 months.

I agree with you, Gavin certainly appears to be nice, he says nice things, never raises his voice, always polite.  "I'll sleep on it" is a nice way to say "Fuckoff, NEVER gonna happen"
What are the great things Gavin has done?  I would like to read your opinion.
He was a fairly good project manager.  He cleaned up some code.  All the info is not available.  I think some very kind-hearted developers are biting their tongue about Gavin.  I have tremendous respect for those developers.  They waited years for the rest of us to understand.
Is Gavin innocent, caught up in A Series of Unfortunate Events?
You can guess my opinion from a quick look at my recent posts. There is growing evidence that Gavin used his reputation to harm Bitcoin, again, and again.
It seems Gavin has done more harm than anyone since Mark Karples &amp; the MtGox disaster.   A lot of Gavin's behavior makes more sense if he had a big short position against BTC.  Hoaxsatoshi is just the latest.
In 2013 I was 100% on Gavin's side.  Perhaps I was naive.
Since then...well things changed.  Gavin makes lots of media appearances but doesn't write code.  Maybe the nicest way to say it... Gavin became more interested in Paychecks, Politics, and Publicity.

Just want everyone to be crystal clear about that, including people new to Bitcoin and looking for a leader.
Maybe the context is important.  This is the latest in a series of public Gavin blunders:  Bitcoin foundation, Bloom filters, XT, Klassic, hostile BIPs, the Hearn fiasco... and now Hoaxsatoshi.
Don't you wonder, just a little, how much trouble Gavin caused years ago when he was still coding.   Gavin pretends to be nice for politics.  The really nice people let him have a fancy title and gently escorted him from the building.  Someday the truth behind that might get out.   Some people have shown saint like tolerance for Gavin, for years.

Is "mistake" a euphemism for Epic-Career-Destroying-Blunder?
Way beyond a "mistake", this is like a locksmith who doesn't know how locks work.
When Gavin made an arithmetic error, and embarrassed himself in front of the whole crypto community, that was a big mistake.   What about Bitcoin foundation, Bloom filters, XT, Klassic, hostile BIPs, the Hearn fiasco... and now Hoaxsatoshi.
Gavin has been proudly calling himself "Chief Scientist" while accepting fiat salaries and speaking fees.
But when Gavin is asked to demonstrate his skills, when he has to do something more than talk....
An epic fail, international, public, in front of the media, and by his own choice... then he tries to bluff it out!
Is that what you mean by "mistake"?    Speak the simple truth: gross negligence, incompetence, no due diligence.

It is fun to pile on Roger's latest drama, a Casino positioned to grab Bitcoin newbies. 
But lets stick to the facts:
Roger paid to gave up his citizenship voluntarily.  If you know more, please share.
Roger has made some mistakes and put his foot in his mouth on technical issues.  Amusing but forgivable.  He is not a Bitcoin developer, or "chief scientist". It seems that Roger's technical misunderstanding and frustration led him sponsor attacks on Bitcoin.  This is more of a grey area.  I'm still assuming that Roger has good intentions, just misguided by some "experts".  
Roger had resources to buy Bitcoins early because he ran a profitable business.  He was an early investor in LOT of Bitcoin businesses and is still investing.  Respect.
He is a businessman and is frustrated by Bitcoin's slow adoption.  He is searching for ways to accelerate adoption.  Here is some 2012 news for perspective:  [Bitcoinstore](

Been waiting over 24 hours for a Bitcoins sent from Coinbase to show up in the Blockchain.   
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:25:42
Yes, and apply these words of wisdom in the stock market, but Bitcoin is not a stock.
Maybe study Bitcoin a little closer and realize what you really need is an "Emergency Fiat Exit Strategy".  Make sure you have at least two ways to exit Fiat and have tested them before the Fecal matter hits the whirling device.  
If you are confused have a chat with people in Cyprus.  
Similar drama is coming soon to a theater near you.   No waiting if you have funds in British Virgin Islands (huge privacy disaster) or Australia (just doubled the tax on retirement funds)
@_date: 2013-03-24 05:46:37
Forgotten?  Like the way Cyprus will be forgotten after locking up accounts for a week while deciding how much the surprise tax should be.
I won't forget. Bitcoin businesses especially are about Trust.  
Trust is completely broken after locking up my confirmed Bitcoins for **5 days**  I was patient and understanding for the first 24 hours.
Coinbase sure seems like nice hard working people, they offer a great new service at a very good price.  But I won't trust them or recommend them for more than tiny amounts for a long time.  They have had problems and delays with BTC to BTC transactions for months.   
It is really a pity because I consider Coinbase a Major factor in triggering the Rally that started around 13.   Their service is needed, but they are screaming "Hey, Coinlab, take all our customers please"

Let your feelings out, tell them how you really feel!
The price has returned to where it was 3 weeks ago.
You can blame it on MtGox if it makes you feel better.
If running a scalable bitcoin exchange is so easy, where is competition?
Other exchanges have had almost 2 years to since MtGox was hacked to grow and get ready.  
Why didn't most MtGox customers move as soon as the Lag became longer than say... one second?
I have not used MtGox for over a year, but I kinda admire them for putting up with the constant bitching.
Yes, I am puzzled that they didn't limit the bot traders when the Lag became excessive.  I am trying to think of a good reason why?

I buy Bitcoins when I can get a nice discount off the market price.  If the Bitcoin market was "efficient" then I would not be able to buy below the MtGox price including fees &amp; slippage, but I can. Perhaps I underestimate 3rd party risk, perhaps you overestimate market efficiency.

I deposited 30 Bitcoins on Coinbase last week thinking I *might* sell.  This week I tried to move them back to cold storage.  Transaction has been "pending" for 48 hours.
This is bad.  Delaying a Bitcoin to Bitcoin transaction for 48 hours is just...very bad.  I've had *great* experience with Coinbase buying and selling in the past, but can't recommend them for anything but tiny transactions until they get the bugs worked out.  Certainly I would not use them as a bitcoin wallet.
I emailed them twice and a received generic response.  That is ok, probably best if they focus all effort fixing the problem instead of handholding customers.  It does seem like they have a disturbingly serious problem.

Yes, I could use throwaway email accounts. But a VPN is supposed to be protecting my privacy, that is the core of what I pay them for.
So why are they even asking for my email, why don't they do their job from the start and set up their whole system to protect my privacy. I send Bitcoins, they send a Customer number.  Yes, it can be done.
They don't have to put a band aid on the problem by give users the burden of providing false info. What, are customer supposed use the wifi at the local coffee shop to get a Throwaway Email to sign up for a VPN?
The VPN's know a lot of the emails are Thowaways, so why are they asking, because they are lazy?  I prefer a VPN that makes the effort to collect LESS info.   There are some, but I have not found a really good one.

AND it seems Coinbase has lit a fire under MtGox's lazy ass.

Hope to see more posts from you.  Have you thought about comparing the top two ASIC manufacturers or the the two Bitcoin companies with the best chance of killing Western Union.

Seemls like everybody thinks their own morals are strong.  Crack whores selling their AIDS baby for a high will tell you they have strong morals.  
Nothing against Crack whores.

So... what do you think is a good deal on the Bitcoinstore?

If Faber is so smart, why didn't he recommend the  performing investment this year: Bitcoin

Yes, simple to transfer to Mtgox.

Only 6% to the all time high.
we might need a new subreddit:

Tesla's store is on Shopify, and Shopify accepts Bitcoin for any of their 70,000 merchants that request it.
Just need Tesla to request Bitcoin be enabled on their account.   One simple email request...

How are you holding up?
Are you feeling tested yet?   Are you buying more?
Sadly there is not enough room on the Bitcoin train for everybody.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:11:51


Hold that thought, you will be sorely tested.
Lots of people who think they are strong hands will find themselves selling long before Bitcoin hits $10,000
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:15:09
Yes, these are good guys, they really "get" bitcoin.  They didn't just slap bitcoin on their website to get customers.
I have ordered before, and will order again now

I would like to understand more about why you are short on labor.  I thought you might have too many volunteers, some those you help would want to return your kindness.
I am not in the USA so may there are labor laws that make volunteering illegal?  I dunno.
@_date: 2013-02-28 04:14:05


That would be GREAT.   I have fiat standing by.  Please sell your remaining Bitcoins to help the price crash.   After a few more crashes almost all Bitcoins will be safely locked away in cold storage by people who understand the extraordinary potential of Bitcoin.  Then you can buy back at much higher but more stable price.
If the lottery is a tax on people with poor math skills then Bitcoin is an Anti-tax on people with decent math skills.

Bitfloor is dead, long live Bitfloor.  I hope there is a way we can help it rise from the ashes.

I get excited when see bitcoin used well, RISEUP seems like a great example.  By comparison I spent hours looking for a VPN that accepts Bitcoin and does it right,  I looked at 37 of the VPNs listed in    I was not impressed with ANY of them.  I was  annoyed.
It seems like most slapped Bitcoin on their website just to drum up some business.
On the other hand, I am impressed with RISEUP, and I stumbled on them today by accident.  Yeah, I missed the tiny thread 5 months ago.  Do you think I should post in that thread?
Let's talk about the good stuff available for bitcoins.  I have coins, and I WANT to spend them.  
@_date: 2013-10-07 04:10:06
Perhaps you forgot that Bitcoin is open source.
Don't trust anybody, read the code for yourself.

Does it mean Snowden is an unappreciated Hero, who lit a fire under Yahoo and Google's ass, just for starters.  Nah, I'm sure they would have done the right thing... eventually.
Oh, I was ranting and starting to foam at the mouth, you were asking about Bitcoin:
Unless Gavin sold out to the FBI in 2011, nothing to worry about.
Bitcoin is about NOT needing to trust (banks, governments, coders...)
So I guess you could read the Bitcoin code for yourself:
Let us know if Gavin planted any subtle back doors.
Also this is fun discussion about the NSA and Bitcoin crypto:

Perhaps you are right, maybe I am ruining the signal/noise ratio here.  Or perhaps your efforts would be better spent on 9 new threads in 24 hours about the same China story.  I do appreciate your enthusiasm.
I am interested to read your suggestions about where to discuss the really good stuff available for bitcoins.  Or do you feel r/Bitcoin should be focused more on news?
I last year I knew every bitcoin related website, and read every message in r/Bitcoin.  This year... I can't keep up.
Would you care to share a favorite website that is doing bitcoin right?  Hey, is there a place that reviews say.. the 40 different Bitcoin VPN providers?
