In Russia, there was a similar situation in 2008, when banks refused to exchange rubles for dollars, due to currency fluctuations.

Looks even more nice than 78.12%  
Though, no.

Did you really thought it would be easy? C'mon, man, if you already started it don't give up too soon.
You know you're right, don't you? So what is worst: to feel yourself annoying or to throw your goals and ideas because you want to feel comfortable like  ̶n̶o̶r̶m̶a̶l̶ ̶old-fashioned stick-to-holy-usd person?
Why are you in this subreddit anyways if you're going to do only easy steps?
If even 1 of 100 merchants in a week start accept BTC because of you - then it would be 1.1m merchants in a week if anyone from this subreddit would do the same.
Sometimes you should just stop if you don't see results.
But sometimes you need to recall that there won't be any results if everyone stop. Never. Someone need to start and keep going. There is nothing better to do in life than to do what do you think is right. Satoshi must've knew that and he probably believed that he isn't alone.

Yeah, it did too fast from 3 to 13.
But didn't it went down too fast from 20 to 6 in 2018?

That's really incredible. Gold or Petroleum price chart can't even compete with this.
@_date: 2019-08-26 04:08:11
The truth is, nobody knows for sure about future price. Too many factors involved.
@_date: 2019-08-26 04:23:47
Sweetest noise ever.
@_date: 2019-08-26 03:31:12
7) is false
BTC better than Gold, since can be easily transfered from one person to another and can be divided into small parts.
@_date: 2019-08-26 04:44:24
This flat can't be forever, sooner or later price gonna change.
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:00:36
Who really cares? Maybe real Satoshi already died, does anybody thought about it?
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:48:20
What will happen if world will find out who Satoshi is? Anything will change? Nothing!
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:53:00
 Even if someone reveals your identity, he/she still won't know of how much BTC do you have, so. It may be a really paranoic matter. There is a lot of rich people who we definitely know about they're rich - and most of them don't get bothered about it.

The difference between buy and sell would become smaller as more of BTC ATM become available all over the world. For now it's absolutely explainable.
@_date: 2019-09-23 23:23:19
Will be a good meme in the future.
@_date: 2019-09-10 21:30:31
What about accepting BTC as a salary or wages? BTC is absolutely not just investment, it's way more actually.
@_date: 2019-09-05 02:50:49
Who would've thought...
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:47:45
He just considered it'd be more profitable than painting fiat dollars.
@_date: 2019-09-05 02:40:30
Yeah, like is struggle anyways.
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:44:03
I recommend software wallet, where you have more control, imao
For BTC, for example, [ has application for Android
