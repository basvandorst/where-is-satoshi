Banks are there to make a profit. That’s how they can give you money back once stolen. There goes 
I’m pretty sure criminals use cash too, like every day. At all levels. There goes 
Give me your name and your city and for $5 I can get pretty much any information I want regarding your finances. Unless your hiding your money like a criminal. There goes

This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images.  
The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print. 
Be careful, friends!

Bitcoin has struggled to recover from last week’s wild swings, with the price of the popular but volatile digital currency giving up some of its weekend recovery to trade at about $14,000 by midday on Sunday in New York. 
The cryptocurrency tumbled more than 30 per cent for its biggest reverse of the year before a similarly steep rally on Friday, with the frenzied trading bringing a major cryptocurrency exchange to a standstill as investors reacted to warnings from global regulators and concerns about security in the nascent market.
Bitcoin reached a peak of $19,666 on December 17, but collapsed as much as 31.8 per cent on Friday to a low of $10,775 per coin. It clawed back some of its losses on Friday morning and Saturday to reach above $16,000 again, before slipping back just below the $14,000 mark on Sunday.
Michael Novogratz, a prominent former hedge fund manager and one of bitcoin’s most ardent champions in the traditional finance industry, on Friday shelved plans to launch a cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund, and warned that bitcoin could slide to as low as $8,000. He has previously predicted it could hit $50,000 by the end of next year. 
“Looks to me like a short term top is in,” Mr Novogratz wrote on Twitter on Friday “Bull market isn’t over. Just pausing.”
“To be clear, we delayed launching a hedge fund with outside investors capital last week because we didn’t like market conditions for new investors. In no way does it mean we are less bullish the crypto markets,” he added. 
The explosion of interest in bitcoin and its cryptocurrency cousins has been labelled by many analysts as a classic speculative mania, and drawn warnings from regulators across the world that investors should be wary of the dangers posed by the volatile world of digital currencies. 
Those worries were sharpened last week when a small US-listed soft-drink maker called Long Island Iced Tea Corp surged as much as 500 per cent after changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp, a spike that echoed the peak of the dotcom mania.
Underscoring its status as the wildest frontier of finance, the turbulence of bitcoin has for the past month been greater than the volatility suffered by US equities at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008, the Black Monday crash of 1987 and the Black Tuesday slide of 1929 that heralded the Great Depression.

Not everyone has their money in cash. It might be in a retirement account and they can only purchase etfs listed on the market. This opens bitcoin to a group that previously didn’t have a route to purchasing it.

Second worst in 22 years. There have been other mass shootings in that 22 years. There’s a page of them on Wikipedia.
