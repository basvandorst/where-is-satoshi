I suppose I have a looser definition of circuit breaker than you do.  Advanced electronic circuit breakers in the industrial world can trip based on quite a variety of criteria, and a surprising range of subtlety designed to catch and avoid problems.
If drop/rise in price is the only criteria for trip, then this doesn't qualify.  Lack of liquidity is another potential reason to trip, and I'm sure if I was designing Coinbase software, I'd find a few others. ;)

It is worth the read, if fo no other reason than the sex in translation.  Ok, perhaps I should grow up, but that hasn't taken effect by now, I may as well give up.
But I must disagree.  Everything is not fine.  I have to go to work in the morning.  Oh shit, that would be now!

Arbitrage; do it well, you get rich.  Do it poorly...
And there are those who like screwing others over.  Do it well...

Yes.  We just did't know when that ride would end.  The next bus, however...

And the sex?  Oh, we wezterners!
Yeah, looked bullish to me as well, even in translation.

Not rss, but bitcoin paranoid.  Be advised, it can be annoying. :)

From the nature point of view...

Well said.
