I didn't violate their terms, but either way they have the right to close my account if they so choose. My issue is with them not allowing me to withdraw.

Very nice! I'm glad that worked out for you.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:54:26
Yes, it's unlikely they'd keep the loan for 10 days.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:48:06
The problem is that the borrower can repay at any time, even seconds after the fork. So your 35% potential profit isn't guaranteed.

You mean it was all FUD? No way!

They aren't supporting BCC. Take your BTC off Polo ASAP!

This is the theory that makes the most sense to me. Bad actors were spamming the network but stopped once they realized that their actions were actually improving the chance of Segwit activation.

Not necessarily illegal, just against their TOS. Exchanges that deal with USD are strictly regulated and Coinbase needs to comply or possibly be shut down. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:59:44
So if I have BTC on Polo, not loaned out, will they credit me with BCC or are they keeping it for themselves?
@_date: 2017-07-06 02:44:59
No because you will still need to provide ID, address, bank info, etc.

What are the most liquid and trustworthy exchanges to dump BCC on August 1? So far it seems like Bittrex is the best option? Any other exchanges I should be exploring?
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:43:03
Any news on Poloniex policy regarding how they will handle BCC?
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:22:37
I'm sure there is more to this story. Why did they close your account? If you violated their TOS they have every right to close your account. You haven't even given them a chance to respond and here you are spreading FUD on the forums. If you are going to post about it then let's hear the actual details.

Have you actually tried to send a btc transaction lately? I sent one today with fees of .03sat/byte and got confirmed in 2 hours.

We're no way near a bubble, not long-term anyway. Of course there will be price corrections along the way but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The bubble talk is nonsense. What % of the population has actually ever owned a bitcoin? This is nothing like the dotcom bubble where every single person I knew was "investing" in tech stocks and crushing it.

The next financial reset will likely cause an epic bubble in Bitcoin.
Thanks to the monetary policies of Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, in the US there are concurrent bubbles in all of the traditional asset classes (stocks, real estate, and bonds) . The artificially low interest rates due to central planning have resulted in a gross misallocation of capital. A reset is inevitable and in my opinion, desirable. When those bubbles burst and the money flees those assets, where will the money go?
Initially the money will flow into the traditional safe havens - mostly $USD and some gold. Some money will also go into bitcoin at this time, as hedge fund managers and other financial “experts” are already extolling the virtues of bitcoin as a safe haven.
As the crash of traditional financial assets intensifies, the central banks will respond by doing the only thing they know how to do - print more money. This will prompt investors to flee $USD as well. Where will all that money go?
Real estate? No, its crashing.
Stocks? No, they’re getting obliterated.
Bonds? Possibly to front-run the Fed, but yields are so low already there isn’t much upside.
Gold? Definitely! Gold is real money - money that government can’t just print an infinite amount of like they can with fiat money.
Bitcoin? Now we’re talking.
Bitcoin is real money and there is a finite supply which allows it to naturally gain value vs fiat currencies as they inflate their money supply. Bitcoin is a store of value like gold, but has far more utility.
Bitcoin has a reputation for being a volatile and risky investment, but investors will have seen their “safe” investments obliterated while Bitcoin is continuously making new highs. At this point, Bitcoin will seem like a relatively safe investment. In fact, as the rotation from traditional assets into Bitcoin intensifies, Bitcoin will likely be touted by the mainstream media and financial press as the safest investment, and the best way to protect against the financial downturn.
As the financial downturn progresses, some countries will experience currency crises and may be forced to adopt Bitcoin as their official currency. If that happens, central banks will also start buying bitcoins as part of their reserve. Sovereign wealth funds may also start buying bitcoins as part of their asset allocation. Once governments start to embrace and legitimize bitcoin, the masses will rush to get in and cause the price to skyrocket.
So how high can Bitcoin go?
This is impossible to predict, but I’ll give my thoughts on how high it could potentially go. Markets tend to overshoot, and I expect Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to become wildly overvalued before the cyclical bull market ends. At the peak of the upcoming cryptocurrency bubble its valuation could reach or exceed that of gold. The total value of all gold ever mined is worth about $7 trillion. If we make an assumption that Bitcoin will make up approximately 25% of cryptocurrency market cap, we get an estimated value of over $100,000 per bitcoin.

I agree with you that shitcoins are in a massive bubble. My post was referring specifically to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has major issues right now, but they will eventually be resolved it will be worth far more in the long run. It might be a bubble in the sense that Amazon's price temporarily overshot its value in 1999, but I think anyone that continued to HODL is pretty happy.

Vinny has publicly been a staunch supporter of Bitcoin over Ethereum. Honestly I think he's just trying to remain consistent. If/when RSK is actually ready I doubt Civic will actually make the switch unless it's clearly going to be orders of magnitude better (which it probably won't).
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:54:59
Vinny said that it's going to be ERC-20 token to start and once RSK is ready they plan on moving to RSK.

It's even easier to just write a white paper, ICO, and instantly cash out millions.
