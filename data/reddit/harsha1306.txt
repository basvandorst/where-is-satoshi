Hmm this is interesting. I fall under the NRI category so don't have to worry about it for the short term but I need to keep tabs on this nonetheless.

It's the right time to HODL. 
It's always time to HODL though.

Well I get contacted by some recruiters on there many of them don't pan out into actual interviews. I don't have much experience (started working full time only a year ago) so i don't get noticed by too many recruiters. Infact my profile only gained traction after I completed 1 full year of work experience. 
They also offer a premium subscription which I think is kind of a scam because a recruiter can still choose to hide their information when they're viewing your profile. The only thing of value that I gained with linkedin premium is adding in certificates from the courses you can complete there. 
Applying to jobs on there is pointless. I can say that 99% of the jobs I've applied there by myself never pan out and another thing is that most of the job roles posted there force you to again register on another website that the company uses.

LinkedIn premium learning has some intro to bitcoin and blockchain courses. I'll finish them and watch my profile views and connection requests skyrocket XD

Yeah makes sense I guess. When you take the impact of the banking industry as a whole it does favor BTC more.

What about the energy argument? The fact that it takes so much energy to operate the network is concerning.
