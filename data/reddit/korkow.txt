But his friend doesn't have to wait for the transfer to clear before he withdraws money from the ATM, on the faith that the online wire will clear eventually. Unless the friend is dead broke, in which case your point would be valid.

Why? I mean, I'm all for Bitcoin, and own quite a bit. But I feel like this situation would've been much simpler if he had just gotten a friend to withdraw cash from an ATM. Then OP wouldn't be limited to only spending money in bitcoin-accepting locations.

How quickly should it show up in your balance? I go to a very large university (~40,000 students), and I signed up with that email but my balance is still 0.

I'd have to quadruple check I typed it correctly before sending, and even then I'd still be scared it went to the wrong place.

Yeah, except one of them is log scale and the other is linear. EXTREMELY misleading

He's not trying to mine coins. It's probably set up purely for the sake of adding a node to improve the network.

Aaaaaaand it's gone.

The absurdly long withdrawal times made me switch out.
@_date: 2012-08-04 04:36:57
Why not just save it in Bitcoins for a while longer? The mining difficulty is going to be increasing pretty significantly in a couple weeks, so the price is probably just going to go up even higher.
@_date: 2012-08-12 07:09:54
Aaand it's already broken.

I think you might be misunderstanding the definition of "impossible".
@_date: 2013-06-03 16:35:30
Well duh you can make a new one, but that doesn't stop someone from withdrawing any money you have in there.
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:56:52
That's it? If you were a rich mastermind all you would want is two chicks at the same time?

Except that USD is waaaaay more relevant and useful than BTC, for the time being. I can't pay my rent or buy groceries with bitcoins.

As someone who lost 26 BTC in the Bitfloor theft back in September, I applaud Graet for doing the right thing. Damn you, Roman!

What if I'm day-trading regularly? If I were to keep my BTC funds in my private wallet, I would be unable to react to the changing market quickly, and would constantly have to pay the transfer fee.
I'm using CampBX, which at least *seems* to boast good security.

I'm not gonna have web access on my phone anytime soon. For now I'm part of a *bitchin'*, old, grandfathered family plan that's $15/month for the first phone + $5/month per additional line, with LOTS of minutes, and unlimited SMS. You simply cannot get deals even CLOSE to that anymore, and my family is lucky as fuck to have signed up for it when we did (like, 8 years ago). 
Paying $40 a month for 6 phones lines is just too good to give up.

RIP in peace, OP's grammar.
@_date: 2013-05-30 02:05:09
Yup, completely spot on. I need to subscribe to this guy's articles...

Coinapult seems like the best answer I've gotten so far. I'll definitely look in to using this.
@_date: 2013-06-02 06:47:12
Oooh, I never knew about that! For $50, I'd definitely consider getting something like that...
@_date: 2013-06-02 00:55:55
I definitely am not willing to drop $200 on something like that when I already own a working phone (just a cheap flip phone), an mp3 player that I'm happy with, and very little spare cash.

Well, with a debit/credit card, there are precautions in place to reduce the risk of theft. If my CC info is stolen, I can call my bank, have them cancel it, and most likely get my money returned.
If someone steals my BTC wallet info, I'm shit outta luck.
