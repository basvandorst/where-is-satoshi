the coins did not disappear: they are on the blockchain on identified adresses. The problem is that no one knows who owns these adresses.

Attacking a password is very costly (and incertain). So why would a hacker would do that if you have say 10btc on your adress?
But i agree, even if you trust them when they say they don't keep the adress and encrypted keys on their server, they can be attacked, so this is not a "true" cold storage.

totally irrelevant... are you a self-bashing french???
 
- it's not only a electronic money but also a disruptive technology like the internet was (or maybe take the e-mail as a comparison).
- France cannot miss the innovation possibilities underlying this technology. See other countries: US, Germany, Great Britain (very effective to say that Great Britain is on the point to take the bitcoin-train: as random-retarded-french-people they hates Brits, it's well known). Because they are local elected people, you should point that a lot of startup could grow in France. If they don't grow in France they will in another more friendly country.
- DON'T insist on the fact that the electronic money could compete with their loved-euro.
- etc ... 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:58:10
sad but true :/ however, the community only needs the raise of a few opinion leaders (like Marc) to explain that bitcoin is an extremely promising innovation source. So a lot of people will start to consider it seriously even if they don't understand it (it's not a problem: e.g only few people understand how a phone or a mastercard works, however they use it)

did you try to run it on one pc alone with parallelized cores and to compare perfo? The pcs are linked with ethernet?
For your point 1: 
- it's impossible to know if an address has been generated as a brainwallet or not.
- Even the very weak password of OP is very difficult to bruteforce.
for these reasons, if some retarded people try to use you code to bruteforce some Btc address, the only cost will be on their electricity bill \^_^

I wasn't talking about scarcity but about the credibility of the protocol: if the coins are lost (i.e. Mark lost the private keys), it's way better than if they were stolen (i.e. possibility to make an exploit in the protocol).
And insulting people will not get your coins back.

many people sold when the MtGox joke begun because they expected bad news to drop the price down.

Sure, but in this case the hacker would have publicly claimed his exploit before all the system being on the point to be fucked. If he didn't it's probably he doesn't want to return back the coins. When people makes hacks for glory, they boat about it no? If they don't it's because their priority is theft not hack.

I totally agree with you on "virtual", maybe less on "electronic".
It is important to find an adjective that describe the main property of bitcoin as a currency and points the difference with classical currencies in the same time. 
"Decentralised" could be a good candidate (it points on the fact that the FED or other central bank cannot manipulate it) but maybe other one could be convenient too.

sure so the behavior of business has the same effect than random people's one: if they sell to fiat, they tend to decrease the price, and if they doesn't, the price stands (and if they buy they tend to increase the price). I think OP's problem is a false problem.

Voting maintains the illusion of democracy. On my part, I admitted that democracy has failed in our countries.
Did you ever seen a talented but random people (i.e. who doesn't have million of dollars from lobbying funds or rich friends for his campaign) be elected? NO! and why? Because the ones who have the money for their campaign are the ones chosen not by you but by the oligarchy for you.

Strange: 
You need a big investment to mine some fraction of btc per day. 
The value of btc being low, the ROI must be low too. 
The only thing that make sense is to mine btc for the day they will have dramatically increased in value. But if you participate in something that is a huge threat to the protocol, you increase dramatically the risk that never happen. IT IS a long term thought.

Hey, do you have a site where one can enter a publi/private key and to obtain a nice looking stuff to print? 
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:10:55
no that's not just "it's gone", that's "it has been stolen". Maybe you are confortable with your loss, but i bet the large majority of gox users isn't.

Yes the timing coincide with a lot of things, BUT withdrawal problem begun last year, not on Feb: and this is a very bad for the credibility of the statement. They don't explain what was the problem before Feb.

you have my sympathy, you have been stolen, it's different of playing on a market and losing everything because you suck at trading.
