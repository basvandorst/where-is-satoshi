it might be relevant, it might not. but my gut is to not buy into any "big selloff" hype because there is no reason someone who was actually planning on making a market moving sale would actually publicly tip people off about it ahead of time. if people start buying into something like that then it's going to lower the price and the person making the big sell won't have as much profit. 
then again, people aren't always the rational, selfish monkeys that economists like to believe they are

I came here to say this.
I recently planned a backpacking trip in Asia. Many of the hostels and guesthouses had sketchy looking websites. When they required payment upfront, I would be happy if it was paypal. If they were to ask for Bitcoin, I would not be likely to book a place ahead of time

as best I can tell, he's predicting that someone will sell off a lot of BTC on Sunday when trading isn't as active and believes that it will destroy market confidence for the short future. this is based on his claims of two instances of a large sell occurring on Sunday in the previous weeks.
for what it's worth, I don't even understand where his signal is coming from, as none of the largest drops in the past month have occurred on a Sunday ([Bitcoin Charts]( My guess is that he's trying to encourage people to panic sell so that he can buy in at a lower price. And as someone who has a negligible amount of BTC now but is looking to get in within the next few months, I wish him luck in trying to lower the price (*just kidding.* sorta. )
