Thank you so much for the detailed description I understand more now!

I am new to BTC.  I have $10 worth in Coinbase (not much I know just playing around).  I got an email about the fork but have no clue about what that means or what I should do.  The information I am reading is overwhelming.  Can anybody simplify/explain what I should do?  Whether that is to do nothing or something else.

So when a fork happens you get BTC and then something mimicking it until it is swayed as to which one is the real BTC? I may be way off.

So since I don't really care about the split should I buy more when the price falls? Since I know it will go back up?

 I think I get what you are saying thank you!

You're welcome! I don't know, these guys were saying 8K by December woul not be weird. It was 3k just earlier this year. That would be cool. But I am just playing around with it and not putting in any more money than I'm prepared to lose if a bubble occurs or something else.

Ok thank you I will check it out!

Ok, talked to some people on a BTC discord. So, before the fork if it goes down to about 6700-6500 it would probably be a good time to buy.  After the fork it will drop and then when it stops and starts to go back up it is a good time to buy since the "real BTC" will start getting support.

As far as I understand it I don't know if it happens that way. I think if you just buy like normal you are fine.  People know how to sell the 2X and make a little extra cash but I think if the price drops you can buy like normal. That's what I'm going to do. Or before if it keeps going down like it is.

Do I need to move it around or just wait for it to recover? I am still confused as to what the hell Bitcoin2x is lol

Waiting to do what after the fork? I'm new to this but supposedly after the 16th, when the fork is supposed to happen, the price will drop then over time will recover and is projected to go higher than it is now.

Obviously it is projected to go up.  How much is unclear.  Since there is only a fixed number of BTC someday it will all be mined and then, I think, the price with drop/cap. I read somewhere that it is projected to go up to like $300,000/1 BTC by like 2025 or something. But just as much as you can't predict your own future, you can't with BTC, stocks, etc. Obviously we have a good idea what will happen, but it is never a garuntee.
