 hire someone that can help you batch transactions. You're still clogging the network for no reason and passing the tx fee onto your customers.

"fully compatible with bitcoin transactions from SegWit wallets."
You need to **send** bitcoin using segwit in order to benefit from the increased block size and lower fees. 
You can send a segwit tx or make a segwit output **to any non segwit bitcoin address without any distinction of the receiving party supporting segwit or not.** The payor will still receive the 75 percent fee discount. The receiving party doesn't need to support it 
Bitpay couldn't have worded that more ignorantly if they tried..  With that said they probably do allow you to **send** bitcoin using segwit, if they don't support **sending** bitcoin using segwit, there is no improvement.

I didn't think I could dislike a person or a company more then I dislike RogerVer until I realized none of coinbase's transactions are batched.
 you're a total ass hole. You know what you're doing to the network and you don't care, it took a network outage at coinbase to let the public know how ignorantly coinbase handles transactions. It took public awareness and backlash for you to admit *YOU ARE SPAMMING the bitcoin network*. You deserve a special place in hell.

What's Coinbase got to say about schnorr considering they wont use it because they won't/refuse to batch their  transactions? As a result they're single handedly clogging bitcoin while passing on the consequences of their ignorance/bad intentions in the form of high transaction fees for everyone.
Brian Armstrong said on Bloomberg that segwit was not one of the top 5 requested "things" from coinbase users. How about asking your users if you want Coinbase to do simple batching? **Include in the poll that batching will result in them paying much lower transaction fees..**   tell us the results of that poll on Bloomberg.

Im shocked it lists bitcoin.com as a website "for" bitcoin considering its a for profit business that is pushing an altcoin. They intend to sell bitcoin cash directly on their website, they have or intend to have a bitcoin cash "debt" card. If you're going to start listing for profit businesses then just list "coinbase.com" on there too.
and remember what Satoshi said about bitcoin.com NOT being official or related to bitcoin

Agreed there is no excuse for this level of incompetence. It's hard to believe it's out of pure ignorance, I fail to understand how it's possible to be that ignorant. It is spam because they could easily start batching if they wanted to, they know how much spam they're introducing. 
I'm more likely to believe they're doing this to make it harder or less convenient to withdraw and/or the CEO is so pro bcash and eth that he wants bitcoin to drown in spam. 
If it's just pure ignorance then I'd say sure it's not spam but no one is that dumb, it is spam.

1) When USD gets inflated then 1 USD is worth less relative to other currencies.
2) When USDT gets inflated it's not worth less relative to other currencies? 
Of course it is.
What's great about bitcoin is that it's not fractional reserve and can't be printed for free. Even if I lie about how I bought my bitcoin (by telling someone my gold colored napkin is worth 1 btc) I still own 1 bitcoin that someone else had to obtain at market rate. It doesn't matter who owns it or even if whoever owned it obtained it by stealing. There's not a magic trick to getting more bitcoin, more bitcoin is more bitcoin(can't be inflated beyond mining)
If USDT(can be printed, inflated at whim) prints more USDT and introduces more inflation then the value has to drop against other currencies. Other currencies inflating makes bitcoin more valuable, not less valuable.
If this were possible then what stops me from creating at centralized altcoin where I can print as much as I want for free and worth 1 dollar to all other crypto's as well?

They're still going to "support" bcash, about 28 days left to do so according to their own word. Not sure if that's to enable trading or just a split/sell/withdraw function for bcash because they haven't provided any detail.
if coinbase goes the direction of supporting bcash, they're going to have to give everyone their "bgold/bitcoin gold" also, and every future fork. Even if the next one is called "Bitcoin Blockchain".  Exchanges should not have allowed such a confusing name to exist(Bitcoin cash), it's retarded but the exchanges have fees to gain from division and branding confusion. Someone needs to create a fork called "bitcoin-blockchain" and force coinbase to "support" that as well to give them a hint, you cannot support a chain that tries to confuse new users.

Either you don't split or "support" forked chains or you do, once you've done it for bcash you have to do it for future forks as well.
This is possibly a legal precedent they've made for themselves. They're much more likely to be sued for not supporting future forks after they support bcash.  
Coinbase Customers: "You gave me my bcash, thanks for fulfilling your fiduciary duty.. wheres my bgold? now where's my bitcoin-blockchain?"
The day Coinbase supports a chain that is intent on stealing the bitcoin brand like "bcash" is trying to do, is the day Coinbase shouldn't object to other more friendly forks, forks that dont use the same address format, forks that don't try to rename bitcoin to bitcoin-core, forks without confusing names. Coinbase isn't just "supporting" a fork, it's supporting a hostile fork, supporting fraud, with that it would be unreasonable if they refused to support anything else other then "bcash"

This is correct and I'd like to add that you can buy a starbucks card with bitcoin today *(using gyft, egifter, cardforcoin, etc)* Register your card with the starbucks app, then go into the store and use your starbucks app to buy the coffee. This would be doing exactly the same thing, **Starbucks accepting fiat for coffee.**
For that matter you can just use a bitcoin prepaid/debt card and use that at a starbucks, this is also the same thing. Starbucks is getting fiat/dollars/euros, not crypto currency.
When you use Bitrefill to reload your Verizon or tmobile phone using your bitcoin funds, is Verizon accepting bitcoin? **No.** Verizon does not hold any bitcoin or accept any bitcoin. This is the same situation with Starbucks.

it should be called BCash, its just logical.
It's two words "bitcoin cash" which is too long.. or "BCH" which isn't a name, it's an acronym, an acronym that sounds/looks like "bitch".
BCash is the most logical thing to call it. Roger ver getting "upset" about people calling it Bcash is stupid. It's the most obvious name and the easiest.  
After Ethereum Classic gets listed by coinbase and more people refer to it, they're not literally going to say "Ethereum Classic" all the time because it's too long of a name. It will probably be reduced to "EthClassic"

Starbuck's own words:
According to Starbucks spokespeople, however, this is not the case. Starbucks doesn’t want bitcoins, but it’s willing to help people spend them—the venture is an exchange that will allow people to convert their cryptocurrency into US dollars, which they can then spend at Starbucks locations. Starbucks’ role in the partnership as the flagship retailer is to consult and develop applications for this purpose.
*“It is important to clarify that we are not accepting digital assets at Starbucks. Rather the exchange will convert digital assets like Bitcoin into US dollars, which can be used at Starbucks,” a Starbucks spokesperson wrote me in an email. “At the current time, we are announcing the launch of trading and conversion of Bitcoin. However, we will continue to talk with customers and regulators as the space evolves.”*
*“Customers will not be able to pay for Frappuccinos with bitcoin,”* the spokesperson wrote.
You can actually spend your bitcoin at CoffeeBean, DildoExpress, Starbucks, and any store if you just used a Bitcoin debit card.

No the father son case also included drugs: "Michael Lord also pleaded guilty to one count of agreeing to distribute Schedule IV controlled drug and anti-anxiety medication alprazolam"
So far drugs have been involved in every single case.
We also shouldn't scare people from using cash. Paying for things in cash is not illegal. Payments over 10,000 dollars in cash are supposed to be reported to the IRS and still you're not breaking any laws if you don't do so because you didn't know you were supposed to and/or did not show intent to circumvent. 
Even so people all day long use Craiglist and Ebay meet in person and exchange "large" amounts of cash. Nothing wrong with that. **Bitcoin is considered property in the united states, just like everything else you can buy on Craigslist.** A lot of older people I know didn't get bank loans to buy their homes and they paid for them all in cash, literal cash with no questions asked. Lets not imply or convince people that it is illegal, or it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy as less and less people use cash.

That's all it is and you can already do that today using egifter, gyft, cardforcoin, and any bitcoin-debit card.
You don't need a extra complicated way to sell your Bitcoin for US dollars just to spend those dollars only at starbucks.
If I'm going to sell Bitcoin for US dollars I can buy coffee, this is true as much as I can buy anything that accepts dollars. 
It would be a lot easier to use a bitcoin debit card and you can shop anywhere, not just starbucks. If I use a bitcoin debit card at a gas station does the gas station accept bitcoin? No. We don't say that and no one should be saying starbucks will accept bitcoin.

"The 435 Megawatt" as the article says is just the theoretical maximum amount of power they think they have to the building (an empty building). In my opinion 435 megawatts is likely WAY over blown, what they did to get that number was say "considering we have unlimited power capacity to this location, how many miners could we house in the footprint of the entire property?" then maybe you get come up with a 435 megawatt figure 
There is no statement on how many miners or how much power they'll actually use.

When you have one miner making all the mining hardware (Jihan), you have a few miners on the periphery that would cease to exist if they didn't kiss Jihan's ass.

Someone that hacks a frozen account probably wouldn't get far in a KYC/AML'ed relationship. All they have to do to verify that it is the owner is to ask for a new photo holding his ID, and maybe a paper with the ticket number written on it. 
Bittrex can also send a postal note to the address he used for verification.
It doesn't appear like he's trying to hide, but I'll ask him

He's willing to give 10% if someone can help fix his problem. So what? If he believes his money is really locked up with no hope in sight, then paying people to help doesn't mean anything. If I had a bunch of money tied up in altcoins (looks like he only owns alts) I'd want it out of bittrex ASAP because altcoins are more volatile  
 


When you buy an altcoin with bitcoin on the exchange, it's usually a round number.. That's not unusual at all. Considering everything he owns is an altcoin, this is normal.  


 
Just because someone is not sure how to split their bitcoin cash safely and is asking for advice does not make them a scammer.  


I can't understand what your 4th point is so I'll ignore it.


5th point?: So what if he's a redditor for 5 months and says he has 120K US dollars. That means nothing. Plenty of people have more then 120K US dollars and don't have reddit accounts.
**Everything you said really means nothing. It's all circumstantial.** 
Maybe he is a scammer, I don't know. What I can tell you is your long rant of so called evidence is just mumbo jumbo.

We're referring to the two chains as ABC and SV
A empty block mined with SV consensus rules is compatible with ABC-consensus rules. Craig intends to mine empty blocks on the abc chain if abc "wins", which he could do while supporting SV rules with the same miners and same software
"It could also work for not empty blocks if they ensure no dependent transaction are included within the same block. Then CTOR is an instance of TTOR."
fyi, no replay protection either. At exact time of this post submission the SV rules are supported by 73% of the hash rate. Which is why the desperate attempt by Roger Ver to force bitcoin miners to support Abc
    bch roger ver jihan wu abc drama starts below this line
P.S. while Roger Ver is **Forcing** unsuspecting bitcoin miners to support BCH-ABC, May I suggest *voluntarily* putting a little bit of mining power to oppose ABC, stick it to Jihan and Roger, and mine on SVpool.com during the abc sv fork which takes place 17 hours from now.   *because sometimes: an enemy of my enemy is my friend*
Even at 73% support SV needs more help as it may find itself less then 50% just minutes leading upto the fork as someone (Jihan) from their bitcoin pools, **Forces** more unsuspecting bitcoin miners to support Abc.

The fee is 31 cents but whatever, it all depends on how many inputs and outputs, if you're sending that transaction with segwit or not. If you would have sent 127 BTC with just 2 inputs and 2 outputs the fee would have only been 11 cents or less.
In either case that tx paid just 2.2 sat per byte, which is really low.
One thing that is annoying is that all the online bitcoin fee estimation websites do not tell you what the fee would be if you used segwit. 
Example  tells you what the recommend fee is WITHOUT segwit only. A segwit tx would be a third to a half the fee cost. A transaction with a lot of inputs WITH segwit could easily be half the fee cost in comparison to sending the same transaction without segwit. So if estimatefee.com's website had a check box "sending with segwit" and adjust the recommended fee accordingly, it would add a lot of awareness to segwit to every day users.

Of course segwit is good but they're also trying to mask the fact that all other large exchanges do batching but them. Masking their negligence in the ecosystem by ignoring batching and talking about segwit. Batching is very easy.

If someone is actually concerned about the fees they pay they have a way to fix that themselves by using segwit.

*"When sending Bitcoin from Coinbase to an external address, we will automatically send your transaction using SegWit. Because SegWit is backwards compatible with previous Bitcoin addresses"*

"BitcoinABC" (bitcoinABC.org) is one of bcash's implementations/wallets. Just as 'core' is just a single implementation/wallet. Does that mean they're(RogerVer)  going to call bcash "bitcoin ABC" ? 
Because if Roger is going to try renaming bitcoin into bitcoin core then he's got to rename bcash into "Bitcoin ABC". Which would be illogical. You do not name your coin after one implementation.
RogerVer&amp;bcash users might be able to lie to and confuse the new bitcoin users, but eventually the newbie's will become educated in the space and will no longer be newbie's, they'll realize they've been lied to. IMO: it's a short term/short lived scam they're pulling.

I don't think thats the case. The very slight uptick we seen in the segwit charts could just be people running bitcoin 0.16, not coinbase. I don't think coinbase has even started making segwit outputs yet.
One or more coinbase hot wallet should be a segwit address. When a user receives bitcoin at their coinbase account it doesn't matter if they used a segwit address, a bitcoin output will use the same wallet for multiple users. Like all exchanges they don't literally have a wallet for each user but rather a handful of hot wallets. A plain SQL database says how much bitcoin belongs to which user.

the "Lite" in Litecoin is meant to be lower security per confirmation/per the block, 2.5 minutes opposed to bitcoin's 10 minute block time. The faster your block time is the less secure your first confirmation is. It's 2.5 minute block time also provides four times the transaction capacity of bitcoin.  "Lite" or lightweight version of bitcoin means less security but faster confirmation. 


It has nothing to do with using less electricity and obviously you don't understand how mining works.


You can't stop a hashing algorithm from being parallelized. 
What you meant to express was that it was supposed to be ASIC resistant. Given enough age and financial incentive a ASIC will be produced because there's no such thing as "ASIC proof". It's not because of a "mistake" the author made. Given enough of a financial motive and time, someone will make an ASIC. There's talk of Bitmain making ASIC's for ethereum as well:  and that's even with Ethereum eventually moving to PoS.

You could have gotten to the point rather quickly with:


**My whole point was that it doesn't have to be deterministic. Work on a new PoW algorithm which changes it's own characteristics in a unpredictable manner.** Even changing the PoW manually but randomly within a fixed maximum time window (e.g. weekly to quarterly) would lead to less centralization then ASIC's, because the iteration time wouldn't allow for the economical deployment of ASIC's
You are only repeating the same simple fact over and over again. Yes someone will eventually make an ASIC for any algorithm that never changes given the incentive. I've never denied this simple fact.
You repeat this without trying to work beyond the problem, which is the serious problem of miner centralization.  All you're ultimately suggesting is to do nothing. Go ahead and repeat yourself now.
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:37:12
What about a social contract to always change the PoW, to do it constantly, as to avoid ever going back to asics.
Do you think slowly changing the Cuckoo Cycle over time is reasonable?  The theoretical bitcoin GPU miners would have the  incentive to not be displaced by ASIC's and wouldn't face any negative impact to constant reprogramming, constant but random slight adaptions.

Sure I get it, you don't like DCG but here's where I'm at with this situation:
Jeff Garzik himself being the guy that feels comfortable making software and being apart of a company that helps  governments track bitcoin transactions is all I need to know. He's the only developer and maintainer of B2X. 
We can't prove he's a puppet for bankers or government at the moment but in my mind there's two options:
1) He doesn't have the same values the crypto community has if he's going to help Gov't track bitcoin transactions
2) He has no values, he'll accept money to do anything.
and tinfoil hat option:
3) This guy could work for the CIA, trying to take over bitcoin to slowly undermine or control future progress.

I just want to add that while we don't say miners are doing a straight forward "51% attack" they're saying: 
'*We're the miners, do as we say or we'll all leave on the same date starving your chain of hash power, exchanges will be forced to call our new forked chain bitcoin*'
Depends on what you want to call an "attack" right? Miners can mine an altcoin except they're not calling it an altcoin. That's the major difference. They're trying to fork the chain and call it Bitcoin. As Coinbase and other exchanges have said they'll call which ever one that has the most accumulated difficulty "Bitcoin". Obviously they're going to mine the B2X fork at a loss for just long enough to get Coinbase to change the name. How much is the bitcoin name worth? a lot. Enough to mine B2X at a loss? Yes, given how centralized mining is.
Even if you don't want to call it a classical 51 percent attack, it's still all possible because of massive mining centralization, effectively one man in China (Jihan Wu). If you call B2X an attack, then this is a 51 percent attack that is even trying to take the name "Bitcoin".  
Classical definitions of what a 51% attack can do aside... This is what you may be able to do with the majority of the global hash rate.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:36:31
What if one chain doesn't always have the most accumulated difficulty?
e.g. 2X gets "most accumulated difficulty" and is named Bitcoin by coinbase and then a month after that rename happens, the accumulated difficulty switches back to the original chain. 
Would the name Bitcoin keep flopping around based on accumulated difficulty or does it only happen once?

**I believe that most of the global hash rate will stay or move back to the bitcoin chain during the 2x fork and the incentive will work in the specific situation of a possible 2x fork. It is not their incentive to destroy bitcoin because it will be insane.** In that I was only talking about a situation where 2x "took over" the bitcoin chain and investigating the ramifications of the miner's intent.
You can take that simple answer or you may also keep reading but it's not necessary: 


Okay but have you looked at the "bcash" mining distribution chart this morning? 83.33% of the hash power of bcash is being mined by the "mystery miner" while I post this. Are those users happy? Do bitcoin-cash users know, care, or understand the significance? no, because no one is telling them about it.
There’s a valid point to keeping the users happy but keeping users happy sometimes comes down to the miners herding/lying to the users. What is a happy user is defined by what that user is told to believe. Developers are technical, miners are profit businesses, and the users being herded(like farm animals) by one group or the other. To spend their fiat on one or the other. The herd in some regards is trapped like a farm animal, at some point they will switch to an altcoin if they're told they're not happy but they will take some abuse first because this farm has the greatest network effect, it’s bitcoin. Try switching to an alt coin and withdrawing fiat from an ATM machine, can’t do that with an altcoin. 
Some simple historical events shows us the developers want to deploy features that the miners will try to block. Are these features good or bad or users, are they good or bad for miners? Are miners even qualified to know what’s good for bitcoin as a whole?  
Miners are intent on looking out for their own profit, how great would it be if they could guarantee it by controlling the consensus rules. Is what is good for miners always good for users? No. users have no clue what they’re doing, they read garbage about how the lightning network will be run and patented by blockstream. How is that doing what’s good for users. 'Increase the block size to 1GB so you never need worry about newer technologies' good for users or good for miners? Telling users to rely on SPV and let companies run full nodes? Good or bad for bitcoin? The developers are concerned with the decentralization aspects of bitcoin and bitcoin’s health overall, none of which I’ve seen from the miners in reality. They do have different incentives in practice which his been historically observed.
The consensus rules should be developed by people talking to each other and especially people that call themselves  developers, not *only* whoever has the most hash power unless mining were _very_ decentralized, which it is not. Where 80+ percent of the mining power in just a handful of Chinese miners, you call that consensus? On reddit you can get more replies from people then that with just one post.
Users are not trying to 'develop' bitcoin for the most part, they're just trying to use it. I would make the claim that most users would want the developers to provide the path they're on over having the 'miners' dictate that path. Do you think most average coinbase users would understand that B2X may exist on coinbase in the future only because of a invite only meeting in newyork with the miners (NYA) but without any developers?  I think not. The understanding is miners are paid to do a job. They in fact call themselves miners instead of developers.
Even in the benign scenario where say miners and developers just have a difference of opinion over what’s best for bitcoin, there's still a major difference there. A major difference in motive, skills, competency. That has to be accounted for, not excluded by force by just a handful of Chinese miners. Developers have a much different perspective then the users or the miners, they're considering the incentives of both parties in a way that each party cannot do independently because the miners are too centralized, meaning they're such few actual people that know what they're doing.
Because we're not actually dealing with hypothetical people here, the reality today is that I've seen the genius of the devs. I look forward to seeing what the core developers and lightning devs have in store for us in the future because I believe they're the best developers in this field and there is more to come. Show me a new technology even if Satoshi didn't detail it in 2009, I'm okay with that. What about integrating "confidential transactions" for one example, developers will push bitcoin forward, Jihan will not. Last not not least I believe the core dev's will protect bitcoin's store of value and decentralization properties more then the miners. That's just the track record observed.
I do not look forward to seeing what the miners have in store for us. I don't trust Jihan Wu at all, this is in accordance to historical events.(Don't get me started)

You can't change the consensus layer rules of "Bitcoin" without actual consensus, which has to include the developers "core devs", and some exchanges, and an obvious show of support from the users.
What made DCG think they have the right to organize a "bitcoin upgrade" or consensus rule change when they know there was no core dev presence and no communications with the large exchanges
You especially **cannot allow the small group of miners to take over the consensus rules.** That is the first stop to making bitcoin a robust store of value which is the most important feature and without this wouldn't be used by merchants/retail shoppers/etc.  Work on coffee purchases after secure store of value, not before.
A fork "b2x" with one developer(with questionable values) that tried to take over bitcoin is to be laughed at. A handful of miners that think they're able to just get rid of the current development team is totally INSANE.  It goes to show you can have all the money in the world but you still might not get the best developers in the world to work for you, or for any amount of money.

A majority of hash rate is not supposed to be controlled by a few people, these few people can be controlled by the Chinese Gov't because they're Chinese. 
There is a risk of a sudden 51 percent attack which is not at all on the level of shutting down fiat exchanges. If the PBOC ordered the miners to start rejecting certain blocks or all other blocks, or forced them to reverse the segwit soft fork for example, the price will collapse. 
That would be a real attack on bitcoin. Shutting down exchanges is not a real attack, one could argue they just wanted to buy the dip.

With the vast majority of hash power being operated by Chinese citizens, what would happen if the Chinese Gov't or PBOC said "Fork/sensor/signal like so or you will goto prison". Surely all of them will comply with a Chinese Gov't order and it would effect the vast majority of global hash rate.

Right now, one man in china with enough authority can order a 51 percent attack to do the following: 






 As a handful of Chinese citizens operate the majority of hash power, it would be easy to perform a synchronized attack that stops other non Chinese mining pools from mining blocks, or a portion, enough to reaffirm majority at all times. 
What good is having "a lot" of asic hash power if it's made by one Chinese company that could be nationalized or controlled? Which is not unreasonable given what we have seen happen to the Chinese exchanges under the guise of "KYC/AML" concerns, controlling the miners is also a KYC/AML concern for the PBOC. 
Spare me with "there's other players, not just bitmain".. If you want a miner that is half the efficiency as a Antminer, sure you can buy from someone else. Mining is a race, the fastest player wins, the fastest manufacture wins. That is Bitmain by a long shot with no end in sight. Even if there's a new player what makes you think they'll leap frog Bitmain? Bitmain will make faster chips too. The reality is the ASIC centralization is a problem right now.

A 51 percent attacker can choose which blocks to build on top of, it can build only on top of it's own blocks if it wants.

**Batching would save more block space then segwit would (and bring down fees more then segwit would), it should be much easier for coinbase to implement batching then for them to implement segwit.**
**58 percent of bitcoin's blockspace is used by Coinbase**... just one exchange... because they do not batch their transactions like other large exchanges do. So coinbase doing batching should be the biggest priority in bitcoin

Obviously they would be able to control their large customers or else said customer would be cut off from the supply. It's easier to agree with your supplier then take such a risk as to descent. On a more subtle level they could just give other large miners that align with their interests a better deal then miners that don't have interests that align with theirs.  **The centralization factor is that bitmain makes all the mining hardware.** 50 percent more efficient then everything else you can get on the market. Understanding who controls bitcoin's PoW is not as simple as looking at the coin.dance/blocks pie chart.
Bitmain manufactures enough hardware as to easily do a 51 percent attack, that's the real point. They know that the pie chart on coin.dance/blocks can't literally represent such a fact, realize its easy to push more hash power onto "connectBTC" which they also publicly own, or into the "other" category by removing the pool identifier(*pools are the ones that choose to identify the blocks as theirs*) which would make the blocks unlinkable to a specific pool. They could also just send a little hash power to any other pool, it is impossible for a pool to tell who is the source.
Even if they were over 51 percent today with their own mining power, you wouldn't know it. They wouldn't make it obvious.

the call to action that is described in this thread really should be "Open your port if you run a node"  **Node AKA running a fully validating wallet** like everyone should, not just for "advanced users"
**It appears people don't realize that their node is not reachable if they don't port forward 8333 on their router/wifi device**
You can also try enabling upnp from the Bitcoin Core client settings: goto Preferences/click on Network, click upnp. if your router supports upnp the core client will tell your router to port forward.
upnp can be useful if your home router supports it as if your computer's dhcp lease expires, you reboot your computer or it has been off for days, or get a new local IP address for any reason the port forward would be automatically updated without user intervention.
If you take your laptop with bitcoin core running to say a friends house and their wifi router supports upnp, it will automatically open the port as well, making the bitcoin node reachable and actually useful to other people other then yourself

The biggest problems with "Bitcoin Gold" seem to be with lack of developers and that no one really likes the Bitcoin Gold premine even tho many altcoins have started that way including Ethereum.
I'll be careful to not be optimistic because it could all be a lie but during an interview with one of the Bitcoin Gold developers:  he explained the premine will be used to fund developers and is currently being used to fund project bounties to get basic functionality working for launch which softened by stance on the premine. I think there should be absolute and perfect accounting of ALL premined coins, what they were used for and when, this should be made public information.

Who on earth wants to buy a Canaan? You will go out of business immediately as a large pool. The only people buying a Canaan miner are total idiots that want a miner that's 50 percent less efficient then a Bitmain Antminer, those are home users that are trying to make a political statement against Bitmain. Buying a product that is total shit compared to the Bitmain product is not how you compete, it's how home users burn through their electricity for a idealogical belief. Mining is a race, how much money you get is relative to how fast you are only in comparison to other mining hardware or pools. When you choose a product that sucks as much as a Canaan miner, you're choosing to lose. 
I've been waiting for Canaan to improve their product to actually compete but it seems it will never happen. Come on Canaan... 
In terms of **GMO**, that's total bull shit.
After the bitcoin news sites ate this up a correction was made to which many sites didn't repost:


Which means basically whatever you want it to mean. 
It is all because of a few statements from GMO which have been misrepresented, that we hear all this 'news' about Japan entering the bitcoin mining market. This happened so quickly because that's what everyone wants to believe and because of the unscrupulous nature of marketing companies, which is what GMO is. 
Now GMO is doing an ICO, no skills in fabrication, obviously not even using their own money, not using any prior skill other then marketing.
**DMM** news looks only slightly more legitimate then the GMO news. Very little information on their website but their website does say "will be one of the 10 largest mining farms in the world." which means nothing.
*People have always said there will be competition but let me tell you the facts. Thus-far TSMC is regarded as the global leader in 7nm silicon (through my Google-Fu skills) and Bitmain has the largest economics of scale for asic mining chips from TSMC. Why would GMO or DMM be able to produce a 7nm chip before TSMC and therefor Bitmain?* Bitmain and TSMC are both leaders in their respective industries.

Everyone agrees to the fact that if you change the PoW algorithm and you leave it like that, someone may eventually make an ASIC for it no matter how resistant you've made it..
There's no excuse for not trying to work beyond the problem and letting Bitmain control bitcoin's PoW. Lets not have a few people shut down the discussion over what isn't a perfect solution. What we have now is massive centralization and Bitcoin isn't ok with that. We have already kicked this can down the road for too long. The market is made up of "*Bitmain*" and "*The people who buy from Bitmain*", this situation will always give them the largest economics of scale with their silicon foundry, which is also the world's dominate silicon foundry(TSMC), I don't see this cycle breaking by itself or through natural competition.
First start with asic resistant options, e.g. cuckoo cycle, then make slight and constant unpredictable changes to the PoW function on a routine schedule. It's just an example.

Chill out
The post says "it wont count as a node" and he says that because other users can't connect to it. The post doesn't say it's useless.
It "counts" to the person running the node of course, it benefits that user to fully validate the blocks himself. He can do that without relaying blocks to other users (not opening port 8333) but if everyone did that the whole system would collapse. 
Don't be so quick to jump on the semantical rock throwing train. 
It is also useful to allow other people to connect to your node by port forwarding port 8333. It's good advice and it is actually unknown to some people running bitcoin core that other users can't connect. 
**People running Bitcoin Core see  "8 active connections" in their connection stats icon and they think it's other nodes downloading from their computer too, that's wrong. It's just them downloading from other nodes only. Not until you port forward (or enable uPNP in network settings) will you see more then 8 active connections.**
**Check your node here   scroll down and enter your IP where it says "Join the network", it will tell you if other nodes can connect to your node

It's very hard to develop an ASIC for equihash and very expensive. In order to recoup the fabrication cost they'd have to sky rocket the zcash difficulty. When the zcash team realize you can't mine on a GPU anymore, they'll switch the PoW.
e.g. one antminer s9 @ 14TH, the most powerful gpu only 1Gh, you can see here that one single asic is 14,000 times faster than a gpu. It will be noticed or it will have to be kept so low key (as to operate it in secret) that no one would bother putting up the R&amp;D cost under that circumstance. Also considering the coins using equihash use it for asic resistance, it'd be obvious they would modify the algorithm if it were no longer true. This is in part because of a social contract and a clear warning to the public that there will be a PoW switch if needed.
As there's a lot more value on bitcoin, what's good for altcoin's isn't always what's good for bitcoin, with that said work should begin on the development of a new PoW algorithm that morphs and changes in a random or unpredictable manner on a routine schedule.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:30:59
I don't think Core would consider a PoW change, even if 90% of the hash rate forks to another chain. They'd just wait 5+ months (2016 blocks) for a difficulty adjustment, in this case the BTC/USD price will suffer but it will survive. 
(Most people don't believe bitcoin will lose 90% of it's hash power for very long, this is just the worse case. Miners would have to choose to mine B2X at a loss and we'll see how long they want to do that.  **The value is in the consensus.** The chain with less user consensus but more miner consensus isn't more valuable. Even if block times slow down on bitcoin after the miners leave that doesn't actually change the demand for bitcoin's original chain. It will only change the demand for Bitcoin if news websites report that bitcoin is broken. Then people read that news and believe it. Bitcoin may slow down a bit, then correct itself after a difficulty adjustment. Thats all, it's not broken. During this time however many bitcoin 'news' websites will report very bad news about bitcoin failing, especially the news arm of bitcoin.com especially because the owner of that website has waged a 1000 bitcoin bet on the X2 side. After/**If** Coinbase or other exchanges give the B2X fork the name 'Bitcoin' it could make 'user consensus' a very complicated matter or impossible to gauge.)
We have had not much support from the bitcoin core dev's for a PoW switch. 
The PoW switch talk you've heard has come from users or in regards to bitcoin gold.
AMD, Nvidia, Intel, or processor manufactures do not compete in the ASIC miner market. They do not make bitcoin mining hardware and have never expressed an intent to. If someone refers to AMD/Nvidia in a context of mining they're talking about Ethereum,Zcash,Monero, etc. These coins use ASIC resistant PoW.
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:20:18
 This is well said. 
We'll see if the miners are able to hijack the system, if the miners unilaterally change the system. The economic incentive to mine only based on profit is skewed if the miners themselves can control the consensus rules that affect what is profitable, and in turn affects economic incentives. Which is why miners shouldn't be able to unilaterally change consensus rules (if they're very highly centralized), and in this case without the developers.
Do the miners tell the exchanges what software to run or do the developers? In the case of B2X, it's only miners, no developers. 
Which would effectively mean that exchanges and users would always be changing their software*(being told which github repo to use)* for different wallets/coins based on the word of the largest miners(or who ever speaks for the majority set of hash rate at that moment) but realize that you're not always the largest miner, realize today the majority of miners might agree but one week after Joe-Blow-Asic-Company creates one fabrication batch that is large enough to be 51 percent of the hash rate, then you allow Joe-Blow-Asic-Company to tell you which wallet software to use, then Jane-Doe-Asic-Company tells you what software(effectively consensus rules) to use after they become larger, and so on, this is the precedent you set by allowing who ever has the most hash power at the time to change the consensus rules/software which in a ecosystem of very highly centralized mining needs a check and balance. Today's bitcoin ecosystem is one where most large mining pools buy their asic miners from Bitmain. Would Bitmain ever allow another pool that uses their supply chain to challenge their dominance? of course not and no one would even try that because it's not possible because they need a continuous supply. It is very centralized right now, this needs to change as soon as possible.
The miners *(bitmain &amp; people who buy from bitmain)* already have some power, I don't think they should have such added unilateral authority. Especially because if you set such precedent, the miners in the future will/can slowly compound more changes to the btc1 repo, changes to which will obviously favor miners interests moving forward. Exchanges will be pressured to continuously accept all code changes to the btc1 repo after accepting it once. This wouldn't be at all a balance of power, this would be the miners crushing the development team.
I believe the economic assumption made by Satoshi is correct. If it seems not correct then it was only because of the overwhelming centralization of ASIC mining hardware. The fact that the *vast majority* of the global hash rate today is controlled by Chinese citizens itself is a problem(imo) as they(citizens of china) can be compelled by force to collude by an order of their government. It is too much centralization, they're signs everywhere.

It's easy to maintain a social contract to constantly adapt the PoW (e.g. once per year or as necessary)  because all the current miners on GPU's will still be able to mine regardless of how the PoW function changes, they have an incentive to keep changing the PoW so that asic's will not displace them.
Obviously you can't ask miners accept a PoW change. You can if the miners are already on GPU's which will be reprogrammed to adapt to all future PoW changes. As long as you stay on GPU's the miners will constantly support a PoW change.

Just as torjan viruses/backdoors call back to command and control (C&amp;C's) domains that appear to be random to the infected machine (and they can't figure out which domains that single infection will use next)

You can sell "tokens" of a chain that doesn't exist?
Just when we thought pre-mining a chain before public release was how you profit. Viabtc found a way to sell a chain that doesn't exist.  Now that's a profitable business model

Obviously one came before the other

how will the economic majority dictate which chain has the most fee potential (and possibly therefor longest chain) if the best advice to the economic majority(bitcoin users) is not to do any transactions until we know which chain is longer? This is a bit of a chicken and egg problem, no?

Of course it's an altcoin and it should be renamed by the community to BitCash at least to avoid confusion

Basically they're running Shapeshift like business but only between BTC and BCH. 
A way for me to easily sell my **Bitcash/bcash/BCH.** I like it but I'd like it more if Shapeshift did it

It looks like they directed their cloudflare to a twitter URL, their server isn't connected at all.

yeah it's been **under** 80 percent for 12 hours at least, since I've been watching it.

They say 10MB without segwit addresses, 20MB with segwit addresses.
Bcash(BCH) actually has a fixed 8MB block, it isn't "adaptive" or "miner consensus" based. So what does it matter? Without segwit BTX still has a larger blocksize.

It's still sketch, if bitmain really has switched to running BTC1/segwit2x software from jeff garzik and not fake signaling, why hasn't the EC/BU signaling dropped at all?

As stated a LN "HUB" "Node" or even "Evil empire node" in LN can't steal anyone's money. I want to add that there's major strides in privacy in LN transactions. 
The "Evil empire node" has to become known as "the most reliable node" in order to become the largest node. How many people use one node is entirely based on the reliability of that node. (If it can keep channels open for longer then other nodes, determines if you're a good node).
Even if %95 of LN nodes want to use the same Lightning node(The evil-node, because it's reliable) this "evil node" can't tell if a transaction they relay is from the person that started the transaction or if they're just relaying that transaction for someone else because it uses Onion routing, like the Tor network. Paraphrase of Antonopoulos: 
The "Evil Node" has to provide a reliable service, it can't steal money, it can't tell who is paying who. (It has only 1 hop information)
Anyone is able to compete with "Evil Node" to become a more reliable node. It is a fair competition with no other incentive other then to collect LN fees.

Putting up an amount of Bitcoin as a reserve to run a lightning node isn't a centralization factor. How many people on earth have:
1. Money to put into the smart contract
2. An internet connection
3. A computer
Because that's all you need to run a lightning hub or node.
You don't need a special relationship with TSMC or GlobalFoundries like Bitmain has. There's less then 5? companies in world you can approach in order to manufacture 14nm Bitcoin miners. You think having to put up capital money is a higher centralization point then ASIC manufacture(bitcoin mining)?
