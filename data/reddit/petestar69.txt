Can I just ask when you say a percentage of your portfolio - how do you hold these coins, on an exchange (everyone says risky) or in a hardware wallet or something (I understand more secure but then how would you trade if your coins are held in a wallet?).

You dont buy at the rate shown on the chart... you buy at a higher rate, to supposedly cover the, "split" is my understanding.

I am by no means an expert but I think perhaps you are talking about mining rigs... what I have read is that it makes more sense to mine Alt coins and trade them for BTC as BTC mining is unprofitable nowadays due to the increased difficulty. That said I have also read that Bitmain Antminer S9's pay for themselves in a short space of time but have little resale value should BTC plummet - although they are always out of stock or being resold for way too much... I suspect you will get a lot of people saying, "just buy some BTC and hodl as you will be better off in the long run"... personally I just like the idea of a machine whirring away in my back room making me money every day.
Oh and they have cool lights and that is good.

Is anyone expecting a bull run within the next few hours and if so what makes you think that... alternatively anyone thinking bearish and if so why?
Me, I'm thinking bull to 16k in the next few hours based on the new year reinvestment of people.
