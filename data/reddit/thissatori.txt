Cool. And you just use that code they give you to identify your account?
@_date: 2013-03-31 01:07:08
Wow thank you so much. For you it might have been a small gesture but you've done all the work for me! Thank you thank you!
Any recommendations on what I should try next?

Interesting! That gives me a lot to think about.
I live in Tokyo and I haven't had a lot of luck finding places that can use bitcoin here so I don't know how much I would actually use it but I would like to get more into it! 
I had contemplated buying some bitcoins 2 or 3 years ago when I first started hearing and reading about how it works and never did. I wish I had saved up a bunch for the price increase that's happening now!

Do companies like that have insurance that covers them? I know its not like Federal Deposit Insurance or anything but there must be some kind of insurance they can buy...

Me too! I am really sorry I missed this chance. Silly asian timezones...

AWESOME! That worked guys thanks.

How does this work with something like blockchain? There is a .005 charge on it I believe and I was under the impression that this was built into the bitcoin system not something that blockchain.info chose...
If i used multibit or the official bitcoin wallet program is this fee negated?

This is exciting but for me a little sad. I was just getting to know bitcoin and want to buy some but if they are so expensive I feel like I can't invest just now. Wish i knew about this stuff months ago and could be selling at &gt;$90

I live in Japan as well. Have for about a decade. In my experience, almost all Japanese people use google for their searches. Mt. Gox is Japan based but run buy non-Japanese people. Unless you go out of your way, you cannot really find news about Bitcoin in Japan.
I too don't see it as being largely embraced in Japan though.
EDIT SIDENOTE:
Whats your vendor site? I am always looking for more bitcoin stuff in Japan! Maybe you could add it to too.

Awesome thanks for the help!

Do you need verification to purchase from them? I live in Japan and can easily use my Japanese bank account to send them money. But I am not currently verified, so I don't know if I need to do anything else before sending the Yen.

I checked Mt.Gox and they don't sell it except in solid bitcoins. Are there sites that have bitcents available?
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:22:27
This begs the question: Are there more bitcoins than sheep in New Zealand?
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:02:52
Why not use the bitcoin original wallet?
I am also a total noobie here too and haven't set anything up although I am thinking about it.
