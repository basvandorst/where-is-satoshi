I'd think theres probably a bit of both. 
 It's not crazy to think the commentators could be buying and selling their own positions ahead of their coverage, though I'm curious if they can work quick enough against all the other forces that drive attention and price in the market to make that work out in their favor.  And if they are making trades as such, how much pull does CNBC have on this market?  I know having this kind of big media coverage certainly helped drive the "bitcoin mania" and brought in new people to the scene, but are those folks still tuning in to get info on different cryptos? Probably not crazy to think that, either.
As for jumping topics from specific cryptos, regulations, and so forth, we live in the era of the 24/7 news cycle, and as such, we should probably come to expect things to stay frantic on the media.

It would seem best to continue pressing this on them to try and get them to implement it sooner, I imagine the promised shift won't happen to later this year as it stands.
They should definitely also be hiring more personnel to deal with these huge backlogs of wire transfers to deal with too.

Love Vitas, hilarious post.  Watching the price over at GDAX fall (and rise, and fall), what a spectacle.  Should be an interesting time ahead of us this week; here's to the next surge! Bitcoin, altcoin communities alike.

I had tuned the TV to CSPAN to watch this meeting before the Russian investigation update, but I only got in halfway through the testimony, can't believe I missed this.

Submitted my responses, curious to see what results you will be able to pull in general, and more specifically how many more bitcoin/crypto users that identify outside of libertarianism these days, though I suspect they make up a majority still. With that, I imagine AnCaps are probably right behind them, demographically speaking, but we'll see.
Also, when using Google to poll, is there an option to input a specific answer for those who submit an "Other" answer? Never set up a poll with them before, but I'm curious as to those specific details that go unlisted. 
Edit: added "these days"

Maybe i clicked out too early, or maybe it's because I'm on mobile right now, but I didn't see it. I'll check it out on my desktop for sure though, thanks for the response!
