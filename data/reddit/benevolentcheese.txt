But it's not used as a currency. What could even be undermined? Threatening the capital of some gullible people while enriching some lucky others? It's no different than a small scale lottery then.

Yrs, but those legitimate uses are making up only a fraction of a point of its liquidity.  Those legitimate usages would put its value at something around $10/btc. Not $7000.

Other obvious flaws [exhibited right in this thread.]( I think we all know at this point that this subreddit is a lot closer to than Bitcoin is a meaningless speculative bubble the likes of which we haven't seen since the Dutch tulip craze centuries ago.

Maybe your great grandchildren will get to enjoy the fruits of your incredible prescience. Because you certainly won't be seeing any of it.


And instead banking your future in hyperdeflation and an untradeable, illiquid currency? What do you think happens to bitcoin if the worlds banks collapse? Everyone just starts trading it at fixed value and everything is peachy? The price will shoot through the roof far worse than it has been (since it actually *will* have meaningful value then, as opposed to now, when a bitcoin as a commodity is worthless), and no one will be willing to trade it for anything since it will be worth 5% more tomorrow than it is in any given yesterday.

I'm talking magnitude, not volume. The size of that bubble was, what, 1000x true value? 2008 was like 4x at best. Bitcoin is much closer to the former.

Not a ponzi scheme at all, just a speculative bubble. The intrinsic value of the commodity in this case isn't even remotely close to that of its trading price. Read about [tulip mania,]( because this is almost an exact clone of that, only on an unprecedented scale. When the bubble pops—and it *will* pop—it's going to pop hard.

It costs a lot of money to get something like that running, between the equipment, employees, training and contracts. 600k is barely anything for a functioning restaurant/bar. Just remember that when the owner gets 600k, 500k of that is going to go right back to paying off the bank loan.

It already looks basic and primitive.
