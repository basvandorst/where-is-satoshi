No one said he was an angel, just to thank him for this act of support. You want to encourage this behaviour, not just denounce him as permanent scum.

Thanks for reminding me. I had forgotten to give them 1-star after the loss of BTC support.

Yes the GDP surged, but you have to remember the US government was funding the war on debt (deficit surged). Flooding the market with bonds is going to weaken the dollar, not strengthen it.
On top of that, the allies weren't paying with USD they actually owned. The US was lending them their own borrowed USD so that the allies could purchase on a payment plan. So supply was outpacing demand for USD.

One 1919 dollar bought the same amount of stuff then as 14.81 2019 dollars buy now.

[The Great Depression]( was a deflationary depression so there was negative inflation. No idea why people think it's WWII that caused the real value of the dollar to increase. 
US still had the gold standard in the 1930s so no one wanted to invest when the ship was sinking. Lead to the [real value of a dollar increasing from the late 20s to the mid 30s.](

It really demonstrates the power of compounding returns. The US total market compounded at about 10% for the same time period. So $1 invested into a market tracking index fund (ignoring the fact they didn't exist in 1919) would be $13,780 today. 
Moral of the story, holding fiat cash is for suckers. Invest it. 


Here's a [chart of the inflation rate]( 1914) since 1914.

Market booms usually mean higher inflation, dollar pumping means deflation is occurring. 
The dollar pumped during the 1930s because of the [Great Depression.]( US still had the gold standard so USD was seen as a safe harbor from market volatility.

US stock market saw ~10% returns, pre-inflation, for this same time period.
$1*(1.10)^100 = $13,780

Ethereum devs have been begging Bitcoin devs to allow this for years. Bitcoin devs won't implement a trustless bridge, so ethereum can't use a trustless version of BTC. Ethereum has wBTC, 1for1 BTC backed ERC tokens, but it is not trustless as there is still a centralized custodian of the Bitcoin.
All the framework exists on the Ethereum side, if you really want Bitcoin on Ethereum you should lobby the Bitcoin community.

Where: A=$14.83; P=$1; t=100 years
Annual loss due to inflation was 2.73%.

No he is not crazy. He's trying to explain to you that what ultimately governs price is demand with respect to supply.

Seems like that could turn into a nightmare. If the entire federal government collaborated to mine bitcoin they could probably match the hashrate and do a 51% attack. They have supercomputers and a huge pool of resources.

Vitalik, creator of ethereum, holds a very large position in BTC. 
The WBTC project brought a token backed 1:1 by BTC onto the ethereum blockchain. Main downside is that the issuance of WBTC is centralized and not fully trustless.

No, it's the spending power of one dollar in terms of 2019 dollars.
One 1919 dollar buys as much as 14.81 2019 dollars today.

The USA's federal budget is over $4 Trillion dollars. To mine bitcoin, about $4 billion dollars is spent annually. Even if the government had to spend 10x that amount, they could perform a 51% attack for less than 1% of their budget.
They haven't done it because they have no desire to or because they think the cons will outweigh the pros -- they are more than capable of doing so if they wish.

First you have to request Gemini activetrader (their normal fees are ridiculous, never use their mobile app).
And the wait is for the cash transfer to completely clear, I think it’s about a week before they’ll consider it cleared and let you withdraw.

Bonkers that you have to explain this on the OG  crypto sub. The main value proposition of Bitcoin is the decentralization. Node count is one of the best measures of decentralization.

We already have a little bit of socislism: Medicaid, Medicare, social security, unemployment, public school... 
You're acting like a little bit of socialism will kill the US, but you are failing to see we already have a bit of socialism and those programs are extremely popular.

Gemini Active trader. You can instantly transfer up to $2500 a day, and buy BTC with a 0.5% fee. 
They do hold the bitcoin in your account until the transfer completely clears but that’s pretty normal.

I can respect that stance. 
I don't live in Canada, I live in Colorado. 
The Canadian dollar is doing poorly because they put all their eggs in the oil boom basket.

You seem too angry to even read what I'm typing man. 
30% of Healthcare costs are purely administrative in the US. In Canada, due to the single payer program, that percentage is almost zero. So, the Canadian government spends less PER CAPITA on Healthcare than the US government. 
Triple the population, people not paying federal taxes, and you hating socialism are all moot points. They don't change the fact that single payer systems offer better Healthcare for less money. 
 
I'll link to my sources in 8 hours, I'm at work now.

First off: he never said he wants 90+% tax rates. He even realesed his tax plan if you don't believe me.
Almost all of his 'socialist' polices have been implemented in European countries (Germany, Sweden, Denmark, etc.) and they are doing just fine. 
The US already has a ton of socialist programs, what's wrong with expanding the ones with proven benefits? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 15:39:18
We could save money by going to a single payer. The Canadian government spends less per capita on Healthcare yet they manage to offer it to all.
