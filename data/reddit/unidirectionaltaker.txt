I think bitcoin has done its time. Its time to look to a new currency. Does anyone realise that it makes no sense buying anything with bitcoins for less than 30usd?
The cost to send even 5usd is now like 36 usd if u really want it confirmed. Lets face it. No one wants to pay for something then having to wait 7 days for it to clear. The worse part of it is that the price fluctuates to the point during that time where u can lose big time.

There are several reasons bitcoin is dropping right now, mainly due to the fact that many people are unable to get out their monies due to the high fees. This is beginning to feel like a big ponzi scheme honestly. Prices are being manipulated by a small number of people. I suspect there is manipulation also being done by some exchanges. We need an internal audit to be done on some of them.
This coinbase insider trading accusation isnt the only thing that should worry people. Suppose the prices are being manipulated without actual real trades? Has any one ever thought of that? We ought to look more into this

The issue with bitcoins is that too many persons in the dark market have tainted its use. Suffice to say, it was once good as a means to move money anonymously outside the regular banking network. it was also once good to be able to buy small stuff like retail phone top ups etc,like only casino ....its no longer a convenience. I am not here to bash bitcoins as honestly the concept behind it was great, a currency that is outside the realms of the big banks etc. 
However at this point i am disappointed... why? Because more shouldve been done to ensure the system was not hijacked by miner fees. Right now it is unfair for people with millions to be just moving around monies just to increase the cost of fees so that they can be rewarded by higher payouts.
