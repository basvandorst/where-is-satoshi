Wrong. If you want to buy btc anonymously there are other options with are not that expensive. It's just a way to rip off ppl who are interested in investing in crypto but have not idea how to start so they just the atm. Maybe they have heard about the boom last December und new hype in the media so they don't even think about looking for a better price and buy right there.

But it's a scam nonetheless. Selling btc 2000$ above market price is not acceptable. And new ppl getting into crypto /BTC will get burned if they see they just lost a lot of money with that one trade.

You might as well say they saw it coming.

Have a other crypto investments I believe in with all my heart. They will bring the mills and pay the bills.

That's what I call a scam. The provider of these btc atms take advantage of people not knowing anything/enough about it. The folks buying crypto currencies at atms certainly have not idea what the real market price is.

I was lucky in only filled the offer worth ~ 15€. So no huge loses. But I was shocked and panicked. I'm sure it was a typo issue with. and,.

I will never find out, I use btc to trade for other coins. Im not a big btc hodler. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 12:59:48
How do you know 
@_date: 2018-09-25 22:27:27
And how long does it take for BTC to be worth half a million lmao 
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:19:11
Love you, thank you so much brother! I'll use that to buy tons of BTC.

If they offer other currencies they should display their price aswell. Bad programming.

There is maleware on the internet that changes the BTC address you just copied and replaces it with the hackers own wallet address. Not saying that happend to you, but it's a possibility. Always double or triple check with address you're sending to! 
@_date: 2018-10-25 17:06:49
Why doesn't it show the value of the other currencies? 
@_date: 2018-10-08 17:10:38
I have no idea, sorry.

They wouldn't be rewarded for solving science problems, they still get BTC as reward for protecting the network and confirming transactions, its just that their hashing power doesn't go to wast. Every miner competes for the block reward, only one can win. So 99.999% of the electricity is essential wasted.

Most people buy btc and other crypto currencies on exchanges like Coinbase, binance and so on. Those exchanges are companies which have to comply by law. National governments and tax authorities can fore a exchange to give user data so they can take a look if their citizens buy crypto.

Still, it's a good homework and spreads awareness. I wish I was told about BitCoin when I went to school (BTC didn't exist back then, but still). 
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:32:55
Short the banks, long Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:37:56
You get some extra Bitcoin from Coinbase as well =) Merry Christmas

It's a cheap way to own a whole Bitcoin��

"Knete is knorke" is German and means cash is nice. And the ecb thing is also a bad joke.
