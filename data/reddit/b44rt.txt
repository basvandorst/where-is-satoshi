There are alot better options in the Netherlands that are tailored to Dutch users.  We can buy BTC and pay directly from our bank account at transaction time using the iDeal system. 
Examples (i am not affiliated with any of these companies) bitmymoney.com, litebit.eu, btcdirect.eu, bitonic.nl and more.

Guy has to payback 9 million dollar he weaseled away from his clients. He'll be poor when he gets out of prison and that really is the best outcome.

This will always remain guess work. If I have X amount on Address Y and I split this amount in 2 newly generated addresses A and B, there is no way in the world anyone can prove and verify that I own A and B.

You need to pay the miner fee, which is not huge but if multiple big financial institutions are constantly writing to the blockchain they need quite some coins to keep paying for the mining.

Can you please show me how you transfer 1 satoshi with some hashed information for free ? 
You listened to the pre 2014 Bitcoin propaganda too much, Bitcoin transactions are not free, in fact they are alot more expensive than using my legacy banking system. This is because Miners are no charity and they like to get payed for putting your crap in the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-06-23 16:52:55
I'm no expert but I would assume that any 'record writing' to the blockchain by color coins protocols and such still have to pay the fee to the miners.

The GHS price has seen it high that is true. I think the biggest cry babies have shut up about CEX, and the best thing to do to stop a river of idiots flooding into a company like cex is to stop talking about it.
In fact lets just all start making cry threads on how unfair it is how miners can make zillions of dollars by simply running some USB miners (same false assumptions as where made about CEX having 51%)
But idiots will start mining, and poof there is our decentralised network.

You can specify the devices to use for example:
stratum+tcp://pool.vericoin.info:7777 -u user -p password -I 16 -d 0 (This will use your first GPU in that miner window, the rest will be off and useable in windows)
or  -d 0-1 (This will use your first 2 gpu's leaving your third for windows)
Just make sure you plug your monitor in the GPU that you want to use windows, or you will still have bad fps.

This is not how markets work. If oil/ruble was going to moon Bitcoin this is how it would have gone down:
You check BTC price and think LOL WTF HAPPENED, You go on the internet and after some hours maybe days you start seeing that a ruble and oil crash caused this.
If you are reading about it on the news it has already had its effects on the markets, so to break your bubble: Ruble and Oil crashing is not going to change anything about Bitcoin.
And to top it all off: There is no news i  the universe that will make bitcoin moon. The only thing that can turn this market into a bull market is a HUGE influx of new users who need bitcoin and need them yesterday. There is no merchant acceptance story that is going to make this happen, the only way this will happen is when users of bitcoin are significantly cheaper better and faster off while shopping (not OR, AND). 
And this wont happend because merchants are going to want to keep whatever savings bitcoin has to offer in their own pocket. Add this to fact that everyone who bought btc in 2014 can only buy less and less with it with each passing day (bitcoin because deflation !!!!1!) 
And one can only draw the conclusion that right now Bitcoin sucks balls and no one is even thinking of buying this digital ruble (ok bitcoin loses value even faster but lets not become a buttcoiner while im at this) 
What Russian in their right mind would think, gee my monet is devaluating, lets put it in the one thing that has evaporated faster than my rubles....

Sponsor a big gaming team, like a league of legends pro team, or dota 2 pro team. Some game that attracts a BIG audience. Get the scene far enough so that these games actually accept BTC for all the micro transactions, skins, runes, other pay 2 win crap
Gaming is kind of the tech savy people that would be attracted to bitcoin in its current form, don't get me wrong we could very well sponsor Paris Hilton, but I doubt her followers have the intellectual capacity to use Bitcoin in its current state

Are you retarded ? You can never pay a 50 dollar loan back with only 50 dollar.
100 dollar + 6% is 106 dollar. There is 100 Dollar landing in the economy, the FED will want 106 dollar back from an economy that now has a total of 100 dollar. 
So now they will load 206 dollar, to pay back the 106 dollar from last year and have another 100 for this year to spend all spending and so the cycle continues. First year to PHD Economics really don't say shit.

Let me ELI5 it for you:
I think I missed the boat on bitcoin and I cant stand anyone else having a shot at some profits. But if I stay a buttcoiner I will become irrelevant, because bitcoin had long proven to be here to stay. Here comes some form of cognitive dissonance where the mind of the buttcoiner creates a world where people will invest millions in mining gear to secure a ledger with no incentive to do so.
You cant have a peer to peer network without incentivising your peers. This incentive is the coin that they think they can remove from the network.

I have never experienced any problems buying bitcoin on bitonic or bitmymoney and I have bank accounts with both Rabobank and SNS Bank. I do have heared of people using ING that had their buy blocked by the bank, but after contacting the bank they too could buy.
Seems like they are just pushing the boundaries of what they can and cannot do with our money. If you stand up (call) they will let you buy because you and they know that they cannot dictate your money. But if you don't call and give up, that's one more cockblock by the bank

It is only when they are already using it, that they might wake up to its true power. A sheep will never say, oh im such a sheep lets start using bitcoin and become independant. This would require reflection, something alot of people are incapable of

You need billions of dollars in hardware to pull this off for even half an hour. Mining pools that come close to 50 percent don't control the hardware, free miners simply point their miners towards the same pool for a steady reward. But if the operators fuck up the miners will switch pool.

That being said, this thing is actually something the Government is working on, so I bet it is going to suck even more than Auroracoin.

If they are Dutch they most likely only have to turn on the bitcoin option in their control panel. Assuming they use mollie as their payment provider.
/edit: I see this company is located in the province Limburg. I know a store in this province that accepts BTC over the counter. They don't have a webshop but they do custom build PC's and directly accept BTC (no payment provider, no selling pressure, true BTC guys.

The price on CEX is so high because people can mine, keep the mined bitcoins minus fee's and sell the ghs again at (if you bought earlier this month) a profit. All you people getting in panic over CEX just gave them alot of free PR, so alot of new fools wanting to buy in, everyone who was already there before the news is making a killing and laughing to the bank.
So people saying you can't make money on CEX obviously never been there.

I read this, and what annoys me the most is, how on EVERY game forum where you suggest something (does not even have to do anything with Bitcoin) that would be an addition to the current options. As in not replacing anything existing. WHY. WHY. do you feel obliged to foul mouth any idea that does not come from yourself, there is nothing going to change for the people that want to pay with credit card, it is not like this option is going to be removed because they introduce bitcoin. Makes me want to be able to put my arm in my monitor and pull that 11 year old forum troll trough my monitor, beat his face, and put him back in his chair.

It is not greed. When mining on ghash.io you might find alot of blocks, but you have to share those blocks with a hell of a lot of people too. I have mined on Slush, BTC Guild, Ghash.io, Triplemining and Bitminter over the past 2 years. It all comes down to about the same revenue, in one pool you find 5x 0.1 on another you find 1x 0.5 both getting you 0.5 btc.
Right now I have kind of given up the mining fight, I still have a little over 300ghash running ghash.io, so really it is only a drop in the ocean. Im just running this stuff until it blows and keep hodling.
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:44:54
Im not sure, but could this mean that you could have a wallet device signing transaction over a gps-modem ? Basicly meaning that you don't need an internet provider to use bitcoin ?

Haha Op you are funny.  OPEC is somewhat a cause of war.  they enforce the US dollar monopoly on oil trade.  and we have all seen where trying to sell oil in euros will get you (Iraq and libia) so no OP never happening.  Giving bitcoin control to a group of people is just the politicians wet dream they will either kill to get in this group and take every bribe out there or kill anyone inside who doesn't. And that is your government people now wave a flag and be Patriots

Well the whole point of this thread seems to me to make it easier. If neteller would accept BTC to fund your account then this:
Send BTC to VirWox
Sell BTC for SLL (Second life credits)
Sell SLL for EUR
Withdraw EUR to Neteller account (not possible anymore in VirWox)
Use neteller plastic mastercard to withdraw from the account at any ATM
Would become:
Send BTC to Neteller Acount.
Use neteller plastic mastercard to withdraw from any ATM.

For only 19 euro you are not taking a huge risk, and by mining you are helping the network be more secure and decentralised, so i'd say do it ! 
You will learn along the way, and maybe you make back 20 euro or more, maybe you don't. But you can say you where a part of the succes !

--&gt; Im giving some feedback on the site, don't get me wrong, I think the site and idea is wonderful, but here are some of my toughts to maybe make it even better &lt;--
I was just on the website, and it is clean and all. But I think if you want people to sign up and pay 30 something USD per month for a box of candy you might want to put some of that candy on display.
In my 5-10 minutes on the website I did not see any actual candy, so basicly I am clueless to what I am about to pay a monthly fee for that is as expensive as for example a 4G connections with not data limit here in the Netherlands.
I get hungry when I go to the KFC website for only 3 seconds, food does not come to my mind on your website.

No reason to apologise. It's mostly independant miners that go there, and it is a good pool. Anyone is free to compete with them.
@_date: 2014-04-24 10:19:29
You are wrong ;)
Miners can have a stake in the "bitcoin-production" that is going to happen anyway. A mining pool cannot say, let's produce 500 coins NOW. 
As in a central bank being the only one who can produce value, at their willing, it is not something they participate in, they dominate it.

Most likely yes.
But aside from the higher reward when they actually reverse a transaction, there is no incentive for anyone to mine there.
And since you'll need 51% to actually be able to give the slightest appearance of a guarantee of service, and I really don't think anyone will allow this to happen.

You can send a little bit of BTC from the address you want to prove ownership of and include a message with the transaction your name or something that the accountant can see that you did that. Which must mean you own the private key. Ask you accountant for any random word or characters he wants you to sign a transaction with, this way he can be 100% sure.

Ofcourse this is very true, but if people start using Linux for their home computing their will want it for work as well. Its kind of an education thing, you get tought all your life system A, ofcourse you will work with system A. System B might be better but if it requires alot of learning to get the same efficiency from System B people will stick to System A very long until it really dies. Look at fiat and Bitcoin, Bitcoin is inheretely better and more cost effective but no one is going to switch overnight.
That being sad, if I had grown up playing games on a linux machine, i'd probably be working on a linux machine right now, which isnt the case.

The article says:
Students will be given a short introduction on Bitcoin and they will be installing their Bitcoin wallets during this introduction.
After the introduction in Bitcoin they will be able to claim thair 2 euro in Bitcoin. They will also be shown how to use one of the Bitcoin ATM's in Arnhem should they want to buy more.
The organisation has made a deal with local pubs that give Discounts during and even after the Student introduction week (When paying in BTC).
/Note: Seems to me that this could really kickstart the use of Bitcoin for student-drinking in Arnhem, since there is a discount there is anoter motivator at play here.

Very possible, its no theory that the government (which is only an extension of big corporate interests) employs internet trolls just to comment on certain things they want to steer public opinion on. 
It is also no theory that bitcoin is a threat to the status quo, since they derrive their power from the fiat currency paradigm.
It is also no theory that the people in high places are not dumb and are not in those position for letting things go their natural way.
My thinfoil hat theory: everything in bitcoin is up except the price. Big money (and you dont even need that big of a portfolio to pull this off) is trading bitcoin downwards, even swallowing losses for it, to have the plebs sell their bitcoin for cheap.
They know they cannot do this forever, but as long as they can manipulate the price downwards it allows for them to buy for cheap and make bitcoin look bad for plebs that must remain plebs for them to be elite.
If bitcoin would have just mooned in 2013 the wealthy elite, kings queens and emperors would have been nerds like me and you wo where holding bitcoin. This can never happen ofcourse.

My style of comment might have come off as little unfriendly. But don't get me wrong, ofcourse the team behind open bazaar understands that userfriendlyness, useability and competitive pricing are way more important to the average consumer than technical/anarchistical features that most people on this board like. Im very much looking forward to see OpenBazaar evolve into an easy to use e-commerce tool, but as you said yourself; people are getting ahead of themselves.

You can instantly send a small or big percentage of your wealth to anyone else in the world without a trusted third party.

This is made possible because there is a big network of computers keeping track of all the transactions taking place. Not one single entity is in control of the mayority of these computers, hence the trustless system.

Gold has less use than Bitcoin. Don't give me the crap that it is in mobile phones, investors buy GLD on the stockmarket, which is in fact just a paper slip saying you own gold. But in reality you don't you own a paper.
This Bitcoin, which essentially has the same use as that paper slip, can be sent over the internet instantly and is not take-able by any authority. The value of Bitcoin is in its use and its network, not in the currency

People on welfare that regularly sell items on Marktplaats can sometimes be fined  to pay back up to thousand's of euros of received welfare. This is because of stricter laws against welfare fraud.
People who sell regularly on Marktplaats will have to report their activities to local authorities. In case a person cannot prove that profits from Martplaats where small they risk heavy fines and even completely losing their welfare.This was concluded in a research by RTL News into juristical trails held in the past 5 months.
Divosa, the social services organisation of the Netherlands, Stronly advises receivers of welfare to report all their sales on Martplaats. To be able to prove incomes where kept to a minimum people will have to keep administration of their sales.

From my first days in Bitcoin I was always wondering, how much of an idiot does it take to donate his decentralised money from a decentralised system to a central entity that (falsely) represents this system. 
On the other hand those must be the same people that invest in bitcoin and sell within a week because they are anxious...

i will nevery comply with regulation, and that is why Bitcoin is so beautiful :) I can do a trade with another person and there is no third party that can force me to do anything.
There will be enough people stuck in the old paradigm who will wilfuly pay taxes and such over Bitcoin and feel like good citizens doing it. But this was not what Bitcoin was made for, Bitcoin will eventually force the state out of business. The easiest example is Taxi Drivers, Driver A decides to go all out Bitcoin and stop paying taxes, he will become cheaper than Driver B, Driver B will adopt this to stay competitive so will Driver C, etc.
All I can hope is to see the fall of the state before I die.

Well, if you are looking to buy diapers I don't think Bitcoin is going to be very good for your mental health...

You are now connected to Mark from Amazon.com
Me:I read an official statement from Amazon regarding Bitcoin and how you will not be implementing it in your company because there is no demand.
If you guys where accepting Bitcoin payments I for one (and alot of others I know) would be buying Playstation 4 consoles from your website, since they are not readily available in my country.
We don't all have credit cards, and we don't want those. It does not hurt your company to start accepting it, so chop chop get working on it.
Thanks in advance

Regulation on BTC works kind of like a Don't pee here sign. There will be lot's of people that don't go and pee there, but there are also people that will ignore the sign and pee there anyway. There is no way you can know who peed when. 
In the end, the people that ignore the sign will have an advantage over the people that adhere the sign. Forcing the adherent people to also ignore the sign to be able to compete.

True, they are noth worth more than other coins, but I mined them myself back in 2012 and for me this does make them 'special'.
Im not lazy and im not counting on the work of others... If you hold on to gold but you don't work in the gold industry, that does not make you a bad investor. I'm not good at building infrastructure for payments, but I do feel like I can tell if something is going to go up in value over time, so that's what I do. 
I really don't see a reason to call me the worse kind of Bitcoin investor, in invested time, money and energy into buying and mining Bitcoins.

If only 1 small country with 25 million people would adopt bitcoin on a big scale there would never ever be enough bitcoin for everyone inside this 1 country to be able to own a whole BTC or more. I don't think 30-40k per bitcoin would be close to enough.

You should install the latest catalyst driver and use cgminer 3.1.1 newer versions might not support gpu mining.

Mining is pretty self-regulatory, if a miner decides to quit this gap will be filled by other miners. About centralisation of mining, a pool like ghash.io still consists of hundreds or thousands of individual miners in control of their own hardware.

I can only really explain it from a gamer point of view. You have certain information about something (the structure of the atoms) or ( the zero's and one's in your computer model) and when you put them trough a render engine, you willl get a result. 
You take the structure of the atoms of gold, and rendered by the universe it becomes this shiny stuff we like. But rendered by a greater consiousness in a higher frequency, this structure of atoms become's something of greater purprose.
To get back to the computer comparison, you'r old file, will render better trough the directx11 render engine than directx9.
This will really make no sense if you don't know a little bit about computers, but it is the best explanation I can give.

It is only logical. Companies want to enter data into the blockchian, they have to move some bitcoin (but it can be from and to an address the company owns). But the company will have to pay the TX fee to get their information on the blockchain. If this is going to be used world wide, the demand for Bitcoin is going to go up, and so will the price (i guess)
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:26:31
Even with multiple nuclear bombs, you cannot bring down the power grid worldwide and you cannot bring down the internet world wide. This is such a retard arguement that I have been hearing for so many bitcoin years now. Nobody can turn of the internet world wide.

You take some information, you hash it. You attach the hash to a bitcoin transaction. This hash is timestamped into the blockchain. 
You send the information to someone, he doubts if the information is still geniune, he hashes the information and compares to the hash on the blockhain. Hashes are the same, Information is still the same as at the time of stamping.

You can trade GHS/BTC and other crypto pairs on CEX.IO, they charge a fee on trading. When using the CEX.IO Cloudmining service to mine on Ghash.io you pay 0,29$ per ghs per month maintanance which automaticly is deducted from your block rewards.

In my country's version of takeaway.com you can deliver food with BTC for over a year now and their Chief of operations over here said they where surprised with the rapid growth of people paying with Bitcoin since they launched it.

@_date: 2014-06-17 12:14:20
OP is right. CEX/GHash.io does not have monopoly on anything, they did not cheat to get where they are. They are just a good pool with 0% fee's. It's in the miners self interest to go with ghash.io.
But there being no monopoly, there just has to come a second and preferably third pool that can compete with each other.

You do realise that with the current blocksize we will never be able to proces more than 7 transactions per second. Which is just a drop in the occean of VISA or Mastercards volume.

I think what OP means by credit card is not a card that pays something and you can pay back overtime, but a plastic card that would make spending the BTC that you already own easy. So more like a BTC prepaid  credit card.
Which is a nice idea, but im sure there are already people working on something like this.

I'm not FOR a 51% pool. Im just saying reddit is really blowing it out of proportion. Half the nitwits commenting about this don't know what they are talking about. Cex is right now finding about 43% of the blocks this does not mean they have 43% of the hashrate, aside from that when they are really evil, the majority of bitcoin nodes could choose to ignore the mining that comes out of CEX essentialy giving them 0% hashrate. 
The point is people need to shut up and listen instead of scream their ignorance in everybodys faces, causing panics and what not.
This 51% is not a real world problem and the sooner you people understand this the better your night sleep is going to be.

There is 0% capital gains tax in the Netherlands. You only pay "vermogensbelasting" ~ wealth tax. But only if your assets are worth over 30.000 €. Everything from 30.000 up to 100.000, so 70K if you are holding 100K,  will be taxed a whopping 0.6% per year. Over a 100K the percentages go up slightly, but I'd say the taxes for holding bitcoin here are prettly neglible.

First you will wait.  Bitcoin Core is a full wallet, which means it will download the complete transaction history of Bitcoin to your computer.  This will be about 200 GB give or take. 
Then you will buy a tiny amount of bitcoin, sent it to your core wallet.
Then you will send that tiny amount of bitcoin away from your core wallet.
Now you know you can put funds in, and you know you can also get them out again (important). Verifiying that you have the correct passwordt etc. 
Then you maybe want to look into a more user friendly wallet like Electrum.

1. No
2. Wat ?
3. I cant hold all these wat's ?
4. Maybe they understand something you(r friend) don't
5. They pay a fraction of a penny to move bitcoins from one address to another, that is exactly the service they pay for
6. This is not a question but an expression of opinion, be it an uninformed one.
7. The more powerful computers become the more powerful encryption and privacy technology can become (your silly arguments almost all work in both ways)
8. It removes an expensive third party from financian transactions
9. 99% of all 'normal' money only exists on servers owned by banks, at least with Bitcoin you take the control away from a single entity
10. When something bad happened on the scene, some holders decided to sell of their coins, the Bitcoin network itself is still operating and has not stopped operating due to any of these arguments.
11. It is not the SHA bytes (SHA256 infact) but the fact that you can transfer value trough it. (utlity)
12. No you can't, prove me wrong.
13. You pulled that out of your ass.
14. Difficulty/blocktime self-regulated.
15.  It has came this far with P2P infrastructure, what fundamentally has changed to make this impossible now ?
16. Hold my wat's pls, this makes no sense
17. We do not rely on gold, inflation is not things getting more expensive, but the money supply being inflated. This is impossible with Bitcoin

The protocol is in its very core not private. Anyone can access the network with equal rights, Bitcoin "deposit boxes" open for anyone that can put in the corresponding cryptograhpical key.
This is the power, anyone in the world can use a depositbox/private key to store value, and when they want transfer it to someone elses box/privatekey. 
To take away this power from Bitcoin is to make it a legacy payment network

As nobody really answered WHY everyone withdraws on this specific day:
The importance of everyone withdrawing their coins from exchanges at the same time is in the fact that said exchanges must have every bitcoin of their customers in their possesion. 
Some exchanges will use the bitcoins their customers deposits, and when said customer withdraws they will just send them anyone else's bitcoin.  As long as most of the customers dont withdraw at the same time nobody will notice. 
This is what happens with fiat money every day, day in day out.  Here in Crypto we decided that we will not allow this sort of je--- uh trickery. 
That's why the whole community withdraws at the same time, so that solvent exchanges survive and dirty exchanges die out.

I'd say the foremost reason for anyone to chose something like OpenBazaar over something like Amazon would be restrictions, both from a buyer and seller point of view.

A seller might be looking to sell items of questionable legality in his/her country/state
Both can provide in each other's demand where a site like Amazon would make the trade impossible.

You could view a nodes as people torrenting the blockchain to each other and miners as the people that verify the integrety of the information that is shared trough the nodes. 
Litteraly the miners are performing SHA-256 Hashing operations until one of them 'finds' a correct hash and then it starts again at a new block, with every verified block of transactions rewarding the miners with a preset amount of bitcoins plus some transaction fee's that people might have payed for priority.

This is the reason we are not ready for the moon yet. Any savings BTC offer fade away after processing fees tx fees cc fees and ferrari fees when buying them, add to that the complexity of buying bitcoin

I'm pretty sure that if the market would move to OpenBazaar, OpenBazaar would be very very quickly developed.

Well you are free to transact on chain as you like, there just wont be an economic incentive to do so if your TX was gonna be cheaper on the LN.

In this analogy the bottom really reflects core more. They keep an artificial cap. The top is like bcash, just open the network open to more base traffic. 
Don't get me wrong, I am hodling BTC but this is just a wrong analogy.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:40:40
Well you use the main chain when opening and closing channels. Its basicly not much more than opening a multisig address with a stranger.

No its not luck to not go all in into a highly volatile asset. Its called common sense.

Theoritically youll receive tx fees, in practice they are going to be neglible unless you have a big funded channel that alot of people might use. 10+ bitcoin in your channel.

Probably fake but I just came in to poop the party and say that birthcontrol is one of the worse inventions ever.
Isnt bitcoin and crypto all about taking responsibilty ? These pills absolve resposibility.

Hover over the "connection" icon on the bottom right of the QT wallet screen. If you have 8 or less connections than you don't have the right ports forwarded in your router and you will not be helping the network until you fix that.

That should not make a difference if a US resident can use it. 
Bitmex is based in Hong Kong, still no US customers allowed.

Why so butthurt? The Balkans is an area around the Balkan Sea, the european union is a political/trade union covering many many more countries and areas. So its just factually wrong to say the balkans is the same as the european union... Im not implying the balkans are below or above any other country or people...

Probably the stage were you realise you invested money that you could not miss? Hence your emotions.
Rule 1 Only invest money you can afford to lose.

Your channel will not be able to do any transaction amount higher than your channel total. People will be incentivised to connect to channels with a larger "escrow" amount than you would/could want to sent over the network.

You probably cannot make accounts for exchanges at your ages. 
If you do find a way to get your money on an exchange, don't spend it all at once. Spread the 200€ in smaller buyers over the time it takes you to get new funds to the exchange. 
When you have gathered any significant amount, move it off the exchange into a wallet that only you know the keys to. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:29:48

The best thing you can do is buy for a dollar amount that is something you would not miss if you lost it every week/month for 2 years. 
That way the only way you can do bad is if it all goes to 0.

I think there are more sellers than buyers at this time. Causing the sellers to sell trough the orderbook, lowering the price. 
But I might be wrong...

This is probably gonna be a dumb question but... aren't satellites supposed to orbit the earth ? How can they cover a certain region ? eventually they should have passed all regions no ?
