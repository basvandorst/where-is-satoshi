If "political correct as fuck" means treating everyone according to the law, then it doesn't matter who it is because the law treats everyone equal. Innocent until proven guilty; if he actually did it then they should find him guilty. If they can't prove it beyond reasonable doubt then we can't say he did it. Assuming the justice system is fair and all.

Because unless that difference is between two different kinds of delivery system (like copper wire vs fiber optics), then any limitations on bandwidth are just the ISPs artificially limiting the speed. If they cannot consistently deliver a speed, they shouldn't be able to advertise at a speed. Every customer should be getting the maximum capability of a network, not just getting what the company says you get (without being able to get a competitors service, usually).

Oh my god why didn't anyone tell Karl Marx! He could have avoided spending his entire adult life compiling scientific observations of the operation of capitalism if only he had remembered human nature!! But in all seriousness how do you know what human nature is? We're products of our environment, you can't separate the two. 
"To look at people in capitalist society and conclude that human nature is egoism is like looking at people in a factory where pollution is destroying their lungs and saying that it is human nature to cough.” -Andrew Collier

This whole thing is amazing from the very beginning, for those that are seeing this after it's over, I suggest taking 3 hours to watch it. I am way more hyped up about bitcoin right now.

You want the NET to remain NEUTRAL? So you are in favor of net neutrality.

I mean I also disagree with the idea that you can bring about a socialist society without at least a transitionary period of centralized government, but there are people who hold those beliefs (with plenty of literature written by anarchists in the past to back them up). Unless you think that ancaps are the only true anarchists which is definitely incorrect.

Do you not think it would be? We're not an agrarian monarchy in the early 20th century, for example.

No, they're anarchists.

The future isn't determined by ideas, it's determined by the material conditions that people exist in. If an idea is great, there's no way for it to change anything if there's no way for the people with that idea to act upon it or convince other people of it.
As brilliant as the idea of Bitcoin (and the block chain) is, if there was no internet than there would be no way for Bitcoin to have the impact we're seeing today.

Socialism can be designed with the idea of freedom and self-interest in mind. Under capitalism, the less money I have the less freedom I have; under socialism it is in my self-interest that the community benefits because I am a member of that community.

Black bloc is a pretty well known anarchist tactic, what makes you think they weren't anarchists?
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:49:03
I don't think I would make that claim but it's probably true that some of those people supported Sanders then became anarchists. Idk what you're trying to get at with that second question though.

I guess it's tough to really secure things, and you would need to go to more lengths than just buying a bitcoin wallet.

Well it didn't end in past attempts, sure. But you can't ignore the material conditions of the societies where the revolutions occurred.

Facebook has a much greater diversity of users compared to youtube and reddit.

It's only become that due to misinformation being spread about what it actually means. What it stood for before right wing news started pretending it was about the government controlling the internet.

It's convenient to dismiss an entire economic school of thought on the basis of logic, as if the 150 years of historical analysis provided through the lens of Marxism is based on something other than logic, rather than trying to understand them to dismiss them based on legitimate criticisms. It's true that attempts as socialism during the 20th century have failed to create a real, worker-run economy and government, but that's more to do with the material conditions in those societies (such as levels of industrialization, wars waged upon them by capitalist countries, or CIA-backed coup). The ideology is much more than just "everyone gets free stuff" but I don't expect most people to know that already, especially considering the amount of propaganda fed to Americans during the Cold War and today.
As to whether we can judge it based on whether people have or haven't voluntarily created a socialist society, I'd say that's a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of the way that power structures exist and change in society. If it were as simple as everyone deciding that a certain way of structuring society is better to cause a change in society, there would never have been a need for revolutions to occur. Unfortunately the class of people in power don't decide to give up their position based on whether everyone agrees with them or not.

Why would the people who benefit most from the current system (the billionaires) fund revolutions to change that system?

I ordered a half pound of each test pack, since I wanted to try all the different kinds. It was really easy to pay with bitcoin!
