25 words, or 25 four letter/number codes? If 25 words, don’t share them or show them to anyone or else your bitcoin can easily be taken by someone else. 
Hmm if it is those codes maybe it has to do with google authenticator or authy?

Do you think $3300ish was the bottom?

Thank you! Of the links you posted any you recommend or use?

Does a full node have to be online 24/7? Can you benefit from running one a few hours a day or week? Is running a full node the same thing as using the bitcoin core wallet? Thanks

Both would be nice. A few bucks a month might go a long way 10+ years from now

Awesome news!

In your new wallet, navigate to where you see a “receive address”. Copy the address. Now on the cash app, click “withdraw bitcoin”, paste the receive address from your new wallet, and send the max amount.

I’m not sure you could try asking over at r/Coinbase.

I mean don’t store your coins long term on exchanges. Buying on an exchange and then immediately transferring them off to your personal wallet is OK.
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:56:26
It allows for fast transfers of bitcoin off-chain.
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:38:43
Yup. Also since exchanges hold large amounts of bitcoin they are likely more of a target of hackers than a single user. 
Also exchanges can freeze your funds or close your account at anytime for any reason.

Would you rather own a bar of gold or a piece of paper that promises you a bar of gold?

[Trezor]( is easy to use and has advanced features. Hardware wallets store your coins offline even when the device is plugged in. A mobile wallet stays connected to the internet which isn’t recommended for larger amounts.

Interesting what you are saying about billionaires possibly investing 1% of their wealth and the % appreciation thereafter. 
Wouldn’t this make the bitcoin market prone to large % loss if billionaire investors decided to dump after large % gains?  
Where are you getting the recent “mere 100 million USD in fiat coming in” data from?

If it is just a backup, you could just update the firmware   down the road before you load your wallet onto it.  No need to do this every few months. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:06:42
Is there a private key inside or on the back? Could have value associated with it (don’t post the private key if you find one).

Look into buying a Trezor hardware wallet. [ They are easy to use yet have advanced features as well. Your security goes up dramatically by using one. 
Make sure only to download newer electrum versions from electrum.org. Be careful not to download electrum from pop ups or messages. Many users lose funds to hackers this way also known as a phishing attack.
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:16:37
This is something you might want to ask over at r/bitcoinbeginners only because I feel a $69 Trezor is worth it. They’re easy to use yet have advanced features as well.  I’m not too familiar with cheaper solutions.

Any comment on my previous reply?

All of the SV drama is a distraction from the facts that the lightning network keeps growing, the next halving is a year away, on chain transaction fees are low despite a high # of transactions, countries like Venezuela are using bitcoin to not completely drown in hyperinflation, it’s incredibly easy to get some bitcoin using cash app, amongst other things.

You don’t need to change anything about the word seed. Just update the ledger device as needed. The addresses linked to your word seeds don’t expire. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:02:12
If you lose your device as long as you have the paper backup that you create when you create your wallet you’re fine. The paper backup could be stored in multiple different locations and even on [stainless steel](

You can increase the number of bitcoins you own in such ways as buying bitcoin, mining, receiving donations/tips, or accepting bitcoin for goods and services.
However, mining is a very specialized industry these days and requires very very expensive equipment (hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment possibly more) and you’ll need a lot of research done. 
You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin. You don’t need to buy a whole 1 or many. Only invest what you are willing to lose. 
Let’s say you own 1 bitcoin worth $5000 and the price goes up to $50,000 a bitcoin. You’re bitcoin is now worth that much. You could sell it for conventional currency like dollars, you could continue saving it, or you could spend it. 
This could work the other way around if bitcoin decreases in value. 
Note: when your bitcoin increases in value and you spend it or sell it for dollars, you have to pay capital gains tax. 
You have to understand that greater than 25% drops in price happen. You want to invest only a small portion of your total net worth as not to panic sell if these drops happen. A good bitcoin investor would be ok with a 25% or more drop and not sell for a lose, hoping the price will increase in the future. 
[ is a good place to start.
