Get out of here with your facts and critical thinking!

I know it's hard to admit you're wrong, but sometimes the right time to do so has arrived.

[Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer **Electronic Cash** System](
"Low fees" are in fact a defining characteristic of a currency... The USD has no direct fees, but needs to be physical transported or electronically transported. That's your fee. That's the work to transact.

Yes they're inefficient and should be streamlined quite a lot. That doesn't mean that a new enterprise should emerge that is equally or more wasteful. I love the idea of bitcoins, but personally I'm hoping that takes off. The power usage goes towards protein folding for medical advances and other scientific endeavors. 
That to me is much more meaningful.

I would never advise buying except directly from the manufacturer. It could seem fine for years. It's likely it is fine. Is it worth the risk though?

Can you clarify what you mean here? I am guessing you meant BCH? BTC at $800 is not in the cards right now.

Where'd he speak in the third person? I must have missed it.

Dunno if you got your funds recovered, but I heard that it is possible to recover Segwit funds maybe. [Here's a source]( Not sure if it works.

If bitcoin is destroyed, at a bare minimum the internet is destroyed.

Hard to be sure. Looks like Jamie Dimon maybe.
