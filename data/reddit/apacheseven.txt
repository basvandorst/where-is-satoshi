Why will volatility decrease in time? Bitcoin's value has increased dramatically over the last 12 months, and daily volatility is worse than before.

Is this accurate:

Cool I'll start.
What real utility does any payment method have that is highly volatile? Nobody wants to use it when it's increasing in value, and nobody wants to accept it when it's decreasing in value. Volatility makes Bitcoin useless as a real world solution.

Is there a good chain explorer yet that can highlight recent transactions that are SegWit?

I'm also interested in this

Do you mean that a transaction that is in mempool can be intentionally removed later, or unintentionally could go missing due to forks etc?

Thank you!

It will disrupt block creation and delay transactions badly for a while. Difficulty recalc is every 2 weeks, but could become longer if miners ditch.

Trading is very suspicious on bitfinex. 1000 btc walls getting eaten in sudden yet consistent ways. The Tether accusations may turn out to be something big..

These walls were eaten, not cancelled
