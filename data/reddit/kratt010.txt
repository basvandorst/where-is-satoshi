Just because your calling me a fraud and a virus here's the tactic:The tactic is bet the smallest amount on 2x (this is for from faucet) and keep betting until you get 2 losses in a row. Then bet 100. Most of the time that bet would win. If it doesn't , go all in. That has almost absolutely no chance of failure. Repeat. When you get more you can change the base bet to 1000 when you get 2 losses in a row (and after bidding after 2 losses in a row go back to the smallest amount you can bet.)

1, dont invest your own money just use faucet
2,random number generators don't like to do LOOONNNG streaks and 2 is around the minimum
3, if you don't want to go all in bet like 1000
