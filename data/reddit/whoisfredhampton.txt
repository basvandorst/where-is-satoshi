The best thing you can do right now is research. Andreas Antonopolous is one of the most respected Bitcoin experts in this community and he has a ton of videos on YouTube. His talks are so inspiring and he helps you to not only understand the technology, but also to see why it is so important.
This is one of his best videos for beginners that doesn't get too technical, but it is a great start. \[[
Once you get inspired by the beauty of the technology and how it can change the world, you will have a hunger to learn as much as possible about how it works. Watch a few of his speeches and then enjoy the journey down the rabbit hole!

As of today I am 100% in control of my Bitcoin! I've taken every satoshi off of exchanges and control my own keys! I encourage everyone else to do the same.
Edit: Thank you everyone in this community for all the great advice along the way!

Awesome! Now you just have to stay drunk for 3-4 years so you don't accidentally sell while sober!

In December of 1995 there were 16 million internet users worldwide, in 1999 there were 248 million. Were there much more user friendly options on the internet in 1995? If you tried to describe Reddit, or Twitch, or YouTube, or Google, or Facebook to the average person in 1995, what would their reaction be?
Spend some time checking out Andreas Antonopolous on YouTube. He does a great job of explaining Bitcoin. If you spend enough time learning about it one day it will click.
Edit: Just realized I stole that last line from u/wsheep.
