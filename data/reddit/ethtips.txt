Don't forget to have the new laws retroactive for the past few years, as the IRS has essentially been sleeping on the job and we've been waiting for them.

XRP is special in my mind because it can't be mined, only new coins are added by a group of people who decide to do so. (For their own gain or whatever.) This makes it a special NEGATIVE in my mind!

USD is also not based on thin air. There's this guy that (seemingly randomly) makes monetary policy for USD, lol.

XRP has a great marketing team. They have definitely put the fancy lipstick on that pig. It's not like Bitconnect, where they used the cheap dollar store lipstick.
Bitcoin doesn't need any of those tricks, luckily.

You're not thinking about the problem hard enough. Gold is backed by collusion of gold mining companies to not mine gold too fast or too slow. Otherwise its value would be even more volatile.

Token Taxonomy gives you a nice tax break as well if you've pushed around crypto between alts in the past 2 years. Everyone in Crypto should be pushing for this to pass.

Bitcoin doesn't work well over interstellar distances. You'd actually want a clone of Bitcoin that has longer block times. (Since interstellar communication can take many minutes, and you'd want to be sure nodes at both ends are in consensus.)
This is true even if you just wanted a coin that can work anywhere in the solar system. Like some kind of... MarsCoin?

That's not the only way. You could also move to Puerto Rico.

You can't be in consensus from Mars without some sort of Ansible. Mars latency goes from 6 minutes to 40 minutes depending on the time of year. You'll sometimes be in consensus, and sometimes not.

You're probably better off picking a random day of the month and sticking to that, than picking the 1st of the month and getting a higher cost because everyone else is picking the 1st of the month, limiting the supply.

Use Chrome Mobile (copy the link there if you need to). Click the green lock at the left. You'll see "Connection is secure". Click "Details". You'll see "Entrust Certification Authority - L1M". Click "Certificate information". You'll see "Issued To: Organization: Fidelity Investments (FMR LLC)".
Technically, since the certificate is not an EV SSL (Costly), you can't know for sure that the business entity stated is the actual business entity who the certificate belongs to. (EV SSL basically is just more hoops for the Certificate Authority to jump through, and verify your business articles of incorporation or something like that.) But, it's likely that a Certificate Authority (CA) won't issue a certificate under a company name to a different customer of theirs if they already have an existing customer with that company name. (Or, at least, I'd hope it works that way. It might even depend on the CA. Example: if I go to Baltimore CyberTrust Root, who issued the certificate for [microsoft.com]( and ask Baltimore CyberTrust Root to issue me a cert for [microsoftsucks.com]( and I say that my company name is also Microsoft Corporation, you *hope* this would set off alarm bells at Baltimore CyberTrust Root.)

Oh I definitely agree, lol.


I agree there too. Their share price, or value proposition, or whatever it is, will suffer because of it.


This might apply if they used a different business name. However, it's the same business name. :-) They are both under one legal entity. I think this was purely done for technical reasons, probably the sysadmins of [fidelity.com]( couldn't be contacted in time or couldn't fulfill the request in time, or some clueless PHB somewhere didn't know the process. (In a huge corporation, that sometimes happens.)

Also, earning any job/regular income "counts against you". (As the poster below me said.)

Look beyond the tiny discount. Somewhere, someone got an owner to accept Bitcoin (or the owner is deep into Bitcoin themselves and also owns "RowanPay"?), and spent.... $200? Something like that? On a fairly high quality outdoor sign. (Not just a cardboard poster.)
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:41:09
$0.40 BTC discount, but they will give you a terrible price per BTC maybe? lol... (plot twist?)
Maybe they will need a sign out front that changes with the BTC price?

When it's on their system as USD, or when it's on their system as a tradeable asset? Because I guarantee you, the FDIC does \*not\* insure against crypto losses, lol. (If Robinhood says: "Whoops, we literally misplaced all your crypto or something".)
Also, the FDIC does not insure stock brokerages. You might be thinking about SIPC. Also, SIPC doesn't protect against loss, it is just a rule for fair liquidation against a corrupt brokerage, for instance.

All it takes is some bright idiot from Robinhood saying: "Hey, we're not actually \*giving\* them Crypto... we could just avoid buying the asset and instead just increment a number on their screen for them..." (Then a bunch of people cash out, or try to, and it all collapses.)

This reminds me of [equifaxwegothacked.com]( or whatever their site was. Instead of [sorrywegothacked.equifax.com]( or whatever.
Either the sysadmins have made it impossible to add on a new subdomain, or the business people are too stupid to realize how domain trust works.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:28:14
Interesting! Here's what makes it trustworthy though. The SSL cert matches the [fidelity.com]( name. (So either they got their cert stolen, CAs have gone untrustworthy, or ... [fidelitydigitalassets.com]( is legit!)
"Fidelity Investments (FMR LLC)" (Both sites are from Entrust's CA. So either Entrust *really* screwed up, or it's legit!)

No. Strictly, the sign says $0.40 Off A Gallon.

How do you think buying cars wouldn't trigger an audit? Seems like a lot of paper trail with that.
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:19:19
Don't forget that the IRS goes by two rules during an audit (I am not an attorney, I am not a tax professional.)
1. Did you have malicious intent to pull the wool over the IRS's eyes? ("Tax Evasion / Tax Fraud")
2. Did they find out you actually owe them more than $2,000 during a tax audit?
If the answer is 'yes' to both, you might be spending jail time. Be careful computing your taxes!
