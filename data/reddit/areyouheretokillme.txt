it happens
@_date: 2014-01-21 12:43:28
no they don't .... they really don't hold their value, try buying a 20 year old rolex online....
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:47:35
That made me so happy when I found it. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:44:44
try this

TIL I once applied for a passport for Sealand. When I was rejected, I planned a coup. (coup didn't happen as was approx £40k short of target)

'majority of adullts' - really!? - every single adult I've explained bitcoin to has understood..... 
Also, a HS freshman doesn't have to be a genius to do this, they just have to have an interest in bitcoin/economics. 
Impressive not so much.

Yeah the weather is prone to change.

In all honesty the people likely to ask me about my mining are generally going to be people with IQs over 80.
It doesn't take a lot of intelligence to understand that Bitcoin is to Fiat as e-mail is to posted letters.
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:47:51
Lol. As I am in negative equity I can't see that working out well for me.
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:03:05
How much did that cost you?
@_date: 2014-06-04 07:39:35
1600 GBP for an 18 carat ring worth approx 150-200 GBP 
At tops it's worth 1 BTC not 4

Only if you explain it badly. Firstly why would you intentionally try and confuse someone whilst grocery shopping? If you were explaining to the checkout girl, you'd explain appropriately for her perceived intellectual ability; explain that bitcoin is an online currency that you can transfer around the world in seconds, with almost no fee, then give them an analogy. Explain that digital currencies are the future of banking and soon they will more than likely become commonplace. If you're not selling her anything then why would she think it's a scam?
Just my opinion but I think you have an overinflated feeling of self worth, people aren't *THAT* stupid generally.

Ah now you're talking bollocks. Where I live, anyone can get a debit card. I don't have a credit card and I've got a debit card. I buy everything online through debit card and have never struggled. 
Your entire premise is that credit card is the only way. Not true at all pal, not by a long shot.
Buying a holiday, tick.
Buying off ebay, tick.
Buying off amazon, tick.
Buying groceries online, tick.
I make almost daily purchases online with a debit card and have never needed a credit card.
End of argument isn't it pal

I was just about to deposit some bitcoins... thought I'd google your business first. Glad I did, I evaded your little scam. You Sir are a CUNT of the highest proportions. I hope you die a slow death, I hope your family get cancer and suffer slowly before your eyes. You sick, vile, disgusting excuse for a human being. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 07:27:15
What a ducking rip off.
@_date: 2014-06-08 08:44:07
Well then they need to get themselves bank accounts (or bitcoin) if they want to shop online. That doesn't change OPs premise being entirely incorrect. Anyway he's deleted his post and ran away, so I think that means most people agree with me.
@_date: 2014-09-25 05:42:49
The two are strongly linked. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:59:23
Bitplastic is defo a scam. Confirmed 100%
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:48:35
Beg borrow sell and steal :)
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:42:44


I think you're wrong with your understanding there mate
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:30:08
Gay-douchery to the extreme
@_date: 2014-03-21 10:38:30
Must've hit a nerve. Basically what I was saying is that you're an egotistical prick and you think you're better than everyone else.
Protip: You're not. Quit trying.

After a couple of beers I often moon a bit.

My generation (I'm in my 30s) will see a heck of a lot MORE technical innovation by the time we croak.

Genuinely happy for you. Wish I was too.
