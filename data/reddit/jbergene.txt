Why exactly is it so bad? Yet to see someone come up with a good argument. Only feelings

It's fucking GIGANTIC. don't know the numbers because nobody gives them out.
Just like fuel vs electric cars, oil Companies stopped giving out emission numbers in 2004.
You actually use more electricity just to refine the fucking gas, than driving 1 mile with an electric car. On top of that you have to burn the gas in the car which use just as much CO2.
I fear it's the same with centralized fiat servers.
You need many many backs up systems which can also handle the TPS. Blockchain naturally has those backups. It's in the blockchain. Can't take it down.

its pretty clear CNBC is used as MEdia for the Masses. The guys owning CNBC tell them to say it. So lots of retailers can buy up those sells. And opposite. Make people sell when the rich want to buy

Most people, trade for emotions. That's why crypto drew in so many retailers.

To be fair that is invalid in 2019. Remember last year? The entire hype run started in November.
And yes yes that was a bull market, this isn't.

Nah. I cared a little at peak. But said fuck it. I'm not gonna sell out for small change. I'm gonna change my life. If I lose its just a car.
Edit: 300k is more then a car. But I Wil still be working my job

Not even close. Don't compare him to mcafee
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:26:16

But yeah. I want a new life. Not same life with less debt :) go hard or go home
