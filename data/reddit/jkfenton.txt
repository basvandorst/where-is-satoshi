I really don't like bitmain, but I'm forced to buy the s9 because I don't have any options... I don't know what the hell is happening with BitFury!

4000W, that's a lot! But the miner is still profitable. Can you run this in your home?

The block size needs to grow eventually but a hard fork is a scary change. One side is proposing a soft fork to delay it a bit longer, the other side is trying to get it over with.
It will happen eventually. It's just a matter of when. It's literally like a kid not wanting to pull out a loose tooth.
It's going to come out eventually whether they want it to or not.

I don't believe that craig wright is founder of bitcoins, i dont know why but i don't believe even if he can prove that he have all document about bitcoin from beginning starting the project.
why he shown himself? is it better that he stay on the shadow of the knight? is he need famous and glamor? i just don't know
