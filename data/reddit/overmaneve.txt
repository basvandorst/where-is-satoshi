lol you don't know shit.

Not really. Not when you look at what he actually said. 
If he said the US is banning bitcoin? That's objectively false. But, to say bitcoin is a bubble can't be objectively disproven. 
Are you saying that journalists who talk about price movements and form a theory that certain stocks are overpriced are manipulating the market? Of course not. 
Context goes a long way as well given where all this was said. 
OH and let's not forget that actual positions and trading is typically the crux of market manipulation prosecutions. Good luck finding that.

False or misleading.
Everything I said stands. 
Also that order was specific enough to mention that it fell under the Act due to the futures contracts traded which is where the CFTC actually engages in enforcement actions.

The only parts of what he said that matter aren't factually incorrect.  Calling it a bubble is not factually incorrect as much as you may want it to be. 
You might feel that they're incorrect, but even truthfulness of his comments aren't the issue. Whether he actually believes it to be true matters far more.

That's the only part that actually matters. Who cares about him thinking BTC traders are dumb? That's completely irrelevant to this topic.
Why would your original comment matter if it wasn't related to the only statements of his that were material? Idgi

Ya. Show me that reasonable reliance pal.

That isn't fraud.

It's not really a question, cftc will have jurisdiction over bitcoin futures, but that doesn't mean anything. 
Saying something that drives a price down, in An of itself, isn't manipulation. 
Financial laws also don't trump his 1st amendment right, so good luck prosecuting that. 
Edit: Maybe I should make it clear that saying your opinion on shit that isn't clearly false or misleading isn't illegal. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:53:11
Yes really. Show me where the fucking duty is.
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:39:11
They're not his investors. He has zero duty to randoms.
lol.

They don't trade bitcoin. Acting as a broker for clients seeking BTC exposure through an ETN isn't the same thing.
Further, you'd need to develop an actual benefit on his part. Him shit talking BTC cause he doesn't like it and would like to see the price drop alone isn't even enough. Typically, there would have to have been a position that was improved due to his comments in the EU and that's where this is based. 
Also it's not even illegal market manipulation of what he's saying is true or just opinion.
