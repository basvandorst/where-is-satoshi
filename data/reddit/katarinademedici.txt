True,   
 People are ofret too subjective and blaim only player, but you have to see whole picture. As it is said "Don't hate the player, hate the game".   
 Genesis Mining is the safest player on the mining market and the game changes almost every day. Your paymants will depend on a lot of diferent things but as far as I am concearn, Genesis stayed true to their custommers and offered solution in the time of crisis. So I am definitely feeling safe mining in Genesis.

I invested in Genesis a few years ago and untill now I can’t really complain. There have been ups and downs but it was due to a lot of factors, mining market status and similar. But for all this time mining I can surley say that GM is legite company wich will not take your money and dissapear.I am aware of a lot of scams and ponzi on mining market and I feel I was lucky I invested in Genesis couse I have a few contracts running and I am payed on every day basis.So good luck what ever you decide and do your own investigation before you invest.

Mining is definitelly a good idea and still is quite profitabile. Bitcoin is a little hard to mine but it definitely pays off if you are lucky enough to mine it and sell it for a large amount of money.And of course, choseing a right and legite mining company is cruical. I see people take risk and mine in some unknown mining companies and it turns out to be a scam. I had luck and I have chosen Genesis when I first started mining. They are legit and i haven't had any problems with them for all this time I am mining there.So definitely, a lot of stuff is affecting mining proces, but there are some things you need to chose or do right to even start mining ( choseing cryptocurrency and mining company, how much do you invest, ellectricity costs and etc...)
