Can someone please explain how to move bitcoin from coinbase to a hardware wallet??
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:57:10
Don't think with emotions. You want it to go to 15k, but i think a panic sale is inbound as it gets below 10k. Buy the dip and hodl on brethren.

Stop investing. NOW. Save your money until you have at least 3 months of salary in the bank. You never know how your employment may change and you should be able to support your family no matter what. BTC is taking a dive, pull out and reenter once it stabilizes.

I like my pinkies, but its trending downwards. Hoping to buy in around 10k
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:07:23
And then it rose 50%...
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:06:22
On coinbase :/
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:37:45
Yet every one of your posts are on bitcoins subreddit. Get a life, troll.
@_date: 2019-03-28 00:47:15
what's your electric bill like?
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:46:03
you must be one of the doubters
@_date: 2018-11-19 00:12:16
just like gold did.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:41:55
Lol whatever you say bud, bought a fresh new bitcoin while it was down. Check back with me in a month.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:36:49
You're in for a rude awakening. 100k will be passed within the year my dude.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:50:05
I'm posting this so in a year I can talk some serious shit
@_date: 2018-07-23 15:47:35
I believe it, considering how few of people you've probably seen. And I dont remember ever losing any argument with you, I only remember you declaring you will eat your shoe if bitcoin hits 20k again. When you're done masturbating to anime, check out the price of BTC. Hope you got small feet.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:20:02
What were you saying about it not even being at 8k?
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:29:25
Ugh.. Take my upvote 
@_date: 2018-07-23 15:30:34
Yes, I sifted through your numerous posts about that anime game you are weirdly obsessed with, and I chose not to call you out for your excessive interest in the character romances, but rather, how you confess your anxiety over changes made to your favorite character. Funny how you can call me a moron for stating my opinion, but cry victim when the shaming comes your way. Real world must be so cruel to you.
@_date: 2018-07-28 15:36:46
220k for an auto shop doesnt seem expensive to me..
@_date: 2018-07-23 15:37:33
So the you're way to deal with anxiety is to troll others? Take it out on the octopussy. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 10:34:50
Stick to octopath traveller lol 
I think you're done here too.
@_date: 2018-07-23 04:57:51
You sound like a juvenile, so I'll break it down for you. I absolutely would sell at 95k. If I make the prediction that the value of bitcoin caps at 100k, and it does so, I may be losing a potential 5k, but it is very likely for there to be a point below 95k where I can buy MORE bitcoin for a cheaper rate... Why the fuck wouldn't I sell just below my estimated peak? Get off the internet if it makes you so butt hurt, dumbass.
@_date: 2018-07-16 23:20:14
Sculptors make sculptures.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:06:35
What are the rules on reporting capital losses? Am I entitled to tax deductions if I lost money on my cryptocurrency investments?
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:17:07
What do you just lurk around r/BTC looking for people to troll? Don't be mad you're too broke to buy in lmao
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:50:37
I guess your knowledge of photovoltaics is just vastly superior to mine. Sorry for implying my career makes an impact.. But look man, I can see your anime game is a sensitive subject, and I'm sorry for bringing it up. You are totally not a loser for your infatuation with fictional romances, and you're absolutely entitled to your own misguided opinions on bitcoin. Thanks for the comedy, it's been real.
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:42:15
Never insulted your choice in games, just your obsession with them. And for someone who was "done with me" you seem to be struggling to forget about me. But since you're interested I'll tell you about myself. I work in the solar trade, saving the world one house at a time. I go to school for electrical engineering, which I pay for out of pocket. I invest in industries which I believe will better the world. And I whoop as in every game I play.

BCH was formed by the core of the Bitcoin population. The people who saw the true purpose of cryptocurrency and wanted to separate from the get rich quick people. These bitcoiners who talk down on BCH don't understand the technology and are welcome to remain invested the volatile market that they know nothing about.
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:02:20
Pointless negativity. Downvoted.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:58:56
Right back at ya ������
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:27:44
I expect the come up to take about as long as the dip. we'll likely see the bear market slow down, and by April 2019 start to see the bulls return. Jan 2020 expect a new ATH. Til then, keep calm and hodl on.
