No, my friend is the original poster. I'm the person the letter was sent to. I posted it on my Facebook and told him he could post it on reddit. Well I guess that kind of makes me the op. OPP? Yeah, you know, me.

Wow, it only took 4 days for another letter to surface. I am very relieved that this has been sent out to at least one other human being.

My friend was the op on that and he took it down for fear of it harming my job/business. I am the recipient of the original letter. GM of Pizza Pirates. I don't mind the image being up. I told him that. I've linked my original Facebook post and a picture of the envelope too somewhere in this mess.

It isn't fake. I mean the threat is probably fake, but I really did get this letter.

My name is Sandra and I'm the GM of Pizza Pirates in Pomona. The place that was spam extorted. My friend, the OP, took it down because he thought it would hurt my job/business in some way. All I have to say after reading through these comments is I love you all. Please feel free to come to my store and actually get a pie first THEN leave us awesome feedback :) and so everyone knows, we never took it serious and the lot of you are fucking brilliant and terrify me. That is all. 
Oh and 
That is where I had posted it first. I saved the letter and the envelope just in case.

I'm sure it's a scam. Here is my og post in case my post gets lost up there

That's ok. It's the internet, I understand. Unless, like someone mentioned before, we were personally targeted, which I HIGHLY doubt, I suspect a few more businesses will start posting these. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 09:04:40
I like you too. Let's make out. If you read my OPP (yeah you know me) I had kind of made a joke about it being someone that knew me. You know, the whole terrorism thing since I'm an Arab.

Here is a picture of the envelope. 
EGAL DOCUMENT 
I'm still laughing.

The officer I spoke to said this was very serious and we needed to file a report ASAP when the owner was here. We just wanted to see if any other businesses in the country had received the letter as well before we called to file the actual report. It would make us feel a whole lot better if it was just mass produced spam hoping to scare a few people into paying. The mailman dropped this off on Monday and not a single other human being has posted about getting one other than me.

My pizzas ARE the bomb. Being that I also happen to be arabic, I'm probably on some NSA watch list for saying bomb/terrorist/meth/pizza. Thanks reddit. And yes, I am the extortee. Is that even a word? Fuckit. It is now.
@_date: 2014-06-18 07:05:20
It was mailed to us! The cameras would be pointless. I already know what our mailman looks like. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 02:21:21
Have I been redeemed? Few others surfaced today too. Seems that our mail is just faster than the rest of the countries. As the latest comment stated, they are targeting pizza places. Fuck them for trying to threaten small businesses with this bullshit. Fake tough guy act. They don't know what tough is. I've nursed two teething babies with razor sharp teeth and lived to tell the tale with mammary glands in tact. They ain't shit.
