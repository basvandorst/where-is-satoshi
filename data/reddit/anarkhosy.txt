He was making a silly joke I think

Maybe I'm stubborn... but I think we're not seeing the whole picture here.  It could be that sending the newly received stealthy payment to a non-stealth address provides a way to link all the transactions into a chain. In other words, payments sent into the "stealth address" system are laundered/anon, but once you send btc to a non stealth address you're giving away all the previous information.  The ZeroCoin system is being designed to avoid this problem.  Of course, I don't know enough about what is really going on here, just being stubborn I guess.
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:42:57
I wondered just a moment ago, what happens when your newly received btc at your stealth address is sent from your regular address to another regular address.  Wouldn't this reveal the information of the previous blockchain transactions, including stealth transactions?  I'm having a hard time understanding how this could not be so.

Isn't that bug just useful for denial of services attacks anyway?  In other words, not used to *steal* btc

Do you have evidence that is how Mt. Gox is built?  I understand what you are saying of course, I just wonder if they would allow a double send to occur without some kind of manual approval.  Since you can have millions of usd worth of btc sent in a single transaction, I just don't quite buy that Mt. Gox would even allow for such a thing to occur automatically.  (*Of course I'm just a 'layman', I'm just using a gut feeling here.*)

Volume isn't the same as supply, as the same coins are often resold in the same day.  Volume is interesting, of course... But liquidity/supply increases a few percent this does affect price a lot, even if the supply is a much smaller fraction of volume.

If Somalia didn't seem so xenophobic against non-Muslims, I could be persuaded to live there for a time.  I've read great things about Puntland and Somaliland.

It sounds to me that there aren't glaring issues that would make Bitcoin outdated in a couple years because of a competitor.
@_date: 2011-12-31 00:38:31
Not based on something finite, like a commodity.
@_date: 2011-10-15 05:28:40
Very interesting, thank you.  If you have time, can you point me to papers discussing these two factions?  The idea that Austrianism has two distinct faction that may end up debating is interesting to me.
@_date: 2011-10-13 20:37:40
Another question for you, if you you wouldn't mind please, would paying for large expenses, such as apartment rent, save anyone money on taxes?  I read [here]( about a foreign luxury apartment complex accepting bitcoin for payment.
If some US apartments accepted bitcoin, would there be any tax benefit to the manager or renter?
@_date: 2011-10-21 00:08:13
Interesting.  I found more about that here: 
thank you.
@_date: 2011-10-14 20:36:01
Hmm.  Does Austrianism favor deflation over inflation, or do they instead advocate a non-changing money supply (i.e., *neither* deflation **or** inflation)?  
I have read plenty of convincing essays on the merits of delation on mises.org, but I've already read plenty of essays advocating the return of a gold-backed currency.  If people used a currency backed by gold, there probably (*I believe*) would **not** be much deflation or inflation.  
I had assumed a relatively static money supply (*essentially growing by how fast people can mine gold, which is actually very slow*) was what Austrians favor, as opposed to a currency which consistently has small amounts of deflation.  You thoughts?
@_date: 2011-12-31 01:22:53


What if the number crunch was on something finite ... but sortof useful as well.  Take for instance, a genome.  Let's say that mapping a genome of some animal or plant and saving a gene as a bitcoin-like block.  Then the block could be traded ...  
... Or, [analyzing photos of a planet](  Or something else...
@_date: 2011-12-30 21:48:23
Well if bitcoin 2.0 is released, its possible that bitcoin 1.0 will be discarded.
Then again, I doubt that's how it would work.  I imagine bitcoin protocols can be updated without scrapping the previous bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-10-21 22:52:14
Just so I understand the tail part of this discussion...  tossout12 mentioned this:


That is very interesting to me.  I never thought that a **truly anonymous** cryptocurrency can never be **completely trustworthy**.  Is this an absolute fact?  Is it really completely mathematically impossible to eliminate fraud and provide absolute anonymity?
Thank again all, this is fantastic information.
@_date: 2011-10-13 20:30:23
Well, I am an employee and I'd be willing to accept bitcoin if it would help me reduce taxes.  But it seems like it would not, sadly.
@_date: 2011-10-13 20:32:43


Is that applicable in all countries?  For instance, are people being paid in, say, gold or silver in any country and avoiding income taxes?  Or is what you say universal to all countries?
@_date: 2011-12-30 23:03:45
At this point I think its fair to say that 'fiat' has another meaning.
@_date: 2011-10-28 00:28:25
I'm also confused by the article.  Does it suggest that the US government is able to sniff all tcp/ip packets and block bitcoin transactions?  What am I missing here?
Certainly, the US can block domains from known bitcoin sellers.  They could kill off  (I mean the domain name that is registered.)  That would slow things down.  People would be forced to use ip-addresses directly, similar to Wikileaks.
And they could treat bitcoin sellers as a type of money launderer and arrest the people behind the large ones.  But would that stop small time, Craigslist-style sales with people using something like Tor?  I have my doubts.
@_date: 2011-10-15 06:40:03
Thank you, that is enough to get me started.
@_date: 2011-12-30 21:45:48
I wish that some aspect of tangible asset is connected to bitcoin.  But maybe that defeats the purpose of ecurrency.
I am wary of fiat money, although I understand bitcoin is finite and therefore is not fiat.  On the other hand, I define money as something I can hold in my hand.  So an ecurrency doesn't quite compute in my brain.
@_date: 2011-10-13 20:55:38
Thank you.

Well, those aren't decentralized.

I'm pretty sure he's being sarcastic.

If you live in an apartment, buy a place to live first.  Even a simple RV or down payment on a mobile home.  No investment can come close to the payoff that saving on your rent will give you each month.

I like what I see there.  I'll email them about how I can implement them on BigCommerce.
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:27:42
Its interesting, like an Amazon or eBay.  But at this point I just want to add another way to accept funds for my products on *my* site.  My site has links to other things, such as Facebook and Pinterest.  I don't want them to leave my dot-com.
@_date: 2013-02-22 10:30:56
Wow... this system seems incredible.  It seems to compete with Western Union and Bank Wire Transfers, which are pricey.  


This is amazing if it is truly that cheap to any nation.  If this is legal, this will be great.  It seems to be a reliable system for business... although I say that without knowing how to pull down USD and EUR from the system on the receiving end.
If anything this is competition for Dwolla.  I like Dwolla, but they don't allow sending cash overseas.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:39:11
I would be delighted!

Leaving out steps.  For instance, converting bitcoin to USD and CNY in China.  Also, many people have never heard of bitcoin, so...

Bingo.  Renting is flushing money down the toilet.  Trailers/mobile homes allow you to keep much more of your equity.  As you get older and save up, you can then move into a small condominium or detached home.
For example, let's assume a mobile home allows you to save half on your rental costs (*you recoup them when you sell it*).  If your rental costs are $800/month, then over the course of one year owning a mobile home can save you $400 x 12 = $4800.  Over the course of 3 years (*you should be out of this home by now and into a condo*) you will have saved $14,400.  Besides investing right at the bottom of a bubble and selling exactly at the top, there is no asset investment/speculation/trade that will benefit you more than saving on your greatest expense in life.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:42:11
Hmm.  About the private key.  You could use a phrase, peppered with some unique 'salt', to make it easy to recall.  For instance a favorite verse of the Bible; concatenated with a short password to prevent book-phrase bots from brute forcing your wallet open.

Get Aliexpress/Alibaba to support bitcoin, and we're golden.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:45:43
Wow, great point.  I wonder if TrueCrypt hidden encrytion scheme might apply here.  They allow a hidden partition on a hard drive, so that one can claim [plausible deniability](  In order words, you can claim the wallet *doesn't even exist*.
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:26:38
I've tried the Mt. Gox payment button, but its very lacking.  For instance it doesn't redirect back to the store (*like PayPal does*) to complete the sale.
I suppose I'd prefer to show a bitcoin address with the message "send payment to this address so we can fulfill your order" instead of having them sign into their Mt. Gox account inside a popup.  
@_date: 2013-01-27 10:10:05
Hard to say.  I actually do have a HSBC-US bank account.  And it is completely different than the HSBC-HK bank.  To transfer between them I need to do a wire transfer I've been told, which is why I'm trying to figure out a cheaper way.
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:34:09
Mt. Gox has a merchant tool which instantly converts btc into usd for you, so that the price fluctuations don't hurt you.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to incorporate this into BC.
@_date: 2013-01-27 09:53:15
Fly there, show up at the bank with your passport.  I haven't done it yet, but HSBC is very easy from what I've been reading.

These modern storefronts have APIs so developers can create their own payment gateways (*I think*).  I'm not sure that Volusion (*or BigCommerce*) would even *need* to be in the loop if all one was doing was creating an app.
@_date: 2013-01-26 04:59:44
Do you have any kind of site that has a feedback rating?  For instance, I see some TaoBao export agents listing themselves on eBay as a way to have feedback.

I had this in mind.  I was thinking specifically of Bible verses; only I was imagining a 'salt' added to the key to make it unique.  For instance:

One way we can tell is a week after the Cyprus banks open if the price hasn't crashed it wasn't all due to Cyprus.

It would help bitcoin do well.  Watching the USD self-destruct creates more interest in alternative currencies.
@_date: 2013-02-22 10:22:14
bitcoin needs to be bigger.  Some people will want to move $100+ million at a time, bitcoin is too small for that.  If it was 10+ times as large in total value, then I'd agree.
@_date: 2013-10-01 00:38:10
I wasn't able to implement this on my bigcommerce store.
@_date: 2013-02-22 19:15:06
That is extremely helpful.  Thank you very much.
@_date: 2013-01-26 05:03:34
Well, what I'm looking for is a way that I can send money, and the receiver converts it immediately into USD or CNY.  The receiver wouldn't want to hang onto the bitcoin.
I know there are issues of bid/ask where the exchange rate fluctuates quite a bit.  I suppose I'm looking for a method that reduces the bid/ask variable so that the conversion to USD or CNY is very reliable in terms of fees paid.
Many people have never heard of bitcoin.  So I'd need a very small howto.  I might be sending cash for $100, or for $5000, so I suppose I'd like to know if I should use WU for small payments and bitcoin for large payments.
