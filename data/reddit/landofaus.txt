I'm a chiropractor.
Mostly I just get people out of pain, correct the underlying issues that may have caused that problem, and help them maintain the work they have done in my office.  I also do free lifestyle talks discussing healthy eating, some supplementation, posture, stress relief, and other topics.
At the moment I live in Australia, but eventually I will be moving back to the US where my profession, which once performed well, is slowly being eviscerated by the government and insurance industries.  When I return, I'd like to open a practice that bypasses much of the garbage that entrenching yourself in the US health care system mixes you up in.  
Also, I'm trying to, in a way, carve a new path that other chiropractors might be able to follow to help them escape the absolute mess that the industry has become.
Bitcoin is one of the aspects of business that I'd very seriously like to consider.  However, it's still very new to me and I have an enormously difficult time speaking the language of Bitcoin and getting clear on what's currently possible and what's not.

Hi There Gavin.
I'm a well educated, health care professional.  I do not know computers nearly as well as most people excited about Bitcoin, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm really excited about Bitcoin.
My question (however late) is, What can I do to help?
I'm good at persuasive writing, forming solid arguments, and public speaking.  I just want to do more besides buy, trade, and talk about it on Reddit.
This is a serious offer.  I'll literally write or speak on anything the community needs...all I need is some general guidance.  
I'm happy to help and I'll do it for free.  Where can I contribute my time?

So, if I take a picture with a normal digital camera, should I have any problems with my information being in the .jpg file?
Also, how do I put a watermark on a picture?

I do speaking engagements with small groups on a weekly basis (about health care).  I do the occasional public talk in medium sized groups. I used to do YouTube videos, but I had a hell of a time coming up with content.  Switching to talking about Bitcoin sometimes might be an interesting change...I'll give that some thought.
I really love the idea of a Bitcoin health care business, or at least accepting Bitcoin as medium of exchange for care in addition to dollars.  Not sure if I will be living in the right place for that though as I tend to stick to small to medium sized towns to practice in.
Anyway, thanks for the response.

OP, Do you have any idea or suspicion they the account was frozen? Do you think it was just for using localbitcoins.com? What kind of transfers were you doing there? I'm considering buying BTC by bank transfer but your post made me nervous.

How do I select the saved wallet when opening electrum?

Ok, by some strange miracle, I did another "Repair Wallet" after updating the software and the funds magically appeared.  However, I did promise payment and I feel bad that none of this advice got used, so to remedy this, I'd like to donate 20% (+ or - $90 USD) to a good cause as chosen by you guys.
Please reply to this comment for suggestions and I will then post proof of the transaction after it takes place.

First the official response to you:
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:31:39
Ok.  You got here first with this advice.
I have downloaded electrum.
How do I now find the wallet using electrum?
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:27:50
I'm big into 2FA.  
So, how (exactly) do I store funds in cold storage, like on a couple or three jump drives?  Do I create new wallets in Electrum and transfer BTC to there, then move the wallet?  If so, how do I actually move the wallet itself?   
How does all of that work?

Donation made.  Thanks!

Now, I'd like to ask you a question just as general advice.
I use CoinBase for buying and selling.  Is this a good practice or do you recommend also using Electrum to store funds or for any other reason?  What's the consensus these days on online servers vs local wallet apps?
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:34:53

Ok....I solved the problem.  I will post details as to what happened in a few min.
