I feel ya. I used to love purse but the this last transaction has been bad. I can't for the life of me get the guy who purchased for me to respond to any kind of communication. Granted I only bought an $80 board game but I think foul play is an issue on thus one.

Lol that's probably all me. I've been researching it like a mad man. I need a hobby to throw some cash at.

Lol right? 
Good thing is I have solar in arizona so during the day electric is basically free.
I set up a raspberry pi with cgminer and I have 4 antminer u3 coming to hook up. 
I'd love to get my hands on an s7 unfortunately they are priced a little steep atm.

Hundreds of transaction and one known incident. I'll take my chances. Be sides I have proof on my purse account. There is nothing illegal about the site. You can get into no trouble legally from using it. You sound like a hypochondriac (worried about a statistically low chance of something bad happening)

I doubt it. I use all my amazon gift card on there to buy bitcoins. To be completely honest I don't even really look at the exchange rate. If I have a $25 card I look for a $25 order. The Gift cards were free anyways.

Well I guess maybe I'll look into peercoin or some other compatible coin. I'd like to do it for the expierence and just not loose a ton of cash I guess.

Thanks. I really don't know much about the whole bitcoin thing. I'm reading up and it definitely sounds interesting.
