That have a bank account in Poland for SEPA transfers. So should take one day 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:28:28
Exactly. The fact that they were saying everything was okay and allowing people to carry on depositing into their mtgox accounts while this was happening has shown them to be criminal and malicious. Had the whole thing come to a halt once they discovered theft/loss of coins etc rather than allowing more people to get involved they would have been just incompetent rather than actively malicious.

Apart from them laughing at the end 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:21:35
I think bailout is the wrong word here. It's a case of retrieving lost coins that already exist and are rightfully owned by mtgox and their account holders. It's nothing like the bank bailouts where money was taken from the tax payer and given to private institutions.

Because presumably if he is able to be prosecuted in any country it will be the country where he/mtgox were located, Japan. Also he will be fearing for his life, why make it easy for people to find him by staying in the country where his location is currently known.

Why 6 hours?

How much did you pay for those 65btc though? Were you an early adopter or was that your life savings?

If I had both BTC and EUR balances in my account would I have two separate entries in the spreadsheet both with the same User ID?
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:28:40
When I look at my status it says I have a "standard account". Does this mean I am verified? I created my account quite a while ago and can't remember if I did anything to get verified or not.

I'm getting error 522? What am I missing out on?

Nice try hacker

FFS give it a few more weeks/months until everything has come out and we can see the full picture. He may well be a criminal but we still don't have enough information to make that judgement.
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:51:12
Thanks, I hadn't seen any of the other posts explaining this. Thank you for your informative reply rather than being rude just because I hadn't seen the other posts.

Which IRC channel is MT in?

He has claimed that he thought she was talking about a Government project that he used to be working on with that quote.
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:52:55
I'm considering buying some BTC on mt.gox now while the price is low. Being under a legal jurisdiction such as Japan it's highly unlikely they will try to keep everyone's BTC indefinitely right? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:44:25
Source about three companies bidding?

An autistic computer nerd like Mark will get torn to shreds in prison. Shame it will only be a Japanese prison.

How is it good? How is any news that means innocent users might never get their money/BTC back good?

Yes it happened to me too. Of course I instantly assumed my wallet had been compromised by the Chinese but nothing untoward appears to have occurred.

I've been hoping that the internet will destroy estate agents too. Unfortunately this hasn't happened yet.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:42:15
Probably because people were doing day to day trading of such large amounts

There are just as many blackhat hackers who would sell your identity for $50 as there are whitehat hackers as these guys potentially are.

I thought they had moved office and no one knew where they were?
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:19:51
I think so. No normal person would keep talking about his cat sitting on his keyboard when trying to have a serious conversation about very serious events.

No it's more like when a sports team goes bankrupt so the fans buy it out and run it themselves.

You shouldn't have bought to speculate on its value. You are part of the problem 
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:31:16
Good to hear, thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:42:36
This is the biggest problem with bitcoin at the moment and why potentially it is still in a big bubble. The majority of people are buying into bitcoin as a speculative investment rather than to use as an everyday alternative currency. When we see uptake by large retailers accepting bitcoin (amazon, eBay etc) we will be in the clear.

In mtgox's case it's a fat man
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:25:07
If it had the lowest fees then yes 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:30:36
Because that's where he lives
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:40:49
Mark will

From European bank accounts it only takes a day to transfer to Mtgox's Polish account
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:02:28
Well I sent mine earlier this week and it arrived the next day. From a UK bank account but in Euros as a SEPA transfer. You put your account reference number in as the message?
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:40:39
I entrusted £200 of my own money and £200 of my girlfriend's money to said French fat man. Hopefully she won't leave me now. I have been goxed.

Don't be fooled by this anti libertarian hack. He hates the idea of a free market and also is happy to pander to Islamic fascism in order to get votes.

This looks promising but going through the process of doing a bank transfer and it is starting to ask me for the various log in details for my online banking!? I'm going to take alot of persuading before I do this.

I've been trying Pingit as it looks like the most convenient and safest way to fund blockchain. Problem is my Android phone is rooted meaning the Pingit app refuses to let me set up an account. Having to unroot my phone just for the sake of one app is a completely needless hassle which I shall never forgive Barclays for but may be what I'll end up doing.
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:49:16
This is 5 minutes drive from me. Will definitely be going there to buy some pick and mix with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-28 21:58:40
Nice. Where is the location?

@_date: 2013-04-28 17:10:29
They updated it again soon after and now it works
@_date: 2013-01-10 22:05:16
This is interesting you have said this as the one reason stopping me from 'speculating' in bitcoins is the fact that alot of people appear to be doing so and I worry there is a bubble forming. i.e more people are just holding bitcoins rather than people who are using it as a genuine currency for transactions of goods or services.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:12:56
It was but they updated it again soon after the first update and now paring is working, well it did for me at least.
