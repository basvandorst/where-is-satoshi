in satoshi's orignal paper he wrote of a way to compress a block down to the header because of the merkel tree you can get rid of transactions without invalidating the hash by geting rid of branches and leaving there hash so you could compact a block to 80 bytes plus to extra hashes this will also speed up download and verifcation becuase less hashes

well adding a node id to a transaction could work you would have to make it tamper proof so maybe we reward for first node to propergate the block then the node signs the block and add's it to the chain and the public key would be the address to send the btc's to

A friend of mine is working on a more secure version of smart-contracts he calls it snark contracts it is a way of running any app of block-chain and paying the server running the app for you if all the requirements a met:
   1) the code was not altered in any way
   2) the code was accepted (return 0;)

price is not interesting. innovation is. i normally check the price myself but when coding or writing a block chain apps i don't check because it distracts me so much its NOT IMPORTANT the media is obsessed with it (usually) its because mainstream users and media only care about MONEY MAKING and price is all the banks understand.

could help scale bitcoin a bit because an opendime is of chain after you load it with bitcoin and because you know others will accept it. you wouldn't open it and just keep them for later to spend with other shops.
