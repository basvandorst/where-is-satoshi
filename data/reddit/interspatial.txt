It's ok, he's a naruto-runner.

That's not what happened.  They were in a long position.  This means that they took out contracts on margin believing that the price was going up.  The price moved against them, against their margin requirement and therefore the trade was force-sold (liquidated).  This person did not have the intention of selling, it was absolutely the opposite.

$20k in trades is nothing.  Like, honestly.  Let's say you have .5 BTC, which is a decent amount, about $5,000.  You sell it at $6,000, buy it back at $5,000 and then sell it again at $9,000.  $20k in volume right there.  That's minutes for some.

To be fair, it Satoshi Nakamoto called it "electronic cash" in the whitepaper.  The store of value argument came later once transaction costs rose to a level that made it a bad choice to be used like a traditional currency. 
Here's the whitepaper:

I CPU mine XMR on my Threadripper 1950X.

For this particular setup: I am running a full node and solo mining blocks.  It is likely that I will never hit a block and the calculated time to find a block is around 2 years.  I'm not looking to ROI on this rig, just running a full node to support the network.  I love the concept and community of Monero and I'm ok with contributing this way.  Finding a block would be a lot of fun, but I'm not counting on it.  I have a Vega 2 on the same rig that I pool mine.  I have 3 other rigs (RX580s, RX Vegas) that I pool mine XMR on and they are slightly profitable at the moment, but it's likely I'll never ROI on those either.  I used to mine ETH and sold all my hardware before the prices went very low (lots of GTX1060s).  I missed mining so much as a hobby that I repurchased a set of hardware that is more suited to mining the cryptonote algorithm.

Ethereum and its smart contracts would make sense here.

They make money on a larger spread.  "No fee" is misleading.

Exactly.  Real world use for everyday payments without banking is what got me excited about Bitcoin in the first place.

Why?  Do you hate adoption?  There are obviously better ways to purchase Bitcoin, but using these is far superior to being a no-coiner!
