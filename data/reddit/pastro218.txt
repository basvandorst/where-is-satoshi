Report says he paid her. Can't imagine she came forward herself. Underage prostitution isn't exactly something to brag about...

Lightning is just the current banking system put on top of a blockchain. Central nodes run by trusted parties? Sounds like a bank to me.
I get that there needs to be layer 2 protocols, I just don't buy that lightning is the answer. Especially when I see Samson mow act like a conceited little fuck while not justifying it.

Can't get that cash in your bank account after though.

Lightning nodes have the ability to not include transactions... that is absolutely power over your money.

No KYC? In the middle East? No disrespect, but isn't the whole point of KYC to prevent easy cash flow to terrorists? And isn't the middle East a bit of a hot area for terrorism?

I've been around almost all of the middle east, bar Iran and Iraq, as my partners parents have lived in Oman for the last 6 years. He works for a defence contractor, who are helping the Omani sultanate establish a credible air force, and is privy to threat assessments from both the Omani government and also the western counter parts.
Some regions always made for bleak reading, and were deemed to be unsafe for westerners.
I am in no means implying that everyone is a terrorist, as many of the Arabs I've met are considerably friendlier than the average western person I meet, but there are most definitely some places I would fight hard not to go to.

Eh? Arguably more secure. The rest is up for debate...

You’re all worried about privacy, because the NSA is hacking everything and watching everything, and you think the government can’t do IT?

Love how people act like these guys aren’t playing on a completely different level, with state cyber warfare already a thing?

Erm. Less chance I am using a private key for that signature!!

Weird that you’d gamble on Bitcoin and not some stupid options play at earnings.

Bitcoin ETF = NO
Bitcoin Futures = Green light buddy!!
They knew the market was relatively illiquid and that the amount of money needed to manipulate it in one direction or another was child’s play for the kinds of institutions they really represent. All this talk of believers market and what not is bollocks. The institutions saw an opportunity to make a shedload of cash quickly and the spineless whores in the CFTC and SEC enabled them. And who really gets burnt by this? You and I, because they “popped the bubble”. How did they do that? By letting whales in with the minnows.

Can someone ELI5 for me please? I don’t follow the logic that some people are trotting out here.
