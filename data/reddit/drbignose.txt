When the banking situation gets normal again they can use...their bank. Why would they want to be sitting on bitcoins they can't use in the meantime. You don't make any sense. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:29:01
Bitcoiners would never do such a thing. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:23:33
You are 100% correct. And even your downvoters know this. They just don't want to accept it. Because this time it just HAS to be different and not like the previous 50 pump and dumps. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:07:10
Because of the Bitcoin system. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:39:58
No they aren't. Please stop posting this bs. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:27:13
About what?
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:41:59
Mainstream adoption any day now. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:25:43
No they aren't. Please stop posting this nonsense every 30 minutes. The original post is still on the mainpage. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:03:00
Like Paypal you mean?
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:40:42
Please don't tell me anyone here is suprised that this is just a pump and dump done by traders. Greece isn't buying or selling coins. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:09:18
Sure. And marketing is fine but let's stop pretending Greece is going crazy over Bitcoin. That's the part that bothers me. Not their marketing. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:10:49
Or you know....paypal. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:40:56
The Greeks aren't fleeing to Bitcoin. It's complete nonsense. 
And the rest of Europe isn't either. We had like a 15 dollar price rise. 2 traders could have caused that. If "europe" was really buying we would be up 100+ now. Instead we're going down because the expected dumping by traders is already happening. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:25:27
The only working alternative?
And Paypal or the tons of other online payment systems? Or the 100's of alt coins? 
Edit: downvoted because? 
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:04:07
Because you are gambling with his money. He needs new buyers so his coins go up in price. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:07:06
No. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:45:11
What news?
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:36:26
I highly doubt this is the case. Merchants all over the place have been dropping Bitcoin this year. There is no reason for a sudden jump in adoption again. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:49:37
And your Bitcoin wallet magically fills up itself. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:56:02
No no, please explain it to me. How do those coins get in your wallet? I can't wait for your answer. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:49:13
Yes i know. It's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:18:37
No you didn't answer. But that's ok. We both know why. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:29:53
You ruined his day. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:47:41
Of course it isn't. It's so obvious i don't see how we need an article to tell us. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:07:47
Hilarious. Just stop man. It's getting silly. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:41:42
Stress test.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:15:21
Obviously. 
Greece is buying Bitcoin like crazy! 79% more!!
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:06:11
Sure, that is the real reason. 
And not because the real numbers would show that the Greek buyers went up from 5 to 15. 
As you can see on the charts Greece is buying like crazy.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:10:12
Thanks. 
I can't wait for your answer. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:08:34
How this complete nonsense is upvoted 5 times is beyond me. 
Your view of society and economics is that of an 8 year old. Quite amazing the way you people think. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:23:23
How euphoric are you in this moment?
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:40:02
A 7 year old could predict a market crash in this case. 
So far there hasn't been a Bitcoin rally but even that is easily predictable as traders always jump on situations like this. 
He really didn't predict anything special. I find it surprising that you are impressed by this. 
Here let me impress you. 
If Spain defaults there will be a market crash and Bitcoin will go up a bit. 
Please post about me if Spain goes to shit. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:54:21
What does it tell you that none of these companies give out any real numbers and that the price is going down?
Does that suggest Greece isn't buying and these articles are full of shit or that Greece is buying like crazy?
I know you are emotionally and financially invested but for the first times in days try to think clearly and think about the answer. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:43:28
5 seconds?
