Anyways this seems like a pointless argument. In no way is that feasible anyways, or even so - worth the effort

Okay but then she didn’t actually spend any gold, she spent paper money. Unless the ATM clipped off 7$ worth of gold from her bar it doesn’t mean much. So ultimately she could just print out endless money because she’s associating it to her gold while her gold remains the same size?

I don’t think you understand how the market works. If you did buy so much bitcoin it would be worthless.

That’s not his avatar it’s an image he posted with the thread. There may not be anything special from his prediction but he’s already 3/3. It actually is quite interesting to see how this will play out.

Can anyone explain what exactly he’s even doing?

The video was honestly a great watch, I didn’t think I’d watch the whole thing but it was very engaging. 
The video makes a ton of good points and makes me excited about the future it holds. 
Banks are clearly scared and will undoubtedly lose a lot of power in the upcoming decades. I’m not talking just about crypto currencies here but financial technology in general is a big threat. With different fintech companies taking a small chunks of their business little by little it won’t be too long before they have to innovate to stay competitive. Their current tactics are pathetic, just spreading FUD, creating their own crypto for all the wrong reasons and funding people to rally against it. 
Cryptocurrency itself is a big threat and what makes it scarier to them is the new generation, people who grew up with technology and embrace it rather than just dismiss it because they don’t understand it. That’s pretty much the most important takeaway from this video. The fact that most millennials are already invested in bitcoin says a lot about the future. They are the ones who decides what will be the next big thing, like it or not.

Because the price is also its worth. This isn’t just about crypto currencies it’s legit about every single currency ever.
