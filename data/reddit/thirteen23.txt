I'm just not seeing why you think either is more detestable than the other in it's own right? From what I can see it seems as if you are basing these conclusions on a small group of users that you have personally witnessed instead of the drug as a whole.

Where did OP say it was good or bad?
Caffeine is mind altering and highly addictive, marijuana is mind altering and not physiologically addictive (or extremely minimal depending on study). Read a book once in a while. Such ignorance. 


lol, I didn't say that. That's your thing.

No. You made that up. 
Keep using your highly addictive brain altering substances known as caffeine and sugar though....feeble mind gonna feeble mind.

There's no "worse" or no better. I see them both as beneficial depending on use. I also see negatives of both depending on use. Caffeine is proven more physically harmful and addictive. Caffeine has caused death, marijuana has no reported cases of death in all of history. Caffeine withdrawal effects border on intense depending on use, marijuana withdrawal is mild even for heavy users. My point stands that it's hypocritical to bash one drug while supporting another. Hope I've helped.

That's why I presented you with facts of both drugs.

Speaking of obnoxious...

I see now. More like a grocery stores club card. It's a great gimmick to get people to keep shopping there and could easily be implemented into their system once they take bitcoin. Just remember there's always a trade off. But as far as merchants go, if it's working for them aready, there's no need to stop when you accept bitcoin and if your model is just low prices without the gimmick, then that will stay the same also.

Problem is, this isn't a thread asking opinions on drug use. That makes it obnoxious. Don't like it, don't parade around your opinions. Btw, I bet you've used caffeine and sugar, that's about where I put marijuana in the spectrum of things, so stop being a hypocrite. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:34:54
Doesn't mean you need to go parading your opinion everywhere when it's not asked for. Comes off as attention seeking and agenda pushing. I don't like everything either, but I don't spend my time seeking out places to express my distaste.

Merchants are able to offer 2-3% discounts or cash back if they choose to and maintain the same margins as if someone were paying with a credit card. Beyond that, you are basically asking for bitcoin payment processors to charge larger fees to the merchant in order to offer rewards to the customer. Ideally bitcoin would eliminate this entirely and prices would naturally end up being a couple percentage points lower from the get go. Most rewards you earn from credit cards are an illusion because the merchant already calculates the lost percentages into their profit margin.
