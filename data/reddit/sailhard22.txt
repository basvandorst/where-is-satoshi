Put your money in the stock market, housing or crypto. Cash will slowly erode.

Based on his comments, I think the Fed is anticipating that Libra will scale and became a worldwide payments system. And it seems like they are prepared to give it their blessing after proper regulations are established.  This should be the catalyst for an upcoming flood of money into the crypto space. HODL strong.

He said that *right now* bitcoin (not alts) is a speculative store of value because it hasn’t been adopted as a payment system, which I think he is spot on about. But he admits that it could be used for transactions in the future.

Put your $1000 into BTC and in 7 months it’ll be $4700
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:01:36
No. It hasn’t experienced mass adoption yet as a payment system. That’s a fact. AND he acknowledges that it can be in the future. So your point doesn’t make any sense.

When it hits $120k. Cause thats a real bubble.

Not out of the realm of possibility but you’d need a significant catalyst to get there. The trend is a decaying curve with less volatility and longer cycles.
What would catalyst be? Recession?

We must move forwards—not backwards. Upwards—not downwards. And always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom.

Man they are not even trying anymore. You know the market is oversold when bitcoin is to blame for the opioid crisis. Im sure its also linked to autism and causes anal warts.

Hodl hodl news. Very reputable. I loved their coverage of the Iran nuclear deal.

In my experience, Bitcoinist is a fair and balanced news website. I remember their coverage of the Catholic Church scandal set the standard for investigative journalism.
