because I didn't judge a book by it's cover? or because I'm willing to read dissenting opinions to my own?

Finally, someone level headed.
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:03:34
You’re critiquing his argument without even having read the book?
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:05:57
\&gt;Did you come here thinking people would buy this book before posting back?
No no, of course not.  I was just passing along a recommendation.
\&gt; You didnt even provide a review, for all I know you didnt read it either.
Given you aren't the first person to say this, I think I might actually make a post on my blog reviewing this book since so many have asked.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:04:24
Yeah, I thought the same when I bought it ha ha
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:26:34
good god! someone who likes to write about things he's interested in! unbearable, the travesty!

\&gt;I obviously haven't read it but if the author accepted that as an accurate description I just don't know if the full book is worth my time.
I thought the same, but the book ended up only taking about a day to read.
\&gt;FWIW, nobody is building miners out of Video cards anymore and I don't think anyone has mined that way since maybe 2012 or 13.
They are on Ethereum.  Also, one part of the book I liked was he knew his history, which is more than I can say for a lot of the criticisms I've read.
\&gt;Yeah, most ICOs are a scam but I don't see what that has to do with Bitcoin (and this is a BTC sub). BTC was never ICO'd.
Yeah, admittedly, not all of the book is centered around BTC, but I figured I'd post here as well.

I don't think it's even handed at all.  However, being a cryptocurrency advocate, I want to hear the most pointed criticism I can get my hands on, and so far this has been the best I've read.
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:48:11
Jesus, I've never seen so many people attack a book without actually reading it.  Mind blowing.
\&gt;He criticizes "code is law", which is an infantile notion anyway. We don't need code to be law in order for the consensus mechanism to work.
His argument would probably be there are more efficient mechanisms for distributed consensus than a block chain.

Judging by your username I'd say you're right, $6 might be too steep for your right now.

Ah, yes, gotta love Reddit.  Completely unable to even consider criticisms.  I'm a big time cryptocurrency supporter and investor, but I'm not going to write off valid criticisms for absolutely no reason.
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:17:13
Ohh, I'm definitely going to check this out.  Thanks!

He points out the large difference between PoW and PoS, and that is that one is external staking and the other internal.  But I struggle to see the difference between the two, as they're both still economic staking.
I think at the end when the guy asks about PoS Andreas sums it up well.  With PoW you think it's harder to get access to the miners, with PoS you think it's harder to get access to the currency (and he makes a good point when poking fun at the DAO hack).
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:12:01
as opposed to PoW = the rich decide?
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:40:03
That's true for Bitcoin PoW but not all PoW algorithms.

In the case of Casper it's artificially enforced in that the deposit is stuck in the smart contract for a certain number of blocks.  Although I suppose one of the drawbacks may be that the deposit is in fact locked in the smart contract.  In the case of PoW you're free to buy and sell as you say.
