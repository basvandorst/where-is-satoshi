Brilliant. Kind of what I was talking about.
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:40:31
Totally. From that one comment.

Obliged. I'm sure there is a way, but is it worth it haha. Thank you again.

Oh.. what.. No qwerty work needed?

Well, I imagine it'd only be accessible by the individuals that own it. I'm confident anyone who was returned access to their property would be grateful.

Can't help but wonder.
Lets say I bought that computer. Would there be any way of finding the BTC in it?
The thought of going into business of searching old computers for stored cryptocurrencies and potentially returning it to their rightful owner sounds like quite the gig.

My bad. I meant to ask after it's been factory reset

Many thanks for the clarification.

I really gotta learn how to mine. In order to be a miner, I have to learn to code first right? I'm looking into Viper.

It sounded to me like "miners" verified the blocks in the chain, something like that. Boy was I off.
edit: I just heard I got paid in btc/eth for doing so, and I sure could use the work.

Good thing they own the debt. Ass holes.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:08:58
Sounds like monopolizing

I'm under the impression people have cashed out bitcoin and etherum.. I've seen them flashing their gains and cars T-T

Try being poor, and intimidating looking.
