I've been using bitwallet for a couple years now, I don't think it supports Segwit at this point. I do like it and plan on keeping using it though, and I hope they add support for it at some point.

Wanted to update and correct my post, it does support Segwit. Create a new address and you can create a Segwit address from there.

The second question was: "What the hell are all these ugly things scattered around the house and why are they so noisy? Also how much did all this crap cost?"

When I first got into Bitcoin my wife asked me the same question. While I'm sure my analogy is flawed, it was good enough to get her to understand it a bit better.
My point was this. What is the actual value of a $1 bill? There's the paper and ink which must be worth something. What about a $50 bill? $100? Why is one "worth" more than the other?
The answer, of course, is "because we say it is" and as a society we assign it value accordingly. A one hundred dollar bill is worth what it is because someone will give you services in exchange for it. We use payment services to make the number of dollars in my bank account go down and the number of dollars in yours go up. Sound familiar to anyone?

No, very, very little. I would be shocked if you noticed any difference at all.
I'm sure someone could chime in with some actual numbers, but it's insignificant.
