it'll be interesting to see if lukes proposal to reduce the block size ever gets implemented in light of all the complaints recently
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:35:05
this is infuriating to read. why is this being debated, how are people speculating on whether bitcoin was removed or not ?
bitcoin was accepted as a payment method before, now it is no longer there. end of fucking story

when you make a transaction, for your transaction to be confirmed, it must be included into a block that miners find. the smaller the block size, the more people must pay to be included into the next block because they're essentially bidding against each other. when the block size is larger, like on bitcoin cash the blocks are large enough for everyones transactions, so nobody is bidding against each other and the fees are pretty much none existent.

it doesn't work - this is why bitcoin is being branded as a 'store of value' despite the white paper title of bitcoin being 'an electronic cash system' this is why they're actively trying to get the white paper edited. bitcoin cash is basically preserving the original vision, and it works flawlessly. transactions are basically free, and guaranteed to be included into the next block.

No, the fee will be the same regardless of the amount you're transacting

you paid a high fee because bitcoin is clogged, see here:

yes, fees are ridiculous on bitcoin right now - and your not the only one thinking its not functional, most of which are using bitcoin cash. bitcoin cash split away from bitcoin on august 1st to solve this issue of high fees

this thread is disgustingly petty. if people here are truly having difficulty comprehending this wallet (maybe one of the simplest wallets out there) then you've got worries bigger than blurry eyes. this wallet clearly lays out both coins separately. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:24:40
What do you mean by that? If the network is conjested worse than it is now with 300kb blocks, people still have to bid against each other to get into the next block to open up their LN payment channel. I'm sure the fees will be low in the short term when wallets add segwit support, but thats only thinking short term.
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:51:51
My only concern with the LN is the cost to open and close a payment channel; to do so you must transact on chain first which would be a nightmare with full blocks, which would most likely be the case since core want to avoid a block size increase.

Have you tried Gemini?
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:57:53
It took me a very long time to get verified as well, over a month at least. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:10:43
yeah, i bought a few from these guys awhile ago with no problems
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:41:38
I accidentally sent a transaction paying 10.30 sat/B just yesterday from my Ledger, but managed to get it confirmed using viabtc's transaction accelerator. I was trying on and off all day and managed to get lucky. I'd suggest you just keep trying viabtc's so you dont have to pay.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:11:09
Yeah, I've heard really good things regarding Gemini for what its worth on this sub. You may have to be prepared to wait a long time for the verification though.. It's been a couple of months at least since I got verified and it took them awhile, but hopefully you wont have to wait as long as I did. Good luck!

This is absolutely ridiculous. The other day he posted a poll asking what people thought about reducing the block size to 300kb. Opening a LN payment channel would be insanely expensive since you have to pay the fee for an on chain transaction before being able to open that channel; the same network that would be clogged into oblivion with 300kb blocks. I really hope he's the only core dev in support of reducing the block size since we're currently sitting at 60k unconfirmed transactions with 1mb blocks.

Yes, it's quite simple. Configure your c-lightning onion node through the Wells Fargo connected tor hub while listening to the appropriate ports, configure the headers for 'Y' and prepare to launch your open channel making sure your third watcher oversees your transactions to prevent fraud, while also leaving a clear disclaimer to customers that funds may be lost in the process as this is experimental technology and makes no guarantee that bugs will not occur as per the official Blockstream™ whitepaper.

I use this site:  also: 
You can actually set alerts with the first website so you'll be notified when the price reaches an amount you input if you want as well.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:07:00
Yeah, you should use Coinfloor. If you deposit 1k, you can trade with no fees. You could also buy any amount above 20-30gbp i believe it is using the express buy but you will have to pay a 3% fee, which is negligible. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:21:25
Well, I can't say the name without getting banned here, but I think you know which I'm talking about. :)))
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:43:57
why should he? (im out of the loop)
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:57:53
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:44:04
so is bitcoin guaranteed to split at this point?
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:38:11
does anyone have a link to the site that detects if bitcoin has split ?
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:59:30
i wish this was compatible with my phone, looks good though
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:12:09
if you have the cash spare, you may as well go the extra mile and get a hardware wallet, but a digital wallet where you control your keys like electrum would be just as good as long as your seed is secure and the PC you're using is clean. if you're worried you could format your computer before setting up the wallet, gl :)
