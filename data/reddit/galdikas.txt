I am all for bitcoin, but calling a crash a sale is ridiculous.

Well they charge 20c for logging in to mobile banking, which really is the only way to find out your balance :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 00:56:05
Ah ok then. Just a matter of different keys then. Is principle the same as RSA though? 
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:29:32
So what in you opinion is a good investment?
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:54:51
The aren't voting against democracy. And not all things should be subject to democracy.
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:20:05
You are moron yourself. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:42:52
For what type of work are you paind in BTC? Im genuinely curious
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:38:15
I mean do you get paid for your work with bitcoin by choice?
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:01:05


Banks are their worst enemies. I mean 20 cents to check my fucking balance?
@_date: 2014-06-12 09:46:49
At least he checks his facts
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:31:30
I suppose the democracy works so!
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:40:33
just a joke :)
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:19:00
Well to be honest I at the moment don't get charged as I have a student account. But my colleague is in the same bank, and she gets charged every time she checks balance. It is not really an option for her to change bank as she has mortgage on it.
And as for me, well you be sure I will change as long as my student account status finishes.
@_date: 2014-04-09 00:32:38


I fully understand that. I thought this was similar concept to RSA private and public keys. As far as I know there is no way to work out public key by knowing private key in RSA, or am i wrong on this one as well? :D
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:03:10
pre-pay pre-orders more like lol
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:03:36
Yes one of the metrics. It should not be main one. All of the 3 companies you have as examples are way over valued if you ask me. I.mean Twitter 50bn? What's it's revenue again?
@_date: 2014-04-09 00:06:02
So how come the reverse is impossible?
Not being snarky. Genuinely curious :)
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:07:32
If you know private key, but not the public one, there is still nothing you can do. Or am I wrong?
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:19:21
Can't believe this is not the top link in here lol

Since when customers are expected to approve/disapprove deals that company makes?
@_date: 2014-04-15 11:06:45


Is it just me, or does this sound delusional?
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:11:28
What exactly looks photoshoped for you? The blurred out parts? :D
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:04:46
Ah ok.  I suppose in your case it kind of makes sense. Thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:34:34
I never said I was being personally screwed, but just because it does not affect me personally does not make it right.
And yes I realize that providing ebanking costs money. But to charge 20c for each log in, does that really seem reasonable for you?
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:36:36
Ah ok, fair enough :) On what show was he saying it?
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:27:54
And is this by choice?
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:14:37
Why do you submit this as self.post? Why not just link to the place where he actually says that?
@_date: 2014-06-19 11:03:33
Came here looking for someone to have done that lol Thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:56:04
plz respond
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:39:23
Well this is the first time I heard of it.

Anyone with any business acumen will tell you that basing company valuation on user number alone is fucking stupid.
@_date: 2014-05-07 10:39:35
very science!
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:03:29
@_date: 2014-04-15 11:17:04
yeah right
@_date: 2014-07-08 19:13:32
Here is their fees list. I cannot find where it says about price of logging in (just says 20c per transaction, maybe checking balance counts as transaction?), but my co-worker was telling me that every time she checks balance there is 20c charge. Unless maybe she did exaggerated lol
Anyway before Danske Bank closed down retail operations, and I had regular non-student account I would pay 30-50 euros in fees per quarter, still don't think that is reasonable. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:42:14
Nah the last price. Exactly 400 euro!
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:41:03
Don't forget your hat :)
@_date: 2014-05-13 00:54:00
And why did you go for BTC? I mean bitcoin is awesome.. but I mean you can't really buy most of day to day things with it. How much percent wise do you end up to converting to fiat?
@_date: 2014-05-01 14:18:55
Yeah. Artificial interest is going to help bitcoin greatly!
@_date: 2014-06-14 17:09:05
no it doesn't really :D They probably just switched to a different pool or something :)
@_date: 2014-05-06 14:21:34
Im in.

What about schools then?

You are assuming he is interested in reality?
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:33:55
I'd say it is more to with paypal!
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:15:03
Well they are only going to distribute the current BTC pro-rata to customers. And they commit to repay remainder over time with 50% transaction fees.
No real commitment to fully reimburse everyone that got burned. All they are sayning is - "Here have a 1BTC for this whole exhange, and we will see what we can do"
@_date: 2014-06-30 11:46:37
Maybe they have capital available?
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:09:50
Why you assume that they live under a rock and have not even heard of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-05 11:57:23
to the moon!!!!
@_date: 2014-06-14 09:48:56
why would you think that someone with a right brain would just pull 1PH???
@_date: 2014-06-12 10:10:50
Well if enough people type it in, it will get noticed! Still good imo!
@_date: 2014-05-31 10:48:18
Actually it is not same at all. I cannot convert to Swahili from English in like a blink of an eye, can I?
I am all for Bitcoin, but this is just another bullshit thread with bullshit reasoning.
@_date: 2014-07-08 02:01:21
To the moon! 
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:08:47
So what do you call all these exchanges?
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:10:42
Satoshi to bitcoin is like cent to euro :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:18:11
People give their bank log-in to 3rd parties?
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:08:28
What the fuck are you talking about? Even if it's cloud it still is either network or physically. Like what are you implying? Some 5th dimension or something? 
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:10:09
So..  They again are hiring engineer to build something for them? :D
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:03:45
Dang... this never occured to me. What will we do in strip-clubs if paper money be gone?
Letting stripper scan your QR code is just not very exciting :(
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:56:09
Yeah i need confirmations. Can you send any resources on how to do that? 
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:54:52
I looked into that.  But from what i can see,  the confirmations are received directly from them,  so whoever is running it could screw me very easily lol.  Otherwise, it seems very straight forward to use! 
@_date: 2015-03-31 01:34:18
Sorry. I may have not been clear enough. I mean accept online (as in build a service). So I nee some sort of API, without any 3rd parties involved.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:15:26
Bitcoin is fiat, isn't it?
@_date: 2013-04-01 00:39:58
Not necessarily. I have a friend that won $12.000 in online tournaments in ~2 years. (and no, that is not his only occupation, but rather a hobby)
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:51:44
Well gold does have intrinsic value, it is actually useful isn't it? (as opposed to a fiat banknote)
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:33:00
Ah ok. I thought that fiat was simply something that did not have any intrinsic value to it :)
