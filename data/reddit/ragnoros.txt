Sorry if i'm late to the party.. but finally i did the right thing. Some BTC are on the way, Andreas! You changed my life, and i feel bad for not donating much MUCH earlier! Tho.. i did not know that of all people, you struggle this hard. C'mon guys, Andreas deserves to never worry about money again. He literally made a million millionaires. Give something back!

the biggest and "most liquid" stock in the world is AAPL with 900B marketcap and about 25m 24h volume. Cryptos have half the marketcap and about 1000x the volume. so yeah, i love that cartoon, but it's very easy to pick on fiat and the stock market these days^^

I actually thought bitmain would have sold most of their bcrash to suckers after the insane oktober? Pump... they played this even worse then i thought -_-
@_date: 2018-08-23 09:11:06
At the time when BCH pumped and was speculated to overtake btc, the only reason i did not dare to ride the wave was my fear of bitmain/ver to massively dump on the community. I knew roger had mismanaged his fortune to an insane extent. He went from 300k btc holdings to 80k before the bch fork. Then, before all hell broke loose we got news that he had sent 60k more bitcoin to bitfinex. I was dead certain he would play this opportunity right by pumping first and follow with dumping tons and tons to maybe get back some of his lost btc fortune. Little did i know that he is indeed as stupid and greedy as i am. Now, 3/4 of a year later he still has only 20k btc left and is sitting on mt.everest sized turd position. Welp, so much for the best and brightest. For everyone afraid that some smartass will just collect a lot of btc, this is a good lesson. These old giants are letting blood and btc is getting in more hands in smaller quantities. And also, the 2017 fork-attack will soon be history.

okokokokokok. Sooo, the system that has to pay... 14 triilion dollars in just intrest for 2014 is not at all in danger! noooo, ofc not. The fed will keep printing 85bil a month, in half a year maybe 120bil, and all will be fine. The way it will really play out is neither a secret, nor is it going away by you denying it. 
The fed can either increase the intrest rates and the whole world can go in a controlled, thoughtthrough recession and cut government programs, military spending and so forth (witch is VERY unlikely since they are all ball-free humans), OR (much more likely) just keep printing, keep blowing a bit of air into the deflating bubble and watch as the control runs through your fingers. Ben bernake is leaving the fed, and i bet he knows that their instruments have long passed the point of no return. 
All it takes is a bigger trigger for all the 12 foreign trillion dollars to be sold. Whatever it is, the markets are unpredictable on this. When this money is coming home to the US, you will see the start of hyperinflation, and i promise you, noone wants to be the last out the door. 
In that panic no Fed on earth can safe the dollar. Humans use papercurrency for over 2000 years, and in those years it was always backed money-&gt;fiat currency-&gt;recession-&gt;bakced money-&gt;fiat currency-recession and so forth. We have over 120 examples of fiatcurrencys going into hyperinflation, because the powers at the time were neither willing, nor able to adress the real issues that come with pure-debt backed-currency. 
This time is not different, except the fact that the whole world is running this fiatexperiment together. So the bellyflop will be the more painful.
But one thing for sure is different this time! We have the ability to start a new system. We have the internet, we have Bitcoins! We can in fact change the world for a better! And in a better world, there are no central banks :) cheers
Edit: spelling

this story ended 2 weeks ago. With a little research into the behavior of all the other bitcoin exchanges and their press releases about the malicious attack make it unmistakenly clear that there is no security problem in bitcoin whatsoever. Either Gox gambled with their customers coins and lost them or they just stole them.
Its the Fort Knox model all over again.

I don´t see the big problem. The more value flows into bitcoin, the more bitcoins are goin to be cashed out by said people to buy real wealth. Then those paid out bitcoins make their normal journey into the hands of all the other to work with it.
Yes there are a few people getting rich with their early on advantage, but that is true for every invention, every currency in existence and as far as the market value of the bitcoins used by the masses in the eye of limitless splitablility... does it even matter?

"this one graphic" gives out "denied".
It may be correct that moneyprinting in itself is not enough to set of the hyperinflation. But since the distrust in the dollar is growing, and most economys are slowly geting crushed under the load of their state, it still is only a matter of time until the exponential function hits its inevdable end. Debt simply does not go away by itself. Either default on it, or wait for inflation to escape your control. We are living on the back of the unborn. This simply cannot end well.

well, a 51% attack only means that you have a 51% chance to be 1 block ahead. leta lone this chance being melted on the watch. 25.05% for 2 blocks, 10.025% for 3 blocks and so on. If, for any reason there is the KNOWN danger of someone controlling over 50%, if there is aworthwile purchase that could potentially be worth trying an attack, what hinders the recipient from just waiting 2 hours? by that time the doublespender would need like 99.999999999% of the systems power to have even a slight chance of keeping his personal non-broadcast- blockchain up. and aside of this, noone else is damaged but the one megabuyer, who couldnt wait a few hours.

honestly, with services like Salt Lending around the corner, there will be next to no reason ever to sell your BTC. You will take a loan with your BTC as colateral, and when your btc rises enough in value, so a major chunk of your colateral can be freed up, you can simply take another loan, pay back the old one, rinse and repeat. People do it in fiat, they will do it in cryptos. Dont sell your holdings, just live of them in this fashion.

This is not entirely true. Gold is used as a currency for international Energy settlements. (Oil, Bullion banks, Oil producing middle east) Just as with BTC, Gold appreciates due to the majority of it being locked away by wealthy hoarders. As long as this gold is not allowed to bit on goods, the price appreciates slowly but steadily as Fiat devalues, but not on its own accord. Your last point, i also disagree a bit. If cryptos are used as a widespread currency, again not that much has to move. We can trade half the world with BTC with only a handful of coins actually moving. This is the gigantic advantage versus Gold. Divisibility &amp; portability are superior to any physical asset.

yeah, two weeks ago i went to a local retailer to buy furniture for about 3000$. They were quite eager to sell and even activated half their management after i told them "i will buy this stuff right now, but only if you accept bitcoin" - the deal never happened, it was too much of a burocratic barrier. Still i had a lot of fun, and bought the stuff 1 week later with fiat. I hope they checked for BTC again, missed opportunities being great advertisement i think :)

this is such a childish point of view. Aside of the notion, they could buy up all coins being plain wrong, and them being able to destroy the value (im looking at you, 500.000 rupie note) being just as wrong, them stopping BTC alone will change next to nothing. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there. How can you argue like this? Do you really think that all the smartest heads in this world work for governments?

i tried trading of various commodities. Stocks, PM´s, Cryptos... at the end of the day, its always a 0-sum game for me, because A: I cannot time the market, B: as much as i want to think of me being a rational person who isn´t flimsy and can push through sound moneymanagement and risk strategies, over a trading cycle of say, a year, i make still enough mistakes to eat up all possible gains. Whenever i win i increase my risk without my sane personality having a say in the matter, therefor, now, i just Hodl. Learn about yourself in both scenarios. How do you act when you loose, how do you act when you win? If your emotions are getting in the way every time, trading may not be the thing for you.

The old system is like the old skin of a snake. The new skin is almost fully developed and the time to leave behind this old empty shell is near :)
