Hopping to a new chain every six months? That is *the worst* scaling solution I’ve seen proposed so far. Good luck keeping nodes and miners around the world continually up to speed, the chances of having immutable and secure chains every six months is practically zip at that point. It won’t be long before nodes have to validate gigabyte blocks. That’s a good joke.

FYI most of this shit does not make sense to me. But you quickly get a sense of just how complicated, genius and secure bitcoin really is.

Andreas got me to leave alts for BTC. I know it’s a little old but his book mastering bitcoin is still a phenomenal read. I did more digging and research in a YouTube series on how bitcoin works, and went further into the rabbit hole of lightning network.
A few key light bulb moments for me
* bitcoin is THE open source blockchain project the worlds best developers, scientists, mathematicians, etc in the crypto space are all concerned about and looking to build solutions for. This reminds me of the early internet, and I’ve learned the internet scaled with layers on top of it. Https, www, email, etc. and layers to bitcoin like LN are the beginning of the end of the narrative that bitcoin cannot scale.
* massive amounts of people commit to bitcoin. Massive, more then any other crypto in the space. Stanford holding huge bitcoin conferences for the best minds/thinkers to weigh in on its future? Sheesh. 
* bitcoins UTXO accounts model is safe as fuck.
IMO I am more bullish on bitcoin then any of the other coins. This is the coin the world will absolutely participate in. The space truly is still young and has a lot to grow, I think this is actually going to unfold much like the internet did. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:55:07
Yeah apparently you missed the massive conferences where a second layer solution was the overwhelming consensus reached to scale the chain over bigger blocks two years back. You people are so easily had. Do you even realize 8mb ain’t shit given bitcoins network growth? You’d have a contentious fork again in less then a year. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:01:07
I agree with everything you said, but I think lots of his comparisons to the upbringings of the internet has me realizing that bitcoin will probably experience the most global participation and is consequently the one I'm most bullish about longterm. Zero doubt other cryptos will also rise and help fill the space, some more explosively in the interim then Bitcoin but ultimately I can feel that when you step outside of the Reddit/Twitter/youtube discussions, Bitcoin is getting the most hands on it in just about all aspects.

In the context of BCash, apparently nobody. 
Kind of a funny argument all the bcash proponents put up. But my tx feeeez but buying muh coffeeeeeee. Well, data doesn't lie. Go buy some shit.

I mean I get this sentiment but in this entire space, (David Vorick, lead dev of Sia) is seriously the real deal. Are you willing to bet against him here? Because I'm not. I've GPU mined a shit ton, spent upwards of over $20k on equipment since I've started and I've just recently started to wean myself off and part out my rigs for good. It's still fizzling out, but these emerging ASIC manufacturers who are shadily and silently doing stuff in the background are very real. There are massive players entering this game building entire companies around gaining hash rate and ASIC-resistance is time and time again going to get defeated, and the story is going to repeat itself. Projects are going to continually be blindsided when they find out that their hashrate has been going to some background ASIC mining *for the last 9 months* without anyone even suspecting it. I'm interested to see how ASIC's will challenge Monero's frequently scheduled PoW changes, but the takeaway here is that ASIC's are more malleable then we thought. And this can be shown by how quickly someone ugly like Bitmain can bring an ASIC to the market, and this speed is only going to increase.

binance mobile is still unmatched. would prefer bittrex to go this route though because i prefer a us based exchange

having transactions happen off chain on side/child chains &gt; bigger blocksize. Especially with something like bcash that has what, an 8mb blocksize? That might sustain things for a year tops at this growth and we'd be back to bitching about shit being slow and expensive and how there needs to be a fork utilizing satoshis true vision. I'd rather not get three years down the road with this growth and have to have gigabyte blocks validated. Foooorget that.

EXCELLENT DEV TEAM. RUMOR HAS IT CHINESE GOVERNMENT WILL CHOOSE THEM TO BE THE MAIN CURRENCY OF A DECENTRALIZED CITY
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:51:43
What are the odds Chinese still find ways to get their money back into BTC? Can they legally exchange for another nations currency then just VPN + coinbase or something ? Something tells me lots of this money will find its way back once things start rebounding 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:20:54
QTUM isn't *for* bitcoin, per say, but they did manage to do what Rootstock was trying to do very well while integrating it into one token. Hard forking the UTXO acounts model and integrating it with the EVM is sweet, I hope their x86 EVM works out well for them too. The acounts abstraction layer they implemented is really cool stuff. I'm consistently surprised that QTUM is priced lower then, say, NEO. Rootstock wanted to float above/agree with the actual Bitcoin network, where QTUM created its own. I think that's correct-ish it's been a while since I looked into QTUM, I held some back in September and got owned by the China ban. I think the PoS model on QTUM kind of sucks, like rolling a dice for a reward. Iv'e yet to be convinced by anyones PoS yet.

Im in the camp that it is the risk of participants to partake in an ICO. It should be up to the investor to determine if said ICO is scammy, much like funding a kickstarter project. If you lose, thats on you. I dont feel like any government should be trying to "protect" people from this shit.
