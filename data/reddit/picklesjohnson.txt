This makes absolutely no sense, to shun and deny business in a place that are simply following their laws. It's ridiculous and like a child throwing a tantrum.

It's completely ridiculous.

Don't waste your life on bitcoin, or any other crypto for that matter. It's Libtertard hype along with anarchist and criminal support, you don't want something that has been twisted from a good innovative idea into an object used by delinquents to cheat others out of their money and traffic illegal things like drugs and people. Its gone to hell and its not likely to come back. Just pursue something real.

PayPal isn't universally despised, not with 150 million accounts 
Sounds like a couple people still use them.
I never made any statements as to the PayPal/bitcoin 'deal' my comments were about the buttfuckery of hypocrites that have constantly talked about their desire to ruin PayPal with bitcoin, and how much they hate, yet to only now with this 'big deal' its praise all around...see my point? My comments are about contradictory statements.
Now if you want to talk about the 'big deal' sure...Sure its big, IF it happens, could lead to some interesting usage of bitcoin, perhaps add some regulation, make it stabilize, not be so volatile and actually act like a currency instead of a get rich quick commodity because it can't be both, it wont work if it is, but that will also take its mouth-breathing frothing rabid users to decide too, but since so many are hell-bent on making a buck rather than seeing some kind of feasable usage plan set in place, its not going to get there quickly...

The reason people launder money is because they are trying to cover up ill gotten gains that are from result of a separate crime, so its crime upon crime...
and your semantics over 'their' is really fricken moot, money gained through crime is not actually theirs, nor is property acquired bought through crimally gained monies.
imahotdog's statements are dead on and true though, its why all of you are downvoting him, because the truth is hurting you, big time.

I can totally understand that, yes the spectrum is very vast. As much compared to highly skilled devs, construction engineering is much the same, skilled designers, developers, whether mechanical, structural, electrical, etc, all design in the building system along with architects for the tradesman to build or install, so something similar to devs and engineers designing software and equipment for IT people to install and administer for the end users.
Asking for the pay is one thing, but as pertaining to the topic, demanding is there the lines get drawn, it can be viewed as disrespectful and rude and will surely get one terminated. Asking is fine, demanding is not, even if that person is a highly skilled valued employee/associate/partner, that is not appropriate behaviour and needs to be removed to keep and adequate work environment.

Hahahaha! You really believe we want to destroy bitcoin?! Ha! 
My dear misguided friends, I shall enlighten you. Whether or not any member has bought, sold or holds bitcoin its lifespan is a gold mine of humour provided to us by your very selves. You wise and great ancaps, libertarians and 1%ers of all things software code, networks, economics and technology provide us with years of entertainment value through your messages of bitcoin. 
Destroying bitcoin would end important principles in which our humour is built on, and that would indeed rock the foundations of our very existence. That must not happen bitcoiners, MUST NOT! So I do implore you to progress in your 'investing' and continue on with your 'businesses' and your conferences and your bitcoin celebrities (err criminals) for it all makes the world go round.
So my conclusive statement to all bitcoiners everywhere...Proceed!

Why are all of you so worried about merchants? The majority of you are consumers, you want those protections that allow you recover your money. 
The only reason you tout bitcoin to merchants and its irreversible transactions is because you want them to take bitcoins, but you fools dont spend them anyway, you just want high profile companies to accept them in hopes they will raise the "price" of bitcoins so you can cash them out for Actual Money and make a profit.
Any of you that says otherwise are liars, dellusional or completely fucking crazy ass ancaps that don't understand shit in your teenage rebellious bullshit while you are trying to fight the man.
I already know a number of you will down vote me for this, but its because the truth hurts and you fucking idiots don't like being called out.
@_date: 2014-05-19 17:16:22
Because they are mouth-breathing retards...They preach their libertarian, anarchist, and absolutely crazy irrational bitcoin non-sense, but they are simply in it for what money can possibly be made, and they are only selling their bitcoin profits off for real legal tender they can use to actually pay for their lives.
Sure there are a few that can sustain themselves on bitcoin-only trading, but whomever they are trading it to is selling it for real money. 
Those that are telling you they aren't in it for the profit are just self-delusional idiots or total liars hanging on the coattails of the fools parroting their chants in order to let the rest of the fools buy bitcoin back from them at a premium. 
So they are crazy over wall street getting involved because they believe it will make them money, something akin to their delusional belief that their digital play money will increase indefinitely for whatever reason...so why are they salivating, two reasons, idiocy or business opportunity for those capitalizing on the idiocy.

Engineering, isn't exactly the same as construction, just like you coders, we have to be educated and be able to solve problems logically, this isn't dumb labour. I fact, I have hired devs for a few projects, don't trump up the profession as only a select few can do. I have known 13 year old kids who can learn to code, I am sure a few construction workers can too...
Again, it also depends on where you are working, at-will highly competitive areas its another story. I myself have quit jobs out of boredom, I can understand that, every skilled worker needs to be challenged and being challenged properly is part of how one advances in their career, making pay demands of a company to in-part restructure their payroll process by purchasing bitcoins at a fee to pay employees with that they will with high probability convert back to fiat money in some form for yet another fee is ridiculous if not redundant process.
As it may be rash to terminate someone for this request, I wouldn't doubt it be too much to laugh them out of the room and and say "tough luck."

Money moved by Brinks/Fargo/Dunbar etc is all insured, so regardless of robbery its still covered. When the armoured car takes possession of whatever they are moving, (not always just money) they literally take possession until its signed over to wherever it is delivered. 
Also something of note, cash that armoured companies deliver to banks is picked up from the local Federal Reserve on a daily basis. Cash-in-transit is often just local, rarely is it over long distances, and companies like Brinks will offer a one time contract to move fund securely so an 'employee' is not transporting a large amount of cash in a car to somewhere...aside from say small town businesses dropping money into a local bank's night deposit box.
Bitcoin as a cash-in-transit vehicle does not offer those assurances, and if its gets ripped off, or there is a transaction error, its just gone, mother fucking gone. No merchant in their right mind is going to pay the fees associated to exchange to bitcoin, and during the processing time until their money is safely deposited as fiat into their bank, possibly lose a chunk of their hard earned revenue to the volatile and falling values of bitcoin, all while there is no insurance or security protecting them and their funds. Those risk vastly outweigh the security and the fees by an armoured car company.

So very true, such an amazing statist tool. A little bit coding updates, using the blockchain these libertards find so precious, we can not only track and tax the transactions, but who they are to, and their locations, and with some government legislation around the world, we can have all wallets linked to ID's so every transaction is tracked and regulated. Then we can start to remove the illegal bullshit from the identity of bitcoin. With the tracking in place it can be used to arrest every criminal, anarchist and terrorist using it and essentially make it a clean global fiat currency for everyone to use.

Bitcoin is just another way to make money, nothing more. 
The ones chanting free markets, decentralization and the like are the libertarians, anarchists and criminals trying to use system for their own illegal uses and they just belong in prison anyway, so who cares what they think.

I will engage how I see fit, with upfront statements. No beating around the bush here. What I hate is the mass stupidity displayed by bitcoiners, cult-like morons chanting their idiocy over and over, bitcoiner support of criminals and illegal behaviour only for the instance to raise the 'price' of their bitcoins, and considering you may have read my posts perhaps you have read there is many a reason behind them, because I posted that too. 
Also, if you don't like how I engage the communty, eat a dick...

Seems like you annoyed them for the last and final time then, No one wants to hear about this crap.

Lulz....the amount of humour here is so much...I...Hahahahahaha you silly neckbeard you think you can sue a guy for enacting policies to protect users...hahahaha HIL-FUCKING-LARIOUS
Keep it up brosef, its laughs like this that keep churning.

It's hilarious how all you buttcoiners openly hate Fox news....UNTIL they run a story promoting your Buttcoins to people...two faced fools, all of you.

hahaha, now this is hilarious, considering just a few months ago, Amagi was claiming to stop taking USD payments, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Oh the IRONY HAHAHAhAHAHAhA!

Nothing of the sort, nice straw man argument...worthless.

That's very cute, but I am not the law breaker, he is. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:42:41
The dude is going to jail forever and he should. As well all the other criminal elements surrounding bitcoin.

I personally like the NSA and they do a good job, could be better, but not good enough. They need to keep their employees in check, having leaks like Snowden are not good for national security, now there is a criminal, a self confessed criminal, he needs to rot in prison...after his conviction of course.

Nothing about being a control freak, but criminals like DPR and Snowden and all the law breakers should face the judge and jury for their illegal shit, it has nothing to do with letting consenting adults do what they please, there is a legal system for a reason. You rambling about their needs to be a victim is just chatter of trying to get away with all the shit you are into...you probably belong in prison too!
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:50:28
That is also cute that you think that. Conviction or not, beside the point its likely it will be. Creating and running a website to sell and traffic drugs, weapons and other nefarious deeds is quite illegal in many countries. I hope to see him convicted along with all the dealers and low life users that took part of using the site. I am tired of neckbeard bitcoiner morons (like you) supporting any and all kinds of criminal bullshit because they think it will make the value of their funny money go up.
Considering I am a law abiding citizen and not guilty of anything, I am not likely to be going to prison any time soon, so there's that.
You can cease with your semantical devil's advocate as entertaining as it was, it will do you no good with me.

About time, some regulation precedents need to start getting set in order for bitcoin to be taken seriously at all. The risk of no regulation is a deterrent to use, along with the risk of total loss to thieves and scammers because there is no regulation. The only ones crying to de-regulate are the scammers, tax evaders, thieves, terrorists and anarchists, all criminals, all trying to stay under the radar so they can continue there spree of under the table use.
@_date: 2014-08-05 13:17:23
Maybe if bitcoin could handle transactions faster that would be useful, I suppose if there was a central authority to handle, tax, and track all transactions and allow for transaction reversals, it could allow for more and speedier transactions to make daily use of bitcoin more feasable it would be great, then integrate it with NFC payments so you can just tap a box at your restaurant table and you're done...

Can't with gramma working two jobs to afford the trailer, my internet, gaming subs, (don't tell grams this but also porn), mountain dew, cheetos and a steady supply of ramen don't have much money left for butts. 
Instead we been investing in cars, whenever a good deal crops up I something new, ford fiestas, cavaliers, dodge omnis, even camaros, sometimes rare yugos and stuff, minivans, I am beginning to round out my parts supply and salvage business. I am building a new sales shed in the back of the trailer on Tuesdays when games are down for maintenance and updates, then when its ready, I will put my sign up in the yard, I spray painted a nice piece of plywood for it, I nailed it right to the old toyota in the yard.  
So right now bitcoin isn't at the top of my list for my current portfolio.

I work in construction engineering; horizontal infrastructure, have done structural engineering and architecture in the past. And most attempt to not put up with it, but an at-will state with and competitive field, there is always someone newer and cheaper, especially when it comes to zero-overhead consulting and management.

Thats enough of that shit, yall stop trying to give your butts to me! No one wants that shit!
@_date: 2014-07-25 12:50:01
What do you morons expect in the free market, you wanted this, remember that.
**You meatsticks will downvote but you won't comment, because you know I am right. Free market means anyone can add to it what they want, some country wants to enterprise and create their own its all fair, but if doesn't benefit you delusional fucker's buttcoins you get all bent out of shape. 
**Fuck-it I will downvote it too...
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:16:51
You are a complete and utter moron...seriously? WTF is wrong with you?
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:36:02
Think deeper, it makes sense right...Insectoids have infiltrated the people in China. They are accumulating as much bitcoin as possible to accelerate their plan. It's dangerous and who knows what will happen. When they feel the time is right they will inject it into markets everywhere in attempt to disrupt anything and everything Settite controlled governments are doing. 
Don't fall for it, do not let the tool of the Aliens hold any power of you. We are caught in a war of Aliens battling for our planet. Do not let any one side gain the edge or it will be a disaster for us all. 
**SAY NO TO ALIENS! SAY YES TO EARTH!**
