Fake news in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:13:42
Correct - basically it’s a meme. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:11:23
And what are you adding to this discussion? Negativity and anger - great!

Agreed, so much bullshit predictions all day long. Nobody has a crystal ball but everyone of them has an agenda.

Probably just the beginning, 2017 was just another temporary peak until we go to higher levels.

It’s really interesting how all this bullshit articles are appearing periodically and are nothing more than dedicated panic tools orchestrated by short sellers.
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:21:45
Yeah I agree on that. Hope you held them until December 2017?

You must be new to crypto, better educate yourself what HODL means and where it was originated.

Pretty much doubt - the „world attention“ was minimal

Why do you spread bullshit like this? Do you really care what he thinks?

Too complex for many people, ETFs can just be bought like stocks.

Nobody knows, but anyways what’s the purpose of such posts? I don’t think it will go much lower since there is too much mainstream interest and the ecosystem is maturing with institutional investors around the corner.

Agreed. Same with most services that require a bit of research and hustle. People tend to be lazy and ignorant.

Of course this is an insane development, but where do you wanna make the cut?! What defines “moon” in your opinion and why do you think you’re an instance that can judge whether it was moon or not? In my opinion, no one can value Bitcoin etc right now, so we do not know the fair price.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:08:06
Crappy post. This wasn’t moon, it was another run, but for sure not the last one!
