That’s what broke traders say on Reddit to justify only having one monitor ��

Every wick has a news story behind it. 
It perfectly touched the 61.8% level from the bear market low to the all time high.

I had a 6th and gave it to a friend that needed it. Will replace soon.

Nice straw man. Did I say I was a liberal? Corporations are, by law, beholden to shareholders and not the public. Currently, there are 17,000 lobbyists to 535 members of congress. If you don't think corporations run our government, then who does?

Oligarchy: a small group of people having control of a country, organization, or institution.   
Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, Bush Jr. (almost) Hilary Clinton. That doesn't sound like a small group of people having control?

Would it be best to delete and repost? 
@_date: 2019-04-07 18:58:49
Lol. The same goes for both democrats and republicans. Hilary had many big dollar donations.
@_date: 2019-04-07 18:36:32
It's insane on both sides of the aisle. We have an oligarchy whose interests are corporations and not the population.

Interesting. Thanks for sharing.
