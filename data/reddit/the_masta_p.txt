WHY ARE BITCOINS SO DIFFICULT TO GET A HOLD OF
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:53:48
Precisely my reaction when it comes to purchasing bitties.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:15:53
I wish there was a legit bitcoin store. I have no idea where to go or who to trust for bitties.

Sorry to hear that man.
I think bitcoins was too volatile and unpredictable, but hopefully this issue gets resolved in favor of people like you.
@_date: 2014-04-02 05:09:36
I have 1000-2000 to possibly invest in bitcoin.
When, and how? And what do I do with it after?
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:51:34
How much did you lose? if you don't mind answering, that is.

Unfortunately, even if Michael Casey was willing to put more of your interview in his article....there is that slight offchance that his superiors instructed him not to do so, and only write the article in a manner so as to elicit responses that shed a negative light on the Bitcoin industry.
Not defending him, but just saying there's that possibility. I have no idea of who Michael Casey is or his own personal biases, but I'm pretty sure it's not the case.
But this is 'Murica. Innocent until proven guilty.

What game is this, and how do you play?
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:50:56
Oh I think I'll do quite well, thank you.

It's the bandwagon.
Everyone has time to still jump on board with BC and make money, it will double again.
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:17:48
A ploy to alter BC prices, I presume.
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:50:48
Explain more....
@_date: 2013-12-23 14:35:43
I was under the impression that it was endless.

Cabbage patch girl!

You say Bitcoins.
I say sex.
