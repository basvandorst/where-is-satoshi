The arbitrator is the service itself. We think that most disputes would come in the form of refunds/returns, rather than drawn-out evidence gathering and resolution.
In the case of a real dispute, a email support thread is created and resolution is handled manually through that support process.

There are many other areas where more value is provided, which is where we will monetize. I know it's vague but we're not ready for details yet.

Thanks for pointing that out. The landing page has been updated with the founder's name and Linkedin. The app source is also inspectable via the Chrome console and has to comply with the strict security policies that is mandatory of Chrome apps.

The date is specified when you create a SafeTX transaction. When the date expires, payment is forwarded to the seller. While the payment is locked in a SafeTX address, the buyer has the opportunity to dispute the transaction and get the payment refunded if HashTrust (or the seller) determines that there's just cause.
We are offering the escrow service for free as we believe that most transactions are earnest and in the case of disputes, most of it will be in the form of refunds/returns. The primary reason for escrows is to prevent scams, not to resolve disputes.
For that reason, cost of operating such a service is reasonble for us, and we want to make it easy for folks who are using insecure escrows today to switch to a more secure way of transacting with peers.

Every step of the transaction is logged in an activity log, and one of the steps include sending over a shipping/tracking info. The seller needs to take appropriate measures, knowing the HashTrust reputation  score of the buyer, to avoid getting scammed by the buyer. For eg., if the buyer is not trustworthy (for eg. zero reviews), then seller may insist on shipping with signature confirmation and tag on insurance, where the liability is transferred to the shipping vendor at a price premium. The service is here to help provide as much signal as possible to help both sides make the right decisions when doing a trade with potentially untrustworthy strangers.
