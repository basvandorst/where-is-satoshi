Demand is what makes the price go up, the more that sells, the higher the price goes. The less there is available makes what is available more valuable. The only reason mainstream news sometimes raises prices is because it makes more people buy which increases demand

It’s troublesome. My main thought would be the people who own a lot are selling low and causing panic so they can buy more after the panic has ended. It could also be panic selling because of anything in mainstream news. I’m debating selling now and buying again later, yes it’s at a loss but I believe it’ll rise, I just don’t know where the floor is right now

The 6k safety isn’t flat at 6k, there’s a decent resistance there. I don’t think this is the floor but hopefully we don’t find that floor any time soon. There’s some climbing left in it I think. I’m thinking July will be a better month, not McAfee’s projection but 9k is feasible. It’s looking very volatile right now, maybe 6k is where some buyers were waiting to pull the trigger.

I know he is, but his projection for June/July came up quite a bit in daily discussions. Don’t write off what the guy says just because he’s crazy, this whole thing in theory is as well and a lot of people believed him. I share his belief that it is going to climb up again soon, I just think his mark is off

Slippery slope being that government regulation is what we should all be against. But, if there were some way to monitor the exchanges with some form of punishment I think I’d be interested. Interesting thought
