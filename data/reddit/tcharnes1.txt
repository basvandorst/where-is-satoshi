Show me your exchange rate, then send me fiat through paypal or other means. Then, I'll send you the btc back minus fees.

So don't, not gonna force you.

Are you kidding me its an amazing deal for both sides. I'd be willing to do smaller amounts of money too for people to try this out. Many countries are charging a lot more for btc. I'm here to help :)

It was just an idea, and a friend just told me btc is 18k on some exchanges. So, my idea does make sense in theory.

The point is, for example:
If I have to pay 15k per btc on coinbase in USA, and you live in japan and have to pay 20k per btc, you could pay me and I'd get you the btc for less money. You say btc functions without middlemen.... yet, how do I buy btc? Through a middleman called coinbase which also charges more than the current exchange rate and takes fees on top of that. So what I'm doing is saving people money and making money in the process by improving efficiency.
I took down the post. I definitely see how it comes off scammy lol. I might make a more proper website and be back.

Exactly! I want to bring down prices and both sides can profit! Why not? :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:40:22
Yeah, but some exchanges are region locked, no? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:33:47
Yeah... so I'm slimy because I want to help others pay less for btc and make a profit. Ok. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:06:37
Ok. See you next week ;)

What? I'm confused. Please explain.
