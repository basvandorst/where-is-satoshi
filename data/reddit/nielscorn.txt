I guess kinda, I don't need the money, but atm I could turn that money in more money in a sure and steady growing rate. Bitcoin might give me a higher yield in a (far) distant future but it's uncertain.  
We'll see how it goes I suppose

Sure but what if the value of a bitcoin will just be next to nothing and another digital currency takes over and becomes the main digital currency?  
  
Bitcoin could potentially become a dogecoin

thanks a bunch for the links! I'm definitely going to check them out!  
So much to learn!

I understand what you're saying, i'll check the link when I'm home.  
  
I'm getting a anti-government vibe from you and sure the government fucks a ton of shit up but it's not all bad.  
  
So when do you reckon this will happen?(the fiat currency dissapears and digital currency becomes the main way of payment)  
I'm not trolling, I really want to know

Sure but I'm pretty sure the exact same thing can be said about bitcoin though?  
What if another currency comes up and bitcoin loses its value because the other currency is adopted instead of bitcoin.  
You'd just have a pile of shitty worthless bitcoins.  
  
I know it's not likely but still, it's a possibility, Bitcoin isn't a 100% sure thing, otherwise everyone would have bought bitcoin

I personally welcome our digital overlords.  
No no, I kid. I see where you're coming from, I'm just wondering how everything will be controlled.  
At the moment you're pretty much fucked if you send a transaction and missed.  
  
What would happen with insurance, protection of capital etc etc.  
I'm sure there are explanations and ways of doing eveything fiat is doing right now but still, I'm hesitant to bet that a total change the way currency is handled will happen in our lifetime, maybe at the end of our lifetime but I don't know when it will become so mainstream that average joe's will be buying groceries, houses, cars and more with only digital currency

I suppose that was the answer I was expecting, I also think it will go up in time(it might just crash and burn though *sigh*).  
  
Let's ride this one out I suppose
@_date: 2015-10-05 08:57:13
Well it's not really bothering me in the sense that I desperately need the money but I could use the money in a lot better ways and still I don't want to take a 50% loss on it.  
  
Guess i'm constantly answering my own questions aren't I?  
If i'm not willing to take the 50% loss and I don't really need it immediatly I should just ride it out.  
  
I suppose I came here to hear some knowledge first hand before delving into the internet where (with my limited knowledge) I wouldn't be sure which information was correct and which is false.

Well considering it's still in low value, what if good news rises the bitcoin to high hights(like 5000$) normally the litecoin would go up aswell and might even go a little higher in terms of multiplying the initial value... Like 200-300$ will be a rise of 7x instead of 1000$ of bitcoin to 5000 s 5x
Not entirely sure, that's why i'm asking

Nobody knows but i can tell you in the busiest period it took me 8 days before i got verified tier 3.
