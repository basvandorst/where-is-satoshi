Many alt coins have managed to upgrade via a hard fork without a problem. Give everyone enough warning and they can stop using Bitcoin over the forking period. I do agree with you that forking gets more difficult as time passes because of new adopters. This is why it is most important to upgrade to an adaptable block size limit ASAP. I'm no Bitcoin hater, and I'm not misled by any. I've been into Bitcoin for a long time. Most true bitcoiners operate in another unnamed sub because they've all been barred from this one.

Sure, whatever.


People will have to.


they will indeed if Bitcoin cannot adapt.
I've ridden the cycles and Bitcoin hasn't had a fee market strangling it until now.

I'm afraid I think you are wrong. A congested Bitcoin will lack a good medium of exchange and will lose out to alts that are both a store of value and a medium of exchange.

Yes, the ETF will take consider the one with the majority hash power.

Lucky you. You must not care too much about the current fees. How long will you be willing to pay market price given increasing demand and a artificial supply of space in the blocks.

Makes sense. It's a settlement network now.

It's not a coordinated attack. This is one of the only ways (besides posting ads on this subreddit) to let new users know that this subreddit is heavily cens0red.
I'm sending these messages to warn new users of The voting mechanism operates on both subs but only heavy cens0rsh1p operates here.

Why would I use my regular account for this? :P

I'm expecting to change it anyway. Also, it's not anonymous. Bitcoin is a dangerous place.

I've actually received many a positive feedback. They all say thanks. Some negative responses sure, but mostly positive. People will route around censorship. This is all I'm doing. Have a nice day :D

Hey, did you receive my message?
@_date: 2017-03-02 11:50:12
Reported. Mind your English. The mods allow through whatever suits their narrative. My comment was originally removed from here.

I'm not sure how you are able to see my comment here. No-one else can. Log out, have a look. What you say is untrue. r/bitcoin is actively and aggressively censored. Otherwise I wouldn't have to send my messages. It's not people opinion I have a problem with. It's the censorship.
