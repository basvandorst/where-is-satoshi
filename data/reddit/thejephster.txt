I currenly have 1 BTC on Electrum. I want to transfer my BTC back to an exchange and just leave the BCH somewhere safe for a while. Will this work?
1) Download Breadwallet IOS.
2) Send BTC from Electrum to Breadwallet.
3) The BTC is now on Breadwallet and the BCH is now "hidden" on Electrum.
4) Send the BTC from Breadwallet to exchange of my choice.
5) Keep the BCH in my Electrum for the time being.
ALTERNATIVELY, I can...
1) Create new Electrum wallet on SAME COMPUTER (only have one computer..).
2) Send BTC from First Wallet to Newly Created Wallet.
3) The BTC is now on Newly Created Wallet, the BCH is now on the First Wallet.
4) Send the BTC from Newly Created Wallet to exchange of my choice.
5) The BCH is now in the First Wallet for the time being.
Do both these methods sound correct? I am scared to lose my BTC...

Never done it before, and never done it post-fork.. I don't want to lose anything else that might be in the wallet (other form of crypto)

Why is litecoin not replaceable but ethereum is?
Just wondering, I have a little of both... ~$500 in each.

Interested in this too. If I have bitcoin at Gdax, how long does it take to get it into a wallet?

Would you happen to know for my Electrum wallet, if I need to "refresh" it or do something to receive it? I just pulled the "receiving address" from my wallet, but I haven't done anything else on the Electrum wallet side...
Probably a stupid question.. but I can't get a "confirmation email" or anything right?" Heading to work in a bit so I'll be away from my computer and don't want to worry about this all day...

Is this good or bad for bitcoin and ether? Sounds like good news tbh..

There's no way I can look up anything now right? I'm mainly just worried it's gone forever...
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:43:47
Yes, so you curbed my worries, but is there anything I can do RIGHT NOW to look at my bitcoins being transfer over, or must I wait till I receive it? How long do I wait before I start to worry?
