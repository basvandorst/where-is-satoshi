They really need to update us.

This is exactly the same thing I'm planning to do. When I get to a point with Bitcoin that I could pay off all my debt, I will cash out. Who knows, by then they might even accept bitcoin. :-)

I should have withdrew sooner. I ironically received my Ledger Wallet yesterday too. I lost 0.0228BTC. About $300 atm. =( Could be worse. My coinbase coins will be taken off immediately.

I agree with your strategy. Taking profit along the way is the safest strategy. You can accumulate more during the dips. The trouble I have with the strategy is identifying where the bottom will be. Sometimes it's just an educated guess and it ends up going lower than your target buy of $6-7k or it may not reach the value ever again. Nothing wrong with you making double your money and taking out some profit.

Sweet! Thank you so much!!

Not as bad as my $400 at $10,800 today. Or my brothers $900 at $10,900 today. As we are hodlers for the long haul, this delta isn't much. Keep hodling!

GMO does plan to sell their 7nm ASICs. I'd hold out for the latest innovation with much improved power efficiency and higher hash rates.

And right now Bitcoin is sitting below it's ATH! Perfect time to buy before Big Bang and Nasdaq.

Are these going on sale for Bitcoin Black Friday?
