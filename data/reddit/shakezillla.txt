Ok, I think I understand this now. Thank you!

Can you explain this further? I still don't understand how your coins are safe if you can access them through a desktop wallet with the seed from the hardware wallet

Alright, so what percentage of nodes would need to switch chains for you to consider that nearly unanimous and define which chain is bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-11 23:44:47
That *still* doesn't answer the question.
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:45:36
You didn't address the question 
@_date: 2017-02-04 07:09:10
A lot of cynics in here

Alright, we're getting somewhere. A consensus is just an agreement that the majority accepts. What percentage of nodes would need to switch chains for you to consider that a consensus and define which chain is bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:45:51
What other metrics, then, matter? Also thank you for finally giving a concrete answer. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 18:02:08
That still doesn't address the original question 
@_date: 2017-02-11 23:37:48
But that is the way things are defined. If not the majority, then, who would have the right to decide what chain should be called Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:34:13
It's how you *stay* a billionaire
@_date: 2017-02-11 21:25:32
The way we define everything is based on majority rule - what we can all agree a thing is. If everyone starts calling the new fork bitcoin then it's bitcoin just like if everyone agrees that tails are legs dogs have 5 legs. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 16:49:04
That is just stubbornness. If most everyone calls the new chain bitcoin except for you then you are the one who is wrong. You can justify your reasoning for why it's not bitcoin however you want but you would be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 01:03:35
So your answer is that no amount of people calling the new chain bitcoin will make it bitcoin?

Gemini was the first alternative that I found but I noticed that they only operate in 42 states and that gave me pause.

It would be silly to sell all of your coins at any point. You sell more as they become more valuable/you need the currency, you don't sell them all because of some arbitrary number.

There is an ocean of difference between being 'fucked up' and 'amphetamine abuse'.
They aren't mutually exclusive, but frequently the latter does not imply the former. Especially when described in a functional type of way.

The quote isn't inherently valuable, either
