First off, congratulations!!! BUT as someone who made the same mistake as you by initially and impulsively purchasing at a point where the cost was highest (first bubble) I wish you would have asked some questions to those people that have experienced first hand the three major bubbles that bitcoin has gone through. I am a firm believer that it will continue on an upward trend and within 2 years be above 3000, so if you intend to HODL there is not major concern. but after each major bubble, the price does come down again. my guess is that after this bubble, the price will come down to around 900 before settling for a little while with minor fluctuations. Bitcoin is the true representation of the saying 2 steps forward, one step back, although with each step it grows and will continue to do so for the forseeable future. DO NOT panic when it inevitably comes down a bit from this high. It will undoubtedly continue to grow as technology advances and awareness increases. congratulations once again. 5 years from now your investment will most likely appreciate by over 200%, and that is a conservative predication. i hope. cheers fella
