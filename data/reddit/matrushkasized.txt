The "can you sell 10% to earn back your total investment so the 2040 gamble is just that" option seems to be missing.

The future of money should be Joules or kWh...you know something that is actually something with an actual value..in stead of a petaflop powered Ponzi scheme.

Well you send in your "real" cash and you buy a virtual lottery ticket that might become more valuable or worthless over time. It's just that if everybody would try to unload all of their virtual currency, there just wouldn't be enough actual currency/people willing to pay for your virtual thingie with real currency to cover that bet.   
It (or one of the many many other electronic forms of payment)might someday turn into a stable currency(I don't think so but I might be wrong of course) but these days it's starting to look a lot like an electronic Ponzi-scheme to me.
All I needed to know to not ever get involved in these forms of payment was that criminals just flocked to them.
If anyone ever makes a nice blockchain operated way of trading surplus energy from my solar roof....that will have my attention. 
Until then...yeeeeehhhh "your made up something with a nice marketable name(would you buy if it was called a bit-madeup-coin?)" changes value in such a fashion that someone is going to make money because some gullible people started to buy when the people in on the joke started to sell...

I still hope someone will make a blockchain operated way of distributing energy from our solar roofs to anyone wanting to pay for that..

Will you be the one to topple the (even more virtual )house of virtual cards?

They are gonna look up Ponzi scheme and black tulip mania and cry in their alcoholic beverages.
