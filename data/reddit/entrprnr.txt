You're defending people who don't believe in bitcoin on a bitcoin sub. 
But hey, you do you.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:34:10
Don't worry. Bitcoin will make it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:10:44
So.....you sold?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:38:49
It is easy to call others weak when you've been in a space for years and held on tight without selling. 
People haven't always had great gains, it took years to get here. The people who think investing $1,000 dollars and then they can retire in a month or two do not have the technological understanding and commitment to why BTC and cryptos can and will change the world. 
They sell for a loss and are never heard from again. 
Many of us have stuck through the ups and downs and been rewarded. The person who sells out and ends up buying high when the asset goes up again will lose over and over again.
This is a long-term investment that has attracted a lot of short-term speculators. It is not unfair that they can't stick with a decision for 3 to 6 months but if they did they would sell for a higher price.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:23:08
Lol, not that bad.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:22:38
You don't consider yourself a weak hand and feel insulted by the post. Okay, so you hit your goals and exited the space...but why argue about the value of an investment you don't believe in / see very differently?
You are talking to a guy who believes in the future possibilities of Bitcoin to change the world. Part of the process and holding on when others decide to sell out. 
If he gets to sell his coins for $100,000 and you sold yours for 17k, 18k, maybe 19.5k then you both win. 
One of you will probably make more money than the other but you have different risk tolerances.

1. Looking at the dude's Twitter feed, he says he tweets about tech and culture...and he is just getting around to buying some BTC now?
2. He is saying you can't actually spend BTC easily. This is so so so wrong. There is the [Shift card with Coinbase]( and you can literally buy anything you do today.
3. Implies Coinbase and Mt. Gox are on the same playing field. Coinbase is backed by amazing VCs, has a great mission, and bleeds transparency (most of the time).
4. Brings up the Dutch tulip bubble which [really didn't happen as most people may believe](
5. He finishes on blaming Bitcoin for slow transactions. Come on, has he even read anything about the basics? If it was crypto the transaction would be done in an hour or two. The transaction is slow because the transfer of legacy fiat currency is slow and this is not Bitcoin or Coinbase's fault
Sure, Tim Draper thinks it will increase logarithmically. I completely agree on your value point but Seth doesn't even point out that Bitcoin prevents double spending of coins and is the most secure financial network in the world.

You mean tomorrow morning? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:23:43
With coinbase it would take at least 4 business days for my fiat to be available to buy more crypto. 
With Gemini, you can at least trade with fiat right away because they credit your account. That said, I would not be able to withdraw fiat or the coins until the fiat clears the bank. 
If I funded an account with Bitcoin in the morning, I would be able to buy and then do whatever I want with the crypto in the afternoon at the latest. 
It certainly seems more efficient than the bank to me. And at least coinbase is insured, so even if it all goes belly up, there is a way to resolve the issue. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:07:17
Hey I generally agree with you on this. 
When you say hold on tight and get ready to buy at the big dip...
Do you mean Bitcoin or the Alts?

I'm with you on that - I'm watching ethereum wobble up and down. 
Also thinking that it spikes back up. 
The biggest concern to me is if people sold alt currency to buy bitcoin (for the "free coins") then won't they be unable to sell the BTC to buy back the Alta at least for a day or two?

Yeah, I'm saying have your fiat currency in the exchange ready to go on GDAX or Gemini. We know these companies pretty well, they are very transparent, we know who is behind them, there is a good sense of funding, etc compared to some sketchy exchange. 
I didn't say to keep your BTC on the exchange after your buy if you don't want to. 
*also, your fiat on GDAX is insured 
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:28:22

@_date: 2017-11-07 16:33:51
No worries.
If the ledger gets stolen, the person does not have access to your keys and you would be able to buy another and recover your full wallet. 
My understanding is that the hardware of the ledger does not actually store the private key on the device and yes there is a 4 digit pin code. After three wrong entries, the device would wipe itself.
Secondly, for each transaction to be confirmed you have to physically hold down two buttons on the device. So, even if your account was hacked they would not have physical access to your hardware wallet and you and the coins are safe.

I don't personally own a Ledger but I think this is the [exact discussion you are interested in understanding more about](
From article  - "the Ledger has a proper bank-grade ST31H320 secure enclave where the wallet’s private keys are stored."
They aren't stored on the cloud that is for sure!
If stolen, they wouldn't have your PIN access code to get into the device. They can hold down the two buttons but they won't have access to the device in the way they would need to.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:02:26
Remember to do your buys on GDAX.com (this is Coinbase's digital asset exchange) to avoid fees by buying with the limit orders.

@_date: 2017-11-14 05:31:27
Hey there. The above comment hits the nail on the head. 
The legacy financial system is slow. Coinbase's business is connecting buyers and sellers of digital assets. The digital assets are fast. 
Your bank and fiat currency is slow, slow, slow. Don't blame CB, don't blame Bitcoin/Litecoin/Ethereum. Blame a banking system that requires third parties and escrow processes. 
Think about it...any transfer from your bank account is ultimately seen as the banks money. Losing the banks money is a big no no and with all the fraud and scams that happen in the system they try to make it take longer so that they can reverse transactions.

Anyone with a clue of what they are trying to discuss realizes that bitcoin is in unique territory of being part currency and part commodity.
 What it evolves into in the future is unknown. Yet there is an amazing team of engineers working to build out more features like a lightning network to lower fees even more. 
As for killing bitcoin by not spending it, check out the publicly available statistics..you've got great trading volumes, 10x growth on transactions since January 2017 up and to the right ( etc. 
The real world value is immense and is covered across the basic research anyone who is interested in investing should do before investing. (Satoshi White Paper)
High fees? More like terrible user choices to use wallets that do not allow them to control the fees for processing transactions. Or poor decisions by consumers to pay fees to buy/sell BTC when one google search shows a better solution. (
Is Amazon or Apple a bubble? Haha, tulip mania really wasn't as wild as everyone makes it out to be. It turns out it was more of a drinking game +'futures contracts gone bad (

No problem, I recommend the Trezor to people. 
After reading through all the security and issues that can come up, that seems to be the current winner. 
They just introduced the 2nd generation Trezor to ship in January and that looks pretty interesting as well. 
It also depends on how much you own right? If people have under 5k, I think Coinbase and their vault with 2FA on all online accounts is perfectly fine for the average user.

Sorry but I don't think you understand it. 
GBTC owns a small amount of bitcoin per share. If you google GBTC you will find their website with all the information. 
GBTC has a monopoly in the US market right now for allowing investment and retirement accounts to gain exposure to bitcoin. This is why it has a premium but the premium is when you compare the price of the stock to the net asset value (price of bitcoin * all bitcoin owned by GBTC). 
The market place premium is what sellers are willing to pay and it is not a fee in a sense. Yes, dumbing down the technology for non technical and older people is pretty anti bitcoin. It is also a massive market opportunity for the company to charge a 2% management fee to. 
What are the other ways for investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin? This is you post/discussion...why would you not say what you want to say?
Google CME Futures Bitcoin. Bitcoin will not be listed on the Chicago stock exchange as it is not a company. What is happening is a futures market regarding bitcoin is going live in December. It will allow futures contracts where a buyer and seller will speculate on the BTC price within a given time period (1 month, 6 months, 1 year) and it is cash settled daily with limits on how far it can rise or fall.

@_date: 2017-11-14 16:26:13
If you would like to dominate trading fees for buying or selling use GDAX. You already have an account there since you have s CB account. 
Use limit orders instead of market order and you can trade for free because you are adding liquidity to the exchange and that is the reward for doing so. 
Nobody knows if it will go up or down on the CME news. Other people think once the institutional money gets a bigger taste of bitcoin from the future market going live that there will be increased interest and money coming into the industry. 
It's not so different than day trading where you attempt to make a profit selling on the peaks and buying the valleys. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:17:54
Since you do not know the answer to this, you haven't researched bitcoin in depth. This is okay!
Point is get your feet wet with Coinbase to get started but as you learn more you may may decide to move your coins into a different wallet for storage. 
If you really do want to understand what your keys are and the tech behind BTC then read the Satoshi white paper - I wish I came across this 7 years back!
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:28:55
Thought it was $30
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:22:00
You got it! The only caveat i can think of is the minimum trade is 0.01 BTC which would be $76. 
It is that easy. 
It's not that easy if you're trading 10s of bitcoin due to the liquidity in the order book. If I want to buy or sell 10 BTC at X price it is possible there are only 8.5 BTC available and I would get a partial fill on my order. It depends on how I set my orders up though. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:58:47
Or we could answer the Q that was asked...
So you sign into GDAX and want to make a trade. Now you can choose to Buy or Sell with a market order, limit order, or a stop order. 
A market order is going to charge you a fee for the convenience of filling your order at the market right. Same with the Stop orders. 
If you do a limit order you are rewarded for contributing liquidity joy the order book. So you say I would like to buy 1 BTC at a select price it could be $7137.67 or $3,350 if you want to prep for that scenario. 
You then can click the Advanced section below and choose further details on how your order should be filled. The YouTube links should go into more detail - Deeplizard has a good playlist I would recommend as I've watched them all. 
TLDR: Use limit orders to choose the price you want to purchase BTC that works with your buy/sell/trading strategy. Don't pay fees because you add liquidity to the book or business. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:26:15
If you buying with credit, the likelihood of fraud increases dramatically. Good luck figuring something out.

Okay, I've heard the argument you are attempting to make before...it is Super Libertarian which is a fair point to argue.
That said, if you have ever used a public road, received education, used airports/train stations/bus stations, take a ride on a metro/subway/underground then guess what? Congratulations, you are a member of society!
Since you are a member of society, part of your responsibilities are paying taxes so we can drive on well-maintained roads, keep schools open, invest in transit hubs that all help us have a great quality of life and to grow the economy.
You have a point that the government has been slow to respond to the crypto space, it is taking a long time to understand it, accept it, and to build a plan for how to incorporate it into the current structure - that said we can work as a community to lobby our representatives in The House/Senate to build a better framework.
We're also still in a time of early adoption - nobody talked about net neutrality when the internet was 9 years old (BTC's age). These things will come as the space matures, guaranteed.
Take Donald Trump - he values his personal brand as being worth billions. A brand does not exist. Corporations can say they have good or bad will that can impact their taxes. Is "brand" or "good/bad will" a real thing? Maybe, maybe not.
Street fighter characters and Pokemon? Um...well yes these things do get taxed. A video game has sales tax, the creator has profits/losses that they report when they file taxes. Pokemon has in-game purchases that create income that ultimately gets taxed. There is a lot of money that comes from licensing fees and guess what...it too gets taxed.
The Govt. acknowledges that Bitcoin "exists", they just haven't decided on a plan for incorporating it. There are many things that you could argue "aren't real" in the world but it doesn't mean they don't exist.
With that logic Google and Facebook shouldn't pay any taxes ever because they don't exist. I guess you're saying on brick and mortar things should be taxed but that would be insane. 
Read about Al Capone - he was convicted of tax evasion as opposed to all of the other crimes the Govt couldn't quite nail him for.
If you sell drugs/steal + pawn items, or gamble, or make money from "illicit activity" you are supposed to report your earnings to the Govt and pay your taxes (the IRS doesn't care what you do..they want their cut).

Yes you can trade them for more bitcoin too. 
The risk of selling theoretically is that BTC could go down while the new coins go up or catch on (unlikely?)

Never assume a dip...it's always possible but not 100%.

I think it is more like, "hey...I'm not sure this thing is going to survive...let's wait and see what happens before taking a lot of time/energy/money if it dies in a year or two". 
Do remember, BTC is surging in 2017, but there was a time when it was unclear if you would come back from its dramatic fall.
Now you have a good point to discuss and go back and forth on - that being how BTC is taxed as property vs. a more desirable tax class/structure.
Another bad point - which industries should the government not tax? Do you truly believe the government should be that involved in picking winners and losers in an economy? 
I don't. Yet, I do think we should give tax incentives to certain nascent industries to help them grow (Tesla +  That said if they make a profit they're still going to get taxed.
Even if the Govt. decided to tax BTC as a currency, we would be in a much better position vs. treating it as property and having to maintain diligent records of valuations.

Again, start with the white paper. If you come away thinking, "wow, this is awesome and world changing" move forward (today, not tomorrow or next month). 
Create an account on Coinbase (I can send you a link) it will have you verify your identity and link bank accounts/credit cards. Buy your first $100 here to get your free $10 and then after that you'll want to use Coinbase's exchange GDAX.com because you can trade for free by using limit orders to buy or sell. 
I think everyone right now is still an early adopter. I'll send you a great video link (it's on my computer).  Most importantly this space is just going to 10x or 100x it is going to increase logarithmically. 
Depending on the size of your investment just hold onto it - kind of forget about it. Participate here on to stay up to date but don't freak out and sell if we dip 5, 10, 20, or 30 percent...buy more. 
Don't participate in Ponzi schemes. There are companies out there pitching cloud mining scams, shitty altcoins, free ways to make bitcoin. Ignore it all. I mistakenly participated in a Ponzi scam with PB Mining and fortunately did all right at the end of the day...but it was unnecessary. 
I lost probably 30% of my original investment and kind of got put off after that. Now I wish I sucked up my lost, replaced what I lost right away and got excited about the space again. But I didn't at the time..,and I waited a couple years before picking up interest in late 2016 when I read the white paper again.

Yep, the rules depend on where you live. 
I know CB is expanding all the time and moving their business forward with a focus on increasing how many digital assets they will support. 
GDAX.com is owned by Coinbase and is their exchange. If you buy and sell with limit orders you can avoid fees entirely. 
Gemini will will charge 0.25%. 
There are others too but I find these two are quite transparent about who is involved and the amount of capital available to support their operations. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:18:11
It's called market segmentation. 
GDAX.com is Coinbase's digital asset exchange. You have a marketplace of buyers and sellers exchanging currency for digitize coins or trading digital coins
For one another. This is literally where the market for the BTC price is happening in real time. 
There are trading fees on GDAX but they can be avoided by buying and selling with limit orders. This is harder than just using market orders to fill at whatever the current price is. 
Coinbase.com is the easiest way for newbies into crypto to set up account, verify their identity, connect bank accounts and to buy their first crypto. Coinbase actually acts as a broker here by buying bitcoin and then marking it up to sell it to you. Then they charge different fees depending on the payment type and create a revenue stream for their business. 
TLDR: established users vs. newbies. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:42:50
You're welcome. Everyone is encouraged to learn about the space at their own pace and to come to their own conclusions. 
1. The socioeconomic status of Bitcoin holders spans the spectrum of rich, middle class and the poor. It is relatively difficult to sat exactly who is doing what because the exchanges that have personal information keep it secure and you would have to match it with people's tax returns to get a true idea of the results.
That said you can [watch fiat currency turn into crypto assets here]( You can also see the distribution of [how many BTC are in each wallet here]( [Satoshi's coins are also untouched](
2. People have different end desires so it is hard to say. Some of the wallets mentioned above are probably owned by traders who want to maximize profits today, not 10 years from now. 
Other wallets are owned by companies keeping funds for the customers. While some of the bigger wallets may be the earliest adopters - Satoshi's wallets haven't been touched since the beginning.
For people who are true believes in the impacts of the technology, the goal is to do a run around to being your own bank, not requiring permission/approval from a government, if this thing gets as big as it theorhetically can then woah the price of a BTC is going to be a lot higher than it is today.
History wise (this is simplified), you've got to set the scene of what went down economically in the US + The Globe starting in 2007. Central banking systems of countries + Private banking greed + Bad decisions by citizens = A massive bubble that upon overleveraged banks, home buyers. 
At the end of the day, only one American banker went to jail after the private banks needed to be bailed out by the taxpayers to the tune of  a fuck ton of money. 
Banker - 
Bailout Cost - 
This is kind of an atrocious background of someone or some group coming together to create Bitcoin. Our protagonists built a decentralized digital asset which could function via a system of computer power from around the globe.
From the [Satoshi White Paper](
1. Create the most secure financial network in the world which would get more difficult as more computers joined the network
2. Simple transferability to facilitate transfers across the globe or amongst friends within hours
3. Be trustless to eliminate 3rd parties/escrow (the banks) but once you send your money it can not be called back
4. create a public ledger of all transactions that can be looked up by anybody
5. Be divisible into 1/100,000,000 or a Satoshi
6. Anonymity - This is true to an extent that you can have multiple wallets and if you do not broadcast your address then nobody will know it. However, BTC is no longer great for illicit activities because the transactions are ultimately public facing in some way
The real risk is that anyone ever hears about this and begins to spend their time, money, energy to participate. BTC going from $0 to $100 was risky...after that, there was always a risk but people could see how this thing catching on.
The implications of the technology of a public blockchain will have enormous implications moving forward and could impact/disrupt the entire financial system from how it currently exists. By owning coins of some asset whether it is digital or physical can take a lot of money away from investment banks and the process of having an IPO.
Moving back to BTC...it has value because money transfers suck today. If you want to fund a Coinbase account with USD, it can take days to fully clear on Coinbase's side of things and be available for trading.
If a friend sent me USD for sending him an equivalent amount of BTC then that money is there this afternoon and he can start to trade. BTC could drop or increase a lot over 7 full days rather than just this afternoon.
1. Sign up for an account with Coinbase - they are a leader in the crypto space with over 217 MM in total funding raised
2. Do your buys on [GDAX.com](GDAX.com) (this is Coinbase's digital asset exchange) to avoid fees by buying with the limit orders. Your login is the same as Coinbase and after your first $100 buy on Coinbase.com/trading to get your free $10 referral, do all your buys with GDAX to trade for free
3. One of the smartest guys in the space is Nick Szabo - he has a [mind-numbing blog]( if you have the time to read his essays. 
Here is a [great conversation with Nick and Tim Ferriss](
5. [Seeking Alpha article]( - comparing Bitcoin/Gold difference/similarities
6. Crypto Hedge Funder - [Mark Yusko Bitcoin 4k to 400k](
7. Two great communities on [Reddit General Bitcoin]( and [BitcoinMarkets](
8. With an iPhone you can add the Coinbase widget to make it easy to check the price with one swipe - just don't blame me if you get too OCD!

Dude, GBTC is backed by "0.09211978 Bitcoin per Share " which is on the front page of [Grayscal.co's website](
Obviously, it is not going to track precisely the same. There has been a premium associated with buying into GBTC because it is the ONLY fund people can buy into with a 401(k), Personal Investment Account, IRAs, etc.
This premium is above the NAV (Net Asset Value) of the funds' total bitcoin. If/when the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF the premium will evaporate overnight - you can [see it here on Bloomberg's site](
The premium as of right now is still 40% above the NAV. This is low compared to previous months when the premium was 70%, 85%, and even over 100%!
People are better off buying BTC when they could buy twice as many BTC if they have the cash to do so rather than pay a premium. The people buying GBTC may not have free cash to buy BTC or are technologically illiterate.

This risk happens if you have your own wallet and want to split the coins yourself and do it 100% correctly. 
I personally prefer not to risk it and if Coinbase will handle the split and credit our accounts the same day (which is their plan) then I'm down for that. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:08:45
Glad to be helpful!
Great, even on that order you could have saved the 0.3% with a limit order instead of the market order. That's a nice chunk of change to save either way on ~20k of coins.

Okay, so nobody has answered your question. 
You can invest in bitcoin directly from your 401k without changing a thing. 
Type in GBTC and you can buy shares of a fund backed by bitcoin. The negative here is there is a premium on these shares - it has ranged from 20% to well over 100%. 
At some point, the SEC will allow a Bitcoin ETF so the premium you would pay would disappear overnight. GBTC has a monopoly right now, but depending on the premium it can make sense to invest in as nothing is imminent with the SEC. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:39:38
I've read Satoshi's white paper multiple times and I share it with anyone interested in the space. Bitcoin decentralizes "trust" within transactions to eliminate third parties (the banks) from our financial transactions whether it is P2P or B2B or P2B, etc. 
Hence, BTC is about the disruption of a legacy financial system that has brought on bubble after bubble with nearly zero punishment (like having more than a handful of people going to prison). There is a lot of fraud in the banking sector as well which is another beautiful thing as BTC has become the most secure financial network in the world in the sense that you cannot double spend any portion of a coin.
Satoshi is a very smart individual or group of individuals. If they wanted to say that a founding reason for the creation of BTC was to say fuck the entire government and commit tax evasion, I have doubt they would have.
They said, fuck this central banking system and the bad behavior that stems from it across the banking sector. We've got a better way to transact securely and trustlessly let us show you why and how that digital system functions
If you want to look at tax avoidance that is all well and good and perfectly legal. Hold your coins longer than 365+ days and only pay long-term capital gains instead of personal income taxes depending on income level.
Tax evasion is a great way to end up in jail.

You're very welcome. I think if you read about Bitcoin , you'll fall in love with the ideas that power it. This may sound crazy, but I can imagine a world in which BTC $100,000-1,000,000.
There is a ticker of what the most recent purchase of Bitcoin was l...let's say it is $5,714. You're freaking out about it jumping to 5,750 so you just buy at the market rate and for that convenience they charge you a fee you may get to purchase BTC for 5,714 or 5,721 or 5,710 it just depends. 
A limit order is when you'll say o want to purchase X amount of BTC at 5,714.20 or 5,714.01. Once BTC hits that price it will match your buy order with a sell order for the price you asked for. 
Coinbase is charging erratic people a fee for the convenience to have their order go through and put BTC in their account. 
Coinbase rewards market makers by not charging a fee. This also leads people to leave a lot of business on the books for both buy and sell orders. I'm sure some people have limit orders to sell at $6,000 and orders to buy at $3,000 just in case it happens. 
Make sense?
We're still so early in the cycle of this asset class, that the volumes today are tiny compared to where the world is going. So you are still an early adopter. 
I sold out 8k of a 12k Roth IRA back in 2013 to buy BTC. Personally I wish I sold it all haha. I think my 4K is now $5,700 or whatever. BTC has been a much better horse to ride. 
Now technically this could all go to hell and go to zero tomorrow or today. I'm willing to bet that isn't the case and I can only imagine how pissed I would be if I missed out on turning a $5,000 investment into 100k or a lot more 5, 10, or 15 years from now.

If you only hodl, you will only pay long term capital gain, assuming you've held your bitcoin longer than a year. The rate will vary based on your income. 
If you're trading you will be taxed on gains as if they are personal income so that is going to depend on how much money you're making from your job, etc.

Okay, good. Go to GDAX which is Coinbase's exchange. If you buy BTC with limit orders you will not pay a fee (avoid market orders). 
I'm not sure what amount they will let you buy on the exchange...it may match your current account. It is slow because the fiat transfer from your bank to theirs is always slow.

I funded my BTC purchases with money from a Roth. 
The key thing is there is a 10% tax on any earnings. Do you know what the cost basis for the stocks that were owned in the Roth?
If you bought stocks for 2,000 and sold for 2,700 then you would only owe the 10% on the 700 of gains.

You're right. I was at a Villa in Bali and was forced by my fiancé to leave and go out into a world without wifi and my opportunity disappeared because BTC dipped.
I'm sorry to hear that you lost BTC trading alts, but we are talking about whether or not BTC dips after hitting ATHs. I've been holding for 4 years. What dips didn't happen for you - I'm actually curious.
We both understand stand BTC, we're passionate about it, and we agree that over the long term the price is going to go higher (100%).
That said, BTC is (obviously) a volatile asset and goes up and down every day...I believe you can take advantage of the oscillations and expand your total amount of BTC rather significantly. I also know this because I watch GDAX and Gemini every day.
You seem to believe that everyone (except you) knows shit. Why in the world would that be the case?
Consider that BTC has just had its best day ever, going up over $1,000. Great for everyone, but what happens next? Have you actually considered that there might be something you do not know?
If you bought at the ATHs in 2013, you then had 4 years to buy BTC at a discount or to pretend like your BTC didn't exist and to give up.
BTC hit an ATH of 1108 on 11/29/2013 and then it dipped over 167 weeks to 203.77 on 1/17/2015. It eclipsed the previous ATH of 1180 on 2/24/2017.
What about 2017?
From 1108 it took 161 weeks to have...
BTC hit a 4 year high of $1069 on 1/4/2017 and then it dipped over 6.5 weeks, hitting a low of $801.98 on 1/12/2017. It eclipsed the previous ATH to hit $1114 on 2/21/2017.
From 1069 it took 8 weeks to have...
BTC to hit an ATH of $1280 on 3/3/2017 and then it dipped over 7.5 weeks, hitting a low of $952 on 3/25/2017. It eclipsed the previous ATH to hit $1284 on 4/25/2017.
From 1280 it took 13 weeks to have...
BTC hit an ATH of $2893 on 6/10/2017 and then it dipped over 5 weeks, hitting a low of $1992 on 7/16/2017. It eclipsed the previous ATH to hit $2980 on 8/4/2017.
From 2893 it took 8 weeks to have...
BTC hit an ATH of $4830 on 8/31/2017 and then it dipped over 5 weeks, hitting a low of $3066 on 9/15/2017. It eclipsed the previous ATH to hit $4830 on 10/9/2017.
From 4830 it took 5+ weeks to have...
(Fill in the blank) BTC hit an ATH of $5835 on 10/12/2017 and then it dipped over ____ weeks, hitting a low of $______ (5 to 7.5 weeks later) on __ /__ /2017. It eclipsed the previous ATH to hit $_______ on __ / __ /2017 or __ / __ /2018.
I believe there are absolutely good times to buy and bad times to by. On any given day you have a 33/33/33 shot BTC is going up, going down, or staying flat.
Think about the psychology (and check out The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis). Humans regret a financial loss of $100 as more painful than financial gain $100, so they do not act rationally when it comes to thinking about gains vs. losses. Since people will not act rationally, we can take advantage of knowing there will be oscillations in the price of BTC.
For me, I get more satisfaction over expanding my BTC holdings 40-60% on the dips which are real and happen after every ATH. Mathematically, I am likely to win.
Every single ATH people think, "this time is different" or "it's never going below $1129 or $1280 or $2893 or $4830 or $5835.
You may truly want to believe that after the biggest single jump, this time is different. It likely is not.

People should be buying where they do not have to pay fees. If you are paying fees to purchase BTC, you are just wasting your money.
With GDAX you can pay no fees to buy or sell BTC as long as you use market orders instead of market orders. This also allows you take your emotion out of a buy/sell order by saying, "I'm placing an order for BTC @ $5,550 instead of 5,678 and when it hits my order will trigger".
With Gemini, feees are 0.25 basis points of your order and a drastic decrease from the fees Coinbase will charge.
Coinbase is a business and they are making money connecting the average user to the market place, and for that convenience you will pay them.
If you eliminate fees entirely or severely reduce them, everyone will own more BTC and be better off.

I didn't believe that BCH was going to have any level of success and it turns out I was wrong on that front.

Trade on Coinbase's exchange GDAX.com and avoid fees when you buy or sell with limit orders. You can then send to a wallet without a fee as well. 
Gemini would be fine too, they charge 25 basis points and will cover the transfer fee for up to 30 transfers to a wallet.

@_date: 2017-10-05 16:24:44
Longer? Technically yes. 
It is an exchange, they expect you to have cash in your account to buy today. You can still fund your coinbase account with USD then transfer that to GDAX to wait for a dip and then buy. 
You also receive the BTC from GDAX in seconds. So you can either wait for BTC purchase to clear with Coinbase or wait for fiat to clear into your account.

This person's post has a couple feelings in it. 
There's your classic irrational exuberance that bitcoin will only go higher from this point on. 
There's a sense of fear in there as well, if I don't buy now I will never get an okay price again. 
I never agreed that BTC is a bubble. Personally, I believe in the long term BTC will go higher. However, it obviously has intense volatility so I am confident it will also seesaw up and down. 
Because I know it will seesaw up and down you can take advantage of you are watching the markets intensely. 
I nearly sold at the top of the last run up in late August and would have had cash ready to go near 3k. I could have increased my BTC holdings nearly 60% and had a significant amount of value added to my portfolio.

There is a lot of Coinbase hate in here but I've never seen someone go full Apple fanboy for Coinbase until today. 
How do you feel about this? 
Coinbase has insurance if they fuck up as a company for a measly 2% of all funds. Similarly if you have a USD balance in GDAX it is Insured just like the FDIC so that is solid. 
But...if someone hacks your email or your 2FA with Coinbase you are fucked. There is no insurance claim process, this is not an FDIC backed account. You end up shit out of luck, go pedal this fake new elsewhere. 
Arguably, one of the biggest issues of scale are getting average users to understand the risk and lock their accounts down as strongly as possible, understand that Coinbase is not a bank,m they facilitate your buy/sell and make a profit for the convenience. 
Someone could start a company that insures every bitcoin deposited into their coffers and build a great business to help the average individual as we scale this thing. 
I think you should take a deep breath and understand hardware wallets give you an extra layer of security. Bitcoin is buying houses, cars, plane tickets, vacations, coffees, and more. What percent of those merchants only accept BTC?
Chill. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:37:50
GDAX is Coinbase's exchange. Use the same login you have for Coinbase and avoid paying fees by buying BTC with a limit order instead of a market order.

Bitcoin has the potential to change the world. You should read the Satoshi white paper and look at Nick Szabo's blog Unenumerated. 
Bitcoin creates a globally distributed network that allows a decentralized monetary system to function via code and computer power. 
You do not need a bank to send you money to another person or merchant, you just do it via your own wallet - you're really. Evening your own bank. 
Bitcoin itself is of course made of code and a key function is the underlying "blockchain" which is a triple public ledger allowing any transaction to be looked up for confirmation. 
Security is key. Bitcoin itself is arguably the most secure financial network in the world in the sense that double spending your coins (aka fraud) is almost nil. Look up how much money any major credit card company loses each year to fraud. Any key is that transactions can not be reversed, once you send our coins off, they are on their way. 
Then you have the speed of transactions being confirmed. Compare a purchase in Bitcoin to a credit card or debit card. With Bitcoin the transaction will be approved sometime today depending on how high or low of a fee is included for the miners ( the computer power) to confirm the transaction. Banks take 3-4 days or sometimes longer to actually clear a transaction and put money in a bank account and then it takes a couple more days for the transaction to clear fully into your account, so it can take longer than a week to have your hands on YOUR money. Crazy. 
And then BTC is still revolving and growing with developers who are writing code and updating the platform so it can continue to compete (dominate?) the space.

Totally understand the mindset which is good. Knowing BTC is volatile, you want to take advantage of that. 
The problem is when your trades do not manifest themselves. With limit capital, you are only able to swing trade bitcoin if it increases in value. 
Whereas a hedge fund with $10+ million for BTC trading can take both sides of a bet. They make money on bitcoin increasing in value and decreasing in value. 
This is something you can not take advantage of. There can be long stretches where BTC is down and your capital is already invested so you can't even take advantage of the pullback. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:13:21
I'm pretty sure Coinbase is not trying to sign random people up. They've got their hands full integrating new users from the explosion of interest in BTC. 
You probably have a friend who is trolling you because of the way you dismiss Coinbase. 99% having fun on how you are reacting to the mysterious circumstance.

Why are you worried about waiting 11 days? If you are not already verified there's not much you can do to love the needle. 
Get verified on a bunch of exchanges, transfer your fiat over, and wait to buy when it makes sense to. 
You should add your credit card or whatever additional information Coinbase is asking for. Then your total buy amount will increase because they trust you are not fraudulently buying BTC. 
About 10% of Coinbase's revenue is sucked up by fraud. They want to make sure they don't add to an already big problem.

The internet bubble in the early 2000's did pop but you are forgetting that it has evolved even stronger than it was before with real companies generating real revenue. 
I think of bitcoin/the blockchain as a force like the Internet in the early to mid 1990s. You know this is going to be a hugely powerful thing, you just don't quite know how it is going to shake out in reality. 
The internet has allowed companies to build an ecosystem on top of itself to relate value and the crypto space will be able to do the same.

People act like BTC will never dip below 5817 EVER AGAIN. now it's 2:38 am and we are sitting at 5514. 
If you have confidence that you can significantly increase your BTC fucking do it. Sure you may have to pay some taxes and you may not sell at the ATH and buy at the bottom of the dip but if you get it relatively close, you'll do fine and long term you'll make more money. 
I didn't the math today from the last dip and I was awake and watching exchanges. I could have increase my holding 40-60% but I had to go outside in Indonesia and didn't have cell signal so my inspiration to sell around 5k didn't happen. So I kept holding but if you do it once a year or whatever and hit long term gains, who cares?

Everyone that is serious about crypto wants to see the day every merchant accepts crypto as well. If it happens, our BTC will be worth a lot more than it is today. 
Yet it is also like saying every American should eat a balanced diet and do 30 push ups a day. Just because you want it to be reality, doesn't make it so. 
Why am I using BTC? I presume we've both read the whitepaper and see potential in massive world change. 
You know, Coinbase is quite literally responsible for every user on their platform, just like Bank of America is responsible for all accounts regardless of value. 
Coinbase should only increase a person's buying power after they setup 2FA and lock their account down well. You get hacked because nefarious criminals decide to target you and Coinbase because it works due to a lack of security measures that users should be forced to adopt. 
For the world to see the scale and growth of BTC as you see it, you need to have security that works for people with millions and non tech savvy normal people with $50, $300, $2,000 in their "bank account" with Coinbase. 
I've used Coinbase just as long as you and it's fine but it is absolutely not perfect. Additionally Coinbase allows you to earn $10 of BTC for referrals who purchase $100 of BTC - you're helping them toe their business and they are rewarding you. 
And Coinbase does not share their keys with you anymore. They ended the miltisig wallet you're talking about, so that is not true (

I took action on doing this. Waiting for the ledger to arrive in the mail and playing with sending from CoinBase to GreenAddress just to be sure I have the process down 100%.
I've been hodling my coins with Coinbase for years because it has been easy to see the value and the *sexy* ux. Today is the day I took back full control of my coins after letting this advice go in one ear and out the other. 
Thank you for your *specific* suggestion to help spur action!
One question I have - is there a way to avoid fees when transferring from Coinbase to GreenAddress? Or will there just always be a small fee to the miner for confirming the transaction?
It seems that is you own the coins in one wallet, it should be free to move them to another wallet you own. Any clarification is helpful, thanks again!
