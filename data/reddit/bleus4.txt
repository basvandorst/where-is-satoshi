Good point! Me saying low/high was really just meant in relative terms, and while I know that means what is high relatively could be low in the grand scheme of things, it's the easiest way of looking at it since as you say we can't know where the cap is.

Hadn't thought about that, sounds like a really good method actually! Will do this I think.

Sorry for assuming anything, it's just that so many people on Reddit are Americans, so I wanted to clarify that business school part in that case (since as I understand, I should know much of this stuff if I had attended an American business school).
I will go and put that post in a tab, a bit too late to read now, but it's definitely something I'll do. I mean I would be stupid not to, you sound like you have tons of experience and expertise in the field, and while I can't say I find all of this as interesting as that I would dedicate so much time to it (at least not yet), it is still an interesting venue.

Thanks for the offer! Have a good night (or morning haha?)

Thanks for the feedback, that sounds very reasonable and in line with some of the stuff I learned at business school (I live in Denmark so I don't know how to translate it directly, but it was basically high school with many business related classes). I can't invest that much since I'm without a source of income right now, but maybe I could do something like $100.
Btw, what is the best place to buy Bitcoin?

Interesting. I'm a newb at cryptocurrency and investing in general, so even though I have a background at a business school (In Denmark, so it's quite different from the US, not as comprehensive and deep), many of these terms and sayings don't make complete sense to me. I still think I understand most of what you're saying at least :p

Can you ELI5?

Thanks for the advice, I think I'll invest soon but perhaps I'll wait a couple of weeks to see if there during that time period is any major development.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:15:57
For sure!
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:19:58
You have a good link for that? :p I know I could find something myself, but there's so much to read about that I'm afraid to get overwhelmed, and I obviously also want the info to actually be good/useful.

Just tagging along your comment to ask, is *now* a good idea to jump into Bitcoin investing? I haven't invested in cryptocurrency before, but the last couple of months I've had somewhat of an interest in buying some (percentage) of Bitcoin, the only thing keeping me back is that I know it's stupid to buy high. Now it has fallen a lot though right, so I assume it potentially could be profitable to jump aboard the train while it's still at somewhat of a low?

It's definitely noted my man, I've gotten tons of super useful advice from many people here, which I'm VERY thankful for, believe me that :) I'll research and read up on lot's of stuff the next pair of weeks, so I can see if this is something for me and so that I'm well prepared to dip my toes in it. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:13:59
Thanks, will take a look at it right now :)
