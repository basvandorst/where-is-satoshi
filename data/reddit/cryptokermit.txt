Be nice to the costumers.

Because it's been massively undervalued since day one and still is.

You will probably need to sue him directly for compensation.
I found this page that suggests these people should be contacted to report fraud in Canada: 
THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE (RCMP - Mounties)
THE NATIONAL WHITE COLLAR CRIME CENTRE OF CANADA (NW4C)
PHONEBUSTERS (Canada)
If you make complaints with these three entities and follow up diligently you have a good chance of having an investigation and presumably some charges pressed against him. Once the criminality has been established it should be trivial to sue for damages.  Until these types of crooks see some consequences this will keep happening to people.

The entire contents of the article you linked. You got a big short going or what?

For that money I would get a pc with a few nice graphics cards and mine some promising alts.

What country? Usually it goes: Go to police and press charges then have a lawyer sue for damages.

My pleasure - hope it all goes well for you. I hate that btc attracts these kind of scum. I really hope he gets whats coming to him.

It's like a magnet for pieces of shit. I love the tech but hate the leaders in the community. I think it may well get supplanted by a vastly technically superior new type of crypto based on quantum secured networks.

If you just want a btc miner I think it's best to save your monies for the GMO ico for 7nm mining machines. If you want one now then yeh the s9, you'll still have to wait a while tho. If you want best bang for your buck go with graphics cards and mine alts. Look at some profitability calcs to see if it's worth ur while.

You should totally give it to them, maybe in a way that they can't touch it for a few years. 1 btc in ten years will hopefully mean total financial independence. You really can't give a better gift than that.

I don't think it will be this way forever. Next gen wireless tech + meshing and quantum networks are going to change the way we communicate forever and end telecom company monopolies. Hell you can launch a micro satellite these days for under 100k. It's going to take time but things will certainly not be this way forever. There's many clever people working in the space with similar concerns to yours.

The crypto that takes btc's mantle as premier store of value will have it's own separate infrastructure IMO. It's probably closer than you think.

It's FUDderiffic

We're still arguably in the early adopter phase. Volatility should decrease as the network matures.
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:13:29
This is a huge problem. It's very possible btc will be supplanted by a technically superior alt with a fairer distribution model. 
Even though btc is technically good and has the most mature network, I don't think normal people will want to put their money into a system where a fat fingered early adopter can crash the price back to $1 if they want. 
Especially since a lot of large holders have proven themselves to be total scumbags.

By definition speculation requires investment. So no.

most likely it's a ponzi
