They aren't making the exchange to further crypto or so we can buy groceries with it, it's there for them to turn a profit on big investors. All this does is give another avenue for big money to manipulate the price and further drive it into speculative stock like investing. I think this may be a bad thing.

not to mention, how do you pay for a big mac when the value of btc changes so quickly. Is it worth .1 or .2 today?   I'm all for the idea of btc as a currency but i don't understand how it will work if the value changes so much.

For those of you trading occasionally, how do you keep track of your trades? App? Spreadsheet? I was using block folio but it doesn't have the Australian exchanges I use so listed prices are coming up wrong as I'm buying above the listed price in the app but in a dip on the exchange.
What are some alternatives? Particularly ones that allow you to put profits from a sale into holding (but still part of the portfolio).

Looking at bitfenix, nearly every single crypto has losses in the 15 - 20% or more range. Are we getting some foul play here? wheres all the sale equity moving to?

I tried to make one my self but man it's hard to track last in first out! What does yours look like? Mind sharing?

Coincidentally I sold most of the stuff I've used for swing trading at around 8% loss. So I'll buy in again at 16% rise. I like that strategy, did you learn that from somewhere?
