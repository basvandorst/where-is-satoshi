Where do I use -onlynet=onion ?
Should I be seeing incoming connections as well?

When looking at peers in the debug window on Bitcoin Core, all eight read an IP:8333.
OS is Windows
Tor expert bundle is Tor without the browser, if I my understanding is correct.

Thanks for your reply. This seems like good info and I've come across this page before but it doesn't get me anywhere.
For example: "The following directions assume you have a Tor proxy running on port 9050" - I don't know how to test that.
"In a typical situation, this suffices to run behind a Tor proxy:
./bitcoind -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050" - Where does bitcoind come from and how do I apply this setting to it?
Step 3 talks about Tor version 0.2.7.1 and above being able to set up hidden service automatically and provides commands such as -listen, -listenonion=0, -torcontrol and -torpassword but it doesn't say where these commands are supposed to be used. I've tried Bitcoin Cores console and they don't work there.
So this seems like good info but has no guidance on how to use it.

When you look at peers, are they all .onion nodes or a mix?

When running core and Tor on Windows and Ubuntu, I couldn't get onion peers exclusively. I don't know why.

That has worked a treat! All my outgoing connections are now onion nodes.
If I can get incoming working too, that means I can connect to my own node from another wallet right?

I have a 200Mbps connection, it was done in roughly 10 hours.

Thanks for your reply, the info from that link seems to be outdated. Do you run your own node over Tor?

Two of the links on that page redirected, one link is the same as another user commented which seems to have good info but no instruction on how to use it. I am getting the feeling everything mentioned is specifically for Linux based systems such as bitcoind and commands starting with a dash. Mainly because bitcoin-qt and bitcoind are both executables from the bitcoin core windows installer rather than the Linux style of running programs.
Like I said, my technical skills are basic and some things that may be obvious to others I simply haven't learnt yet. I hope to get this working, I think it's a worthwhile challenge.

I got a setup like [this]( sorted but I think it's a problem with connecting through port 8333. I have added a rule in windows firewall and my router but still when I [check]( if its open I get a negative back. 
I'm pretty sure I now have the hidden service running and I'm fairly sure it's gonna be the right setup. I got my onion address but Bitcoin Core won't connect with it.
Any thoughts?

I appreciate your replies.
I haven't used bitcoind, I have only used bitcoin-qt because of the easy gui. I don't know what I'm doing with command line and it seems like I need a fair bit more understanding to get there.

Should bitcoin.conf been empty before I add that command?
