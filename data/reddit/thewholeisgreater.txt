It's only a matter of time before you'd be put back in there anyway. With that in mind could you at least go in there and flesh out the details a bit? 
If this is going to be a proper entry we need to know every single even *slightly* controversial event in your life to date including (but not limited to) jilted ex-girlfriends, frivolous lawsuits and hilarious wardrobe malfunctions.

Hook me up bro. You already ruined my 'BTC for Cammed Movies Distributed Over Thousands of Floppy Disks' business, I think it's the least you can do.

Well I can't compete with that. God-damn immigrants, coming over here and working for nothing...

What are you, some kind of Nigerian prince?

Send me BTC and I'll 'legally acquire' whatever movie you want and send it to you as an email attachment. Sound good?

Dayum. Sherlocked his ass.

My first changetip :'-)
Now I just wait until BTC hit's the mythical 10k and I'll be laughing all the way to the bank!

Isn’t there a huge problem with crypto miners moving next to places with hydroelectric power, using up all the energy and driving up the price for locals without providing any jobs or anything cause the infrastructure requires so few bodies to maintain?
