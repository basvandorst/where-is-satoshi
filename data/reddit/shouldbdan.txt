Same with BTC-e. Might be shady, but they're keeping their funds secure.

He means what % of Bitfinex's Bitcoin holdings.

That's not debt; that's equity.

Dorian Nakamoto was Hal’s neighbor. Google Dorian for more.

Back in August, was trying to figure out how to move coins from a paper wallet onto a Blockchain.info wallet. He tried to import the wallet to Blockchain.info and was having trouble with it: 
According to the [pastebin]( he was testing moving some of the coins in August and then decided to move the rest in November. While was struggling to import the paper wallet in August, he said he [eventually figured out how to import it using bitaddress.org](
Here's what I think happened:
Somewhere in trying to figure out how to import an address, he put in a public address from one of his wallets somewhere, either into bitaddress.org or blockchain.info, and it was interpreted as a private key (after SHA256). For example, bitaddress.org has a brain wallet feature which has the words "compressed address?" [right there as a checkbox next to the passphrase input]( Maybe he put in a public address (thinking it was a private key) as the passphrase for a brain wallet while fiddling with the compressed/uncompressed address feature (as he said he was doing in [this comment]( This generated a private key for him which then he was able to import into blockchain.info.
Presto! He now has manually imported an address which is easy to compromise into his blockchain.info. He did this in August and didn't end up using it until November, when the pastebin guy swiped it with his bot.

Do we have a way to know this account is connected to the Twitter account?
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:51:31
Are all of those Satoshi ones still sitting in the original addresses, or have some of them been moved? If so, is there a graph showing which ones have been moved and which are still there?

Are any of the suspected Satoshis known to have a birthday on or around April 5?

But if you have losses in the same year they can be used to offset your gains.
Then again, anyone who has gains to offset this year is doing a way better job than me.
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:48:47
Yeah, like what? I'm lost. Who is the other guy in the conversation and why does he say he can get a private key from a transaction and has papers on it? What? Is CW not right that that's bullshit?
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:33:44
I just did my own poking around. Hal Finney was born May 4. That's 5/4 in American ordering. April 5 would be 4/5. Coincidence?

Was reminded, nothing here. Guess I'll come back later.

Taxes, man. Unless you think this individual would try to skip out on paying taxes? Surely not.

Short of actually signing an early block (which no one who isn't actually Satoshi will be able to do), having *these* particular people vouch for you is about the best proof you could possibly have. How could someone possibly top that in the future?
@_date: 2016-05-06 04:49:29
Gavin hasn't backed down yet, either... which is super interesting to say the least.
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:35:23
I'm not sure, but that scenario is highly unlikely. The OP I was responding to was envisioning a future where lots of Satoshis crawl out of the woodwork without any cryptographic proof. I was pointing out that short of cryptographic proof, CSW has provided the best possible proof anyone could provide.

WTF, Karpeles looks like an adult now. How many years have passed?
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:18:26
How long have we known about this Vinnik guy? I thought BTC-e was run by secret shadow people.
@_date: 2016-07-22 05:25:57
It's definitely not half the nodes. said yesterday it was around 10%. I've heard that it's even less today.
