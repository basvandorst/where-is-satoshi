I can't believe no one is talking about dogecoin after it has been steadily rising while all other cryptos have been falling this week. Also last night the cap of Dogecoin was 13 million, this morning 19 million. 
Here take a look for yourself

You mean you invested other people's money?

Mt. Gox stands for Magic the Gathering Online eXchange. Humor might have some relationship to value in that Bitcoin was just as much a joke. A thriving community is a requisite to having a high velocity which is only possible through Doge, where as bitcoin and lite coin have low velocity since everyone just wants to sit on them and hope theyll grow. 
Good luck out there friend. 
Edit: by the way many people on Bitcoin understand bitcoin could still lose it value due to the fact that one of the clones might come out on top. N

BTC is experiencing some serious bounces and huge resistance at 400. I dont know if i should be upset yet that i didnt jump on the $420 coins.

Do you mean its here to stay, or its not going anywhere as in its going to stall?
Either way, i always play the who knows card. I cant justify myself saying its going to crash or boom. Its seems more like, to me, it will have a few more boom cycles. Why? Well It seems to be a trend thats really all I have.

Well as its being said now is probably not the best time to buy then again who know, but i've really been enjoying Kraken's interface. I'm hoping the volume will increase these next few days.

To be fair, it *was* impossible wasn't it?
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:34:36
Its not a "stretch" because what this back and forth is trying to demonstrate is that defining was is "likely" in this situation is near impossible. 
For all anyone knows 10K may even be a conservative estimate.

Here have some, there not as valuable as bitcoin per coin but I see some healthy competition in terms of market cap happening in the future.
+250 doge

You know whats funny about this, you guys are such assholes you didnt even realize hes being sarcastic.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:02:42
I got to admit i was cynical about tipping doge in here but hey if you want some...
+1000 doge verify

Again this thread of comments is highlighting that this very same sentiment could have been said when it was around a dollar. You could have easily said a year ago:
"There is virtually nothing that could justify a $1k price tag by the end of the (arbitrary time stamp). Technologies which enhance bitcoin's usability / functionality can only be developed so quickly"
These booms have nothing to do with the tech or even the infrastructure, they seem, so far, to be speculative booms that have been and will always be a part of the game. This is not a solid form of justification but it is a piece of the puzzle that does have substance on the price.

I mean why not? The word is so freaking unpredictable. Maybe another round of countries adopts BTC and bam we achieve 100 billion market cap... Say a whole country in crisis adopt BTC as an official currency and were at a trillion.... I mean... why not?
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:10:22
noticed your getting downvoted here. Hopefully this'll take the sting off if there is any.
+125 doge 
@_date: 2014-01-17 21:45:31
Maybe give people doge coins to introduce them to cryptos. Easier, less risk, and friendly community. Now that they have bitcoins they can trade them easily.

According to some almost identical charts we wont blast off for another 2 months. So you have time to get ready!
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:54:36
Anything is possible but I think a lot of people are going to look at the chart, see the 1200 dollar peak, and think to themselves, "bitcoins are cheap right now."

This is what people are still not understanding. They're blaming you for this blowing up but it actually serves to inform people of a major current event that clearly many of you would like to know about. 
Your hardcores have pulled a sort of veil over a very decent investment opportunity out of pure fear. To me its sounds like an attempt to censor and silence competition.
