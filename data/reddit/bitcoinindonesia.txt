Fungible means your newly printed US$ 100 bill has the same value with my old crumpled US$ 100 bills or US$ 100 balance in my bank.
Your US$ 100 also have the exact same value with my two US$ 50 bills.
If we use banana as currency, your banana may not have the same quality and taste with my banana. Thus banana is not fungible.

Fractional Reserve Banking is still possible with bitcoin. If you “save” your money in bitcoin “Bank” (this “bank” give you certificate of deposit or promissory notes instead of private key) and the “Bank” then lend out your bitcoin to someone else, that's fractional reserve banking.

Credit Card is common digital payment system in USA and the use of Credit Card already widespread there. So I guess, US people are reluctant to use unstable currency like bitcoin.
Unlike USA, in my country not so many people using Credit Card. Because applying Credit Card is somewhat difficult for average people — Guess what, I applied credit card for 5 times and all rejected by Bank — Also Indonesian people think that using Credit Card is not safe for online transactions.
For Online transaction, they prefer to use Bank Transfer. Whether it is Internet Banking, SMS Banking or using ATM. It is stupid for Facebook, Google, WhatsApp selling their product in Indonesia and wants to get paid with credit card or even PayPal LoL... They will not get much market from Indonesian people.
The problem arise when they want to pay overseas merchant such as eBay, Amazon, buying Android Apps. Without credit card it's almost impossible. Most merchant only accept credit card and PayPal. It is common for PayPal balance traded over the counter here.

To make things clear, although most Indonesian are moslem. I don't think Indonesia is Islamic country like in Middle East. Here we don't use Sharia Law except in Aceh.
Just like TheHatTrick said, here is country with big diversity. People are nice and willing to help you without you asking them.
Also you will not prosecuted just because you are an atheist. You are welcome not to believe any god, de facto. But keep that belief for yourself. Don't invite others to become atheist or spread atheism. You will prosecuted if you spread atheism or held an atheist gathering.
They are many Gay and Transgender here. You will not killed by mob nor prosecuted just because you are Gay. But Gay and Transgender tend to have very bad social stigma here. No one willing to be your friend if you confess you are Gay.
Things that you don't have freedom here is freedom of speech. Especially when it comes to religion of peace. Criticizing it will result in anger (frequent), prosecution by police (somewhat frequent), and yeah... you could get killed by a mob (rare).

When you use Electrum, make sure:
• Keep your backup safe. Electrum use 'seed' for backup. It is 12 secret words to recover your balance in case your computer get broken or lost.
• Keep your computer safe. Malware disguised as fancy games can stole your wallet. Be careful of what you install. Keep your anti virus software up to date. It is recommended that you use Mac OS X or GNU/Linux.

The value of your home will still rise but may not as significant as in inflationary economy.
For example, if the deflationary rate is 2% per year and your home value rise 10% a year. You still have 8% price increase every year. Bank will only fund real estate mortgage that increase in value outpacing deflationary rate. Low quality and bad real estate will not get funded using mortgage, you either buy it now with your own dime or save.
Also deflationary economy punish borrower and reward saver. People tend to save than borrow. More saver than borrower result in low interest rate. The interest rate will be near zero.

Also keep in mind, Bank make money by offering credit from those who save money to those who need money. As a saver you get interest from your saving as risk compensation.
This money lending business will still exist even in Bitcoin Economy. The difference is, there is no interest rate set by central bank, no Bail Out, no Printing more money.

Hi, If you can use Reddit, I am pretty sure you can use Bitcoin. Just start with small amount to avoid unnecessary risk.
Bitcoin is stored on cloud, your balance is stored on a cloud database called BlockChain (not to be confused with BlockChain.info wallet)
Only those who have a secret code called Private Key can claim a balance of a bitcoin address.
(1) Yes you can store these Private Key on your computer or on your phone. But make sure you made a backup and no one have access to your computer and smartphone.
(2) If you store these private key on websites, you entrust your bitcoin with that website. They are many website that provide this service such as Blockchain.info, Coinbase, CoinKite, BitGo. A good rule of thumb is to use these service only for everyday use. You may use these bitcoin web wallet services for the first time you bought and spend bitcoin. But the more you learn about bitcoin, you will also learn how to do good security practice.
(3) I don't know. Theft are depends on how good your security practice.
(4) Because these secret code (private key) are so secret, people usually encrypt it. If you lost the encryption password, you and everyone else can't claim the Balance. Your bitcoin are lost forever, just like you burn a bank note. The number is still there but can't be sent to any address.
(5) cold storage is physical bitcoin. You wrote these secret code (private key) on a media such as paper or a file on a DVD.

I don't understand technically how bitcoin protocol work in depth.
As far As I know, the network fee are charged to the sender. Not receiver.
If I have a bitcoin address and you send to me 1 bitcoin. It doesn't matter whether you sent me 1 bitcoin from just one address or you sent me 0.001 bitcoin from 1000 address. The fee are always charged to you.
I assume I received that 1 bitcoin if there is some confirmations on my bitcoin address. Do I have to pay more fee when I try to spent that 1 bitcoin that comes from 1000 different address? CMIIW
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:17:20
Hell yeah... way to rub salt in the wound buddy
For average common people like your grandma, they don't know what wallet seed nor private key is. They better entrust their bitcoin to somebody more expert at technical stuff. Unfortunately this called ‘Trusted’ body is unworthy to be trusted.
Even ThomasV loss more than 100 bitcoins on Empty Gox. Of course, it's unlikely for Electrum wallet creator to use Empty Gox as a Bank. Just unfortunate event for him selling bitcoin on Empty Gox.
Yes they are Bitstamp, BTC-e and even BTC China. But so far only Empty Gox provide many currency choice with real volume, other Exchange simply don't have.

You are right, most of the time cash payment is still the preferred method here. But you can't send cash for online payment. It takes days and lost prone. And people tend to use debit/ATM card instead of credit card.
Many people here have bring more than one mobile phone. We already have local Bitcoin Market &amp; Exchanger here. It's a lot easier than before to buy and sell Bitcoin in Indonesia now.

Yes, to be honest I would prefer to pay using fiat for everyday purchase. Why do I need to bother buy bitcoin first instead of paying directly with my money in wallet? Also no one accept bitcoin in the place where I live now, the only way I can spend bitcoin is on the Internet.
It is a different story while I need to pay something on the Internet especially paying international merchant. I don't have any credit card. Bitcoin is really lifesaver.

I am sorry, but people choose what implementation they run. They define Bitcoin. Seems that your core cult already losing support from people. By the time the hard fork happened, your so called altcoin become the new Bitcoin. Either you use the new Bitcoin or stay with your ideology.
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:54:46
It is the miners and users who decide to implement Satoshi Nakamoto proposal and gives Bitcoin value. Many altcoins out there have better features than Bitcoin. Yet Bitcoin is the most valuable and most used cryptocurrency, you know why? The miners and users! So please, don't blame the people how silly their decision is. Without them, Bitcoin is nothing!
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:07:41
Theoretically yes. As long as majority of it's user, miners, developer, and investors agree. It's called consensus. And I don't mind if the consensus says that 21 million coins is not enough. Bitcoin is not the money defined by Satoshi Nakamoto alone nor by some 'experts' calling themselves Core developers or central banker board of directors who claim they know better than everyone.

@_date: 2016-01-19 15:55:08
It is not the hard fork that make bitcoin worthless. It is the user who don't want to use Bitcoin anymore that make bitcoin have no value at all. Why do you think Bitcoin is the most valuable Cryptocurrency? is it because no sh!t coins are better than Bitcoin or because it is the most used cryptocurrency by people? No matter how sophisticated your Bitcoin is, if no one use it, your bitcoin will have no value. Get some real and wake up from your ideology.
In Austrian school of economics —which lays the foundation of ideal money used by Bitcoin— value is subjective. For a bunch monkeys, banana is more valuable than gold. No matter how you explain to them how beauty gold is.

And please note that if you are success (i.e. everyone do the same thing like you) Your so called altcoin become real bitcoin.

You are no different than using traditional fiat currency.

By the time hard fork activated, at least 75% of Nodes and miners are supporting 2 MB. And I am pretty sure, my SPV wallet will chose the longest chains. I can also do manual check which nodes I connected. Also, most people in my country are using web wallet which will automatically choose majority of nodes and miners.
To use SegWit, you need to upgrade all Bitcoin wallet on earth. 2MB Hard Fork, you only need to upgrade all nodes and miners.

Same here. When I tried to pay someone using bitcoin. They are asking higher price to compensate price volatility. So the buyer (me) prefer to pay using local currency.
For what it's worth you need to buy bitcoin first with your national currency then you pay the seller using bitcoin. The seller then convert back again your bitcoin to national currency. Why not paying directly using national currency? Using national currency is far more efficient in this case (day to day transaction). Unless you pay online small amount of money over different countries that use different currency, bitcoin has big advantage in this case. People choose to use bitcoin if it provide more efficient way to transact (which is unfortunately not your daily real life transaction).
