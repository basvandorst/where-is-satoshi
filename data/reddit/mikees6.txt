It means that, if nobody changes their sell orders, the buyers would have to buy 300BTC before any sell order above 12k would sell, ie., before the price could rise over 12k. Of course, if the price starts to rise quickly, some of those people with 12k sell orders will cancel them, and maybe set new, higher, sell orders (maybe helping create a new, higher, sell wall).

Could you elaborate on "This is all because uk banks will under no circumstances accept bitcoin businesses as customers". If I open an account with an exchange that accepts UK bank transfers as deposits (BitStamp?) and I transfer to them, is that a problem, since I am the bank's customer, not the exchange?

Been watching since late 2017, Jan/Feb this year noticed that the barts were disappearing, noticed the build up of institutional investment (investment, not just interest), noticed that the whale wallets were accumulating. So basically the same as you, figured it had to be a good time to take a punt, been buying in ever since.
I think there is a bit of merit to some TA on a short time-scale (like at the moment $11K seems a good support level), but it is mostly bullshit click bait.

Ignore trig9118, typical cheap-shot straw-man response. Yeh, I agree, there are repeated dumps but each time, the price moves up again. This has happened in the past (it was one reason I started buying in around $3500) and it didn't stop the longer-term rise.

Lots of mumblings here about whales and price manipulation, so having just got back from sheltering from a downpour under the branches of a solid English Oak, with time to to cogitate on the ways of the world, here are my thoughts, for whatever they are worth.
Someone earlier today commented about "someone worth $30b chucks $200m at BTC like it’s nothing". $30b is definitely exaggerated, but 50K BTC is about $100M so lets go with that. Consider the whale; consider his ways. The whale cannot unload that 50K BTC because there is just not enough liquidity. Try that and a lot of other people will unload as well and the price will go to, well, somewhere near zero. Game over, requiem Bitcoin. The whale has the means to pump and dump to increase BTC or yield USD, and at the moment it looks like the Bart is back in fashion, and why not, but compared to that 100K BTC it is peanuts.
What does the whale really want, longer term. The whale wants a highly liquid market, so he can, eventually, unload significant quantities. The higher the price the better, obviously. But to get that high liquidity, the whale needs more people willing to buy and sell BTC. If the whale drives the price down too far, then that will frighten off too many people, and most of that 50K BTC it for practical purposes worthless.
So, I'm not going to say what the local price bottom will be (OK, so just before the drop to $9049 I said "Bottom is $9242 plus/minus a couple of dollars" and it bounced at $9234 on Bitstamp so I was quite chuffed with that) but I really don't believe the $4K-and-a-bit predictions because that is too much in the no-recovery death-zone ("Well, Bitcoin had one last go at a new ATH, but it really looks like game over now"). Personally I'm betting on $9200 (which just happens to be the prophecy, but that's coincidence, well almost, honest), but nothing lower that about $7600. The whales won't allow it.
Anyway, even the stout English Oak was unable to resist the torrent, so time to go and dry off properly. Have a nice day.

@_date: 2019-07-30 12:59:23
This. Its basically the risk/reward calculation. So the reward on winning the lottery is greater but the risk is even more so. OTOH, Bitcoin (in my opinion, others may disagree) offers a reward that is many times greater than any other investment (ie., other than out-and-out gambling) at a risk that makes it worth staking some GBP on.
Plus, if Bojo and his merry men have their way, GBP will likely tank against USD, making my BTC worth even more. Every clod\[\*\] has a silver lining.
\[\*\] No, that is not a typo.

TL;DR; I should have been more explicit about the yellow price line.
Its a bit difficult to tell exactly on the bitcoinity chart, but the yellow line, and the limits of the green and red areas look to be sampled twice per day, at midday and midnight. Yellow is the price at that moment; green upper and red lower are the highest and lowest prices over a 12 hour period.  Expanding the relevant day to 5-minute candles (I used tradingview) showed that the price around midday and then around midnight  (UTC) were both about $13000 with the peak in-between (and troughs).
So unless the yellow price was sampled exactly at the peak it would not show $13,764; exactly when in the day it was sampled makes a lot of difference.
@_date: 2019-07-03 09:41:12
Adding to reply. If you notice, generally when the price is falling the yellow line is at the bottom of the spread (so people are submitting market sell orders which are matched by the limit buys - the buy price), and vice-versa when the price is rising.

FWIW, the last couple of weeks look a lot like a similar period between $7K-$9K. So I reckon the price will wobble around $10.5K-$11K for a few days, then set off up again.

Asked my UK accountant about it this very morning. Coin left on an exchange (even traded back and forth there if you have stops set) can be accounted as Capital Gains; HMRC is interested just in deposits into, and withdrawals from, the exchange. This was my reading of the HMRC web page on the subject,
If you use a wallet, and just use the exchange for coin/fiat transactions, then I can't see that HMRC would know.

You are right that if trust is lost and the mainstream pulls out, it will be a bubble that crashes, and yes, that may well happen.

I think someone can say "I can afford to lose X amount" and then bail out at a loss without being contradictory; it just means that they were dipping their feet in the water on the off-chance of a quick profit, and then lose interest. It does have the useful side effect of transferring value into the pot :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:14:53
You deposit some fiat currency with the exchange (and/or some coins you already have). The exchange then holds those on your behalf. Say you then buy some bitcoin. The exchange just notes that your fiat balance has gone down and your bitcoin balance has gone up (and charges you a small amount like 0.5%). Nothing actually moves; the exchange still has your fiat and your bitcoin. If you ever transfer some coin out (to another wallet), then the coin transfer fees will apply.

Even if "everyone is aware" (which I seriously doubt) there is still the problem that different people will have different views on the effect it will have. So, for instance, a bunch of might think "the Mt. Gox sale will drop the price by $200" (or whatever), but the actual effect is to drop the price by $250, and a bunch of those people think "shit, I got that wrong". So they quickly sell and the price drops like another $250. Or they think "I got that wrong, but not too much" and they hold. There is no way to know in advance.

What is it with a bunch of people? Do people not actually read what OP says? So many comments critical of OP for doing stuff he isn't doing, or situations he is not in. FFS.
My view, go for it. Worst case scenario you lose an amount that is small compared to what your lifetime savings could plausibly be; best case scenario you make a lot. This is the thing about Bitcoin at the moment, the risk/reward ratio is massively skewed (risk in the trading sense of what you are prepared to lose). Most likely still a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Me, I'm at the other end, 62 years old. I have enough wealth to have a comfortable retirement, and the amount I can add before I retire is small compared to that. But, if I put that into Bitcoin, and it works out, my retirement becomes a whole lot nicer; if it doesn't, not so much different. So in a way, I'm now all-in, with whatever I can save in the next year or two.
So, good luck to OP (and good luck to me!).
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:48:40
I think maybe you are right about 4400 and shorts. The only question is whether a bunch of sell orders appear as people decide to take an profit (or maybe recover from an investment from say Oct 2017), call that the "Luxury Quilted" scenario, or alternatively, sell orders are pulled and getting a decent price becomes really hard. I think of that as the "Izal Medicated" scenario.

Yeh, that's the way I see it. So currently I have twice as much invested as I'm prepared to risk, with the proviso that if the price dropped to about $2000 then I'm out. Sort of like leverage, only funded by myself. I figure $2000 is **sooooo** unlikely (and if it did, my stops would kick in well before that) that its a win-win.

Over the 4 by 15 minute red candles (last being the big mother), bitstamp transacted about 1450 BTC and binance 7000 BTC, thats about 33million USD, so somewhere around 100million USD dumped altogether :)
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:13:37
You miss my point.
I believe (rightly or wrongly) that BTC will increase in value well above the current $4000-ish price in the medium term. On that basis I am accumulating BTC. But: I am not betting that it will not fall below $4000 before this. So I could just invest the $N I am prepared to risk, and HODL. If BTC falls to $0 I'm out of the game, if it goes up by a factor R then I get Rx$N (less whatever for not getting the exact top).
However, I will bet that it will not fall below $2000. Hence, I can invest $2N for the same risk. If it falls to $2000 then I'm out of the game, but if it goes up I get Rx$2N.
Also, I'm betting that should the price fall to $2000 then that will involve a sudden massive drop. By setting a stop that is well below the day-to-day price range I avoid getting involved in day-to-day, but have a good chance of not getting caught by that sort of drop, and I can then buy back in lower without exceeding my risk (I would lose some $ amount, but less than the $N risk, and would end up with more BTC).
Of course, its all more-or-less-well-informed guesswork, but it is not buy high/sell low; it is about maximising potential rewards for a certain managed risk.

The thing about that is it is only worth doing if "they" think that the price will in the long term go up.
So for a while "they" dump and then buy back cheap, and that works. But then it reaches a state where "they" dump and buy back at essentially the same price. How do "they" know when that state is reached, well "they" don't until they try it.
The last dump which stayed down for any significant time was about a month ago (Feb24), since then the price has come back up quite quickly each time, so if "they" are doing 2, then it is getting less profitable.

Late boomer here (ie., at the younger end of the range, I'm early 60s).
Most of my money is in a savings account. Given my relatively short remaining life expectancy (well, compared to someone in their 20s or 30s), and the need shortly to start working through those savings, the risk/reward ratio for other "conventional" investments does not look anything like as attractive.
On the other hand, pretty well all my income surplus between now and retirement is (unless something major changes) going into Bitcoin, because the potential risk (100% loss) is quite small compared to my savings, but the potential reward is significant compared to my savings.
So, you are right that boomers are more risk-averse, but actually with fair reason. On the other hand, at lot (likely most) boomers are likely too risk averse for their own good. Still, just like most people are stupid and pay for new cars that depreciate massively, the more savvy ones can take advantage.

I'm in much the same position as you, although I'm accumulating month on month.
If you believe there are going to me more ATH's and more big dips, and the aim is to maximize your US$ value around a high in the future, then the aim is to maximize your BTC holding (because whatever value BTC reaches, you get back that amount times your BTC holding). So, prior to that point, maximizing BTC is more important than maximising USD (of course, you will have to decide when "that pint" is, and you might wipe out in advance, but c'est la vie).
So, FWIW, here is my strategy. In recent history, BTC price has moved around slowly, but with large jumps up and down every so often (the Bart pattern). Currently, I hold BTC and I have a stop sell set at a price a bit below a large buy wall, which I adjust from time to time. If BTC price just wanders around, I ignore that, but I figure if the buy wall is breached then the price will drop noticeably further. When this happens, my sell stop gets triggered; I then set a stop buy somewhere above a sell wall (but hopefully below my sell price). When that sell wall is breached, the price pops up and my buy stop triggers and I buy back in. Rinse and repeat.
To date I'm a little up on BTC, but the important point is it protects me from big losses on big drops when I hold BTC and from big rises when I don't. Personally, I've set a minimum USD value I'm prepared to get out at, which is currently equivalent to BTC at about $2000/BTC (ie., I have like N USD invested at the moment, and I'll call it a day at N/2 USD); but I reckon that if BTC did fall by 50%, for a lot of that 50% I'd be in USD, so I'm protected and can stay in the game longer.
Disclaimer: if you follow this and lose all your money, we are both idiots and I am not liable.

This is right. Clearly, when the bitcoin block chain was originally implemented, it was necessary to pick some size, which happened to be 1MB. Beyond that you either (a) go with the BCash argument that increased block size improves performance without sacrificing too much security or (b) go with the BTC argument which is the reverse, or maybe (c) that you could decrease the blocksize.
I imagine that the original 1MB was something of a finger-in-the-wind sort of choice. It seems to have been fine with BTC so far as security is concerned, while scaling issues are better handled by something like lightening. So, yes, the onus would be to justify increasing it and focusing on one particular number is pointless.

He's referring to the efficient market hypothesis, the idea that the price of something (in this case BTC) reflects all currently known information about that something. So, since everyone knows about the Mt. Gox situation, that has no effect.
Actually, the efficient market hypothesis is total bollocks, because it assumes that all information is known to everyone (it isn't) and that everyone acts rationally (they don't).

"In addition to being a legendary tech visionary and the man widely credited with having invented Ethernet, Bob Metcalfe was also a columnist for PC World sister publication InfoWorld. And it was in that column that Metcalfe made what must have been the most regrettable comment of his career; indeed, he even promised to eat his words if his augury turned out to be wrong.
To his credit, Metcalfe made good on that promise in 1999 during his keynote speech at the International World Wide Web Conference, where he blended up a copy of his printed column with some liquid and drank it down before a crowd of onlookers."

So then they have to manage lots and lots of addresses, and if they mess up they loose any funds for addresses that they loose. So another company comes along and offers to handle all that for them, and cover any losses, and charge some amount for the service, and the retailer says thanks and uses the service. Hmmm, what shall we call that sort of company .... I know, we'll call it a "Bank".
Don't get me wrong, I think Bitcoin and block chain are great, and the potential to transfer funds without third parties is great, but day to day stuff will move most transactions into the remit of what will be, effectively, banks.

@_date: 2018-06-13 10:16:36
Sure, unique addresses are easy to create, and bitcoin is easily transferred to that (public) address. But i someone (or a company) "forgets" or looses the private key, then they can no longer access the bitcoin stored at that address (think that guys hard drive in the landfill). So retailers are going to say, bitcoin fine, but we don't want to manage all those addresses ourselves, we want someone to do it for us, and we want them to cover any losses. And then a company (which may as well be known as a "Bank") will offer that service, and the retailers will go for it, just as they use Banks now.

In a word, liability (or, more colloquially, papering over your arse) (or ass if you are American). Companies will pay to offload responsibility to someone else, especially if that someone else offers guarantees. Also, addresses may be automatically generated, but you would still need to keep track of them, for instance for auditing. Again, companies will offload it, and "banks" will provide the service.

My view is, the whales will pump and dump to either accumulate BTC or yield USD. But, ultimately what they want is a high-liquidity high-value market. Without a high-liquidity market, their BTC are in reality worth a lot less than their nominal value, because they cannot sell significant amounts without tanking the market. So, while they wait, so to speak, they pump and dump, but they dare not do so to the point where they kill BTC for good. So if you HODL and don't sell at each pullback, your interests are the same as the whales.
Edit: typo.

For anyone new here: there are, to a reasonable approximation, three types of price-action posts on this sub.
There are the serious speculations, like "will Bakkt send prices up" or "will Tether printing send prices down", stuff like that. Lets face it, nobody really knows, but one reason humans have done well is that they can, often, predict the future with sufficient accuracy. So, speculation is what humans do. Read, consider, draw whatever conclusion you will.
There are the "when moon lambo" "we gonna be rich bois" posts. No doubt a few posters have faith in this with the fervour of the true believer, but mostly its a bit of fun. Read, smile, move on.
Then, there are the "you are all deluded idiots, bitcoin/crypto is gonna crash and burn, etc., etc." These people have no more idea than anyone else but they clearly get off on telling other people how bad things are going to turn out. Basically, ignore them, or, if you do reply, remember that you are really talking to all the other people reading this sub.

Absolutely. So, ref your earlier link [ and your comment "Not looking good that it's broken a long term trend" ....
The author of the chart says "So it seems to go down for a while again. But do not miss the point that is in a general lateral movement despite slightly downwards", which is something different. Had you commented on why the author is wrong, then fair enough, but without doing that, you have misrepresented what he said.
Extending the chart to the current time, it has broken a trend line, but that one started on 15th August, and I don't think that counts as a long term trend. The other upward trend line starts 17th July, which I guess might count as long term, but that trend has not been broken.

For the benefit of other people who are new to bitcoin (rather than OP).
A thing can have value if enough people agree that it has value. Gold has intrinsic value but it also has an agreed value - the agreed value fluctuates a certain amount, but enough people broadly agree enough that it can be used as a store of value.
Like gold, bitcoin has an agreed value. At the moment it fluctuates a lot more than gold (that is, the fiat price of bitcoin is said to be volatile) but, nevertheless, enough people agree enough for it also to be used as a store of value.
So, bitcoin may have neither intrinsic value nor redemption value, but that does not make it worthless.

I really don't get why people fail to understand this. Sure, the value of Bitcoin might go to zero (very unlikely, but possible), but the reward-to-risk ratio is huge, like once-in-a-lifetime huge. If I crash and burn I lose some money that I can afford to lose; if it works out then I get a shed load of profit. Especially true for me in my 60s, I have a limited time left to accumulate much in the way of "conventional" savings, but enough time to make a lot via Bitcoin, if it works out. And its a whole lot more likely than winning the lottery:)

Replying to everyone else.
The gap between the last two ATHs was four years; before that two-and-a-half years (unless you count the March 2013 peak), so 20 months since the last ATH is a lot less. Anyone who invested 20 months into either of the last two cycles (and, obviously, sold) would have done very nicely.
Note to say history has to repeat itself, but at this stage, holding offers a good chance of good returns.

I called the July 17th bottom [here]( .... on Bitstamp because that is about the Jan17/Feb18 closing/opening price, so maybe (s)he worked from that? And, here's something fascinating. The Bitstamp Dec17/Jan18 closing/opening price was $13880.00 (both, to the cent); and the Jul18 high was, guess what, $13880.00 (to the cent), so there are some spookey concidences there.
On the weekly chart, the close/open at the end of the first week of Jan18 was $16150 plus/minus a bit (and the highs in the weeks each side of the ATH were close to that), so I wonder if that is where the prophecy gets the Oct18 $16K from.
Where the next figures come from (if they come from anywhere) I have no idea.

Spot on. For me, if BTC went to zero, the loss would be relatively small; if it did anything like as well as the last cycle, I'll be very happy. Its not a sure think by any means, but the risk/reward ratio is fantastic.

Seems to me the whales want BTC to rise just as much as you and me, just they have the means to make some extra on the way there. Untimately, the more the whales hold, the lower the liquidity, and the less fiat inflow is needed to push the price. Sure, its scarey, but this has been going on since whenever, and BTC is, overall, still rising. Go with the flow, and the whales actually benefit the smaller hodlers in the long run.
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:23:54
To put it in perspective a bit, the last 24hr BTC volume according to coinmarketcap, is around $23 billion, which looks to be average for the last few months. Not saying the sell-off isn't having a direct and a knock-on effect, but $3.5 billion is about 3 hours trading.

If you take 75 years ago as the end of WW2 then in the UK (where I live) the interest rate has been above 5% for most of that period ( and generally well above that (OK, that is essentially base rate, fiat deposits will pay a bit less). So that is in the right ball park, although I accept that the last decade is an anomaly.
Sure, most people aren't responsible enough to save fiat, but then they won't save anything else either (and worse, they take out loans to buy stuff they could better save up for, houses excepted).
So its not really an issue with fiat, at least to date. What happens next is a different matter ......
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:10:30
*Going from $300 to $20k took about 200 billion give or take*
No, it didn't. I can't say exactly how much it did take, but neither can you. This is because at any given time, most Bitcoin is not for sale. Suppose, for example, 10% is for sale. Then a net fiat inflow of $X raises the market cap by $10X\[\*\]. I strongly suspect that 10% is well over estimated and it is a lot less than that, in which case the multiplier rises accordingly.
\[\*\] Edit: or even more, if sellers increase their price.
Edit 2: As others have pointed out in other replies.
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:19:52
Sorry, he is right, up to a point. 
For instance, Shor's Algorithm [ is a quantum algorithm that will solve the prime factorization problem at a rate which is almost exponentially faster than the fastest known classical factoring algorithm. In principal this could break public key cryptography such as RSA.
However, there are known quantum-safe classical algorithms, see [ so if it became an issue I guess the blockchain could be changed so as to become secure again.

People forget that to increase market cap by $N does not require $N to be spent. It only requires enough to be spent to make sellers increase their limit sells by $N. I don't have the figure - it's not set in stone anyway - but I'd bet that it is a lot less than $N.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:39:10
These two comments are spot on, and I'll add my bit ....
Anyone buying Bitcoin as an investment (actually, buying anything as an investment) should have decided beforehand what loss they are prepared to take before they bail out. If you are an out-and-out hodler then you are prepared to take a 100% loss, other people will decide other amounts, the amount is your decision based on your circumstances. Once that decision is taken there is no reason to bail out earlier (unless your financial circumstances and you need fiat in a hurry).
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:06:04

OK, fair enough, so you are looking at a five-year time frame. But if you say "N-period Bollinger" (or N-period anything for that matter) most people will interpret "period" as the candle period. So, 5-year Bollinger would be taken as Bollinger with 5-year candles, which clearly makes no sense for Bitcoin because it hasn't been around anything like long enough.

My bet is this is because of the Binance announcement that US customers will not be able to use it from September. All the Alts on Binance and falling rapildy, likely they are being sold for BTC which can then be moved off the exchange. So, not sure this price rise is going to hold.

You have to factor in interest you could earn on that fiat. Over 75 years, interest at about 4.5% will compensate for the inflation.

Nope. My statement was not a hypothesis; my statement was one of fact, viz., a 700BTC sell at that moment would drop the price to $7630; a similar buy would raise it to around $8100 (OK, maybe affected by stops being triggered). A 700BTC sell or buy would have to occur over a longer period for order removal/addition to have an effect.

I'm inclined to think that, at the moment, the Bitcoin price is \*more\* stable - in the sense that it will have less wild swings, even while the price rises - because there is more institutional investment, because there are more hodlers, and because retail people are in the game earlier in the cycle, all of whom are much less likely to be spooked by pullbacks. OTOH when the retail FOMO kicks in, then it's going to be a wild ride.

I'm prepared to accept that there is market manipulation, and that the whales - because they have enough BTC to do it - manipulate the market to accrue BTC and/or USD (or fiat of choice). But I've always maintained that they do not want to crash the market to the point where they kill BTC, because to do so would render their hoards near worthless.

Not a stupid question.
Assuming you are looking to be in this as a medium or longer term investment, (ie., you are not trading), then the answer is to ask "what do I think is going to happen to the price of Bitcoin in the future". If you think it is going to go up then, then buy, if you think it is going to go down, do not buy.  Whether you personally won or lost in the past is not relevant (though price action in the past might or might not inform your judgement about the future).

Don't know if it portends anything, but on Bitstamp at the moment, price about $7750, there are big sell walls and bu no big buy walls. It would take the sale of 700BTC to drop the price to $7630; buying that amount would rise the price to nearly $8100.

What I find fascinating ATM is the steady rise in BTCUSD longs on Bitfixex. It started around 25th Nov and has been going up almost linearly ever since, to the tune of around $140M. My guess - and a few other people have commented much the same - is it is a whale (or whales) who have a price they don't think BTC will drop below, and who are in effect DCA'ing low-margin longs against that price. If so, someone is pretty confident that the price is gonna go back up.
FWIW, this is my strategy at the moment, DCA with fiat and extend my margin to match (but, relatively speaking, on a microbial scale).
@_date: 2019-12-09 13:48:31
I have a target. Might reach it, might not, but the risk/reward ratio is good. If BTC hits the target, I sell. Maybe I will miss out some possible gain, but I will be entirely happy. So, no.

And for anyone interested, the Google translation of the summary:
*Cryptocurrencies are driving us crazy. Excited investors, new millionaires in bitcoins, workers in digital silver mining, frightened economists, and all kinds of cassandres: cryptocurrencies have already shaken up whole areas of economic thought, for better or for worse. But is that all? Do they have any destiny other than to further facilitate exchanges that hardly need it? Are they just food for scavengers eager for benefits from the competing greed of the states? For Mark Alizart, it is not so. With the advent of cryptocurrencies, it is a real upheaval in the very nature of value, of any value, whether financial or otherwise, that we are witnessing. Henceforth, value is no longer decided by an institution or a market, it is the object of a collective appropriation - making for the first time thinkable a communism that is not utopian.

Agreed, rather good from a mainstream outlet. I think the asymmetric return argument is particularly telling.

@_date: 2019-09-12 13:54:56
**The Prediction: Like The Prophecy only more wordy**....
This is predicated on the assumptions that (a) the whales are able to manipulate the market, that (b) the whales do manipulate the market and (c) the whales' long-term aim is to have a high-value, and more importantly, high-liquidity market. The last point is justified by my claim that without a high-liquidity market, the whales' Bitcoin is worth a whole lot less than they would like. To this end I assume (d) that the whales do not want the price of BTC to tank (at least, not yet, and then only in line with previous cycles).
Early this year, it was noticed that the whales were accumulating again, the bart patterns started to disappear, and the price duly started on its way up, particularly after the April BGD. The rise was pretty smooth, with swings of around 10% in late-May and early-June only, until it hit the $13900 high in June.
Since then there have been a series of wild price swings, around 30% in the first instance, then gradually reducing (so we see the wedge pattern). I suggest that this is significantly the result of price manipulation by the whales, allowing them to accumulate BTC and fiat (typically USD). But, the price was solidly supported in the $9000-$9500 range, and in the last few days around $10000. I'd suggest that the whales do not want the price to drop below those levels, and will buy BTC with fiat accumulated over the summer. $10000 is one of those nice round numbers that people like, and I suspect that any convincing drop below would result in too many people saying "well, Bitcoin had another shot at it, but it looks like that's it". Bitcoin would not die, but it would be a wound that might take a long while to recover from.
So, now we run into Autumn (in the northern hemisphere, that's Fall for my former colonial cousins), and it is now time to drive the price up the next step. So, I think we will start to see a steady price rise again; the whales will buy enough to get the price moving, and rely on other investors to keep it moving. Peering into my two crystal balls, I can now foretell two scenarios.
First scenario, the price will ramp quite quickly up to the $18000-$19000 range before pulling back hard, plausibly to around $16000, which happens to be what the prophecy says. I'm not claiming that whoever made the prophecy is some all-knowing clairvoyant, but the value seems plausible, on the grounds that a move up to the ATH and only a bit over $20000 before a pull back would not look so good, people saying "so, BTC broke the ATH but could not manage any more .....". My thought would be that the whales would kill the rise below that point for that reason.
Second scenario, price goes up, breaks the $19400 ATH ("Breaking News! Bitcoin breaks above previous ATH!"), then blasts through $20000 ("Breaking News! Bitcoin passes $20000, now in uncharted waters!"). Under those conditions, I'd suggest that we would see FOMO on a truly industrial scale the likes of which have never been seen before.
Of course, this might all be a load of old cobblers .......
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:36:36
And, I fear, to store Bitcoin. You can see the marketing spiel "Why risk losing the keys to your wallet. Store your Bitcoin with as, and access it safely and securely, just the same as your dollars (pounds, euros....)" and the average punter will do then that. Then, of course, the Banks can apply the normal lending to deposits ratio and \*lend\* Bitcoin, and so the amount of Bitcoin in circulation expands. Granted, central governments won't be able to print Bitcoin like they print dollars (pounds, euros....) but it is half-way there :(

@_date: 2019-09-13 08:02:11
Actually a good question, opinions differ.
My opinion (to be honest, my guess) is that they do have enough influence, because the market is low-liquidity at the moment. I can't remember the figure, but the ratio of spend to change in market cap. is pretty large (so if someone pumps say $10M into bitcoin, the market cap. rises by N * $10M when N is pretty large).
I'd doubt there is conspiracy-level coordination, but I reckon they they mostly have common interests, so will tend to act independently but still more or less in unison.
But again, that might all be bollocks as well :)

Where is  when you need a good laugh?
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:01:37
Well, the article makes some assumptions without making it clear that they are assumptions, or justifying those assumptions.
For instance, it talks about governments using the banks to deal with things like the financial crash on 2008. But that financial crash was caused by the banks in the first place, precisely because banks can in effect create money, which is what they did in the sub-prime lending crisis. So, perhaps, if the banks went away, then so would that problem.
Second, it assumes that people will hold Bitcoin (or whatever) because they think it will increase in value. But that assumes that Bitcoin does increase in value, which, in the long term, it can't (sure, it could rise much higher, but there is a limit).
Third, it suggests that there are just too many different coins to be usable. But that is an assumption that because there are currently lots of coins, there will always be lots of coins; it is just as possible that as the ecosystem matures, the number of coins will reduce.
So, I have no idea whether Bitcoin (or whatever) will or will not replace fiat, but the article is just noise without any recognition, leet alone justification, of the assumptions on which it is based.

Market making bot I'd expect. On bitfinex, if you do enough $ volume per month then maker fees are zero, so you only have to fight the spread. So the bot keeps the buy order a bit below the price, hoping to catch a sell that dumps enough to drive the price down; when they get it they put a sell order in just above the price to catch the rebound. Works unless the price keeps moving down.

Bitfinex and Binance are both giving USDT prices. Bitfinex is showing a lot higher at the moment because of the Tether/Bitfinex thing. Generally, the USDT price has been a bit higher than the USD price (though they switched round after the April 1st candle).
I personally use Bitstamp because that it where a bunch of my BTC is at the moment, but all the BTCUSD exchanges should show very similar values.

To people who are feeling jumpy today. pull out to the daily chart:
* If you ignore the candle wicks, yesterday was nothing special. The pullback on Feb24 (the day after $4000 was passed) was about twice as big %age-wise, and similarly Apr25 (just after $5500 was passed)
* Switch to Heikin Ashi candles, again yesterday looks a lot less scarey than the pullback on May17 (after $8000 was passed)
* Switch to Renko (ATR(14)) candles, and it has been green all the way since the beginning of the year.

Alternative opinion. This cycle is different:
Institutional investment is onboard unlike the last cycle. These are people who have thought long and hard, have concluded BTC investment has an outstanding risk/reward ratio, and are not going to be spooked by pullbacks into profit taking and the like.
Also onboard much earlier in the cycle are retail investors to have also looked at what has happened in the past, similarly think there is an outstanding risk/reward ratio (aka "its gotta be worth a punt") and are similarly less likely to be spooked into selling.
So, the dips are bought out much more quickly.
Pullbacks will occur later, when real retail FOMO kicks in ....

My Dad used to follow the investment advice of a UK newspaper; whatever they said, he made sure he didn't do that, and was quite successful (a bit like CNBC). On that basis, I predict that BTC will pump quickly up to $10K in the next few days.
Or not.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:32:03
You beat me to it! The way I see it, quick climb to break $9000 triggers a bunch of profit taking, and likely spooks enough people to drive the price back down. Demonstrates that $9000 is attainable, and a bunch of BTC passes from less confident to more confident people. Next time round there are less people who will be spooked, and more people who will hold above $9000.
This is gotta be positive.

Yeh, but what is noticable these days, is how quickly the drops get bought back, like there are plenty of buyers waiting for a dip.

Quicker, yes; new ATH yes but not sure how much higher. Reasons being institutional investers who won't be spooked by pullbacks and who are soaking/will soak up a lot of BTC; and more retail investers who have seen the way BTC price behaves over time also not being spooked, and are getting in on the game earlier. Full scale retail FOMO to follow later.
Then again, I might be totally wrong.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:54:09
Maybe, maybe not. Looking at Bitstamp, the week 06 May (the last complete week) shows 96K BTC; the week 4 Dec (just before the ATH) shows 99K BTC. Assuming that 99K BTC was largely retail FOMO, then a lot of the 96K BTC could be retail. What the split actually is is anyone's guess.

Yes. I've seen some people predicting that BTC will be forced down really low, like to $1200. Not that I'm suggesting it is going to be plain sailing all the way, but the more BTC climbs away from the January low, and the more fiat flows in, the less and less sense it makes to force a big dump (and the harder it becomes).
@_date: 2019-05-29 20:02:26
Sure, I expect there will be another ATH and another crash, nothing new there. What I think willbe different is that the cycle will be shorter and the price will go higher, because the institutional investers and the early-cycle retail investers will hold on longer, which will restrict the supply over and above the next halving. When the true retail FOMO kicks in I think it will do so on an industrial scale.
Edited for more clarity.

Same amount in USD is dollar cost averaging, same amount in BTC is dollar value averaging. See [ for a discussion (likely other places as well).
If you think BTC is going to rise a lot, then I guess dollar cost averaging is the better option.

So really, for most people, the questions to ask are (a) can I afford additional risk above and beyond what I already have and (b) do I think the chance of BTC going up enough in a relevant timescale is enough to take on that risk. If so buy; if not then don't. Of course, the answers may change day to day: car repairs cost less than I expected; heating boiler broke down; and of course, BTC price has changed, but timing the market? Mostly, no.

I always *need* to make big purchases. Its just that I don't have the cash for a small purchase until then.

Or, they will leave it in, in fear loosing profit. I mean, seriously, who knows?

I'm just shy of 62 which makes me a tail-end boomer. Currently 80% up (or 77% if my stops get hit ... and yes, I understand the not your keys/not your coins arguments).
Agree with the reply about boomers benefiting and millennials paying the bill, but I didn't vote for it!
But now it is in my interest to know about crypto, so I can shaft you lot again /s

It's informal American English. The English English would say something more like "I say old chap, I do believe that if you have a quick shuftee\[\*\], you might just notice that .....".
\[\*\] Probably from Indian English.

Yes. If you look at the one day candles, the Binance induced dump doesn't even figure, its just another green candle day.

OK, so here's my thought, though it could be said to be self-serving optimism. Anyways .... I think we are in an ATH-crash-ATH cycle which will be much shorter than last one. Not like ATH in a few months short, but some time in 2020. Reasons:
The ATH cycles before the 2017 ATH were just early adopters - the techies, the nerds, the visionaries. Little or no retail, little or no institutional. The 2017 ATH rise started much the same, but it wasn't until mid- to late-2017 that retail FOMO kicked in, and there was still little or no institutional.
But, there is now a whole load more institutional money coming in. These are people who will not panic at a few swings, they are not going to sell for a significant length of time, and they will effectively reduce the pot of Bitcoin for sale.
Now, a lot of people got burned by entering late in 2017, but there will be a lot of people who got in and out OK. Some of the people who got burned will think, OK, sunken investment, I know what I did wrong last time; those who got in and out will be eyeing up a rematch. And, a whole load of people who took notice late-2017 but decided (correctly) it was too late will also be waking up and smelling the coffee.
Post the 2017 ATH there has been lots and lots of "Bitcoin is dead" stuff in the mainstream press, now there is going to be a lot of "Bitcoin might look like it is making a come back but don't chance it". But after a while, people are going to think "f\*\*k, I should have ignored the nay-sayers" and then they will get in quick and hard.
So, yes, I also think there could be FOMO on a truly industrial scale.

Current price action resembling previous cycles. Increasingly positive sentiment. Whale wallets accumulating. Institutional investment growing.

Actually no. At 23.39% per day, the price would be about :
exponential compounded returns are a wonderful thing ... but not that wonderful.
A mere 1% per day would get us to $2869026.86

An interesting (if pointless) speculation at 20:51 GMT: assuming that the daily candles show a day as midnight to midnight GMT, is today going to close in the green?

I know, its awful, that "should I go to the toilet now or should I carry on watching the price action" feeling.
@_date: 2019-05-01 12:32:24
Correct, but there are risks all ways round. I keep my coins on an exchange since I keep fairly loose stops to protect myself against sudden large falls in value; they are also distributed over several exchanges to spread the exchange-fails risk.
Basically you buys your coins and takes your pick.

Ouch. Which is worse, the CEO of Binance suggesting it, or someone who has contributed to Core!

As opposed to a theoretical amount of non-quantum computing? I guess then you'd have to argue that the successively increasing infinities (in the sense that the cardinality of the real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers) would provide qualitatively greater computing power.

If you have shallow pockets, you can use someone like IG to do the same. I've looked at it, might be fun in the immediate aftermath of the next ATH.
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:24:32
I'm tempted to think that retail FOMO is kicking in much, much earlier this cycle. I don't mean like at end-2017 levels (yet), but there is a lot more awareness of what might be coming, and a lot of people thinking "a $XXXX punt has just got to be worth a go". Plus, growing institutional investment will be restricting the amount of tradeable BTC. So, up we go (until I am proven wrong which might be as soon as a couple of milliseconds after I hit the "Reply" button ...)

True. In which case they are certain of 0% taxation.
Of course, that is until the government changes the taxation rules. Or Earth suffers an extinction level event or something (Sun becomes a red giant, the waterbears will have a hard time). Death is certain (unless one believes Everett's Many World interpretation of QM, see the Quantum Suicide conundrum), Taxes (even if at 0%) is pretty damn close.

I don't use SMS 2FA, but I presume a pay-as-you-go SIM would be secure, as there would be no way to get the number moved.

Currently I'm up a few % because of the stops, though I don't necessarily expect that to last. It's a risk I'm prepared to take to minimise the chance of being hit by a big drop.
Yes, I could use an exchange that allows margin trading, but I decided that was too far outside my experience and time constraints.
