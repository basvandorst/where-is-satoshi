What do people think about the alternate *coin currencys? I was looking at litecoin and it is slightly starting to rise in value/bitcoin and is still quite easy to mine. Also anyone know if its possible to use the ASIC devices to mine anything else? Might need to have custom firmware written, but even if it could; would it be slow since they are made specifically for butcoin?

They did say that; it was lies/unknowingly wrong. GPU mining is much faster and more worthwhile.

Nope even with litecoin GPU mining is FAR superior now.

Just a warning, i'm not sure what payment processor they are using but i made an order earlier with bitcoin but the  status never changed and is still "awaiting payment/expired".
I'm sure it will be fixed whenever reads the message i sent online but something seems to be broken currently.

The first batch sold out months ago but the second batch is going on sale within 24 hours for $1500 but only payable in bitcoins.

That is very possible given we find someone who is familiar developing using Android API (if that is not yourself). Seeing BTC from a global perspective is a very smart way to view the potential open markets as language restrictions hold back a very large volume of users. Hiring a translator or choosing a third developer who is fluent in Japanese (and English) would not be out of the question either.

Even that hardly narrows it down, the main concern i have is that every letter, symbol, number, space and punctuation totally changes the end address. It is extremely possible to have tried a string which was in fact almost correct but ended up with the wrong address due to a single letter or word being typed or quoted differently.

It seems you are correct. It does appear that the source code is public for the app, i am interested in republishing it. If anyone is familiar with the facebook developer api and would like to help please send me a message. The original developer posted the code on git and left a [message]( saying anyone can use it in future.

I still think bitcoin is in it's infancy and to think that all markets are already  saturated is taking a very small view on everything.
Without first knowing the skills and constraints of the people i am working with it is very difficult to set a specific project and goal.

I don't understand how we are supposed to randomly guess these.. Could be ANY string 15 symbols long, from the whole internet that's a lot of things.

In my first reply i linked to the pre sales thread which details the product and were to buy it. Currently avalon are the only people to have made an asic unit. Butterfly labs are also making one but are very shady with the details and have had many setbacks.

I am offering to cover potentially thousands of dollars of startup costs to people who would otherwise not not have the time, opportunity or funds to manage something like this.
It is also not just about being able to code as well as 3 people, the idea is to balance the work in order to allow more people to join who could not typically develop on top of regular work hours.

There is a secret trickjump area behind the pig racing, spent over an hour on it and couldn't do it.
@_date: 2013-08-31 06:21:12
Yep i did try this out when it was first released and it was simple and worked well. No idea why they are shutting it down.

Is there any reason to use this over 
As far as i can tell this website has to be manually processed for all orders were as steambits is fully automated and instant when i tested it a few weeks back.
@_date: 2013-04-17 03:25:04
Can confirm this works.
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:29:02
I think you are over-reading and misunderstanding. There idea here is to start small and not over extend the group of people and if all goes well eventually branch into other larger projects. I am absolutely not expecting or intending to launch any kind of site that one would call a major player in any industry. The aim is to start making a little coin for us as the currency grows as having a holding early on is going to be important for when it grows in future.

I would be covering all startup costs up to several thousands of dollars if needed, along with keeping everyone organised and in communication. I feel i can do more of the management of the servers and domains and keep everything running and paid for. I would also be in charge of public relations and marketing our products which i feel is vital for a website to become popular. I have reasonable skills in general networking and have done a small amount of security work on websites. I have done some very minimal coding in the past but nothing that is of production value mostly small edits of existing code.
With regards to your services you would become a primary shareholder and equal partner in the company with as much input in decisions as everyone else.

The avalon unit is an independent computer, only need one host computer to control it. Really isn't difficult once you have it, turn it on and it starts mining and you do nothing else except keep it on 24/7. At current difficulty it makes ~11BTC per day.

Someone made a facebook app already months ago to send btc via facebook that was simple and worked perfectly, does anyone remember the link?
