Damn. There are a lot of charities missing out by not accepting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:17:32
Funny is not something this show does.

True facts. I love it when it goes up. I love it when it goes down. I love you all. Even you Roger Ver. Merry Xmas. ONE LOVE!!! ����

Definitely Maybe he can get the word out to charities to start taking bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:52:12
Sounds good!
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:06:19
Cool. You should short it all the way to zero!
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:33:40
Or buy a Trezor!
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:21:26
My guess is they do it for the dank memes. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:19:32
Thank you for your service ��
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:19:06
No need for all that. Buy bitcoin instead.

I just checked the epochtalk github and it certainly appears they are actively working on it.

You’re better off just throwing that money out the window and reading a good book instead. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:47:59
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:46:00
Right on!
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:24:22
I think once a month is a solid choice. Don’t try to time the market. Just set a date and stick with it.

Here is the thing that most people aren’t grasping. Bitcoin is not just money. This is only the beginning. I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the TannhÃ¤user Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:33:06
It’s got a very fraudulent feel to it.

What if Satoshi Nakamoto dumped all his BCH at once with the maximum amount of transactions possible?
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:26:58
Is there a reason they do this? Do they get a cut?
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:59:33
Set up a plan to invest the same amount every month or twice a month. You can’t time this shit.

I have noticed a common theme for these guys. They are wrinkly old men hanging on to the past and have not the slightest idea of what bitcoin really is. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:02:10
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:28:27
Thanks. I need need to do that. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:06:28
The most amazing thing is that we have barely scratched the surface of the bitcoin protocol. Exciting times my friend!
