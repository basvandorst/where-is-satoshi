Malaysian here. In summary, government corruption on the highest level. 
The point on the chart where you see a hyperbolic increase in fleeing MYR corresponds to the period where the USA's Department of Justice announced their findings on the largest ever corruption scandal our country has faced. 
It involves the misappropriation of the money from the sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB set up by our prime minister himself. 
Out of the known US$1 billion that has flown into various asset vehicles belonging to the prime minister, his relatives and close allies, more than US$700 million went directly into his personal bank account. 
The local criminal justice system is corrupt as well hence all charges was dropped, as usual. But this time, things are not as simple as the Prime Minister and his allies are likely to be charged in US soil as they have broken the State's law. 
To prove how serious this is, the deputy public prosecutor was kidnapped a day before he was to deliver the arrest warrant and found dead in a concrete stuffed barrel. The office floor where they kept the investigation material and evidence had an 'accident' where it went on fire and everything destroyed.
Hence, there are speculation that he fears a loss in power may lead to him being extradited, prosecuted and jailed the US.
Adding on, ever since the current prime minister took power, the Malaysian Ringgit has consistently lost it's value due to poor management and corruption. The MYR-USD has just hit an 18-year low. 
For some time now, the local population, most who were not financial-savvy are now realizing the impact inflation has had on their lives. Stagnating low wages and rising living cost due to the depreciation of the Ringgit has led many to voice out their disapproval on the current administration.
Our country's next general election is schedule in 2018 but there have been hints that the Prime Minister is looking to push forward the GE to this year amid fears of growing opposing votes by then. 
This election is very crucial to the current prime minister for reasons stated above. Furthermore, Malaysia's election process is heavily corrupt as well, but that is a story for another day.
Some Malaysians and regional economic experts are suspecting that the current administration have been trying(but failed) to keep the Ringgit afloat to buy time for the election, by burning through our countries's foreign reserves. Note that the prime minister is also the finance minister in the country.
And for many market savvy Malaysians, we have seen what could happen when our foreign reserves are depleted and left open to currency attacks, which had happened before during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. 
But this time, many of us do not foresee a healthy recovery for the Ringgit if it ever crashes as the oil price is no longer what it was. Oil and Gas is roughly 20% of the total GDP.
TL'DR: things are bad, and shit is coming quick. But sadly many Malaysian who are not financially literate or tech-savvy will just end up getting eaten whole.

Do you have any recommendations? I'm planning to build this for a service that allows users to make auto withdrawals any time they like.

Look up for cash trades on LocalBitcoins

TravelbyBit is awesome. Tried their system a couple of times and definitely one of the smoothest merchant experience I've had. 
I've been following TBB's work for a while now. They are the first bitcoin company to roll out Lightning payments to the physical retail space! (They have about 300 merchants across Australia)
Their founders are also big bitcoin supporters and are quite active in the Australian Bitcoin space.
@_date: 2019-04-15 04:30:44
Thanks for the example!   
But what if in a rare occasion where right after a transaction is made, another payout is requested, and I end up not having enough spendable balance because most of them are still unconfirmed in change addresses?
@_date: 2017-04-08 05:19:07
 The solution is here. I am testing the bitcoin debit card that runs on the COMIT network, instant cross-chain settlememt using the lightning network. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 06:40:50
Thanks! That's really helpful information.
@_date: 2017-04-10 03:26:19
Try this: 
This company developed the COMIT network, open source cross-blockchain settlement system. 
I have a debit card of theirs and it works globally with no FX fees or amy sorts. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 06:36:21
Good point. But in some scenarios like a Bitcoin ATM network, where it could go days without any activity, to having bombarded with orders in a short timeframe.

Where in Brisbane did you locate this place?

TravelbyBit has already made that into a reality at the beginning of the year.
