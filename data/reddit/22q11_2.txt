Good luck getting money in and out of Korea.

Right, but it’s still a bet/gamble that it’ll increase to what you bought it at.
In the meantime, you can cut your losses and make your money work for you somewhere else.

It's a hyperbole used to make a point. I don't think anyone on here actually expects that it would ever go all the way to 0.

You can at least do reasonable due diligence on them and they're highly regulated by the government. Due diligence on cryptos is basically "here, read this PDF by the creators of the coin that's basically propaganda"

I'm a dual citizen. It's not easy. Anything over 10k cumulative has to be reported, anything over 50k cumulative has to be approved.

I think you have a fundamental lack of understanding of how strict South Korean anti-money laundering laws are.


Again, you're not the first one to think of this (surprise!). Every altcoin with enough volume, stability, and without an exorbitant withdrawal fee is at a premium in Korean markets.

lol I have Korean citizenship, I know what I'm talking about. Forex transactions above 10k have to be reported, over 50k cumulative over a 1-year-period have to be approved. There has been a premium in the korean crypto market for years; don't you think if it was possible, someone would've figured it out by now?

Yeah, be really patient for when it goes down to 0.
That statement is just betting on that it will go back up aka gambling

That’s what literally every merchant does. They use bitpay to convert it to fiat. Always have, always will.

Have you seen the stock market lately?
My speculative gains in the stock market YTD have outperformed BTC and crypto since the beginning of 2017.
