Well done to you! However i don't think hooking all bitcoin mines on hydropower plants would work out that well, since, well, hydropower plants are a limited good! Also unfortunately today alot of bitcoin mines are situated in China where they make use of coal-based electricity, cause it's the cheaper option. I guess that it speaks for itself that this cannot be sustained in the years to come and Bitcoin definitely needs a good solution to it's energy problem! 
Any thoughs on the matter(Bitcoin using absurd amounts of energy) as a Bitcoin miner?
Just my 2 grains of salt, cheers, and a happy xmas!

You forgot the biggest flaw of them all, the amount of energy it costs to maintain the blockchain. At this rate it would use the same amount of energy as we use now in the entire world in a few years if nothing changes!

How about the massive amount of energy that's being used to make the blockchain? Definitely not sustainable for even the nearby future as it is now.

Germany actually got hit by hyperinflation between 1918-1924, special circumstances perhaps, but still, it can happen.
