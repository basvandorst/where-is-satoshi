If we could accurately predict the movements of bitcoin, we'd all be rich.

The Google Auth app is absolutely fantastic..... right up until you need to change phones and realise it has no backup/restore feature.
Authy has backup/restore natively and is fully compatible with everything Google Auth can do.

Is this the application suite that is going to replace the set of Chrome apps now that they are being killed off?

Just drink cans of Strong.
600mL can, 9% alcohol content, about USD$1.10 per can. Tastes absolutely horrid, but you can't taste anything after the first can so it doesn't matter.
Can be found in every single FamilyMart.

I can also vouch for coinjar. I have bought over $250 worth of bitcoin from them and have had no issues.
I can also confirm that verifications can take a while if you do not contact support.
@_date: 2014-06-16 06:22:17
Isn't that like asking what you do when you don't have any fiat in your bank account?
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:22:28
I can also vouch for coinjar, my GF and I have collectively bought about half a bitcoin from them with no issues.
Can take a while to get verified with them if you don't contact support about it though.

I know this isn't the right place to say this, but paying for University upfront must be horrifying. I'm a big fan of Australia's HECS debt.

As an aside, that's a terrible wage system. I'd hate for my wage to vary from hour to hour.
However, this is the internet. You'd be getting $0 for your reddit comments normally, so why complain when you get more than $0?
@_date: 2014-10-07 01:02:50
For what it's worth, you'd be guaranteed to be getting money for any in-app purchases people make if they can only pay via Bitcoin.
Unless you verify in-app purchases outside of the client app, there are several android apps which allow you to spoof in-app purchases without actually spending real money.

This is the internet, you can't assume we're all American.
(Although in this particular instance, you and lukestokes are.)

Why is free money an insult?
@_date: 2014-11-03 03:23:39
Yeah, how dare he give someone free money!
@_date: 2014-11-03 05:30:49
Sadly I'm neither (very) young, nor have much free time. I'm also pretty happy with my finances.
In this particular context, I think the purpose of the tip is to ensure the user learning about bitcoin is provided with a negligible amount of bitcoin which they can essentially practice transactions with.
@_date: 2014-08-11 01:58:16
Except for Australia. We're in the middle of scrapping our 1000/1000 FTTP plan for a 25/1 FTTN solution. Yup.
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:26:44
I don't get it. Is it an American thing to be gravely insulted by an incredibly small tip?
In Australia, we don't have a tipping culture at all, so you would be getting $0 from tips here.
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:28:33
How dare the price be not what you say it should be! The nerve of those traders!

Why did you have passwords saved in your browser?
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:36:17
Not to condone illegal stuff, but you could always just chuck it through a mixer. Not sure how they'd keep track of it after that.
@_date: 2014-03-27 06:42:39
It is also being advertised on a (the?) bitcoin wiki: 
Which is linked to from  , the first result when googling "vanity bitcoin address"
@_date: 2014-07-13 23:39:56


I don't understand why eBay lets people do that. It's basically an invisible starting price. Just put your reserve price as the starting price.
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:32:18
To be fair, if you were going to use Bitcoin, how would they have taken your money when you are the one who needs to initiate the transaction?
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:50:51
It must be an American thing to be "insulted" by being given more money than was required.
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:00:28
Fair enough.
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:15:45
How can you say that it is insulting, but every comment where you get thanked but not given money isn't insulting? By your logic, doesn't that mean they value your input even less?
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:23:21
A good idea, but not all of us have that luxury. Basements pretty much aren't a thing in Australia.
@_date: 2016-01-31 23:16:48
Phrenico, relax.
You feel that you need a gun. ThePiachu feels that he doesn't need a gun. You both have two different opinions.
There is no point arguing. You will both, like everyone else on the planet, inevitably die. You are both completely equal. Relax.

Authy is a Google Authenticator alternative, usable wherever GA is, that allows you to backup your codes.
This won't help you now, but I recommend using it in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:37:53


This is still happening in Australia
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:19:52
Looks like you already collected it through ChangeTip.
Go to  to withdraw it.
Incidentally, the tip you got is worth about USD$25 now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:39:51
Theoretically, yes. However, you have no way of generating that exact wallet. If you were able to generate exact wallets, there'd be nothing stopping you generating the wallet of Satoshi Nakamoto's stash.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:35:46
Further on this, when you're setting up your hardware wallet for the first time (or after a factory reset) it insists that you write down the seed words it shows on its screen. You should therefore have the seed words written down somewhere safe.

Any non-zero amount will be fine.

btcmarkets is the way to go, I used Coinjar until I realised they were screwing me on fees and the spread.
