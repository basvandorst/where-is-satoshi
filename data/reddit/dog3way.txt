Yeah, the old ACUs and BDUs are a real sign of competence.
We swiched to Multicam and flatscreen monitors years ago.

Love that "stock photo" circa 2004 showing a couple lieutenants running a battalion TOC. 
What does the U.S. Army, bitcoin and this story have in common? Nothing but the picture on the link.

Keep a pair of scissors in your car and just cut up your bank cards if you are that worried.
Or a self addressed stamped envelope you can seal off your bank cards in. Cops can't open your mail without a warrant.

Fuck it guys, I don't know. I agree with you but what are you gonna do, huh?

US Stamps, sealed and addressed? That little stamp is not just a sticker, but it's a seal that allows the USPS to take custody of the parcel to ship it to either the addressed recipient or the sender. First amendment protects both the sender and recipient
Police can't open mail without a warrant or your permission if it's your mail. 
Edit: added first amendment.

Well, I tried. Good luck Oklahoma.

Yeah. Sorry about your brother. If you think anyone on this sub is looking out for your betterment, get ready to get real disappointed.
As for the Bitcoin, I hope you can recover it but before you commit to getting some "help", why not read up on Bitcoin and do it yourself?

Go fuck yourself

Yes I can. I am a veteran who fought in war and served my country. I volunteered my life to give in defense of our country. 
So thanks for your service as a volunteer fire fighter.

Joe Rogan has always been the cutting edge of kickass counter culture stuff since Newsradio.
