Experts say a lot of weird things these days....

I would say it's not the best time to invest.
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:32:24
This is fucking hilarious 
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:24:56
Wouldn't we all like to see bitcoin up so we can buy some teslas?
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:59:50
May your words be the truth
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:29:59

This is just a severe case of copy cat and fomo, also huge lack of knowledge.

Without Bitcoin there is no alt-coins, without Bitcoin there is no crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:14:37
The more people know about blockchain technology the more they will be inclined to actually invest in bitcoin or any other crypto.

The main article says that bitfinex is negotiating on moving to Switzerland, which I think they will do because it is a smart move.

Always buy and hold and forget that you bought anything, after some time you will be surprised.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:29:27
Some people will choose bitcoin over their mother tbh
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:01:32
Have you used other platforms? This kind of stuff doesn't happen only on bitfinex, other platforms have these "mysterious" trades.
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:22:58
LOL. Bitfinex is making dreams come true :D

I think 7k is actually a lot. I also think this is just a dip in the big scheme of things. For me, this is just a time for me to get my buy orders going on bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:28:08
It's 6.7k on Bitfinex right now so I guess that wasn't the bottom.
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:36:51

@_date: 2018-04-13 14:15:04
