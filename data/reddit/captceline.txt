"bitcoin is used by people across the globe from all cultures and ideologies. let's not try push an agenda."
When I step back and look at WHY people from all over the globe are interested, I find that many of us share a similar system of belief - one that is related to shared agenda ;) 
This is despite and often "in spite" of the various cultures many of us slave under.

I really like the image of the Silver denarius of Marcus Junius Brutus at the top of the post.
About the coin from: 
"Macedonia (northern Greece), 43-42 BC
A coin celebrating ancient Rome's most famous murder
This coin was struck in honour of Marcus Junius Brutus, one of the assassins of Julius Caesar. The reverse shows the cap of liberty given to freed slaves flanked by two daggers. This indicates Brutus' intention of freeing Rome from Caesar's imperial ambitions and the murder weapons employed to do so. Below is the day of the deed; EID.MAR, the ides of March."

Bitpay is awesome. I'm curious to hear from offline merchants who are using it in this manner too - how it integrates into their sales process, customer experience, etc...

And if the "conspiracy" didn't have a step by step plan to make this happen - Mike just provided a blueprint for them?..

Only posted it, as I figure it's important to know what other people are reading. This was cross posted on PrisonPlanet - and they have a huge non MSM readership. Isn't it important to know what's being written and read so it can be responded to in a beneficial way?

Would be interested in any feedback - especially if these tools would be used if released for free to the Bitcoin community. Thanks!

On the "how" side - I'm especially interested in knowing how stores/cafes who accept payment handle the process. Do they give the customer a bill with their BTC address on and wait to confirm? Do they have a QR on display so that customers can send to their wallet from their app - e.g. the blockchain wallet ap?

"And I think here, for us at PayPapl, it's just a question of whether Bitcoin will make its way to PayPal's funding instrument or not, and we're kind of thinking about it right now."
I had to rewind and listen to that several times over to make sure I heard it right. That is one MASSIVE statement quickly slipped into this interview. I get the feeling the rest of the entire interview was wrapping and padding around that one question and answer.

Probably not too nefarious - why don't you ask him yourself?

Very balanced look at the current issues and what the future may hold. Good read.

Nice timing...
Maybe by "nice" I mean "suspicious"...

Sounds like a good idea - the taster part.
