Just did two weeks ago :) Bitcoin paid for our family summer trip!
And with the recent drop, I'll buy some more for next year :D

Much better than a Lambo mister!
You got yourself one of the best investment, after Bitcoin but what good is Bitcoin if you got no place to stay ;)
From what I see you'll thrive in life!

He asked me if he could keep the Bitcoin he'll be using for his presentation �� They say 0.03 btc for everyone on Earth... He's more than ok
Gotta save some for my old days
@_date: 2019-03-07 03:46:06
Mine too, we still have a year or so at around 3800-4000$...
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:30:26

Hey There! New update about the presentation :)
It was amazing! The kids picked it up faster that the teacher �� we asked two of his friends to play seller and buyer ans they had loads of fun moving money around.
Now some parents are asking me about Bitcoin �� I guess it's my turn to spread the word.
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:05:15
He'd be the new Rockefeller ��
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:23:21
Thank you people! I've recieved more than enough. He'll be able to make his presentation without me having a heart attack worrying about loosing it!
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:02:46
I just filled the survey. There's no personnal info to share (your Bitcoin adress is public anyway) I think it will help understand the people who invest in crypto.
I never won anything, why should it change ��
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:27:25
Damn! It won't work...

Not ominous mate! What else you need when you have Bitcoin ��
@_date: 2019-02-17 16:16:21
Good info! Thank's
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:10:26
Haha bought in the blue section... Twice!

Well I'm not in the US (I live in Canada) but I Do pay my cell phone with  every month...
@_date: 2019-02-27 18:33:09
She does know we have Bitcoins and it's a mutual investment. And further more, it is included in our will...
Why on earth would you not tell your "significant" other about your investment? What if you die Tomorrow? Will she be able to use them?

Ducts connected to the central heating my friend. Been heating part of my house for two years now. I don't have enough btu to heat the whole house but my "conventionnal" heater starts half the time now. When the tv's off (witch never happens ��) in the basement, I ear a slight humming noise. Don't ear a thing upstairs.

I don't know about the guy who wrote the article but I wanted to share a good way to do it. I even added an exit so it keeps mining in the summer (actually I have to mess with the Y I've put...) But my money is in my block erupter mining solo ��
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:39:24
He couldn't hodl it!

A custodial wallet means that you have to "trust" the creator of such app as you don't get your private keys. On the other side, they relieve you from setting up your own ln node and investing money to get you started (because you need a bitcoin full node and a Lightning node and some bitcoin to open a channel with another Lightning node if you want to do it on your own)
In other words, it's just like the bank, you have to trust your bank with your money. If the bank goes bankrupt, you get nothing. Same is true with custodial wallet, if the creator of the app closes for some reason, your Satoshi will be lost.

Well, what I care about is that Bitcoin grew 3% in dominance overall. That's good in terms of sh*t coins are dropping ;)
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:07:07
Lightning will be the checking account of Bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:14:07
I like this guy!
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:39:57
It takes too much time. You could make 10% a week (that's what I used to make) but being 50hours in front of a screen is too much for me...
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:56:56
I'd like to see this ��
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:36:51
That's a good one! Best joke so far this year ��

Just did the same with my baby in december, and some silver, and some gold (to satisfy my curiosity to find out witch will perform better over time). No banks will ever get my son's assets.
As of now, gold is the winner!

I always use those bitcoin ATM and buy with cash money. The fees are not high (the one at my local grocery is only 6% above market price and has fee less weekends). 
I don't have much but I like the idea of not needing a bank to store value ;)
