I came here to say this 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:18:56
I feel like if I wait like, an hour, it’s just gonna drop more though. You feel me? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:29:34
After a lot of thought, I’m just going to leave what money I have in Coinbase. People will call me dumb but I only have like a hundred bucks worth of Bitcoin in there and I kind of want to see first hand how it all plays out. Plus they’re a huge company and I think they’re going to try to do right by their customers. Plus you get double or whatever.

Noob here; what is POS and POW? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:11:21
Why does your girlfriend owe you three grand&gt;??/?
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:37:17
Get out of my head. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:34:28
Yeah, his plan *sounds* all fine and dandy until you remember the potential prison charges. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:31:44
I feel you. I get paid tomorrow and I’m debating whether to put my usual allotment into Bitcoin or not...oh, the struggle. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:36:23
Yeah this was my thought it’s like $2.80 or some ridiculous amount where I’m at. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:49:20
In my head I read this in a Scandinavian accent 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:17:49
I appreciate contrarian views. I’ve been discussing Bitcoin a lot at home with my husband and in-laws, and it’s been fun to hear everyone’s viewpoint. My husband is more of a risk taker, and is pushing for us to be investing more heavily into crypto, while my in-laws are more conservative and are giving the advice of doing a maximum contribution to my Roth IRA and work 401k and keeping crypto to more like 10% of my investing portfolio. I’m only 23 but I have like zero expenses right now so it’s a great time for me to put some money away. As a person with some experience, what are some investing options that have what Bitcoin might lack? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:25:18
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:08:43
If I took back and had held all the bitcoin I’d spent on drugs, I’d be sitting pretty. It hurts sometimes, because I work a tough job and can’t afford college but I’m sober now and have a lovely husband and a couple of nice cats and I’m okay. Plus I’d probably have sold at like 500 anyway. I try not to let it get to me. But yeah, I feel you. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:05
Yeah woah wowzers ouch 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:47:29
Thank you!

	When I was a junior in high school in early 2012 my best friend told me she wanted to try cocaine for her birthday, and I had never done drugs (other than smoked pot) and had no idea how to get my hands on coke.  But being the badass chick that I am, I found the sketchiest kid in school and asked him to help me out. We lived in a small town and had no hookups so he said we had to order it online. I was like, totally fucking aghast at the idea you could order cocaine on amazon or whatever and this kid explained it wasn’t like that. He told me about Silk Road and Bitcoin. I shrugged, gave him a hundred bucks, and sure as shit he got he coke. 
	Over the next several years my drug problem escalated and I made many purchases on similar exchanges but now I’m a year sober and see the full potential of cryptocurrency and I’m a hodler for all the right reasons! To the moon!

I love this golden lambo guy. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:21:51
My grandma is a goldbug and she goes to an exchange in her car and buys gold bars and puts them in a safe in a location no one knows but her. I can’t get her into Bitcoin though. Not yet. So not all use the internet I suppose. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:34:13
Noob here; what does FUD stand for?
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:25:05
I just keep wondering how the coming fork is affecting things. Are people stocking up for the upcoming fork? Does that make sense? My instinct is to back off until the dust from the fork settles but maybe I’ll be the one who misses out. Who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:16:57
Yeah if it weren’t for Silk Road I don’t know if I’d be an avid hodler today! Living in a small town forced me to figure out bitcoin to get my fix. Funny how things work out. Now I’m into crypto for all the right reasons. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:47:18
This comment was the first to make me literally laugh out loud in a long time. Bless your very soul. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:22:19
Maybe put half of into Bitcoin? Then you still have money if you want to upgrade your computer, take a girl on a date, what have you, but you’ve also put enough into Bitcoin that long term you could see some real gains. That’s just my two cents fiat. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:13:45
Finally we’re below 7k again. I almost feel like buying. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:37:01
Dammit. I genuinely thought I was cultivating psychic abilities. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:03:20
I’m a noob but I’m keeping my stuff on Coinbase because they said they’ll handle it and I trust them. They’re a big company with a lot of customers to keep happy and they seem to have a plan. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:59:37
That’s ouch, bro. My husband leaves all the crypto purchases up to me and I haven’t messed up like that yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:02:00
Much thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:32:49
Yeah I’ve had so many problems with authentication on GDAX I’ll just pay a fee on Coinbase at this point, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:10:33
Brush your teeth!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:34
You made Boo Radley come out just to say this. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:08:30
I’m down. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:10:53
Hahaha fair point. Good thing I have a negligible amount of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:43:05
Have you yet posted a link to your tweets so we can retweet them and help you get exposure? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:40:59
Papa Bless
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:49:32
Yeah I was honestly a little disappointed. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:25:31
Just gotta HODL until I die, I guess 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:59:29
I want to hold crypto currencies until I can just use them to make all my purchases. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:11:46
Coinbase just charges a pretty penny to buy through them. You’re basically paying for ease of use. If you buy through GDAX limit orders there are no fees. I buy though Coinbase if I don’t have any fiat stocked up on GDAX and a dip hits, though. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 03:18:04
It's so nice to meet someone who loves Bitcoin and can effectively use "hullabaloo" and "asshole" in one very short post. You single? 
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:13:00
That's awesome! I had no idea. This subreddit rocks my socks off. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:04:02
I love hearing stories like that! 
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:59:26
No. Unfortunately, they are worthless and you should probably give them to me for proper disposal. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:43:45
Ooh yeah, 'member?
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:08:01
I’m in the under 1k club. But I was hodling, um, about, about $.75 worth at the time. *facepalm*
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:21:27
So I should just move them to a wallet basically.
