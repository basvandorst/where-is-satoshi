So are you saying you have concrete evidence that the Consumer Price Index produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is wrong? They are misrepresenting or lying about data?
And when you say "price" doubles every 10 years what exactly are you referring to? The only thing that possibly doubles every 10 years is property value in some areas.

He meant it sarcastically, but in reality, it's not sarcastic at all.  Bank, is safe, bitcoin is high risk to lose, high risk to gain.  Just depends where you are at in your life to determine which is better for you.

Inflation rate is between 2-3%.

Correct.  But you don’t keep money in a bank for returns, it’s not suppose to be ahead of inflation.

Your problem is you act like it's an exact science.  Doing what you are doing has MASSIVE risks that you are ignoring.  It has the highest opportunity for success but also the greatest chance of absolute failure.  People with a family to support, college, retiring funds, etc, can't always take the massive risk that there money could lose double digit percentage value on a whim.

Also, another thing to noet , is if you are looking in certain markets of prices doubling every 10 years, that information tells you absolutely NOTHING about inflation.  Each year, people are spending more and more on housing rather than other goods, does that mean inflation is higher than 2-3%? Not at all.  Property (possibly) doubling every 10years does not mean inflation is 10%.

That was my only point, it is probably worth taking the risk if it's money you can afford to lose.
