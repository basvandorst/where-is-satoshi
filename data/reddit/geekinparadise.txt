Cranking out the accounts to spam the sub with, huh?

It would be a terrible Litecoin miner. ASIC's do 1 thing well, and Litecoin is not it.

Eleuthria has plans to kill getwork if it reaches that level which will kill 15% of the hashing power. It's in good hands imho.

Once you get verified, you can increase the limits to $10,000/day &amp; $50,000/month

I'm no expert on the matter, but I would assume so. They're designed just for that.

Nothing can be trusted price wise while there is over 5 minute trade lag.

**Original Release, not doctored. Unless Mt. Gox changed the release from the original, your .01 BTC are safe...**
TOKYO - JAPAN - April 12, 2013
Resuming Operation: Now what?
As announced yesterday, ( we have decided last night ( to shutdown all trades for 12hrs. This decision was made based on two major factors.
1) Trade Engine Lag
We have seen an astonishing growth in both volume and number of people joining Mt.Gox and trading on our platform. While we were ready and expected to see the number of new customers and trade rising, we did not anticipate such AMAZING growth that has been partially translated in visible and unbearable trade engine lag.
To fix this issue, we decided to make some major changes in our hardware infrastructure. It is now capable of handling 50 times more of the trades than in the past, giving us more time to release our new and improved trade engine, which is scheduled to be launched within a month.
2) DDoS
We have seen our fair share of DDoS attack in the past, but the shear volume of the DDoS we received in the past couple of day was rather important with a peak at 80Gbps. Despite our service provider's best effort, we had a lot of difficulties to handle both our user growth and the DDoS.
What’s next?
Technically speaking, we are now ready to better handle our exchange's rapid growth and assure normal operation. As far as the DDoS are concerned, we are still fine-tuning our security features and actively working on implementing a solution that will drastically protect us from such huge attack in the future.
But rest assured that we are taking this situation very seriously, and that we are doing everything in our power to protect the Exchange and your trade from such attacks.
Even as we speak, we are still being attacked by a yet unknown group of people that have clearly an intention in hurting Mt.Gox and Bitcoin as a whole. But rest assured that we are not giving up and are dedicated to win this, one way or another!
What will happen to all the pending trades?
This has been discussed at length here at Mt.Gox. We have decided that we will not flush the order book before trading resumes. We have no intention in proactively clearing people’s order regardless of what’s happening, and we will let people be the judge of what’s best with their order.
There is no doubt that we are expecting a violent crash of Bitcoin after trading resumes, but we are confident that this Panic Sell will be temporarily and that Bitcoin will rise again.
Also active immediately, we will waive all trading fees for the next 48hrs (Starting from 11am today JST).
Again, thank you for your continued support. Despite suffering one of the most impressive DDoS that we ever seen, we are doing everything in our power to overcome this situation and to restore stability and confidence in our exchange.
Regards Mt.Gox Co. Ltd Team.

Eleuthria has stated that he'll kill the getwork on BTCGuild if it hits 51%, which will kill 15% of the hashing power. He won't be malicious with it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:59:48
I always drew trends based on the low points, which you bypassed a whole lot of, but still in the general area. If I was to guesstimate without actually drawing the lines, it looks to be about 60-65'ish imho.
edit: After I typed that out, I checked bitcoinity's 12 hour charts &amp; the low was $65 after it came back up, but dunno how long it was there for.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:44:59
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:47:36
Like if they had a plan to prevent that from happening? Kinda like this? What a terrible guy he is.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:28:28
Wait, so our was the cause of the crash and is connected to the big banks? lolwtf
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:25:29
It wouldn't have to be that massive an increase for them to be using a few ASIC's, but  shows that even though the hash rate has increased, it's not on the order of a couple of BFL ASIC's magically working.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:03:22
Looks like you've stopped dispensing the test BTC, but from what I can see going through the history, you've got a very, very, very, very good chance to win the pot by being the highest bidder.
Someone with a lot of BTC could easily end up cleaning everyone out just based on the small sample size presented so far.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:10:14
Because Mt. Gox is closed for trading at the moment and the price isn't accurate?

Eventually people will learn to stop clicking links they don't recognize. Right?
Wasn't another hack perpetrated through BTC-E's chat box just a day or so ago?
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:22:28
Of course, but from the small sample size, there was over 80% chance of winning just by being the largest bid. Lots of room for gaming the system for someone with a big wallet. The odds may even out over time, but it's not looking good so far for the little guys at launch from what I see in this beginning sample size..
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:37:02
no problemo!
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:12:13
They have plans to shut down 15% of their hashing power if it gets that close. As it sits now, they're at 36%, a far cry away from 51%. Educate yourself.

Only if people stop mining because the price dropped. Difficulty is determined by total network hashrate, not price.

An ASIC for Litecoin would have to be specfically designed for Litecoin. Current ASIC's can't be used. 
Short description why here 
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:35:08
This isn't MtGox that got compromised, the user did. But yes, it needs to be be seen.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:04:14
Except you got successfully trolled by im14

People use blockchain's charts, which are skewed to the most recent blocks solved within the last 24 hours I believe, giving us misleading charts that people freak out over.
If you want pretty charts, use  or your links paint a similar story. BTCGuild is quite a ways away from having 51%.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:26:53
That's why the DDoS'ers leave it be, so they can troll box infect everyone. :D
@_date: 2013-04-05 11:47:43
Don't use blockchain's chart as it's susceptible to churning out numbers as above if a pool has good luck solving blocks like BTC Guild when this chart was made.
Use  which contains data from the last 2016 blocks.
They're still a bit away from 51%.
Edit: Before anyone goes all Chicken Little from now on, look for disclaimers such as the one on the chart linked. ****The graph below shows the market share of the most popular bitcoin mining pools. It should only be used as a rough estimate and for various reasons will not be 100% accurate.****

Here's the command line I use for rpcminer when connecting to slush's pool.
C:\miners\rpcminer nvopt&gt;rpcminer-cuda.exe -url=api.bitcoin.cz:8332 -user=your.workername -password=yourpassword 
That is for an Nvidia video card. If you have another card, use rpcminer-opencl.exe instead.
There are other options you can set, but that should get you connected and hashing at least.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:03:33
Sure, I'll give it a whirl
