Here, I fixed it for you guys.
Just type/copy this into your browser console:
    $('body').css('-webkit-transform', 'rotate(0)');
    $('body').css('position', '');

This is a really stupid statement.
If you think the block chain is the technology of the future then why are you not using it on day to day bases, trying to improve it and building a business on it?
All you do is speculate on the price, which helps no one in the community.

This is exactly how I feel. Since learned in school I wanted to know how financial markets in real-life work. As a poor college student I never had the chance to take part in trading real stocks.
Now, since I'm interessted in bitcoin I learned so much stuff around it and money itself.
Also as a CS student I can easily take part in implementing something with bitcoin given the awesome libraries.
I LOVE every single aspect of bitcoin.
It's the whole system of money given to US, the people, and not to some shady ass bankers that can do what ever the hell they want with our money.
It's transparent, it's easy to use, it's programmable and it offers so much innovation to come!
Also, the community is just so awesome. I'm registered on bitcointalk and really love it. It's that kind of forum that gets never old reading and people are really supportive when it comes to helping people out.
Its the kind of technical stuff that really changes your life as a tec enthusiast.
The last time I felt that kind of excitement over a technology was when I heared that you can programm your own apps for a phone and use the internet on it. (2007 iPhone announcement)

I registered my account on 19.11.13 on mtgox.
I just checked if my account is included in the balances file, and its not.
Are there any other people that are not included?
How did you find out your ID.
I was checking my emails for my confirmation email from mtgox.

An idea is absolutely worth nothing when you can't build a great company out of it.
As for Mark, he's a genius and even if he had stolen the idea everything after that is well deserved.
