"Just don't sleep tonight and you'll be all right."
These idiots think that it's a matter of doing *one* all-nighter. What they fail to consider is that it could take several days for trading to come back on. And I *would* set an alarm to wake me when the price moves one cent... **if the api was still functional.** Any app that tracks bitfinex price is somewhat unreliable to detect when trading goes online. 
And that's assuming bitcoin trading is all you do, that you have 24/7 access to the internet, etc.

That's me, correcting someone on a misconception they had about bitcoin, in SubredditDrama. They said that $100 would get them 0.000001 bitcoin and that they would need to buy expensive mining hardware to use it. And that those were the two reasons they could not take bitcoin seriously. I corrected them, stating $100 has never been less than 0.004 bitcoin and "saying you need mining equipment to use bitcoin is like saying that you need to work at the government approved money printing site, in order to use USD". Then I concluded stating my personal experience with bitcoin and the cryptocurrency markets.
They treated me as if I were a moonkid, or someone overstating bitcoin's benefits, shilling for it... I'll look for my original comment.

No matter. I'll take consolation is that this is something that's back on the table, and contributes to the health of the overall market.

I've always had trouble buying bitcoin. The market's dry in Guatemala, so I've had to buy at a premium with localbitcoin.com, and when I got to go a trip to the US, that really got my hopes up were the Bitcoin ATMs. I had no luck with this one ATM that needed my ID and to make an account. I tried three times, "Can't create your account, nope. Thanks for the images of your passport and those three selfies". Good thing I eventually found an ATM in New York. Printed a new wallet. Just pushed some cash into it, gave me a few bitcoin cents into my new wallet. Wiped it into Mycelium, and used it.
The market is still in infancy. Fact of the matter is that bitcoin is not easily accessible in more isolated markets.

And OP says the solution is in plain sight. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 18:45:47
Numbers 1 to 9 are inside the BTC symbol. 10 is outside, 11 and 12 are inside. The line between "code" and "easily" touches 1. if you extend the line between "early" and "attack", it touches 2.
If your pairs touch 1\-12 when connected or extending the lines that connect them... You might have the order of the pairs. Then, it might just take swapping the pairs' order and you'd be set ***if*** you have the right pairs ***and*** the right order of pairs... now you just have 48 possible combinations.

a) Depends on the person and crime. That's much too complicated to get into, we can talk all week about it. I believe we should always try to reform our prisoners, if they have an option for being freed.
b) We cant guarantee them jobs, does that mean we should not try to prevent further crime inflicted upon innocent people when we release the person? We're already paying for their food, medical treatment, shelter, etc. with our tax dollars, how about investing a little in prevention? Makes sense to me.
c) Imprisonment should have three purposes, punishment, removal of a dangerous element to protect the innocents, reform. For deterrent, the prevention of crime, and investment into reducing recidivism; respectively. That is my opinion. Imprisonment should not be merely about punishing people, that is not justice. Should we strive for justice in our justice system? As with point "a)", we can go into hypothetical situations all the time, but I believe some countries have done a more lenient prison experience... how has that effected people wronged and those related? Have revenge plots spiked? I think not. Is imprisonment punishment in of itself? Is it punishment enough? Maybe.

The thing is that bitcoin is highly divisible. One bitcoin is made of 10 million satoshi (if I remember correctly). So a milibitcoin (a one thousandth of a bitcoin) might be the one to stabilize near the dollar, one microbitcoin might stabilize at around a dollar! Anything is possible, those are very optimistic scenarios, with bitcoin stabilizing at 1 thousand and a million dollars. That might sound unreasonable, but they are well within reach. Anything can happen in the next 10 years. And I believe that there are a few hundred future millionaires holding under 10 bitcoin.

We do that through education of what it is, what other does and how we use it, as well as providing services and applications that help make bitcoin more convenient/easy to handle.

Funny story, I think I might have bumped into bitcoin and actually bought some in late 2009. I went to to the US for about a month for vacation. I was browsing the internet all day, watching anime and I stumbled on to a few channels that I still watch to this day. Mostly because the Youtube Algorithm would show me different thing due to geological location. 
It wasn't until 2014 that I stumbled on to It was [this]( advertisement that sparked my interest. It wasn't until March 2015 that I bought and started fumbling my first fractions of bitcoin. I now own 0.1 Bitcoin.
It may have take one small change in circumstances. One piece of advertisement... maybe I would have known about bitcoin in 2009. Maybe I would have looked into it in 2010 and I might have purchased some in 2011, with money from my first job. But that's just a bit of a dream. A hypothetical what-if. I'm going to hold on to my 0.1 BTC tight. Not fumble them. Hopefully that $600 worth of bitcoin now will be worth many more dollars, come 2026,

Gah, I wouldn't know much about Gdax's security in particular, sorry. I haven't used ether of them, but any exchange that lets you set what price you want to buy at is superior than one that just lets you buy at current market price, me thinks.
I mostly only use limit orders, because it's the most simple of the trading orders. I love being able to tell the exchange "I want to sell 0.01BTC if the price hits $5700" or "I want to buy 0.02BTC if the price hits $5200"

Electrum is a pretty good wallet to start out with. It's pretty much plug-and-play, when it comes to use. Just download, launch... and you should be ready to go.
Coinbase would not be optimal. I don't know for sure, because they've blocked Guatemala... but from what I could research, it seems you can only buy and sell at current price, which leaves you at a disadvantage. With that kind of trading, you'd need to be continuously logged in and very attentive to current price. Bitcoin's volatility is very much moment-to-moment. With bitfinex, you don't need to be so active all the time. That's where Limit Orders come in handy. When it comes to buying and selling, there are different types of orders that can help you set the rules you want for your buys and sells. Market, Limit, and Stop-limit are the ones I use and like the most. the TL;DR explanation for each is as follows
- Market: The current price is good for me! Hook me up with the current buy offer or sell offer. Sell/buy right now.
- Limit: There is a certain price I want to buy or sell at. When the buy or sell offer matches the price I've set to buy or sell at, the exchange will make that buy/sell for me. Buy/sell at the price I set, whenever it happens.
- Stop-Limit: If the price hits a price I set, create a limit order at another price I've set. 
These are available to you in Bitfinex.
... And lastly...


Yes. Ideally with bitcoin, because that way you can move bitcoin from one exchange to another in under an hour. The only issue could be transfer fees, but they're usually not too big.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:42:30
The thing about bitcoin is that its not ready to be a currency. It's just not ready. We're in the early days of this "new type of money", and time will tell whether it really works as a currency, economically speaking.
Mechanically speaking, it's about as good as cash. I have a friend in LA, I live in Guatemala. I can send them 0.05 bitcoin  (currently worth about $260) in 30 minutes, at the click of a button. If I wanted to send them $260 I have, I'd have to go to my bank, line up, then send them the money through moneygram. That should take me about an hour.
What I described in the previous paragraph is why I believe in bitcoin. There are things that need to be worked out, like price volatility, which isnt too good for currency. But it works, and it just needs to work for long enough to start accumulating users... and ideally, more users means more stability. An example I like to use is Netflix. Netflix wasn't ready to be the streaming service juggernaut it is now, back in 2001. But they developed a service that worked, and it kept working consistently... now it rivals DVDs, when it comes to home entertainment. 
I believe Bitcoin already rivals some fiat currencies, when it comes to worldwide usage. It's somewhere between the Zimbabwe dollar (practically worthless) and the US dollar (of considerable worth).
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:24:03
I wanted to chime in and say that it's like stock trading. Kings have been made beggars, beggars have been made kings. Everyone wants to be a successful trader. Not everyone gets to be.
Look, we might see the price drop back below $5000, and that might discourage people buying right now... but its the natural volatility of this generally new type of asset. And I think that those $200 you have might be enough for a nice return. You just have to be patient, and be wise. 
I applaud that you took a dive into it. Now you're asking very understandable questions when it comes to return on investment and in all reality... nobody knows. I have 0.08 bitcoin that use for trading, for two reasons. One, because I believe bitcoin has a prosperous future and I believe the price will ultimately go above and beyond. Two, because I am confident in my perspective and I trust myself to recognize when its wise to sell and when its wise to buy. And over these last few months, I have been trading well, increasing my holdings from 0.05 to 0.08 through trading alone.
I would be happy to share all the trading knowledge I have... but be warned, when you start trading, it can take a toll on you. You might spend nights wondering how you *could* have made a better trade, how you *should* have recognized the pattern, how you *would* have done better with the knowledge you have now. It's not for everyone... and it might be that I've just gotten lucky, and that luck is about to run out. But make no mistake, **as me anything**, I am an open book.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:07:07
I think the price should re-trace to $5300 soon. I would buy there. But be warned, it might drop lower than that... Be patient with bitcoin, and bitcoin will benefit you. My strategy is to buy, sell at a 10% increase in value, then buy back at a 3% drop... that seems to sorta work.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:17:36
There's Coinbase.com, Bitstamp.com, Localbitcoin.com, bitfinex.com ... some places are exchanges that need to verify your identity, and you have to transfer money to. I recommend googling up if there's a bitcoin ATM near you. Places where you can buy bitcoin usually have a minimum amount you need to buy, but it's rarely more than $100 for minimum purchase.
Be warned that bitcoin can have very high highs and very low lows. Bitcoin could drop down to $4500 in a few days, for all we know. Personally, I'm waiting for $5200 to buy back in.
Educate yourself before committing money to this market. Don't just trust what you hear from people on reddit. **Research**
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:10:59
BTC is too hot right now, I would buy if the price re-traced back to $5300 or lower... LTC looks ok, but I'd wait for $52, I think ETH might be too high, I would consider buying at $308.
Depending on how much you have, I would suggest you buy some of all three. Just dive into it. If you don't mind waiting some time to break even (because the price might consolidate for a while, under current price), I would split my buy into 70% BTC, 15%LTC, and 15%ETH.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:46:53
I thought you meant a one-time investment with 1-2% of your life saving. So, let me get this straight:
You're considering buying a set amount of bitcoin every month, equivalent to 1-2% of the money you set aside from your paycheck for saving? Sounds like a good plan. Would you just be holding them, or do you plan on actively trading them?
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:03:26
Imagine I had $1000 (USD) to invest into bitcoin. I would buy $400 worth of bitcoin **right now**, place a buy order for $100 at a price of $5500, an order for $150 at $5300, one for $200 at $5100, and one for $250 at $4800. That is, if I'm using an exchange that lets me place buy orders at the prices I want. 
If you're using an exchange that just tells you "current price is five-thousand-something, buy/sell", I would buy $1000 worth of bitcoin when the price hits $5300 or close enough.
How familiar are you with bitcoin and bitcoin exchanges?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:56:58
If you're really willing to put 1%-2% of your savings into bitcoin, I would say that you prepare swiftly. What I would do (given a max of 2% of my savings) is that I would buy 0.7% of my savings in bitcoin **right now.** I would then send 1.3% of my savings to a bitcoin exchange and put in buy orders at $5500 for 0.3% of my savings, $5300 for 0.3% of my savings, $5100 for 0.35%, and $4800 for 0.35%. I would wait a month before changing anything, giving the market enough time to set a top and a bottom trading channel.
That's what I would do. I'm curious, how much money are you considering putting in?
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:36:41
But how can bitcoin be real if our eyes aren't real? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:26:42
What I mean by trading is buying and selling, such that you sell at a high price to buy back at a lower price. Increasing ether the amount of USD that you have, or the BTC that you have. When it comes to a trading strategy, there's no such thing as "too simple", there's only "it works" and "it doesnt work".
Now, what you're proposing is what I like to call a "holders' strategy". Which, historically speaking... **it works**. I'm doing some quick math here, but if you had started the first week of 2014, you'd currently be holding 6.04 bitcoin, possibly more (I did 1200/900+1200/400+1200/800+1050/5000, that gives me a conservative estimate of how many bitcoin you would have purchased by now). That would be a $32,030 payday for a $4650 investment over three years and ten months. But keep in mind that you would have been in the red for most of that, you would have broken even sometime 2016. Holding works, but people tend not to like the waiting. And its not the most efficient strategy. **In summary**, I believe it is the safest strategy, but it's long-term in nature (you can spend up to two years in the red) and it's efficiency is medium. If you're OK just letting your bitcoin essentially sit there for years on end, I would recommend just buying at whatever price it is, every 2 weeks. *An essential part of any strategy is consistency*.
What I do... I like to call it "brute force" trading. I use margin trading, and I trade a swap... which complicates the explanation a bit... but long story short, I have a set amount that I buy or sell every 2%-3% (it was every $100 when it was below $5000, now it's every $200). So, for example, I sold $30 worth of bitcoin when the price hit $5800, and I bought $30 worth of bitcoin when the price hit $5600, and the sell order for $30 at $5800 is back up. If the price gets below $4500, my buy orders will be bigger than my sell orders, if the price is over $6000, my sell orders will be bigger than my buy orders. Fairly simple, not much though or consideration needed, that's why I call it a "brute force" approach to trading.
If you want to get started in trading, you probably can right now. Bitfinex is a pretty good exchange for a quick sign-up for trading bitcoin.

I thought to myself "given that I don't have a pre-existing account in money transfer services, how does cash compare to bitcoin?" 
To me, bitcoin is a better choice when I need to transfer money to a peer outside the country, when it comes to time. USD are still more practical for use (well, it depends on what they want to use the money on), but they're a slower transfer.

I still don't see how that has anything to do with bitcoin itself. The bot can use satoshi, nanobitcoin, bits, microbitcoin, milibitcoin, hundredths of bitcoin, or bitcoin. They are all subdivisions of the same thing. If you leave because the bot arbitrarily chooses a bitcoin subdivision, you know nothing of bitcoin's potential as a new technology, you know nothing of what's going on.
If a bot arbitrarily choosing a subdivision scares you off of bitcoin, I'm sure the whole movement is better off without you 
@_date: 2018-07-09 05:32:17
Years after the halving have been exceptionally bullish. 2013 and 2017 were both historic years and post-halving years. Although it's only happened twice, I think it's safe to say that bitcoin will see another ATH (All Time High) set on the post-halving year of at least one magnitude larger than the last.
It happened in April 2013 when the $220 was almost one magnitude larger than the ATH of $35 set in 2011, and the $1100 ATH of 2013  was over an order of magnitude larger than the 2011 ATH.
You see 2017, same story. Flew past the $1100 ATH, to $19800 (a little over $20k in some exchanges). I'm thinking $100,000 by Nov 2021 at least.

I've taken it upon myself to hand out information in this thread. Like cheap candy. Because I blindly stumbled into bitcoin, I want to help anyone interested in bitcoin that might have stumbled on to it here. Personally, I recommend and bitcointalk.org. They're good at explaining things if you ask respectfully. I can answer questions, but I'm no pro (despite 2 and a half years experience in bitcoin)
Well, I dont know much about investing ether :P... but I *do* have reasons. Primary one of which is that I believe in bitcoin, so I'm always looking to buy in. I have some of my bitcoin stash that I'm never selling, and I have some that I sell when there is a big movement up... like now (well, I don't operate *exactly* like that, but it's a close enough approximation, I guess). Bitcoin saw a ~20% increase in value in about 2 days ($4700-$5800), that usually doesn't happen without the price correcting downwards. I sold at about $5700, and I want to buy back at $5200 because its roughly a 10% decrease from the top. So that's where I want to buy back in.
As you can see in [this price chart for Bitstamp.com (exchange)]( the price has rallied hard and corrected hard. Specially this year (if you click on 12h, you should be able to see most of this year, depending on screen resolution), bitcoin has had a clear uptrend. But sometimes bitcoin can over-extend into bubble territory, like it did in 2013. That year, it rallied from $100 to $1000 and everyone was saying $10,000 was the price 2014 would be at... but the price crashed **HARD**. The market went into a hard downtrend, it crashed from $1000 to $200 over the course of 2014 and a slow recovery happened in Jan 2015- March 2017. You can see the entire price history on that chart if you click on 1w.
We're rallying hard, but I don't think we're in quite at bubble territory yet, although, I would be cautious if we got near $8000 this year. So... yeah. Feel free to ask any questions.

I dont pretend that my bitcoin are gonna be worth millions, I would suggest anyone that currently has bitcoin to hold, because (I guess, it is my opinion) it is gonna continue to creep up (with bumps along the way) until it reaches 500. 500 is gonna be this year's high. As for after this year... I dont know.

I first decided to buy bitcoin because it was something new. A few weeks ago, I bought $60 of bitcoin. Ever since, I've been reading and learning about it.
I think it will succeed because of how immediate and final bitcoin transactions are. Because you can send them from one corner of the world to the other without middlemen. I think it will succeed because our future is digital, our *present* is digital. Our credit and bank accounts are merely information stored somewhere.
I hope it succeeds because I want to be one of the first to pick it up. I want to look back and say "I helped start this trend".

Its possible, but I would guess that the likelihood is about the same as being attacked by a shark, hit by lightning and winning the lottery at the same time.

Every transaction ever faces similar risks.
Nice paranoid fantasy you got there. Tell me, how is a cash transaction any less vulnerable to that scenario? It's not. So, I can ether use a digital bitcoin transaction (available in localbitcoin.com) and risk less, or go face to face and risk more.
Imagine the guy shows up. I ask "did you bring your ID?", before making the transaction, I take a picture and send it to myself. Sure, what you said *might* happen. The guy *might* have a fake ID, and track me for hours (days?), just to grab me up and force me to make a bitcoin transaction back to his wallet. The likelihood of it happening? My guess is small.

So... these are being sold at (starting price) $5 each BTC?

This is exactly why I think this "paper money" thing is gonna fail. How does it work, anyways? Gold being kept somewhere? I dont get it. How many papers is my chicken *really* worth? Which papers to accept? The ones with the $ or €?
I'll stick to easy, convenient, reliable and automatic trade, thank you very much.

It means you give him(?) Bitcoin *and* hand over 240 dollars.
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:22:04
And that's why you dont have someone else handle your bitcoin. You are responsable for your own wallet. What you're talking about is a security issue brought on by user incompetence. Same as when people leave their coins on the exchanges.
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:50:40
Overprotective parents, man. I understand them, but come on! Yeah, personally, I think some people have reached proper maturity since 15. Some stay incompetent, immature idiots. Its strange that we as a society arbitrarily chose 18 years for "adulthood" to happen.
@_date: 2015-02-25 14:39:13
That's why we cant have nice things. Fuck the puritan society we live in. Any man that's been 14 knows that they got their hands on porn at that age.
I remember having to frequently lie in forums in order to discuss, ask questions, and seek advice. I hated that.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:14:50
I  got my bitcoins by using LocalBitcoin. All I did was make a bank deposit and move the bitcoin from their exchange to my wallet.
No problem there.

I have a cousin there, she's waiting to graduate highschool to get out... I'm worried for her despite the fact that she leaves in may.
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:33:27
Yeah, and the problem with forniture isnt "solved" with costly explosives from military contactors. The fact that the people are letting the government pretend (and promote propaganda that convinces the uneducated masses) that enough bullets, missiles and drones will solve the problem... is rather disturbing.
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:59:09
People have lost money, people have made money. As with any type of volatile investment, bitcoin has "taken" and "given" money to many.
The **price trend** over the last month and a few weeks is up. Ever since the $170 price, bitcoin has been inching upward.
@_date: 2016-07-25 18:14:50
Maybe people can be convinced to testify that cars are not money if given a car? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:41:53
I was there, it was horrifying. And brutal seems like an understatement.
I placed longs that I had averaged down to $6k-ish (average entry was $6200 at liquidation)... It made my day seeing I got represented in this gif. Then I remembered I lost 90% of my stash :(
It wasn't money I couldn't afford to lose, so I'm doing OK IRL...
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:05:08
I actually added to my long. It hurt to have a base price of $2300 when the price was $1820. But I held strong. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 13:46:01
I hear coinbank is a good alternative. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 13:49:44
Yeah, I wanted to pay for a $12 membership on a certain website. But I could only spend bitcoin at the moment.
Then I fapped to the samples and went on to do other stuff.
@_date: 2016-07-26 00:21:30
Can you do the same with bitcoin? Adoption is more favorable for the car, I'd say. I think I'd have an easier time trading a car fraction equivalent to a meal at my local restaurants than bitcoin. 
I mean, I can see how bitcoin can be considered money by any dictionary's definition. It obviously is. But legally, it's a debate with no clear answer. I could see it go ether way in any court, for a myriad of reasons. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:01:50
Have you even seen the price trend over the last month?
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:52:08
Huh. I did not know that... 
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:05:23
Aha. Now look at the trend.
Edit: the 2h interval should ilustrate what I'm saying.
@_date: 2016-07-26 00:04:34
Let me tell you a story. When I first bought bitcoin, I went to a HYIP.  Because it was something I could try out bitcoin with and (according to the promises the website owners didn't keep) make a profit. Lost $40 of my $70. I did something stupid. I don't blame bitcoin for it, and I've grown. I'll never fall for that kind of scam ever again. I saw then that bitcoin worked fine. The transactions I sent them confirmed relatively quick, I could check the status of transaction, and it was final. It was just a user error to trust people that promise a guaranteed 95% profit after a month.
If bitcoin is a scam, so is cash. No two ways around it. The only way you can lose bitcoin is the same ways you lose cash (not securing it properly or trusting it to people that lose/steal them). No two ways about it.

It was attrition. That's how.
^(at least, that's what I *think* attrition means) 
@_date: 2016-07-26 12:50:05
But ethereum is now two!? Oh, I'll never get the hang of this. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:33:05
That's why I think bitcoin will thrive in a large market (not completely mainstream, but popular). It's instant and final. Yeah, you *could* have to wait 6-8 confirmations for safety, but after that, it's set in stone.
