Just think that this guy doesn't appear too happy if he seems already addicted to day trading... If I would be him, just focus on traveling :)

Stop checking your blockfolio every 5 minutes and you might don't need any

The guy's story starts at 1:20
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:44:34
Yes true too, but as you guessed from my currency, I am expecting panic sells soon as the topic is very sensitive right now. I will buy anyway more, just feels better for under 3k€
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:42:14
Why 
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:54:32
I was trying to purchase lots of IOTA with my credit card today. Rejected 2 times. I called and ended up being connected with payment processing company for Visa and they told me it was just blocked for security reasons. She unlocked it for 24h and few minutes later it worked. So maybe she messed up xD

Hahaha it's funny how ignorant you are towards technology which threatens your own agenda (like bcash shill). While you're try talking progress down, in the background, one of the strongest protocols of machine payments is being developed..

You're clearly in resignation phase :) 
@_date: 2019-08-14 10:18:44
Disagree... Regression is about to start. Don't have the source right now (on mobile in my lunch break) but inflation is exponentially growing in US, real estate bubble is in Europe, give it max one year and you feel the depression/regression

Tell me why claims are wrong? Just because it didn't scale to a network size where it reaches this doesn't mean it cannot archive it... You behave like the people talking shit about engines while sitting on their high horse �� 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:14:47
Thanks for the info. Where are you located? Maybe that could be the reason? It's via coinbase, should work World wide. Maybe you see it at checkout? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:24:48
!FUCK 5 Thanks man for the kind feedback! Anything to improve? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:11:40
Why is that? I mean I clearly see every time dumps like today happen I cannot sell and also get internal error. But I am glad because now it's back to 6000€ and I almost sold at 5800
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:03:20
What does this imply? I mean are they all dumping bitcoin before or after the fork? And does it make sense to hold on to 2x coins or should I sell them asap? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:40:13
Awesome!!! They looks beautiful! We also like to spread awareness - feedback ist very welcome. Check it here

@_date: 2017-11-10 20:17:32
I'm crashing your garage sale post to join in with being a merchant myself. I do what I can to spread awareness. What do you think? Feedback is highly appreciated  
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:21:36
Like!! Made these to spread awareness as well  Tell me what you think? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:53:07
I did now! I use mycelium gear and you can pay p2p. What do you think? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:16:56
For more than 2 weeks now 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:53:12
Weird, I paid 0.01USD transaction fee like 2 days ago to move 6USD from my tenx wallet to a bitpay wallet of a friend... Maybe use sedwit?

I have also exact same problem? Can we ping them to reply here and help us out? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:37:53
Thanks a lot for your help! I think that's even better - will change it 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:07:54
Please, I support your view but had no option of doing so with shopify.. How can I set this up and I will
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:31:38

What is the best thing to do if you hold Bitcoin Core and are against 2X? I still have coins on blockchain.info!
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:19:36
Thanks for replying though and I really see you believe your points, but that has nothing to do with FACTS. you pick one incident and generalize it to the whole population.. And no, I'm not to argue with you either...
Do yourself a favor and double check the sources your getting your information from.. It is so biased... We have almost no gun victims in Europe because of gun rights.
Yes, illegal immigration is a problem, I agree but immigration generally is not!! With Trump in power, no one has the chance to become legal. I know what I'm speaking of since we once had a person in power very similar to Trumps mindset, luckily he killed himself in '45...too late though
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:43:41
Okay just that you might start to consider that you're soo wrong and hope I don't argue with a bot now..
Abortion is every women's right and not killing a human in this early stage. You are most likely male, so consider you were not and have been raped (and no - not by immigrants), then you wouldn't want to give birth either. Illegal immigration is causing no death besides the dead children in your camps set up by Trump, the people starving to death hoping for a better life. If you would have a good health care system like we do in Germany (something Obama wanted) it would be enough for everyone and not just for the rich.
And sorry, please explain me how gun control leads to more deaths??? �� �� You must be living in a bubble. That's like saying a speed limit on highways and a register for driving license is killing is leading to more accidents. Please help yourself!
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:51:12
Well if we use history to predict the future than just look at the halving chart and you will see where bitcoin will be around mid 2020
@_date: 2019-05-10 07:04:55
What a fucking stupid nonsense... hope you will one day wake up and realize the mess your government is and the pain it has brought to everyone in this world.
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:38:36
Hahahaha your username checks out.. FrustraTION, just don't know with what? That you missed the 3500$ BTC? or that you fail to accept that bitcoin isn't dead, bankster?
@_date: 2019-05-10 07:03:05
replace also with are. They are! At least their "leader" so called president behaves this way
