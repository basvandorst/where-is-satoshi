It's because it's one of the rare occasions where the good guy wins

Don't worry buddy, bcash bots got your back :)

They just need to regulate the exchanges.

If it says "BTC" it's the real Bitcoin, if it's "BCH" you bought Bitcoin Cash.

Sorry, but this video is very long and there is a lot of technical talk that I don't understand.
I rather go to and read about conspiracies which are really thrilling and use simple narratives of good vs evil, so that even a little dumb dumb like me can understand how it ***actually*** works.
This Anton dude in the video has no credibility at all. But Roger is called Bitcoin Jesus for a reason ;)
Also he is kinda cute. bcash all the way!
P.S. Pls don't confront me with any arguments or facts, or I will remove this comment and make a post in btc how I got censored cuz u shills couldn't handle the truth! Peace

Not just BCH, but all Alts. In anticipation of the hardfork people trade their BTC to alts and wait for the crash, and switch back right after.

Well if they want Bitcoin, they are going to buy BTC - not B2X (which will initially be the label for the new fork).

Simply not true, lol. 




It just ensures that they don't get sued for their own innovations. 
Nice FUD though, and you didn't even use the word "shill" once, very impressive.

It's mind boggling how many people don't get it, I thought it was pretty obvious.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:38:53
Yeah I noticed it too late, sorry. Left it 'cause relevance.

S2x supporter only spread bullshit and conspiracies, because they lack any objective facts which support their argument. 
But what do I know, I am writing from a 2-day old reddit account.

The article you linked is about **Segwit**, not **Segwit2x**!
[You can read Bitcoin Cores actual stance on Segwit2x here.](

You are making a bunch of bullshit claims and assumptions with zero evidence.
Sorry, I won't waste my time trying to convince somebody who thinks that a lot of forks imply that the original repository is "just absolute shit". It's like saying that there are so many counterfeit Nikes from China, because real Nikes are "absolute shit".

lol. Yeah, Bitcoins code is so shit, that everyone copies it. Dat logic.
