Too many people are treating bitcoin as a get rich scheme. It's unsustainable.

Should we stop "should we stop "should we stop" posts" comments?

The difficulty only goes up though.

Maybe it isn't a pyramid scheme in the traditional sense. Yet, people still are treating it like a get rich scheme. People buy Bitcoin and then hold it increasing the cost of Bitcoin and try to entice more people to buy Bitcoin, so that the value of their Bitcoin can increase in value. Then they convert it to fiat. It's not sustainable and it isn't what Bitcoin was meant to be. Bitcoin was meant to be a currency, that means people are supposed to purchase things with it and pay people for services with it, Etc. I have seen people ridicule others for using Bitcoin as a currency, they tell them things like "You should've just hodled!" What is the purpose of Bitcoin if people only hold?

Bitcoin is more than an ark is like a duckboat stocked full of supplies if needed it doesn't need a flood to work, yet it was designed so that it could work in one.

The issue is that too many people are treating it like a pyramid scheme. The goal of bitcoin wasn't to be a get rich quick scheme.

What the fuck fees are you paying that I'm not?

But if you know that you know less then by gaining that knowledge are you really gaining knowledge because you lost knowledge by knowing more?

This is wrong, I have a PayPal simply for buying things online. It's so much safer and convienent than having your payment method freely available on any site.
