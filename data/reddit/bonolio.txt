Bear tried to game the system.
The system gamed him.

It occurred to me that I really was against the the whole idea of these leaks. I talk about privacy all the time and this was most certainly a major breach of these girls privacy.
On the other hand, I really want to see the pictures.
This would make me a hypocrite.
On the other hand , having a look would change nothing in the big picture and would really be a pointless gesture to satisfying own sense of integrity.
In the end I decided I could never have an expectation for anyone else to ever turn their back on these leeches if I can't exercise this small act of willpower.
Hope this doesn't mean I need a fedora

It's really not that amazing that they are scared. 
Either Bitcoin or some other crypto currency has the potential to become a big player in the financial systems of the future.
MasterCards whole business model is based on being the middle man in a world where electronic currency is far more useful than paper bills.
Cryptocurrency brings the person to person transactions of paper money to the electronic world.
With every new p2p technology comes a scared middleman trying to protect his profits.

And if get hit with conversion fees from fiat to BTC and back at least I know up front what the fees are.
The mysterious disappearance of random percentages along the route of an international transfer are ridiculous.

I in no way think of you poorly, you are obviously a discerning individual who knows where his Bitcoins and Towel are.
I personally would ~~be dubious~~ not think twice about ~~giving myself money~~ placing Bitcoins in need in my custodianship.
Edit: for Clarity

Reddit Gold also pays for Reddit.

[Society for the Preservation of Bitcoins](
With all of the hype and optimism surrounding the recent spectacular growth in bitcoin many of us have forgotten the hidden tragedy that is occurring all around us.
Every minute bitcoins are being lost and abandoned by careless or apathetic owners.
Once a bitcoin is lost, it is gone, never again to frolic freely in the block chains of the virtual landscape.
I have founded the Society for the Preservation of Bitcoins, our mission is to provide a loving and caring refuge for your unwanted or unloved Bitcoins.
To ensure your bitcoin have a home where they will be loved and cared for please send them now to
Remember, Bitcoins are information and information wants to be free

I would like to suggest Unicode Character 2195 as the BitCoin symbol

Might I also suggest selling bitcoins.
If you have the need to converting BTC back to USD you can offer over the counter BTC for Cash. Gives your customers a convenient way to top up their wallets as well as giving you a way to convert to cash at a small profit rather than probably having to pay some withdrawal processing fee

I hear a lot of folk talking about bitcoin as the new world currency, something that will do away with the currencies of the past.
Many others speak it's doom and go on about it being a speculators fad.
To be honest it is probably always going to be more convenient for me to deal day to day in local currency but I believe bitcoin will stabilise and fall into everyday boring use as a cross border currency.
It has flaws, it has it's benefits and the world will adopt it for the tasks that it is suited for.
Businesses will accept it and people will continue to use it for day to day things but it's strength will emerge as a lingua franca of currency.

I have a shorthand that I use with friends when discussing BTC values.
0.1 BTC = 1 * 10^-1 BTC = 1BTC1
0.001 BTC = 1 * 10^-3 BTC = 1BTC3
0.000001 BTC = 1BTC6
1000BTC6 = 1BTC3
I say 0.00023BTC as 23Bit5
This probably would not work for most folk but I find it to be a very precise way of verbally dealing with problem.
23BTC4 + 23BTC5 = 230BTC5 + 23BTC5 = 253BTC5 = 0.00253BTC
