Bitcoin is going mainstream a little too quickly. We should be at this point once lightning network comes along

I really don't understand why everyone on this subreddit is freaking out about apple pay (not suggesting you are OP, just referring to a lot of posts I've seen). ApplePay is definitely not going to kill bitcoin, it's probably going to suffer the same fate as google wallet, aka useless if you don't live in the U.S., like 95% of the world's population. Bitcoin is without borders or regulation, there's no way apple pay will kill it.

I still have a block eruptor mining for me! May as well plug it in and wait.
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:50:16
That's a shame. I had high hopes for these guys. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:38:24
I have not met a single woman who knows about Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:59:36
I think having it called that might attract more people 
@_date: 2014-09-07 20:10:07
I'm sure the North Korean government will be more than happy to convert to bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:28:49
They dont have to explain how bitcoin works
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:59:30
Technically speaking you aren't buying bitcoins, you're buying the second life currency. Which is basically like buying credits for a facebook game or any MMO or something. Paypal shouldnt even know that you're converting it to bitcoin, as far as they know you just play second life. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:47:16
1 is getting me about 0.01 every 3 months!
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:55:55
Once I get to the point where I can withdraw the bitcoins again (when I mine 0.01) I'll probably stop mining. Eruptors are more of a souvenir now than an actual miner. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 23:37:19
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:04:24
Maybe it's off. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 01:22:07
Wow I already forgot about MTGox
@_date: 2014-12-26 21:36:42
Don't you understand that all white people hate bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:57:38
Does this automatically happen when I pay with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:49:14
unless you aren't in the U.S.
Then it's the easiest way. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:07:46
They've been playing the long con
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:23:54
If anyone know, no one would be buying
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:22:40
Only if they sell
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:05:07
It could've been the old multibit wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:04:11
It's supposed to be (from what I've seen) normal bitcoin however it can be mined by GPUs again, instead of dedicated ASIC's which is needed to mine bitcoin now. It's a cool idea sadly there are some sketchy things going on with the coin (The devs premined the coin to "fund" the project). 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:43:21
You should have told her you were the CEO
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:42:14
You should probably ask @_date: 2017-10-25 15:01:40
Just make sure to do serious research into any alts you buy, ~~some~~ many end up being scams. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:57:00
5 years is a long time
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:26:49
Yeah I should probably add that to the main post. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:03:25
If I don't use CIBC can I still pay with it?
Also they got rid of their interac option. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:47:47
I am the 4.2%
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:23:38


Unfortunately, I have neither.
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:31:23
Alright, I guess I'll have to give that a shot the next time Im near a CIBC. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:16:43
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:15:43
I checked LibertyBit and all there is is an option to deliver cash to the bank, I dont see any e-Interac transfers. 
But I'll check out btcQuick. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:19:10
How does someone use that QR code to buy something? Wouldn't they have to go home to their computer to send the money?
Sorry I'm relatively new to bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:27:02
Thanks! I'd tip you but any bitcoins I potentially have will be in this wallet, so you'll have to wait to see if I actually have any!
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:25:11
Ohh cool! 
I'll be sure to check it out on wednesday
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:52:21
Except that doesnt work in Canada :/
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:25:56
I'm actually looking to sync my wallet to access any bitcoins I might have inside. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 06:21:44
You should come to Canada. 
Our cities are so far apart the closest one to me speaks a different language. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:54:36
But I'm no where near a bank. 
It's going to cost me more money in gas to get there than it would be if I just paid the $30 fee to wire the money to Bitstamp or whatever. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:39:02
Libertybit seems to be shutting down some of their services... Maybe its best to avoid them?
@_date: 2013-06-15 06:00:14
Yeah there was a PSA a day or so ago about how bit instant isnt responding anymore. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:05:30
Yeah it's really annoying, I hope theres an easier way soon. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:28:59
Cool, let me know!
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:39:19
As much as I hate this show, it would bring a lot of publicity
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:51:54
Yeah I was going to check out BitVegas, but I kept forgetting!
@_date: 2013-06-10 03:34:59
My bank is an online bank, I can send it without going to the bank. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 06:23:03
Worst you could remember is capped connections?
I still have capped connections... 
@_date: 2013-06-15 17:48:17
I can't exactly afford a new phone, so all I have is my old iPhone 3g and even though its jailbroken I cant find a single way to use bitcoins on it. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 05:35:08
I had that too, probably an nvidea 550 or something. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 22:29:02
We should start a club. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:53:51
I have an account and it says I need ID and a scanned utilities bill
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:52:13
I just signed up and I only see an option to pay in person at a bank. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:03:32
Oh cool! Maybe I could buy some off of you then? 
How exactly did you sell them? 
@_date: 2013-06-10 20:55:35
it seems like that's the only way...
Sucks. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:40:49
Since there is no receiving address apparently, I'm guessing that I have no bitcoins here.
Thanks for your help anyway!
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:01:46
Like I said above, I'm quite far from the bank. It would be cheaper for me to just wire the money to bitstamp or whatever than it would be to drive there. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:26:44
Tell me about it...
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:06:49
dogecoin is no play money. dogecoin is future of world. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 01:24:51
I know I do!
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:53:54
Why is the picture Spirited Away? 
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:12:54
That sucks man! 
Hopefully one day there will be an easy way for everyone worldwide to buy bitcoins without any crappy fees. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:54:00
I just need to get the balance. 
I guess I should just get multibit or something and import the wallet to that. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 03:35:48
No, I don't even have a credit card. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 21:49:43
Theres no such thing as bad publicity, getting bitcoins on a large TV show, no matter how shit it is, is still good publicity. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:13:51
Why isnt there a way for me to transfer my money from my bank account, like an e-cheque?
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:27:58
I see, I couldn't find the image on the page so I was very confused. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:26:24
I know its a stupid complaint, but its still annoying. 
Especially when you don't have a car. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:32:22
I wasn't expecting it to go anywhere. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:25:32
All Im saying is that it's a pain in the ass. I'm not expecting you to solve it or anything. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:45:55
Its a long shot but I guess I can check it out, where would I find this info?
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:43:30
The only thing I can think of is making it so I don't have to scan so many things to get my account verified. 
This is really just a problem with Canada, I have to scan a copy of my utilities bill (which I don't have) and give it to them. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 21:17:24
Shit. I'm assuming that this means that the site is going to be gone, unless whoever buys it decides to keep it running (not likely).
This sucks, theres already so few Canadian bitcoin sites. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:57:59
But I live pretty far away from a bank. I dont want to spend my whole day just going to a bank to deposit the money. 
It's ridiculous that I cant just buy a virtual currency online. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 07:03:56
Yes he was
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:00:25
Damn. 
Oh well, thanks anyway. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:56:41
That's not nice...
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:00:30
Yeah but its still very unnecessary. Why can't I just buy these online? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:25:07
That happened with me too! But fortunately for me I only bought 0.05... 
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:47:24
Yeah I know.  I was just pissed that every time I went to buy something they said I either had to go to the bank or scan documents that I dont have. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:21:33
Nope, I still live with my parents. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:53:22
I have an account and it says I need ID and a scanned utilities bill
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:49:43


@_date: 2013-06-10 15:41:24
And I just got an email from them saying that they're suspending their services...
@_date: 2013-06-15 18:16:43
OH cool I'll check that out
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:18:51
Oh wow thanks :D
@_date: 2013-06-10 02:14:07
I already blame harper for everything. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:41:31
Oh wow I can't believe I missed that haha. 
Hey I have 0.000048 bitcoins! Better than nothing I guess!
Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:11:27
Only one way to find out! 
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:57:26
Damn thats way too much, I'd be better off just sending a wire transfer.
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:53:54
I only see this under my addresses so I dont think there is one
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:15:08
about tree fiddy 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:54:31
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:57:05
Its not really that hard to get to a bank to be honest, its just a pain that I have to go all the way to one just to get bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-06-15 06:01:01
Ah. you probably should have mentioned that
@_date: 2013-06-10 02:19:42
Alright, I'll give it a shot.
Unfortunately everyone selling them seems to be selling them for 20% more than the price of bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:41:15
Yeah I'd probably go with a friend if I was meeting in person. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:28:23
Theres a lot of people in Canada who live no where near banks, its a big ass country. 
But I still feel like its so unnecessary to have to go to the bank just to buy bitcoins when I can buy things with paypal without going to the bank. Why bother using bitcoins if they're so much harder to use?
@_date: 2013-05-11 02:59:38
Fuck I wish I bought some back then...
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:27:29
bitinstant.com doent work in Canada.
EDIT: I mean take off as "become well known", I know like 2 people who know about bitcoin and they don't trust it at all. 
@_date: 2013-06-15 15:51:49
Why not do it all at once? 
@_date: 2013-06-10 19:31:10
I see. I'm guessing iPhones wont work?
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:52:17
With my bank account?
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:17:02
Holy shit .126 bitcoins is $50 now??? damn. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:58:30
Ive never seen this before, how do we connect and pay with bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:26:59
I can do that!?! 
how?
