I support the Core team and I love the second layer solutions but I don't understand why the block size increase has become so taboo. Even if the lightning network would be ready for use today we will still need more space on-chain for openning and clossing the chanels.
I remember a few years ago that everyone (Adam Back, Core devs, Andreas A.) was on board with a 2MB block and later a 4MB. What the hell happened?
I have not moved my coins for over a year until now when I'm trying to sell the BCH, and my god the fees are expensive. $8 fee and two hours later 0 confirmations.
All my friends that are just now getting into Bitcoin are a little disappointed after their first transactions. I think we are loosing a lot of users and for what?
I get the fundamentals and totally agree with bigger blocks = centralization, but 2MB/4MB is nothing, doesn't matter. Storage has become a lot cheaper, 1TB hdd today costs less than a 250GB hdd two years ago.
2MB block limit + segwit will let us breath a little

I agree. A 4MB limit would be perfect right now. This means around 6.8MB of data if segwit gets adopted by most of us. When LN comes it will take care of the small transactions but there will still be a lot of demand for on-chain transactions. If nothing else changes, only the limit, I don't see any political objections by nodes or miners to this HF.
PS: 1TB HDD costs $50, less than a 250GB in 2015 when almost everyone agreead on 4Mb blocks. Also, the internet speed has increased a lot since then (I have 1Gb/s at home). For god sake we are watching 4k youtube videos and live streams.

Correct. But, just the same, I am entitled to STOP using them or recommend them to other people.

Stick with BTC, the rest is just noise. Don't compromise yourself by promoting scams.
If you want to be a pioneer again, start accepting Lightning payments.
