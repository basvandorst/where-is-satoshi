Thanks, hodling seems like the best way to go.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:11:29
Thanks for the reply. Will take note of the strategy.

Thanks for the comment, I will definitely keep that in mind. I know I won't ever get to that size but in Turkey, one bitcoin is at the moment 56.6k in local currency. Yesterday it was 50k. So, Since 1 usd is nearly 4 in Turkish Liras, Even a 250$ change counts as 1k of local money. That is a lot for me and my family since both of my parents are retired. Most people living here only get paid 1.5k TL a month. Also I am not really talking about buying and selling in a hourly basis. 
But again, I will be sure to research more and more and get information about how asset trading works.

I really like how he suddenly wanted to be honest with the real reason to his approach against bitcoin. I think a lot of people do feel the same way as him. Personally I have been doing small transactions with my brother (I am in high school and he is in college right now) and many of my friends around say that it will be worthless soon and I am just wasting money on it. But on the meantime, I bought 0.3BTC in 7K$ (because I am turkish, that nearly makes 28000 Turkish Lira per bitcoin which is a lot). Now, it is just getting more and more reliable everyday. I think they are just not able to see the full picture of what bitcoin really is. I am really happy to do such an investment in such an early stage of my life though. Now my father is also investing in bitcoin and this month, we have paid my school tuition fees with the income we gained off bitcoin.

I am trying to explain. Hopefully the gain today will be enough to get him to hold.

My country does not have any taxes or regulations for bitcoin income tho.

So, I have been reading on the topic for a while, if more people HODL, the effect of futures will be less right?

You sir have earned a well earned place in my bookmarks bar. 
Thanks for every piece of information you share.

I agree, I have been trying to print out and file every price correction in the past 3 months and still did not find any reliable info within it.
I just asked in case someone had a strategy to invest in and out in such situations.

The fees are not a big problem for me. Since I live in Turkey, the local Bitcoin exchange gets the fees in Turkish. Considering that 1 BTC is 56.7k Turkish Liras, I am not really worried about that.
But thanks, will examine further on the exact ammount of fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:11:06
Thanks a lot man. I will definitely keep these in mind. I plan on selling 2/3rds of the Bitcoin I own in order to buy when the next price correction comes in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:17:26
So you say, Just HODL?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:23:16
Right now, In BTC turk which is a turkish exchange, bitcoin is 1k$ more than on coinbase. Unfortunately you need to be Turkish to sign up.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:55
Is this the price correction everyone is talking about? 
Right now, it went  below 9900$
When will it continue its rally then?

I SHAT MY PANTS ALMOST MAN

not sure about the 20k part but probably was an exaggeration. I am thinking it might hit 20k at the end of 2017.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:22:55
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:23:13
Lol. Great feeling but no. I am just trying to give out the positive mood around. When the price started to drop I felt like I fucked up.
It was not nice.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:52:45
I think we can now call this thread "9k Panic Thread"
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:52:59
Not very sure
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:29:02
It will go over 11k soon though no need to worry.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:53
above for sure. But also depends on where u live :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:24:19
I agree with you. The testing prices will probably increase with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:32:12
Right now all of my balls are shaking because of the drop in price
