Well i would like to get into some games, but all my GPU's are flat out mining at the moment.

People talking shit are everywhere you obviously believe in Bitcoin. So just ignore the shit talk and focus on the rest :-)

Its good you believe in the technology, and its super tempting to go all in when the market is bullish. But I think you need to liquidate some of your holdings if you don't have the stomach to lose it.
That way you don't have all your eggs in the one basket and you can relax and enjoy life. Bitcoin will still change your life for the better, but you wont panic every time some bullshit floats down the line from China.

Its not up to us to tell you what to do with your money. If you only care about the price feel free to move on. 
The crypto community already has enough market speculators, we need more people who are passionate about moving the technology forward.

Your an idiot we are back over $4k again. The correct course of action in fast moving market conditions would have been wake her up for quickie to take your mind off things. So you could get back to sleep again.
