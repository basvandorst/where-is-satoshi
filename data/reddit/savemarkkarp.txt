I see no purpose for developers. Why not spin it up yourself at 90% off? Even a self contained Bitnode is more than enough.

Don't worry guyz the Free Market will sort out bad actors like this

The best part? Microsoft, Newegg, et. al are using BitPay so if they go bust, I'm betting they will either switch to Coinbase or simply drop the option. Doesn't look good when your Bitcoin payment processor bites the dust due to lack of income.

I like how you pointed that out but didn't answer his question

Lol remember when everyone fellated 21 Inc over how it was going to be HUGE for Bitcoin? Just lol.

Bitcoin is a payment platform! No wait! I need it to be an investment for this argument! No wait! I mean its a currency!

People talk about LN solving the issue like its already done and out. It doesn't exist yet beyond prototypes and nobodys seen how it works beyond paper and speculation

To explain what the hell you burn your VC money on because this dumb Pi-in-a-shell thing sure as hell doesn't account for it.

haha, people in this sub give Apple so much shit about their fanboi's buying anything they put out, yet this group does the same thing with a Product thats blatantly a rip off PI with a mining chip on it.
A fool and his money...
@_date: 2015-09-28 21:21:09
Yes because as well all know, there is absolutely no manipulation of any kind at all with Bitcoin.

Really? Its because of this community.
Every time someone says they don't like Bitcoin or don't want to accept it, you guys handwave them off as "they clearly don't get Bitcoin!". Then you go on to berate them as "statists", "ignorant" and more. This is such a cop out to avoid confronting the issue of why people have such a negative view of it.
You act like fundamentalists. Seriously, when people say they're not interested, you counter with "Well soon it will be inevitable! You'll have to do it eventually anyway!". That sounds pretty familiar, I used to hear it from the nutcase religious folks who scream DO WHAT I SAY OR BURN IN HELL!
When places stop accepting Bitcoin because they get no sales after months, you call and harass them to death like a bunch of nutcases. What you did to was well documented and is basically why nobody wants to deal with you in a nutshell. That doesn't even include the places you scream and fight with to take Bitcoin when they say No (see the Upwork thread).
Customers don't give a shit about the Merchant. You need to eat a 5% fee? Welcome to the cost of doing business. And in most cases, they aren't passing the saving on to me anyway. I'm not going to care about chargebacks, I need consumer protections to avoid the shitshow this community has with rampant scamming, and in case its not wildly obvious by now, the whole "reputation" system isn't helping.
This community should take a harder look at themselves and realize they're not making any friends by acting like a bunch of rabid animals trying to force people into Bitcoin wherever they go.
Edit: Case in point, the top voted comment in this thread is someone talking about how people are "afraid of what they don't understand, they're just dumb"
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:04:23
Theres tons of Buttcoin threads about that. Recently there was a thread where someone said the Malleability attack was a problem for 0 conf acceptors and everyone responded with "Ur dumb, they just need to change wallet implementations!"

Except for the fact this hole has been open and known about for years.
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:55:24
Maybe not, but they're big on this subreddit and their posts regularly get voted to the top of the front page of this sub.

Re-read the thread. A few employees said no way.

I love that people consider this a legit scenario...
IN A WORLD...where people are constantly kidnapping others for their Bitcoins....

Bitcoin also gets plenty of valid criticisms that people refuse to acknowledge without people here going berserk

Oh wow a 30$ increase, must definitely be moon time /s
@_date: 2015-10-11 01:38:31
This sub is the worst. They say no, and instead of "OK, please consider in the future", you spam their forums, call them uninformed and harass them. And you can't figure out why everyone outside this echo chamber has the same opinion about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:06:39
You are literally why Buttcoin exists. To mock the elitist idiots who look down on hard working 9-5 people because you were lucky enough to get in at the ground floor of Bitcoin and act like you're so much smarter and better for it.
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:55:17
Theres a huge difference between "Advocating" and "if you don't accept Bitcoin I'm going to harass your business and call you an ignorant statist"
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:58:37
I figured my username alone would be a giveaway to that, but my points still stand about a lot of people jamming Bitcoin down peoples throats without being nice about it. Its just a huge turn off.
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:53:36
The downvotes speak volumes
