Everyone gets caught doing their dirt, eventually. Coinbase, your shady business practices will be detrimental to your ongoing prosperity. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:29:39
Yeah, because people never manipulate markets for profits, especially not the CEO of JPMorgan Chase!!!

@_date: 2018-05-23 14:03:03
Don't you guys think it's weird that every time his name is mentioned in a Bitcoin forum, you creepy fucks bring up his sexual tendencies? In all seriousness, why are you creepy little chuds so fascinated with what he does in his time with his lovers behind closed doors? And why do you creepy little chuds insist on bringing up his sex life in unrelated Bitcoin threads? Do you not realize that it makes YOU look bad and not him? You literally look worse than a man who gets shit in his mouth on purpose. How does that make you feel? Like shit?
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:57:51
How much money do you make?
How much money is in your bank account?
Aren't these typically considered "private" or "personal" questions?
@_date: 2018-05-26 03:06:49


That would have been much easier then doubling-down on the cuntiness. But hey, I get it. You have a huge ego and you're never wrong. Have a great day, big guy!
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:03:23


Well yes, that's true. Governments can access bank accounts, but it's still quasi-private.
What I mean is, I can't look and see that you have however many dollars in your bank accounts.
Conversely, anyone who has your wallet address can view your coin amounts and see how much money you have in that wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:03:45
It wasn't a comment about the dick thing, that's obviously bitcoin related. However, the shit eating comment from the documentary, which may or may not be true, has no place here and is only said to disparage someone. It's rude, and you're being a cunt by bringing it up.
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:45:40


So because *you* misspoke, I'm going "full retard"? Makes sense...
BTW, antivirus software *is* security software. Sorry you were confused, but you switched up the goal posts mid-stream, so I can understand where your confusion stemmed from.
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:12:57
I didn't hear that, but that's awesome as I like both of those coins! He mentions Monero in this video and I recall one of the first times I saw him tweet about crypto he mentioned Monero then as well. He seems to mention Monero the most from what I've noticed.

If there is one coin Mr. McAfee genuinely loves, it's Monero.
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:57:05


You were talking about McAfee antivirus product.


Now you are talking about his Everkey dongle, which is a hardware product.
I'm assuming you're the same Claymore that produced the mining software, so you should know better. I'm curious why you're intentionally playing ignorant now?
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:09:15
Did this 51% attack on Bitcoin Gold start before, or after SatoshiGold and Faketoshi had the argument at the conference where Craig Wright was booted out? Because it kind of seems like a petty revenge for this.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:02:53
Hey creepy little chud, why are you so fascinated with his sex life that you insist on bringing it up in unrelated Bitcoin threads?
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:24:45
I like the part where he pretends to be humble with the "eternal student" line, but acts like a cunt wagging his finger in peoples' faces at conferences and tells them he has more money than their whole country.
This guy seems like a ticking time bomb.

Your sources for that claim are third-world hookers in Belize who were paid to contribute a fictitious/slanderous documentary.
Regardless of the validity of the claims by Central American prostitutes, who cares what consenting adults do behind closed doors, and how does that relate to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:06:27
Heh, I wish I was John McAfee! But alas, I'm not, and you are still a creepy little chud more concerned about a random person's sex life than you are about Bitcoin. Try to stay on topic, creepy little chud.

Maybe I'm missing something, but Stocks and Bitcoin are two different tabs in my CashApp.

I don't know man... I click the chart icon at the bottom of the home screen and switch between the Stocks and Bitcoin tabs with no problem. It might not have been "obvious" enough for some, but I found it intuitive enough to find pretty easy.
Regardless, the stocks and bitcoin aren't in the same menu like the OP I responded to had an issue with.

I don't know how anonymous the nodes for the coins are, but the coins themselves are the best for privacy.
