leading coin to get into alts? They could be using ETH instead since it's faster and cheaper to get into alts. plus its listed on all the big exchanges and has the same pairs btc has.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:26:57
that is why I can't wait for them to add more crypto currencies. cheaper for everyone involved. 
you can't blame merchants for wanting to make a profit. You should be blaming the miners who are the ones making all the money.

I stopped using it well except for the stuck cold storage transactions I'm trying to convert to another coin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:23:07
isn't there way, way more longs than shorts? which has been going on for months now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:17:10
Most exchanges have added ALT to ALT pairs and ALT to USD pairs. BTC is not the only option anymore. I think there is even a token on ETH that allows many of the tokens that exist on ETH to be converted to one another without much effort.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:20:25
Also I'm more concerned about exchanges painting the tape. I have a feeling that is going on much more than spoofing.

Be their own bank? Bitcoin is like a single bank. What happens when everyone tries to withdraw their money?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:05:41
uh, duh do you think the majority are investing in it because they believe this will last long term? haha, they are investing in it short term to get rich.

Sadly, right after this photo was taken they tried to move that gold from the creek and were told by miners they needed to pay them a fee and that fee was all the gold they panned that day.  The end.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:23:00
it's impossible to trade anything anymore unless you have money sitting in one spot. all exchanges backed up can't withdrawal or deposit shit. The networks all backed up. everything is fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:57:12
but coinbase should rush it...

Gold is used way more than bitcoin. 
Almost everyone wants gold jewelry. Think about gold watches, gold rings, gold necklaces, gold ear rings, if you are married I'm sure you bought your wife or husband a gold ring. Think about how much gold India buys because their culture highly values it. Think about gold fillings and gold in electronics. Think about how many centuries gold has been considered valuable. 
Now say you had 1 ounce of gold or a gold ring and every time you tried to exchange or move it you lost a piece of that gold and it went back to the people who made that gold coin or ring to sell on the market. Eventually you will not have any gold left and that gold reentered the market making supply go back up. Why would people value it as much as they do now if they can't use it for anything at all and lose it if they do?
Bitcoin is not comparable to gold.

I think he was being facetious

we all know bitcoin will survive long term just like myspace did.

This article mentions nothing about GDAX or bitcoin. 
Some of those big walls are doing what is called arbitrage. GDAX has been consistently higher than most exchanges because it has a shit ton of users so traders buy from other exchanges and sell on gdax when the spread between them get too high. One of the massive sell walls was eaten was it not?  I'm not saying spoofing doesn't happen on some of the exchanges but when some of those big walls are not moving that much and getting bought or sold I wouldn't call it spoofing. I think spoofing is when they move the walls in a short time frame or layer them then remove them.
Also when users buy or sell directly from coinbase and don't use the exchange they don't care about sell or buy walls. Obviously they wanted to sell and they knew it would get eaten at that price and time. It could be a trader that wants to exit a big position and that amount is actually pretty small to them. Maybe they have much more coin they plan to sell and are taking some money off the table.
Another thing to consider is that you will probably see the biggest walls on exchanges that are regulated and considered safer because that is where the big money is going to put their eggs. Why would they put all their coin on a exchange that they don't know anything about?

if you have 1 mbtc and try to send it I think it will all go to a fee.

Scarcity alone is not important and 21 million is not even that scarce. Only about 22 million 1963 Silver Ben Franklin Half Dollars exist yet you can get them pretty damn cheap (10 bucks). I'm sure many were lost in couches over the years and never found.
 I see bitcoin as a domain name with 21 million sub domains for sale. It could end up competing with another domain name with 100 million sub domains for sale or 64 million sub domains or even 2 million.

it's just a network. There are p2p networks and other networks without currency that run just fine and mitigate attacks. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:07:48
if half of the coins are in the hands of a few people and they just went from millionaires to billionaires overnight and if those few people decided to exit that would inflate the supply like never before.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:57:11
not everything is. Most exchanges have USDT and ETH pairs
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:18:11
I thought they said they plan on adding many coins? I don't think they updated that list in a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:59:59
core doesn't even use segwit addresses as default yet
but stay on that high horse you guys.

Would you rather own your own home or pay rent/make monthly payments to a bank for the rest your life is what he is saying. 
Nobody can predict with certainty what homes will cost 5 years from now just like nobody can predict with certainty how much crypto will be worth.
To me a home is the most valuable piece of the puzzle.

Not really. In the 90's not many had a PC and the ones that did used it for basic things like AOL and solitare. PC gaming was more of a niche.  It wasn't until Nvidia started cranking out 3d hardware on massive scale and the fact that PC's became cheaper causing sales to climb. PC gaming really took off around 2000.

True, but nobody bought up all the gamecubes ans stored them like gold. Everyone knew playstation and xbox was better.
AND this right around the sametime pc gaming took off.
bitcoin is pc gaming, xbox and playstation all rolled into one.

I wonder how many $1000+ value transactions happen a day on bitcoin vs lower amount transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:41:03
First they came for the coffee transactions, and I did not speak out
Because I was not a Coffee drinker
.Then they came for the gift card transactions, and I did not speak out
Because I was I did not use gift cards.
Then I sent all my money and went to a fee.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:24:29
I think a good portion of the current supply cost nothing.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:38:54
I did have you?
if you send to a smart contract (token) it costs extra (and still cheaper than bitcoin) but if you're sending to another normal eth address it's really fing cheap. like pennies cheap

I just read something saying eth is 
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:47:45
this is a great idea! coinbase should let users invest!
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:00:07


HAHA you really think poor people in Africa are going to group together and make one transaction a year with a 50 dollar fee? 
The little guy made bitcoin popular and worth what it is today. You make it so money can't move fast and cheap you can kiss it it good bye. The little guy, the everyday user will pick a cheaper alternative and the wealthy you speak of who are just a handful of people probably invested in this risky market of digital currency will be left holding the bag of nothing.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:58:52
not entirely true, eth has been doing about the same number of transactions as bitcoin since last month (around 200k) and is not having this 2 dollar plus fee problem. *plus they run smart contracts. bitcoin has one job.
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:40:25
now its theft through fees. And censorship by not being able to move small amounts around.
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:52:34
store for what? it's not money if you can't move it. might as well buy a brooklyn bridge that is for sale and store it away. If you want to make bitcoin unpopular that is the way to do it it I guess.
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:33:00
yep it priced out a very large user base who don't need to send 100's of dollars around using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:14:53
add more coins and assets! 3 is not enough!

I don't think SegWit lowers fees does it? I thought that was lightning network.
