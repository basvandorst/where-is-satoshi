Buy $100 per week for 20 weeks (5 months), preferably every Saturday or sunday as that when more likely dips happen.
Then forget the money for next 4 years, at-least for a halving period.

(Your) Money in the bank is banks money not yours fundamentally.
In India if a bank goes "bankrupt" then the max liability of the bank is $1300 or Rs. 100,000 per individual.
So if you hold more than $1300 in your account, all that money technically belongs to the bank to play around with and lose it, which they are very good at.
So both fundamentally and technically you are the loser.
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:13:52
Agreed. Shock is not for u or me who are aware and prepared. there are huge mass people who are not aware and who will FOMO buy once supply is squeezed.

They pumped from 7300 to 10500, then dumped it back to 9300. so a net of $2000 as profit booking for them.
The market will be real bullish only if BTC crosses 10600.
So if they pumped $2-3B they must have made $500M

Halving is a big incident which reduces supply by 50% from previous 4-year supply. All markets are only based on demand and supply dynamics. Supply shock in bitcoin in the past 2 halvings have lead to parabolic movements(this doesnt lead to adoption but FOMO buying). The in between periods on price movement are very crucial as they directly impact adoption.

Bro we are all in the crypto community and I totally get your point . ��
@_date: 2019-10-21 07:56:43
Its so awesome that every 10 minutes BITCOIN gets a new block which makes it ever more stronger and secure. It doesn't need any permission or instruction from anyone. 
MOST IMPORTANTLY, We will have 3 halvings in 8-1/2 years from today. Basically we will have almost \~ 99% BITCOIN supply ever available to the world and by the end of 5th halving (2028) we shall be really close to Global Adoption.
In the next 5-10 years I can see cryptocurrency being a part of our regular lives the same way current technologies like the internet and mobile communications are.
**Everything will be fast**
You want to send money back home to your parents who lives on the other side of the world? No problem, you just sent her $1,000 and it only took less than 10 seconds and cost you a cent to do so.
Your business partner in Dubai who is helping you start a hotel franchise needs the franchise fee and he needs it ASAP. No problem, thanks to crypto you just had $150,000 sent from your business account into your partners business account and for less than $10.
You didn’t even have to wait 3 days.
Since money is not the only thing that can be sent over the blockchain, we can expect “download” or file transfer times to be reduced to only a few minutes or seconds. Blockchain based copies of games, music, videos or books will be sent to your “wallet” at speeds that would make todays file transfer services look primitive.
We can already download 1GB files in less than 10 minutes using services like Mega, now imagine a network of blockchains that allow near instant data transfers. People will be paying for games and playing them within minutes.
**Everyone will use cryptocurrencies, whether they are aware of it or not as they will become PAYMENT SYSTEM.**
Money transfer is not the use that cryptocurrencies have, they are also used as transaction fees and to pay for services like smart contracts. In the future, businesses will use blockchains like Ethereum and Stellar to deploy self-executing smart contracts across their organizations.
Smart contracts are simply automated contracts which execute once certain conditions are met, for example, when you contribute money in an ICO, it is the smart contract and not the founders that credits you with the new tokens.
As smart contract technology improves, we can expect to see businesses removing the middle men from various processes which then reduces costs and makes their services cheaper for the end user.
All of this will happen in the background without consumers even being aware.
**Banks will accept and integrate cryptocurrencies**
Survival of the fittest actually applies to being able to adapt to a changing environment.
Banks will eventually accept cryptocurrencies and even create whole packages around them.
· People will open crypto bank accounts.
· You will be able to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from standard ATMs’.
· Crypto debit cards will become a normal thing
· Cryptocurrency loans and maybe even crypto currency credit cards will be issued to suitable candidates.
**Final thoughts**
We haven’t even scratched the surface of what cryptocurrencies are capable of, all the things mentioned in this answer are a fraction of the things cryptocurrency will be used for.
Fun fact: GPS technology and the internet where created by the military and their uses were very limited at the time but now we have companies like Uber.
That’s some food for thought.

10.7K is the level to break for a clean upside to 14K.
I think 6-12 weeks are good enough for a gradual movement to achieve above numbers.
New ATH target 20.1K is 4-6 months from today.

Guys just remember:-
1. This is a flash sale 40% discount.
2. During dump or pump, Qty of USD that corresponds against BTC held by you goes up and down.
3. Qty of BTC (sats) is always the same till the time you buy or sell.
4. 200 MA(for traders) is the most important indicator, please follow that. Price target \~ $7500 as per 200 MA.
5. HODLING (for long term investors/non traders) is the best option
6. Weak hands are quitting in panic
7. Smart hands are buying.
8. Patience is virtue.

Firstly sorry for your loss.
Secondly its really naive(you can be pardoned for your age) to invest so high amount of your portfolio into btc (being in indonesia)and further putting all of that into a single mining company which obviously is scam.
Its amazing what greed does to our brain. :()
I have gotten scammed by ponzi, mining schemes and even through phishing but i never put all my eggs into one basket. Basically thats the price you pay to learn the crypto business which i realised finally. Believe me there is nobody on this earth who wouldnt have lost money through scam or accident or ignorance into crypto since this is so early a market.
Now going forward, always have the private keys (do your research)with you if you want to hold any cryptos.
If your dont have private keys, Spread the investments into small amounts ($ 20-100) in case you are using exchanges or 3rd party wallets.
Be prepared to be scammed again as those scammers are somehow always a step ahead...till you become more wise.
Age is by your side.
Good luck

I think he is referring to governments in general primarily people who are in power. Given a choice no powerful organisation will let go of their power to control the others, issue is choice is very less with these powerful organizations with crypto and they are divided in their opinios. just to give an example, The RBI(Indian Financial Controller) has been hellbent on banning bitcoin for last 2 years, but not able to find consensus within the system. Same goes with Chinese and US as well i guess.
@_date: 2019-09-17 07:40:51
