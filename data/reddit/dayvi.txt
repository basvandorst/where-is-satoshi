I feel like one of the benefits of Bitcoin is to escape PayPal :(

I think Yog towers was paid for by YouTube. 
1m views on a youtube video = £1,000. They get an average of ~600,000 views per video = £600 per vid. 2 videos a day = £1,200 x 30 days = £36,000 a month. 
(that's just Lewis channel)
No where near a hospital consultant's wage, but it's alright for a small business.

A very popular phrase surrounding digital currencies is "to the Moon!"
Bitcoin has already been on the Moon twice, but still says it. He's been thinking of switching to "Mars."
Dogecoin is trying to reach the Moon too. He might be going the wrong way, but his spirit is strong.

I like Doge =)
Please don't take the comic the wrong way. I felt it was accurate and humorous. 
I've really tried to design the character  like the community is: happy and high spirited.

Never listen to the voices in your house. Those voices are only for long walks on the beach.

Was trying to be polite about the tip not working :P

Maybe the next comic:
Dogecoin: "Grandad Bitcoin, when will Dad be back from the hospital?"
Bitcoin: "Litecoin will be home soon. He's still recovering from his NC."

Recently a lot of people said  looked crap, so I've made my own version (as a bit of a piss take) 
It's the Magic Internet Money Wizard re-drawn.

What do you think of my redesign:

Anyone notice this is £75 (~$117) for those of us in the UK!

Chargebacks are more difficult in the UK.
