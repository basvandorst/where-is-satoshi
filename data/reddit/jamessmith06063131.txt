There are 10 % of smart traders who understand this bullshit and encourage others to hodl/buy the dip. And there are 90% of retards who believe in this shit and throw their real money at those 10%. And probably 10% is even exaggerated. Anyways, keep hodling hodtards! Yes you will make the global financial order collpase and roll to the moon in your lambo lol

Dude, people who hold Bitcoin don't give a flying fuck about it being used as a currency as it was originally designed. They just want to get rich quick by participating in this self sustaining ponzi bubble and that's why they encourage everyone to Hodl in hope to find greater fools who will buy BTC for a higher price than they did.

Some people here really believe that the "media attention is just starting"? Are you crazy or what? Literally everyone on the planet heard about bitcoin. And those who bought some, they also made their families and their pets purchase bitcoin. At this point no new people will be buying and the media attention has reached its peak and it's passed. Good luck "hodlers"

Dude people in this subreddit are either retards or they are actively invested in pro-bitcoin bullshitting. You're right in everything you say. Bitcoin is not Digital Gold. Nor is it a currency. It's an early tech that became obsolete and that generated a self sustained pyramid scheme bubble that's popping as I'm writing this.

You just gave investment advice. You probably don't know it, but if someone follows it, then it crashes, you can be held responsible by justice. Read the legislation
