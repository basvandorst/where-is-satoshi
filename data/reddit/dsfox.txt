I don't understand how converting to LTC helps here.  What am I missing?

This is not volatility 101, its advanced graduate level volatility.

I can’t think of a reason to do this.

I don't understand how the conversion to Litecoin helps avoid fees in the transfer from one exchange to the other.

My understanding of history is that its so big you're likely to find whatever you're looking for.

Scary times just like the last 250 years.

It doesn't matter what the dollar buys, it matters what the typical salary buys.

Either will kill you depending on the voltage other conditions.  Obviously a 12VDC charging wire isn't as dangerous as the 240VAC feed into your house, but that's not a fair comparison.

You're both wrong.   Except one of you is not claiming to know, just quoting Edison.

Basing your economy on treasure is not a good system in the long run.

Kind of a lousy job on the y axis too.

Between 50 and 200 employees - not all that large I would say.

Hard to say, since nobody even knows what actually happened.

Thanks, person pretending to know the future!

Nay, always exactly the same number of buyers as sellers.

This is the fundamental challenge of investing.  You have to step outside yourself and invest when the "real" you thinks things will never come back.

Folks been saying that for a long time...

3% annual inflation?  That is extremely moderate, a very conservative investment portfolio would easily offset it.
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:09:52
My guess would be $0.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:58:27
So I don't understand why we don't have more inflation if we've been printing money for so long.
