I think it's more expensive using transferwise. It's 1% compared to free using circle. 
Also, using transferwise I first have to send them a wire transfer, which my bank account charges a $40 fee for. The other option is to login to my bank account through their website so that they can do an ACH, which I don't feel comfortable with due to security and liability issues. (The bank is not liable for issues that may occur related to logging in that way as per the bank's website.)

I pay my employee in the Philippines with bitcoin. She cashes it out to her local currency whenever she wants. She asked me to start paying her in bitcoin because she was losing too much in fees using other methods. (Initially I was using PayPal.)

Art, gold, stocks, bonds, private equity, real estate, etc. USD loses value to inflation (partly due to them printing as much as they want!) so it wouldn’t be a good investment aside from possibly a relatively small amount of liquid and “stable” reserves. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:47:41
So why are you giving a huge chunk of your money to something that you say is run inefficiently and is not spent on the right things? Because you are forced to with the threat of violence and being caged. So how in the same breath can you say that “it isn’t that bad”?
Even the rules that are enforced are often times contrary to what the people want.

Where do you draw the line? Forcefully stealing the fruits of someone’s labor due to a monopoly on violence is theft regardless of whether it is 1% or 50%. That is not “freedom”. Moreover, most governments don’t use the majority of the money they stole from you for improving the standard of living. A lot of it is used, despite taxpayer (slave) objection, on wars, etc.

Paying in bitcoins to purchase the stock could be possible (if T0 chooses to allow it), although it is not required by any means. A company could easily purchase the stock in dollars and T0 could still use the blockchain to keep track of stock ownership.

I am in the U.S. and I have an employee in the Philippines. She was complaining about the fees PayPal was charging her. Those fees are a lot of money for her. I now pay her every month in Bitcoin and there are no fees on her salary transfer. 
This is one of dozens of applications of Bitcoin.
Some of these possibilities are less likely than others, but they are all possibilities to be considered nonetheless: (very long term time frame)
- remittances industry $500 billion
- eCommerce $500 billion
- in-store CC replacement
- 6.5 billion unbanked people
- deflationary asset
- tax haven money $30 trillion
- micro transactions
- contracts, escrow, betting, loans
- wall street (trading assets)
- circumventing capital controls
- world reserve currency
- black market
- public payments
- crowdfunding
- prevent spam
- oil industry

I don't remember exactly but I think your system required me to upload a picture of my ID. The verification process was not simple and fast, and asked for extensive info that I don't want to give, so I did not and likely won't do it.
In contrast, the verification process at circle was extremely simple and they didn't ask for extensive information. If you don't improve your process, when they start connecting with Philippine bank accounts, I think you will begin to face fierce competition.

I use sendmoney.ph to pay an employee in the Philippines. That can be seen as a form of remittance. What doing this made me realize is that even if bitcoin grew to dominate the remittance market, you wouldn't see the price grow drastically because the bitcoin is just bought and sold almost immediately.
For the price to really increase we need a closed loop where people don't convert back to fiat. We need a lot of places where bitcoin can be spent. We need reduced volatility so people don't feel like they are "investing". Most people don't want to or like to invest.

No, there are no discounts. They don't receive cash back or points like a lot of US cards. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 15:03:34
It's important to see the pros and the cons both. 
Yea... Practically free for me to pay my employee in the Philippines. I buy with circle (free) and send it to her using coins.ph (sendmoney.ph). Coins.ph instantly converts to local currency and deposits it in her bank account. They don't charge any fee but I think they probably make a little off of the sell trade (bitcoin to PHP). Overall seems a lot cheaper than PayPal. The only issues I have with it:
1. Many steps to complete the whole transfer on two different sites.
2. Circle.com only gives you $500 immediately. The rest can be exposed to volatility while you wait. A fully verified coinbase account can overcome this by giving you instant access to much more bitcoin, but I don't want to verify with them and they also charge fees where circle is free. 
3. Coins.ph has a sell/sending limit of 2 bitcoin per day unless you go through some verifications. I think you have to send a pic of an ID or something. I haven't done it and don't want to.
Overall all of it is a huge step in the right direction due to great companies like circle and coins.ph. I think it can and will get a whole lot easier soon. For example, when circle allows you to withdraw to a Philippines bank account and increases their instant access limit of $500. Then you could do circle to circle transfers to employees in the Philippines in one step, instantly, without any fees. - solving all my above headaches.

That's just considering the percentages of people that think it will be approved or disapproved. So it would be the probable immediate impact, but if it's approved and if there is enough demand for the ETF to exhaust the reserves that the ETF has, then in the months following the approval the price could run up even higher due to buy pressure from the ETF.

@_date: 2017-02-28 10:58:00
$500 is pretty much the base after the halving. This whole run up since then was mainly caused by ETF speculation and maybe slightly due to some new prospective layer 2 and scaling options that might solve some problems, not much positive aside from that has happened. Most of it is due to the ETF. Even if this isn't approved, there is still a chance for the other two ETFs, so I think people won't completely lose hope of the ETF, but I think people are waiting on the decision of the ETF to buy or sell. If it's approved, it's going up big time and fast. If it's denied or winklevoss are asked to withdraw for now, then I'd guess we're going down to $700 or $800 range. I don't think as low as $500 or $600 because a lot of new people have come in during this big run up.
What's the reason to be surprised about that? If the whole reason for this speculative bull run turns out to not happen, the vast majority of those speculators will bail when they see the price shooting down fast. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:51:55
Those fundamental qualities of bitcoin have and will always be there. I don't think people suddenly remembered those fundamentals and now the price has been increasing so much and so fast. I think it's speculation regarding the ETF.
We'll see. :)
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:55:46
Well, ideally it should give the same level of flexibility as holding the asset directly. You should be able to sell some coins from the old or new chain whenever you want, and fluctuations in the new coin shouldn't affect the original coin you signed up for in the ETF. I think an "ETF split" or dividend sound like better options. Then the original ETF doesn't morph into something else and the investor can go and buy the other coin with their dividend money if they wish. Or if an "ETF split" occurs, they can sell their position in that new ETF. I think the ETF split concept doesn't exist,  may be extremely difficult to set up due to no regulatory framework, and the Winklevoss may not even want to take on the burden of another ETF. So really that just leaves a dividend as the best option. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 07:56:32
I think way more than 15% of the Bitcoin community expects it to be approved. Maybe up to 40 or 50%. Somewhere in that range is probably priced in.
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:14:26
I agree that as long as the risks are disclosed to investors, they should be free to choose how to invest their money. That's normally how the SEC goes about it, albeit extremely slow. In the case of this ETF's proposal, it hasn't been made clear that the investor would lose the value in the forked chain. It just explains what the ETF would do in the case of a hard fork. To a person who isn't familiar with hard forks and the benefits of investing directly in bitcoin, from the details provided in the proposal, they would not be aware that investing in the ETF would cause lost value in the case of a hard fork as opposed to if they would have directly invested in bitcoin. Therefore, I don't think that risk has been conveyed to the investor. For that reason, if they don't fix this before the deadline, I think the SEC has a valid reason to reject it.
I personally think that a dividend in this case would make the most sense. (See my other comment above.) Even if they decide to deal with a hard fork the way they have outlined, that's their decision, but the drawbacks of that should be outlined to the investor. So far, those drawbacks have not been outlined.

Bitcoin is push, not pull. If you don't take security seriously, someone can access your bitcoin wallet. That's different. Similar to someone access your physical wallet if you don't take it's security seriously. However, no one can ever pull from your bitcoin wallet without your permission. It is a push protocol. Credit cards are pull.

There are 10 million shares initially offered at about $10 per share to match the current price of Bitcoin. So am I correct in assuming that only about $100 million of new money could move into Bitcoin? 
Am I missing something here? How could this ETF increase the market cap of Bitcoin by say $1 billion?
@_date: 2017-02-20 07:21:17
They want to get the news first, or as fast as possible, to trade based on it. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:22:07
What else is influencing it? I think you'd be hard pressed to name even one other thing that could be moving the price this much this fast. It's gone from $600 range to $1200. Massive. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:32:12
Yea I mentioned 40 to 50% of the Bitcoin community specifically. Most of the Bitcoin community follows social media and the news regularly because this industry moves so fast. 
I don't think it's a matter of pumping. I think the SEC going back and forth with Winklevoss and all the people involved in this ETF for 3 years is to understand and get everything in the prospectus clarified so any risks are outlined clearly to investors. The SEC has shown clear will to work with them and get to a point of approval. Now you even see meetings and revisions taking place *a lot* faster due to the deadline. Big money has been spent not just by the Winklevoss, but by all other players involved as well (like the exchange). The SEC could have just said no after hearing the public's concerns. They didn't. They continued to outline those risks in the prospectus. Their job is to outline risks and ensure that the investor is informed and has access to the necessary information. That's what they've been doing. That's near a completion point. 
It's all highly positive. If I was forced now to choose yes or no, I think they would say yes. I think a lot of other people think that as well, and that's why you see the price moving.

That might be the way you invest in ETFs, however, the SEC's job is to make sure *every* risk of an investment is outlined in detail so that the investor can make an informed decision.
They can decide to leave the management to the ETF custodian. According to the SEC, if just needs to be an informed decision, and that means outlining all the risks in detail. This risk of losing the value you have in the split chain is not disclosed in the ETF proposal. The SEC may see that as a problem. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 07:37:23
Well they have been making them wait for 4 years. If the SEC was interested in approving it, it would have happened a lot faster. Now when they're reaching a deadline, it won't be reason to approve. It seems unlikely. Although I'm hopeful!
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:32:09
Yes. You should hold bitcoin directly if you know how. You will retain value in both chains if there is a hard fork and you also don't have to hold faith that the ETF won't get hacked somehow.

Not to mention perks offered by almost all middlemen, which are unavailable with Bitcoin. People love their perks. For example, interest, points, cash back on purchases, etc. Middlemen have plenty of things they can offer on top of a p2p system to stay relevant and profitable.
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:36:49
A single satoshi can represent anything and then that can be traded back and forth. So this math is not accurate. For example, you could have one satoshi represent a gold brick in an asset exchange and then trade that back and forth. I suspect the "10% of GDP" estimate includes this type of thing. This would cause the price of Bitcoin to vary greatly from your math. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:48:40
The discussion is about whether middlemen will go out of business or not. Saying that most people don't think very much doesn't add to that discussion one way or another. "Most people" is what will decide whether or not middlemen go out of business based on the choice they make of what to use, so it is irrelevant how much they think. It is only relevant what they want and choose. That will decide the fate of those middlemen. I think it's perfectly reasonable for people to want all those benefits I've listed.

I'm all for bitcoin taking over the world, but I think the view you've described here is of a lot of people in this sub and not so much the general view of the public. Most people like to have a middle man to provide consumer protection. They don't like not having the ability to call customer support or do a chargeback. 
I think direct payments will grow enormously and middlemen like Paypal will decline in popularity, but I think there will always be some uses for a middleman  like Paypal to provide some added services on top. For example, even recurring payments.

Yea I use the same rule of thumb for investing in ICOs. Specifically, there must at least be an alpha released. 
Although I can understand people investing in just a whitepaper as well. It's akin to seed funding. It all depends on your appetite for risk or if you really believe in a project so much that you want to help it get off the ground without caring about a return. (Like kickstarter)
I think the key is balancing how much you invest proportional to the level of risk and understanding that in any event it's very high risk and you may lose everything, or you may get a ridiculously high return like some of these ICOs have. It's very binary.

Nailed it. People get hung up on "what do you mean there is no company that controls it? There has to be.", "who sets the price?", "what if someone hacks the code? There has to be some way to hack it.", etc. There are so many fundamentally different concepts within Bitcoin that embracing it is a matter of also embracing all of those wildly different concepts. Those concepts are very difficult to embrace without understanding the technicalities of what make them secure, viable, tried &amp; tested, etc.

The article fails to mention that this vulnerability is *caused* by Jaxx not even allowing you to encrypt with a password! All you can use is a 4 digit pin, which obviously is not secure. They somehow think making something secure takes away user-friendliness. People are used to passwords for bank accounts, why not a password for their crypto money? I think insecurely storing their coins on their device without the average user even knowing that it is insecure with a pin is what is not user-friendly!
