No not at all. There's nothing illegal about a bank accounts but if someone were for malicious reason to insert it along with SS and other personal information into the Blockchain that could be a serious issue.  It's something  I've been considering for quite some time and I've as of yet heard anyone present a case against it that wasn't just hyperbole. I just think that the potential for abuse of bad actor a is a real threat to the protocol. Without some sort of safeguards in place to mitigate malicious information being put into the Blockchain. At this point I think it's a moot issue but I can foresee a moment in the future that this could be held against us. 
I just want Bitcoin to succeed and to ignore the things like this IMHO is not thinking things through.

I swear this isn't a troll to beg for for money. I'd just like at the very least would like to get the BTC promised to me for signing up, that wasn't in the disclaimer for signing up, for a Blockchain.info wallet for a promised (I'm certain minimal BTC). What they didn't mention is you have to have 50 Twitter followers to receive the BTC. Don't believe me sign up your self and even look at their TOS. Even if you just follow me  and then unfollow after I receive the funds that they promised me is fine with me. I just want to to get involved and what's owned. You can Pm to make sure I'm not full of shit (I have screenshot as proof of their misleading advertising). Even one Satoshi would be cool just to see it's working. Thanks again and I fully realize you have no reason to believe me. Thanks anyway. Cheers! My Public Key is 1LHVPrbgDJujzeFTTLwAgaxQg7HJiu8XX3 I'm not looking for a handout just what's due to me based on their misleading advertising.

@_date: 2014-06-11 17:43:26
If you look at the signup screenshots I took you'll notice that you receive a small amount added to your wallet for posting a tweet for signing up.

decentralization of the network depends on it. unless you want only large scale operations that can wait it out till the market price makes it a feasible profit model. this is a serious issue. i've run the numbers quite hard as i'm considering getting into mining using solar and it's a huge risk. i believe in the future of btc but only if significant decentralization can be maintained.

I'm not the best coder in the world but it seems to me there ought to be some way to cross check them in a decentralized fashion since they were preinstalled. Setup some sort of talk back from the machine sending micro-payments automatically to the non-profit to verify those machines. If this is ludicrous feel free to pick it a part.

@_date: 2014-06-08 17:05:36
Well the way bitcoin works it goes to longest string. I was just wondering if there'd be a way that if  network keeps seeing the same node winning more that 3x it could look at other nodes to make sure it's valid. If the transaction is then valid the reward goes to the person who first one. granted I'm not the smartest person on this subject just hoping someone who is can tear my idea apart or inspire an idea along these lines.

I seem to be the only one that keeps bringing this up but for people to continue running mining operation profitably the valuation has to reach into the $2k plus range. If it doesn't one of 2 options will probably happen the network collapses or the big mining operations (i.e. bank loans) that can run at a loss until it becomes profitable centralize the network.  
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:08:07
DDOS is the modern day equivalent of a sit in. period. it's complete bullshit that anyone considers it cyber-terrorism. what ghash/cex is doing should be considered cyber-terrorism if law was caught up with bitcoin. imagine someone trying to take control of the FED's money printing machine and what it'd do to the value of the dollar. that's the equivalent of what they're doing.

Biggest elephant no seems to be talking about is with difficulty spiraling so fast, by my estimates, BTC has to hit $2500 by next year or the mining community will be running at a net loss without significant fees worse that CC's. biggest factor in modeling the price is whether companies start seeing Bitcoin as store of value like gold instead of just a 'fee-less' transaction method. Play with this modeling widget I saw on here awhile back.

thanks great response! i'm just thinking in worst case scenarios of course. shrem's case wouldn't be a case though if it was at a network level. i'm picturing a scenario in my head that btc has the potential with these onerous laws that it becomes the naptser of coins and ends with pirate bay browser and torrents (figuratively speaking of course). 
i posted this elsewhere i'd be curious hear what you have to say:
if they can manage a slowdown it's use as store of value (which i believe is the central goal of the regulation). if they accomplish this then they can make it so only large scale mining facilities with large cash reserves can hold on running at a loss till consumer adoption and store of value are high. at that point decentralization plummets and only the rich miners (bank own or large gov approved corp) can profit. maybe i'm just in a conspiratorial mood but i can see this as an motive and an outcome.

run the analysis out a year from now with the most efficient rate of .37w/gh scaling at difficulty increase of marginal 20% per month and see where that gets you at the current valuation. you'll be in the negative i've done a significant analysis of the problem and it doesn't bode well for the network without a price over $2k in a year.

We'll I'd wouldn't want it to be centralized in the sense that it would all be going to our servers.

This is why it'll be very important for us as a community to make sure all candidates in 2016 accept Bitcoin donations. Once they're sucking on the tit of Bitcoin it will be much harder for them to come out against it.

i'm not sure why you feel the need to be such a dick. if you want people to use these machines than you need to take a different tone when answering questions. 
when i withdraw my funds that i purchased from coinbase where i have a account and want to withdraw those funds i'm laundering money?

i'm uncertain of the parameters of your inquiry.

'You must use the Bid Form that will be provided to eligible registered bidders only. Your bid must reflect the number of Series A Blocks (up to a maximum of 9 blocks) and Series B Blocks (up to a maximum of 1 block) that you wish to purchase. A bid on more than one block from the Series A Blocks means that the bidder will accept any number of blocks up to the number of blocks for which he/she/it bid (e.g. a bid to purchase 5 blocks of Series A means that bidder will accept 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 Series A Blocks at the per block offer price).' Doesn't seem to preclude one person being able to bid on all the blocks or am I reading this incorrectly?

Oh, I haven't bought any miners. I'm more interested in the network effect and debt load the miners are incurring to pay bills. I can see an outcome where miners default on loans and the various banks end up owning most or all of the network. I've postulated on this idea before and I don't want to come across as conspiracy theory quack. I'm, just trying to stay ahead any perceived threats to my investments.

What are you mining with  and what is you kwh rate? If you don't mind me asking.

I wasn't starting to think everyone was missing the obvious answer why 'sheeple' will care. When people with BTC are rich and they're poor, people will get it you can bank on that(yes bad pun intended).

Does the author want to be hacked because this how you ask to be hacked. Not that I have such skills. I'm guessing though pissing of the most talented coders in existence money isn't going  to end well.
