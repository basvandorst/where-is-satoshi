I don't quite get how the futures affect the price of BTC.  It should be the other way round.
The only effect should be if the futures prices indicate the futures market had strong thoughts that the price of BTC would go up/down, in which case all the twitchy BTC owners would suddenly ask "what do they know that we don't", and proceed to make it self-fulfilling.

Although it will be a big plummet, I don't think it will go that fast.  Expect quite a few pick-ups on the way down.  There are plenty of people who mistake this for a dip.
Almost everyone buying during the last week has been told and assumed that the price only ever goes up, or if it drops a bit then it always comes back straight away.
All that was needed was 1 day to prove their assumption wrong, their basic rationality will return, and they'll be gone as quickly as they arrived.
Half the HODLers are actually quite sensible, and will of course sell too.

The price at which they got liquidated was exceeded only very temporarily and then came back down.  Must be gutted.  But with $2M, they knew the rules.

I've been watching GDAX for 8 months.  EUR trades on average at a 1% to 1.75% premium, as compared to USD converted at the mid-market FX rate (use xe.com).  Recently, it has had some periods when it has been 3% to 5% premium, and the last couple of days have been mad - 7%, 9%, now 12%.  Having said that, there have also been times where EUR has been at a discount.  Time of day isn't necessarily a factor.  The kind of people buying like crazy at the moment are up at all hours!
The GDAX EUR market is fine as long as you are cautious about the possibility of the premium.  What choice do you have?  Will they let you use USD?  USD trading is not available on GDAX here in UK.  BTC/GBP is a lot less liquid, and almost entirely populated by annoying bots constantly trying to get 0.01 ahead of you.

Yes - there seems to be a problem with the matching engine right now.  I had an order that I suspect was partially filled, but the BTC have not been credited and the fiat is deducted and on hold.  When reloading the screen, the order keeps coming back despite trying to cancel it.  Nothing appears in the fills section, and I cannot sell.

Don't say I didn't warn y'all.  Obviously my previous post about this went unnoticed because it didn't conform with the prevailing, err, wisdom.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:49
It's not currency converting either.
It's because people buying in EUR were, at that time, buying more frantically than those buying in USD.  The BTC/EUR and BTC/USD markets are separate, and have their own supply/demand dynamics.
I sat and watched the EUR market come to its senses just before noon, when the market realised it become over-exuberant compared to the "real" USD price.  I thought at the time that it would be painful for some.

Presumably that I need to have a reddit account to have a valid opinion.  Err, who's the one looking stupid here?

It's time-consuming to move either BTC or fiat money between exchanges, and there's a real risk by the time it gets there the price has moved.  So, to arbitrage as you describe, you need to maintain both fiat and BTC on any exchange where such a difference may arise (and there are many of them).  Even then, if the price differential is always in the same direciton, you'll still find yourself having to shuffle fiat and BTC between exchanges to rebalance.

Bulgarian won't do so, but the many fools who refuse to see that this is a bubble will blame the crash (sorry, "correction") on anyone or anything, so expect them to point the finger at Bulgaria anyway.  Or is it Wall Street?  Hang on, a few days ago Wall Street were good for bitcoin ...
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:38:21
Errr ... and have you wondered how much money needs to be deposited with the exchanges in order for them to let people buy at those prices?  And if so, how that could actually happen?
Total absence of coherent thought, but what do I expect coming on here!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:10:51
They are the same company.  GDAX is the "serious" exchange, Coinbase is a more retail-focused front-end, if you see what I mean.  Purchases through Coinbase get executed on GDAX.
It's easier to get money onto their system via a purchase on Coinbase (they take cards).  You pay a sizeable fee to get the money there initially (allow for a 5% loss).  Then you can transfer funds of any kind (crypto or fiat) to/from GDAX freely.  Once funds are there, trade through GDAX because it is much cheaper.  You can usually trade for free using limit orders.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:24:22
(a).  Today.
For (b) to happen sustainably, the amount of money that would have to be deposited with exchanges would be unfathomably large.  They don't let you buy bitcoin without having your fiat money first!  Imagine if every seller evaporated; then the price could become as high as you choose.  But the amount of BTC being bid for at that price would be minimal and you wouldn't be able to sell any significant quantity at that price.  But something like that would get McAfee off the hook.

It wouldn't be the first time someone had talked crap about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:40:22
If you question how 1 BTC can be worth $15K, then I suggest you do not buy.  This bubble is precisely because of people abandoning reason and being swayed by the herd mentality.  "Everyone is doing it, so it must be right!" ... I think not.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:58:04
I'm reluctant to speculate on how low it could go, but personally I would say 70% off is still way too high a price.  The ONLY reason it is so high is because 99.9% of current buyers believe they are guaranteed a quick and substantial profit.  When the chart turns downwards for any significant length of time, that belief will evaporate and so will the supply of buyers.  And it will take more than a year for the lessons to be forgotten.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:13:38
Your decision to hodl has virtually zero effect on what happens to the price.  And it's not Wall Street, it's some grandma in Korea.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:49:30
None of that will ever happen.  It's just going to drop back down to a more sensible price and be an interesting curiosity again.
The practical reality of it reaching $1m-plus is impossible.  (a) A sizeable percentage of all the world's currency would have to be in Coinbase's bank account.  (b) Most of the buying is/was being done by newbies on credit cards - the CC companies would call a stop to it because they'd be owed so much money (they give every customer a credit limit, but they can't handle everyone maxing out all at the same time).

Attractive to the holder of BTC, but deeply unattractive to the organisations that run the futures.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:37:13
Yes, I did!  It is my belief that bitcoin is at imminent risk of a crash. Plenty of people create accounts on here to express their belief that it will grow for ever.  Nobody condescends to them.
The collective insanity will end very soon, and you won't have a chance to get out.  Look at the selling today and GDAX locking up.  And there wasn't even any news.  First piece of remotely bad news = Game Over.
We'll talk again next week when the dust settles.

Whatever your opinion of the concept of government, it is almost always true that countries are run by intelligent people!  Like them or hate them, they are rarely fools.
Bulgaria may sell some of this stash, but they are not going to dump it in one go on GDAX.  Like most other people, they would do it over time.  As individuals, you and I know that dumping it quickly would crash the price, and I assure you that the Bulgarian government will know this too.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:51:50
To quote one of *many* examples: 10 minutes ago on GDAX: $15,898 to $15,200 in 1 minute.
Yes, the general trajectory is up, and all such drops have been recovered so far.  But none of them so far have been triggered by any actual negative news.  I'm just saying, put yourself in the mind of a typical buyer at the moment.  Most people are fundamentally rational, caught up in collective irrationality.  A relatively minor jolt will knock them to their senses, and the minor jolt will suddenly escalate.  Down will be faster than up, I promise you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:31:41
Most ordinary people would, if they saw the price drop by $1K soon after they bought it.  You can see the fear in the markets.  A little knock leads to a wave of selling.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:16:16
But not so great for the millions of new buyers sucked in by all the hype, who were assured the price could only ever go up up up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:51:48
Yep. I'm regularly turning GBP into EUR and back again for a virtually risk free profit as the relative premiums change.  I don't fancy BTC for more than a couple of seconds at the current prices, but each to his own!

Reddit is designed so popular posts are prominent.  This forum is populated overwhelmingly by bitcoin converts.  Any remotely pessimistic post is downvoted into oblivion and never sees the light of day after spending a couple of minutes on the "new" page.

Yes, the consensus is that "we don't really have any clue, so we'll have a guess close to the current price and at least we won't lose any worse than we would by buying actual BTC".

On GDAX/Coinbase this morning, BTC was exchanging for Euro at a ridiculous premium compared to the dollar price.  It was at a 9%-plus premium for a long time, and as much as 12% at one point.  The Euro price was above EUR14,600 for about 50% of the time between 10am and 12 noon.
The premium has reduced now (although it is still much higher than average), so the Euro price is lower even though the USD price has gone up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:09:16
If they're prepared to pay a 34%-plus premium for using a currency other than the primary exchange currency for BTC, then let them.  They're crazy, and someone will gladly take their money by arbing against their exchanges until they realise it and start being more sensible.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:37:51
The price on Bitfinex has been rising during the GDAX problem.  There's no sign of anything like that.  Probably GDAX just need to reboot.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:36:09
You misunderstand the current horde of buyers.  These are not investors.  They are gamblers, although at the moment they believe they cannot lose.  When they see their "investment" drop a bit, they will realise it is not a guaranteed win and they will sell what remains.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:14:42
I watched the rise, trade by trade, the other day when it went over $19K on GDAX.  It was the absolute illustration of a delusional mania -- you don't get the feeling from a chart after the event.
That day, whenever there was a slight rise in price, it got madder and madder.  You could almost hear the herd in a wild panic, manically pressing the BUY button in case they missed out on the last chance before it shot up to a million dollars.
The next day the price dropped and people finally got the idea that it doesn't just go up up up.  Some of their rationality will have returned.
Now we are in the bull trap.  Some people think it's "on sale" now, 5% or 10% off.  They will buy for a while, but it will be much weaker than on $19K-day.  It may look like the price will recover and carry on up.  But it will stall, and then there's nothing left to keep it up.

Loans.  Always pay off debt before saving, unless your savings are empty in which case save a bit.  I'm sure they would understand you wanting a little safety net.
If you won't receive the money for another 2 weeks, BTC will not seems so attractive by then anyway, seeing as how it will have crashed catastrophically and be in a long and deep decline, at least until the the next time mass irrationality sets in.
