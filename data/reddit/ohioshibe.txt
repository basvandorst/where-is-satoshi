Huh I was just looking at Akron yesterday trying to figure out where the best spot to put a bitcoin ATM would be....wacky!
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:53:11
check out bitcoin.tax.  It can figure out your cost basis for you.  In my case I had recurring weekly buys and the occasional spend and it took care of everything.

Well the thing with the 401k money is 1) it comes out before tax which is great and 2) there is a company match which is basically just free money for the taking (yeah I know I'm working for it but still).
And while I might seem like a super smart investor I guess - really I'm just lucky.  The money I put into bitcoin over the years was classified as 'hobby' money for me.  Basically a weekly buy that I treated like a purchase of lunch or dinner at a restaurant - just spent and gone.  For entertainment!
It is only in the past year that its become a really serious thing like, woah, thats actually a lot of money and I'd be sad to see it disappear.
I kept some and am buying back in over time again.  So really its remaining as my main investment (beyond the 401k!).

As long as you don't sell/trade/spend, I don't believe so (edit to add: I am not an accountant or involved in finance etc).  
There is an argument that you need to treat forked coins as income though ( - I was mostly concerned with getting everything squared away correctly with my sale of forked coins.

I just tried bitcoin.tax and it was amazing

Hey congrats to you - I know where you're coming from.  My spouse and I decided to partially cash out to pay off our mortgage last week (along with state and federal cap gains tax, shoutout to bitcoin.tax again!).
I've NEVER not had rent or mortgage.
Will be buying back in with extra money and I still have some left anyway.  We've also just maxed both our 401ks.  Looking forward to getting a new deck this spring - home improvements will be much less painful now :D

I just set up trezor last night and it was super easy. So relaxing to know that I and only I really control my coins

For some reason when I click the link to approve the withdrawal from my work email address I get "You have already performed this action".
Have tried all kinds of things to fix it and cancelled/created the withdrawal quite a few times now.  Even created a new coinbase account with my work email as the owner which was supposed to allow me to approve from within coinbase itself, but its not showing as being associated with my primary account like its supposed to be so I can't approve that way either.
Thursday I was told I should create a new vault and they'd move the coins to it and that's all I've heard since.  Coins haven't moved.
I even sent an email saying, "I would love to hear from someone there even if it is to only say 'we're working on it'." and nothing...which is why I'm all antsy.

I posted this already and I'm going to post it here again because before I did this I was looking for someone with specific links to metal and tools and couldn't find anything.
I have a hardware wallet and these price increases are making me nervous so I just bought:
[Number and Letter Stamp Set (36 PIECE PUNCH SET / A-Z &amp; 0-9) Industrial Grade Hardened Carbon Steel Metal - 1/8" (3mm) Characters - Perfect for Imprinting Metal, Wood, Plastic, Leather, &amp; More!](
[Online Metal Supply 304 Stainless Steel Sheet (26 ga.) .018" x 12" x 12" - 2B Finish] (
I've decided against a safe because as others have mentioned a safe just says 'Steal me please'.
I've decided against a safe deposit box at the bank because - well this is bitcoin and that just seems wrong.
Last weekend I successfully punched my backup seed onto the metal sheet and hid it on the moon (no of course not really on the moon, too many bitcoiners there).  
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:46:25
I would consider selling when I would have enough to pay both taxes on the sale and pay my house off.  It would be sorely tempting.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:35:42
Sell your plasma - buy bitcoin? How cool would that be to say you bought your millions with your own blood? 
(okay maybe not millions, but still!)
@_date: 2015-08-13 13:34:58
I used to use these guys all the time to buy doges, no problems at all and very fast service.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:55:39
I'm a fan of this chart 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:38:49
seems like a good idea for one, maybe try submitting it as a feature request to them?

I'm hoping the stainless steel sheet isn't too hard for the stamp set to mark.
Once I get my backup seed stamped on the stainless steel though - I have to find a good hiding spot.

[edit] links and stuffs
[edit2] also thinking of covering the stamped sheet in something like hard clay (have to break the clay to make the seed visible)

Trezor hardware wallet, backup seed stamped in stainless steel

cheers!  Its a good feeling :D

The best you can do is mine an alt coin and then trade for bitcoin - I've seen nicehash suggested.
Easiest thing to do though truthfully is just to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:11:55
aha, well good luck to you!
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:37:52
I believe Gocoin accepts dogecoin and litecoin ([edit] along with bitcoin).  Up to you if you think its worth your time of course!  Would be no fun for you to set it all up to have no one even use it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:23:08
I think these would be short term capital gains:
"Short-term capital gains do not benefit from any special tax rate – they are taxed at the same rate as your ordinary income. For 2017, ordinary tax rates range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, depending on your total taxable income."  - turbotax.com
But you would only pay gains on your profit right?  So as long as you aren't taking out more than you are putting in?
My suggestion - ask an actual accountant or two.

I've been buying pretty much weekly since 2015.  I sold enough to pay off my mortgage when we hit 17.5k.  
I'm still buying weekly! - every purchase under my sale price makes me happy.
Will be paying my taxes from the sale here in a week or two - whee.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:04:03
I have a trezor so I used their tool
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:07:57
Ditto - reported and paid big ass taxes. Everything is all downloaded and calculated and reportable.  Includes BCH and BTG sales when forks happened and random idiotic attempts at day trading (never again!)

Yep thats what I did!, got into mining Doges and then finally converted them to btc

Yep being super slow for me too.

I was amused - but wasn't trying to do anything serious on the exchange anyway.
