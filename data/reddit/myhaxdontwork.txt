Yeah, pretty comical. Just hoping for the best.

Thanks for the link and reply. My concern stems from, of course, the upcoming Futures trading. Only needing 154 BTC to drop kraken's price by 8% is quite concerning.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:02:19
Looks like you won.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:03:51
Fingers crossed. Brokerages like Interactive Brokers (not trying to plug the company) are only offering Long positions in the Futures market. Was happily surprised to hear such a stipulation. 
Appreciate the feedback and thoughts. Guess we'll find out shortly.

Any hodl-er with bitcoin in a coinbase account does not physically own their bitcoin. I'd need to send my coinbase bitcoin to my hardware wallet to literally 'own' my private keys. If every coinbase user performed this task with no intent to return their bitcoin to coinbase ever again, then coinbase as an exchange becomes meaningless. That was all I was trying to get across. Maybe it never happens, but I thought it was an interesting scenario.

Happens too quickly to snap the shot, but everytime they go through I have a "WTF" moment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:35:52
Wow. That's actually huge news. Pretty sick...
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:02:12
Congratulations! Send some my way ;)

Seeing as how Bitcoin is global, I don't put as much weight into the literal US Futures trading (prices). What I do care about is the risk of a well coordinated sell-off in actual BTC [to meet lower futures prices]. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:18:00
If true, that would be lovely! Can't stand the idea of people shorting BTC (aside from a squeeze), but I digress.

They also remove their sell orders on the way down and attempt to re-sell at a lower price. Not just the way up for more profit. My observation was... they arent actually selling anything at all. Just putting up the wall, and taking it down. And repeat.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:52:34
Haha, it's great when the blocks get bought up. Not so great when you clearly see games are being played and the price declines.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:50:56
Definitely not the entire drop; there are much larger issues/manipulation/legitimate sells going on to account for the drop in price. That said, the attempted and repeated large sell block orders do not help any price gains. Huge and quick buy orders are needed to knock this seller out. My guess is, with a disposable 100-500 BTC to sell, they have much more in the tank in reserve.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:16:51
I am curious of this as well. Seller's logic is what baffles me, unless they are attempting a larger, coordinated price manipulation. Not trying to cry conspiracy theory, but seller's actions make no damn sense to me. Only conclusion I can come to is they want the price lower to buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:06:05
I'd tend to agree with you if the walls were left up long enough to be triggered. The sell orders are taken down before a buyer can even get to them. To me, that's manipulation -- not price discovery.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:47:43
Feels so good.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:51:04
If true, those numbers are remarkable. And scary.

Big if, but if a country were to accept BTC for oil, it would be Iran.

Still getting used to reddit. Meant for the following text to accompany the graphic:
Very nice to see both currencies moving in sync, especially since BTC has recently stifled ETH's movement.
However what I find most interesting, are the volume levels over the past 2 days.
ETH's move to $345 did not need a relatively large push, all things considered. Perhaps because the chart was primed for a breakout.
Would love to see even more volume in BTC to create a new base above 5,000; and more ETH volume to establish a new base above 340.
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:59:27
Perhaps. Unfortunately no one has the answer as valuing crypto is entirely new. Not sure how I feel about volume on an annual basis, but something on a daily basis makes more sense. Either way, it's favorable for the price of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:03:40
I can go back and watch the segment again, but as I noted above, it's not actually a P/E ratio despite the title of the graphic. The whole reason they put this up, is because the action of valuing crypto is entirely new. The most digestible term for traditional stock market investors is "P/E". The 50X has to do with the number of daily transactions. Basically, the more transactions per day, the higher the stock price. 
Will edit my prior post but I think the value is calculated with the following:
(# of daily transactions divided by market cap) x 50.
If someone cares to do the math, you'll see we are currently "over-valued" but whatever.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:58:22
Wondering the same. Based on the article, I'm also wondering if it makes sense to move BTC into Electrum during both forks, and THEN move all coins to a hardware wallet. I may have misread, but did it not mention you would need to move them to a new wallet anyway? 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:05:27
Despite the title of the graphic, the TV segment was not using the typical price to earnings (p/e) ratio that you may know of. However, they were in fact stating it's "price ratio" is correlated to the number of transactions in a given day. I forget the specific numerator/denominator combination (should be # of daily transactions divided by current market cap -- or vice versa) but the screenshot is extremely misleading. Hope that helps.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:23:56
Articles be articles, and who the hell really knows. But good food for thought.
IMO, we're in a healthy upward channel with lots of money coming into the crypto space. Average down, or hold onto your butts.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:12:12
Thanks for putting this together. I am curious how often the price per BTC updates on the retailer's side. Would be interesting to have a payment go through right before/during/after a drastic price change 
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:52:27
BTC has continued to stay within the bands pretty well. 
Absent of unforeseen circumstances/news, I'd expect to see some consistent wave patterns in our future. Quick dip into the 4,000s isn't out of the question.
Quite the pretty chart, in my opinion.

The Chief of Staff has great authority and influence. Did you know that Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney were both Chief of Staff? Powerful people set direction, so I think this is an overall net positive (for Bitcoin).
