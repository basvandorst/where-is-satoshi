The protocol can be tweaked or modified to address any issues or shortcomings, all that's needed is the consensus of miners if I recall correctly.  Besides most altcoins out there have just taken the bitcoin open source code and added a few tweaks.  Bitcoin can do the same if an altcoin has some better feature.

Yup, paper wallets like Moral said.  I like this tutorial personally   Just print a single wallet, xfer your coins to the "share" green address and your set.  Coins can't be spent without the red "secret" half.  Make a couple of copies.  If you lose your paper wallet, the coins are gone forever.

@_date: 2013-11-15 18:44:27
I too was confused as FUCK about bitcoins and how it all works.  Personally, this tutorial worked for me - 
Go to bitaddress.org and generate a "single wallet".  Which generates an address that you attach to a wallet.  Don't worry about the The "paper wallet" tab, it's really just 3 single wallets.  Follow the tutorial I listed above.  The "share" in green is what other people scan in order to send you money.  The "secret" in red is what you scan when you want to spend money after you scan a vendors QR code.  That's the beauty of having a paper wallet.  No one can spend your bitcoins, not even you, without that red "secret" QR code.  So don't lose it, keep it private, and keep a few extra copies.  
Once I set up my online wallet with blockchain.info I went to  and found a guy to sit down with me and exchange bitcoins for cash, face to face.  You can try and setup an account with coinbase.com or bitstamp.net but it takes a few days to verify everything.  I was itching for some coins and localbitcoins found me someone in the area who was willing to take my cash and transfer his bitcoins to my wallet in blockchain.info.  Face to face sit down was perfect and I wasn't totally worried about fucking something up like sending coins to the wrong place or getting scammed.

@_date: 2013-11-29 13:40:18
Personally, I think MTGOX is probably one of the best exchanges to keep your bitcoins.  Even better than BTC China - the government in China could swoop in and take everything in an instant.  You're probably seeing lengthy withdrawal times because of the HUGE increase in interest with bitcoins.  
  
  That being said, I don't keep my btc on an exchange.  Not only is bankruptcy a concern, but so is hacking and possible US government tax intervention.  Paper wallet only for me.

I tried to do verification with mine and after entering all my info and it attempting it failed.  My credit union doesn't do online verifications.  That being said, I like coinbase and use them exclusively for selling and buying.  Once you get set up, be sure to make a purchase (even if only for $5.00) because you can not make subsequent purchases until that first one goes through.  I missed out on a prime buying opportunity because I bought $75 worth of bitcoins to hand out for Christmas and then the market tanked to ~$450 and I could not buy anymore until the first purchase processed, which took about a week.

Certainly he can afford to spend some of his bitcoins on the things he needs/wants which will only promote bitcoins legitimacy.  Even I only have 7ish bitcoins and have sold a fraction on gyft.

The benefit to the consumer in my opinion is privacy.  Now one could argue that cash gives you privacy, and it does, unless you're buying something off of the internet.  Now I want to be able to buy a backpack for my brother and a pressure cooker for my mother and not have to worry about the [ATF knocking on my door.](
Merchant adoption is critical right now.  Now when you start mixing money, math, and technology people give you that glazed over look, so bitcoins are a bit confusing to the average Joe vendor.  Once they research that they just need a wallet and an account on an exchange like bitstamp to xfer bitcoins to their bank accounts, walla.  Easier said than done, but as bitcoins become more popular in the news more vendors will jump onboard.  
  
  At the moment litecoin is the nearest competitor, but the fact that it's a few years behind bitcoin might as well be lightyears in this internet day and age.  As far as institutionally backed crypto currencies, well we already have credit cards for that and that's what drove bitcoin to be created.  People are tired of big, fat, greedy banks.  
  
  As long as there's a demand, there's real value. How long that will last is anyone's guess, but I'm with the Winklevoss twins in thinking this is the cusp of a new era of currency.  I don't think it will ever replace the dollar or gold, but it will be an alternative.

Complete noob here to the bitcoin world, so Moronic Monday fits perfectly for me.  I know you buy bitcoins online from someone that's mined them.  So I have 1 bitcoin valued at around $140.  I want to buy a widget that costs $70 - how is change derived,?  And how do I give the vendor half of my bitcoin?  Does the $70 in change ever go up in value as bitcoins have done over the past few weeks?
Thanks!

Plus bitcoins are trending up and so they'll give you a discount, knowing they'll recover it when btc's shoot to the moon.

BTC China introducing fees added a lot of fuel to the fire IMO...

It's rising, still quite fast when compared to other things.  It's just not going parabolic, which is actually good thing.  People won't see it as some get rich quick scheme.  And frankly I'm OK if the get-rich-quick people want to bail.
