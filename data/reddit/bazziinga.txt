Can you add in the Binance exchange. It doesn’t make sense to leave out the largest exchange. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:39:40
Hahaha. 
*starts silently crying
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:28:25
It’s really nice. I actually like the colour scheme. Seems very crypto! Can you add Odyssey (OCN) to the tracker? I just bought the app but I don’t see oCoin in there. The website is ocoin.sg in case you are interested in checking it out. 
Edit: you should look at expanding the decimal places for the coins. PAC, Dent, Kin for example show up as $0.0. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:51:47
Do your prices round up to the nearest 10th? TRON is at $0.06 but your app says $0.1
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:14:37
Nothing that fluctuates that much in price is a store of value. Also remember back when everyone said it was a currency? Lol. Now it’s a store of value and tomorrow it will be.... 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:18:58
Gotcha. Good point. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:54:43
Here is the wallet address of the stolen BTC in case you care
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:43:59
I’m amazed you can have that chart up while driving!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:46:50
A wallet saved to your computers hardrive and not accessed through a web browser 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:48:05
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:54
Yes you’re right but not according to the SEC
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:04:47
Yah or the hackers somehow located it... or it was an inside job. I honestly have no clue how they got the private key. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:04:21
No they do. The famous “tulip mania” in the 17th century. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:28:32
Think about it from a goods and services perspective. If you sell something that’s worth less than it was last year then you need to sell much more to remain in business because each unit brings in less revenue. If this continues year after year eventually you are selling something that is worthless. Governments offset this by printing more money each year. They devalue the currency more than the good is devalued so as to actually increase its value and spur the economy in the right direction. Of course if governments gets carried away you end with Germany in the 30’s or Venezuela now. Many also argued that Quantitative Easing would cause rapid deflation 
@_date: 2018-09-22 02:05:16
How do you make that on an iPhone?

Wouldn’t that mean they are American?

I think Gavin was part of the Satoshi team and wanted to deflect attention. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:53:49
Yup. And not one thinks that the recent surge is being driven by Wall Street investors and hedge funds pumping millions $$ into it, looking for a quick profit. They thinks it’s the faithful continuing to buy because they believe in Satoshi’s vision. The truth is BTC is just a security now, there’s no difference in the eyes of Wall Street between Bitcoin and any other stock. And let’s be honest, anyone can take the code, alter it and create an alt coin that does the exact same thing. It’s the equivalent of printing (digital) money. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 12:46:57
Wait.... does reddit likeTrump now? Ok fine! 
@_date: 2018-09-25 01:58:17
You realize that actual deflation in the economy is devastating right? Currency deflation helps spur inflation of goods and services
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:15:12
Lol. Nothing on the blockchain is untraceable. Every coin is accounted for. The identify of the person with the private key is the unknown factor. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:13:02
Shakepay as well. Easiest thing in the world. You just use your debit card. Funds are there within 1-2 hours and then you buy. That’s it. Why do people think it’s hard?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:43
Well consider 40% of all bitcoins are on 1000 addresses owned by a few hundred guys. And then consider they can all call one another to time their selling and buying and it’s perfectly legal. Why is it legal? It’s not because bitcoin is unregulated like most people think; it’s because it’s a currency and info sharing is legal when it comes to currency. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 18:57:27
Why’s it called that?
@_date: 2018-09-21 02:48:41
Upvoting because it’s true. The whales control the price or at least they could if they wanted to
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:08:09
Yah but many alts don’t compete at all with bitcoin. Take BABB for example. It’s a fin tech start up applying for a UK banking license. They will use the blockchain and a utility token to process transactions. That’s nothing like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 05:24:49
Forget the bread. What kind of economic theory is he subscribing to? Deflation is a bad thing!
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:21:52
I understand all that.  But imagine if bitcoin hadn’t of taken off. No one would mine it at these hash rates. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:04:43
Why did Satoshi make it increase at this rate? Seems crazy to me. Why not make things simple and easy 
Edit: love being downvoted for asking a simple question

@_date: 2018-08-30 17:05:52
Is the idea to use this in a store or to use the iPhone app and leave the card at home?
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:51:05
On a serious note is bitcoin trademarked or copywrited in any way? I can just see big corporations taking advantage of this
@_date: 2018-05-26 02:12:53
Awesome because BABB (BAX) was just invited by their Central Bank to join the regulatory sandbox and apply for a banking license. BABB will be the crypto/block chain bank and bitcoin the currency!

@_date: 2018-10-08 12:28:17
Just read about the black card in the white paper. They will allow fiat and crypto to be stored side by side. Crypto is coming a bit later though. But we will still be able to store our Bitcoin in a regulated bank will the insurance that comes with it in the very near future. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 14:54:05
There is no way to prove the coins are lost. Satoshi hasn’t touched their coins ever but I’m guessing they still have the keys. Just because the coins don’t move doesn’t mean they are lost. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:45:42
Why would you want to run a node? It’s going to cost you electricity and you don’t make any BTC by running one. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 12:09:30
Look at the black cars. They will be storing crypto   Just not in phase 1 of the app release
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:39:48
Expedia takes bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-08 12:08:38
Actually they will be supporting crypto just not immediately. The way it will work is you can securely store crypto and convert it to fiat and pay a bill instantly and seamlessly.  
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:02:40
You would think those people would post about it in here though
@_date: 2018-10-08 01:08:24
Ina regulated bank they are
@_date: 2018-10-20 21:57:34
Well heck now I want to buy one!
@_date: 2018-10-20 21:20:31
I was just curious. Settle down lol
@_date: 2018-10-07 20:47:07
Relax and read about the project. This isn’t an old school bank. These guys are all about crypto and lows fees. And they won’t lend money and charge interest like old school banks. Instead they are going to allow for peer-to-peer lending!
@_date: 2018-10-20 21:57:56
Good point. Now I’m browsing them online and might buy one lol
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:32:18
Not to mention futures trading is all done in USD. No one buying or selling futures actually purchases or sells any BTC on an exchange. It has no affect on the price 
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:15:01
The trustee is selling them and returning the fiat to the owners. Just google. Mt. Gox recovered almost all the bitcoins that we stolen. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:08:38
Do you know a good exchange to buy on? Do you have to sell another coin like BTC to buy them or can you use cash?
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:58:39
Fascinating stuff. This is one of the few articles that properly sums up everything. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:24:48
QuadrigaCX is what I use to get BTC or ETH. From there you have to transfer to other exchnages that don't deal in fiat currency like EtherDelta
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:45:27
Are you talking about the private key? I highly doubt I would be able to find it if I ever had one. How would you even search for it in Finder?
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:11:40
Good point. But read this article. Seems like I spoke too soon. They already are making their own open source blockchain. From an investment standpoint (mining) I’m not sure how individuals can make money off this. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:08:14
Yah bitcoin isn’t even a currency anymore. I mean, when’s the last time someone used some to buy a pizza? It’s a security now like stocks. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:04:37
Why is he ridiculed? That transaction brought bitcoin into the public view and legitimized it as an actual currency. That guy should be praised. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:58:28
I have heard of IOTA. There was an interesting article about it:
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:03:15
Where exactly are they? If you got them a long time ago and used one the original wallets you could look for the wallet.dat file on your computer. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:16:22
I look at it as a Ripple competitor. So it’s not really a crypto lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:31:30
I like the idea of Monero, but also feel like the untraceable nature of it will keep it from going more mainstream. For many of us that's its best feature, but companies and institutions might shun it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:27:38
That’s the thing, I can’t remember. I don’t think so. I got involved with it in university for about a year and then lost interest. I can’t remember if I ever had any bitcoins. If I did they are long gone. This back in like feb 2009 so very early days when hardly anyone knew about them. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:52:01
Ok. Same thing though. I highly doubt it’s stored somewhere on the hard drive that I can find.

It’s bad news. The whole point of bitcoin is keep Wall Street and the banks out. This brings them right in and their billions will turn bitcoin into an investment instead of a currency. Satoshi created bitcoin in the midst of the Great Recession for a reason!
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:22:56
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:26:34
Yah that is basically how I understand it. My concern is that investors, both people mining for a reward of bitcoins or alt coins and people buying coins and holding them as investments (no one actually spends bitcoins on products/services) are set to loose out big time of every big company employs their own blockchain. They won’t need the bitcoin blockchain so the value will implode. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:28:11
Interesting. I've never heard of KMD. I'll look into it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:00:11
Thanks! I'll look into DCR. I also think TRON has potential. Forbes did an article on the founder, comparing him to Jack Ma!
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:03:50
This is crazy. I had no idea you could buy so much with bitcoins. Canada must be far behind.

@_date: 2017-11-15 02:51:27
I understand your reference but you can have a blockchain without a crypto currency and use it to verify financial transactions that are done with fiat currency. I guess my question really is: since blockchain tech is easy to replicate, what’s the incentive for established players to use the established blockchains (btc, eth, etc.) as opposed to just running their own? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:42:31

It’s been proven that they manipulate their volume. Everyone knows this. Use Binance instead. There’s whales and bots but the owners don’t manipulate the volume (that we know of). 
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:39:21
The TRON blockchain will launch in beta in March and go live in July. As for the white paper, the project aims to be a Ethereum competitor so a similar white paper and blockchain code is to be expected. When you have oBike, Grab, Alibaba partnerships and connections and now this guy talking about it, not to mention the crypto partnerships with Odyssey, DATx, SAY and QTUM how can you possibly say it’s crap? Also on the coin side, 100 billion total with 65 billion in circulation and 35 in escrow held by the foundation.

My guess is next year if Starbucks takes BTC. This is why I won’t invest in PundiX. I think traditional POS system will all be upgraded to support crypto in the near future. I can’t see it being that hard to make new machines that do this. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:50:40
True. I think if they moved the coins to the exchanges but didn’t sell it would help stabilize things 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:57:04
Well not technically. They banned ICOs and then they banned Chinese exchanges and now they have banned people from accessing foreign exchanges. Mining is still legal currently and Hong Kong wasn’t affect.

Well I think we should look to BABB. They are licensed for financial transactions and currently applying for a UK Bank License. They are also not a scam coin. Arguably the most open and transparent team in crypto.  Very responsive twitter and Facebook and the team is always filming from inside their workspace and answering peoples questions and talking about progress on the project. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:35:32
Does anyone know what this means? Is it just another scam faketoshi?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:38:11
Yah but less than 1000 people own 40% of all the bitcoins. How can retail investors with a few thousand satoshi each crash the market when the big fish are hodling? Or maybe Satoshi finally cashed out?

@_date: 2018-02-05 03:50:18
Seriously though. Bitcoin is meant to give purchasing power back to the people and keep the global bankers and Wall Street elite out. Futures just allow Wall Street and their billions to toy with and manipulate bitcoin!

The whole idea of needing fiat and a trusted third party to buy bitcoin is strange. Satoshi created bitcoin to get away from all that stuff. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 01:43:23
Why would go margin long when you already own the bitcoins?

Doesn’t everyone know Nick is Satoshi? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:02:45

No but I moved some to Enjin so next time it will be nice and easy :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:15:58
Also it’s centralized and using it is trusting a third party to act as a middle man. That’s what Satoshi was trying to get away from. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:59:39
He might be right though
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:26:10

@_date: 2018-12-09 04:59:02
Yah Satoshi never wanted exchanges in the first place. The whole idea is to get away from trusted third parties controlling your money. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:49:44
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:19:02
Never use a centralized exchange to buy bitcoin. The whole idea is to get away from middle men and third parties controlling your money. Buy peer to peer or on a decentralized exchange. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:19:37
Aren’t those futures contracts though? Shorts are when you borrow someone else’s bitcoin and immediately sell it. You then have to buy it back for them at a time in the future when hopefully (for you) it’s at lower price and you can pocket the difference
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:18:12
How? How do people do this? 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:50:31
It’s just a joke. It’s flared as humor
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:26:33
Lol. My point is that when a coin is green in a bear market it’s being pumped up by the scam teams behind it
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:19:35
It’s not. That’s why you can’t buy anything with it.
