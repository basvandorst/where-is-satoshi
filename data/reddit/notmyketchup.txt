Planning on accepting ETH as well? Not being an ass, knowing this is bitcoin sub and the shit I’m about to get, but using ETH you can actually transact wallet to wallet (not just exchange wallet to exchange wallet)

Pyramid scheme, promised fixed % returns, we all knew it was a scam for a long time. Looks like the organisers have been selling BTC all day and are now on the run (check r/bitconnect for earlier posts today)

Ah alright. Yes, bitcoin is the dominating coin.

Hahaha... this is a joke right? I think all of us are intrigued by the promise and possibilities of blockchains and decentralisation - but bitcoin is not the only solution, in fact it's just the first solution. You are not being attacked, people are just developing new things, the world moves on.

Which ecosystem has more engineers / computer scientists right now - Bitcoin or Ethereum? Serious question
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:49:43
Ether is better in that sense - much lower fees and still high liquidity 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:10:30
50% of you joined crypto over the past 6 moths and you already have *strong feelings* about bitcoin. This is actually quite funny.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:45:25
Wow. Is that what people in here really believe? That the Ethereum blockchain itself is vulnerable?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:08:58
Not working yet though so bit of a gamble 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:28
Why not try to transact in another crypto (Eth for example) to see how it can be if things were better!

Good point.

Fair enough. If 'store of value' is what you're looking for though - why not just buy real estate?

I'm an ethereum fan (originally all in bitcoin) but sometimes visit this sub to go back to the roots of why this asset class even exists. Posts like this is why I come back.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:09:13
I’d keep it to ETH and BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:34:01
Perhaps try look elsewhere. The blockchain/decentralisation revolution is happening, but bitcoin doesn't necessarily have to be *the only solution*!

Breadwallet is awesome! Love it for btc. Would be great if they built a similar one for Eth too.
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:32:53
I own far more ETH than BTC because I truly believe that it will supersede it in utility, and hence value. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:25:25
So much negativity in mainstream media, feels like some are loading up. Because if they really think crypto is worthless why would they even bother?

Ukraine really needs this. Very little trust in local institutions, lots of cash savings under the mattress, a currency in free fall. I hope there will be people there who educates the masses in how to safely store and transact.

My theory is that lots of chinese secretly wants to disobey their government. A ban on something just makes them want it more.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:14:13
Yes. I'm a big fan of bitcoin, but earlier this year I started lurking around Ethereum and found the community there quite refreshing. It's less religious, more techie so to speak. I'm not comparing ETH to BTC at all - two completely different things.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:43:28
Yep. They went against the 'code is law' philosophy, backtracked and forked the whole thing... Glad I wasn't there for that
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:54:23
Ethereum doesn't have a hard cap, but the inflation will become so small soon that total supply won't be much higher than 100-110m ETH (in our lifetime). We're all waiting for Proof of Stake over at the Ethereum!
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:05:47
Just sayin... 
Edit: check out Brave browser and also Metamask (Ethereum) plugin for Google Chrome... lots of people already working on this

@_date: 2017-09-21 09:30:36
Love this page
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:00:34
All valid points. Proof of Stake may never be possible, but I seriously doubt that the Ethereum Devs are trying to defraud investors with claims that they are close to solving it, so there is hope!
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:02:18
Ok: 1) these are basic questions on proof of stake that I'm pretty pretty sure you can find answers to by just googling (or asking kind helpers at r/ethereum); 2) do you seriously believe that Bitcoin and Blockchains will end all wars and 3) whilst current monetary policy is very questionable, what's wrong with capitalism?

Bingo. The next few weeks will be interesting indeed. So much FUD right now.
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:38:03
For all intents and purposes it kind of has (won't be more than 100-110m in our lifetime), and apart from the early ETH / ETC split its unlikely to split again. Again, I'm a big fan of BTC and might switch back at some point - but right now I'm liking ETH price wise more.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:51:45
Hmm. I think I get your point. In most businesses a simple database would work fine. I might be wildly mistaken and naive, but working in financial services myself I can see quite a lot of use cases for blockchains and smart contracts (taking away a human middle man). Here is one recent example  but let's just leave it here you're probably right
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:37:41

Bitcoin and other crypto is almost infinitely divisible. What makes you think that we won't start referring to mBTC instead (1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC). The price right now is 4.30 mBTC.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:55:13
What split?
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:40:19
Agreed, lots of people getting scammed by ICOs, it's a real problem (I wouldn't touch most of the ICOs with a stick!). Agree also that there is too much hero worship with Vitalik. But with smart contracts the Ethereum blockchain can become really useful in the business world, especially in financial services, which is (edit: another reason) why I'm buying it. I'm only looking after myself really.
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:21:25
This is true. GS deals with trade volumes 1,000x bigger than Bitcoin on a daily basis. A lot of GS employees have probably dipped their toes in, but GS itself, no way.

@_date: 2017-09-24 23:24:54
You seem to know the full story. I'm not saying that BTC doesn't have value. I think it's both valuable and important. Ethereum is just a different beast, don't think the intention ever was to compete with bitcoin. But for me I think ETH is a better buy right now, until something changes and I'll move over to BTC again. Just sharing my thoughts, that's all.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:44:55
Ehm. Well. One of the key reasons I invest in Bitcoin and Ether is because they’re censorship resistant. If governments try to shut them down it just increases the attractiveness, at least for me.

@_date: 2017-10-12 13:56:49
Ok my understanding is that there will be a chain split but due to hash power one of them will die very quickly. There has been some chatter about bitcoin gold - but my understanding is that this particular chain split has already happened and is being mined by the developers separately at this stage. So the opportunity to make money from a new chain like in August with BCH is not really there - correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:20:30

This is why I sold all my BTC for ETH a year ago. Ethereum's currency ETH is designed to have usage in a decentralised world where normal fiat wouldn't work.

With faster transaction times and better wallets etc, Eth can reasonably be used as a stand alone currency. (Which would be the case with BTC if there is consensus on the current debate.) With PoS Eth becomes a yield investment, all the while securing the ethereum blockchain which is used as a backbone to other crypto currencies and dapps. Not sure how to value any of this, but Ethereum seems to have broader utility. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:28:54
Eth is 'better' in many many ways
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:37:18
Frankly, even though I've read a lot on POS over at r/ethereum there are many things that I can't get my head around. To answer your question though - stakes on the wrong chain will get burned (i.e. there will be strong dissensentives to try to corrupt the blockchain). Not sure how close they are to solving all the problems with POS - but since I'm a bit of an environmentalist I really truly hope they manage to pull it off.
