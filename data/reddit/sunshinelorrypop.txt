If you have dollars on a bitcoin exchange. If it gets hacked and goes out of business, is that covered? (assuming the exchange is insured).

I think merchant adoption will outpace consumer adoption for quite some time. Afterall, they are the ones that receive the benefits of it immediately.

Yeah, I was wondering why I can't send a satoshi on bitcoinQT when it can be broken down into satoshis?
@_date: 2014-02-01 10:25:55
Thanks for the information. However, could anyone break down what the most interesting changes are and how they can alter bitcoin?

The last page of his link goes through the rake structure of SNG/MTT games.
I honestly want a bitcoin pokersite to succeed, especially because of the potential international playerpool. I don't know enough about how the inner workings of pokersites to make a call whether a place is overpriced or not.
All I can say is that I will only move my multiple thousand hands/day to a site with lower rake than pokerstars. Is this a reasonable expectation? I don't know and I'm happy to talk about it but as a consumer of poker, it's my biggest concern.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:41:47
I love the idea of rake free poker although I tried to load a table but it wouldn't load...

However, it was one of the contributors to it among other things which were also made worse by a centralised policy. So if your saying I should 'stay away from it' then you should say why I should stay away from it other than some ambiguous reason.


Shit will happen. There's nothing you can do to stop people from making bad investments and getting themselves and other people hurt from them.


Your simply equating flexibility with the power to issue money and allocate it. I guess if your want that type of power then it's something which fiat has over bitcoin, personally I wouldn't be into bitcoin if Satoshi Nakamoto could simply copy/paste more.

Could it be possible that this is already happening but just not perceptable due to it's relatively low market cap?

I'll take it seriously when newegg starts spending their bitcoins as opposed to selling them.
@_date: 2014-08-14 10:07:03
To lessen the currency conversion fees?

The UK has a lot of polish immigrants, perhaps they are helping with remittances. I heard another guy from the UK saying that about half of his customers on localbitcoins have an accent of some sort.

The price doesn't really have much relevance on the bitcoin bowl unless your thinking the bitcoin bowl is to get people that already are signed up with an exchange to purchase more bitcoins.
To me it seems to be mostly for companies to adopt bitcoin as a payment method. So the measure behind the success would be how many new vendors come online with this advertising campaign.
It's really impossible for the bitcoin price to increase in the short time these commercials were aired for a complete noob getting through all that hassel of signing up to an exchange and buying some bitcoin.
In all likelyhood, the price drop may have something to do with encouraging users to make purchases with bitcoin that are then converted into dollars sending the price down. I'm not saying this is the reason for it but it's certainly a possibility whereas there's absolutely no possibility the price would rise from people converting dollars into bitcoin through this campaign.
@_date: 2014-01-26 09:13:03

If they get rid of the hard cap, I'm dumping all of of my bitcoins. I got into it in large part because it will eventually be deflationary. If they change the cap, they would have done the bait and switch on me.
If an inflationary currency is better, then why don't they buy or make a crypto currency with that feature built into it.
@_date: 2014-08-22 14:04:46
That's the dream.
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:13:40


Take the '08 crash for example. The [Sub-prime mortgage]( crisis would be very difficult to emulate with bitcoin:
- the government wouldn't be able to set interest rates as they no longer have the monopoly on their currency.
- banks aren't able to lend out more bitcoin than they own.
Essentially the great depression and the bankruns of the 1900's happened for similar reasons. Take away the possibility, you stabilize the economy.


I don't really understand the moralistic argument. Is it moral to expect our children and grandchildren to bear the cost of the debt we are getting them into?
What I like about bitcoin is the fact that it is amoral. It can't be fucked and refucked by people pretending they know what's best for the 'people'. However, one major advantage of bitcoin of doing nothing is that you hurt the bad players everytime. Whereas low interest rates and QE have rewarded bad players.

My uneducated guess of the recent downswing is because dell to recently start accepting bitcoin.
I know that it was a while back now but ever since I've noticed that the price drops over the weekend and then recovers towards the end of the week.
My guess that it was able to sustain the $600 price because of the good news but finally the dam broke and a few investors got cold feet.

Yeah, they did quite a good report on it.

More specifically, the most likely places where we'll see the next bubbles will be under these circumstances (not necessarily order):
1. Simultaneous monetry pressure put on Euro/Dollar while the ruble/rupee is also suffering through low oil prices and other internal issues. The result will be a forced raise in interest rates (to negate a large collapse). This will result in rise in price of bitcoin.
2. A new set of world monetry stimulus injections of fiat into the system. It would be difficult to force through but one of the ways that fiat will still be popular for a long time could be tons of free cash for the banks, keeping stocks high and bitcoin cheap.
3. Large non-tech companies taking up bitcoin adoption. Right now, the market is saturated in tech companies so even when microsoft stepped in, that didn't plummet bitcoin nearly as much as smaller scale ones earlier in the year. However, if groceries are able to be purchased at many outlets, this would create a lot of sell pressure on bitcoin until the price stabalizes.
4. The accumiliation of bitcoin by companies which formerly sold at spot price. This should be the precursor to universal adoption. Even though bitcoins price hasn't risen this last year, the network has increased incredibly. When the many companies which are selling them through coinbase start to horde them (likely when 1 happens), this will really affect the price.

bitcoin will not do anything in a crisis. however, it can prevent them from happening since you can't artificially create more of them or do many of the funky things that banks and governments like to do to their currencies.
the major thing bitcoin will do in a crisis is make sure that the bad actors will go under, unfortunately that will hurt other people as well but that's life, not everything is perfect.

Curious, I like this technology and everything but there are more problems such as online collusion and using of bots. Right now pokersites scan for such algorithms.
Is this "provably fair" technology capable of tackling these problems too? Because I don't see people moving away from pokerstars until they do.
@_date: 2015-01-08 05:48:28
This is the kind of news I really love to hear. I really hope poorer nations adopt bitcoin before the big money starts to realise how great a technology it is.
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:38:02


But we agree on the subprime mortgage debacle? Then we have at least one contributor to it (and quite a hefty one at that).
Therefore my point should stand that it would have lessened it to some degree.


When I said "Shit will happen" I meant that no matter what currency you will use, there will be people making bad decisions. One of the things I like about capitalism is that the bad decision makers get weeded out and leave the economy more robust than before. This is what happened with Mt Gox, the bad player folded and now there have been several measures to gain trust back into the network, such as audits. As for the people that lost money at Mt Gox, well most were warned plenty of time before that and they didn't listen. Bad decisions...People hurt.


It's where you priorities are. Personally I don't trust my government to issue money or reallocate it. You do.
So you should stay in fiat and I'll keep putting a little bit aside in bitcoin every now and then.
Nice speaking with you.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:32:41
That's actually something which drove me to buy. I figured that if it's difficult for a person like me then I must be close to the beginning.
You hit the nail on the head though, probably the biggest thing which will drive adoption is how easily and securely you can obtain them.
However, all currencies must have gone through this adoption phase at some point, I think we've come pretty far, I just found out yesterday that can buy bitcoin at my local green grocers.
@_date: 2016-01-31 22:04:42
If you have a game with incredible variance like the one you described and if you have to gamble all of your money each time, then yes you'd more than likely go broke. However, one bet and cashing out would be a positive sum game.
@_date: 2014-07-11 08:55:06
how are they going to make it so people are paying VAT on their bitcoin purchases?
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:45:14
Gotta be honest, she doesn't.
@_date: 2016-01-31 20:00:31
If you're talking about a skill based game where it's possible to get an edge, such as in poker then yes.
If your talking about a game like roulette, then no. If the house has no edge, it's mathematically proven to even out in the end, no matter how much you concentrate or how big a risks you take.


Would you like to bet on that?
@_date: 2016-01-31 19:45:00
If the house has zero edge, it means neither side will have an advantage probability-wise.
This means that even if a player has a huge gambling problem, his winnings and losings will be neutral in the long run.
It doesn't matter how much he gambles, it will always be neutral from a probability perspective.
His habit may be detrimental in other areas though, such as it being a big waste of time.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:59:04
Is there an alt currency which has solved these issues and is more aligned with bitcoins vision?
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:45:30
In poker, how would it solve bot-use and player collusion?
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:41:03
If they have no edge, neither side will make money in the long run. Gamblers don't know when to stop, neither does the house.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:33:55
I just have the main one.
@_date: 2016-01-31 23:22:25
However in poker, people will absolutely love a rake free game that has an international player pool.
@_date: 2016-01-31 20:28:09
Perhaps the way forward would be more for zoom-poker type games where it would be harder to collude than if the players were able to choose what tables to sit at.
