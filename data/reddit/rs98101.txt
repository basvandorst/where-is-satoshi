I'm not sure it is a failure of imagination... more just typical engineering myopia.
You write: "I know, none of this helps the network or is in anyway essential." I'm not so sure... one needs humans to be willing to donate their time, effort, money to the cause. Failing to appeal to homo sapiens is, as you point out, a massive oversight. If people don't participate, network goes away. So essential? Yes, I think so.
The majority of engineers do not understand the human element in their work.  Most fail to grasp they have a consumer base or an audience that is non-technical. This hampers their otherwise brilliant efforts. Good engineering also considers the human user, and needs to be emphasized more.

Best use of Bitcoin ever. Won't be topped.

Short selling is legal. Naked short selling, not so much.
Patrick Byrne is on the record (Wired magazine interview) as saying he owns a sizable amount of Bitcoin, not sure where you have seen he doesn't. Maybe you're confusing it with the fact that Overstock.com itself doesn't hold Bitcoin.

I see your point, I really do, but I think you're getting ahead of yourself here.
There is not enough momentum yet to stop getting excited about new merchants accepting Bitcoin in addition to regular cash. 
The Bitcoin ecosystem needs all the PR and free publicity it can get at this point in time. Trying to discourage this now is a bad move.
So this "Bitcoin tax" you mention ideally will melt away to nothing other than a "one time" fee. In fact, if enough merchants adopt acceptance, it may be that the tax is never paid. Someone first comes into the currency by having it transferred to them in a payment. This can happen now! The more merchants accepting it, the more likely it will happen in the future. 
TLDR; It is too early to poo poo a merchant deciding to accept Bitcoin payments.

Hi Erik,
I hope you learned a lesson today. The WSJ is not a journalistic outlet. They have an agenda, and it is to promote propaganda for the existing financial establishment. Bitcoin is highly disruptive to that establishment, and is considered a threat. 
I appreciate your quick response, but, to be brutally honest, it was naive of you to expect anything less from the WSJ.

As a former Overstock employee who still has contacts there, I can confirm this. 
However, it may be simpler than waiting for the international partner to add it to their checkout. 
This thread has inspired me enough to put a bug in someone's ear over there and see if it can't prioritized a bit higher.

No offense, but this is seriously underwhelming news. It probably took someone in the Bing office all of 5 minutes to implement.
