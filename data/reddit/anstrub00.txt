Exactly, not panicking at all, just wish i would have waited 6 hours and bought in at a lower price haha

i would assume so. im brand new too but i put VERY little into this compared to most people
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:06:39
im not tripping at all, definitely did not expect to make a quick profit or anything at all, just thought my timing was unfortunate and funny

im thinking of buying some more, but gdax doesnt seem to let me create an account. worth it to just buy a little on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:50:20
going through the verification process now!! the point of this is just lower transaction fees right?

thanks. if im not planning to day trade at all is this really necessary? im really just interested.. i really dont understand everything with wallets and all but im working on learning as i go lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:16:40
makes sense. my verification is taking a long time, is it worth it to wait and potentially miss out on a possibly small downswing or should i just buy on coinbase?

im honestly investing pocket change compared to most of you... still feeling the excitement though!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:21:22
i didnt pay a lot of attention and felt like it was just gonna keep going up, so i just threw a lil money at it. lesson learned.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:56:59
keep trying, drive that price up!!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:19:44
worth it to buy some more? and is there any estimate for how low it will go? im obviously brand new, really have no idea what im doing
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:22:53
i have no idea what im doing but you are very welcome
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:39:42
thanks. i have been looking at this website for a while and it looks like i can only get up to ~68 dollars worth for $85. maybe i just need to get a bigger card?
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:38:55
i need $75 though...
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:20:44
i need to make a specific purchase for $75, so thats why i got the $85 gift card, for some room to spare. i plan to send the btc to the seller asap after i buy them so there should be no time for the market to drastically change

im not sure. it doesnt say vanilaa anywhere but it apears to be issued by the same bank, MetaBank?
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:27:02
