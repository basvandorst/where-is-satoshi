I would actually prefer something like this to ALSO be funded by crypto.

They said that when it was $1000? At what point did "Big investors" say to "get in" to Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:51:03
How is this comparable? You can grow more tulips, you cannot "grow" bitcoins? Tulips are not a currency. They are a commodity.

The entertainment value of Bitcoin is so high. I'm having so much fun  investing. It is not a chore what so ever

How far will this rabbit hole go?

Where could I buy some of these? The bills are even somewhat as quality as the US bills, I could think of a 100s projects I could do with a big stack of bills. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 16:20:24
Right?! I wanted to buy a bundle of worthless bills and do something cool with it, I have yet to find some at a price worth my time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:29:08
I completely agree, breaking 10k is a huge moment. At this point the mainstream media ISN'T ignoring this. It might get really out of hand fast

If Bitcoin has taught me anything, impulsive buying is more profitable than impulsive selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:44:24
Lol, but you act like you are better than us? Do you have any currency of any kind? You say this has happened before, but it hasn't. This is a completely *unregulated currency that cannot be modified by any government or organization. It is 100% secure, cannot be forged, or inflated. Every other currency ever is regulated by a organization, this is the first time the people can be in control of their own money.  You are just salty because you are afraid to take risks. Or even do any research of any kind before bashing strangers on a forum.

Buy on the dip. Think of it as discounted Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:46:26
Not cool man... You needed to do it, but still fucking traumatizing... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:55:52
Completely, but I feel that there is (at least) 2 main styles for investing in crypto. Those who buy and sell (trying to catch a profit from both sides) and those who just buy (like myself). For me, caring about market investment and maximum profit is something I don't care about, I just want to be in on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:41:52
God dammit, responded to the wrong comment. (8)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:02
Thank you everyone who sold for the discounted bitcoins! &lt;3

The "bubble" has popped once, and now it's stronger than ever. You need to lighten up, did you know this is also "fun". This has been the best form of gambling I have ever had in my life. The best part is NOBODY "knows" what will happen.
If you are so god damn smart, when do you think it will crash? I bet you one of my finest Reddit Gold's that you won't even come close. (If it even happens at all)
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:30:47
What's an average level? It could be $100, it could be $100,000? Nobody has a clue, and that's what is making this so incredibly interesting!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:41
I'm pretty small time (just under $1000 invested), I bought $50 when she dropped to 9400. I do this to keep my average portfolio cost as low as possible. I spent like $100 last night so this will hopefully offset it a bit. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:50:00
It will could definitely drop down once "everyone" has it. But even if it does drop down at that point, what will it drop down from? How much is one Bitcoin worth once everyone had it? I find this whole thing once fascinating.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:41:52
Right now I drop around $50 USD a week into it. I don't even bother trying to time the dips an rises. I have easily doubled my overall investment since September. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:40:21
Afterwards I would back up everything on a personal wallet. This way, if coinbase gets hacked, your money is secure. I personally wouldn't worry about it until you have over $200 into it. I suggest you buy a small amount now, get a feel for how it works. Then once you are situated, start doing research on how to make your own wallet. It's very easy and lots of more knowledgeable people than myself can help you with it if needed.

Sell me ur Bitcoin

I think he means 3/4 of all his "crypto money"
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:26:31
Coinbase is great! Although I do not suggest leaving your Bitcoin in coinbase for an extended period of time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:33:21
If you invest $100, and it goes up like 10% in 2 weeks (like it has been doing constantly for months), you now have roughly $110 now. 10% is 10% no matter what the prices. It is NEVER to late to invest. I literally just got 5% on $50 in the past 4 hours?  Not to mention all the other money I have invested. I'm making money each hour. Small amounts, but much more than the bank ever will pay. I made more money in one week of Bitcoin than I will all year from my savings.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:35:42
And that's fine. You can stereotype me however you want. I'm happy, along with everyone else on this subreddit. We all know the risks. You act like we are all dillisonal. This is a huge win for Bitcoin. But that's fine. Because little do you know, that if this DOES take off, it's you who lost the gamble. If Bitcoin wins and becomes an international currency, most inflated gov backed currency's will lose even more value. If you have ANY currency, you are gambling. Look up "Forex", congratulations you are now a "gambling addict" like the rest of us. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:13:53
For I shall buy even more!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:20:02
Bitcoin is still a great investment. It has steadily gone up 5% a week for the past few months. Name anything else that pulls those numbers? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:25:19
Every day is a gamble my friend. Everything has odds. You can calculate the risk of you dying in a car crash on your way to work tomorrow. I'm going to go have some fun. Maybe even make some extra cash, and you can do whatever it is that you people do. Maybe this subreddit just isn't the place for you? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:45:05
It's more of MY reasoning for why I invest, to me, the risk of missing out on this is means MUCH more than the risk of losing a couple hundred bucks. I'm 24, I have my whole life ahead of me to fuck up, might as well do something a little risky (with a potentially insane reward) that costs as much as going out to eat. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:59:53
That's a great start, I wouldn't worry about the wallet "today", but it is something I HIGHLY suggest in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:51:46
Okay. I'm sure you have never wasted your money on anything even you knew was stupid? I'm going to now sell all of my Bitcoin for a  125% PROFIT because you said so. Just because you don't want to do any real research on the thing you are basing on the DEDICATED subreddit, it doesn't make us "gullable retards". But I'm sure you know more about this than I do. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:18:56
That's the crazy part. Nobody knows? It could never Burst, or it could crash and burn tommarow? Nothing like crypto currency has ever existed EVER. So only time will tell. That's why I invest $20-$50 occasionally, because if it takes off, I at least a toe in the ocean of weath it shall supposivly bring. I can afford to skip out on a few trips to Applebee's in exchange for a entry into one of the most unpredictable lotteries in recent memory.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:14:09
Meh, I dont bet anything I'm not 100% okay with losing? So you don't think you could even come close to predicting that "bubble" you apparently know so much about?  I mean if you have so much self control, why wouldn't you buy some and sell before it bursts to really show is suckers?
