The idea behind crypto is that it is its own currency. There should not be a need to translate it into cash for it to hold weight. Right now many people are treating it like a type of stock: it is only worth something because it holds fiat value.
Businesses that do not have faith in the crypto, or need to give payment to other businesses for services will not accept crypto.

You know that's not what 99.99% of people think though, right?
The fact that Bitcoin holds fiat monetary value is what makes it successful. Nobody would have services or products to offer for Bitcoin that could not translate into real world dollars. As such, very few people actually care about Bitcoin and instead really just care about Bitcoin because it's worth money and a way to make more money.

I'm not a lawyer, but using common sense I would imagine that if they could prove that it took absolutely as long as they take to get it to you then you would be out of a case.
I imagine however that they are extremely liberal with their "burn-in" period and any professional in microchips or electronics would take one look at that and call them out on it, in court.
I'd say there are grounds for it. Just takes one person to start it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:48:07
Okay so how it works is people list what they are willing to buy at. Person 1 will buy 10 at $1000, person 2 will buy 10 at $900, person 3 will buy 10 at $500.
If you sell 30 coins to the market without setting your own price, person 1, 2 and 3 get your coins at their prices. So you'd get 10x1000 + 10x900 + 10x500 = $24,000. For 30 coins that's not really stellar.
This has the effect of lowering the average market price because you removed the floor and it becomes open season until people start listing new orders to fill the gap.
You can choose to list 30 coins for $1000 each, then as buyers come along and default buy, when you are the lowest sell order you sell to them. You would get $30,000 this way.
More for you! Plus when people buy from your listed orders it has the effect of bringing the market's average price up because those persons 2 and 3 will want a better chance at buying coins, so they raise their orders slightly.

I just started out with bitcoin. I was mining some Litecoins and am totally new at this. I looked at some forums and heard about mcxNOW. I watched the coin exchanges for about a week and just earlier yesterday I decided to try riding MNC. Believe it or not only about 10 minutes later the site went down.
When the site came back up I was devastated. I had 0.02 BTC in MNC that I couldn't do anything with! I just started but I'm really sad. I heard that this was an okay exchange and I made some small litecoin deposits and withdrawls to test the water and they all worked. So in the end, I'm back to square one. :(
Here's my account, again I was just starting to branch out and diversify.

Just out of curiosity when is your 5 GH unit expected to arrive?
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:49:30
The unfortunate issue is right now unless you are already heavily invested in Bitcoin there are very minimal rewards. Companies are making larger ASICs. It's like an accelerated Moore's Law. What's current now is already outdated. I mean it's really that bad.
Blame in part the ASIC companies for mining on your hardware before they send it to you. They bring ~~their~~ your hardware to the scene and mine for a while which ups the difficulty considerably. By the time you get it you're out of date.
Unless you make your own product you are going to have a real rough time breaking into the scene. Best thing you can do is watch the market and make good decisions.
Alternatively you can get into mining Litecoin which is impervious to ASIC technology. The benefits here are that difficulty increases two ways: volume of miners and quality of new technology. When new technology is released you have a CHOICE of upgrading or not and if you choose not to you're not really out much because video cards can still be used for other things. If you choose to upgrade then you can sell your old video cards for a much higher percentage than a used ASIC.

 - directory of Litecoin-related vendors and information.
Litecoin is probably the best coin to mine, simply because it was the first Scrypt-based currency and it has a stable following.
Plus it has direct ties to Bitcoin. When Bitcoin's up, Litecoin is up. When Bitcoin is down, Litecoin is down. That's a good signal for activity (shows people are interested in the coin at all) and shows that, given a bit of time it will make its own path.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:14:35
I haven't personally, I just know banks don't want to support their direct competition.
Think of it this way, banks are being used as pass-throughs for bitcoin. They don't ever get to see the money longer than it takes to cash it out. They have to have hundreds if not thousands of dollars pass through their accounts daily, yet they can't use any of it.

Sometimes though talking can save your rear. A long, long time ago as an adult I got caught and questioned by police in a parking lot. I had drugs (ecstasy.) I talked with them, were honest and listened to them.
They let me walk with a $60,000 citation and a court date.
I showed up for court. The citation was removed, I was found guilty of one of SIX charges and only had to do weekday forest camp for 6 weeks.
Talk about getting lucky. If I wouldn't have been so cooperative I would have likely done 2 years or more in prison.

With trust already at a high premium it would have to be a big name or a big player in the industry that is TRUSTED for having good business practice and good business ethics.
Lots of exchanges pop up from time to time and they are almost always immediately shot down with scrutiny and bias. Sometimes for good reason, other times because there's no established trust.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:33:15
Honestly because they can. They're trusted, have a track record and they can afford to do it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:02:09
I don't think you understand. Scrpyt is specifically designed in a way that can't be worked around. So even if ASICs are developed the difficulty is not going to have massive spikes. I imagine ASICs for Scrypt will consume less power and be more efficient but they won't be throwing massive difficult increases because many people who already mine will see little to no reason to buy new hardware that they have little to no control over.
You say that GoldCoin prevents big hash rate increases. Neat, so does LTC. If I have 50 GPUs hashing 700 each I am still pulling my share of the pool.
When it comes to the end of the day Litecoin is still the safe Scrypt leader. Everyone knows difficulty goes up when more people come to mine. But it also stimulates the economy which brings the exchange prices up. So in the end, like Bitcoin, it all works out.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:14:37
They have no way to enforce it. A country can ban the use of something but they can't prevent other countries from not participating, which would just create an even greater quagmire for the US government.
They're going to watch it and let it do its thing. Eventually I fear we will see a large fee attached to orders which is a 'transaction handling fee' which will be the regulation.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:10:03
The honest answer is yes. Getting those fans moving wears out the bearings, and heat is the enemy of electronics.
So yes, it can. It would take a really long time for 24/7 mining to take its toll but there is always the possible chance something could go wrong and a solder joint, a cap or even a wire could go early and ruin your GPU.
Note that with all that heat it can cause stress to other parts of your machine, so overall it's just really strenuous on your PC.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:27:38
Your best bet is honestly to GPU mine Litecoin, which is the second strongest crypto right now.
Mining Bitcoin is almost worthless with anything that isn't producing at least a GH right now.

I personally avoid trading in dollars. Volumes are low and people are skittish because it's real money. Compare the volume of dollars exchanged say between LTC&gt;BTC and LTC&gt;USD. Way less on USD.
If you see a massive nosedive in dollars just be happy you aren't losing your shirt. Like earlier today, that was a great time for me to get in on some action when all the altcoins took a dive. I got a little but but I also woke up pretty late. :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:12:16
The problem is we've reached a point where any new hardware is instantly outdated (See: Moore's Law, and then accelerate it exponentially by a factor of 100.)
If you buy say a terahash right now you might get in on the current difficulty. But in a month X number of people will have joined you at the same time and difficulty will increase by a factor of 2, turning your terahash into yesterday's news before you even got your ROI.
The big players right now are the ones who operate their own farms and are paying considerable amounts of money to stay on the bleeding edge of difficulty. If you can't commit to that sort of hardcore investment my best advice to you is buy low, sell high.
Alternatively, mine altcoins! With the money you have to throw at mining Bitcoin you can mine a much lesser difficulty coin and then convert it into Bitcoin later. That is probably the most feasible route to take, just keep in mind if everyone does this we'll be in the same destructive path that wound up with you not being able to take advantage of mining Bitcoin right now.
Just my two bits.

@_date: 2013-11-29 03:30:05
Bitcoin is currently a fad, or a hype. The fad will pass and it will eventually find its intrinsic value as a currency (which is guess what: 1 BTC = 1 BTC.) The nature of the conversion between USD and BTC will NEVER stablize in my opinion until difficulty is so far beyond belief that Bitcoins start to disappear and the economy begins to shrink. By nature of necessity BTC will then find its stable ground.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:33:13
I really am not trying to stroke it or anything, but I have had so much experience on non-stock markets such as this in games like Eve Online, Atlantica Online, World of Warcraft, etc that trading bitcoin feels right at home.
I won 0.5 BTC from an exchange that was doing a giveaway. I'm still waiting for my order from Coinbase to come through (it's supposed to be here tomorrow, but ehhhhh.)
Anyway as soon as I got it I transferred 0.4 to my personal wallet on my PC and played with the 0.1. In a day I turned 0.1 BTC into 0.15 BTC.
I transferred the 0.15 BTC to my wallet along with the 0.4 already there.
I then moved the 0.55 BTC to BTC-e where I have been fervently trading it for the past 2-3 days. Watching market movements, buying coins that have fallen stiffly and then pulling out when I make 20-40% gains.
With that one 0.5 BTC I won I now have 0.78 BTC. I haven't had tons of time to trade, but I am catching what I can. You can make more bitcoins! It just takes patience!
* Check out long-time histories at  to see where coins historically belong.
* Be careful of buying after you see a big spike. By the time you buy it's probably already too late.
* Know what your coin's lows and highs are for the past 5-7 days by looking at  if you are trading major coins, or  if you are trading in lesser-known coins. When a coin hits a low that is typical, buy in with half of your BTC, then when it takes a spike up buy in a little more. When it reaches a level you are comfortable with, sell.
* More isn't always better. Those lines going through the candlesticks are called lagging indicators for a reason - they are behind the action. When a lagging indicator starts to lean downward it's a safe bet that getting out is an okay idea. I have noticed a lot of people playing the BTC market look at those indicators as if they're in-the-moment, and I reap the gains from it.
* Don't feel like you must invest your BTC all the time. BTC isn't going anywhere, but overnight a lesser-known currency could plummet and leave you with nothing.
Have fun trading! You will do well if you are patient.
