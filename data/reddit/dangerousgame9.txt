Do the developers know your quoting 3-5 months, because the last one I heard from said years away. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:42:55
Oh wow that’s great your fees were only a couple bucks and you only had to wait an hour but that’s atypical. The average sat/byte is much higher than that and an average segwit transaction fee is closer to $15 at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:13:45
The nodes still VERY much connect peer-to-peer through the IP network.  What was removed was something not described in the white paper, sending to an IP address rather than explicitly to an address.  This was removed because IP addresses are easily spoofed and the security of that type of transaction would be negligible.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:08:00
Well with Replace By Fee could still take the transaction back with 0 conf.  It's "safe" to buy coffee to the extent that you trust the guy wouldn't steal the 3 bucks back, especially because he'd have to pay a higher fee than his original transaction to replace it, making the amount that he's able to steal back pretty low in the end anyway.

There are options out there that have undone the changes that don’t involve abandoning bitcoin for something completely different.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:49:07
Alright. Let’s happily go our separate ways. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:03:44
If the users are the ones making transactions and not some other group them it’s being adopted exactly as quickly as the users may like. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:06:09
You mean by adding the send to IP functionality in the first place? That seems like something that would have been nice if practical built on top of the protocol, not as a part of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:22
I know BTC is producing blocks faster than it's supposed to at the moment, but blocks still aren't coming in quite at 3 minutes.  Even if you pay the highest fee to get in the very next block you'll wait on average 10 minutes just based on the protocol, whether you use electrum or not.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:52:21
So what makes me cowardly? Expressing my opinion in a public forum?
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:50:06
With the rejection of segwit2x the scaling debate is essentially done. One side has on chain scaling and the other side has a plan for off chain Lightning Network!

I recently heard a LN dev say it’d likely be a couple years   
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:34:56
A lot of companies were accepting bitcoin a few years back. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:06:07
Not really unfortunately. The answer is technically yes, but it would cost you about $22 to buy $2 worth of bitcoin and you wouldn’t even be able to spend it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:42:57
Unfortunately using LN at all will require you to run a full node and keep your coins in an always-on internet connected hot-wallet...or pay a centralized service to hold your coins and monitor your LN transactions for fraud. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:08:05
You do have a cost basis. The fair market value of the payment. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:53:04
If people accept connections on their channel that they close you’d have to wait until the timelock is up on the bitcoin you pre-committed to the channel, then broadcast that tx on bitcoin and the. Try again opening a new channel. You’d have to pay the miners fee twice but the LN guy who closed his laptop wouldn’t be able to collect his fee as well I don’t believe. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:33:37
Unfortunately the average transaction fee is actually around $22, not $14. Average fees are $21.74 for today  
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:59:56
They joke around about getting it done within a month to half a year but at the end he says 18 months.

Can't use 0 conf safely since replace by fee was added

What about my opinion of his actions makes me cowardly? That I said it you and didn’t DM him out of context?

You should start a r/canadiansenate subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:33:01
Nope. Satoshi designed an amazing client/server system. If you hold your private keys only you can access your bitcoin! Don’t have to trust them with your $
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:38:42
So you want Bitcoin but with an 8MB block size? You probably don't want to put that in writing here.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:22:02
He’s right. There are cheap and popular bitcoin options. Keep looking for them...beyond Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:50:19
It was a specific type of fork called a soft fork that allowed for it to be backwards compatible with the prior version, correct. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:50:38
Bitcoin Cash has the same ten minute confirmation time as BTC, but since blocks aren't full they're confirming much faster.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:16:34
If it is an altcoin you're sending the address format is likely to  be invalid and your wallet won't allow you to send the coins.  If you're trying to send BTC and accidentally send it to one of the other Bitcoin versions it depends.  Bitcoin Cash is supported by blockchain.info so you'll receive it still, Bitcoin Gold and any of the other new forks you should still own it at that address, but you won't see it in the Blockchain.info wallet. You'd have to use another wallet to access it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:53:29
Not really true. Replace by fee is still not part of the protocol. Miners are free to include whatever valid transaction they like Bitcoin Core used to default to accepting the first related transaction. Now Bitcoin Core has a nice UI to conveniently perform a double spend and the miners will default to accepting the double spend. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:05:46
That does nothing to increase tx capacity. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:08:32
No need for a debate. It's publicly available information embedded in the blockchain.  Here's a screenshot of the past 24 hours of fees, transaction count, and market rate   With some basic math (fees in BTC X conversion rate)/transaction count we see that the average fees over the last 24 hours are just over $22 per transaction. I agree that a lot of transactions got in for less than that, but the average transaction fee over the last 24 hours is, to the nearest cent, $22.05.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:43:26
My point is that the payment isn't secure.  You can always try non-bitcoin ways to get back at somebody who steals from you.  Since replace by fee was added, they can trivially steal 0 conf transactions from you.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:37:50
LN is something different from Bitcoin Core. The Bitcoin Core dev team is not working on it. It’s supposed to be a separate group. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:31:23
LN requires everybody to run a LN node on an always on server. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:14:57
So I can’t have an opinion on the actions taken by people I don’t know personally without being cowardly?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:52:15
Unfortunately fees on Bitcoin Core are really super high right now. Averaging about $20. Id try not to move your money or else only move thousands so on a percent basis it’s ok. I know, kinda sucks. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:03:49
But quadratic hashing was only relevant as an attack vector, and since Segwit was a soft fork that problem is still there unfortunately. And hardware will have to be strong enough to be ready for that attack if it were to happen. Some other chains have fixed quadratic hashing via hard fork.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:49:55
Me too
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:06:25
I’m seeing this twice now. Did somebody tell you that using segwit would reduce your fees by 20x? I wish but unfortunately that’s not right. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:42:57
Pruned nodes should always work. They have a current picture of the complete Blockchain. They just can’t trustless bring a new node up to the current state of the Blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:35:40
A fork is when there's a change in the software such that prior versions of the software are no longer consistent with newer versions of the software.  For example, BTC had a fork in August where Segwit was added.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:57:35
They're hoping to be a joke on a huge scale while r/bitcoin is hoping to be a joke on a small scale, while offloading most jokes to other avenues.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:58:33
Cleaning up the code for the Bitcoin Core reference application I guess. Most of what they had been doing until recently had been preparing Bitcoin Core for use with second layer payment hubs like LN (modifying Bitcoin to introduce Segwit and timelock op codes) But there’s really not that many people working on Bitcoin Core code overall. It’s only a handful of people. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:41:04
Those aren’t too practical anymore with bitcoin as popular as it is. Not meant for small transactions anymore. I think they’ve died out. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:06:16
Coinbase probably plans on using Bitcoin and not LN. LN doesn’t need coinbase using segwit for it to work for others. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:07:27
Blockchain is entirely public. If you don't want anecdotal evidence check out   Average fees right now are $7.

I think he was trolling us.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:12:44
Unfortunately segwit will only reduce fees by 40%, and that’s after paying the fees to transfer your coins to a segwit address in the first place
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:45:57
Hmm, I don't use Blockchain.info so this is a little confusing, but their statement here indicates that they do in fact support Bitcoin Cash,   Good luck!

I think they’re trying to make us less disillusioned because “lightning network” has been promised as just around the corner for years now.

Looks like it may have been a disgruntled employee. After a few hours, it's already back to being Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:16:19
True. LTC is on Coinbase now so it’s much easier to get. Good reason to use it. But I’d say it’s slower since the average tx takes 2.5 minutes to be reasonably Certain you won’t be defrauded (since they have intentional double spending via replace by fee). Bitcoin Cash doesn’t have replace by fee so instantly you can be reasonably certain you won’t be defrauded. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:34:49
Do you think lightning is coming out next year? I had heard a year and a half at the earliest for the lightning network to launch and start developing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:01:20
What happens if you say that too loud????
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:33:46
Unfortunately no. It doesn’t really add anything to the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:54:44
Unfortunately no. Lightning requires you to run a full node. You'll have to be running the Bitcoin Core application on an always on server with a lightning network server running on top of that.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:58:58
Segwit shifts about 40% of the tx size out of the fee calculation, so you’ll pay 40% less in fees on the second tx after you start using segwit? Paying to a segwit address doesn’t change fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:49:47
That’s all 100% true, but what’s your price target for Facebook based on analysis of fundamentals? Is it over or undervalued right now? Valuation is hard, even when you know stocks and the company (or coin) in question. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:38:03
The problem with segwit adoption is people not making segwit transactions for miners to put into blocks in the first place. Miners aren’t blocking segwit. That was the first part of the two part NYA and it actually went into effect. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:48:51
Ok. So when you say the “case could be made” you mean “I would make the case that I would only be owed $1”. I get that it’s annoying. But at the time of the mistake you lost $10 bucks. You had the option of replacing that $10 through a purchase of BTC and you chose not to. The only argument I think you have is the time value of money. Meaning if you take the future value of $10 from July and calculate its value in today’s dollars using the risk free rate you may be owed $10.01. Either way man, Coinbase made it right by issuing you the $10 bonus now. I’m sorry you chose not to buy $10 more in July. If I had known the bubble we’d be in now back then I’d have thrown many $10’s of dollars at BTC myself!

Yea but wouldn’t it be better to sell near full price and buy coins??
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:34:41
Well it seems like we won’t get anywhere but I can say I’d drop the argument with coinbase because it likely won’t go anywhere. When this has gone before courts you’re always paid out in fair market value at the time of the incident. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:23:14
Most people on this sub think of bitcoin core as a store of value, not a routine means of exchange like a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:25:43
True but assume pessimistically a 5% CC fee and a 1% exchange fee and you’re still way behind. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:57:58
Even with off chain LN hubs that are better to equipped handle the load of actual day to day usage the bandwidth requirements will increase on Bitcoin nodes.

Yea sorry if it wasn't clear but Fair Market Value in USD.  So if somebody steals a car from me and drives it to shit and I sue them and I end up winning after three years I'm not just owed the car.  They depreciated it through use.  I'm owed the Fair Market Value of the car at the time of the theft.  I'm owed dollars, not cars.  And I'm saying it's comparable because you're owed dollars, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:43:10
I think it’s a little frothy and price will be coming back down in the short term (although hopefully it will stay north of $1,000). I’ve sold off some of my stake at these valuations. Long term bullish on Bitcoin as a cash replacement though! Just don’t rush in (or out of things). Take it slow. I know the price is going nuts and that makes it hard but be measured. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:12:03
It’s news that may have a negative price impact. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:14:09
My point is that Coinbase always promised you an amount fixed in $. You’re only complaining because the price went up, not because you were mistreated by Coinbase. And if you can’t feel comfortable saying you’d only deserve $1 then I think you can understand why I think you’re only owed the $10 coinbase promised and not the amount in BTC that represented in July. If you want BTC exposure I think you should buy BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:52:07
