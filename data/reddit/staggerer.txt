There is huge interest in mining all over the world. Using clean energy it can only do good marketing to Bitcoin.
China handed over the exchange business to other countries. Now they seem to be leaving mining as well.
That's excellent news to the whole cryptocommunity. A more diversified mining is great for everyone.
Price increase to expext if it's true.

If BTC fails, other alts will also fail. That's why there is no point in hedging and keeping many coins.
Some exceptions: LTC - a great supplement to BTC.
Platform currencies, like ETH, maybe NEO - but a lot depends on China.
Bitcoin will dominate in a lot of fields. Now it is slow and expensive to transact. It will change soon, making many altcoins obsolete.
Some years from now there won't be this many alts around.

Yes. Today. But years from now there will be cheap, fast transactions on the Bitcoin network and much more in one single block.

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:38:05
No. As transactions become 'dense', more in one block, the electricity cost of one transaction decreases.

You are right. But let's be honest. One million per bitcoin would need the whole humanity on Earth to stand up behind crypto. Unlikely.
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:33:25
It won't reach one million. It's not going up endlessly. Somewhere it has to hit its 'glass ceiling'. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:39:31
The US dollar (and fiat in general) will always be around. It's foolish to think that Bitcoin will replace it.

@_date: 2018-05-29 13:33:43
Yes, you are right. 'Always' doesn't mean forever. In our short lives (100 years at most) we can 'bank on' fiat. 
I cannot imagine masses of people throwing away their national currencies in the coming decades. 
In hundreds of years, when humankind finally starts exploring the solar system we will definitely need something more practical than fiat money. Until then it stays around.

@_date: 2017-08-25 15:27:06
All the way up!

Trading needs time and experience. Most of us are better of staying with our original professions and make money from that day by day. 
If you sell after a certain % gain, you can make profit. However, the market might go up again - contrary to your expectations. Now what would you do then?
Invest in the most solid cryptos, avoid the pump and dump coins. Focus on earning money in the outside world, follow the prices and buy in at the local dips.
When to sell? When the price incease puts you on a higher standard of living. Making 2x - 5x will never change our lives. Making 100x might.
Also: Invest big amounts. I don't agree with the slogan "Invest as much as you can afford to lose". No. Invest as much as you can AFFORD. Invest big.
That will be a game changer!

He referred to Bitcoin Cash, not BTC.
I don't think there will be such an increase in the coming years that we have experienced so far.
The more Bitcoin gets widespread, the smaller price escalation will occur. In the beginning, the early adopters could accumulate 10 000x, latecomers 1 000x profit. Newcomers can "only" have 100x profit in the next decade or so. Maybe less.
Bitcoin will have mass adoption with a dramatically slowing price increase. 
If Bitcoin ever reaches 500 000 dollars, it will be because of fiat crash in the world. I wouldn't like that.

But not skyrocketing anymore. No 10 000x, no 1000x, maybe 10x - 100x over several years.
Early adopters were lucky and wise. Sorry: Wise and lucky. They recognised its importance.

Yes, hodl. But if everyone just hodls, who will spend and use it as a 'currency'?
These days it is wisest to hodl.

What happened?
No fork yet. Supposed to be.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:08:29
Yes, good idea. Would have an excellent marketing value.
I can also see that a lot of people think it can't be divided, so it's too expensive to buy one single coin and they're left out and behind.
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:04:30
Great. Now the market can turn and go up. ��

@_date: 2018-06-04 10:18:29
Be careful. It won't rise endlessly. Somewhere it has to reach its ceiling. So it is not evident that Bitcoin goes back to 20k.

@_date: 2018-06-01 11:19:50
It won't be sustainable. Unless LN and other solutions can put much more tx in a block.

Give all three. Smaller amounts. Presents are important for family cohesion. Money for instant joy. BTC for long investment.
If you gave BTC only, they wouldn't get anything at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:43:12
It's fast. They send out in bulk (just like other exchanges) and cost them a bit, but free for us.

Just wait and have a popcorn.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:55:08
You can be left behind. Hodl and buy the dips. If there's no dip, dollar cost average.
If you suspect it is too high, just wait.
Selling at the top and buying back lower is not easy. It is a profession and definitely not for everyone.
Make money from your day job, save some and invest regularly.

Good decision, wise HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:36:04
Why are you so sure?
I hope BTC will survive but every second article I read is about Bitcoin's death / Segwit2x success / Bitcoin Cash surprising win.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:25:32
What the past few years have taught us: HODL to your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:03:21
Because part of the money flowing into BTC was expecting a free coin. Not realizing how damaging it would have been, just looking at the money part.
Now it is going to be interesting to see if 7,000 is a strong support.
If not: Down to a big correction.
If yes: A pleasant rise further up.
A couple of days and it turns out.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:07:10
The good old gifs are coming back.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:24:34
Buy and Wait. ��
It might correct down, it might go up more. Never know.
Two days ago celebrated and seasoned traders called for a correction from between 6,5000 and 7.200 to about 5,000.
Now look at the price.
If I had sold, I would be worried.
Now that I'm in, I don't mind any corrections. 
It's better to be in the game and sleep well than standing on the sidelines, waiting for the next correction.
Buy small amounts regularly.

Bitcoin has entered the parabolic curve. 
If it drops, people buy up instantly.
No more weeks of bear. Huge drops maybe. For a day or two.  Followed by huge bulls. Not enough time to send money from the bank account.
Hold on to everything. BTC, BCH, others.

Wait until the fork. If it survives, put more money in it.
There is a chance that it collapses. A small one but still a chance.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:27:58
Yes. You are right.
Bitcoin was intended to be a payment system. It will be but before that we need to tame it. Low volatility. To achieve this it has to reach a huuuuuge market cap.
So, first store of value and then payment.
Not very far. Not very far.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:37:26
Those are the big players. ��
For us, HODL is the key to success.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:07:08
First as a store of value. Then as a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:51:26
Exactly. I've been saying it since August. No hate, just work because the goal is very much the same.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:42:56
Yes. Definitely. ��
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:22:53
That would be great. Bitcoin's price would skyrocket beyond 10,000.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:43:44
Yes, I understand you.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:41:24
At this moment it is very unlikely that Bitcoin (BTC) ever reaches 200 thousand not even 10 thousand by the end of year.
People are disappointed with the cancelled 2x. We are left here with high transaction costs and long waiting times.
New buyers are likely to choose BCH over BTC. 
We have been fooled by "2x is enemy". We should have made the fork and would have time for future improvements.
Bitcoin in it's present state is unable to fulfil its original dream.
BCH wants to take over and fulfil it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:20:11
Lightning Network.
Other off-chain solutions.
This is the only way to scale. Big blocks are good for a while, but some years from now they won't be able to handle it.

@_date: 2017-11-09 14:34:14
Slow decrease and stabillization. The market is now wondering what to do. 
BTC has gone high this year. It is time to have a rest.
Maybe a correction down to 5-6,000?
Long term: UP!
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:50:37
Tether? CME futures? Bitcoin Cash attack? Segwit2x reattempt in January?
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:15:33
In 2009/10 Bitcoin was much less than 5 dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:11:11
No. Buy the coins instead.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:07:55
Maybe. 
It will be called the tether dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:39:51
Go into fiat on GDAX a day or two before the fork and then buy alts if they start to rise.
• BTC may go up further until the fork while you are in fiat
• BTC may still go up after the fork and you cannot buy back for several hours or even days
• Alts might not start to rise even after the fork
The best thing to do is HODL it through and buy more if it dips.
However, if Bitcoin crashes due to a derailed fork, it is best to be in fiat. Alts might plummet severily and a 'nuclear winter' can arrive to cryptoworld.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:17:01

Why? Really. What happens at 3,200?
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:30:27
Nothing is forever. We don't know if Bitcon can stand the test of time.
But yes. It is more practical than gold in terms of storing value.
@_date: 2017-09-09 05:32:27
Bitcoin will probably surpass the total Gold value on Earth. Why? Gold is restricted. It cannot be purchased, traded by everyone on Earth. Yes, it has real value, use (the material itself is useful).
If Bitcoin becomes a new store of value, and people on Earth would want to keep their wealth in it, than it might be worth much more than one million USD.
Moreover: We are - as humans on Earth together - getting richer. Today's generations are richer than one hundred, fifty years ago.
That's why the amount of wealth is not constant but probably will increase.
The guy who bought 20 000 Bitcoins in 2010 for 0.15 and sold most in the 2013 'bubble' and became a millionaire, said: 'I will sell my remaining 1 000 Bitcoins when it reaches 150 000 USD. But for that it needs to be backed by governments.'
Well, that is not the case - yet.
If we are to become an interplanetary species (living not just on Earth but on other planets - Mars for example) we need something different than gold and paper money. It won't happen tomorrow, but it might happen by the mid 21st century. By that time we will need a new form of money for trading and for holdin our wealth. It doesn't have to be Bitcoin but if people accept it and think of it as the new gold, then Bitcoin becomes the new money for this new century.

Invest. But read about the coming events.
It's never too late. I consider myself a latecomer after years of just following the news and investing only this year. Yes, it's a bit late but not too late.
Too late will be when the general public gets their salaries in Bitcoin. ��

One thing is for sure: 
This game will either be the story of the century or goes down to zero. Nothing between.
It will either go to the Moon (100k, 500k, even more) or crashes to the bottom. 
I would bet on the Moon story. A completely new, unchartered world is about to be born in front of our eyes. A bit like when Columbus arrived in the new world and hundreds, thousands, millions followed.
Invest small amounts first. Read a lot. Then go in with big money later.

Well. Buying a house on a loan is somewhat secure. 
Buying Bitcoin from borrowed money sounds logical because it is likely going higher. However, there is no promise from anyone for that. Moreover, these coming turbulent months are extremely risky.
Putting my own money into Bitcoin now is risk. Putting borrowed money might cause sleepless nights.
It would be wise to wait some weeks before that.

Every holder of BTC gets the same amount of BTC2x. However, not all users are aware of this Segwit2x.
What will happen to these holders of Bitcoin in the following situation?
1. Bitcoin2x  takes over.
2. Bitcoin diminishes, dies.
3. Months later a Bitcoin holder looks into their account and sees a value of say 400 USD (or even less) per Bitcoin Original. Cannot figure out what happened, has no clue that there's Bitcoin2x "hidden" in the private key.
4. User panics, despairs.

If you are not a trader, don't sell. There is no point in watching the prices ALL THE TIME.
My plan: HODLING for years and years, buying again and again when it seems wise. In the meantime I make money from my main profession and refrain from trading.
I can only lose time and money.
Real traders do it full time. If you can, do it. If you have a job, then don't try. You just lose in the long run.
When price dips, buy some more.
Only sell, when there is something extremely important in your life. Children need a new home, unexpected illness, losing your job or your spouse.
Keep it and wait until this new regime infiltrates every corner of our lives in this world. That will be the moment when crypto prices won't rise like rocket and start to behave similar to fiat. 1-2% swings a day or week. Just like the dollar, the euro. Years? Decades? Don't know.
If you want to play, buy and sell between BTC and altcoins. But keep in mind:
Is it worth? Time costs money. The time spent on watching the prices could be spent in a much more profitable way outside exchanges.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:26:35
