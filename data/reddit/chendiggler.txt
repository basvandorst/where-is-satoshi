Amazing! That .5 of bitcoin she has could end up buying her first home one day

I don't agree that morality is subjective because it's an extension of property rights. If you are not violating the property rights of others your actions are not immoral and no crime has been committed (in my opinion of course, which is subjective haha)

I don't really care about the opinions of the delusional. If there man in the sky tells them things that's their problem.

The whole process is coercive. He's been put in a cage for the crime of providing a service to the market.

Because their morality relies on myths. An understanding of morality through the lens of property rights relies on rational thought and logic. I can deduce rationally that one's moral philosophy will be more objective than one based on stories.

NO, BUT IF YOU GO WE WILL SHOOT!

Under current law it is illegal, but that's because the laws are immoral. Free individuals have no obligation to follow immoral laws.

It still has to do with property rights. They can believe that homosexuality is immoral but it is not. How do we know? Property rights. Two homosexuals being together does nothing to violate anyone's property rights, and so it cannot be immoral.

Agreed it doesn't need stability to be used by businesses, it just needs 3rd party services that can offer stability. That already exists, so the volatility claim is unfounded for the purpose of commercial adoption.
Besides we now live in a world of extreme currency volatility, which makes the volatility of btc less of a factor overall.

You may have to buy at much higher prices then... if it goes under $180 again it will go much lower, but if it doesn't...

From a purely technical standpoint, bitcoin could go to $100 and still be in a bull market. I will continue to buy little bits (haha), but if it reaches $100 then the proverbial truck will be loaded up.

In my experience when everyone thinks something is going to happen in the market, generally the opposite occurs. 
When bitcoin was around $500 I predicted it would hit $125. It came down to $180, if it holds that level the bottom will be in and it can continue its bull market. 
To claim unequivocally that "it's going down" is a prediction, you may be right but you could be wrong, only time will tell.

You're right, the price isn't $0, but they are losing 5 cents per kW hour. So essentially if you are going to pay 5 cents a kilowatt hour for someone to take the electricity you are going to generate, why not use the energy for something that will generate a positive or neutral return.

Get a cryptosteel, fire proof (and looks sweet)

I see your point.

Gold the element cannot be debased. The bill system that gives you a claim to x amount of gold can be.
@_date: 2019-02-16 23:42:49
That's not debasing it, that's increasing the supply. And the price of gold would need to be very high for that to happen. It's the equivalent of saying that bitcoin will become valueless one day because of quantum computing.

Something else gets more widely adopted, the value slowly drops over time. Is that likely? Who knows, but it certainly is possible.
@_date: 2015-10-10 14:12:48
I used "the" instead of "a" in the same way that I wouldn't describe the internet as "an". Which is telling in it's own right, and definitely strengthens your point. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 22:37:09
The reason why you're example isn't valid is because bitcoin is not the technology, it's just an implementation of it. The equivalent of the internet is the blockchain. 
Bitcoin uses the blockchain but so can other cryptocurrencies. In the internet example, anyone can create an email service. And just like aol and hotmail no longer exist, so could Bitcoin down the road.
