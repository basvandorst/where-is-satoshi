I would use it more often if I would save at least 5% over regular price for cash or credit cards. I get about 1-2 cents value per reward point (depending how I use them) with my credit card purchases and it costs me about 1% to rebuy from coinbase at the time I spend my coins. If I can get a 5% reduction in price i would still save an additional 1-2% per year on my spending and not deplete from my bitcoin savings unless I choose to. I can also convert that 1-2% savings into bitcoin by buying that much more bitcoin on coinbase when making my purchase.

Why would I be mad? I'm wondering how much money there is in this type of "journalism" on a per story basis. Especially one that makes the front page. I have a journalism background and see that the editorial content is high while the factual research is minimal. The site referenced doesn't even have an editor by the looks of the printed product. I could crank out stories by the dozens on a daily basis under these conditions and I'm wondering how much could I earn by doing so. I'll even guarantee my stories are free of grammatical errors and typos. 
Edit: grammar, proving the above (or at least I believe this level of evidence is sufficient for proof based on your archive of "stories")

We are talking about the value of bitcoin going up due to lost coins, not supply and demand. Any association is purely speculative unless they were your lost coins. Then you know a minimum number that are lost. Nobody can "prove" to anyone else how many coins are unrecoverable so this should have little effect on their value for decades. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:52:47
Are these numbers accurate. Just over 2 million addresses with something in them. I have 3. Are there less than 1 million users of BTC (avg 2 + wallets per user)?
Really? Less than 93,000 wallets worldwide have 10+ Bitcoins in them?
These numbers are eye opening.

If you understood economics it would be painfully obvious it is highly unlikely this will ever be a primary currency used by any major economy. But it can be an all important secondary one. Like every valued technology it's intrinsic value will increase over time...except eventually they stop making these (at all, zero production), though they can be used forever.

I know you won't like this answer but you can probably get more than that on eBay. Sell it there and just buy Bitcoin. The upcoming difficulty increases will make you earning minuscule BTC amounts with 7 Gh/s by February (if promised shipment times are met). You can probably get equivalent of 1 BTC now for it. It will never earn 1 BTC in its life. It is sad unfortunate fact. I was lucky to sell mine for more than I paid for it and bought BTC with it. My original investment has done quite well since.

How much do you pay for electricity? I pay about 9 cents per kWh and I make a profit daily. Ask for 3 USB ASICMINERs (333 mh/s each) as a gift (about $25 total on eBay) and start mining.

You are losing your touch. You used to be better at seeing a market drop before real numbers changed on the exchanges and used that to prove the bottom was falling out. But you miscalled this one. I was watching it and I saw a drop coming too. But $708 to $715 buyers kept adding orders to the market and the buyers at $700 never got their chance. I sold nothing because it never materialized. I was also watching those lines and the sellers were weaker than the buyers right after you posted. Either way I actually look forward to your posts. Not for insight to Bitcoin but rather just to watch what you do and how you do it. Pretty sure everyone on here knows the "why".

What are you guys talking about? Quoting in mBTC because the "barrier to entry is higher"???!?? 
The last time I checked the barrier to entry is 10 fuckin' cents. This isn't stocks. You don't have to buy a full one. Would you ever say the barrier to entry is too high when choosing a mutual fund or exchanging money to go on vacation? No, you choose a fund or a place where you are comfortable with your investments rewards. For mutual funds that means depositing $100/mo so you dollar cost average. For vacation it means you go somewhere with an affordable visitor's cost of living. 
The person that could afford to invest $100/ week 3 months ago and didn't is the same person that can afford to invest $100/ week now. Do you really care that now $100 only has potential to turn to $1000 instead of $3000 like a few weeks ago? It's the same hundred dollars. Your perspective could use some assistance.

If someone gave you free mining hardware and free electricity you would make a profit. Here is some quick help. Figure out how many BTC you can expect to earn by the end of the year using mining calculators. Add 30% (arbitrary  to expected future difficulties (nobody knows future difficulties, these are speculations). Now that you have your (best guess) 8 week BTC earnings convert that to current $ value. This is the most you can spend on hardware before breaking even. If you pay for electricity you must spend less. How much less depends on electricity usage of hardware and cost of electricity. Now take that $ value and check out what you can buy in the marketplace for the GH/s you used in your calculations. My guess is you can't find anything. Think BTC is going to the moon? Just buy BTC.

If BTC is rising something else must be falling. In this case it is OP's US Dollar. If BTC is increasing in value 4.17% hourly (100%/day in your example) the conversion value of your cash on hand is shrinking throughout the day. Right now, items are priced in USD so this is the constant. If you use BTC to make a purchase and don't convert dollars immediately at the same rate (if doing this, why pay in BTC?) you will have less money in 24 hours than if you had just spent USD on that purchase. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:54:32


Better to reference it by percent. And don't wait until  a 50% increase to point it out to them. Learn why it is down near $1000 after reaching highs 17% higher less than 48 hours ago. I would talk to your parents about it every 10% change up or down. 
You don't want to hit them with a ton of bricks at $1500. Make sure they take notice in the $1100's (as well as $900's). By the time you are up 30% (who knows when) they may be warming to the idea. 
Break them in slowly. The only thing they know about the intersection of Internet and Money is that an area exists where you are very likely to lose your dollars. They are looking to protect you so you need to prove to them you know what you're doing before they let you risk real money on the internet.

Ok. I normally don't do this but I will take you at your word. BTC is global currency because it can be sent over the internet. It is difficult to buy it over the internet. 
Reversals are when a credit card holder uses his card (or someone else does fraudulently and you call the bank that issued the credit card and tell them what is wrong. They will then freeze that transaction and ask the merchant that charged the card for their side. Then the bank and/or Visa (for example) will make their decision. Electronic goods are not covered under Visa's policies so the merchant will lose. The bank will take back their money they gave the merchant and the merchant can not force the BTC buyer to return the Bitcoins.

Add in that most bitcoin people feel strongly (or should) about this news because it affects them more than just being an American would. Why are you pointing to Americans when they don't respond to your opinion? Why aren't you calling out the Belgians right now for their lack of comment?

You are using a model for a "tech company" yet this is just technology. No earnings, no revenues, no profits, no losses, etc.
Investments in "tech companies" or other businesses have limits on what they can accomplish because the business can not take unlimited risks. 
Bitcoin does not have to worry about this because Bitcoin does not have bills, stockholders, or anyone to answer to. 
It also does not need to take on risk - nor can it. 
Instead it's value is determined solely by how much the people who have it are willing to sell it for and how much the people who want it are willing to pay for it. 
There is not a single reason Bitcoin can't trade for $10,000 per Bitcoin or more. However, the only reason it will is because people will pay that price for it. 
Nobody know when (if) that day will come.

These numbers make it look more like it's still in the womb and not yet in the second trimester.

You means authorizations on your credit card?

I fucking love vulgarities but this is out of line.

You can counter almost ANY argument with an "If x, Then y" response. It doesn't make the logic sound by doing so.

I can't believe I couldn't find that. Thank you.

TL;DR: Don't take advice from redittors. Here is some advice...
@_date: 2013-11-11 11:19:44


Prices won't go up because nobody can 100% prove which coins are lost.

I understand the fascination with snap chat is the pic self destructs in 15 seconds but is there anything stopping a recipient from just capturing a screen shot in the 15 seconds?

What time did Mt. Gox close on Friday?

Only way I know of is to make 6 identical reddit posts in 6 minutes.

My apologies. You have obviously done your homework here. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:42:25


This is exactly when they do sell here. Why would you not want to sell when the market is high, if that's your thing.

I know it sucks. I'm lucky. Coinbase has never fucked up one of my transactions. For an American it is the easiest way to play the game. 
Getting back to "I know it sucks". That's the way life is. And as American we think if this company isn't going to transact business perfectly or at least make it up to me when yet don't then I'm not giving them my business. The problem is even with Coinbase's active complaints against them they are still the best place in the country to quickly buy/sell Bitcoins while keeping risk low. 
Don't let 1 "non-minor" inconvenience from a service provider without much domestic competition keep you from bitcoin or force you to pay more for your bitcoin or take on more risk to obtain them. If it happens a second time - then maybe take a harder look to see if it's worth it. But 1 problem? Everyone deserves a second chance when there was no ill-intent involved.

Wow - what a read, bfl. I mean harbingerx81. Just wanted to point out you use plural "you" way too often instead of the inclusive "we". You use each 9 times in your explanation of how things went wrong for you, er, them. You would only be using "we" if this were legitimate. 
Edit: grammar. Feel free to edit your "you"'s to "we"'s and you might fool a few more of your customers too. Do you have some new products coming out soon? If so this post makes perfect sense. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:03:07
Correct, probably about $10 this week. $7 (max) per week after next difficulty change. 3rd diff change is $5/ week. 4th diff change may give you $2/week. 2014 - you will earn very little BTC with 5 gh/s.

The speed was just a reference to the last several hours. I have always posted that I hope for a sell off or a slow in growth to give me more time to accumulate at lower prices.

Nope. You are free to melt your gold and turn it into a gold ingot or ring.

Seriously? It's a less than 5 minute phone call to the bank that issued your credit card. Out of curiosity what did you think was required of you to get a new card number?

I appreciate that you are here and responding to comments. 
Your primary flaw for Bitcoin is that nobody wants to spend it because it is going up in value and why would you spend bitcoin today that will have a greater value tomorrow?
If Bitcoin does nothing but go up in value the option you have is to convert everything you own to Bitcoin and convert what you need to cash. By using a site like Coinbase it is easy to have funds in your account in a week. There may be future ATMs to solve this too. 
If Bitcoin goes up and down you can ensure you don't lose out on tomorrow's gains by spending Bitcoin today by buying more bitcoin at the same time that you pay in bitcoin. Again, easily accomplished on Coinbase with their phone app.
Also, even with lost coins there are a maximum of 21,000,000,000,000 units while still leaving the 7th and 8th decimal spots to use traditional "cents". It won't matter if many coins are lost due to its divisibility. 
Edit: additional response and grammar
If you respond to my points I will upvote you for visibility.
