Yo, this is months later... I had to literally threaten to (meaning file to) sue Coinbase to get my own money.  Those fucking asshats froze my account for the better part of a year.  I finally got access again and immediately removed my holdings to a more secure location.  My BTC is now much safer.

Given that this is a Japanese ad and that the term Sanpaku is a Japanese term for the “three whites” of the sides of the iris being shown, I don’t think that this is just an instance of the model looking upwards.  While it’s likely that the phenomenon coincides with standard model poses with the eyes looking upward, that may be a cultural coevolution to why bottom side Sanpaku and top side Sanpaku have the meanings they do.

A little tangential, but she has bottom side sanpaku eyes.  I think other notable people with bottom side sanpaku are JFK and Audrey Hepburn.  Topside sanpaku is unsettling to see - looks like perpetual surprise - and can be seen in photos of Charles Manson.

For real.  Lesson learned. I need to look into a hard wallet.

Not sure how this works or who is to blame, but my bitcoin account got blocked when I went to Cuba.  Probably the exchange’s fault, but most of my expendable income is still inaccessible months later now. So even if they can’t sanction the currency, they can sanction the mediating body for its transfer...
