It's a conservative newspaper with a conservative readership of traditional investors, traders and financial worker.  i suspect bitcoin reminds many of those with a few grey hairs of some of the worst excesses of dot.com hype and articles are written accordingly.  I would be more worried about the negative press that bitcoin gets in the tech press.

TARGET2, the real time gross settlement system for the European Union handles around 90 million transactions a year. The highest daily volume in 2014 was just under 600,000 transactions a day.  This system handled a total turnover of €492 trillion. 20MB is absolutely fine for a global settlement system.

Over 100% of GDP in debt may not be great, but it is perfectly serviceable providing it is at a low rate and over a long time.  Think of it this way,  many people take mortgages out at about 300% of their salary over a period of 20 years or more.  A significant portion of your income goes on interest payments, but as long as you don't lose your job or take out more loans you can keep swimming.  The problem comes when you, like Greece, lose your job and can't get another.

ISPs act everyday to take down grossly offensive material, credit card companies work with the authorities to identify individuals doing morally reprehensible things.  You can't get rid of it, but you can at least make it harder to operate. 
I fully appreciate I am in tiny minority, but the community could act to mark any transaction that has been identified as one involved with child pornography.  Some exchanges may wish to deal with that, others may feel that they shouldn't .

One of the things that concerns me most about the Gavin/Hearn fork is that you are basically firing the Lead Developer and overriding the views of the other core devs.  I completely understand why Wladimir doesn't want to get involved in this, but he does good work and it seems a bit harsh that he is going to be ditched just because he wants consensus.  Who is going to be in charge of the project after the fork,  will it be Gavin, Mike or somebody else of their choosing?

Your example is dependent on the policies of the company and is not a bitcoin feature.  A bitcoin refund might just as easily take a week or a month or never happen if the retailer disputes it.  A smart contract system however may be possible with automated refunds, but I am going to assume that is not the case here.

Since no one else has said it yet - money has been digital in the west for a long,long time.  The final piece is getting rid of cash for small value transactions which is where contactless is supposed to come in.  Apple Pay and Android Pay and hopefully one or two bank led instant systems like Zapp will probably kill off cash completely for the youngest generations in a few years.  It will however take a lot longer to get statutory approval to stop printing cash altogether as many people have emotional attachments to physical coins and notes. Bankers are the group least likely to want to retain any physical cash at all.

[Key Summary](
If you are interested Tim Swanson did a good write up recently about the latest permissioned ledgers:
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:35:21
Aside from the obvious fundamental issue of firing competent British IT workers and replacing them with cheaper less experienced Indian workers, the problems at RBS/Natwest stem from a batch processing error, not the payments infrastructure which is modern and extremely reliable.  How does Bitcoin resolve a batch process not firing when it is supposed to or are we going to talk about OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY because at least that would make some fucking sense.  
@_date: 2015-06-16 08:38:10
The report doesn't mention the word 'blockchain' once.  Bitcoin is referenced once.  The phrase they use is 'distributed ledgers' as in


Eris Industries and HyperLedger, are also developing new ways to
exchange data and assets enabled by the technology. It is only a matter
of time before distributed ledgers become a trusted alternative for
managing large volumes of transactions.

Thank you for running these tests they are very interesting.  Too soon to draw conclusions, but the network coped with the extra load pretty well and far better than I was expecting even if it wasn't the full volume.  Apart from the moaning users also don't seem to have been particularly inconvenienced especially if they paid a higher fee.

Good question.  The introduction of EMV has been linked to a decrease in card present fraud and an increase in card not present fraud in several countries. CC companies have tried various things to reduce this such as 3d secure and biometrics.  Using Apple Pay or Android Pay as the authenticator online may prove to be the most user friendly approach. 
Edit: I would also add that many retailers don't believe there will be an uptick in CNP fraud.  When the EU went through this Internet commerce was still fairly new and address verification is still largely unused.  A more sophisticated fraud detection platform and experienced merchants drawing on global experience may mean no migration to other types of CC fraud.

Well it depends on the usage.  If you want to use a cryptocurrency then by all means a non permissioned ledger may be best, but if you are tracking financial assets that must meet regulatory standards perhaps something else is needed.  
'With permissioned blockchains, there are entities who can be held responsible, scrutinized and held legally accountable. It is this accountability of reversals, rather than its nonexistence, that renders permissioned blockchains more suitable for higher- stakes activity.' - Swanson

Hansard Transcript for the interested.  The first speech by Steve Baker is worth a read:
Hopefully the TV archive will be up soon.  
Edit: longer quote from Steve Baker
'We should welcome the Chancellor’s recent interest in crypto-currencies and his commitment to make Britain a “centre of financial innovation.” Imperfect and possibly doomed as it may be, Bitcoin shows us that peer-to-peer, non-state money is practical and effective. I have used it to buy an accessory for a camera; it is a perfectly ordinary legal product and it was easier to use than a credit card and it showed me the price in pounds or any other currency I liked. It is becoming possible for people to move away from state money.
Every obstacle to the creation of alternative currencies within ordinary commercial law should be removed. We should expand the range of commodities and instruments related to those commodities that are treated like money, such as gold. That should include exempting VAT and capital gains tax and it should be possible to pay tax on those new moneys. We must not fall into the same trap as the United States of obstructing innovation. In the case of the Liberty Dollar and Bernard von NotHaus, it seems that a man may spend the rest of his life in prison simply for committing the supposed crime of creating reliable money.'

20 years ago Netscape Mosaic had made browsing the web on Windows easy.   You could buy things with your credit card and find all sorts of interesting things relatively easily.  Yahoo and Altavista worked fine for search and creating your own website was was easy.  My first degree was in Economics  and even using Lynx on a VAX wasn't that hard.    
I never used BBS prior to 1994 because it was slow, a bit geeky and the phone charges were expensive.  This would be a better analogy.  
It is also true that a number of people thought using a credit card online was incredibly insecure and wouldn't catch on. Some of these people ended up creating digital currencies like ecash and mondex. They overestimated how much people value security over convenience.

I don't know why so many people in bitcoin pay so little attention to altcoins.  Very, very few altcoins launch as pure Proof of Work.  Most are hybrid coins or use a different consensus algorithm altogether.  Mining was important for initial bitcoin distribution and to assign an initial value, but no one else need that anymore, certainly not if you command the mindshare that Google or Facebook do.  Value can be assigned by initial stake, share issue or anything you like and moved immediately to a proof of stake variant.  These can be more secure and more efficient. It just remains to be seen whether anyone will bother taking on bitcoin.

I am not a big gamer, but I understand that several people have studied the effects of gold farming and real money in WoW. It may be appropriate in new games where all players start at the same point, but it would dramatically affect existing gamers if introduced to existing games.
Official Blizzard response circa 2008:
Q: Have you considered micro-transactions in WoW?
A: We chose to go with the subscription-based model instead of that approach. We've taken the approach that we want players to feel like it's a level playing field once they're in WoW. Outside resources don't play into it -- no gold buying, etc. We take a hard line stance against it. What you get out of microtransactions is kind of the same thing and I think our player base would feel betrayed by it. I think that's something else you have to decide on up-front instead of implementing later.
Q: But it might make it easier for the casuals to catch up....

But here is the damn point. The Excecutive who was whining about how his devs won't show up should probably consider hiring people who make VOCAL points on the mailing list. Or maybe he should consider that his developers might know his business model is shit and if they DID say something, it would be CLEAR to the world that only an idiot would use their companies services, and kill the company.
Would you rather hear of vulnerabilities and scaling limits on bitcoin-development, or would you rather hear about them by a chorus of "They got hacked, their code must suck", but AFTER the fact.

SEPA is a good model for the integration of payment systems between countries, but has limitations.  I would expect fees to come down if there was competition though and your bank will have to join in soon.

Hats of to Nick, but Satoshi doesn't mention smart contracts in the whitepaper.  Nick also says the following in regards to PoW.
"Nakamoto improved a significant security shortcoming that my design had, namely by requiring a proof-of-work to be a node in the Byzantine-resilient peer-to-peer system to lessen the threat of an untrustworthy party controlling the majority of nodes and thus corrupting a number of important security features."
I tend to view Satoshi's work in a similar vein to Crick and Watson in the discovery of DNA - not that I am comparing the value of the work, just the methodology.  The jigsaw pieces had been largely discovered by other scientists over a number of years, but it took a different type of genius to put them altogether into something beautiful. In Szabo's words - what seemed obvious in hindsight, was quite non-obvious in foresight.

Banks are not replacing internal ledgers, but rather are interested in a shared platform that any bank can use. The trick of course is to get banks, institutions or users to commit to your platform over another. There isn't anything revolutionary going on here except the new platform has less setup costs than managing a vast global network of secure never fail data centres.  It also has the advantage of not having to trust any other banking group to run it unlike your replicated databases.  
The bitcoin community's reluctance to properly address AML concerns and mining centralisation may ultimately push financial institutions to a new distributed ledger platform, but the technology even without bitcoin does hold some advantages - cost and settlement time being the main ones with the big caveat as I said before that you can get everyone to agree on the new ledger technology.

I think charging people to send money from one bank to another in the digital age is not due to fraud, but is an easy way for all banks to make money from very little effort.  In many countries these charges are paying for 'free' banking - current accounts, cashiers and the rest.   These charges exist only because there has never been a way to subvert this process.  Now there is.  Banks will have to remove these charges or lose this business.  I suspect charging for current accounts will likely become more common place and they will lose even more business as people seek alternatives.

M-PESA - a small mainly African mobile payment network is currently handling about 7.5 million transactions a day, substantially more than Bitcoin is capable of processing today.  
Although it is worrying to me how few transactions there currently are, if Bitcoin does take off, growth could be rapid.  You can't assume that the system will just gracefully adapt.  I would like to see limits lifted if they are not needed so we can have confidence that there are  no issues in handling several million transactions a day.

The article gives good reasons to bullish about the future of M-PESA, but not so much bitcoin.  M-PESA's success in Kenya was achieved with strong branding that focussed on trust, heavy advertising, managing the retail channel to achieve a rapid expansion of retail outlets and low barriers to adoption with free deposits and easy experimentation.  It also had the buy-in from its conception from Kenya's central bank.  In short it is about as far from bitcoin's strategy as you can get.  It is also interesting to note that M-PESA has been most successful in the less affluent parts of Africa. It has so far failed to take off in South Africa, a much richer country than Kenya, where the proportion of people who use credit cards and bank cards is much higher.

Remove the oil revenues from the balance of trade and UK current account deficit goes from 4% to 7%.  Borrowing goes from bad to unsustainable and the economy would be in a dire state leaving it dangerously exposed to any number of small shocks that could push it over the edge.

EDIT: 
Also, I have to point out that using the Faster Payments network ensures most UK bank account holders can transfer funds to any other UK bank in a few minutes for free. This delivers over 1 billion payments a year, worth almost £1 trillion. Bitcoin has no equivalent capable ACH mechanism currently. The SEPA system ensures I can transfer funds to any EU bank in 1 day and the European Real Time Gross Settlement system Target2 can process final and irrevocable payments between banks in a target time of 5 minutes.  I am not going to debate the merits of fiat, but the underlying infrastructure in the EU and UK is far from inferior.

Bitcoin can learn a lot from M-PESA.  People are hugely conservative with their money and trust is key. The first thing M-PESA did was establish the regulatory framework in which they could operate. After that they engaged upon a massive marketing campaign to raise awareness and build the brand.  They provided a consistent and secure customer experience and created a program that incentivised the retail agents at the ground level to support the system.  
It should be noted that they have had much less success in countries with an already mature financial sector, notably South Africa.  They are re-launching this year, and I think its success or lack of will determine whether they push further into Europe or not.

You sound like you are genuinely interested in helping which is great, but it is important to work with the people who would be using this service and understand their point of view and their problems.  There was a very insightful interview recently on letstalkbitcoin about a man who went to Kenya to explore how bitcoin could help the locals which I would recommend listening to.
I would also urge you to think about possible non-bitcoin solutions to remittance problems.  There is a company based in the UK here called TransferWise which are also offering cheap remittance, bypassing bank transfer costs, but they are doing it without bitcoin.  They don't serve Nepal currently, so it is something you could either do independently or work with them.  There is also M-Pesa which launched in India this year. If it becomes successful in India, it is feasible that it will spread to Nepal, whereupon services like Bitpesa may become useful.
There are costs in remittance which may be inescapable, especially if you are using cash.  Governments require you to ensure that you are not funding terrorism and not engaged in money laundering.  Regulations are getting increasingly stricter so be careful.

This prompted me to take a look at the charts.  The Argentine Peso started the year at 6.52 Pesos to 1 dollar.  By the end of January it was already down to 8 Pesos to 1 dollar and is currently 8.15.  Not good, but it has been relatively stable for 5 months.
Bitcoin started the year at 5320 Argentine Pesos to 1 bitcoin reaching a maximum of 7,686 at the end of January,  before dropping to 869 Pesos to 1 bitcoin on 20th of February.  It was just a flesh wound apparently and Bitcoin is currently about 5,083 Pesos to 1 bitcoin. That was some serious brown trouser time for the holders. 
The Argentine Peso may have some serious inflation, but that is why God invented Gold.  On January 1st 1oz Gold was worth 8000 Pesos.  It is now trading at about 10,676.  A nice increase for the traditional inflation hedge.  
Looking at these charts it is hard to recommend the financially poor or the technically poor put any savings into bitcoin.  Gold or even dollars look like the safer bet.

Literally nobody, nobody thought the Internet was a joke in 1994.  Some people were worried about entering their credit card details to buy stuff,  which in part encouraged David Chaum to invent a cryptographically signed digital currency.  Turns out,  people don't care that much about security.

Everyone is being very sensible today.  Let me qualify my remarks by saying that the marginal cost of increasing the number of transactions is small and Bitcoin is capable of resolving the security and scalability questions if there is the will. I just want people to look at the problems seriously and deal with them.  You remind me of something Peter Todd said  a while back though so I will quote him:
"Transaction fees aren't fixed - it's a supply and demand auction for a limited resource. Transactions definitely do not have to increase in number to keep miners interested - it'd be just as easy for fees to increase. An oft-quoted possible future scenario is for Bitcoin to have a trillion dollar market cap, and 0.5% of that market cap going to miners every year in the form of transaction fees - $5 billion a year. That leads to roughly $20/tx, similar to wire orders. (obviously the blockchain will be used for settlement and people's savings in such a scenario) Interestingly, this is almost identical to what transactions currently cost, in terms of inflation. IMO this says a lot about how Bitcoin is used primarily as an investment, rather than as a way to pay people over the internet...
What's good about such a scenario is it's guaranteed that nearly all the money going to transaction fees will go directly to the hashing power that keeps the network secure, and it's guaranteed that mining will be something you can do anonymously and Bitcoin stays decentralized, at the core anyway. You'd need a lot of off-chain stuff, or alt-coins or who knows what else, for low-value transactions, but it's not a model that much different than what people do today. (look at how most Bitcoin users trust central services like blockchain.info and coinbase with their funds %100) If markets demand it, you can get pretty good auditing and fraud prevention and punishment. It's a pretty safe option, but it's not particularly sexy. It's also an option that happens by default: inputs.io, coinbase and others have already popped up with their various solutions and it appears that majority of Bitcoin transactions already happen off-chain anyway. (the figures inputs.io gave me alone a few months ago for example was nearly 50:50 by value, and a clear majority in terms of number of transactions)
One problem with off-chain stuff is it's easy for it to become too good: if the market finds the centralized and decentralized ways of doing them prove secure enough, that'll undercut mining income by shifting more and more transactions off the blockchain entirely."

Not really.  The WU site is very clear for the sender.  If you want to send $400 you will have to pay $400 plus fees.  The receiver gets $400.  This is unlike bitcoin where all the conversion costs including the time it takes to explain how to cash out bitcoin are hidden.  Due to the price volatility, until you actually get money in your bank account or from an ATM/localbitcoin trader, it is impossible to know how much bitcoin in dollars the receiver is getting.

'While from a philosophical viewpoint, some people may argue that a system based on a central bank with the authority to influence money supply is not ideal, it does not automatically mean that a superior alternative is to have money supply set by an algorithm, as in decentralised Virtual Currency schemes.

Thank you for the video.  I find myself in agreement with a lot of what you said (maybe not the $100,000 per btc part), but I am not sure the miners will ever allow Bitcoin to be forked to something that doesn't benefit them.  
As for DPOS, there are several attacks that are possible.  It is possible for the delegates to collude in much the same way as miners can collude in Bitcoin.  I think their power is even more limited than in bitcoin as they could only block transactions, but 51% of delegates could effectively hold the network to ransom until it hardforked to a new set of delegates.  There might be opportunity in doing this if the network was the size of Bitcoin and a hard fork would be extremely disruptive.

There are 3 protocols that I believe hold the most promise for popularising a distributed ledger.  They are Bitcoin, Ripple and Hyperledger.  A lot of people  think they know about Ripple and all I will say is that it seems to be gaining mind share, but Hyperledger is still relatively new.
Hyperledger is pure ledger, it has no token and can be used represent anything - shares, reward points, currency etc. By un-bundling a currency from the distributed ledger it also unbundles the hideous political ideologies surrounding Bitcoin.  It is fast, there is no volatility, there is no early adopter advantage.  It is just technology.

Many corporations are overly obsessed with the disruption by new entrants.  They saw what Google and Apple did to Microsoft or what Apple did to the music industry and they worry.

I am quite impressed by BitPesa, but you still have to factor in the costs of acquiring bitcoin in the first place.  Western Union also offers conversion direct to M-PESA and if they want could undercut BitPesa, but competition is usually a good thing at least for the customers. 
Western Union fees also vary quite a bit depending on how much you are sending.  At £100 the fee is 5% for M-PESA transfers. At £1000 it is 2.5%.  Paying to one of their outlets though is the cheaper option I think.

Visa spend hundreds of millions of dollars sponsoring sports events such as the Olympics, FIFA, NFL, Kentucky Derby, NASCAR and MLS. They do this because the payments industry is brutally competitive and sports advertising is a good, positive brand association with a large diverse audience. Bitcoin is desperately in need of some positive brand association to remind people that Bitcoin is more than a currency to buy drugs.  For Dogecoin it represented a very cheap way of gaining a lot of attention and bringing the community together.  If you agree that Dogecoin is more about having fun with an an experimental currency than getting rich it has been massively successful.

The tip bots only have a tenuous link to crypto currency as it is.  You could easilly set up a fiat tip bot, fund it in dollars, pay out in dollars and tip in dollars.  The only stipulation you would have to make is that you would have to have a miniumum of about $5 in your account before it pays out via paypal, bitcoin, Amazon vouchers, etc.  That's how most of those survey/opinion sites work that pay you a few cents per survey. Tipping in bits is a way of familiarising people with the concept of digital currencies.

Depends on where you live.  In the UK the following applies:
- When a customer tells their bank or building society they have made a mistake, it will take action within two working days.
- If a bank can't reclaim funds straight away – for instance, if the recipient disputes its return – it will investigate and customers will be told the outcome within 20 days.
- If funds can't be recovered, customers will be given clear and accurate information on the options available to them, which includes taking court action against the recipient.
- Banks and building societies will make sure their websites, apps and phone services are designed to reduce the risk of a customer making a mistake. This might involve extra warnings or asking customers to input details twice.
If that was a UK bank and if it was Bittylicious it probably was  - you were misadvised.

The fees you are paying in normal banking/card transactions go toward the development, security and upkeep of the network.  In bitcoin, development is largely unfunded and security (if you accept that 12 pool owners, who could potentially collude in any number of ways is secure) is paid for through inflation.  Currently this is about $30-$40 per transaction.

It is possible for Bitcoin to become part of the financial infrastructure or used in logistics and back end asset management systems without much direct consumer adoption, but in my view the marginal benefit of adoptiong bitcoin over a competing crypto solution is small in these use cases.  
If you want ordinary consumers to use Bitcoin and I think that is key if you want to preserve the value of the tokens, then you need to persuade them that there is a benefit. You have to create a brand that is inclusive and inspiring.  You have to differentiate the product and promote positive values.  Sponsorship of the Olympics and the World Cup and other idealistic, hope inspiring events helps protect Visa from any negative fallout from credit card fraud events or bad customer experiences.

Ok, without getting too boing, you are most likely experiencing an AVS error.  Your card does not support Address Verification which is what the merchant is using to verify that you are not committing fraud.  AVS is only used in the US, Canada and the UK, so it is understandable there may be issues. It can be bypassed, but the merchant may not want to and may not want to ship to your country.  There are many shops like Overstock and Newegg that don't officially support UK customers either regardless of my AVS supporting card.  AVS isn't a particularly great system and is being phased out now.  The new verification system that seems to be everywhere at the moment is called 3-D secure and requires you to enter a codeword at online checkouts.  A lot of this stuff is in transition and should eventually become internationally ubiquitous.

I think the constant need to refresh ASIC hardware is going to favor the companies that can profit quickly in the short term from each generation.  Without the ability to sell this hardware on to mining pools, this will most likely lead to specialization by 1 or 2 companies who can both manufacture and run mining equipment.  I would suggest you will be lucky with a duopoly emerging, but with no regulation could easily result in a singular company in charge.

The day it becomes economically feasible to mine the Moon for its gold and if I am still breathing I will sell some. However I consider it more likely that  before then bitcoin miners will struggle to make up in transaction fees what they will lose in block reward halvings and lobby to keep inflation ticking along at a steady rate. We have seen a few quiet suggestions even today that a central bank might be a good idea and most of the world already accepts that controlled inflation is a vital component of a healthy economy. It wouldn't be that hard to persuade a majority if bitcoin became more widely used.

It does seem that Proof of Work leads to centralisation of mining.  Mining companies that make a profit can invest in more hardware, which leads to greater  percentage of available profits.  This cycle continues and is exacerbated by block rewards halving until one company has an effective monopoly on mining and can prevent changes to the code which would be damaging to these profits.  I am not sure there is a solution to this currently.

For years we have been told we should put more money into pension funds, to save, save, save for retirement and yet these savings are continually eroded by fund manager's charges and bad, bad investments which the average saver has no say over. All over the western we now have a situation where people are going to have to live on less than they thought they would because the value of their pension has declined.

Apple Pay resolves a big source of fraud for card present transactions in the US.  The rollout of EMV will happen at a much slower pace than the Apple system and provides an immediate solution to worried merchants.  Secondly, it could provide a major boost to mobile payments.  Consumers to date have been reluctant to use mobile devices such as phones and tablets to make purchases online.  The use of Apple Pay should help increase online mobile payments and will again reduce the potential for card not present transaction fraud as card details do not have to be entered.  This is of major interest to the card companies.

I would counter this with the sad history of online poker in the US.  Following lobbying and party donations by the gaming industry in the UK, the Labour govenment of Tony Blair went out of their way to encourage online gambling.  This allowed a number of online poker sites to flourish and expand worldwide. In contrast the US industry was initially stifled by muddled rulings from the DOJ and later crippled by legislation which the established casino businesses had lobbyed for.  Despite some poker exemptions, online gambling is still difficult in the US.
If a few Nevada lobbyists can get a game loved by millions in the US banned, what do you think the combined forces of Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, Paypal and half the banks of America could do if they sought to get trading in bitcoin banned? Sure it would still exist, but at what cost. Getting the government on your side is in my opinion vital.

I had a Mondex card, an electronic purse in 95. The whole history is interesting, but the reason it ultimately failed was that loading a card with Mondex cash was inconvenient and offered no advantages to just using regular cash or cards.

There are lots of different ways to sell Bitcoin.  Many people choose Paypal over Visa at checkouts becasue it is easier and potentially safer than entering card details.  Bitcoin could compete on these grounds or maybe on the whole end to end control of your money.  You would have to do the market research and see what works.  In a few weeks you will see Apple's pitch on why you should use iWallet. Given their track record this will be all about the end to end customer experience - efficient, safe and reliable.  The whole payment market is very crowded, but Bitcoin does have some unique selling points that may prove competitive if people can be convinced to trust the token.

Aside from the fact Switzerland is not an EU member and the rules are irrelevant, I presume you made the transaction in Swiss Francs.  The rule you mention is to aide harmonisation in euro zone countries for euro transfers.  Most banks in the UK, an EU member and in the SEPA zone, allow almost instantaneous and free transfers within the UK, but usually charge for SEPA deposits.  They can do this because the money is deposited or sent in Pound Sterling.  If I were to use a Euro denominated foreign currency account in the UK I shouldn't have to pay a SEPA fee.  I am not sure about Switzerland, but if you make regular SEPA payments perhaps there is a euro denominated account that would be more suitable.

Greece has around €4 billion in gold reserves and debts of over €300 billion.  In the event of a default the creditors would probably immediately seize what Greek assets were easily available to them which would include the 50% of Greek gold held abroad.  Under terms of the second bailout the EU would also have been entitled to the gold in the Bank of Greece, but I am not sure what the current bailout says about the gold.  In any case the gold wouldn't be sufficient to allow them to borrow again and the currency would be worthless whether gold backed or crypto issued.

Relational databases are a poor choice for a globally distributed, disaster proof data store with concurrent write access.  It can be done, but it is round pegs, square holes.

A share is a unit of ownership in a company.  They have most likely used your money for expansion and investment and you are now entitled to a share in the profits.  You can't hoard shares, but you can hoard commodities like oil and gold and you can hoard physical cash and bonds.  Investors usually do this to try to push the price up or in the case of bonds due to regulatory pressures. The term hoarding is the correct one for bitcoin.

Good luck to them, but I guess my question to Align is why do they need to use Bitcoin.

A private intranet that can be accessed by all major financial institutions, but not the general public would be quite a powerful and useful resource.  A few decades ago when I worked in the legal sector and long before there were so many courier companies, a group of law firms got together and setup a private delivery network as an alternative to the strike affected Royal Mail.  It proved very successful as it was cheaper, faster and more accountable than the pubic service.  It didn't need the scale to send a letter to the Outer Hebrides for 20p, it just needed to be able to route a contract to another big law firm by a guaranteed time. 
We are still very much in the experimental stage of crypto in my opinion and competition is vital.  I would agree that having a public project is also essential, but it's not like there is a huge amount of protocol development going on. A small development team can easily copy the useful bits to private projects.

You could use a single distributed database which would have a number of advantages, speed being the most obvious, but this approach whilst being effective nationally may not be the most effective internationally where we have to trust multiple banks and financial institutions in multiple jurisdictions resulting in many messages going back and forth and a number of delays.   A blockchain has the kind of verifiability which is tricky to achieve with a conventional database architecture resulting in less confirmation messages and an easier integration process for downstream FIs.

In what world do you live where you think it is likely that a company will mine 100 tonnes of gold from a passing asteroid and fly back in time for tea before dumping the lot on the market?  Unlike Bitcoin gold supply is regulated by the market.  If price falls mining operations slow down, if prices rise mining operations increase supply.  The enormous cost of production for 1oz of moon gold even assuming that you were also mining the regolith for helium 3 or other precious metals would suggest prices would have to rise dramatically to justify the investment.

If Bitcoin is the best blockchain for an Internet of Things project or asset management or any other thing that Intel might be interested in then you have nothing to worry about, but Bitcoin doesn't get to be the biggest just by being first and it shouldn't be shoehorned in where it doesn't fit.

It is unfortunate we have no historical evidence for what happens when economies are backed by a gold like commodity such as gold or silver.  It is such a shame we do not know what effects large external shocks such as the the first world war and the great depression would have on such an economy.  Darn those lazy historians and economists for not writing any books about it.

Online banking fraud increased from £40.9m to £60.4m in 2014, a 48 per cent rise. The number of confirmed online banking fraud loss incidents was 53,192, a number which is relatively modest considering the Office of National Statistics reports that 53 per cent of UK adults now use online banking, which equates to 26.9m people. Telephone banking fraud losses rose 20 per cent to £13.9m in 2014.

It wouldn't necessarily be costly and a traditional database lacks the public verifiability which makes setting up a settlement system like this costly.  You have to run a lot of messages back and forth at each stage, payment instructions are submitted individually, and the paying bank is debited and the receiving bank is credited before the instruction continues on to the receiving bank.  A blockchain may speed this up and there is really no need for bitcoin.

One of the slightly unsavoury aspects of Faster Payments is that it is run by its big founding bank members.  A smaller bank like Virgin has to abide by the rules which may include various unwritten rules on what to do about competing payment systems such as Bitcoin.

How do you think banks can make money from bitcoin?  Can they charge fees to transact it?  If they can't make money what is the incentive for them to encourage usage?   
It's really a moot point anyway. Until Bitcoin can handle 100s transactions per second (not just in theory) and development becomes more professional it is hard to take it seriously as a potential ACH solution.

Soonish.  The banks will now push back with their own analysis on how digital money undermines bank stability and liquidity by aiding capital flight.  They will delay until more stringent AML is in place and the BSI standard is finalised or they can shed themselves of all that nasty regulation. 
There were some beautifully grouchy quotes in the British Bankers Association report yesterday.
'it is not unreasonable to argue that the banks are encumbered by a raft of regulation that non-banks can avoid – be it capital ratios, funding requirements, liquidity, anti-money laundering regulations etc. To extend the￼ Peter Sands’ analogy, medieval knights gave up their bulky armour when they realised it no longer gave them protection against bullets, preferring the flexibility accorded by lighter clothing. For banks regulation could well represent the armour making it difficult for them to respond to the more agile digital non-bank competitors.'
'Bitcoin users can handle many of their daily payments needs themselves, without the need for interaction with banks, and avoiding the need to incur bank fees. In the same way, value stored in PayPal accounts moves outside of the bank’s payment systems, depriving banks of valuable
payments revenue.'

You are right, but I am not quite sure why this is a problem.  Ripple Labs are trying to make money which they can use to grow.  You only need a small fraction of a ripple for a transaction and the tokens are largely there to finance Ripple Labs as well as acting as a bridge currency.  They have repeatedly stated that you shouldn't be 'investing' in ripples, but if people want to trade it or hold it with the knowledge that the value my fluctuate dramatically I think that is reasonable.
