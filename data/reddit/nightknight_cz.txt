Well, he told me that he might find out too late, when BTC is worth 0. He really knows nothing about it, he was just curious about it 6 years ago, bought it for fun (his family is rich) and forgot about it.
He told me himself that he will sent me some, he doesnt care much, for last two weeks he was just partying, buying cars and wasting time with girls...

We met through PUBG, played for 2 months, later this December i started to talk about Bitcoin, that if somebody bought around 2011, they are now billionaires.
He sayed " WHAT?... WAIT WHAT? I think i bought some hundreds in 2011-2012, but many of them bought pizzas with"
Next day he found out about his old BTC adress and thanked me, sold 85% and got around 2.050.000 euros and left 29btc on his adress and said that he will sent me 0.5BTC.

So if I want to make biggest profit and likes my Altcoins
I should sell of BTC for example around 15-20k$$$
and then HODL only Altcoins
or If BTC goes wayy beyond 20,30,40k$$$ is better to SELL THEN to Altcoins
