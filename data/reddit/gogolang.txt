The borrow rate is probably going to be really high, which is going to mean a huge bid-ask spread on the futures, so shorting bitcoin may not be profitable even if it goes down a lot.

Yes. Got 0.01 BTC in 2013 and it’s not enough to cash out but enough to see the wild ride everyday

It’s enforceable when you sell for fiat. Right now unenforceable when you use crypto to buy something physical. If they’re making this change, expect additional legislation.

Depends on the amount of cash paid. If they withdraw more than $10k from their bank, they have to tell their bank what they’re using the funds for and that’s reported back to the government. 
If they pay you in cash from under their mattress, you might be able to get away with that. If that happens often enough, don’t be surprised if there are sting operations to pay cash for unreported bitcoin and arrest you when you come to collect. 
Also, would anyone feel safe showing up with a suitcase full of cash to buy bitcoin? For that matter, would you be ok showing up with your private key to a location where someone promises a suitcase full of cash for your bitcoin?
Look, I totally get it. We like to think that decentralized means that it’s beyond the reach of the government. The reality is that so long as you are under the jurisdiction and reach of the government, there are ways to enforce laws regarding your cryptocurrency if there’s enough political will.

This is inevitable. It’s a logical inconsistency that AML laws apply to bank accounts but not to cryptocurrency. 
If cryptocurrency is to be widely accepted, it’s going to start being regulated in the same way that fiat currency is regulated.

I imagine that it’ll be like it is right now with foreign bank accounts. You report it to the IRS on your tax return. To not do so will be a crime. 


@_date: 2017-12-02 04:18:25
Exactly. And there are actually a lot of means of enforcement. Even though they won’t catch you 100% of the time, few people will take the risk of going to jail.

Let’s say you receive a large influx of fiat currency to your bank account, it’s reported to the IRS. That’s one of the factors that will trigger and audit and you’ll have to prove the source of that money. If you admit that it was sale of bitcoin and you haven’t submitted your forms to register your bitcoin accounts, you’re probably going to jail. 
It’s possible that you could profit from bitcoin without converting to fiat currency. One day you might be able to buy a Ferrari with your bitcoin directly. In that case, there’s no good mechanism for the government to catch you right now. Expect additional legislation in the future to require merchants to verify the legality of bitcoin accounts that make payments that exceed certain thresholds.

You can argue with the fundamental basis behind AML laws but it doesn’t make sense for them to be inconsistently applied to different currencies. 
It’s not that hard right now to get people to admit to foreign bank accounts. It’s a crime to conceal it and you’d rather have the ability to use your money legally than risk going to jail. So yes, the IRS will have a lot of luck getting people to report their crypto accounts.

This isn't some run of the mill transaction.

Also unless you’re storing cash under your mattress, saving in fiat is not the same as saving Bitcoin. Savings in a bank are lent out and continue to circulate.

Ah. This explains why I received 0.00000001 BTC the other day.
