While I don't have any tips to help you advance your journalistic career, I would like to help your author career.  I own the site bitbybitbooks.com which is a site that allows you to write and sell books for bitcoin.  Perhaps that would be of interest to you.

That's an interesting point, but if you grab the source code from github, review it, and host it on your server, you've eliminated their ability to tamper with it and steal your bitcoin.  Unless you get hacked.
Nevertheless you make a great point about the need to be cautious. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 12:38:00
I know there are differing opinions around pricing based on fiat or bitcoin, but it looks like you chose to price in btc and did not account for fluctuating value. A project could have been created when the value of 1 btc = $100 usd but now that 1 btc is going for ~$500 the pledges and reward values are skewed.
If that isn't correct, people are asking too much for their projects/rewards.
Good luck, I sincerely hope you find a way to drive traffic and attract interesting projects.
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:18:56
I agree.  Using bitcoin needs to feel familiar and be simple.  Here's how I tried to bring average Joe into the bitcoin economy...
Because I own a publishing company and am interested in self-publishing trends I created the website [BitByBitBooks.com]( which is a writing community that also allows you buy and sell your books.  We *only* accept bitcoin, but we integrate it into the site very deeply.  
For example...
* when you sign-up on our site, we explain that you need a bitcoin wallet and then offer to set it up for them.
* you can see the balance of your wallet in USD (working on internationalization now), not in bitcoin because avgerage Joe doesn't want to convert 0.002487btc to dollars.
* you can add money to your account
* we explain they benefit from bitcoin because they keep more of the revenue 
* we explain that we pay them *instantly* thanks to bitcoin (authors typically wait until the 15th of the following month to get paid after they reach a payment threshold)
They never have to leave our site for bitcoin related activities, our users never have to leave our site to create a wallet, check their balance, or add money to their account.  Basically I've create a community for people eager to try new things to sell their work and transitioned them into a bitcoin economy.  For full disclosure, I'd say about half of our user base were already bitcoiners and the other half was new to bitcoin.

I agree that people need to have a way to earn bitcoin.  About a month ago I submitted this very idea to coindesk with some links to places where people get paid in bitcoin.
Trying to be part of the solution and because it's something I am interested in, I've recently launched a website, [BitByBitBooks.com]( that sells ebooks for bitcoin.  The site is designed to be a writing community that sells books, not just a bookstore.  We're getting about 250 monthly visitors and have a handful of authors.  Lots of room to grow and still fighting for traction.
I think it will be interesting to see what happens with BitPay's Wages API.  I think it's adoption will show if people want to be paid in bitcoin or not.
@_date: 2014-08-08 16:31:47
Thats really interesting.  Because it uses bitcoin, I wonder if you could use the blockchain to identifiy which wallet it came from, blacklist them, and then publicly shame that persons profile on BTCJam.
@_date: 2014-05-14 12:23:29
I think this is a chicken and egg problem and most people think that if merchants accept bitcoin everyone will want to get bitcoins and spend them.  This article says while merchants are needed, at this point it's more important to get bitcoins into the hands of more people.  Once people have bitcoins, they will look for places to spend them.
@_date: 2014-08-20 15:05:51
It can always be written on [BitByBitBooks.com]( too.  The site uses TinyMCE so writing takes no special formatting or parsing.

@_date: 2014-08-28 12:43:48
Not surprised.  People may know what it is, but they are scared to purchase it and jeopardize their bank accounts, and not interested enough to mine it.
There needs to be a good way to earn bitcoin without risk of loss.  If paypal offered to send money received as fiat to your bank account OR as bitcoin to your wallet, I think a lot of people would try bitcoin.
At least these are my thoughts and what I am trying to accomplish with BitByBitBooks.com. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:42:10
This is a pretty cool idea!
@_date: 2014-11-28 12:32:38
It sounds like you have a pretty good setup on github/leanpub but just to let you know about another option, bitbybitbooks.com is a site that you can write by the chapter and sell the chapters as you finish them. That way chapter 2 sales can fund chapter 3 etc.  Plus they only use bitcoin, no PayPal no credit card, just bitcoin. 
Just letting you know its put there.  Good luck with tour book.  It sounds pretty good.  I like the way you are presenting the market information and technology.  It sounds really well rounded.

Thats true, but it looks like it comes with HIGH FEES from your credit card company.  At least, this is how I interpreted their terms &amp; conditions when looking into instant buys.
"Credit Card Agreement
You must agree to the following terms:
    Credit cards are a backup payment method only and cannot be used to buy bitcoin directly.
    An additional fee of 3.1% + $0.18 will be applied to any charges made to your cards.
    An additional "cash advance"/ATM fee may be applied by your bank, depending on your agreement with them."
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:57:43
 Signing up on the site doesn't automatically sign you up for a coinbase account. The user is informed that they need a coinbase account and are offered to have it set up automatically, on your own, or do it later. There are several places on the site that mention needing a coinbase account and in the FAQ I explain why coinbase.
 As for what is stored in my database, I store the bare minimum, only what is required by the coinbase API and I employ up to date security measures and encryption all hosted and transmitted over secure http.
User are too smart to do anything secret to them. Make everything clear and obvious.  Trust requires transparency and without user trust you will fail.
Thanks for asking me your questions.  If you have any others please feel free to ask.  Good luck!

[BitByBitBooks.com]( is trying to take advantage of micropayments.  Full disclosure, it is my website, but I'm not trying to sell anything, just sharing information.
I am a self-published children's book author (side job - day job -&gt; developer).  It takes forever to get paid.  There is a payment threshold that has to be reached, then you need to wait until the 15th of the next month to get paid.  Around November 2013 I realized that bitcoin could provide authors instant royalty payments.  So I started working on a writing community &amp; book store that accepts bitcoin, BitByBitBooks.com.
We take advantage of micropayments by selling books in full and by the chapter.  I know by the chapter sounds odd but there are good reasons to do it...at least I think so, anyway...
So you can buy a $0.10 chapter (average chapter price) or a $10 book.  Either way, the author is immediately paid his/her portion of the sale.
Like other people mentioned, we too use coinbase to minimize fees.  I also decided to use coinbase because their API and services make it really easy to get new bitcoin users set up.  BitByBitBooks.com is set up so you can create a coinbase account, add money, etc. all without leaving our site.  
Anyway, that is one way we are trying to advance bitcoin and take advantage of micropayments.

I'm guessing that you cant.  Bitcoin, in the US is considered property.  So in the eyes of the IRS/Feds you are bartering your beer and the rules for bartering is that in the eyes of the IRS/Feds, the object you accepted for your beer has a USD value and therefore equivalent to USD at the time of the transaction.
That all being said, I'm no lawyer or expert in anyway, I do run a business that accepts bitcoin and this is how we handle it.  Good luck!

I agree.  I'm the owner of BitByBitBooks.com and we pay our authors in bitcoin and encourage them to spend them not convert them, although we do let them know it's possible to just cash out.
I think people may be nervous to buy in but may be more willing to sell something they already have (ebooks in our case) for bitcoin.  That way they really won't "loose" anything if "the bitcoin bubble bursts".  ...Some of our authors are new to bitcoin and a little scared...

Bitcoin is fast and cheap but converting fiat to bitcoin is not depending on your country and exchange.
On Friday when you get your bitcoin you can see how fast and cheap it is when you buy something.
In fact, I've read some articles about how bitcoin's fast &amp; inexpensive nature will change the way people get paid.  For example, if being paid in bitcoin, a developer could get paid per bug he fixes at the time of code verification or check in.  It's an interesting possibility. ...anyway, I think I got sidetracked.  Sorry.

I'm not 100% sure about this but based on a few conversations I've had with Bitreserve even though you put bitcoin on your GBP card it's still just bitcoin.

Idk.  I guess if you look at the buying power of 700 bits.  Two days ago I could buy a can of soda with it, today that may not be true. 
So then someone may be less likely to convert their fiat to bitcoin.

Not arguing but asking to be educated, what does it mean to "run a full node" and how does it help?
@_date: 2015-07-01 12:54:08
Nope.  I'm worried about people not being paid in Bitcoin.  If they don't have it to spend then there's no reason for a merchant to accept it because not many people have it burning a hole in their pocket.
The problem is people don't want to be paid in Bitcoin because they can't use it to pay for everything the way you can with cash our credit card.  I think the solution is we need more services that pay people for their hobbies or alternative revenue streams in Bitcoin.
For example I can't be paid only in Bitcoin because I can't pay my mortgage with it.  I write children's books on the side.  I make a little each month from it.  I can get paid for that in Bitcoin and if that revenue comes in I'm looking to spend those Bitcoin.  Note there's more demand to use Bitcoin and merchants we'll see the benefit of accepting it.
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:47:20
The site was designed in a way that integrates your coinbase wallet into the site.  That way you can check your balance so you know you can afford the book, buy more Bitcoin if you're low, and creates addresses for the chapters you write so you can get paid immediately.  The site is still trying to get traction but it's legit.

To add a bit of detail, install the mycelium or breadwallet app and use it to create a wallet.  It will tell you what the receive address is.  Then when someone wants to send you Bitcoin they can send it to your receive address.

You can send them to BitByBitBooks.com to spend their bits on ebooks.  the site doesn't list the prices in bits, but rather USD (currently working on localization).  Anyway the books can be purchased by the chapter.  Most books free but the not free chapters usually cost around $0.10.  Hope this helps.
