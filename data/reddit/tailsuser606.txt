Interesting comparison with Linux. What I see there is less of a common purpose of promoting Linux per se, but more of a fracturing of the community into groups promoting this or that distribution. Granted, one distro may be better for a server, another distro for desktops and yet another for embedded systems. I would hate to see this fracturing come to Bitcoin at the expense of the core philosophies and benefits.

I don't disagree with you, but recent posts have pointed out that just doing block size increases will quickly make running full nodes by small entities, e.g., individuals, economically impossible.

Yes, of course. Bitcoin's beauty is that it cannot be controlled. If that changes, the experiment has failed, IMHO.

If I support SegWit (which I do), does that suggest to you that I am supporting an interest group? I can see how that seems logical, but my support is for a technology implementation and the fact that others share my view seems coincidental rather than causal. My true allegiance is to what I perceive to be the core strengths of Bitcoin, among these being decentralization, immutability, fungibility (as a goal... I know we're not there), privacy (ditto) and security via strong cryptography. This is not an exhaustive list, but will do for discussion. I happen to believe that Bitcoin is best suited as a currency and store of value rather than a VISA-like payment network, and that those that are pursuing the latter as a goal have lost sight of what makes Bitcoin great in their pursuit of short-term narrow goals.

The rule for protecting your BTC is that you and ONLY you must have access to your private keys. I use paper wallets, printed from bitaddress.org on an offline computer. There are instructions elsewhere for doing this, but essentially, you download the bitaddress.org website to a thumb drive and then run that in a browser on a computer with no internet connection. You do this so as not to take the risk that there is spyware on that computer that might be looking for private keys to send to another person. What are the chances? Who knows, but who wants to take the chance? I am considering buying a hardware wallet (e.g., Trezor) but haven't taken that leap yet. A paper wallet, securely generated and securely protected physically is about as secure as you can get.

Who serves the broad vision? Users can (and do) get distracted by short-term profit motives, users can get fixated on Store of Value vs. Payment Network. Users can get focused on wallet ease-of-use. All of those are important, but IMHO the guiding principles above all else are not what users (or miners) WANT, but maintaining the decentralization, immutability and trustless nature of Bitcoin. Keep that top-of-mind and all other issues will find a way in or there will be good, principled reasons for keeping them out.

No analogy is perfect. I was thinking that PayPal has become it's own transaction marketplace, which can be spent in-market, or periodically settled to a more traditional account, such as CC or bank. It also hides the "traditional" account information from the other party in each transaction. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:09:36
I want to see the utility and adoption rise, and the value (expressed as price) will follow. SegWit accomplishes that. Letting miners call the shots for the goal of short-term value increase will be destructive to the decentralization principle that makes Bitcoin so attractive and revolutionary.

If you have the recovery seeds for your phone wallet(s) safely at home, just delete the wallet from your phone and re-install when you get home.

Agreed on all points. No hard feelings.

He only understands what "money" is as it applies to the current banking structure, which is co-dependent with governmental backing of fiat currency. He apparently has no idea of the nature of money at its core as a medium of exchange between trading partners, mindless of borders or central control.

I've heard that GDAX is better, but since it is owned by Coinbase, I fail to see how it could be.

With Bitcoin, your citizenship is never questioned, and your access to your money is under YOUR control, absolutely and irrevocably.

Yeah, but if you or I fork, it won't cause the major upheaval that is going on with S2X. Somebody must be able to call off "that chain which many exchanges will call S2X."

A case could be made that cryptocurrencies aren't actually on your phone! If you have your recovery seed memorized and no wallet in your posession, are you carrying crypto across a border?

Citation please? Not doubting, but I'd like to know the relevant statute.

HTC makes awesome phones. They also suck mightily at marketing, warranty repairs, and customer service.

Another possibility: People made wealthy from cryptos will be able to IGNORE politicians. We are seeing more and more how resistant Bitcoin is to external forces that would attempt to seize control.

I was concerned that the latest ETF setback would cause a price crash. But it seems like the Honey Badger really doesn't give a fuck.

Without government being in control of currency, government is forced by necessity to resume its rightful role as a servant of the populace, not the ruler. The inability of government to create currency or to seize currency will be transformational in ways we can't even comprehend.

So transactions waiting for confirmation could be seen as a market. A market in which you don't know the rules for how much you have to pay to get your TX confirmed without overpaying. It's anything but transparent. And good markets need transparency.

How hash values don't collide. And the unbelievable vastness and randomness of the bitcoin address space.
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:11:27
Yes to both questions. It would be prudent, though, to hold off making any transactions until after the dust settles. Even then, make absolutely certain which chain your wallet will be trading on if there is a chain split.
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:17:47
I truly wish I could understand this. Nonetheless, I am in awe of the power of math.
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:16:41
The impact is almost at the threshold of measurability. Also, recording bitcoin TX is only one application of blockchain technology. This is entirely within scope and in no way an abuse of resources. Go away.
@_date: 2017-05-13 18:34:59
Financial privacy as a concept in the US is a joke. The government pretty much demands information on every significant transaction. And whenever money changes hands, it is usually taxed. Bitcoin is currently considered property, not money, and falls under different tax regulations.

Do any of these other suggested mobile wallets support Trezor integration like Mycelium does?
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:25:43
Well, that's very disappointing, and I have emailed Mycelium developers to tell them so. Of course, they could give zero shits about me individually, since they're not making any revenue off of me.

This is very concerning, for bitmain to be actively attacking the BIP148 chain, while buying time, in essence, for their altchain to grow. How do the devs and BIP148 supporters think this attack can be defended against?

The guy who took over in February as a lead Android developer is posting on with weak apologies and saying he's not calling the shots. AFAIK, though, he will not disclose who IS calling the shots. Bitcoin users will see this move as the threat and annoyance that it is and Mycelium will take a hit as a result.
