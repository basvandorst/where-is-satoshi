Exactly.  I put in $100 when BTC was at $2500.  I saw it go up to about $850.  Now it's around $450.  It is exciting to see what happens day-to-day, and I can sleep at night.  And if I lose it all, I'm okay with that.
Cryptocurrencies is not investing.  It's gambling.   Don't put in more than you can lose.

@_date: 2018-01-17 12:18:07
Here's a factoid.   There are more than 1,400 crypocurrencies.  And in 2017 alone, 862 new cryptocurrencies were created.  
And my opinion.  Every mom-and-pop is creating their own cryptocurrency and is diluting out the market.   I don't think new "investors" will ever see the astronomical rise as the early adopters saw.

I plunked down $100 worth of BTC when it was $2500.  I've seen it as high as $850 and currently sitting at around $450.  The ride is fun.  But i would never buy more than I can lose.  If I lose it all, I'm okay with that.

The reality is that very few people will get very wealthy in crypto.  And those people are wealthy because they got in early.   People just getting in now will never get rich.  
I really do hope BTC has a future.  But when the day comes that it becomes a stable currency for the masses, you will no longer see its value double in a matter of months.   Imagine that you are going to buy a car for 4 BTC.   Then with the wild swings, it drops in value 25% the next day.  You go to purchase your car and they want 5 BTC.   It just isn't stable enough for everyday transactions.

Technically, if everyone bought and held, the piece would go nowhere.   Price fluctuations rely on trading.
@_date: 2019-11-26 15:28:28
You are wrong.   Bitcoin (and all other currency) is only worth what people are willing to pay for it.  If I have 1 BTC and you are willing to pay me $10K, then 1 BTC is worth $10K.  And then if you try to sell your bitcoin for $10,100 and someone pays you for it, the bitcoin is then worth $10,100.   If no one is trading and no mining is occurring,  price do not fluctuate.
You can buy and hold.  But others will trade and that affects how much your bitcoin is worth.  
And your comment "price will only go up".... you do know that no investment is guaranteed, don't you?

Reality is that anyone who bought early 2017 and earlier made some quick money.  Anyone who invests now will never see their money 5x or 10x in a matter of months.  We will be lucky to see BTC $10K by the end of the year.
On the other hand, my investments of fiat money in the stock market is positive for the year.   A few percentage, but still positive.

In actuality, being "boring, slow and steady" is really the only way Bitcoin can become a legit, mainstream currency.  
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:27:40
Coincidentally, I bought $100 worth of BTC when it was around $2000, because I had to pay for an online service.  The service was $25, so I just bought $100 just for shits-and-giggles.  That small purchase did see a 10x increase in less than 6 months.  
I have no interest in buying more BTC as an investment, nor do I think is a good investment.  They way i see it... If you follow the "don't invest more than you can afford to lose", that amount won't make much of an impact to your wealth.  The people that are "all in", could make a mint if BTC could drastically rise, but I think the risks greatly outweigh the rewards.
It's not a coincidence that in October 2017 when BTC took a big shit from their all-time high (~$20K) and big financial institutions started trading bitcoin ETFs at the same time.   These institutions make million-dollar single transactions which can affect the market much more than the Average Joe who buys $100 worth of BTC here-and-there.  


Obviously, BTC is worth what people are willing to pay for it, but BTC really has no intrinsic value.  It's not backed by any type of earnings or assets.

But seriously, if you have $10K of play money, you likely have a lot more and $100k is just a small portion of your wealth. 
If you only have $15K, profiting $100K is a lot. But with only $15K net worth, saying $10k is something you can afford to lose is plain foolish.

When bitcoin started its decline from 20K, it just so happens that it was the same time when large financial institutions started trading Bitcoin ETFs and also were able to short them on leverage.  This allowed them to move millions of dollars in and out of bitcoin. These large institutions have the ability to manipulate prices due to the large quantities they can purchase.  And they see it as a pump-and-dump.    If the large institutions didn't get into the game, I could see the price rising, but now, the big players buy, see a moderate rise, and cash out millions, causing the price to drop.

I personally think Bitcoin was the proof of concept for blockchain technology which has a very promising future.   I unfortunately don't think Bitcoin has a promising future.
What happens with Bitcoin theft?  There's no one that can or will help you recover them.  Local law enforcement isn't going to do shit.   It's still the wild west out there.
Disclaimer: I do own bitcoin.

I own bitcoin but not more than I can afford to lose.  I bought in at $2k.  I don’t expect it to reach $20k at any point this year.

I see Bitcoin as a collectable, much like artwork.  There's no intrinsic value in it.  The price is driven up by speculative interest.

I own bitcoin.  I bought in at $2500, so I'm still in the green.  I am not bullish on bitcoin, but I take a long position for the entertainment.

What currency did you use to buy your fedora?  I bet it wasn’t crypto.

I’m boring. I like index funds. 
I own about $200 worth of bitcoin just for shits and giggles.  If bitcoin turns to shitcoin, I’m cool with that.

Why not sell your entire holdings and just rebuy at 2.5K?  You would then own more than a full BTC.

I'm sure there will be plenty more of these "opportunities".

You know how many people said 6K is bottom?  Then 5K is bottom?  Then 4K is bottom?  And now you're saying 3K will never be touched?   We're only $500 away from it.
Edit: make that $384 away from it.
