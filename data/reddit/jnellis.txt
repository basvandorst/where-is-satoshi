Op is Canadian so maybe?  Those in the US should be very careful about doing this.  Batching transfers to stay under reporting requirements is a crime (structuring) even if the source of funds is completely legit.  I'm not a lawyer but I would at least make sure there is some form of plausible deniability.  Space out the transfers enough that you can claim you are dollar cost averaging or something.

Yes.  Most (all?) exchanges that allow you to purchase bitcoin with your local currency also allow you to sell bitcoin for your local currency.

The first $14k you receive in gifts from an individual in any given year is not taxed.  If the bitcoin gain value after you receive them, you will need to pay taxes on the gain when you sell.

Not to fear, they will ship when it is no longer profitable to use them anymore.  Same old story. When will people stop pre-ordering asic machines.

Depends on what you earn.  I often hear 15% mentioned as an "ideal" annual savings rate, if one starts from the very beginning.  
At the same time, 50% of people in the US have no savings.  The avg for people at retirement age is still less than two hundred thousand.  Even this amount is heavily skewed by the upper middle class and rich, and also includes home equity.  Wipe out the home equity and you're around $40k at retirement, on average.  The avg for someone who is about 40 is roughly $14,000 excluding home equity, $35k with home equity.

The IRS treats bitcoin as property, not a currency.  He could deduct mining costs assuming he has good records.  The rest of it would be subject to long term capital gains tax.

If we are working under the assumption 1 bitcoin will be worth $100k in the future, you would need to own 10 of them to hit a million dollars.  What are 10 bitcoin worth today, roughly $60,000?
