Update: Charlie Shrem confirmed that he will speak via Skype. 
I hope some other speakers confirm to be there in person though.

My gosh, are you guys totally unaware that hundreds or thousands of services use your API to may check balances and provide services on top of it?
What the hell are you guys doing. This guy is reporting a vulnerability for free and you act ignorant. Do you want somebody to exploit such vulns without reporting and blockchain ending up like emptygox?
How you actively prevent the community helping you:    
- A bug form with disclosure of the passport? wtf you guys do not want to get reports    
- A bug bounty nobody knows about
I really think you are a great guy - but telling the OP that he should use the bounty program (a month after he informed you) - sorry that was not very helpful, imo.
Thanks for disclosure and not exploiting it. Keep on helping to make the bitcoin technology and its services more secure - even if they are ignorant :)

Update 2: Also Peter Surda confirmed (in the shortest possible way) that he is speaking at the conference.
Looks like the conference is real but it has some blemish and lacks a bit of enthusiasm. But there is some time until it starts, so let's hope that it will be a great event.
