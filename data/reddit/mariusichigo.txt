@_date: 2015-12-10 06:49:31
2015-12-10 06:42 41 minutes Processing… 25.02709801 BTC 99 
Is this not right?

Oh. But I just found a block or something. Its processing my reward now. So at least its working? Is that good or not?
@_date: 2015-12-10 06:52:53
0.00000008 BTC in Reward, that was not great xD
@_date: 2015-12-10 06:55:27
So best would be spent about 1000 dollars on it and hope that 1 bitcoin will be worth 1000 dollars in ten years? hehe
@_date: 2015-12-10 06:52:19
Hmm, I was recommended this one but maybe it is?

Hansa as the guy from that YouTube channel ��?
@_date: 2015-12-10 06:40:15
But still 20 bitcon will be 4000 dollars right?
I just started mining and I am unsure if its working. I have a program and I registered on the mining.bitcoin.cz I then pasted the worker1 into the GUIMiner example: megamannotarealaccount.worker1 and for my password it is the password for my account at the page. 
It now says 13 accepted 150 Mhash/s
I have no idea how the wallet works though, do I just paste my link into it and it will transfer there?
If any of this is understandable thanks :)
I have free electical bill so this is no problem hehe

So you are saying the only way to get Bitcoins without going broke is to mine them? 400 bucks for 1 seems insane.
You cannot buy anything with Dogecoin? 
Thanks for the answer!

I’ll sell when we reach 100.000k
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:16:19
And if I restore it and someone sent funds from it that fuck me? hehe. But Won't a wallet.dat file be required when restoring?
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:04:21
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:32:14
Did you click try again when it failed the first time?
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:43:08
Okay but say that the coins are stored on a portable harddrive as the wallet.dat. And someone gets it from your pc and sends it to another address. Will you be able to restore them again from the portable harddrive?
