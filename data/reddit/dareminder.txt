Are you kidding me? Are you telling me with a straight face that blockstream employers have not made any pull requests to bitcoin core?


Bitcoin core among other things. Seems like you don't know much about bitcoin development.


Where is the contradiction? Apple is a company, iPhone is their product. Apple is not the product, just like blockstream is not the product. I can't believe I actually have to explain this to you.


Well, let's see. I answered every question you gave me. You didn't answer the following questions:
-what exactly are you calling an altcoin here?
-are you claiming that no one uses the products Blockstream creates?
So the answer to who is avoiding answering question is: you.

I use the metrics of adoption, hashing power and market cap. Many alternatives with bigger blocks have been tried. They didn't gain majority support.
Now it's your turn. What metrics are you using to make your claim?


Then write better code. It's pretty rich from you to demand that other people use their limited time to write code that you happen to demand on Reddit, while you don't write anything yourself.


Why would using a different crypto mean "giving up"? If you don't like what bitcoin is doing, use the competing products. Am I "giving up" if I buy an Android phone instead of an iPhone because I have started to like Android more?

Our policy is "we want to leave you alone to run your own life". Is that fallacious?


Give me an example on this. How do we libertarians play any favorites?


True, as anyone with a brain should be.


What? :D How did you jump to that conclusion from opposing corporate welfare?
Look around you. How many non-governmental monopolies are you aware of? The free market creates competition, not monopolies. If you are worried about monopolies, you should be worried about your government, which has real, violently enforced monopolies on many things like money, law, justice, police, taxation, education and border control.
I gave you several examples of 100% monopolies created by governments. Can you give me even a single example of a monopoly outside governments?

Okay, let's move it back towards op. Here's the thing:
-When the police pulls you over with a large amount of cash, they can just take it, no questions asked
-They would happily do the same with bitcoin, but they can't break encryption or even prove that you have bitcoins
If the police pulls you over, and they don't find cash on you, are they going to arrest you, interrogate you, threaten you with prison and go after your loved ones? No.
If the police pulls you over and they don't find bitcoins on you, are they going to arrest you, interrogate you, threaten you with prison and go after your loved ones? No.


Why should I be afraid if I haven't committed any crimes? I would be pissed, yes, but not afraid.
If I carry cash on the other hand, it doesn't matter if I committed any crimes. They will take it anyway, because they can. With encrypted bitcoins, they can't.

On 01/07/2013 M2 was $10.452 trillion. On 01/06/2014 M2 grew to $10.962 trillion. That’s a 4.9% increase in the monetary base in just one year.
That is the inflation number you should care about.


It's not a transparent process. Please read this Forbes article:

It's hovering between 5% and 10%, sometimes even crossing 10%.

Why would it matter? The point is that anyone who is not satisfied with the bitcoin project can invest in any of the altcoins. You can also try to fork bitcoin, but getting others to follow you is not going to be easy.

Is that so? In a libertarian society most people would have guns to protect themselves. Do you realize how hard it is to attack such a society from the outside? The Japanese knew this about United States when they stated during WW2:
"You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind each blade of grass."
You would likely get shot in a matter of minutes, once you entered someone's property with a pistol in your hand.


No, taxation is theft. In a free society we would buy such protection as a service from a company. Nobody will be forced to pay for anything, that's the whole point of voluntarism. But if you don't pay, you don't get the protection. Of course there will be companies competing on who's offering the best possible deal for the customers. In the current system there is no competition, only a monopoly.

Okay so we have established that you have no morals, you are a violent person who coerces others and you are a registered sex offender. You also don't care about society, but will root for the one who pays you the most. I think we have covered a lot of ground! 
Considering those facts about you, I understand why you have difficulties understanding the libertarian perspective. It's purely a moral case, just like ending slavery and condemning rape. Since you have no morals, you are unlikely to ever get it. And that's fine, I wish you all the best. 
If we libertarians ever get our own society, I will be happy to live there without people like you, just like you will be free to happily enjoy your statist, mass-surveilling, war-mongering, debt-slaving society without annoying libertarians like me. We both win!

Could you maybe tone down the hyperbole just a notch? I'm fully aware on the differences between monetary base inflation and price inflation, hence I specifically used the term "monetary base inflation". 
Economies are complex, yes, but the bottom line is that if all other factors stay the same and the amount of money is increased, prices go up. Do you deny that basic fact of economics? It's like pouring water in a soup. It can take a while before anyone notices or complains about it, hell some may even like it more, but the fact is that the soup has less and less nutrients the more you pour water in it.


Rallying against other inflationary currencies? Rallying after EU has been doing QE and the British are brexiting. What a miracle!


Funny, first the doctor was "a laughable joke" to you, but now suddenly he should be trusted? We both know that the algorithm was altered in a way that would display a smaller number for inflation. Can't let the sheeps see that the fed is way off it's own inflation targets.
The bottom line is that you think it's a good idea to trust the diagnosis of a doctor you yourself called "a laughable joke" while the doctor also has a clear monetary incentive to lie about the problem. Are you one of those people who don't think incentives matter?  You also dare to call BLS somehow independent when they get 100% of their funding from the government. There is an old saying "the one who pays the piper calls the tune". If you don't believe there is any conflict of interest there, I don't even know what to say.

I'm all in for testing different approaches when no use of force is involved. But let's think about our robot example a bit further:
Say we humans manage to build 10 billion robots. That's at least one robot for every single human. Now I have a robot, that can cook, clean, cut grass and do whatever chores I want it to do. Well, I will probably need that great helper doing those basic but important tasks, but are my desires now satisfied? No, I want to also paint my house, play with my kids, take the dog out, give me a massage, fix my bike and an endless amount of other things I need done. That means I will still be willing to pay for a human being to help me with those things, even if they are low-skill tasks. There won't simply be enough time and resources to build enough robots to satisfy the needs of all human beings. And if there would be, then wouldn't that be paradise?

I take it then that you don't actually know much about what happened in Ukraine.

But the shareholders in a company already risk huge amounts of their wealth. And their reputations. They can lose 100% of their investment if the company does something bad.

I already gave you the island example. Was there something wrong with it? I'm sure such a scenario has played out many times in history. Other good examples would be the early United States, when there was no taxes and the money was not debt based.


That's a copout answer. We both know you do believe in some things being better than others. For example, you seem to prefer regulation to free markets. Why?


Always? That's a pretty weird answer. There was not always a government. Did the government own the land even when it didn't exist?


Oh I'm fully confident that the government would escalate violent force towards me, just like any other mafia organization would in the same situation. By the way, do you endorse mafia organizations in general or just governments? Why?


So why don't you coerce people in your everyday life? Could it be because it's a terrible tactic for living a wealthy and peaceful life? Could it be that we humans choose peaceful cooperation over violent force, because violence is very wasteful and inefficient? Could it be that we choose win-win deals over win-lose deals because win-win produces more wealth for everyone?


 
Obama created more M1 money than ever before. Just take a look at this chart:
Is it a surprise to you that printing unprecedented amounts of money makes the stock markets go up? Now tell me, why was there a bubble in 2008? Most people seem to understand that it was created by the loose fed monetary policy. Well guess what, it has been three times looser since that. But no, this time there is no bubble. This time it's different!
Federal reserve is another great example of destructive governmental central planning. Since the Federal Reserve was created, there have been 18 distinct recessions or depressions: 1918, 1920, 1923, 1926, 1929, 1937, 1945, 1949, 1953, 1958, 1960, 1969, 1973, 1980, 1981, 1990, 2001, 2008.	


That's a pretty weird assumption. Kind of like assuming that a woman wants to be raped because she decided to go out to a club.


So what part exactly do you not understand from this very simple statement:
Social customs do not allow the use of violence against peacefully acting people. Government regulations do.

If they already see the accumulation of wealth as unnecessary, why do you need to wipe their savings every month?
It's in the human nature to accumulate wealth. We evolved to do that. Good luck with changing 100 000 years of evolution and the entire human nature with some new form of government. We humans compete for the best resources and for the best partners to mate with. You can never remove that desire from humans, the desire to outcompete your competitors, to get the best resources and to get the most beautiful partner possible.
Also, there are no "guaranteed" things in the economy. People need to be prepared against surprising events. They can do that by saving and accumulating wealth. Only a fool has no savings for the possibility of some disaster striking.

In other words of course free markets can exist, like the island example shows. To have a free market, you simply need a market which the government doesn't regulate. Like early bitcoin. The nature is not "regulating" us like governments are. You can remove all government regulations, but you can't remove facts of nature. I think it's unclear to you what we mean by government regulations.If I want you to wear pants when you do business with me, that's not regulation.

Nothing favors corporations more than big government that the corporations can then endlessly lobby for favorites. Nothing favors corporations more than extensive regulation that only an army of lawyers can tackle.
We libertarians oppose big governments and regulation. The reason we do that is that we believe in the non-aggression principle. Thou shalt not initiate force against peacefully acting people.
Taxation is the initiation of force against peacefully acting people and thus the goal of most libertarians is to end all taxation. If money needs to be collected, it should be on a voluntary/sharebased system and not forceful. You know, just like sex shouldn't be forceful but voluntary. I'm sure you are against rape. Well libertarians are also against economical rape.


Can you elaborate how libertarians favor anyone over anyone else? We simply say "I don't know how other peoples should live their lives and I don't want to control how other people live their lives as long as they don't harm others". That's what libertarianism is all about.
The good news for you is that I can guarantee your country will not embrace libertarianism any time soon. And if we libertarians one day manage to found our own society somewhere, you don't have to come there. We will be very happy to just leave you alone. It's a win-win for both of us.
Let me end by reminding you that there have been several examples in the world in which labor was very strongly favored and corporations were constantly punished. Communist China, Soviet Union, East Germany, North Korea and Venezuela for example. They all ended up in bloody disasters.

How do you know it's the majority? Core-supporters hold the majority of hashing power. So where is your evidence of big blockers being the majority?
Also, is bitcoin supposed to be a democracy? I hope not. It is a voluntary system, in which anyone can at any point leave for a better implementation. Seems like you want to make others (core) do something they don't want to do, without even paying them anything for it. Then you attack those who are at least willing to pay something for bitcoin development, while you still get to reap the benefits for free. Doesn't that bother you at all?

You have a weird superhuman view of governments. In reality they are constrained by limitations like time and resources. Why would they spend those valuable resources on a non-criminal with assets that are extremely difficult (and expensive) if not impossible to seize, when they can just grab cash and fiat with a flick of a finger. Game theory supports holding bitcoin in those situations.
You still haven't really explained how they can prove that I have knowledge about a certain amount of bitcoin private keys.

There will never be a post scarcity economy. Why? Because time, our most valuable resource, is always going to be scarce. We will never have enough time to do all the things we desire. That's why scarcity is built in to our universe as a constant.


Well will he or will he not get for free what the 99 people produced? If he gets it for free, then great, his needs are taken care of perfectly. If he doesn't get what the 99 people produced, then he can produce himself or group with others (who are also not being taken care of for free) and form an economy with them. He can feed himself. What's stopping him? Sounds like it would be really easy for him to do so if we as humans have reached such an amazing level of productivity.


That's what people have said since the industrial revolution. It will never happen. Human desires are infinite, but time and other resources are finite. Labor will always be in demand, it's just that the type of jobs will change. 90% of people used to work for agriculture. When that got automated, did it end the demand for the labor of all those people? Of course not, we just shifted our goals from basic survival to building more sophisticated things like greater architecture, making movies and games and so on. If we automate even more things, then we will shift our goals once again. Think space exploration and other possibilities like that.

Let me begin by acknowledging that you did not give an answer to my question.


No, of course not. I'm saying that the police, just like any monopolistic governmental agency, is not doing it's main job very well, which is not surprising considering their lack of competition and the twisted incentives.


The police doesn't care if your property got violated. They are too busy putting non-violent drug users to jail and pulling traffic stops. How many property crimes have you been the victim of? How many of those did the police solve?


That kind of language only weakens your case.


Okay, in that case please answer the following questions to find out if that's the case:
1. Do people respond to incentives?
2. Does a police unit get more or less resources if crime rates are going up?


Depends on the incentives.


Right, so will you work for free as long as you can excel in what you are doing? Or could it be that, while there may also be some additional incentives to go to work every single day, the financial incentive
is key, since the removal of that particular incentive would immediately cause you to terminate your employment.


No. But I think the types of crimes these cops should solve are determined by their higher ups, which in turn follow the incentives in the game.

"Capitalism; an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state."


Bullshit. Capitalism is what drives wages up, because it creates jobs and employers compete for labor. Governments drive wages down by destroying jobs with regulation.


No, that's the history of central banking. Don't mix it with capitalism.


They only take what is theirs by contract. A contract which both parties voluntarily signed.


The early US had the weakest state in the world, yet it was the most capitalistic society ever. I call bullshit.


Then you are pro-capitalism.


I agree, currently we have a fascistic, socialistic system with a lot of central planning. The opposite of capitalism.


You are throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Capitalism can't be anti property since it is the right to own property. It's not anti-wealth since it has created more wealth than any other system. And it's not anti-labor since it needs labor and allows everyone to have jobs. The only thing that is anti-labor is when government steps in and starts to regulate an demand licenses.


I hope you don't own any bitcoins. That should protect you from us awful bitcoiners.

Does it? The gist of your writing is the ridiculous assumption that women are so fragile that they can't handle evidence based gender predictions. What a terrible thing to think about women.
Also, this is obviously false:


You seem to mix assuming something with claiming something to be absolute. No one is saying "there are no female redditors". That would be speaking as if there is no possibility the poster could be female. When we simply make an educated guess about something, there are no absolutes involved. We humans are pattern recognizing creatures and it's rational to generalize. The ability to generalize things has been crucial to our survival.


And what if it's you who is alienating an entire gender, by assuming that women are so petty they can't handle evidence based gender predictions?
It's not wrong to predict a basketball player is going to be tall. And it's equally not wrong to predict that a bitcoin coder is going to be male. That doesn't mean there are zero short basketball players, and it doesn't mean there are zero female bitcoin coders. Again, we humans need the ability to recognize patterns and make predictions based on them. If you are spending your days fighting such behavior, then you are truly fighting windmills.

2. At Google, Hearn's job was to protect the internal network, which he famously left completely unencrypted, co-incidentally allowing the NSA to listen on all internal Google traffic by simple tapping. He then pretends to be surprised after Snowden leaked the NSA direct access into Google. 
3. Mike Hearn's first commit (5e650d6d2dbfc284c300668e71188e663d8f0a45) to Bitcoin caused a hard fork, the Bitcoin community was caught by complete surprise and the price dropped about 35% in a matter of minutes.

 &gt;If the world you're advocating for were more efficient than what we have now, we'd be living in (your proposed) world.
What a weird statement. Do you seriously believe the current state of the world is optimal and can't be improved in any way?


Yes, that's what you would have to do. And for that scenario I'll remind you of the quote about a barrel of a gun behind every grass blade. Good luck entering a country like that with violent intentions.


Here's the wikipedia definition of the word theft: "theft is the taking of another person's property without that person's permission or consent". I don't consent to taxation, thus it's theft.


I am an importer and entrepreneur.


Good luck finding those customers. I think it might be a bit difficult for someone with your qualities  and values.


Yes, that must be a very easy task when there is a barrel of a gun behind every blade of grass. How do you think people will let you enter their property if there is even a chance of you being violent?
You didn't answer many of my questions. You have claimed many times that you have no concept of morals or good and bad.

Because that's the rate your money is being debased at when it sits in a bank account. Some consumer products might indeed not become equally expensive, since there are constant improvements in production efficiency. But monetary base inflation let's you know the amount of value your money is losing, before any production factors come into play. So maybe a can of beans only went up 2%. But without monetary base inflation it would have actually went down 3%.


Do you deny the fact that they use the same method of calculating inflation that the government itself used during the 80's? Was the government a laughable joke that couldn't quantify their way out of a paper bag in the 80's?

Now the worst thing that could happen is that I decide that I won't let you in on my 99 people machine. Now your life is the same as today. If you are hungry today, you can feed yourself using your labor. Why would that be any harder if food production became billions of times cheaper and more efficient? It just doesn't make logical sense.
If the world can be fed with the labor of just 99 men, everyone on earth should celebrate and dance on the streets. All these other people can now move on to work on other things. Maybe space travel will really take off.

That money never entered the mainstream economy. It's sitting at the balance sheets of banks, waiting for the planned deflationary crunch, when they can buy half the world with that money.
Thomas Jefferson was well aware of this game when he said:
"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs."
The game is very simple. First you inflate like crazy and accumulate currency. Then you hit the breaks, let's deflation kick in and buy everything almost for nothing with your accumulated assets.
But that's not the point. The point was that of course inflation can always be achieved by central banks. Come on. You must realize that if the fed suddenly announced that the money everyone holds is now x 100 000 000, prices would go up because the economy would have to adjust. Would you sell your house to a homeless person for 100 000 000 dollars if the fed announced that a dollar has been turned into 100 000 000 dollars? Of course not, since as a smart person you would realize that someone is now going to pay much much more for that house.

Humans evolve. Slavery was common not that long ago. You could have made the exact same argument against a slave-free society.
Let me ask you these two questions so that our discussion can be more productive:
1. Do you believe that slavery was wrong and if so, why?
2. Do you believe that rape is wrong and if so, why?


So show me the law that recognizes a drug cartel as a corporation. The drug cartels themselves do not call themselves corporations.


Gangsters and cartels get funding only because the government has banned items that are in high demand. They both need governments to ban sought after goods to survive. If what the cartels and gangsters sold was legalized, then non-violent companies would out-compete them in a blink of an eye.


Seems like what you are saying boils down to this: Because there is a theoretical chance of extortion and racketeering in a free society, let's make sure we avoid that bý having a government extorting and racketeering.  Do you really not see the irony in that? Just look at the real world: the bigger and stronger the government is, the more corruption there is, because everyone wants to lobby the government for favorites. When the government is small, there is nothing to corrupt, no favors to ask. When the government grows big enough, then it almost always needs more and more power just to keep everyone under control. Those places end up like Venezuela. Switzerland on the other hand has a decentralized and tiny government. Do you think it's just blind chance that it is one of the most prosperous nations in the world?

What if I'm Bill Gates and I have just developed Windows. Then it turns out that I made a stupid programming mistake and the operating systems does some harm to some of the people that bought it. To make it extreme, let's say a plane crashes because of that bug. It's going to now be really scary for me, because what if the judge sympathizes with the plane crash victims and thinks it's only fair that I lose everything because of my mistake.

Deflation is never a real problem when you have central banks. They can just print insane amounts of money to ensure the economy stays inflationary.

The average person will never understand how ridicuous amounts of wealth is being stolen from them via inflation.
In the 70's people were speculating that our generation would only need to work a couple hours per week because of the giant predicted increases in productivity.

That's the part where I disagree. There can be non-monopolistic justice systems that are voluntary and not force based. A corporation could function fully under such a system. No use of force is thus required.


That's a really bad definition of the word, since you are basically describing an organization, not a corporation. But leftists never attack organizations, they always go against corporations specifically.


I'm happy with the definition you provided: "a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law."
Like I said, that definition does not include a state, since there can be law without a state.


State is the only reason why drug cartels are violent in the first place. Since the government has made them outlaws by banning drugs, they cannot solve their disputes in a court of law. If there was no war against drugs, the drug cartels would function like any other business: on a voluntary basis. And they would be very careful about their reputations in the eyes of their customers, like all businesses have to be. That's why no real business will use violence -it would simply be very very bad for business.

No. In a capitalist society voluntary actions replace the use of force.

Even if we knew to which address the money went by following the transactions on the blockchain, it's still impossible to recover the funds from that address.

Finland was a very right wing capitalist nation all the way until the 70's. That's when the wealth in this country was built. Many other countries around us embraced socialism together with the Soviet Union. We didn't and became prosperous. 
It's only after the social democrats and EU took a hold of this country that things have gone in a really really bad direction. At the moment, we are not that far away from what happened to Greece. Out debt is starting to have similar levels to what launched the crisis in there. That's because social democrats never actually have the money to pay for all the free stuff they want to bribe the voters with. So what they'll do is go heavily into debt. Yay debt slavery!

I don't have a problem with lowering taxes and having to shrink the government in the process. Taxes are the initiation of force against peacefully acting people and it's an immoral system.

Where do you need to apply? Grow some god damn vegetables or go fishing. What's stopping you? Your life will be a thousand times easier than it is now. If you can't figure out how to convert your labor into food under such circumstances then I don't even know what to say. People used to grow wheat without any machinery at all. They survived. Are you saying you are going to be worse off than people living a 500 years ago?


Guess what? This has already happened many times. Agriculture needed 90% of all labor. Now it needs 5%. Is there no more work to be performed in this world? If we humans get our basic needs met by automation, we will simply upgrade our needs. There will never be enough automation to meet all human desires. Let me know when every human being on the planet has their own space ship that can travel faster than the speed of light. 
We humans have been productive enough to guarantee basic survival for everyone for decades now. If you eat the cheapest possible foods and live in a tent, you can survive for $50/month. But guess what, people are not satisfied with that. They always want more. They want cars, televisions, iPhones, fancy restaurants, yachts, helicopters, personal movie theaters, summerhouses and so on. The list is endless because human desires are endless. But resources like time and raw materials are not endless. They are scarce.


Demonstrably false. Let's say we manage to build 10 billion super robots, one for each human being on the planet. Now I have a robot, that can cook, clean, cut grass and do whatever chores I want it to do. Well, I will probably need that great helper doing those basic but important tasks, but are my desires now satisfied? No, I want to also paint my house, play with my kids, take the dog out, give me a massage, fix my bike and an endless amount of other things I need done. That means I will still be willing to pay for a human being to help me with those things, even if they are low-skill tasks. There won't simply be enough time and resources to build enough robots to satisfy the needs of all human beings. And if there would be, then wouldn't that be paradise?

I think there will be a lot of competition and it will likely be driven by ideological reasons. Big banks will create their bankcoins and masses will happily use them. But people like me don't want to trust the banks, so we'll stick with bitcoin. Then there will be some people who don't find bitcoin anonymous enough. They will use something else. There will be Keynesians who are not happy with the properties of bitcoin. They will want a currency with more inflation. And there will be your onecoin-type of ponzi schemes designed to fool the ignorant for at least some time. Companies will have their own tokens/coins that can only be used for buying their services. Even local communities might have their own coins. 
We have seen from the Euro experiment that using one currency for countries in very different situations creates a lot of friction. Free markets do not tend to monopolize and I believe there will be competition. Just look at the endless list of altcoins at the moment. People buy altcoins in the hopes of them suddenly gaining value. That makes them gain value and it seems to stick for a surprisingly long time. Even dogecoin is still alive and well. I don't think people will stop trying to make some extra money with altcoins anytime in the future.

Seeking attention, while often a bit questionable, is not enough to discredit someone in my eyes.

But I still have also respect for Ver and Voorhees, because while they have different opinions, they have also displayed a good set of basic values.

So a bit like sovereign countries? If sovereign countries can have those things, why couldn't sovereign individuals have them? What's your theory for there not being any global world wars after WW2? Many people believe nuclear weapons created a so called balance of horror. Why could that not work on a smaller scale on an individual level: you don't dare to attack anyone, since it would mean your own destruction as well.


Hey, if you don't like that, in a free society you are free to not fund it. If I don't like my country spending money on bombs and guns, I'm still forced to pay for it.


Yes, let's conveniently forget about the whole stranded island example that I gave you and that you had to accept.
Also, you must have a pretty strange concept of property. I have never heard a definition of the word "property" that has anything to do with governments.


Again, by this same logic, we should thank slavery for all the technology we have. You never addressed that point.


And what happens when this pack of wolves decides to become the government? The same pack of wolves that you were so worried about, now has the monopoly on violence. And they use it. A lot. How many millions of people were murdered by their own governments? It's in the hundreds of millions.

Right so is you general belief then that monopolies and cartels tend to be a good thing for consumers?


Liberty is when no one is forcing you to make specific choices. You can make decisions voluntarily. That creates win-win situations by default. Fiat money will only work if it's mandated on the people via threats of violence. That's what you support if you don't root for freedom to choose your desired currency.


You still have that option with a deflationary currency. Do you think there was no borrowing during deflationary periods in world history? It's all a matter of contract.


Nothing magical about that. Capitalism is deflationary by nature. The productivity of humans increases 10% every year. Thus without central banks prices should go down close to that every year. How horrible to be 10% better off every year! What misery that would create! It would be terrifying to know that you will not only survive for the next five years, but your life will actually get more enjoyable as well. Stop the madness!

And that evidence would be what? Suppose they work together with an exchange. They know for a fact that I transferred coins from the exchange to wallet A. Then they monitor the blockchain and see that there was a transaction from wallet A to wallet B and from wallet B to wallet C. Do you think there is not now reasonable doubt that those coins have been transferred to someone else's control? Imagine if they started to go after everyone who was that point A in a chain of transactions. What a waste of time and resources and of course they would face a lot of lawsuits. Do you seriously suggest that they would start coercing all A points and threatening their families? Again, I hope that neither of us is living in North Korea. In my country the police has to have reasonable doubt of a serious crime to arrest someone. They can't just go after the loved one's of law abiding citizens. 
But let's say I wanted to avoid even being recognized as that point A. There are plenty of anonymous ways of getting bitcoins. I can work for them. I can buy them from an ATM. I can buy them from a friend etc.


 
Again, I don't live in some weird totalitarian country in which the police can go after your family. Did they arrest Ross Ulbricht's mom? Of course not, and Ross was made out to be this criminal mastermind so the case was certainly huge. They could maybe hold me for two weeks without evidence. I don't know why they would, since I haven't done anything criminal. But if millions were in question, then I think I could survive two weeks in a cell.

Maybe capitalism is kind of magical to you then. We humans learn. All the time. We become better and faster and more efficient at producing everything. All the time. That's why money that can't be endlessly printed sees an increase in it's purchasing power. There is nothing magical in the process. Currently our increases in productivity are being robbed from us by inflation and the poorest suffer the most, because they have no ways of hedging. 
A deflationary monetary system encourages saving. Saving is the opposite of consumption. If you are worried about over consumption and the environment, you should push hard for deflationary money.

Yes, it must be hard to make a profit when you know beforehand what the next stock market move will be. Janet Yellen says one word and the markets rally or crash.


Do you deny the fact that the fed is controlled by the leaders of private banks? There are no elected officials in the fed.


Your argumentation style is pretty lazy. I can't say I enjoy talking with you. Why don't you explain how I got it wrong? Are you claiming that the Fed does not set the interest rates (=price of money)? That would obviously be a ridiculous claim.


Yet it is you who makes claims like this without even the slightest reference to any arguments or facts or even logic. You just say "that's not how it works" and think you have contributed something? A true sign of ignorance.


Does it now? Are we humans un-learning things? Are we becoming worse in some areas of production? In what areas specifically?


So your argument relies on "not always"? That's pretty weak.


Global population is growing about 1% per year. Nowhere near the yearly increases in productivity.


Capitalism will weed out such production naturally because there is no profit to be made in such production.

Oh it's not my best thinking. It's what I use when I need to illustrate really simple things to people like you. It's quite handy as an example, since it keeps everything as simple as possible.


Based on your logic everything ever built was the result of slavery. Slaves raised the crops, that fed the people, who then made more people, who then eventually created government regulations and everything else that was ever built. Absolutely ridiculous logic.


So is rape. Doesn't make it moral.


When exactly did "they" start to own the land? When they used violence to take it from those who couldn't defend themselves?


Of course. I think you might have a weird definition of freedom. For something to be free, it simply needs to not be a subject of coercion. It's not something abstract and unachievable. The US used to be the most free country in the world and it became wildly succesful. Now that it has become a regulated nightmare, it's already on it's way out.


I don't see why this would have to automatically follow. Your arguments boils down to this type of logic: because we don't want to have a gang conquering us with violence, let's have a gang that rules us with violence (the government). It's like saying that to avoid raping, we should create a group of people who have the right to rape.


It seems like you don't understand the difference between social customs and regulations. I will give you a hint: only regulations will allow other people to use violence against peacefully acting people.

I mean, there is a small theoretical chance that my friend has started to date men instead of women. Isn't this exactly the type of ridiculous political correctness that you feel is crucial?

Bitcoin was always worth something. If not money, then time and effort and computer resources.
They could have sold their bitcoins at any point. They could have sold when it was at parity with dollar. Not selling was investing as well. They didn't even sell when it was $1000/bitcoin. That's investing too.


He is not forcing anyone to do anything. I have no problem with voluntary actions.


What a ridiculous statement. I can cut down some trees and build a house in a forest. Wealth has just been created. No social interaction was needed.


They have invested time and resources over and over again. I think it's more likely that you have added zero to this space, and that's why you don't have anything except your bitterness.


Having an immutable global open source ledger is zero sum? Got it.


We bitcoiners can sell at any point in time. That's the greatest defense mechanism there is. What is your defense mechanism against fiat inflation? Oh that's right, only the rich people can hedge.


We look to computer code to replace distorted information. Because that's all that money is, information. We simply want better information than what greedy politicians produce.

You say that bitcoin monetary theory favors those with previous wealth. But how does the current inflationary system not do exactly that? In the current system only those with real assets can protect themselves from inflation. With bitcoin, everyone would a little bit better off every year, not only the wealthiest.


Wow, could you define theft? Is there some use of force involved with the use of bitcoin? No. But try to see what happens if you create an alternative to the dollar. It's the current fiat system that involves theft, because only that system is backed by the use of violent force.


That's not theft.


No it's not, since the price reflects the utility. They are directly connected.


Taking risks early is a real reason. Without the early believers there would be no bitcoin.

You have pretty high standards if Trump doesn't qualify as a great businessman. Perhaps your own enterprise has been wildly more successful to warrant such a position?
Trumps net worth has been estimated to be 4-10 billion. He might have inherited something like 100 million from his father, but he has certainly multiplied that value 40-100 times. I think that is pretty successful, but again, maybe you can afford to have a higher standard.
 &gt;and would probably be more rich than he actually is now if he had never gone into business
Right, if he had absolutely perfect market knowledge and foresight, he might have made even more money. A bit like saying "if you simply bought bitcoins in 2010 instead of going to work everyday, you would have more money". A pretty lame argument, since no one knows the future.

Let's not even go there, you won't care anyway and I don't want to write a book.


Fine, let's do the source game then. Here are some quotes about the Fed:
If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs. – Thomas Jefferson
“I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.”– Thomas Jefferson
“The bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing.” William Paterson, founder of the Bank of England in 1694
“Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes the laws.” Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812), founder of the House of Rothschild.
“The few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profits or be so dependent upon its favours that there will be no opposition from that class, while on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending the tremendous advantage that capital derives from the system, will bear its burdens without complaint, and perhaps without even suspecting that the system is inimical to their interests.” -The Rothschild brothers of London writing to associates in New York, 1863.
Money is a new form of slavery, and distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal – that there is no human relation between master and slave.” Leo Tolstoy, Russian writer.
“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and money system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.” Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company.
“The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is, perhaps, the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banks can in fact inflate, mint and un-mint the modern ledger-entry currency.” Major L L B


Even in that area the yearly production is increasing. Chart:
So weak example.


Sure, let's talk about the computer market then. Are you saying the production of computers is not deflationary?


And these devices of course increase our productivity even further.


That's because there is a profit to be made in the production of weapons. Weapons help people achieve many different ends. Bad example.

No sure, I have no argument there. People might choose another fiat currency. Although many would probably be quite skeptical towards fiat so bitcoin might gain some new friends.
My point was simply that bitcoin is perfectly capable of replacing a fiat currency. Even though the bitcoin settlement layer is limited and relatively slow, faster systems like Visa and Mastercard can operate on top of it.

It's perfectly natural to want to save in a deflationary currency and spend the inflationary currency.
Of course this only works as long as merchants are happy to accept the inflationary currency. At some point you might not have the luxury to choose, because everyone wants only the deflationary currency.

I'm not sure if I understand what you are saying.
It's very easy for a central bank to stop deflation: just print huge amounts of money.
It's much harder to stop inflation: you would need to take money out of circulation. While there are some ways to do that, taking cash out of circulation is not a simple task.
@_date: 2016-04-06 10:07:16


Really? So are you saying that it's not the rich who can hedge against inflation with real assets then? Do you see a lot of poor people owning things real-estate, stocks and gold?

As a human being you might find that rather challenging. We need a lot of things in order to survive and be comfortable.


I'm not sure that I buy this logic. You should ask: what is the money that is invested really for? Well usually it is to buy goods and services in order to produce something, right? Now if there is less money on the market, then those goods and services will simply become cheaper. When they are very cheap, then developing new things will also be very cheap. The providers of goods and services will compete fiercely in order to get you to spend your precious money on their product, until the prices are low enough to make such investments even more tempting than simply holding your money idle.
@_date: 2016-04-23 19:56:45
There is. Bitcoin is similar to the gold standard; if financial institutions create too many "paper" bitcoins, there will be a bank run on them. Also, how could you possibly even stop Mastercard from creating bitcoin denominated credit cards? That's right, you can't. It's inevitable.

There is one crucial difference though: nobody forces you to use bitcoins at gunpoint.

@_date: 2016-04-23 19:16:24
Okay let me attempt an ELI5:
When banks print more money, the value of existing money tends to decrease. That's called inflation and it's what makes the prices go up every year.
A deflationary currency that can't be created at whims of a central banker, is on the other hand likely to see it's purchasing power go up year by year. That means that goods and services priced in that currency will become cheaper and cheaper.
This results in the desire to want to hold on to the deflationary currency, since holding it is rewarded by a increased purchasing power. If you hold on to an inflationary currency, you will be punished by a decrease in your purchasing power. That's why it's desirable for us to hold bitcoin and get rid of fiat by paying for things with it.

Irrelevant. My example simply shows you how the "you can always move" argument is ridiculous.


This quote from the District Attorney should be enough to show you the general attitude:
"A unique form of domestic terrorism" is the way the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, Anne M. Tompkins, is describing attempts "to undermine the legitimate currency of this country." The Justice Department press release quotes her as saying: "While these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of this country."
Terrorism. That's what they will call it.


Right, just like they shut down bittorrent by passing laws against piracy?


Again this lazy argumentation style. If I made an error, correct it. Specify the error. Otherwise it's hard to take you seriously. You seem more and more like a troll.


Then you agree that the government would use force against someone creating their own currency? Thank you for conceding the point.


Kind of hard, when you are not saying much more than "you are wrong". How should one respond to a non-argument like that?


I don't. I don't live there. But why should the options be limited to barter or leave?  Why do you support a government monopoly on money? If you support the separation of church and state, you should support the separation of money and state for the same reason.

Everyone has a some kind of a tax burden.

If a mafia gives you this same line when you refuse to pay a protection racket, does it mean it's all voluntary?


And the only reason for that is that it's decentralized. Just like bittorrent. Governments would love to shut both down, but they are not able to.


How convenient. You already understood the force involved regarding taxes. Now it seems like there is force also involved with anything gold related. I bet there are other areas with obscure laws that would land anyone trying to print their own currency in jail as well.

Have to disagree with just one thing: bitcoin is not a terrible name, it's actually pretty clever. Here are some things that it accomplishes:
1. It is reference to bittorrent, another decentralized system
2. It marries together something digital (bits) and something tangible (coins)
3. It's also a clever way of dissing paper money. Back in the day before central banks, coins were actually more valuable than paper notes. When we get rid of central banks via bitcoin, coins will be more valuable once again.

I don't claim that there are no economics of scale. I just don't think that plays a very large part here. There is first of all a cutoff after which the goods needed to make those burgers will no longer become cheaper no matter how large the quantity is. Secondly people will still need to eat regardless of the economic model, so there is no clear indicator that the number of mchickens sold would drop.
I'm sure you also recognize the basic economic law of supply and demand, which states that the more there is demand for something, the higher it's price is going to be if the supply stays the same. If there is a large global demand for the goods needed to produce mchickens, then it sets some pressure to rise the prices of those goods.

Thankfully? So being a career politician, planning how much to forcefully take from the productive class, is a bigger merit in your opinion than making voluntary win-win deals? Maybe you can expand a little bit on that view?


Yes, in hindsight. Also, if you have doing business in your blood, you are not going to be happy simply putting your money into a stock market. You want to build things. Which is what Donald does.

I went ahead and read the Wikipedia article. I don't think it merits calling him an unethical person. Yes he did some hacking as a young kid. Many people did. With Megaupload they were actively removing copyrighted materials, but just like Google can't remove all illegal material from Youtube, it's almost impossible for a upload service to find and remove everything illegal. Then there was the case where he pumped and dumped a stock. That's a bit greedy, but pretty typical human behavior. I simply don't see enough evidence to judge him as harshly as you do.

I need an easy solution for selling downloadable items for bitcoins. Something that could be copy pasted in the html of any website. I don't mind if the user has to then leave the website to complete the purchase. What is important for me is:
1. Easy copy paste integration of "buy now" buttons to any website
2. Easy to upload the items to be sold
3. I'm more than willing to pay a small cut from the selling price, ie. 1-3% 
If you could make those things happen, that would be awesome!

It's not an appeal to emotion. It's a simple fact. You can try to push it away from your mind, but the truth remains. You are advocating the use of violence and coercion against peacefully acting people.


Somalia is a failed socialist state. It's the result of socialism. And it does have a government. And they do use violence to rule over others. So I think Somalia fits your worldview more closely than mine.


Not an argument, just an insult. By the rules of debate, you have lost.


Read previous response. And please explain why exactly I'm naive? Because I don't think it's a good idea to give politicians the right to use violent force against peaceful people? This right has lead to the deaths of hundreds of millions of people, yet you believe it's a good thing to have. And then you have the nerve to call me naive?


The early centuries the US was the closest thing we have seen so far. It quickly became the richest country on earth.
We have plenty of examples of tight government control as well. Those usually end up with mass murder in the scale of millions.


That's like saying there was no point in debating slavery while you were living in a slave-based society.


If you think democracies around the world reflect what the majority wants then you are the naive one here. I have 100% solid proof that democracy doesn't work at all. Just see this study and it will crush your understanding of democracy:


Or I can use this non-violent form of convincing others that the use of violence against peacefully acting people is morally wrong. Once evil is exposed, it loses it's power.

Data, please? There is no such thing as "corruption" in a free market. You need politicians that have the power to redistribute massive amounts of everyone else's wealth to get corruption.


True only in the capitalistic Western Europe. Go visit Eastern Europe. Or even East Germany, still recovering from socialism.


 
In other words: because some humans are bad, let's create a group with special priviledges to use violence over others and then hope that magically the bad people won't be attracted by such positions of power. How naive of me to think that will not work very well. And it's not like these groups of people have slaughtered hundreds of millions. How many people have these scary companies that you are so afraid of slaughtered?
Show me one monopoly that is not enforced by governments? Just a single one please.


Companies by default can only exist if they do everything they can to serve the public. Happy clients are the only way they get funding. Compare that to governments, where they just take their funding by force, wihtout any accountability. Governments even get rewards from failure, just like Geroge W Bush got massive rewards and power gains for failing to protect the american people against terrorists.


Where have the conditions of the non-aggression principle ever been tried on a nation wide scale? 
What history has shown us though is that capitalism works: I recommend you do a little comparison in which you look at countries that embraced capitalism last century and compare the outcomes to socialist countries. I doubt you will challenge yourself like that though. You haven't said a thing about the win-win argument I have referred to several times. Perhaps you don't understand it?
At the end this all comes down to a very simple thing though:
You advocate using violent force against peacefully acting people, and that's just morally wrong. When people wanted to end slavery, the opponents said "but who will pick the cotton?". Well, that's the wrong question to ask. Slavery needed to end because it was morally wrong, regardless of who is going to end up picking the cotton. Saying we should use violence to ensure economic equality is exactly the same as advocating rape as a form of equalizing the mating game.

Governments don't provide you with anything. They steal money from everyone, and then pay usually private companies to do the actual productions. 


Oh you mean the same banks that were the largest campaign contributors to Obama? The same bankers that then received trillions of taxpayer money from Obama? Your example is the worst kind of crony capitalism/facism and has nothing to do with the free market. Of course the bankers gamble, when they know that if they lose the taxpayers foot the bill.


And I only brought it up because you made blanket statements about Europe. I had to point out that only the capitalistic part of Europe did well.


It doesn't fall apart at all. I imagine the first libertarian nations will probably be seasteads and it won't be millions at first. You don't gain anything by using aggression in a society that follows the non-aggression principle; you will get kicked out very quickly.


Capitalism is non-violent at it's very nature. We capitalist deal with money and trade instead of guns and violence. When was the last time a company threatened you with violence?


The so called "wild west" was actually a lot more peacefull than your average city these days.


No, you don't need to be for communism. It is enough that you bring in the gun of the government to intervene with voluntary negotiations. That is enough to turn win-win into win-lose or lose-lose.


No. A man working long days is not a "criminal threatening to undo society". But if he doesn't pay out his protection racket money, you are ready to use violent force against him. A kid smoking weed at weekends is not a "criminal threatening to undo society", but you support a system that kidnaps him and locks him up.


Oh come on. Government played an essential role in keeping slavery going. It helped catch runaway slaves and outlawed helping slaves. Wide scale slavery would never have been possible without a government.


Nice collection of words there. Unfortunately you did nothing to refute my analogy. If you support violent redistribution of wealth for the sake of equality, why do you not equally support violent redistribution of sex for the sake of equality? Could it be because your philosophy is really quite inconsistent?


Is Guantanamo Bay moral? Is torture mortal? Is mass spying moral? How would consensus be reached? Who would enact it? 


You obviously know nothing about either place. I have no interest in educating you about them, since those places do not interest me one bit. 


The capitalistic Finland was a great place to live. Nokia helped a lot. Not so anymore. World leader in suicides now. Public healthcare is a joke.

All this while we sell our unborn children to debt slavery to pay for it.

Really? Are you saying these socialist countries are famous for their non-existent levels of corruption:


I think it's naive to think that you can somehow stop lobbying and favoritism by passing laws. As long as you have politicians who can redistribute large amounts of wealth, you will always have corruption, lobbying and nepotism. It's very hard to get caught if you are careful enough. The solution is not to think that those things will vanish by writing a couple of laws. They will become meaningless only when we don't allow individuals to hold such redistribution power. Nobody is trying to lobby or corrupt me -because I don't have any money to redistribute.

You seem to be ok with having these overlords in place and proceed to call my ideas unrealistic? Now which one of us really has the naive picture of human nature?
The difference between you and me is that while we both want prosperity and peace, you are willing to use violence to achieve that.

I assume you mean free market capitalism with "pure capitalistic"? Which is just another way of saying that individuals are free to commit win-win exchanges without third parties preventing it violently. I wonder if you understand why win-win exchanges create wealth and why forced "exchanges" usually destroy it. Because if you do, then suggesting that we need less win-win and more win-lose or lose-lose becomes pretty weird. Also I think you are probably thinking about inequality in a different way than I am: which situation is more inequal in your opinion:
1. Person A makes only 0,50$/day and is almost starving to death while person B makes 5 $ and can eat as much as he needs everyday
2. Person A makes only 100$/day and thus can only occasionally make trips with yachts. Person A makes 5000$/day and thus can own a yacth. This allows him to make yacht trips every week. 
I don't know about you but I'd rather have type 2 inequality, even though it's a much larger gap in dollar terms. And type 2 inequality is what capitalism tends to give us, while type 1 equality results from socialism. In other words, socialism makes everyone equally poor.


That's right. You seem to think it's good to have special individuals (the government) who have the right to use violent force against everyone else. I do not believe so. It's a weird kind of "freedom" where 50-70% of what you earn is stolen from you each month based on a threat of violence, or where special groups of people are allowed to kidnap and lock up peacefully acting people who did no harm to anyone.


Then why do you support government monopolies on things like money, law and violence? It's a funny thing, but there are no monopolies in a free market. The only monopolies we actually see are a result of government force.


You seem to support positive rights. The problem with positive rights is that if I have a right to say healthcare, then you have the obligation to provide me with it. If just the two of us lived on an island, would you still believe you have the obligation to educate, feed and house me even if I prefer not to work at all? That should show you how absurd positive rights are. Negative rights work. We can both respect our rights to be free from violence without neither of us having to lift a finger.


I wasn't born with the looks of Brad Pitt. Do you think I should be subsidized because I don't have equal oppoturnity to mate with beautiful women because of that? I can't sing either. Should I get subsidies that allow me to make live performances so that I have equal oppoturnity in that area? Can't you see how ridiculous the whole notion of "equal" anything is?


I have considered it a great deal. In the matter of fact I used to think just like you. The thing is, companies don't scare me because I interact with them on a voluntary basis. It's ironic that you are so afraid of companies getting too much power that you are willing to grant the government absolute and ultimate violent power against everyone else. Do you really think it's the corporations we should fear? Last time I checked it's pretty rare that corporations mass murder people. Governments do it all the time. I think you fear the wrong thing. Why exactly are you comfortable giving a few people violent dominion over everyone else and expect them not to abuse that power? Do you think there is a working democracy that makes these people accountable? Because if you do, please look up a study with the words "Gilen's flatline". That should break the last illusions of having a "representative democracy".

Then I'm right there with you. People should be allowed to freely involve themselves in any collectives, including unions.

I agree that human nature is cabable of change.
But governments are by very definition entities that hold a monopoly on force in a certain geographic area. My question is, should anyone have such a monopoly on violence? Or should we evolve to a point where violence against peacefuly acting people is not a valid option anymore, just like rape is not a valid option when you want to have sex?
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:40:44


So no true scotsman? I used a default list from Wikipedia. What exactly is your definition of "socialism"?


US is far far away from free-market capitalism. How can there be free market capitalism when the lifeblood of economics (money) is in complete control of the elite?
I do believe we both root for similar things. I want to help the poor. I don't want huge wealth gaps between people. It's just I believe humans flourish in freedom and I think I have a lot of empirical evidence to back that view. It seems to be consistent that when we have two sets of similar people (East vs. West Germany, South vs. North Korea, Singapore vs China) the ones with the most freedom become wealthy. Do you disagree?
The reason is simple enough: free people create win-win interactions, which create wealth. When force is applied, we get more win-lose or lose-lose situations and wealth is destroyed.

I actually went to the link you provided. They claim that one reason for anarcho capitalism being impossible is that the price of protecting property gets very high when one accumulates large amounts of it. So what? That simply means that it's not economical for anyone to own too much property. Which is good (more even distribution). I really don't see where the problem is in that. I also didn't like the other arguments, but would you address this first.
Anarcho capitalists can also have public spaces, by which I mean spaces owned by a very large collective. I don't see a problem there.
Here's why I believe free market capitalism will win:
When two people make a voluntary trade, it's by default a win-win situation. Both parties wanted the thing they got in the trade more than the thing they gave away in the trade. These win-win situations are the reason why the living standards of human beings have improved so greatly during the triumph of capitalism. If you do not allow humans to trade freely, you stop them from creating win-win situations. That will of course not end nicely, as we have seen pretty much every single time when socialism has been tried.
Do you accept that a voluntary trade is by definition win-win? If you do (as I think you must) then would you still prefer to use violent statist force to stop people from trading with each other voluntarily?

Having resources available for less money is generally good for everyone. There might be some individuals who suffer in the transition of course. But the whole country in general has a net gain, because people can now use their extra money and time for other things.

You make reasonable points but let me counter anyway :)
I agree with you that political realities might pressure politicians to save the banks. I'm pretty sure banks are heavily involved in campaign contributions as well to make sure the bailouts keep coming. This goes to demonstrate that democracy is a flawed system. It should be strongly limited by a constitution, but we all know how much respect the US constitution gets these days. Bailing out private banks with tax payer money is completely against the spirit of the US constitution. To get out of this nasty situation which keeps on rewarding insane risk taking by the banks, the people should be told that there will be no more bailouts and that it's the responsibility of the individual to research the bank he will trust his money with. The current system is basically telling consumers they shouldn't perform any due diligence when it comes to their banks while telling bank managers they should aim for the highest risk/reward investments possible without any fear of negative consequences. In a nutshell, the incentives are completely twisted.
Free trade &amp; social impact:
I get your concern about how free trade will impact people and the society. I think where we might differ here is that I prefer letting the individuals make the plans for themselves, instead of some politician making the important life-affecting decisions of these individuals. I have never seen central planning producing better results than markets. Do you have examples of that happening?
Debt slavery:
You parents did probably not have to pay half of their income in taxes just so the government could pay the interests on the debt. This might await the future generations (realistically the system will probably collapse before that though). Inflation might eat away debt but it's not a very nice solution since it eats away purchasing power in equal amounts. In my view, inflation is basically robbing humanity out of the increases in productivity we create by getting better at producing everything. If the money supply would be stable, we would see prices drop all around us, because of our constant increases in production skills. That would mean our purchasing power growing in real terms, which is a key factor in what truly makes life better for people in all social classes.

Does it include the right to a television? How many inches? Led or plasma? How many square meters should your house have at a minimum? Does it include internet? How fast?
Of course none of that really matters, since we both know getting paid 0$ is far worse than getting paid 20$. And the people with low productivity will get paid 0$, since no business can operate at a loss for a long time.

I define capitalism as respect for property rights and voluntary trade. When two people make an exchange out of their free will, both are better off, since both wanted the resource that they received more than the resource they previously held. It's a win-win situation. I don't see what is morally unclear about that?

Being an employee is in itself an example of a voluntary win-win trade.


If the labor unions use violence to stop peaceful men from entering their workplace, then self defense is justified. It's not like the employees used violence to force someone to work for them. That part was always completely voluntary.


This is simply not true. No monopolies form in a free market, because it simply becomes too beneficial for the competition to enter the market. The only monopolies are the government backed ones. If you are against monopolies, you should be against governments, because they have monopolies on force, taxation, education, law and so on.

Is the mass media preparing us for deflation? It's the perfect play for the banksters; first you get everyone to get tons of cheap credit, then you slam in the deflation breaks and take their houses for very little cash.
Thomas Jefferson warned us about this:
"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs."
@_date: 2014-08-02 19:12:14
Sorry but in order to have a debate, you need to actually hold rational positions. You talk first about the workers owning the means of production and the you speak against private property. Clearly you have no idea of what you are talking about.
Good luck having a socialist society without rulers (which is what anarchism actually means). Socialism depends on redistribution of wealth and that will always be a violent process and thus requires rule by force.

If you have no house and manage to get the money to build one, I think it's an easy choice for most people. Deflation doesn't affect necessities of life. You won't hold off buying food because it might get cheaper next year.

There has been plenty of evidence that credit card companies don't like bitcoin (big surprise right). Therefore, if you sold someone a bitcoin with a credit card, they could issue a fraudulent chargeback and and probably win, therefore keeping both your bitcoin and their money.
In this system it seems to me that the credit card companies will never even know that bitcoin has been involved in some way. So let's say I want to buy a bitcoin. I use my credit card to buy an item, and this item gets shipped to the person selling me the bitcoin. It's easy to prove that the item has been shipped and collected and it's easy to prove that I have received the bitcoin. If I would try to initiate a fraudulent chargeback for this transaction, it would be easy to prove that the goods have shipped and I would probably lose the chargeback.
I think the greatest innovation here is the ability to buy bitcoins with credit cards without the credit card companies knowing I bought bitcoins. And all this in a decentralized manner!

Think of it this way:
-When a dollar is created, it has to be paid back with interest
-To pay the interest on the first dollar, another dollar must be created, which again must be paid back with interest
-That ends up in a situation, in which there will always be more debt than there is money.
-Bitcoins are not debt when they are created, so it avoids this scenario of ever growing debt. Thus perpetually growing debt is not a feature of the bitcoin system. Money can still be borrowed of course, but there is nothing wrong with that. What is wrong is a system that was designed to eventually collapse.

What do you mean with "you can't live"? I'm pretty sure you can eat pretty well with 20$/day. In many countries people survive with less than a dollar per day. Are you seriously saying that 20$/day is not enough to avoid starvation? Because I live in a Western country and I spend way less than that on a typical day.
There will be more demand for goods and services when more people participate in the workforce. At the moment minimum wages price millions of people out. How is that creating more demand? By what weird logic is getting paid 0$/day creating MORE demand than getting paid 20$/day? Working people not only create more demand than unemployed people, but their work also creates more goods and services. It's almost poetic, isn't it.
Your solution will decrease both demand for goods and services and the production of goods and services. That's what will turn developed nations into undeveloped ones.

Well seems like I don't have to dig very far, since you supported them just now in your second sentence. 
So basically you are saying that before there is UBI, you want to support big corporations and punish the unskilled and poor (by supporting minimum wage laws).


I have. Now tell me how many jobs like that exist in reality. Somebody's gotta take out the garbage and fix the plumbing too. I bet maybe 1% of people would continue working if they got no pay from it. 


You're missing the point. I could find countless ways of exploring the world and enjoying myself. I could spend more time with my wife and my kids. The problem is, the things I enjoy the most, do not bring much value to other people. At least not enough value for them to go to work everyday to give me free money to support doing those things.


Well those robots need to get built first. And it's not very easy to build complicated things at affordable prices. If it was, then we would already have them.
Let me end by telling you what's wrong with UBI. The answer lies in basic economics:
By giving people money for nothing, two things will happen:
-The amount of goods and services will stay the same (because of these people doing nothing)
-The demand for basic goods and services will increase, because poor people get more money to purchase them
The market for basic goods with correct for the increased money supply by raising prices. No amount of UBI will be enough, when there isn't enough products and services for everyone. 
What you tax you decrease, what you subsidize you increase.
The only way for a nation to have real wealth is for it to produce more goods and services. UBI does the opposite, because it subsidizes doing nothing.

I can see that your giving these issues honest thought and I really respect that.
I do believe you and me both want the same basic things: a prosperous world in which humans are free to pursue their dreams and happiness. It's just that we think differently about the means of getting there.
One idea that is important to understand is that contrary to a commonly held public belief, a majority vote does not ensure the best outcome. If ten thieves decide to form a mini-society and proceed to attack a lonely house outside civilization, we all recognize that these ten men can not simply vote 10-1 against the owner of the house to throw him out of his own house. Yet when this same thing happens at a much larger scale, the immorality of it is obfuscated. Majorities have supported all the past evils from ancient child sacrifices to which hunts and things like Nazism. This alone should demonstrate how we humans should not simply rely on unrestricted democracy. 
A better way to ensure fair societies would be to recognize certain core principles and values, which are never up for vote. This is what the US constitution tried to do and it succeeded reasonably well for a while leading the US to become a dominant economic powerhouse. Unfortunately the constitution has been largely set aside and is now replaced with secret laws and courts and the "national security" used as justification to any action including torture and lifelong imprisonment in "Gitmo".
Finally, to get back to our example in the room with three people:
I think your last analogy fails a little bit because you say that the rich guy already has the gun. But since the gun represents the monopoly on force in this scenario, I don't think he has a gun yet. They are voting on who will get one (the right to use force). The scene would also benefit from a few more voters, because there is always less rich people than there is poor and middle class people. If the socialist betrays his voters, then he won't (theoretically) get elected the next time. So he has to proceed with his plan and "tax" the rich man. Of course what will happen next, when the rich man has been stripped out of all his wealth, is that he will stop producing (why produce just to get instantly robbed) and the world is slightly worse off since less goods are available.
I'm not saying libertarianism can end all problems in the world. But I am saying that libertarians are guided by core principles and that is really refreshing to me. Democrats and republicans quickly end up in philosophically weird situations, like when the democrats support minimum wage laws, but when you ask them that if a higher minimum wage is good, then why should we not make it 100 000 $/month? Wouldn't that be even MORE good? Why not? That's where cognitive dissonance strikes in. Or when the republicans say the want a small government, while at the same time supporting wars and controlling peoples private lives. 
I think the libertarians are the only ones with a position that doesn't contradict itself. If you ask the libertarian what the minimum wage should be, he won't give you some arbitrary number. He will tell you that the wages should be decided by the labor markets. When you ask a libertarian what the tax rate should be, he won't tell you some arbitrary number, but say that all taxation is immoral.

Here's the problem: building means of production requires massive investments. Investments are big risks. Who is going to take a big risk without the possibility of a big reward? How will the workers, who are busy working, be able to simultaneously build better means of production, if there is no investor using his savings to fund it?
Accumulation of capital (savings) is essential when people need to complete big projects. 
I anticipate you will say that the workers will be the ones doing the saving. Here's my answer: not every person is able to save money as well as others. Some people just love to spend it. So there will be those workers who save money each month and those workers who would rather live lavishly and spend it away. Now the problem is of course that how would it be fair if both the savers and the spenders own the new means of production equally? That would simply send the message that saving doesn't make any sense. Why would I save money and pay for everything, when the others are spending their money away like crazy? So now nobody wants to save. And when there is no savings to invest, no new projects get started.

Seems like you have abandoned your position of supporting minimum wage laws. I applaud you for that. It's what rational minds do when presented with unbeatable arguments.
You say more people want to work but that couldn't be further from the truth. Work is a mean, not an end. The purpose of ALL human action is to reduce uneasiness. Work tends to increase this uneasiness and is thus not preferred by rational people presented with options that give a similar outcome without the work. I do not want to work. I want to drink fruit cocktails on a beautiful beach. That has a lot of value to me, in other words it's worth a lot to me. Are you willing to pay for that?
You talk about unpleasant work, but all work is unpleasant to some degree. Otherwise nobody would pay you to do it. You talk about feeding of despair, but let me give you a very practical example:
I offer you a job to come and clean my car for 6$/hour. I don't want you to do it at 7$ hour because it's not worth that much to me for you to do it.
Did I just make your position somehow worse? Did I feed off your despair? No. I made you a plain and simple offer which you can then freely accept or turn down. If you are in a tough spot, you might want to take my offer. If you make more than 6$/hour I'm sure you couldn't care less about my offer. But I didn't make your life worse. I simply increased the options you have on your table. An increased amount of options is never a bad thing.

Okay at least we have that in common then (capitalism). My problem is I don't really think we have much free market capitalism left. Do you like the fact that governments are now bailing out banks with tax payer money? It's no longer capitalism when profits are private but losses get socialized. Talk about perverse incentives to the bank managers. Are you willing to argue in favor of bank bailouts?
About the correlation, why don't we do something quick and simple. Take a look at the list of the happiest and saddest countries on earth:
How many of the saddest countries can you find in the top 20 of the economically free countries? How many of the happiest countries can you see at the bottom of the economic freedom list? I did not actually count, but I'm almost certain the answer will be zero.
I would not attribute the decline of US middle class to free trade alone. I think we should attribute it to rising labor costs in addition to free trade. Minimum wages and other labor costs are the real reason why China is more competitive in a free trade situation. That said, let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. Free trade benefits humanity immensely, because it allocates resources and production to those places that are best at producing particular items. It doesn't make sense for you to make things that I can make 100 faster and cheaper. Free trade is only a problem when governments bring a gun between the voluntary negotiations of employers and employees and force the unskilled low-productive members of the society to stay unemployed (I'm referring to the minimum wage laws).

Your main argument there was to attack the measures of freedom the study used. Indeed you might disagree with some of them and that's fine. The thing is that even if you disagree with the criteria, that particular criteria seems to have created a rather obvious correlation between well being. Thus the list seems to indicate that countries with regulatory freedom and small deficits are far better places to live than the opposite countries.
Hong Kong is another great data point, because we can easily see how much better off it is compared to mainland China. The people are not that different, so what created the huge wealth gap? It's pretty obvious Hong Kong grew faster than China because of it having greater (surely not perfect) economic freedom.
You also try to discredit Heritage, but here's a link to the Wikipedia article that uses other sources (as well as the Heritage source):
As you can see, the list is rather similar.

Let me begin by saying that I enjoy talking with you and that you make many good points. I really like being challenged in the way you do.
About bank bailouts: doing nothing, which would let the banks fail, would be far better than socializing the losses. Now everyone loses, even those people who avoided the problem banks and thus had no fault in the problem. If the government didn't intervene, only the ones who made risky investments with those banks would lose their money. That's how it's supposed to work: you take a risk, and if it succeeds you reap the reward. If it fails, you lose your principal. I agree that democracy is problematic here, because the regular people don't seem to understand why banks should be allowed to fail, just like bad companies should be allowed to fail in a capitalist system.
Correlation: Do you think it's just a coincidence that when you divide a similar set of people into ones with a lot of freedom and ones with only a little freedom, we seem to always see the former group thrive? I don't think I need to have a complex study to demonstrate why win-win situations would be preferable to a group of people over win-lose situations. 
Free trade: I agree with you that the world is changing fast and free trade and globalization have accelerated that change. It really does mean that many people need to re-educate themselves and find new jobs, and I understand how that's not so great for them. The thing is, no matter how difficult you make the voluntary trade between humans, people will still need to find new jobs because of technological advancements. And the more expensive you make it to hire labor in a country, the more automation you will see emerging.
You call the view of Mises that social policies lead to serfdom hyperbolic nonsense. But how would you describe a system, in which our unborn children are sold into debt slavery, so that we can spend more now? There are bonds that mature in 75 years, long after the issuers have died. How should we describe a system which uses violent force to collect 50% of what we produce via taxes in order to kill millions of people in illegal wars around the world?
Let me end with a quote:
"Money is a new form of slavery, and distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal – that there is no human relation between master and slave.” -Leo Tolstoy

Here's the problem: like the video stressed, the system is good only as long as the investments are able to create real wealth. But many investments fail miserably. Thus false wealth is created.

When you say free healthcare, you must mean a system in which money is forcefully taken from others in order to give some people health care services?
Thus the health care services are only without cost for those members of the society, who are unproductive or otherwise avoid taxes. The productive, law-abiding members pay not only for their own healthcare but also for the healthcare of these others. It seems a bit unfair to call healthcare "free" in such a system.

By making the units totally different from dollars and euros, you will only confuse people and hinder mass adoption.
Imagine seeing a cup of coffee priced as 200 000 bits, that's pretty confusing to the layman. Using millibits would make the most sense, since a cup of coffee would cost something like 2 millibits, which is closer to what people are used to pay in dollars or euros.

Point 1. 
Now you are making a straw man. I'm not the one approving trades. The individuals making them approve them. My point was that if you are not willing to give up your deflationary currency to a seller that only accept that particular currency, then clearly you don't value the product highly enough. It's all about the time preference of money and you prefer to hold your money more than buy the product.
Look here's the thing:
You are basically telling me people don't want to buy stuff if the currency is deflationary. I can counter you by simply pointing out that with the same exact logic, nobody should want to sell stuff if the currency is inflationary. What do you respond to that?
Point 2. 
Okay so inflation is good, why not have more of this "good thing"? Why not have 50% inflation? Wouldn't that increase the money velocity even more? Do you think computers and cell phones are a problem because they have deflationary prices? Are you not buying them because of that? Deflation happens naturally when humans become more efficient at producing goods and services. We should see prices dropping, because we get better every year. The fact that prices are increasing instead of dropping means we are being robbed out of the benefits of our increases in productivity.
Point 3.
So you think bringing up debt is irrelevant to the discussion? I think we both know inflation will get far worse because the FED has no other options than printing even more money and causing even more inflation to fight the debt. When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. US will never be able to pay back it's debt. The system basically prevents that, because every dollar you loan needs to be paid back with interest. Where do you get the dollars for both the interest and the actual amount you borrowed? You don't. It's a downwards spiral to hell.

I haven't given this a lot of thought so there might be problems with this, but how about mailing people a randomly selected public key-private key combination to a "wallet" that contains one token (for example a colored coin). When the votes (tokens) are sent, a number for the candidate is included in the transaction and shows up on the blockchain. Each voter can see from the blockchain that their public key has been included in the vote. 
To verify the identity, maybe the keypairs should be emailed after a person has succesfully logged in to an online identification system? Although I kind of dislike the idea that anyone might be able to connect your vote with your identity.

How could they possibly know what the buyer is going to use them for? If the buyer did suspect something like that, he would use an intermediary to hide his identity. Do you have evidence of this occurring at a meaningful scale? I have never met any business or businessman who would have refused to sell me something at market price or above market price. Have I simply been lucky my whole life?

Consumer sentiment will change the minute a big company starts to abuse its dominant position.

I don't think there is "controlled access to resources". The owners of the resources tend to sell to the ones with the highest bids.
Bitcoin mining actually shows you how governments do not have to step in. When one pool grew close to 50%, the market and the community had strong reactions and the situation got fixed. No government intervention was needed.
I agree that capital markets favor the greatest efficiency. The way this is expressed in capitalism is with the cheapest prices. I don't think (and probably you don't think either) that there is any inherent problem with an efficient actor growing big by providing the product in the cheapest fashion. We don't like so called monopolies if they start abusing their power. But that's when the markets correct that behavior. If one company starts abusing a dominant position with extortionist pricing, competition will quickly rush in because they see how big the margins are. I don't think there are many examples in the history of the world of such a tactic being successful for companies in the long run.

I agree with most of what you said. It's about different initiatives. An inflationary currency encourages the taking on of debt and big spending. A deflationary currency encourages saving money and careful consumption. Would you teach your children that it's good to take large amounts of credit and spend money like there is no tomorrow? I assume not, so why would you prefer creating a financial initiative for the society that encourages that kind of behavior?
You ask why someone would buy now, if their money is going to be worth significantly more next year, but that question can simply be flipped around: "why would anyone want to sell now, if their good is going to be worth significantly more next year?" I think we both know the answer: people need to eat now and they simply cannot delay crucial purchases. Will they spend less on unnecessary crap they don't really need anyway? Probably. Is that a bad thing for humanity and our planet?
You finally say that the debt is the real problem. I understand perfectly well that it would be a disaster to have deflation for the dollar, since it would quickly lead to a default. But that's only a problem when the deflation occurs in the currency you have the debt nominated on. A deflationary alternative currency might actually be the only escape option for the US. It's true that it can be risky to take loans when you have a deflationary currency. It would be better to save money instead. But when the debt is needed, I'm sure the deflation percentage will be taken into account in the loan contract. So the loan will get adjusted based on deflation numbers. Insurance companies will likely also offer insurances against runaway deflation.
Let me end by saying this: the current system is basically selling our children and grandchildren into debt slavery, so that our politicians can fund wars and the police/socialist/surveillance state. Is this really the best we can do? Prolonged wars would be impossible to fund if it wasn't possible to hide the costs by inflating the money supply. Ask the most war-hungry redneck in Texas if they still think bombing Iraq is a good idea, when they have to immediately pay 40 000 $ to fund it. He might suddenly feel like maybe there are better means to do foreign policy that don't necessarily involve blowing up buildings and destroying human lives.

I think we have similar end goals. I just don't think the solution to these problems should be something morally questionable. Slavery used to solve many problems for the land owners, but it wasn't a good solution because it was morally wrong. I feel the same way about taxation. It uses force, so it is similar to theft. It is the tyranny of the masses and the unproductive. Also, what you tax, you decrease and what you subsidize you increase.
According to the non-aggression principle, self defense is justified. If the life of me or my family members was directly and immediately threatened, I would be justified to perform moderate self defense. I still believe the best way to keep people in the society, is to give them a job. That's why minimum wage laws are so destructive, they leave big masses of low-productivity workers outside the workforce.

And people running governments don't have private interests then? Not only that, but they have a monopoly on violence and no need for any mutual contracts. They decide on a law and you have to obey without any agreement. Why should we trust them over private companies that rely on contracts instead of force?

You say that the Heritage study is biased. But other studies of economic freedom show similar results. Can you show me statistics on economic freedom that have drastically different results?
Yes I claimed there is a correlation between economic freedom and social well-being. I showed you data for the economic freedom part. I assumed you might know enough about the countries in the list to determine for yourself the correlation. Do you really need me to argue why Switzerland is a better place to live than Zimbabwe?
Okay I will drop Hong Kong just because I don't really need it, there are plenty of similar examples. How do you explain the differences between East and West Germany or North and South Korea? How do you explain the differences between Finland and Estonia? How do you explain the fact that Estonia is now thriving AFTER it abandoned socialism?
I account for the public good in a very simple manner:
Let people decide themselves what is good for them in their particular situations. That's all that is really needed, hands off. A politician will never make better decisions for my life than what I make, because they don't know anything about me. Public good is what is good for the individuals, since the public is simply a collection of individuals. And individuals are the best ones to decide what's good for them. So let's support voluntary free trade and the win-win situations it creates by the very definition. Let's not support the gun that the government points to our heads in order to stop voluntary trading. When force is applied to a trade situation, it becomes a win-lose or lose-lose situation.

That's a pretty bold claim. Unfortunately the rest of your writing doesn't back it up in any form. I would argue Ayn Rand was pretty much the polar opposite of Lenin. For example, Rand hated communism while Lenin loved it. Now it's your turn to provide an argument to support your claim.

Gold is not a currency. It's not suited for modern business use. I would rather pick a volatile currency with deflation than a steadily inflating currency. With inflation you keep losing.

The US on the other hand had a very limited government in the beginning and the most personal freedom. Not surprisingly it became the greatest country in the world. But now it's becoming every statist's wet dream and look at all the problems US is now facing.

The big thing here is that the banks will never even know that bitcoin is involved in these transactions. So if governments want to wage war on bitcoin with the help of banks and credit card companies to stop fiat to bitcoin conversions, they have a problem, since Brawker now provides a completely decentralized way to still be able to get bitcoins with fiat. Without the banks/CC companies even knowing. The only way to stop this would be to completely stop eCommerce. :) Damn, I really really likes this the more I think about it.

You have a strange definition of slavery.
I advocate for freedom. That includes the freedom to trade, whether it be land, labor or resources.
You see, when two people do a voluntary trade, both of them are better off. It's by definition a win-win situation. Socialism is not, because when force and violence is used against peacefully acting people, it's by definition a win-lose situation.

You mentioned violence, so I brought up moderate self defense. That's allowed by the non-aggression principle. I'm not shooting starving people. I'm defending my life against violent aggression. Don't you think people should have that right?
I don't expect anyone to lay down and die. I expect them to contribute to the society. There's a lot of work to be done. The problem isn't that there is no work. The problem is that people want to have a lifestyle comparable to kings 100 years ago without actually having to perform any work.
How do you define what's a "living wage"? If somebody makes 2$/hour, then surely they won't die of hunger. Make a 10h day and you have earned 20$. Nobody will starve with such an amount of money. You can live in a tent or in a car. So why exactly is 2$/hour (extreme example) not a "living wage" if you can eat like a king with it?

And will this UBI provide a higher income than what the minimum wage is? Because if not, then won't these people "die" because they don't have a livable wage, like you claimed earlier? And if the answer is yes, then why should anyone work when they can just feed of productive people like parasites?
By saying that "if a business can't afford to operate, it shouldn't exist" you seem to indeed acknowledge my position, which is that minimum wage laws will kill businesses and the people who formerly had jobs will now be unemployed. That certainly took a long time to get out of you, but I'm glad you arrived at last. :) This will of course hurt the smallest businesses the most and the people who get fired first will be the poor low-productivity ones. So basically by advocating for minimum wages you are out to kill the smallest businesses while supporting large corporations and punish the poorest of the workers while supporting the rich. How moral!
You claim that my questions are utterly irrelevant. But let me remind you it was you who claimed that a minimum wage will increase purchasing power. So how is it irrelevant to ask how exactly an unemployed person is supposed to have more purchasing power than an employed one?

Here's the problem: You said it's like "love making" when government interferes in free markets by regulating them. I on the other hand believe that to be very harmful to the economy. Why? Because individuals and free markets have a track record of creating wealth. Central planning and government over reach has a track record of creating the most terrible places on earth. We have good examples of divided regions in which the other side chose capitalism and the other side communism. Look at East/West Germany. Or North/South Korea.
Central planning and government interference in free markets is a bad thing. History has proven this over and over again. 
You say this is the best we have come up with? I say US has seen better times. US used to be the land of the free and that made it become the greatest super power ever seen. Now it's the land of lawyers, regulation and surveillance. This is NOT the best we have come up with.

Sure, I can pretty much agree with what you said there, although it kind of falls to the "no true Scotsman" camp.

I'm only going to reply to actual arguments. You did make one of those by claiming that the farmers do not reap the rewards of lowering their prices. Unfortunately that argument is really easy to refute:
Let's say I'm a farmer. I can create 10 bags of wheat every day, just like everyone else in the farming business. I charge 10 $/bag just like everyone else. My costs are 8 $/bag.
Now I come up with a new technique, that allows me to produce 20 bags per day and my costs are lowered to 4 $/bag. I can now lower my selling price to 8 $/bag in order to sell more bags and I will still make a nice 4 $ profit per bag. So as a result of my innovation, I can sell more bags, and do so with a higher profit margin and the consumer can eat more bread. Are you seriously claiming I won't massively benefit from that situation?
It's funny that you are pissed about people gaining wealth without doing anything, because that's exactly what happens when the fiat printing presses keep singing and banks expand credit. Money created out of thin air.

Governments have violently killed hundreds of millions of people and this is not even counting the wars. How many have corporations killed?

I think you just described the current system perfectly. The only ones allowed to use violence against others are the people in charge. So there really is only one person with a gun, and he is allowed to use it freely. You tell me there's no room for abuse in that situation? Libertarians would have it so that each person in the room are equally allowed to defend themselves against aggression. But no one is allowed to initiate force against others (the non-aggression principle).
In the current system, the people who promise to distribute wealth violently to give voters something for nothing are in charge. Want to get elected? Just say you will give your voters as much free stuff as possible. Stuff that you then have to violently take from those who have actually produced something for it. 
Let's take your example of a room with three people. There is one guy who is rich because he created a lot of value for others and thus they happily exchanged their money for his goods. Now there is an election and the winner gets the gun and the right to use force. The rich guy and a socialist guy are running. The socialist promises the third guy that if he votes for him, they will take all the money from the rich guy and share it with each other so that they never have to work again. Which one do you think the third guy will vote for? 
I also don't think poor people make it to congress very often in the current system.

Okay, so by not agreeing you are basically saying that people should be able to do whatever they themselves deem valuable, even if nobody else agrees, and expect others to fund that.
So when that's your position, why should I work? I would like to travel the world and sunbathe on beautiful beaches with a cocktail in my hand. I deem that valuable. And you have to fund that. Agree?
Look, here's the thing:
I agree that the things you described have value. I just think that value should be expressed by the person doing those things. So if I want to spend a year playing the guitar and that is valuable to me (not necessarily to anyone else) I should express that value by saving my own money to be able to do it. What would be evil would be to force you to give me money every week to support my guitar playing, even if you hated it. It's immoral to force others to pay for things they do not value.
 If I deem that I value highly staying home with the kids, then in our reality of limited resources, I express that value by spending less money on some less valuable things. If I understand you correctly, you would essentially have politicians decide what is deemed valuable for individuals (that's what taxation essentially does), so that they then can forcefully take resources from others and allocate them to the things they have deemed valuable. Hasn't the human kind already learned the bitter lesson of how badly this kind of central planning works? Or why did Soviet Union, East Germany and North Korea not turn out to be great places with all their amazing central planning?
It all boils down to whether we believe politicians to be better at determining what has most value for an individual than the individuals themselves.

One final point: deflation is what happens naturally when humans become better and better at producing things. Inflation is unnatural and a result of currency manipulation.

And right there is where your argument already fails. If the workers are paying other workers to work for them, then they have already morphed into the "evil" capitalists you despise so much. They are using their savings (capital) to fund production they have no other relationship with.
Another level where your argument fails completely is when the workers  don't actually WANT to own the particular factory they happen to work at, but they want to rather invest their hard earned money in something else that they believe will yield them more. Should they forcefully be stopped from doing that? In other words, would you have some politicians determine, where investments are allowed to flow? If not, then it's impossible for the workers to always own the means of production.
As for the short them thing I will point you to read some austrian economics. There is a time preference for money which the interest rates reflect (at least when not manipulated by a central bank). 
How much would you pay for a suitcase that contains 1000 dollars, if you would receive it instantly? 1000 dollars or less, right (because why pay 1000 dollars for 1000 dollars)? But what if I told you you can only get the suitcase after a year? Then you would probably be willing to pay even less for it. Maybe you would pay 900 dollars. That is your time preference for money. When there is a lot of savings, it means two things:
1. People are preparing to spend their money in the future instead of the present moment
2. Interest rates go down giving companies cheap money for starting big, long term projects.
These long term projects are perfect for the people who have saved money for the future.
It's quite beautiful actually. Unless politicians and the fed mess it up completely.

So you would rather be in a position, in which you need to negotiate yearly 5%+ raises with your boss in order to keep up with inflation? That makes you the one to keep asking. In a deflationary system, the tables would be turned: your boss would need to come to you to ask for this. It's a much better position for negotiations.
Also, let's not forget, that we people grow the economy each year and cheaper prices are a natural result of that. It's unnatural that prices go up while we grow the economy. The fruits of our efforts are basically being stolen from us by the money printers.

Okay, let me point out a couple of things:
1. When you say that the seller wont sell the item at all if he wont accept the inflationary currency, then clearly the buyer doesn't really need the product that much. Not buying unnecessary crap is a good thing and leads to less unnecessary crap being produced. I have bitcoins, which are deflationary. Yet at the moment I'm looking to sell some to be able to pay my rent. I need a house to live in regardless of deflation.
2. The quantity theory of money focuses on GDP which is not a good indicator of anything. I can sell you a piece of real estate that has 50% air in it's price because of a bubble caused by inflated M and it will increase the GDP even though no real growth happened. 
3. Even the great depression was over faster that the current fiasco. The US gov has created a spiral of debt that can never get paid. This debt spiral is far far worse than the so called deflationary spiral. It basically enslaves even the unborn children. Every american born has a debt of more than a 100 000 dollars on him. When the interest rates eventually have to go up, this whole system will crash and I think everybody knows it. There is no way out. China and Russia know what the game is based on their recent activity. The petro dollar that allowed US to get away with so much money printing, will not last forever.

Somalia is actually a failed socialist state. It doesn't currently have one big government, but many small ones. And like all governments, they use coercion and force to collect money from the people.
I might also ask you a counter question: If governments are so great, why don't you move to a country which has a very powerful governments? Like North Korea or Zimbabwe.
Actually, because many countries did give socialism a try, we can also look at some empirical real world data.
Here are past and present socialist countries:
Current Communist Countries: 
-China

We will get merchant adoption, when bitcoin outperforms fiat currencies so clearly and consistently, that merchants don't even want to touch fiat anymore.

When you look how the QE program correlates with rise of the US stock market, it is easy to see how a lot of that extra money goes to the stock market. It's logical: since nobody can keep money in bank accounts due to lower than inflation interest rates, the QE money finds it's way to real assets and creates new bubbles. Who benefits when the stock and housing markets go up? People and corporations that own a lot of stocks and real estate. Now ask your self "which group of people generally owns more stocks and real estate, the rich or the poor?" and you might arrive at the right conclusion.

I don't think so. Personally I'd be very happy with say a 1% annual price deflation. I don't need it to go to millions.

I'm not sure what that really means. There are constraints that come from the reality we live in. Like the fact that even now with 1mb blocks, an efficient full node needs at least 2mb upload speed. That's not a very common thing for consumers to have yet. I don't have 2mb upload (although I have 24mb download). With bigger blocks, that upload speed requirement grows even larger. How is that not a problem in your books?
@_date: 2016-03-12 20:44:17


It's very very different from the current situation, because bitcoin is acting like digital gold, which limits the amount of bitcoin nominated loans banks can make without risking a bank run. If we have deflationary money, people have very little reason to use fractional reserve banks. I'm sure you understand how that seriously limits the amount of currency that anyone can create.

Or could it perhaps be that a fee market kind of makes sense, because it's not really necessary or valuable to store each coffee cup purchase in the bitcoin blockchain? 
Do you think bitcoin should compete with centralized services, like Visa, when we both know it will never be able to do that? Is it the value proposition of bitcoin, that it can tackle Visa, Paypal and other services which can function at incredible speeds because they are centralized? Or is the value proposition of bitcoin perhaps the very fact that it is decentralized, inflation-free and censorship resistant?

You leave us with the only option to flee from the land of our fathers. Can you see why that is ironic?


I don't get it; how is respect of property rights an argument against all property? One might assume it's the exact opposite of that.


I do believe that. But I'm confused, since you seem to believe politicians are justified in extracting their share of my labor.

Because I don't understand when and how they have become legal owners of the wealth that has been built by my family for centuries.

It is the same choice mafia men give you. Accept their rules or get out. How is what you are describing any different?


Exactly. But if the current landowners had  children and passed the land to them, I would also respect that. I'm guessing according to your principles, the property rights of those children should not be respected if enough people came and voted against them?

That's a weird argument. Are the poor people alive? Then clearly they have some access to money. It's just that this money can now buy less and less thanks to QE.
You say wages don't lag behind inflation. Really? Did your job contract/labor union already price in QE? If not, then your salary lags behind inflation.
I wouldn't also put too much faith in the "official" inflation numbers, published by the same source that has the power to do the printing (talk about conflict of interest). They keep claiming inflation is 1-2% but all you need to do is to compare the prices you actually keep paying for common goods to the prices you paid for them a few years ago and you will see that the government estimate is way too small. There are alternative inflation stats that show a huge difference between the government numbers and reality.
Labor unions have a tough time existing, because they tend to kill the industry they put on a choke hold in that particular country. When you raise the salaries too much, your business becomes unprofitable and dies.

Any product can be harmful when consumed too much. If you go after tobacco companies, then you should also go after beer manufacturers,  soda and candy companies, wheat producers and so on. The list is endless. Even water can kill you if you consume too much of it. I also don't really understand why tobacco companies or the like would be a problem in a free society. Insurances companies would be all over them and they would pump up your health insurance costs if you smoked. That's a very good market driven incentive right there.


Are you saying politicians are magically above acting in their own self interest? The same politicians who give tobacco farming massive subsidies every year? Subsidies, that come from the tax money everyone is forced to pay based on threats of violence.
Are public needs well satisfied when the government takes tax payer money and hands it to too-big-to-fail banks to support their gambling? Is this the type of thing that we need governments for?

People will claim that paper bitcoins are useless. I think they are inevitable. We had paper notes also during the gold standard. Paper money is not so bad, as long as there is still a "gold standard". Paper money without limits is not so great.
My prediction is that we will have bitcoin paper notes that are redeemable for real bitoin. We will also have regular proof of reserves from the institutions issuing this paper money. If they try to print too much, there is a bank run and they go bankrupt. Checks and balances.

So basically we can summarize your principle to be that taking wealth forcefully from others is more acceptable if you deem that it doesn't affect their lifestyle. Now you need to define what affecting their lifestyle means. Who is the judge of that? You? A politician? Surely a rich man that pays 50% taxes has to cut his spending in half. It seems to me that affects his lifestyle a lot. 
Can we use the principle you apply to rich people here also for yourself, when we compare you to people living in third world countries? In other words, shouldn't you be paying 90% taxes because the burden on you would be smaller than for someone living with 20$/month? If not, why not?
Doesn't this same principle apply if a broke man robs you of your money? Clearly your money had less marginal utility to you than for someone with no money. If not, why not?

Okay let's go with that. In the current state of the system, there are a lot of so called dust transactions. It doesn't really matter if they are a spam attack or if there is some other reason for them. They are still not very important, because their value is so small. You might construct some kind of argument against me judging the value of those subjectively, but I believe in the price mechanism as a good value meter. If someone really wants to send a transaction, he is willing to pay more. So if we get a fee market, the number of transactions is likely to drop, because sending dust becomes too expensive. My personal view is that dust transactions are not a good use for the most trustworthy truth machine in the world. They are not important enough to get recorded for all eternity in an ever growing ledger.


Based on what Luke-jr said, my current 24/1 internet connection is too slow to have an efficient full node running. And I live in a big city in Finland. I don't think many countries routinely have over 2.1 mb upload speeds available. Now I understand that the thin blocks you mentioned might help here, but it seems like they are not about to get implemented any time soon. Now if only big financial institutions like Coinbase and such will afford to run nodes, then bitcoin is very easily attacked by tptb. Rumor has it that Coinbase is already under government pressure to include KYC/AML features into bitcoin. This is the biggest single threat to bitcoin.


You see this as a weakness in bitcoin, but I see it as a very positive thing. It's good that making changes to the protocol is very very difficult. That gives me confidence that bitcoin really is going to hold it's essential promises like the 21mil cap. I don't think it's fair to blame core developers alone for not lifting the cap. Chinese miners have been very conservative with their views on blocksize increases.


Funny for me it was the other way around. I viewed Gavin as a very good guy so I gave his opinions a lot of weight and so I was firmly in the big block camp for a while. But after getting more information on Mike Hearn, I must cast some doubt even on Gavin, because they teamed up. I'm sure you are aware that before bitcoin Hearn worked for the government? And after that he worked for the security of the very same Google department that was later found in the Snowden documents to have been compromised by NSA. Now he works for the big banks. He was also pushing very shady stuff into bitcoin like blacklists and trying to block tor usage. It has become blatantly obvious, that Hearn was a government guy all along. The fact that Gavin tried to hijack bitcoin together with Hearn should raise some red flags.


I'm not so worried about mining pools because individual miners can switch pools very easily. We have already seen this dynamic play out: when one pool was getting too close to 50%, the price fell and miners quickly abandoned that pool. I am worried about the network propagation. If a 2mb blocksize will basically require a 4mb upload connection, then not many people can run full nodes anymore. It makes 99.9% of bitcoin users having to trust SPV, which makes it no longer a trustless system. The only real way to be absolutely sure about the current blockchain situation, is running a full node. I'm sure you would agree?


 
It doesn't matter what core believes. Anyone can fork the code. That's the only thing that matters. I wouldn't blame anyone for the fact that the core has simply more credibility at the moment than other options. I'm sure even you would agree that they are extremely bright people who have done many many concrete contributions to bitcoin over the years. They also have the right principles, or at least blockstream people, who are long-time cypherpunks. I will trust a cypherpunk over a government man any day. I know that is not a strong argument (it's argument from authority) but I'm not smart enough to understand the source code myself, so I must sometimes consider the authority of the arguers as well.


Sorry, it was a video interview and I couldn't find it by a quick google search. I'm willing to drop that point because I don't feel like watching hours of old interviews right now.
EDIT: This is the best I could find for now: 


All I can say is that I'm very thankful the power did not shift to Mike Hearn. If you believe in something, you should hold on to your belief and fight hard for what you believe is best. That's what core is doing.


It's a free market of discussion platforms. I have nothing against the owners of websites setting rules for the users. If the users don't like the rules of a particular website, they can use another one. If they are alone in their dislike of the rules, then that is of course not the problem of the moderators. Also, are we not debating these very issues right now?


Do you have the slightest shred of evidence that these have anything to do with core? If not, then you should drop this point.


I have a hard time buying that argument. The miners are free to use whatever software they want. They are also free to mine whatever coin they want. Users are free to buy whatever cryptocurrencies they want. Developers are free to develop whatever software they want. And everyone is free to discuss on whatever communication channels they want. Sound pretty free to me. 


Then why are these people not putting their money where their mouth is by actually adopting different software or buying different coins?


Maybe on your side, but do you think your full node made useful contributions to the network propagation?

Nope, you are incorrect in this. Just ask a developer. Someone will always have to store the entire blockchain for bitcoin to work.

Unions can raise prices of course, but often those unions that are truly powerful don't serve the poorest labor sectors. So when a doctors union might get away with a extremely high raise, poorer parts of the work force typically get raises far behind the real inflation rate. Which only supports my original point, that the rich have ways of hedging against inflation while the poor don't.
@_date: 2016-03-17 21:33:47
First sorry about the long wait for a reply, I was quite busy the last week.


I simply mean very small transactions that are worth say 5 cents. I would argue that storing such tiny transactions on an ever growing ledger is not good use of the ledger, since the real value provided by the ledger is truth, and truth is not in great demand when dealing with insignificant sums of money.


Here you go:


Who would store the entire blockchain in this case?


I disagree. With bitcoin the whole ecosystem is not the bitcoin blockchain. It's the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, which has hundreds of comptetitors and thus can't be centrally planned.


There one key difference: there was no free market competition and no voluntarism. With bitcoin we have competing cryptocurrencies plus pariticipation is completely voluntary.


You are not free to do that. There are borders and border controls (men with guns ready to shoot you) and you need visas and endless amounts of bureacracy. It's also very different to change your physical location than your virtual location. I browse websites from all over the world all the time. It's really easy. Changing cryptocurrency is almost as easy as browsing to a different website. You can't compare it to moving physically, because it's obviously much easier to browse the internet than to travel physically into different countries.


No. Lightining network is intended for small and fast transactions. Not much trust is needed for those. I don't care if I lose 5 cents. I do care if my lose my life savings. 


Could be. But do we need to risk it? Do we need to store all these low value transactions to risk it? Or could we just not risk it and not store low value transactions?


It would be a bad move to leave the most popular subreddit. They would have a harder time reaching the users.


How do you know that no opposing opinions were presented there?


Why should private people announce their meetings publicly?


How are they different scenarios? In scenario 1 what "problem" is there if no one else but the trademark holder can register the domain?


So is that a false claim then? Is Theymos a core developer or forced to do what they command?
No, I have zero proof of either side's attacks. I have consistently heard about DDOS attacks from bitcoin operators long before XT/Classic even existed though.


Pretty much yes in the sense that they have no obligation to care about anyone else but themselves. They have every economic incentive to be good actors though. Keeping that in mind, it is up to their own best judgement to determine what being a good actor means in practice.


Don't worry, this will still happen. It just doesn't necessarily have to happen on-chain if the transacted sums are insignificant to everyone.

The most effective strategy for statist governments to combat bitcoin would be to drive the price down and then point to how the market simply didn't want a "central bank free" currency. The government wouldn't look oppressive but bitcoin would still (possibly) go away. Sound like a nice plan.
They could achieve this by using their endless fiat printing capabilities to buy bitcoin, sell it to create downwards pressure, buy it again at a loss and sell it again to create more downwards pressure.

No argument there. But the upside is also far greater with bitcoin. It is perfectly reasonable to expect bitcoin to go up thousands of percents. The upside with gold is much more moderate. We also don't know the amount of future gold supply. We might find a way to suddenly extract hundreds of tons of additional gold per year. That is not possible with bitcoin. We have perfect knowledge of the supply.

Right, because the traditional finance sector does not use resources at all?
Just think about the endless amount of people you need to run the current system. Not only is their time a resource in itself, but they need things like electricity, heating, ventilation, lighting, transportation, buildings, computers, chairs, tables, printers and paper in order to do their job. Bitcoin can use a whole lot of energy every day before it gets anywhere near the footprints of the traditional system.

Interesting idea. If you can convince enough people that this is the best way forward, then maybe you can create a competing implementation? What other possible mechanism could there be than that?

And what about those (likely the majority) that disagree with this vision of bitcoin you have?

In other words, how is the system not already working exactly the way it should?
@_date: 2016-03-04 11:25:07


It can also be spammed with minimum transaction cost. That's one of the most likely and easy attacks towards bitcoin. Personally, I use bitcoin as a store of value. I don't really mind paying 25 cents to move my coins occasionally. It's still cheaper than any alternatives. And let's not forget that layers on top of bitcoin will still allow the cheap micro-transactions that you want so badly. It's just that they will be slightly less secure, but absolute security is not the most critical feature for cheap and fast micropayments.


Thanks for pointing that out. I certainly don't want to have any blind spots in my thinking, so it's good that you pointed out my lack of reply. I will go and write you a reply there.


Please elaborate. Your are not making an actual argument there.


Can you give me a single good reason, why bitcoin should be directly used for micropayments, instead of much faster layers built directly on top of it? I'm fairly confident you don't have a good answer for this.
@_date: 2016-03-12 15:40:26


First of all, the word "waste" implies there are no benefits for the electricity consumed. I'm not wasting electricity when I use my electric bike to get to work. Similarly bitcoin is not "wasting" energy, when it's securing the blockchain. 
We can easily estimate the amount of electricity consumed for bitcoin mining daily: each day we get roughly 3600 blocks of bitcoin. For mining to be profitable from a game theory perspective, the electricity for that mining should not significantly top 3600 x $420 = 1.5 million dollars per day. I'm simplifying on both sides by not counting for possible expected value changes to bitcoin (which might make some people mine at a loss) or the effects of capital controls (which might make some people mine at a loss) or the cost of the mining equipment (which balances things because it makes mining less profitable).
Is 1.5 million dollars per day a lot for a global truth machine?
Well, in the US alone 136 million dollars worth of electricity is used daily for just street lights. I'd say that the bitcoin blockchain is not even remotely significant as an electricity consuming system.


This is very demonstrably false. The goverments can always create inflation. Just print more money. Didn't work? Print x 100 more. Still not enough inflation? Print 10 000 x more. I guarantee you that they can create inflation if they simply print enough. That's not the problem at all.

Earlier you said "I shouldn't have to abandon everything just because I have problems with some parts of it."
Well again, you don't have to. Nobody is forcing you to abandon anything. It is your own option. So there is no "should't have to abandon". You don't have to abandon. Are we clear? Or is there an invisible gun to your head forcing you to abandon bitcoin?


I'm saying it's an open source software project. Think you are smarter than the core devs? Think you can write a better system? Just do it. It's open source. You have everything you need. If you are not a coder yourself, support XT or Classic. Just don't try to make me do it, because I'm very happy with the current system. I'm not telling you to leave, I'm telling you to improve the system. Hell, if you come up with something truly amazing, I might even join you.


If you hate so much how this place is being run, then why do you insist using it? Create something better. If it's good, I might join you there. What other options do you really have? What other options should you really have? This is not your house. Theymos is in charge of this place, and I have to say I absolutely love it.


I haven't told you either of those things. Stop lying. I'm simply outlining some options for you. And I'm responding to your points, one by one. How is that not a discussion? I have to say, you kind of give me the impression of someone who just loves to complain about what others have built while never building anything yourself. 


I have no power to tell anyone to leave this place. I can simply tell you what I think is logical. It takes you about 3 seconds to switch to a different bitcoin subreddit. If you hate this place so much, why not do that? My guess is because you would still like everyone to build things for you without you building anything yourself and then keep complaining.


Your voice was heard. The sound wasn't very pleasant. Your arguments were considered and rejected after consideration. What now? Should we just keep listening to the same old tired, debunked arguments for all eternity? Is that how we should spend our time?


Oh yes, because the progress in the US has been so positive during the recent decades. You are like a guy telling Ford that his car is bullshit and that the car should be improved this and that way. He listens to you and explains why that is not possible. You do not proceed to prove him wrong by actually building a better car. Instead you come to the factory day after day and keep repeating your criticisms. Would mr. Ford be wrong in telling you to build it yourself if you know everything so much better than him?

Demonstrably false with bitcoin. Yes you can create bitcoin nominated debts in a computer database. But those debts are not money, they are currency at best. Bitcoin is a bearer instrument.


I have a hard time seeing how this is a "necessity". Debts are agreements and we humans can make agreements that better accommodate deflationary money.


Yet we have had hundreds of years of deflationary periods in history.


And this current inflationary system does not necessarily have to collapse then? When you borrow every unit of your currency in to existence, you can never ever pay it all back with interest. Have you heard of many countries paying off their national debts during the recent decades?


I have nothing against credit. But you can also make loans with actual bearer instruments, which will ensure that the amount of loans  match with the amount of savings. Nothing forces us to do fractional reserve banking.

Who exactly needs to "accept complaints"? The core developers? What does that even mean? Should they become politicians instead of coders, telling everyone that they are "listening"? Or do you mean this subreddit, owned by Theymos, who has every right to run it the way he best sees fit. If you have a problem with that, use a different communication channel. This is Theymos's house. He has the right to kick you out if you are annoying. The good news is that you build a thousand houses for free on the internet.

Are we not discussing then? What is this process you and me are involved in right now?


I haven't told anyone to leave. I simply pointed out that it's a real and viable option and makes this whole situation less of a problem for everyone. Everything is voluntary in the bitcoin world. There is no gun to your head, like in a traditional democracy.


You must have some brilliant mechanism for solving differences in open source projects that we are not aware of. The beauty of open source is that anyone can improve the code. And people are completely free to adopt your new code, if they think it's better. How would you want this mechanism to work if not like that? Should we ask governments to come in and start forcing people to do stuff?

Compared to what? Certainly not if you count human labor hours as resources. Just think about the endless amount of people you need to run the current financial system.

I have good news for you. The free market WILL make that decision. If people are not happy with bitcoin, they will go elsewhere. Free market in action. People who want a system in which every single little purchase is stored forever, can create their own alt-coin or start using any of the hundreds of already existing alt-coins that don't have a 1 mb limit.

I come from a country with universal health care. Guess what? It's so unbelievably bad, that only the poor people use it. Everyone with a little bit of money will use a private doctor. Having universal health care is like eating at a communist restaurant: they have your business no matter how badly they treat you.

 &gt;They are not, hence the elections to change them from time to time.

Okay let's take a look at this claim more carefully. It seems to me that from a standpoint of the spammer, it makes no difference if there is 100 kb space left on a block and the fee is 20 satoshis per kb (100 x 20 = 2000 satoshis) or if there is 1000 kb space on the block and the fee is 2 satoshis per kb (1000 x 2 = 2000 satoshis). So this claim doesn't really hold water. The claim is even weaker when you consider that in the first scenario 900 kb less spam will get recorded on the ledger for all eternity, making the attack even less succesful while still costing the exact same amount.


The viability of microtranscation use cases is already reduced by design: there is an average of 10 min block confirmation time. Can you please address this point? It seems pretty obvious that micropayements will be handled on a layer on top of bitcoin that will be able to work in milliseconds rather than waiting for minutes.

Right, I had a hard time making the connection between the use of violent force (tribal warfare) and a peaceful and completely voluntary system (bitcoin).


Except that is not how banks operate. They don't actually require your savings in order to be able to create and lend money.


You have it backwards: if I keep my money out of circulation, it means I'm not demanding my rightful share of goods and services from the society. I'm leaving goods and services available for everyone else, which is actually a huge favor from me. Since there is now less money chasing the same amount of goods and services, their prices have downwards pressure, which is again very good for the consumers.


If I decide to put $50 million inside my mattress instead of building a hotel, it means that the labor and resources required to build that hotel are now available for other people. Instead of making those resources satisfy my needs and ends, they are available for other people to satisfy their needs and ends.

How much electricity, heating, ventilation, lighting, transportation, how many buildings, computers, phones, chairs, tables, printers, pens, folders and paper do you think they need in order to do their job?

That's a big fat lie. Bitcoin's volatility has indeed decreased significantly over the years.


Well yes to be fair I shouldn't have said market cap there, but liquidity instead. But for liquidity to grow, the market cap has to grow as well. At the moment it is impossible to purchase 10 billion dollars worth of bitcoin, because the entire market cap is smaller than that.


Oh please, I already told you why bitcoin is a terrible example at this point in time when it's still so small that a 100k sell order can swing it significantly.


 
Which again is a feature that increases the risk of holding the asset and makes it less suitable for hoarding.


How many times do I have to say this: bitcoin is not deflationary at the moment.
Has gold been a terrible store of value? It's close to being deflationary money after all. No. It has been the only safe store of value during the entire history of civilization.

Yes, there is still monetary base inflation going on with bitcoin, but in 20 years it will be practically deflationary assuming some amount of coins will get permanently lost or destroyed every year.
From the perspective of price inflation, bitcoin is wildly deflationary, simply because capitalism itself is a deflationary system when left to it's own devices: we humans become better at production every year so there is a natural tendency for prices to fall. The only reason why prices are not falling, is the massive money printing going on with the fiat money systems. In the 60's people used to wonder what new generations would do with all this free time, since they saw that production increases 10% every year. They predicted that we would have something like a 2 day workweek. Those production increases actual held pretty well, but we still don't have a 2 day workweek. Why? The answer can pretty much be simplified to the removal of the gold standard in the 70's, which removed the last limit for endless inflationary money printing.

In 2025 we have less than 1% inflation, IF we assume that no coins get lost or destroyed. It's practically inflation free by then if we account for lost bitcoins.
Fiat cash inflation was under control when it was gold backed. It was the removal of the gold backing that started the endless price inflation cycle.

I'm going to quote luke-jr on this:
The average node can't simply download each block over 10 minutes. It needs to download and upload multiple times over well under 30 seconds. Otherwise, the relay time across the network cannot perform sufficiently, and mining is forced to be centralised and exposed to censorship risks. Essentially this means that even 1 MB blocks have an typical node requirement of 2.1 Mbps upload, well over what is available in the average city today.
You also need to pay attention to total transfer limits. Typical limits for cellular connections, for example, are 5 GB, which is just barely enough to leech on 1 MB blocks (forget using it for the average node). Some Bitcoin users in Miami (a fairly big city) expressed to me that their nodes were already (with &lt;1 MB blocks) using too much of their bandwidth limit to be comfortable with an increase.

Even the whitepaper says that eventually all miner income is from fees alone. 75% bitcoins have already been mined. We are starting to see that transition. If bitcoin should remain secure, then the fees need to be big enough for the miners to have the incentive to secure the network.


I'm not sure why you use the word "artificially" here, because the fees are market driven and based on supply and demand.


There are plenty of those still. Remittances, censorship resistance, smart contracts and settlements for example.


I think it's fine to do at the moment. But if many people keep doing this, then it creates more and more incentives for dishonest people to double spend. But yes sure, I'm, willing to surrender the point that it's basically the problem of the merchant.

I thought the vision was a peer-to-peer, decentralized, fixed amount monetary system, uncensorable by goverments. Was there more to it?


Which is easily prevented by a fee market.


How has this been proven false? To run a useful full node, you need over 2mb/second upload speed already now, with just 1mb blocks. How many regular people have that high upload speeds? I know I don't (I have a 24mb/1mb connection).


This is a pretty big topic to completely avoid. Can you outline once again why a fee market, which is the end goal of bitcoin anyway after the block rewards subsidies end, would be a bad idea?


Oh kind of like every product ever was built in a "planned economy"? That's a pretty weird word that you are using, remembering we are talking about free market, open source product development. Humans act and make plans. Core developers act and make plans. Are they wrong in doing that?

I don't want to pump any specific altcoins here, but I do think there is real competition. Many people who think they missed the "bitcoin train" get easily hyped up when they think someone has invented bitcoin 2.0. When these people get invested in an alternative cryptocurrency, that coin might go permanently up in value and cause a positive spiral effect. Recently one altcoin was on Reddit frontpage for example. I don't think there will be just one winner in the cryptocurrency space, because different coins have different niches and people with different ideologies might choose their coin based on their world view. For example, some people want strong anonymity, others want full transparency. There can't be one coin that fits everyone. It doesn't have to be a "winner takes it all" situation in my opinion, because converting from coin to coin will be made super simple and fast. You might not even know it when your wallet makes a conversion in the background.
@_date: 2016-03-08 16:25:39
First of all I'd like to thank you for a well thought out response. I very much enjoy your calm tone and lack of Ad Hominems. Let's have the ideas fight, not  people. I must give you an upvote even if we disagree on things.


Although I appreciate your attempt to use actual math, I must question some assumptions there. Why are you not for example accounting at all for segwit?
But for the sake of argument, let me agree with you that maybe a deep pocketed attacker will create a situation, in which the fees will temporarily increase to even 10$/transaction. I'm relative certain that such an attack, while it  would certainly suck, could not last for a very long time period. That would mean that I wouldn't have cheap access to my savings for maybe some days. Compare that to the traditional banking system, where access to my saving can be denied permanently at any moment. It would also be a massive wealth transfer from the attacker to the bitcoin miners, which is not necessarily a bad thing for bitcoin.


Yes you understood me correctly. I'm a long term holder and I'm willing to sacrifice some of the sort term gains in order to ensure that bitcoin grows in a sustainable fashion and most importantly, remains as decentralized as possible. Central points like Coinbase are under constant government pressure. Bitcoin is alive only because it's decentralized. I'm willing to sacrifice short term adoption to ensure that.


Every company is centrally planned even if the market is free. Linux is free and open source, but it is centrally planned. Bitcoin is centrally planned, but exists in a free market of competing cryptocurrencies. As long as we have the free market, I don't care if companies operating in that market have centralized leadership. Let's also remember how great it is to have open source code: anyone who is not happy with bitcoin can create a better, competing implementation. Many have also tried to do exactly that, but they have been rejected by the bitcoin ecosystem so far.


Fair enough, for Gavin's use of the words maybe he did not mean it because of the blocksize issue. But does it fundamentally matter why Gavin thinks bitcoin is not ready for mass adoption, as long as he still thinks that?


I don't think 0 conf is a long term strategy for anyone. If enough merchants accept 0 conf then it will create a class of opportunists who try to double spend as much as possible. They won't always succeed, but they will keep doing it and enjoy the rewards.


He believes this based on the fact that some full nodes are struggling even now, with only 1mb blocks.


You might be right about this. I don't know enough about thinblocks to make a good counterargument. I need to research it some more. What is the response from core devs?
@_date: 2016-03-13 00:16:25


Weird, but last time I checked I didn't have any dollars in my pocket.


I thought that a lack of competition is generally even more economically inefficient. And with services like shapeshift, what is the problem really?


Which of course no currency on the planet is.
@_date: 2016-03-10 14:22:29


This is myth spread mostly by Peter Todd for RBF pushing. Miners won't include them. Economic incentives are exactly opposite.
Okay, I think you are actually making a verifiable claim here. We can simply look at the current blockhain and ask if dust transactions have been included in it. Because you would have to agree that the answer ir very much a "yes", then calling it a myth starts to sound pretty unreasonable. Your counter point might be that raising the orphan amount will fix this tendency, to which I have a two part rebuttal: 
1. I think raising the orphan amount is a negative thing and should be avoided if other means are available (like raising the fees).
2. There is no demonstrated relationship between block size and orphan rate. I will quote another redditor called yeh-nah-yeh:
Back when blocks were averaging ~0.1 mb the orphan rate was ~1.5%.
Now blocks are many times larger, averaging 0.6 mb and often 0.97 mb the orphan rate is... ~1.5%
No difference!


Did you know that it's not possible to prune the blockchain in a manner that would permanently get rid of transactions? In other words, the entire blockchain has to always be stored by someone, preferably as many people as possible. 


You are clever in your usage of the phrase "central planning" since I certainly abhor the central planning done by socialist and fascist governments. It is important that we recognize a key difference though: if the market is free and voluntary, there is nothing wrong with some actors planning things centrally. Every company in the world uses central planning, and I have nothing against those companies, since it's completely optional for me to buy or not buy their products. Same thing with the bitcoin blockchain: participation is completely voluntary and we can at any given moment choose to use a different system if we feel like it.


other priorities. But it can easily be done, it is already done and working in other client.
I don't know enough about this issue to give you meaningful answers, but I'm certainly willing to admit that if what you say is true, then it would help to ease my worries regarding block size increases. Maybe this is the matter we should focus on, since it is your strongest argument against my position so far?


Both of us are speculating on future outcomes. So me saying that if server-like infrastructure will be needed to run nodes properly, then regular people will not be able to run them anymore, thus nodes will likely be run by financial institutions, is no more "imaginary" than any other prediction your or me are making here.


I'm not currently running a node. I tried, but my SSD became too full and my internet slowed down too much.


The point is simple: if regular people can't meet the technical requirements for running full nodes, full nodes will mainly be run by large corporations.


I can say the same thing though: you can switch from core to classic at any point if you want. That's the beauty of the situation. We are completely free to choose. 


They can be against it, and they have certainly their right to their opinion, but they can't stop other people from doing it.


The situation is that segwit is supported pretty much universally. There is good consensus. Even then, it has certainly been debated rigorously on Reddit. If there wasn't universal support for it, it would not get implemented.


No disagreement there.

If someone writes software that is more desirable for the bitcoin ecosystem, then they will take the lead. So far that hasn't happened. There has been several attempts as you know. Clearly the majority of actors in the ecosystem have decided to stay with core. Too bad if that's not what you happened to desire. But this isn't a democracy. You can't tell other people what they have to do.

Nobody forces you to use bitcoin or stops you from using it. That's all that a free market needs.

I don't know what you are talking about. It's much more simple: if your ancestors decided to keep their wealth in gold, that investment would still have retained it's buying power after all those centuries for their children and grandchildren and grandchildren's children to enjoy. Name a single other investment that would have kept it's value like that.


Deserve? Wow that's a weird term to use in this context. You do not get to decide what someone "deserves". The correct risk-reward ratio is determined by the market, not you.


No, like I said hoarding frees up societal resources. If this is so hard for you to understand, let's look at a simple practical example:
Let's say you run a store that rents out cars. You and I have made a contract that gives me the right to use ten cars for ten years. I have the right to do that at any given moment. I decide that I don't need the cars right now. After twenty years I still haven't consumed any of your car resources. In the meanwhile these car resources have been available for you to make money with. You have been renting them out like crazy and making a lot of money with them. Some of this money you have probably invested further to make even more money. How am I the bad guy for not using your precious resources?

Okay your post was written politely and calmly so thanks for that. I'm having trouble with this claim though. Could you elaborate a bit further? Namely, why does it follow that would we have to forget about the digital gold use case if we can't do micropayments directly on the blockchain layer? Don't you think that the most important features of bitcoin are decentralization, the fact that it's (soon) the only deflationary currency in the world and that it's censorship resistant? Those features are only strengthened if as many people as possible can handle the amount of gigabytes the blockchain requires.

So can you answer this: in a relatively free marketplace, do we tend to get multiple competing companies trying to make the most attractive product or is it usually just a single company making phones, another one making cars, a third one making web pages and so on?
I'm going to argue that there is always competition in free markets. The only reason why there isn't multiple competing dollars at the moment is the government enforced central banking system. Cryptocoins are not government backed monopolies, thus there will be fierce competition. As cryptocoin consumers, we should be happy about that.

And how could they possibly get away with that in a free society? If one insurance company started to make big margins and profits, another one would steal all it's customers by cutting their margins and profits slightly.


All the smokers in the world disagree with you. I used to smoke when I was younger. It certainly does have it's benefits, it can be very relaxing and enjoyable for example.


Many things are addictive in life. Many get addicted to playing video games for example. Playing a lot of video games can have negative health consequences. Should the government start to regulate gaming?
If people go without insurance, it's only fair that they pay the possible costs of doing that. If I buy Apple stocks with all my money and the stock crashes, I should be the one paying the price of my gamble. If I decide to gamble by not getting an insurance, I should be the one paying the price of my gamble.
You didn't answer many of my questions. Why do you think that is? For example, I asked you if you think politicians are somehow above acting in their own self-interest?

I wouldn't say the world is getting rid of paper money at all. It's true that most purchases are probably paid with cards, but that's very different from "getting rid of". I pay almost everything with my card, but I would never vote for completely getting rid of cash. Now I understand it would be a wet dream for all the statist and totalitarian souls but I don't want to be fully at the mercy of banks and there are many situations in which cash is still very much needed. Not everyone even has a bank account.

What you are describing is every entrepreneur's worst nightmare. If my supermarket was selling something harmful to the people, I would immediately lose a lot of money and customers. I have every incentive to make sure my customers are super happy and that means delivering them only the best possible goods. Contrast that to politicians, who have no skin in the game. If someone dies because of a crappy government policy, they don't lose a single dime. Actually quite the opposite happens: when the government screws up and thousands of people die like in 9/11 they get rewards: better ratings, bigger budgets and more power and control over everyone.
Now if you want some kind of check ups for supermarkets, why couldn't the free market deliver that? There are many market organizations that review consumer products.

Why exactly would it rise that much all of a sudden? There is a basic economic law called the downwards sloping demand curve.


So what? Like the core devs and even Gavin have repeatedly stated, bitcoin is simply not ready for mass adoption yet. Let's be patient.


You don't want to be doing micropayments on-chain anyway, because of 10 min confirmation times. If you buy something more expensive than a cup of coffee, I'm pretty sure it's fine to pay a fee of 10 cents.


From Luker-jr:
"The average node can't simply download each block over 10 minutes. It needs to download and upload multiple times over well under 30 seconds. Otherwise, the relay time across the network cannot perform sufficiently, and mining is forced to be centralised and exposed to censorship risks. Essentially this means that even 1 MB blocks have an typical node requirement of 2.1 Mbps upload, well over what is available in the average city today. You also need to pay attention to total transfer limits. Typical limits for cellular connections, for example, are 5 GB, which is just barely enough to leech on 1 MB blocks (forget using it for the average node). Some Bitcoin users in Miami (a fairly big city) expressed to me that their nodes were already (with &lt;1 MB blocks) using too much of their bandwidth limit to be comfortable with an increase."

Here's why I'm not afraid of the mining centralization:
They have every incentive to be good actors. If the miners do something scary, the price of bitcoin will drop immediately.
Bitcoin is not a democracy, but a voluntary system. Those are so much better than democracies because other people can't force you to do anything. If someone changes bitcoin into something you don't like, you can leave very quickly for an alternative. Do you think Nixon would have been able to pull of the removal of the gold backing from the dollar, if Americans had hundreds of alternative currencies available to choose from?

Can you buy a cup of coffee with gold? Does gold not have value? Bitcoin is not valuable because it's some new, inferior version of Visa (it will never ever be as fast as Visa or other centralized services). It's valuable because of it's use as a censorship resistant store of value. That's the one thing bitcoin does better than any other thing. It simply isn't the best tool for buying a cup of coffee.


So you have no problem with extreme centralization then? Or do you think ordinary people will happily download and store hundreds of additional gigabytes each month?


We are both having our say on the matter. If I'm guilty of dictating something, then so are you.


Are you?


This is not really relevant to the "free market" angle we were talking about. You claim bitcoin is not a free market because of the core developers making tough decisions. Give me a break. Do you think there should be some kind of tyranny of the masses democratic process in place? Do you think democracy is a good mechanism for free markets?
It all boils down to this:
Bitcoin will never be able to compete with centralized services for small everyday transactions where speed is more important than  truth. Bitcoin's killer app is that it is a reliable source of truth in a world where truth is both rare and valuable. Using it to record everyone's coffee purchases is absurd, because those are not situations in which truth is very valuable. People will also not wait for several confirmations for a cup of coffee. But they will wait half an hour for a valuable purchase (car, house) to settle. It's you who is trying to force bitcoin to be used for something it's not suited for.

How should this decision process work if not exactly like it's working right now? Should the core just obey those that shout the loudest?

Thank you Theymos for all the hard work you are doing. I must admit I was upset with some of the moderation policies earlier, but I understand them now and I think you made the right choices. Kudos to you for standing with what you believe in, even when it clearly made you so unpopular in many peoples eyes. That shows real character! I have never had more faith both in the moderators here or the core developers. You have demonstrated how cool and level headed you can remain during all these hostile campaigns.

No it's not. I can't just come to the US for example. The are borders and border controls and visa's and passports and endless bureaucracy involved. If I try to ignore those factors, I will face violent force. With bitcoin, there is no violence. It's 100% voluntary. Big difference.


Of course. No argument there. But the difference that makes all the difference in the world is whether or not the decision making process is voluntary.


Okay so you have an opinion about how bitcoin should be developed. I have a different opinion. What mechanism do you propose for moving forward from this point? Some kind of democracy where two wolves and a sheep vote what's for dinner? What is the concrete mechanism you want to have in place instead of the current system?


Really? The decentralized nature promised equality? Can you elaborate a bit further how you would derive "equality" from decentralization? Of course we are 100% equal already now in the sense that any person on the planet is equally free to develop and fork bitcoin. 


I have good news for you: you are allowed to sell all your bitcoins and sign up for something else.
@_date: 2016-03-12 22:07:24


Bitcoin is a really bad example, because it has a tiny market cap which is actually a known and logical cause for volatility. It's also not deflationary at the moment.


Let's assume what you say is true. If any bad rumour can cause a crash in the market, then the asset is not a very safe asset hoard now is it? So that would make it a very risky asset to hold instead of a safe one. You are kind of working against your own position there.


Of course that percentage has been pulled out of thin air. I don't know what the right reward should be and you don't know it either. The market is what will determine the correct risk-reward ratio.


Of course. And I would have much more money available for investing, if the cost of living wasn't getting so much more expensive year by year.

And high volatility on the other hand dis-encourages hoarding, so it's a self balancing system. If it becomes volatile, people "hoard" less, which makes it again less volatile. Problem solved.

I'm not saying that this particular situation didn't have plenty of attention. It was more of a general statement. Changing bitcoin is hard. You seem to admit it in your later point when you write: 


And I'm saying conservatism is a very important bitcoin feature. Just like the original conservatism (not talking about modern day neo-cons) would have done the US a lot of good, but now the republic has been completely lost to an unconstitutional social democracy.


Are you against people talking to other people in order to convince them of their view? Aren't you doing the exact same thing with me right now?


I saw it with my own eyes. Reasoned posts getting -20 points in a matter of minutes is not normal r/bitcoin behaviour. 


They can only speak for themselves of course. I bet they meant that they were not doing any such attacks. How could they even know if a node that you are running gets attacked?


If they did not stop the situation that was going on, I think XT might have won. I was certainly firmly in the big blocks camp during that time. I'm really happy social pressure did not cause hasty decision during that time. If hard handed moderation was necessary to stop a manipulative attack, then so be it. It will result in a stronger ecosystem in the long run, as people will spread to alternative discussion platforms. I am not in favor of having single points of failure, so I am very happy about the alternative forums and subscribe to both r/btc and r/bitcoin_uncesored. So far I like r/bitcoin the best, but I'm glad there are alternatives.


Well again, maybe it's good that it changed sooner rather than later? Now competitors have a better possibility of catching up.


I own 150 domain names. Orgs are not nearly as valuable as coms. I won't even touch most orgs. I also have nothing against profit. Quite the contrary: I think profit is an indication of added value to inputs of labor, materials and land, which makes it a moral good.


Sorry about ignoring it. I just don't find it relevant. I also don't think companies can sue for domain names. There is the case in which Microsoft forget to renew hotmail.co.uk for example:
"A spokeswoman for Nominet UK - the registry for all .uk domains - confirmed that hotmail.co.uk had failed to be renewed and was placed back into pool of available domains. For Nominet's part, she confirmed that "all the standard renewal procedures were followed regarding hotmail.co.uk". "I would like to remind companies and their agents that it is their responsibility to renew their domains," she said.


Really? Do you in general think competition is unfair unless the competing companies were started the same day? MySpace was much earlier than facebook, but who is using it now?


If that is a substantial argument, isn't it an equally substantial argument if regular bitcoin nodes are DDOSed? Do those two "substantial arguments" then not pretty much counter each other?


So is that a false claim then? Is Theymos a core developer or forced to do what they command?


It is, if small blocks are considered as potential weakness of the system.


I will just use the old saying here: "You are known by the company you keep". I think there is a lot of truth in that saying.


I got the impression it relates to the overall growth in transactions, not just a short spam period. Where do you get your impression from?


Clearly the price is not correlating to the huge increase in transactions:


Can you explain to me what you mean by "market manipulation"? Are all players in the market not simply trying to make as much money as possible?


Because bitcoin is not a democracy, the miners are not voters and developers are not politicians?


I think the only comment that is needed here is that the bitcoin ecosystem is not just the miners. They are not voters in a democracy. I'm personally really happy about that. To quote myself from an older post:
"My workplace is not a democracy which I'm happy about. My home is not a democracy which I'm happy about. Bitcoin is not a democracy which I'm happy about. My country is a democracy and it has been absolutely ruined."


Do you believe they have bad intentions for bitcoin? Did you know for example that the blockstream employees get payed in timelocked bitcoins? Which gives them every incentive to take care of the long term value of bitcoin.

Everything you put on the blockchain will stay there forever. Should such a truth machine really be used to record every single coffee transaction of everyone in the world? Is that really a situation in which truth is in greater demand than speed?


That's a pretty poisonous statement. Let's not forget that the central bankers rule via the force of violent threat. Bitcoin is voluntary and open source. Don't like it, don't use it.

@_date: 2016-03-08 12:44:14
Full blocks only happened because of a spam attack. A fee market is the best way to fight against such spam. 
To run an efficient full node with 1mb blocks, you need to a have an internet connection with 2.1 mb upload speed. How many people have such connections available? I know I don't and I live in a big city in Finland. If you double the blocks, you need even more upload speed. Sounds like a disaster from a centralization standpoint to me.
@_date: 2016-03-21 16:28:53
How would you possibly know that?
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:23:49


Wrong. The hash rate needs to be big enough to make attacks too expensive. It does not need to grow, and has not always grown.


Why would the hash rate growth be multiplied with energy costs? The energy costs of mining will always be closely tied to the income of the miners. If the miners earn $1 000 000 /day then that's roughly the amount of energy costs they are willing to pay before having to turn their miners off. The energy consumption rate will only keep growing if the reward that the miners receive keep growing. Which it wont do unless bitcoin grows in value for all eternity.


Again, saying that the costs are ever increasing is making a very weird assumption: that miners are willing to mine at a loss. Obviously the amount of electricity tied to mining has a strong correlation with the price of bitcoin. Don't you think there will be a point of equilibrium?
@_date: 2016-03-28 09:36:17


Well there was also silver and copper.


Unless there is a coin with broader mass appeal that wins over a critical mass. Let's not forget how tiny the bitcoin adoption percent is from the world's population at the moment. Don't get me wrong, I'm long bitcoin, but it don't think it is a slam dunk case by any means.


I don't believe this statement is true. A coin can not at the same time be two opposing things. For example, a coin can not have both a deflationary and inflationary distribution curve. Many mainstream people are convinced that inflationary money is better. Not me, but the mainstream has that view. A coin can also not both be 100% anonymous and a 100% transparent. If bitcoin becomes anonymous, there will be a separate market for non-anonymous coins and vice versa.


Like I said, bitcoin can't adopt opposite properties. It can't become a square circle.


Languages have had a network effect for thousands of years, yet there are still hundreds of different languages in use. Many people speak both English and their native language. Similarly I think many people will interact both with the bitcoin network and other networks of their choosing. We can also look at coding languages. Why is the whole world not using C because of it's early network  effect?


Then how do you explain that historically there used to be many different currencies inside the United States? The government had to step in and stop that by force.

It wasn't the question if you care or don't care about that. The question was if gold has been the most consistent store of value during known history and you made a failed attempt to attack that easily verifiable claim. In the meanwhile the value of every single fiat currency has eventually gone to zero.


 
Yes, a store of value can be stolen. It doesn't mean it's not a store of value.


Then why are you making judgements on whether a certain ROI percentage is deserved or not? I haven't described any illegal activities and there certainly isn't anything illegal in getting a good return of investment.


You are completely ignoring the other half of the equation, which is just as important. Let's look at an example if it makes it easier for you to understand:
You bought Apple stocks back in the day when nobody believed in the company. Apple used your investment and became a company who produces incredible products with massive value to the society. Thus the stock value increased 100 x. Do you "deserve" your 100 x increase in your wealth? Absolutely. The market has determined that the value derived from your investment has been enormous and you are rewarded accordingly. Without your faith in the company and the early investment, there might not be all the Apple products consumers love so much. You did everyone a favor.


What an ignorant statement. Argumentum Ad Populum.


And how is it any different if I invest in bitcoin instead of a car rental store? Am I for some strange reason not entitled to my "proper share of profits" if I choose to invest in a new innovative currency instead of a car rental store? Sounds like a double standard if that's the case.
You are also trying to sidetrack the analogy, which was obviously about having a claim to societal resources (money) and deciding not to claim those resources (by saving). In the example I had a claim to ten of your cars, and I decided not to use that claim. That freed up the resources in question for serving you and other people. I still haven't heard a good answer from you why that would be a bad thing.


My argument is that deflationary money is good for people, especially regular people, who don't have extra income available to buy stock or other hedges against inflation. I also argue that deflation is the natural way of things in a free market, because we humans become better at production every single year. The natural tendency is for everything to become cheaper, but the fruits of our increasing productivity are getting robbed by the elite through inflation every single year. You have bought into their propaganda and act as an apologist to one of the biggest scams in human history.

So do you really think bitcoin is well suited for on-chain coffee purchases? Could it possibly be that bitcoin will never be a great solution for small and quick purchases that don't really require much trust, because other systems can handle those purchases very well, and layers built on top of bitcoin will be able to handle them very well too. 
Just ask yourself, does it make sense to store such insignificant pieces of information for all eternity. Does that sound like a good and necessary system to you?  


Really? Can you explain to me how bitcoin could ever be more convenient for purchasing a cup of coffee, than Visa? Let's not forget the 10 minute confirmation, which in itself hints of settlement types of uses. 10 minutes is not bad for settlement, but it is terrible for a cup of coffee.

Nope. I'm simply testing if you are consistent in what you say. You did write:
 
"the argument "if you don't like it, you can get out", or "no one forced you to be here" is a non argument, and in a sense idiotic and basically immoral, not only when it comes to bitcoin, but for any situation actually."
Seems like you don't agree with your own writings and that you are confused about your principles. That's fine by me of course.


Interesting claim! Let's find out! You said that telling someone to "get out if they don't like it" is immoral "for any situation". I showed you a situation that satisfies those conditions. How was that "extremely invalid"?

I understand your desire for having the properties of bitcoin stay consistent. But the good news are that this is a free market, so we don't have to worry.

Saying that greed is the cause of the problem is like saying hunger is the cause of starvation.

Right, just like the nazis were "national socialists" and not full socialists. That's like saying it's okay to have cancer if you just have a little bit of it.

Are you an authority on Satoshi's vision? I think he gave us a pretty good hint what bitcoin is about in the genesis block message.


Bitcoin is simply not ready for mass adoption yet. I'm sorry if that doesn't suit your desire to get rich quick. This is a long ride. You need to be a bit patient.


Which they can do because it's decentralized. If the only ones capable of running full nodes are big financial institutions, then it's not peer to peer money anymore. We are right back to trusting the big institutions Satoshi was so skeptical of.


Because it doesn't make sense from an information theory standpoint. And what is your response for the very simple fact that waiting for blockchain confirmation times when buying a cup of coffee makes no sense anyway?


No you won't. Someone has to always have a copy of the entire ledger. That's just how it works. Maybe this is the most important reason why we have such a difference in opinion? Please study this issue a bit more. I have never heard any developer say that someone wouldn't have store the entire blockchain for bitcoin to work.

Correct me if I'm wrong but it sounds to me like bail-ins are much more market oriented than bail-outs.

Of course security exists to varying degrees. I prefer not to go alone to bad neighborhoods at night. Statistically I'm more likely to get in trouble there than when I go to my shop during daytime. I also avoid very drunk people. Statistically most violence in my country is inflicted by drunk persons. When I'm in a car, I use the seat belt.  Of course there is no perfect security. But there are varying degrees of it and you should strive to stay as safe as possible without sacrificing too much of your life in the process.

Somalia is about as close to an ancap paradise as exists on the planet today. Just about everything has been appropriated for private control, and there is hardly even a state to speak of.
Your ignorance is really starting to show here. I don't think you actually know that much about Somalia. Here's a quick timeline:
1. The socialist take over in 1969
2. Like always with socialist countries, it collapses completely twenty years later in 1991
3. The Transitional National Government (TNG) is established in 2000, followed by the formation of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004
4. The Federal Government of Somalia is established in 2012
Somalia is so low on the index of economic freedom, it doesn't even get a rank. It has an average IQ of 68. They do have a government and they don't adhere to the non-aggression principle.

You must understand that no regulation at all is ever needed, only contracts between different parties. When two parties make a voluntary contract, it's by definition a win-win situation (otherwise the contract would not be agreed upon). Win-win situations obviously lead to many positive things like the creation of wealth for example.
When you introduce government regulations, you bring a gun into the equation. Two parties are no longer free to negotiate the contract they would otherwise voluntary negotiate. If they do a contract that's against the rules of the gun holder (the government) then they know that force will be escalated against them until they either comply or die.
Your position seems to be that it's better to use the threat of violence to meddle in contracts two parties want to voluntarily create. My problem with your position is that it stops win-win situations from happening by stopping contracts entirely in some situations or turning them into win-lose situations in others. Less wealth is now created and everyone is worse off. That's why it's so absurd to suggest that more regulation (more violence) is somehow good for countries. Not only is regulation no good since it destroys wealth, it's also immoral, since it's the use of force against peacefully acting people.

The issue is that you need to upload the latest block in less than 30 seconds in order for the network to work properly. That's why an efficient node currently needs 2.1MB/s upload speed with 1MB blocks.


Well let's just imagine a world in which all the nodes are being run by big, centralized institutions like banks. Don't you think that creates the perfect attack vector for say the NSA, which can simply knock on the door of these institutions and make sure they comply with whatever desires the government has regarding the bitcoin network? Likely outcomes would be things like blacklists, KYC etc.


The same way Mike Hearn tried to add blacklists.


You are right about this. But Hearn did try, together with Gavin. Thank god the ecosystem rejected XT. It would maybe not have killed bitcoin alltogether but it would likely have caused nasty hard forks between liberty minded people and people who simply want mass adoption and moon, no matter what the cost.


To be fair I did not equate those two things, I just said that it's a sign of good health that changes to bitcoin are difficult to make and require fierce debates. The opposite of that would be that people can just change the protocol without anyone paying attention. That would be truly dangerous.


Then why were they not signalling this preference with actual software choices?


I agree that percentages are not the key point here. For me, the key is the choice in the matter. If I can run a full node from my home, in case there are bad actors in the network and I want to be 100% sure about the state of blockchain, I should be able to do so.


I agree, bitcoin is open source and is free for anyone to use and modify.


This doens't matter. Domain names are not public domain. They can't be. Someone is going to own it. Satoshi new this. He clearly trusted the individuals he gave the domain to. Another sign of confidence towards them.


Which he has already done and we are on it right now.


Are we not having an independent and fair discussion about bitcoin right now? Also, should the moderators do nothing when everyone can see that there are concetrated attacks and vote brigading going on? During the most recent attack, high quality pro core posts were voted down to -20 or more in a matter of minutes. Should Theymos just sit back and allow such obvious manipulation attacks in his own house? I don't think so.
The bottomline here is that you act like it's the combination of letters in the name that matter, instead of the actual content. That bitcoin.org is just such a great domain name that it gives the owners of it an unfair advantage. But I don't believe that's the case (not that it would bother me if it was). There is for example bitcoin.com which is a much better domain name than any .org and that one is owned by Roger Ver who is pro big blocks. So that camp already has very good domains and subreddits, It's not our fault if people prefer communication platforms with different policies.


Then you should drop this point. It's also not like standard bitcoin nodes are DDOS free. So this doesn't help the discussion in any way.


It's still easy enough that the miners did it when GHash was getting too big.
When I'm debating someone, I always like to take a look if they have skipped any major points that I made, because those areas are usually the most difficult ones to defend. I would like to ask for your commentary on the clear evidence, that Mike Hearn was a government installation. Does it not worry you, that you are likely supporting similar changes to bitcoin that the US government were pushing?
 
Also, earlier you made calculations about how full the blocks are going to get if the network is growing at the same speed as before. Well the core team has been investigating the reasons for this growth and it seems like there are long chains of dust transactions that simply end up to the original sender later. Which is a very clear sign of an attack/spam. It is very much possible that the transaction growth is mainly a result of that and bigger blocks would only make it worse. If there is real adoption growth, why is the price not growing in tandem with the transaction growth? This is a key question.


Absolutely. This discussion has been a very positive experience for me and wish more discussions would work like this, where points get addressed in a calm manner without the need for personal attacks.

If by investment vehicle we mean something that is designed to hold it's value or go up in value then I would of course argue that is exactly what bitcoin is.


Bitcoin is also designed to provide a constant rate of return simply by being deflationary. Capitalism, when left to it's own devices is deflationary by nature (let me know if you need me to explain this further).


Saying that bitcoin is a currency is like saying the internet is email. While it shares some qualities with currencies, it's something fundamentally new and different.


I think the opposite is true. The more people decide to hold bitcoin instead of giving it to others as currency, the more it will gain in value. It will make bitcoin extremely wanted, but also extremely difficult to amass. Then all we need is the law of supply and demand.

The number one libertarian rule is the non-aggression principle. Can you explain how any kind of taxation is compatible with that?
@_date: 2016-06-23 07:52:02


When you are rooting for regulation, you are basically saying the following:
"Let's have a special group of people (the government) who have special rights to dictate what kind of contracts other people can make. Let's also give them a special right to use violence over peacefully acting people"
How does that become a good idea in your mind? Are these people whom you so willingly hand these special rights to, somehow more moral or ethical than the average people? I would even argue that the opposite is true: power attracts the wrong kind of people; those who want to dominate over others. We see this play out over and over again in history where governments eventually start murdering their own people.


So what? Any act of aggression would be defended against. What you are saying is that because some people might act violently, let's create a special group of people that have the right to not only act violently, but to initiate violence against peacefully acting people. That doesn't make much sense to me.


 So you are okay to support a monopoly on violence, as long as it's "efficient"? Do you really even think the regulation we have today makes thing more efficient? Regulation creates endless bureaucracy which is the polar opposite of any kind of efficiency. People spend endless hours filing paperwork instead of actually producing goods and services.

Well ordered does not equal regulated. Order can be achieved through many means. Regulation is achieved through the threat of violence.
The metrics the foundation uses are very clear. Like I quoted, the less there is government regulation, the higher a country ranks. 
We have seen the regulation scheme play out over and over again in history: countries that are most free like Switzerland or the early United States become economic powerhouses and great places to live. Countries that are least free become places like North Korea, East Germany and communist China (before it embraced capitalism). I'm really curious how you can look at that evidence and conclude that regulations are good. It's like saying "sure, cancer will kill you if you let it grow too big, but a little bit of cancer is good for you." 
This brings to mind how you never addressed the arguments I made regarding win-win and win-lose situations. Do you see how voluntary actions are by default win-win situations?
Another point against regulation is this: you might think that you are somehow limiting what corporations can do with regulations. The truth is that it's those very same corporations that write the regulations in the first place. They have endless money to lobby for favorable regulations, their experts are the ones forming the actual texts and the return of investment for lobbying is absolutely amazing.  When you hand governments more power to regulate, you're directly handing more power to the megacorps. They love it, and use it to create barriers to entry for any potential competitors. You are in practice giving corporations access to violent government power.


Sense from who's perspective? Having competing energy solutions is certainly beneficial for the consumer.

Likewise I'm very happy to see consumer solar panels competing with electric companies. Aren't you?

The only contradiction here is calling yourself a libertarian while not adhering to the number one libertarian principle; the non-aggression principle. You are not a libertarian if you don't adhere to it. Find another word to describe yourself, because "left-libertarian" just makes you look funny.


So we need a group of people with special rights to murder, kidnap, torture and steal in order to not have our property rights violated? Can't you see how ridiculous that sounds?


You are essentially saying that there can be no property rights. Since all natural resources belong to no one, and all property comes from natural resources, no property rights can exist.
So now you are breaking a second essential libertarian principle; the right to property. Are you serious?

I'm curious why you think it's ranked individually in the world economic freedom index? The answer is of course that Hong Kong is basically a Chinese experiment in what happens when you give an area economic freedom. It's very different from mainland China, with different rules, and that's why it has a separate rank in the list. It's actually a great example for proving my point: economic freedom makes a country flourish. Hong Kong is doing better than mainland China on every imaginable metric.


Then why is it that the countries which are on the bottom of the economic freedom list tend to be the worst places on earth? If socialism is so great for a country, why have all socialist countries gone straight down the drain so quickly? Venezuela used to be a rich country you know? All it took to destroy it's wealth was socialism. Now the people are out pillaging and plundering the stores. Business as usual in a socialist country of course.
Let me also point out that socialist institutions have never built anything. They have stolen money from others via taxation, and then used that money to pay workers in order to have them build infrastructure.

So are you saying that regulation makes running a business more easy? But the index of economic freedom gives negative points for regulation. The countries with a lot of regulation are low in the index. You are trying to twist that around. But the facts remain:
1. Countries with low regulation get better scores at the economic freedom index (that's one of the key metrics they use)
2. The countries that you listed are both terrible places to live and list poorly in the index
3. Thus it is very clear that the more you regulate, the worse your country will do. That's no surprise since regulation always uses the threat of violence to hinder voluntary win-win trading activity. 
Every time when a country is divided into a more regulated and a less regulated entity, then less regulated entity wins big time. Examples:
China vs Hong Kong
North Korea vs South Korea

Can you see how you are now moving the goal post? I have nothing against standards, in fact I love having standards. Especially moral standards. Standards are not the same thing as regulation. No violence is necessary when agreeing upon standards and they fit perfectly in any free market system.


No it's not. If it doesn't have the monopoly on force on a specific geographical area, it's not a government. By definition.


I already showed you how voluntary contracts create win-win situations while forced contracts create win-lose situations. I would like you to address that somehow. What are these efficiencies you talk about that supposedly rise from win-lose situations? They must be pretty magnificent since they trump win-win situations. 


I don't want governance. The word itself implies that we divide people into two classes: those who are allowed to govern and those who are to be governed. Why should there be such a distinction? I thought you guys believe in equality between human beings.


It's good that you at least acknowledge that your position has no moral ideology behind it. But I will attack it on a purely utilitarian basis as well. You say that we need to have violent leaders in order to avoid having other violent leaders. I see no need for violence at all. Violence is very expensive and very inefficient.


The only model that history has consistently shown to be costly for humans is the one where people give up their rights and let the governments become too strong. That's when hundreds of millions of people start top get murdered. Let's just say that I'm willing to take my changes with the free market. How many people have private companies murdered against these hundreds of millions?

This drop was long time in the making. Bitcoin almost always eventually corrects long bull runs, often the retrace is 40-50%.
I was expecting it, and getting more and more nervous when it didn't happen. The markets simply needed a proper scare to temporarily get out of the greed mode. The DAO hack and the Bitfinex downtime provided enough fear to finally give us the retrace.

Everything you said there applies equally to both rape and property. You say that property is a concept, a social convention. But deeming rape bad is also a concept and a social convention. I support both concepts equally: rape is immoral and violating property rights also is immoral.
Anyway, the biggest problem with your response to my rape analogy was that you clearly didn't understand the point of it: I'm showing how absurd it is to want to prevent rape by giving a special group the rights to rape. You want to prevent the violation of property rights by giving a special group the right to violate property rights. Forget get the rape analogy for a second. Can't you see how absurd your position is, when you want to prevent property violations by creating a special class of people whom you grant the right to violate property? That is perfectly analogous to preventing murder by allowing some people to murder freely or preventing rape by allowing some people to rape freely.


This will always be the case in any free society, and here is the shocking part: there is nothing wrong with that. People get rich by giving others equal or greater value and they should be allowed to enjoy the fruits of all that value they have given others. The only way to prevent this from happening is a totalitarian communist system.


Would you buy services from such a security company? Consumers actually hold a great deal of power, since they can vote with their wallets. A bad actor quickly loses market share. Also, companies don't become big by serving the richest people; every big company out there has made their fortune by selling to the masses. Acting in a bad manner towards the middle class would be a really bad move from a security company. Companies are accountable at a whole different level than governments. When George W Bush who was in charge of the security of Americans allowed 9/11 to happen, did he lose money or "market share"? No, he was greatly rewarded with more money, more rights and more support. If a private company messes up like that, they get bankrupt, not rewarded.


Are you seriously telling me that it's just an opinion that property rights and NAP are core libertarian principles? Then please explain to me what libertarianism actually means to you. Why are you eager to call yourself a libertarian? What is the attraction?


There is authority to do that: each individual is free to organize the protection of their property any way they see fit, as long as they don't violate the property of others in the process. Some might even have a private army for the job. 


I'd much rather have corporations in control of things than government. The worst thing a company can do to you is offer you goods and services. You are free to say no. This doesn't work with governments, they don't take no for an answer. In the entire history of the world, how many people do you think corporations have murdered? Governments have murdered hundreds of millions. I'll take my chances with corporations.


There will always be inequality and there is nothing wrong with inequality. If you are not free to be unequal or exceptional or otherwise different, you are not free at all. Is freedom a value for you?


They will defend it themselves and with the help of security organizations. Why would a central authority be needed?

This chapter from their website explains their view very clearly, and it's nothing like what you are claiming:


Business Freedom. Business freedom is about an individual’s right to establish and run an enterprise without undue interference from the state. Burdensome and redundant regulations are the most common barriers to the free conduct of entrepreneurial activity. By increasing the costs of production, regulations can make it difficult for entrepreneurs to succeed in the marketplace.

Yeah, I actually had a small amount of sympathy for her before this move.
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:44:32


That is all good and well. But you kind of avoided the point entirely with that answer. Why would the best way to preserve property be to give a special group of people the right to violate property? It's like saying "in order to avoid rape, we need to have people who have the right to rape others". Doesn't make any sense.


Well let's say some asshole steals my television. My security organization will go to his house and ask for a voluntary house search. The asshole refuses. My security organization now contacts the asshole's security organization and demands they cooperate. His organization contacts the asshole and tells him that in his contract he has agreed to help in solving such disputes. If the asshole doesn't cooperate, his own security organization ends the contract with him. He has now zero security. Because other companies will be vary of someone not belonging to any security organization and thus being dangerous to society, they will also terminate all contracts with him. The asshole will now be stranded on his own piece of property, without access to electricity, water, food or travel. Now was stealing a television really worth it for him?


People also talk about round circles. Doesn't make it any less of a contradictory term.
Saying left-libertarian is like saying "atheist christian" or "communist capitalist". They are valid words, but don't make sense when used together. You have the burden of proof to explain why I should accept you being a libertarian when you contradict both of the most important libertarian principles (NAP and property rights). I would imagine I would have a similar burden of proof if I would claim to be an atheist while also saying that I believe in divinity of Jesus.


This is simply not what we libertarians believe. Libertarians believe in property rights which necessarily include the right to own land and other natural resources. 
I'm kind of curious: since you reject the most important aspects of libertarianism, what is it that you think that actually resonates with you in libertarianism? You sound more like a minarchist to me.

Forget Somalia for a moment since it's not even listed. Do you recognize that the number 1. country Hong Kong has much less regulation compared to China which is ranked 144? Or that Switzerland (4th) has far less regulation and a smaller government compared to Venezuela (ranked 176)? Do you recognize any kind of correlation between the amount of regulation or size of government with the placement in this list for countries? 


Good luck with that. The Gilen's flatline study already showed us that your wishes carry almost zero weight regarding what legislation get's passed. Even if you would represent a majority (which unfortunately you don't regarding this issue). Democracy doesn't work. The US was wildly successful because it was a republic. Now that it's more like a democracy, everything is up for grabs for the politicians. In my personal life there is zero democratic decision making and my relationships are great. I wish world would wake up the mass illusion that democracy is somehow a great system. How many successful companies run like democracies? Probably none.
It seems like you understand very well that by giving support to more regulation, you are essentially giving support to mega corporations and their desire to create barriers to entry for their competition. How does this realization not stop you from supporting more regulation?


Silly from who's perspective? Certainly not the consumers, as it would increase competition. You could with the same logic say that it's equally silly and wasteful to build two grocery stores in the same village. Yet there I think you would recognize why competition is good and necessary.

All work is performed for pure capitalistic motives: to gain resources. Nothing wrong with that.


That's not why I think you have a problem with understanding capitalism. It's in your title like I said earlier.

So basically you would need a one world government, which sounds like hell on earth to me. 
On a deeper level I oppose your ideology on the basis that it goes against the number one libertarian rule: The non-aggression principle. Taxing corporations and limiting free trade is the use of force against peacefully acting individuals and is thus not only incompatible with libertarianism but utterly immoral as well.

Legal infrastructure is not the same thing as regulation. I'm sure I don't have to explain the difference to you.


Why would that be the case? In a free society the use of aggression would only be allowed for self defense. That's a pretty big difference from actively threatening peacefully acting people with violence.


Enforcement of contracts is not at all the same thing as regulation.
I also don't understand why you are rooting for a monopoly on law and violence. Is your view in general that monopolies are a positive thing from the consumers perspective? Usually the people who defend regulation also view monopolies as dangerous. Yet they vigorously defend the only true monopolies that exist: the government's monopoly on violence and law.

I feel like the timing of the stock market crash was quite unfortunate for bitcoin: if we would still have been in a bitcoin bull market, I'm pretty sure the stock market collapse would have boosted it further. It just happened that bitcoin was moving into a bear market because of the divide in the community, right when the stocks started to dive. Maybe investors falsely took that as a sign of correlation which is now getting reinforced. On the surface level, money escaping traditional stocks should definitely be good for bitcoin and gold.

I would like to hear your answer to these two simple questions:
1. Why should Germany not worry about the competition from China? We have seen how many countries have lost their manufacturing jobs to China because their wages have gone up. Germany is one of the few countries who has been able to defend at least some of it's manufacturing jobs against Asia.

I understand your position perfectly well. I'm just taking it to it's logical conclusion. You want to blame germany for deciding to produce quality goods for low wages.

Well what you subsidize you increase. Good luck with that approach. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:55:21
In essence you are coming from a point of view where individuals are just too stupid to adjust their wage demands so let's instead have governments control the money. Like we haven't seen how that ends up. The nice thing about capitalism is that it rewards rationality and punishes irrationality. So as a worker I can rationally accept that I might in some situations need to settle for a lower wage to keep my job (unless my skill set is in high demand) or not accept it and get fired or have the business simply quit. In that system the power is in the hands of individual actors, instead of politicians and central bankers. A free market is so much better at fixing problems like sticky wages compared to corruptible politicians and their currency manipulation games.
I would also like to point out, how your suggestion (floating government controlled currency) punishes everyone alike, rational or irrational. My suggestion (free market capitalism combined with a world wide trustless ledger) will reward rational actors and punish irrational actors. I for one believe incentives matter. If you subsidize irrational actions, you will see more of them. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:23:42


That's because economic actions do have moral qualities. For example forcing other people to pay for your expenses is immoral. You moralize economics just the same by assigning moral responsibilities to the Germans. It's like you expect that the germans to say something like this "Gee, we are too good at what we do and others have a hard time competing. Why don't we stop being so good so that others can compete with us again." Can you really imagine such a conversation? :D
I don't think you really understand capitalism to be frank. I'm a business owner and thinking that I would EVER say something like "I should become less efficient to let the competition catch up" is utterly ridiculous. It's not my job to worry about the competition. My job is to worry about my business. Who's to say when the germans are "bad enough" at producing? If they become more expensive, then China will outcompete them. I think Germany should worry more about Chinese people outperforming them than some country being worse than them. You seem to cheer for a race to the bottom.


Yes, just like the bank manager doesn't have to make concessions when I have not paid my debts to the bank. Let's imagine You as the bank manager for a second. Should I be able to force you to give me more loans after not paying back the previous ones? Can't you see how absurd that is?

The last time we had an ATH no news organizations, banks or wall street guys took bitcoin seriously. Things are very different now.

The fundamentals are very different from the last rally.

And money is the best objective measure of value we have come up with. I have a hard time just taking someone's word on whether someone else "deserves" something or not. The default position should be that money that was received through voluntary exchange in an non-coercive environment has been well earned.
Now of course the medical industry and the state enforced patent system is far from non-coercive which is the only thing that makes price gouging possible in the first place.

There are far cheaper and better alternatives for those use cases than gold. Can you name a single application in which gold is absolutely essential and can not be substituted for anything else? l'm sure we would both agree that the overwhelming majority portion of gold's price is related to it's use as a store of value and hedge against inflation.


There is no such thing as "intrinsic value". All value is subjective, by definition. Put someone on a deserted island made out of gold and ask them about the "intrinsic value" of it.


I agree with the first part. The thing you get wrong is that when there are less transactions, it's actually easier and cheaper to transact. Someone who values the ease of bitcoin transactions, should not wish for a clogged network with full blocks. So holding helps in that sense too.


Maybe, but not much.


I'm comparing two stores of value with limited supply, so the comparison is completely valid.

Absolutely. But while the system is what it is, then I understand why companies lobby. It's the same thing with taxes; I feel like the government is using my tax money to do some very immoral things like mass surveillance and warfare. But I'm still going to pay my taxes, because I don't want to be locked in a tiny cell for the rest of my life. Does that make me immoral?

@_date: 2016-02-18 18:12:14


Yes, I understand the question we are discussing.


Really? The block size debate has been a great sign of strength from the bitcoin community. It has demonstrated how amazingly hard it is to change the fundamental properties of bitcoin. And that's exactly what makes it secure.    And once again, the fundamental difference when compared to the fed is that one system is voluntary and the other one is forced upon people with threats of violence. It's like comparing love making to rape.


If this is so clear, then where is the data to back it up? Adoption has been growing faster than the price for a long time now. They have even gone in opposite directions. So where can we see this clarity you speak of?


Again, what data do you have for this claim? Has the price risen great amounts and permanently after several major companies have adopted bitcoin? Or are we kind of close to the situation which we had already years ago price wise? I have noticed you like to make a lot of claims and rarely back them up with anything tangible.


So your theory is that the number of merchants accepting a currency is what makes it valuable? Then how do you explain places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela? Every single merchant in those countries accept their currencies, yet they are almost worthless. Seems to me like the value of the currency is tied to something else than merchant adoption.

I'm not ignoring anything, I'm simply pointing out that the free market has a solution for this. If a business becomes uncompetitive, it goes out of business. Problem solved.


Where did I argue against it? I simply pointed out that the free market already has a solution for businesses that are no longer competitive. In your model currency is used to as a tool to keep those who are inferior at producing a certain good, in business. In my model, the goods are produced by those who are superior at producing them. I guess I'm an idiot for wanting production to be handled by those who are best at it.


If my boss told me I can either take a small pay cut or I will lose my job completely and get replaced by cheaper labor, I will take the pay cut (if there are no better positions available in other companies). How is that not personal utility maximization and a rational choice?


Nobody is binding anyone to anything. Money is simply a ledger. Or that's how it should ideally work (bitcoin). With a universal ledger, no one can devalue their currency so there are no currency manipulation games to be played. When no one else is playing such games, you don't have to do it either. The problem with euro is not that it's a shared currency. The problem is that the number one rule of the euro was not followed, which states clearly "no bailouts". Let the free market do it's job.

Really? So if a person is on a concentration camp, would he be immoral to pay taxes to the authorities running the camp? And if the camp leaders decided to let the prisoners vote for simple things like more food, would it be immoral to participate in that vote?


And when giant corporations lobby for government favors in order to minimize their taxes, how are they not doing the exact same thing?


I think we can be fairly confident that the Koch brothers are still net payers to the system, so in that sense they are only minimizing their tax burden by getting some it back through handouts.


I have a hard time seeing anything immoral in supporting think tanks. Not that I really care about think tanks myself, but if someone wants to support it, feel free to. It doesn't involve any coercion.


You are moving the goalpost though, the original argument was a about thieves and robbers.
SInce you focused on Koch brothers, let's see how they have actually made their fortunes:
"Koch companies are involved in core industries such as the manufacturing, refining, and distribution of petroleum, chemicals, energy, fiber, intermediates and polymers, minerals, fertilizers, pulp and paper, chemical technology equipment, ranching, finance, commodities trading, and other ventures and investments."
That's right, they have made their fortunes by creating and selling useful things to the masses. Thieves and robbers do not create useful things to anyone. That's quite a difference in my view.

Well speaking out against Nazis would probably have gotten you and your family destroyed. You would have sacrificed the people you love for the sake of strangers. There was also no guarantee that your resistance would have done anyone any good. Maybe the maximum contribution of good in the world still came from a German being a good father/mother/friend. So I'm willing to say that the Germans did not have a moral obligation to sacrifice what they loved for the sake of strangers. With Americans it's of course a bit different; one can speak against the system without being killed. But not paying your taxes puts you in a tiny box for the rest of your life. I would not demand such a sacrifice from anyone. But yes certainly, I have no problems saying that it's a complex matter. I tend to lean towards there being no positive moral obligations though.


No, I'm saying that I will be thrown in a tiny cell if I don't pay my taxes.


I'm not sure which one of my statements would warrant such a conclusion. My position would be more like if they pay 5bn in taxes, getting 1bn of that back through lobbying is not immoral.


I'm not sure lobbying automatically increases the size of the government. One can lobby for tax breaks for example.


Don't get me wrong, I think that system is highly problematic. But the Koch brothers are simply competitors in that unfortunate game and they need to do their best to compete with other players, doing what ever the rules allow them to do. The problem is not the Koch brothers, it is the fact that the government has the power to redistribute wealth in such radical ways in the first place.


I don't understand your position here. If someone pays you to think for solutions to problems, how is that automatically propaganda and manipulation? And if one honestly views the world in a certain way, is it somehow wrong to try to improve the world in the ways you best deem fit coming from that world view?


I never claimed that. I simply claimed that most rich people in the world became wealthy by giving the masses something that they wanted. We keep talking about the Koch family, but surely the origin of their wealth was in trading. Maybe they are doing questionable things like lobbying now that they are already wealthy, but I'm sure you would have to agree that they could not really do any lobbying before they first became wealthy through the market?
Our conversation started when you said:


I would argue that you have not really been able to support that statement. Could you show me a single example of someone literally stealing and robbing their way from being broke to lasting wealth?

If I would be a central bank, here's what I would do:
1. Print money like always
2. Slowly buy bitcoin with dollars, then dump them all to cause panic in the market
3. Buy the coins back at a lower price, then dump them again for even less
4. Rinse and repeat
This would create a constant bear market and downwards pressure and you could probably drop the price to sub 100 with very little effort.
Then again, there are many long term believers who are in it also for ideological reasons. Your evil plan would get ruined if enough people still believed in the long term success of bitcoin to scoop up the cheap coins. But if there was a ten year constant bear market, how many of us would be left standing?

Sure one can disagree with intellectual property rights and I'm certainly not a fan of government lobbying. But those things are hardly in the categories of "stealing and robbing".

I believe you are mistaken here. Productivity growth has actually a deflationary (price deflation) effect, since the same amount of money is chasing an increased supply of goods. When more goods are produced in a more efficient manner, people's standard of living can go up without any wage raises, since the same wage can now buy more things. I'm sure you are aware, that it's actually inflation, not deflation, that is used as a basis for automatic salary increases. The reason why you might see wages go up in tandem with economic growth is because governments actually target inflation and thus economic growth allows them to steal more value by printing more money. Sans government money printing, economic growth would always result in price deflation.


I feel the exact same way; do you really think a good solution to the worlds economic problems is to suggest that some countries should become less competitive? Can't you see that by making economic actors being less productive, the whole world is worse off since less gets produced? It's impossible to accept such a solution, it goes against the very nature of progress seeking humans and principles of capitalism. I do appreciate the nice and friendly manner you are using to make your points though. Have an upvote for that!

What's immoral about investing in a company that produces cigarettes or armaments?
They seem to have a market demand. You are not initiating the use of force by producing them. If you say that cigarettes can be unhealthy, then you should not invest in any company that might have any potential negative effects on human beings. So wheat production, bakeries, soda factories, car producers, even Facebook and so on. And even if I would give you that cigarettes are always destructive, then why would it be immoral to sell them to someone who want's to act in a self destructive manner? Would it be immoral to sell a pain-free euthanasia device to someone who is in great pain and doesn't want to live anymore (and thus wants to be self destructive)?

I agree. But it's a value choice whether to favor those who pay for their living through credit or those who accumulate savings. I think it's a great moral hazard to encourage debt. Savings are in a sense a moral good: if you have saved a million dollars, it means that you have a one million claim towards society's resources, but you choose not to use those resources, leaving more goods and services available for everyone else. That's kind of nice of you.


That's a pretty big statement. Do you have something to support it? There are two ways to fund things; savings and debt. Can you show me why debt would in general be a better way than savings?


Oh yes, just like nobody buys computers or cellphones because their prices keep dropping...


If we talk about spirals, why don't we talk about the debt spiral. Do you seriously think any country on this planet will ever be able to pay back their debt? We both know that's just impossible and the system has been designed to make it impossible. There isn't even enough money in existence to pay back all the debt.


Does the misallocation of capital, caused by central planning, possibly have any part in this? Or policies like minimum wages? Does the historical data support your claim? Some of the biggest growth periods in history have been deflationary (in the times before central banking).


Listen to yourself. You want to make me believe, that falling prices of everything would be bad for regular people. That the world would be an awful place if we would get to keep the awards of our increased productivity and see our lives get easier to manage every year? That people could actually trust that their pensions will go up in value instead of down. That every year we would be a little bit better off, because every year we humans learn new skills and get better. Because that's what you are trying to convince me of, when you try to say that deflation is bad. I'm open for data, but it better be pretty damn good data.

Great post!
It clarified in my mind how it doesn't even make sense to want to record very small and quick purchases (like coffee) of the bitcoin blockchain. It will never be fast enough for that, and the balance between convenience and need for truth is not good in such use cases. Bitcoin is most useful where truth is most important and least useful where speed is most important. So small transactions that require fast speeds, should be recorded off-chain (lighting network for example or what 21inc is building).

It doesn't matter what the core promises. What matters is the product that they create. As a consumer of cryptocurrencies I can at any point exercise my freedom to invest in some other coin if I'm no longer happy with bitcoin. So what is the problem?

You didn't answer my question, in which I asked what a corporations has ever done to you specifically. This is what I predicted.


Oh I didn't know corporations force people to smoke.
Why stop there though? Restaurants are evil because they force people to become fat. Computer makers are evil because they force people sit down too much.
This is your logic, isn't it?


Taxation is the use of force. It's a form of economic rape. Slaves had to work the entire year for their masters. We only have to work 75% of the year for our masters. How wonderful.


While governments steal from, murder, kidnap and torture millions of people, directly affecting the persons and their families. See the "slight" imbalance in the scale?


Guess what was the single most polluting event in the century so far? That's right, the government attacking Iraq and Afganistan. There is no bigger polluter than the government war machine. Also, can a government somehow magically procude the same goods and services that corporations do, but without any pollution whatsoever? Or could it be that producing things will cause some pollution no matter who is doing it. Should we humans stop eating and starve to death because that would lessen CO2 emissions?

The problem with this interpretation is that no one uses the word like that. Again, by that standard absolutely everything would be a monopoly. Clearly that is not the meaning of the word, since it renders the word completely meaningless.


I want to use the most common interpretation of the word, which excludes individual brands. We care about the underlying category of goods and services, not any specific brands. So Heinz doesn't have a monopoly, as long as there are other brands of ketchup available in the US, which there will be, since the government doesn't stop people from producing different varieties of tomato sauce, but they will stop people for using the brand name of Heinz.


If a robber hides his gun in a bag so that you can't see it, is there no gun to your head? Is the situation morally okay, if the gun is only made visible if you refuse to comply?


No, but that's what will happen if I refuse to comply. If a mafia organization comes to my shop and makes it clear that I need to pay a protection racket or "accidents" might happen, am I wrong to think that they are threatening me with violence? You seem to think the gun needs to be visible. I'm saying that a believable threat of the gun is enough.


All I need to do to have a gun pointed at my head is to not pay taxes from my income. If I manage to do this with large enough sums so that it's worthwhile to the government thugs, they will absolutely send the police to drag me from my house.
Look at what happened to an example I'm sure we both are aware of: Graig Wright. A swat team swarmed to his house, because of the suspected tax evasion. 
Maybe you can answer this to make it more obvious:
If you tell a woman that unless she has sex with you, you will first send her warnings and then if she ignores those, you will come to her house with a gun in your pocket and if she fights back you will forcefully drag her with you, is that completely fine? After all, no gun was visible, so there was no violence in the situation? Clearly that would fall under the category of rape. Which is why taxation falls under the category of economic rape.

Alright, happy to do that. 


We can use the Wikipedia definition:
"A monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity"
I would add to that point that commonly it is enough for a monopoly to exist inside a country (meaning it doesn't help if some other country has competing suppliers). For example, many countries have a taxi monopoly, even though other countries obviously have taxis as well.


Yes, but only violently enforced government monopolies. A monopoly has never existed in a free or even relatively free market for a prolonged period of time (say more than a decade).


It is, since you are forced to use it by the government as the only means to pay your taxes. You are also not free to issue competing currency. The ones that have tried that all went to jail (for example the liberty dollar maker). The only reason Satoshi Nakamoto didn't end up in jail is that his identity is unknown. The only reason bitcoin hasn't been shut down is that it was specifically designed to resist such an attempt.


Bitcoin is not a monopoly for several reasons: firstly anyone can start a competing cryptocurrency or even directly just fork bitcoin. Secondly there are hundreds of competitors for bitcoin.

Right and I'm saying that letting the government grant a monopoly to the federal reserve, which is nothing but a cartel of private banks (and has the purpose of price fixing the most important price in the entire economy, the price of money itself), is like drinking a 50 gallon drum of water every day and expecting good things to come from it.
I'm sure you are one of those who think we need governments to protect us from "dangerous" monopolies forming in a free market (a phenomenon that has never actually been observed). Then you move right on to school us about the virtues of having a monopolized banking cartel running the entire economy.

Which is my point: monowheels could have a monopoly. They don't need to be mentioned separately in the definition of monopolies. Only if there would be some exception to the rule, it would have to be mentioned separately. Money is not mentioned separately, and it shouldn't be, because it clearly isn't an exception. And there is no reason why it should be an exception. We even have historical periods when there was competing money inside the US.


If they released a coin that would seriously try to compete with the US dollar, we both know it would get shut down very quickly. Just like they did with the liberty dollar: "On March 18, 2011, von NotHaus was pronounced guilty of "making, possessing, and selling his own currency"."


You keep bringing this up and ignore my replies to it. We both know that bitcoin was designed in the first place to be as difficult to shut down as possible. Satoshi Nakamoto hid his identity for a good reason. We have already seen the government trying to connect bitcoin to shady uses. If you think they won't try to fight it, regulate it or otherwise make it cumbersome to use, you are delusional.


Oh so I should take it as a fact now that "only batshit crazy people" include money as one of the possible forms of a monopoly? Alright, provide evidence that every single person that has talked about the government's monopoly on money is "batshit crazy". Or maybe it wasn't really a fact, but pure slander like I said.


No no, the analogy is much simpler. You support the forceful redistribution of wealth. What's different about the forceful redistribution of sexual access? I consider both actions immoral. For some weird reason, you only consider the latter immoral. Why?

All monopolies are bad for the consumer. Patents and copyrights are certainly not a free-market phenomena; they are another example of the government using force. In a free society both patents and copyrights would likely be done via contracts. You only get a product from a company if you agree contractually not to pirate it. I have no problem with people suing for breach of contract. But to give an answer to your question, no, I don't think patents and copyright are a monopoly, while I still view them mostly as negative things in their current form. The reason they are not a monopoly is that they do not stop competition in the underlying product category (Heinz vs. ketchup remember).


Try starting your own bank or insurance company or medical company and see if you can do it for under 10 million dollars in license and lawyer fees. And probably half of the professions nowadays require for you to get a government license before you are allowed to do it, even for things as ridiculous as landscaping.


Creating websites and services. I have built 100+ websites without having to ask for anyone's permission.


Is it good to have just a little bit of cancer in your body? No. I'm against all cases where force is used against peacefully acting people.


All government regulations are bad, because they are the use of force against peacefully acting people. In a free society, regulations would be replaced with contracts, which you are free to enter into or decline. Of course if you don't take the contract I offer you, you also don't get the product. But no force is used and everything is voluntary.


Do you seriously feel the need to ask this question? Are you not already perfectly aware how I will answer it?


So I guess this is what it really starts to come down to. You believe the group of people calling themselves the government own everything on this planet. I have repeatedly asked you when and how they started to do so. Can you give me an answer?


Seems like you rest your case on  that not happening in the US. You are of course wrong:
"Hundreds if not thousands of homes and businesses a year on average are raided by SWAT teams, houses ripped apart by IRS agents tearing through personal belongings because they may not have paid the boss his cut."
source: 
 &gt;Your admission that rape is no different than a punch in the face
Where did I say that rape is no different? You are twisting my words again. Quote me saying that. I said that there are various degrees of rape and punching in the face.


No, like I said in my earlier response, rape is likely to be worse generally speaking, since it tends to cause longer lasting negative consequences to humans (mental trauma being one of them).


I really don't understand why you keep asking questions that you already know my answer to. No, responding to a property right violation is not the same as raping someone. How is that not obvious to you? Taxing someone and raping someone are also not the same action, but they both have the same exact moral problem behind them: the use of force against peacefully acting people. Making someone pick up their litter does not fit that category, since the act of littering is a violation of property rights.


Seriously man, what's wrong with you? Why on earth would you assume my position to be "no harm done"? I have given nothing but consistent answers, condemning any act of rape every single time. It's like you still just don't get it. Rape is always wrong, every single time. Just like taxation is wrong, every single time. Is there are difference between raping someone and taxing someone and littering? Yes. Are they all wrong? Yes. Could my position on this possibly be any clearer?


Let me prefix this by saying that I'm against the concept of public streets. Everything should be privately owned. But in the current system that we unfortunately have, littering is a violation of public property and can be responded to. Let me point out that it's quite telling how you refer to some property as public while in other places insisting that everything is owned by the government. Why do you separate the two, since according to you there is really no such thing as private property?
@_date: 2016-09-17 13:00:28


You said that including money in the realm of monopolies is only done by people who are "batshit crazy". I asked why that would be the case. You said that it's the case because the Wikipedia article didn't specifically mention money. I pointed out that a definition doesn't have to list all possible articles that fall under it. The Wikipedia article doesn't have to list say rubberbands or spraycans to make it clear that they could be monopolized. You then started talking about monorails, which I still have no idea of how it answers my point. 
So let me ask again, what part exactly in the common definition of monopolies, excludes money from it? If you think money cannot be talked about as a monopoly, then what would you call the difference of having competing money inside a country vs having just a single money inside a country? Do we have to invent a new term to this situation so commonly known as a monopoly? Why?


The minting of Liberty dollars was in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 486:
"Whoever, except as authorized by law, makes or utters or passes, or attempts to utter or pass, any coins of gold or silver or other metal, or alloys of metals, intended for use as current money, whether in the resemblance of coins of the United States or of foreign countries, **or of original design**, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."
I bolded the relevant part, which clearly states that it is against the law to mint coins even if they have an original design.


That's the only rational position you can take, since arguing morals quickly reveals the immorality of your position, or at least the double standard you have when it comes to the use of force. You say morals are subjective and I'm not surprised. It's the moral subjectivists that usually have the hardest time understanding libertarians. The funny thing is that even if you try to convince yourself that there is no subjective morality, I'm pretty sure you would agree with the following statements:
1. Murdering someone who did nothing to you is wrong
2. Rape is wrong
3. Torturing people is wrong
4. Hitting someone for no reason is wrong
5. Slavery is wrong
7. Kidnapping is wrong
8. Robbing random people with a gun is wrong
9. Extorting people with a mafia racket is wrong
10. Punching your wife in the face because the steak was cold is wrong
And so on. Please let me know if there is anything in that list that you disagree with. So even if you try to escape behind your subjective morality, I can still nail you for your inconsistency. All those examples have the same thing in common: the use of force. I'm pretty sure you agree with me on 99% of the cases of using force against peacefully acting people. For some reason you have this one exception when it comes to taxation. My position is the consistent one: the use of force against peacefully acting people is always wrong. Your position seems to be that the use of force against peacefully acting people is always wrong, unless it's called taxation, then it's okay.


Well you can't really stop there now can you? You could just as well say that torturing little babies is no more abhorrent than giving food to a starving child. That's the level of absurdity you end up with if you go down this path.

Of course my policy is to leave everyone alone. The difference between you and me is that I don't want to force you to do anything. You want to force me to do a lot of things. It's the difference between love-making and rape.


I asked for just one. Which you didn't provide.


You yourself wrote that the government is controlled by corporations. I believe that to be a true statement. So ironically, it is you who is siding with the corporations by supporting a big powerful government. Let that sink in for a moment please. You are siding with the oppressors, while I'm fighting them.


I don't want any taxes, just like I don't want any rapes. In both actions you use force to make the other person do something they don't want to do.


I don't want there to be a way to tax the rich just like I don't want there to be a way to rape the beautiful.


I'm fine with anyone working, if that's what they voluntarily want to do. Remember, we never force anyone to do anything. I worked as a child (handing out newspapers) out of my own free will. Were my parents evil for letting me do that? Would my life have been improved if the government would have forcefully stopped me from doing what I wanted to do?


I asked you for just a single example, which you didn't provide.
I also gave you examples of government monopolies. If you hate monopolies so much, why do you support government run monopolies?


Which is exactly why a smaller government will mean that these corporations have less power. How do you not get this?

Oh so the socialist hippies were famous for their understanding of economics? I'll just put that down as one more hilarious statement from you.


Where did I insult you? You yourself admitted that you are a statist. Everything else follows logically from that.


What points? I asked you several times what the difference would be for me to work on code as a freelancer vs. me starting a company to do the same thing. For all the blocks of text you produced, you were completely unable to even remotely attempt an answer to that.


Read the conversation history. It was you who started making points about how great the government is because it stole money from the people and as a result paid individuals to built the early internet. I kept asking you the question about the difference between an individual and an entrepreneur, to which you never answered anything. At one point you gave this weird rant about political corruption, which has zero to do with a voluntary, capitalist, free-market, open source project like bitcoin.


You could have helped me to do so by explaining the difference between working as a freelancer and starting a company, but seems like you are utterly incapable of defending your own thinking and now you need to run for the exit with your pants down.


It's hilarious to read such blanket statements when you carefully avoid pointing out any such fallacies.


Oh yes, just like people enjoyed the fruits of slavery. That made slavery totally fine morally, right? Right?
You never said anything about my rape analogy. We both know why. If rape is wrong, so is financial rape. The common denominator is the use of force against peacefully acting people. Maybe your silence means that you are not really against rape, whether it was sexual or economical in nature.

No, hitting someone in the face is not good. I don't know where you get these ideas from. Hitting someone in the face is only acceptable in self defense. It's never good. But it might be necessary in some situations.


Our? You mean the men who took the land, right? That's certainly not the same group of people as the group living today calling themselves the government. And when the first US government was founded, you can bet they didn't claim ownership over the land. So when and how did these private property rights transfer to the government? 
Why do you think it makes sense to give the ownership of everything on earth to a tiny group of people? And let's not limit it to earth either: if I manage to build a shuttle to Mars one day and inhabit a small area of it, I'm sure even that planet belongs to some government according to you and I should pay taxes if I manage to produce anything while out there? I guess these people own the entire universe in your view? Talking about batshit crazy ideas.




I guess you are not familiar with the concept of self ownership. My body is my property and you can't violate it. If you violate it, you violate my property rights. Batshit crazy.
Now, since you decided to call that "batshit crazy", let's hear your explanation on the principles that make rape wrong. Oh yes, I almost forgot: you have none, for you it's just a "kink" of yours. A willing confession on the limits of your intellectual capabilities, that stop all further inquiry. It's ironic that after admitting such defeat, you call my principled and consistent view on the matter "batshit crazy". Because like it or not, I have shown nothing but consistency in my positions during this debate. Once again, you seem to agree with me that 99% of use force against peacefully acting people is wrong. I extend that to cover all 100% of the cases, including taxation.
Your justifications for taxation and government ownership of the land can be used by any mafia organization exactly the same. That should trouble you just a little bit.
Also, since the government owns everything according to you, you should be totally okay with them raising the tax percent to 99.999% or even a 100%. As the legal owners of the property you are merely renting, they have the legal right to do that after all. So we are nothing but slaves to our government overlords. What an admirable worldview! How is your view any different from supporting slavery? We slaves can never own anything and we need to keep working and working just to pay our overlords "their fair share".

No one can turn bitcoin into anything. Individuals can only write code and hope others will adopt it. That's the beauty of a voluntary system. Core is only successful because people trust them. And you are not successful because no one here trusts you.  


And you don't understand that there is no such thing as corruption in a voluntary system. Corruption is purely a statist problem. When there is a strong state, there is the incentive for corruption. When there is a free market, no corruption is really possible. You can pay whomever you want whatever amount of money you want.


I knew you were a statist. You don't seem to get even the basics of voluntarism. No wonder you are unhappy with bitcoin development. Bitcoin is poison to any statist with half a brain.


Oh you mean the funds they stole from the people actually producing something?


Oh you mean the decaying infrastructure projects that were awarded not based on cost-efficiency but cronyism?


Oh yes, the US government has certainly been keeping the world at peace with your tax money. They certainly haven't been starting more wars than any other country during the last 50 years... Oh wait..
All those things you said could have been said to any slave in the history: "Slave, seems like you are complaining from the warmth of the shelter your master built for you, therefore you should shut up. Slave, you are only alive because the master fed you, you should be thankful". This is the exact same logic you are using.
Again, it boils down to a very simple concept. You condemn rape, without understanding what is wrong about rape. I understand what is wrong in rape and extend the same principle also to economics. Consistency, you know.

Give me an example of a single contradiction. I have been very consistent. The initiation of force is wrong. You will not catch me slipping from that principle even once during this entire debate. You on the other hand said it yourself: your views are irrational kinks (your exact words). I agree.


You keep making these strawmen and applaud yourself for attacking them. I have repeated my analogy again and again. You have not attacked or refuted it at any point: what makes the act of having sex with someone rape, is the use of unwanted force. Taxation is also the use of unwanted force. It's that simple. The common denominator is the use of unwanted force. You can't deny it. You can't refute it. And it kills you.


See now here you seem to think that calling an argument "silly" is some kind of refutation of the argument. Which part of my argument do you disagree with exactly? Do we humans have self-ownership? Do we own our bodies? You would have to deny that principle, wouldn't you. Then again, you have no real reason to call rape wrong. By your own words, your view in the matter stems from "historical baggage" and an "irrational kink". Don't you think it's even a little bit embarrassing to call my reasoning silly, when all you bring to the table is irrationalism by your own admission?


Yet, during this conversation, it was you who had to admit to holding irrational beliefs. I have not had to back of an inch out of any statements I have made. If I had to do so, just show me where. You will not.
You ignored the ultimate conclusions to your reasoning from my earlier post:
Your justifications for taxation and government ownership of the land can be used by any mafia organization exactly the same. That should trouble you just a little bit.
Also, since the government owns everything according to you, you should be totally okay with them raising the tax percent to 99.999% or even a 100%. As the legal owners of the property you are merely renting, they have the legal right to do that after all. So we are nothing but slaves to our government overlords. What an admirable worldview! How is your view any different from supporting slavery? We slaves can never own anything and we need to keep working and working just to pay our overlords "their fair share".
If you are consistent in this worldview, you should find nothing problematic in slavery, mafia rule, national socialism or even rape. It's just the strong ruling over the weak after all. I think we have made a lot of progress in this debate.

Was that your entire reply? Man and then you complain about me skipping your questions..


So I have defined it at least three times by now. What part of my definition are you not happy with?


And that's why I was careful to use the phrase "lightly regulated". Not all markets require you to spend millions in lawyer fees and  government licenses before you can start a business in that market.


No, I'm quite happy with comparing forced redistribution of wealth to forced redistribution of sexual access.
I have no problem with someone littering on their private property. Littering on someone else's property without permission is a violation of property rights and can rightfully be addressed by the property owner. Taxation is very different; I'm forced to pay taxes even if I never violate anyone's property rights.


You can't just ignore what I wrote earlier about this. Graig Wright did not "keep escalating". The guns were out anyway. I have never heard a swat team swarm someone's house for littering. But they do it regularly when they suspect tax evasion.
Now I have counted around ten unanswered questions. If you could show me the same amount of courtesy that I showed you, when I carefully answered each one of your questions, and give answers to them. 
Maybe you can start by explaining how my answer to your "punched in the face" question "forced me to face the untenability of my position"?

Absolutely true and it has never been more clear than this week. Just look what mainstream media did with the DNCLeaks exposing massive bribery and corruption inside DNC. That's right, nothing at all.
But while all that is definitely true, most movies and tv-shows at least try to hide their propaganda a little bit better. Mr. Robot will just call capitalists people who pay to kick homeless persons without any shame. It goes to a whole new level.
My favorite question to ask a leftist these days is this: name the single worst thing a corporation has ever done to you in your life. They usually have serious trouble naming anything of any substance. That's of course because all corporations can do to you is offer goods and services. Governments will murder in the blink of an eye. It boggles my mind that murderers and kidnappers should be trusted with power, while corporations offering voluntary services should not be.

See now for this whole lengthy conversation we have been debating whether or not taxation is wrong. And now it turns out that for you there is no such thing as "wrong", there is only the rule of the strong, end of discussion. If you are consistent in this worldview, you should find nothing problematic in slavery, mafia rule, national socialism or even rape. It's just the strong ruling over the weak after all.
Of course you yourself realize how inconsistent you are in following this worldview. That's why you need to refer opposing rape as "historical baggage" and an "irrational kink". Because of your own inconsistency.

I think you might be making a mistake with this part. Just imagine a government buying 100 $ worth of bitcoin, then immediately selling it for 60 $. Sure it would cost them 40 $ to do it, but it might still be the cheapest way to attack bitcoin. Now perform that same trade 1000 x each day for ten years and you will have created a pretty nasty bear market.This attack would cost 14 million $ per year, which is peanuts. But let's hope there would be enough true believers to hold through that.

I don't think that is true. Does the definition specifically exclude money? Where does it say that? Just because something isn't specifically mentioned, doesn't mean it's excluded. It would be a long Wikipedia article if they had to list every single good or service that had monopoly capabilities. 


Again, what makes money so special so that it should get magically left out? To circle back to my Heinz example: I can't print US dollars, just like I can't make Heinz ketchup. But I should be allowed to create "Dareminder notes" just like I should be allowed to create "Dareminder ketchup". If I'm not allowed to do those things, then we have a monopoly situation.

Now you are just arguing semantics, which is why you ignored my rape-analogy that was specifically designed to deal with such semantics.


Yeah, they shoot you in US for littering. Duh.
The offence in this example was assaulting the police officer. Again, I'm sure you remember the Graig Wright case in which a swat team was sent to his home because of suspected tax evasion. He never attacked any police officer. Yet there they were;  men with rifles, ready to shoot. How is that not a gun pointed to your head?

Seems like you added a bunch of stuff to your reply that I didn't notice. I will answer your questions soon.
Edit: Here we go:


What was not concise with the alternative I provided? The only amendments I made to the Wikipedia definition were both very commonly used when addressing monopolies: it's enough that the product is not provided by anyone else inside a country and brands are not monopolies, only underlying product categories can be.


I believe a monopoly is always bad for the consumer, since there is no competition in providing the service. So yes, I do believe monopolies are inherently wrong, while I don't believe they can form in a free market (real monopolies are always enforced by governments).


Okay so your position is that the groups of men who run the governments own every piece of land on earth? Wow, they are like the 0.000001%. And to think that people were upset about one percenters!


Because it's the use of force against peacefully acting people.


 
I don't think I have to; both of those actions are wrong. Why would the degree between them, which can certainly vary depending on the case, be relevant?


Don't twist my words. Forcing someone to have sex with you is rape. And no, you still can't rape someone, even if they have fallen behind in their rent payments.


Let's add that to the sea of absurd positions that you seem to swim in. That and the fact that according to your view on morality, there is no difference between feeding a starving child and torturing a baby. And that the group of people who call themselves "the government" own everything on earth.


Except that he doesn't, because buying them is a completely voluntary action. Again, I'm amazed that I have to explain this to you.


Sure, but that's not rape.


It's not difficult to get across at all, but it requires you to take the position that the group of maybe something like 10 000 people own everything on earth. I'm kind of curious how you arrive at that conclusion.
@_date: 2016-09-15 15:58:42


Bitcoin is what is trying to break the monopoly. That's why it had to be so carefully designed to be anti-fragile. If the government could have shut bitcoin down, they would have done so long ago. Again, just look at what happened to the predecessors of bitcoin. Their creators all went to jail.


Okay so first you wanted to define the word monopoly so that nothing is a monopoly. Now you want to define it so that everything is a monopoly. The corner shop has a monopoly on being the only corner shop in that particular corner. Again, not very useful, and certainly not the how the word monopoly is commonly used.


If you don't put a gun to my head if I don't give you rutabagas or deal with you, then I have no problem.


Because the government wants me to use a currency that they control? But fine, I can drop the tax part, because it's not important for my case. What is important for my case is that the government has a long history of jailing people who have tried to create competitors to the dollar inside the US. It's no different from how they enforce a taxi monopoly in many countries: if you compete with their taxi monopoly by driving your own taxi, you get fined or thrown into jail.

That's not my premise. I'm fine with self defense. My premise is the non-aggression principle, which states that the initiation of force against peacefully acting people is always wrong.


Well let's be accurate here: asking me to do something is absolutely fine. Forcing me to do something is not.


No, there is always a contract involved when you rent something. I'm fine with negative consequences for breach of contract. I didn't sign any contracts with the government though. I just happened to be born here.
My position on the rent matter is as follows:
-I own my house (for you it might be simply a rental relationship with the government, but I still have the right to controlling it and renting it so it doesn't matter)
-If someone rents my house, they enter into a contract with me
-If they don't hold up their end of the contract (paying the rent), I have every right to terminate my end of the contract (letting them live in my house)
The non-aggression principle does allow for me to defend my property. So where is the contradiction?
I'm sure you'll now circle back to your claim that I'm simply renting my land from the small group of people calling themselves the government. Now this is the very core issue to our disagreement and probably the one we should really focus on. I agree with you, that if I'm basically a slave for the group of people calling themselves the government, and I can never really own anything, then sure, they can do with me and my property what ever they want. They can tax me 70%, 90%, 100% with the might makes right principle that you believe in. It's just that I happen to disagree with slavery, and I disagree with the claim that the whole universe is owned by a few humans calling themselves the government. I believe in the principles of natural law, where you actually have to inhabit or otherwise put to use the land you claim ownership over. You can't just make a blanket claim over the entire earth. Use it or lose it. Where is the contradiction in my thinking?


 
Correct. Raping someone violates their self-ownership, the right to own and control their own bodies. Raping someone is also never an act of self defense, so you don't even have that leg to stand on.


Incorrect. You don't have the right to violate the property of others (the owner of the porno). If you violate the property rights of others, they have the right to stop you from doing that, using the least amount of force necessary. I don't see any contradiction.
Again, to put it in a very simple argument (I'm hoping you'll address this with formal logic):
1. Raping someone is the initiation of force against peacefully acting people, therefore it's wrong.
2. Defending your property against theft, is not the initiation of force against peacefully acting people, therefore it's not wrong.
Can you point out a contradiction in those two statements?


Slander becomes the tool of the loser.


I disagree. The parents do not own their children. They are responsible of taking care of their children, just like I'm responsible of taking care of you if I keep you in my basement. If I would keep you in my basement, without feeding you, I would be a murderer. The same applies to children, who are essentially unable to care for themselves. The parents have obligations towards their children, but not ownership over them.


So what you are doing is essentially paying to one mafia organization (the government) in order to not have to pay to another mafia organization (the mafia). What's the difference between the two? As long as you keep paying, they are happy with you and treat you nicely. As soon as you stop paying, they will make your life miserable. What's the difference really?


How exactly do you vote them out of office when they control the candidates you can choose from?


So commit suicide in other words?


Do we really have to assume that? Do you really think Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump represent what the people wanted?


Not true, just look at slavery. They can feed us with some cheap nutrients to keep us alive for decades. This claim is thus demonstrably false.


That's all we are according to the logical conclusion of your worldview. It doesn't matter to you that the basic declaration of human rights includes the right to own property. For you there is no such thing as human rights, only might makes right. Am I wrong?
You didn't really address the main issue, which is that since your philosophy boils down to the law of the jungle, you should have nothing against slavery, mafia organizations, national socialism or rape. You already admit this is the case with rape, by saying that your dislike of it is an irrational kink. Is your dislike of slavery and mafia organizations also simply the result of irrationality as well? I don't think you can take the position that there would be something wrong with slavery, since it's just another representation of might makes right. I can easily take the stand against slavery though, since it violates the non-aggression principle. Since in practice I'm sure you and me both dislike slavery, it seems like once again my world view and basic premises produce results that are in harmony with my actual outlook on the world, while yours will produce another contradiction (you dislike slavery, but can't really show any reason why it would be wrong). If you disagree, please explain to me why slavery would be wrong in your world view?

If it helps your case, I'm willing to grant a monopoly to a supplier that has more than a 90% market share of a particular market inside a particular country, for a prolonged time (say 10+ years). One thing that clearly falls under this definition is of course money. One thing that I bet you can't find any examples of, is a private company operating in a lightly regulated market.


But I did answer the question, by saying that it depends on the case. If you punch someone in the face hard enough to cause lifelong damage and pain, it's probably worse than if you have sex with your sleeping girlfriend. I just don't understand why it matters, when they are still both wrong. 


How is that? Like I said, I think I already answered the question by saying it depends on the case. If you want me to broadly generalize, I'm fine with that too: in general, I assume rape is the worse of those two actions, since it lasts longer and tends to cause more permanent damage to a human being. So tell me, how exactly did this answer make me "face the untenability of my position"?


Yes, obviously so. So what?


Yeah, I did answer it though. I just said the answer doesn't really matter. I don't see why it's significant in any way. It's like asking which one is worse -stabbing someone in the belly or stabbing them in the neck. I don't care, stabbing is wrong.


And that justifies rape then according to you?


I haven't made any contracts with "the government". I also don't agree that this small group of people and the corporations that control them, own every piece of land in my country.


Yes, you seemed to think that I would call asking someone to pay rent "rape". I would never say such a thing. And you know it very well. We both know that I'm comparing the underlying principle in rape and taxation, not equating the acts themselves. The underlying principle, the thing that makes both rape and taxation wrong, is the use of force against peacefully acting people. I'm sure you understand arguing from principles, so don't try use hyperbole as if you didn't.


Comparing the principle of what makes rape wrong to the principle that makes taxation wrong, is a perfectly valid comparison.


I have ever heard anyone make such a claim. Natural law, which granted people the right to own the land that they inhabited, existed long before the US government. I'm not sure at what point the ownership of everything would have suddenly been transferred to the group calling themselves the government, but I'm sure you will explain that to me soon.


Yes, I understand how property rights work. If the house is 100% my property after the divorce, and she refuses to leave, she is violating my property and I have the right to remove her using the least amount of force necessary.

So what? How does that in any way support your assertion that money should be excluded from the category of possible monopolies?


So your position is that anyone can create a competitor to the US dollar inside the US? Are you serious? Why did the creator of Liberty dollar go to jail?


You are saying that I should only take what you say as fact if I'm batshit crazy? Well I'm glad you recognize that yourself. A pretty weird position to take though.


No, I mean exactly what I said. The forceful redistribution of wealth. I can live on my own piece of land and never bother anyone for anything, yet you support the act of forcing me to give a part of my wealth to a government. Just admit it.


Like I predicted, you have to evade giving a meaningful answer to this the best you can. Are you really saying that the moral significance of rape has to do with "sticking a sharpie up there"? Well what if someone wants "a sharpie up there"? Clearly it's not rape then. So in other words, you didn't answer the question. And you can't, since you know that the only thing that makes a sexual act rape is the unwanted use of force. Which is exactly what taxation is too.


Explain why you consider rape immoral. Saying "it's a kink" explains nothing. I'm sure you wouldn't take it as an answer from me to any questions you ask. It's basically like surrendering your intelligence and saying that you don't know why rape is immoral. Do we really need to sink to that level?


Are you seriously saying that you are justified in forcefully having sex with someone who "Insists on living at your house, refusing to pay rent, snarfing down all the food in your fridge &amp; leaving her pubes in your razor"?
I have news for you; it's still rape. You can throw a squatter out of your property and refuse to give them resources. But you can't forcefully have sex with them. I can't believe I need to explain such a thing to you. You are slowly bankrupting yourself intellectually in this conversation, which is actually quite understandable, since I have predicted all along that your views will not hold water when inspected carefully.


Again, I can't believe I actually need to explain this. The difference between perverts, whores and rapists is the act of forcing someone to do something they really really don't want. The use of force. So why are you against rape but for taxation? Both are the use of force against peacefully acting people.


Do you admit that men with guns drawn out entered his house even though he had never threatened them with violence? The only reason they entered his house pointing guns was his alleged tax evasion. So maybe we can stop nitpicking about me saying not paying your taxes will result in guns getting pointed at your head, when there is such clear demonstrations of exactly that happening.

And your comparison is faulty; making you pick up your litter is the enforcement of property rights.  Rape is the violation of property rights.  They are opposites.


Like I said, enforcing property rights (making you pick up litter) and violating property rights (rape) are at the very opposite ends of the spectrum. Don't know how much simpler I can make this.

Really? So Walmart and Disneyland are governments then?
I don't think you have nailed the true meaning of government if also other organizations fit the description. No, the fact that truly separates governments from the rest is that they reserve a right to perform acts that are illegal for everyone else; for example murder, kidnapping and money printing.


A society where no special groups of people have the right to initiate force against others.


Oh please, I'm so tired of correcting misconceptions about Somalia. Somalia is a failed socialist state. It is the result of socialism, which of course is a system where government has almost unlimited powers. Every single socialist state has become a really bad place to live in.
If government control is better than freedom, then why do these socialist states fail every single time? Why is South Korea doing better than North Korea? Why did West Germany prosper while East Germany became a horrible place to live in? If limited government is so bad, then why is Switzerland doing so well?

I think you are confused about what the term "anarchism" means. It means without rulers, not without rules.
You seem to be saying that there must always be some overlords, that have special rights to use violence against everyone else, in order for a society work. I wonder where you get that idea from.
You say that "given complete anarchy, some people will act violently and anti-socially to the detriment of the majority". Are some people not doing that right now, even without anarchy? What if these bad people are exactly the ones who are the most capable of lying themselves into holding great political power? What then?

@_date: 2015-04-04 13:44:39
Okay you accuse me of backpedaling so let me answer that first: it's quite obvious that there has never been a truly libertarian society yet. The closest we have come was probably in the early days of US. But just because something hasn't been done yet, doesn't mean it's impossible to do in the future. It was once a similarly "utopian" idea that slavery could be abolished. My point is this: I'm showing you examples in which the more you give freedom to people, the more they prosper. Then I'm taking that to it's logical conclusion and not drawing any arbitrary limits, like for example saying that stealing 45% of someones income is good but stealing 50% of someones income is bad. I'm saying that all forceful activity against peacefully acting humans is bad.
You keep saying how you fear that "strong people with guns become the special group of people who have the "right" (meaning: ability) to initiate force against others". But that's what you already have at the moment. That's government. And yes, having less of a bad thing gives your society an advantage. So when Switzerland has less government force ruining their lives, then they will do better than their neighbors.
The problem with your position is the slippery slope. You need to draw arbitrary lines of how much violent coercion towards peaceful people is a good thing. It's like saying that while cancer in general is bad, a tiny amount of cancer is good and beneficial.

I know I'm preaching to the choir but I'm so tired of people still rooting for socialism. It has failed miserably everywhere were it has been tried. How much more evidence do these people need? Socialism doesn't solve poverty, but actually creates more of it, because it subsidizes being unproductive. When people stop producing and live on welfare, the amount of goods and services available for members of society decreases, resulting in increased poverty. Real wealth is not money after all, but access to goods and services. Just ask any Zimbabwean about that.

It doesn't matter. We have established that there is such a thing as universal ethics. That's a good starting point for further discovery of ethics, just like the scientific method is a good starting point for discovery of the laws of physics.
The fact that ethics can be universalized doesn't mean that the average human being has fully discovered all the laws. But we evolve. We had slavery not too long ago. Then we discovered that slavery is unethical. 
I'm sure you would agree that 100% taxation would be slavery. With 50% taxation we might only be slaves to our overlords for six months each year. I'm hoping that one day humans will see that being forced to work even for just one day for someone else is ethically wrong.

I agree with you about the US interventions. I'm strongly against the interventionist policy. So is Trump by the way. Hillary is a hard core interventionist. Expect more wars and more intervention.


You don't need to. It's okay to judge entire groups and seek common behavioral patterns. We humans evolved to do it. Our lives often depend on it. See that drunk looking guy yelling at the street? He might beat you up only 1/10 times, but I will quickly change side. It's okay to recognize that loud drunk people are more likely to beat you up. It's also okay to recognize that a 80 year old japanese grandma will likely not. If I see 10 black people shouting black lives matter slogans, am I racist if I try to avoid them as a white person, after all the violence these protesters have incited?


I will group you with western values, which include the right to free speech, separation of religion and state, where women are equal and where non-believers are not stoned to death. 
Since you believe in abortion and gay marriage, muslims should be the last people on earth you want to import. They kill people because of abortion and they especially kill gay people. Try asking a muslim to bake a cake for your gay wedding and report back how that went. Do you think we have a rape culture? Go talk to muslims, which require four adult men to be witnesses in a rape case. Quess how often rape situations involve four men friendly towards the victim as witnesses.

So you are the one calling me names but I'm the one with "highschoolish arguments"? Got it.
The fact is, that I won the actual argument: I demonstrated how it's morally fine to discriminate against religions that are fundamentally against what you believe to be good in this world. Religions that mutilate little girls, treat women as property, kill people with opposite views and so on. Your response was to deflect: by saying how no such religion could exist because it would be illegal and how Mohammed was a fictional character and so on and so on.
But the point I made was not challenged at all: it's perfectly fine to discriminate against groups of people based on their group behavior. In fact, that is exactly what you are doing with Trump supporters yourself.

And I'm saying that after you import enough muslims, they will redefine what is criminal and what is not. Most muslims support sharia law.

Let me repeat my question since you ignored it:
What exactly you want to have happen? Should the core developers use their precious time to do what they think is lethal for bitcoin because a minority of users demand it on Reddit?

In a free market you get wealthy by serving everyone else's needs. And not spending you wealth frees the resources of the economy to serve others. There is nothing wrong with those things.


You are only paying more for them because of money printing. Capitalism itself is definitely deflationary. Let's hope new technologies like bitcoin bring a stop to endless inflation. It is certainly capable of that.

I'm glad you said that, since in that case it makes it no different from me and my wife deciding together who we will welcome into our house.
That's the whole point: the people in the US have every right to come together and decide democratically if there is a group of people they do not feel is in the best interests of the country to let in. And it makes sense not to let in military aged men from the countries/cultures you are in war with. Do you think the Russians let many military aged German men voluntarily in to the country during WW2? Of course not, that would have been completely crazy.


On the contrary, I have experienced it first hand. They built an immigration center right next to my children's daycare. Young men were hanging out there all day, giving long stares at the mothers bringing in their kids, often fighting and even stabbing people. The local shop was pillaged by swaths of these people, and the cashier girl couldn't do anything but to start crying. A few days ago an immigrant stopped me on the street with a map. He needed to find a lawyer. I did the best I could to help him and found the right building. I was super friendly to him. Yesterday the newspapers reported of immigrants stealing phones and wallets by asking directions in this very city. Thank god he didn't get my phone because I held it in my hand. I have a lot of first hand experience with these people. Do you?


What a surprise.

It is relevant and here's why: I thought we are debating about the morality of the state, but earlier you detached from any moral judgments against the initiation of force against peacefully acting people. So here's the thing: if your point is simply that the stronger is capable of exploiting the weak, then we already agree and no debate is necessary. That's why I'm only interested in debating the morality of the issues at hand and that is not very enjoyable with someone who is a moral relativist. Earlier you wrote "because of our context I do think the State is correct while slavery is wrong" but you can say that about anything. I could go on and rob people on the street and justify it by saying it's morally right in "my context". So we end up in a situation where no moral condemnation is really possible because of the "context". Then why even talk about morality if there is no truth to be discovered, only subjective context? Why waste the time and energy?


That's enough agreement for me, because now I can ask you if there has ever been an observation made about societies in which sentient beings are tortured purely for personal fun and that it is considered morally good? You say that there is "plenty of evidence throughout human history that human beings are capable of this behavior, and capable of justifying this behavior" but I'm going to need some examples because usually the most brutal acts have been justified as necessary mechanisms for avoiding some greater evil, but I have never heard of a society in which it was moral to torture people purely for your own pleasure. Now if no one has ever observed such a phenomenon, why could we not hold it as a fact similar to gravity and other constants present in our reality?


I'm an agnostic and I don't believe we need to derive natural rights from a god anymore than we need to derive the laws of physics from a god. Why do you think we would need a god for either one of those laws?


I believe the humanity is in the process of discovering the most valid moral laws just like we are in the process of discovering other laws of nature. So just like we have learned a lot about matter and energy, we have learned a lot about morality and ethics. And I think the big trend we have headed towards in the field of morality and ethics is the separation of religion and state, non-violence and voluntarism. Hopefully the next steps are in the separation of money and state, because that is an equally bad combination.
In the end I would like you to make your position in this debate clear, because I have the feeling that it will not be water proof at all. So what is the exact proposition you would like to debate? Can we formulate it as a single sentence? Do you hold any core principles or values that you would like to reveal? I can reveal my core principle: the non-aggression principle (which I'm sure you are familiar with).

I think moral relativism is demonstrably false though. There can be universal ethics, just like there can be universal physics.

So we do have universal ethics.

Let's hope so... On the other hand even the current government seems to have very little concern of how bad it looks in the eyes of the public. They are getting caught left and right breaking laws and even the constitution, and nobody goes to jail. And of course there is the biggest scam of them all, the federal reserve, which is nothing but a bank cartel, in which private bankers collude with each other to control the most important price in the entire economy, the price of money. The ones in control of that must be laughing at how they can get away with simultaneously convincing the masses that cartels and monopolies are very bad but the central bank cartel and government monopolies are good. I mean that requires some serious mind bending to hold those two contradictory beliefs.
@_date: 2015-11-14 13:15:24
Ask yourself how any company gains from a cartel.
Let me quote Thomas Jefferson:
"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs. "
Since the Federal Reserve was created, there have been 18 distinct recessions or depressions: 1918, 1920, 1923, 1926, 1929, 1937, 1945, 1949, 1953, 1958, 1960, 1969, 1973, 1980, 1981, 1990, 2001, 2008.

Let me start by saying that I appreciate your way of debating, you seem polite and even willing to grant some points, which is a rare quality in internet debates. That to me is a sign of someone who is genuinely interested in the truth.


While I can see some truth in that argument, here's the other side of the coin:
How is the average joe going to invest anything, when he is already living paycheck to paycheck and the cost of everything keeps going up? Inflation destroys the purchasing power of regular people (the rich can always hedge against it by buying assets like real estate and stocks) and when the middle class has no purchasing power, they also have no chances for investing. If things would be getting cheaper, people would actually have some extra cash in their hands and I'm pretty sure most would spend or invest it. Computers and mobile phones act very deflationary (getting cheaper and better each year) but those are actually bought quite often by the masses. I really don't think most people would hide cash under their mattress, because life is short and people have desires. On the other hand, if someone would be able to deter consumption, kudos to them. There is nothing evil in saving up money. When someone saves up money, he is essentially saying "The economy owes me favors for which this money is proof, but I don't need any favors right now". That actually frees the resources of the economy to serve other people instead of the saver. I don't see how that can be considered a  bad thing.




The only thing that increases real GDP is when investments result in more production. I can sell you hot air for a billion dollars, and that would increase the GDP accordingly, but has the economy actually improved? I would argue (lending the argument from George Gilder) that economic growth is simply learning. The cavemen had all the same resources available than we have (land, oil, minerals, labor etc), but they were not wealthy, because they hadn't learned to utilize them. What separates us from the cavemen is simply learning. Now when you dilute the value of money based on the commands of the few in charge, and you price control the most important price in the economy, the price of money, that's the opposite of learning. It actually destroys information.


It's good that you recognize this. I would argue that the next step is recognizing that there is no good reason to draw any arbitrary limits here. What is it in the nature of the magical 2% inflation target, that makes it optimal for human action? I have never heard a good answer to why 2% is better than 3% or 0%. Or why we recognize that the biggest problem in communism was that price controls destroyed market indicators and lead to inefficient markets and supply side shortages everywhere, but price controls for money are actually somehow good for us, even though they destroy information just the same.


If some business increases their profit margin, others will eat their lunch by selling the same product cheaper.

Yes, I'm going to presume most people here know about basic monetary concepts such as inflation, just like I will presume some other things like the basic capacity to understand language, use a computer and so on. It doesn't have to mean they are just like me, it's probably enough that they are over their toddler years. I'm pretty sure you presume a lot of things about people as well, because having absolutely no presumptions would make every day life rather tricky.

For me the answer is simple, it violates the self-ownership of humans.


Yet you are willing to lock peacefully acting people in jail for injecting a substance into their own bodies (drug use), how is that not a blatant contradiction?


I don't think most people like someone taking their resources based on a threat of violence.


Yet you are happy to divide people into two classes with very different priviledges and rights: the rulers and the ones being ruled.


Now the weakness of your position is really starting to show. There seems to be no evil the state can perform that you would be willing to condemn. I'm sure you are fine with state led genocides as well, I don't see how you could not be.


Don't poison the well. You have not destroyed anything, you have simply stated an absurd position that is impossible to defend (and by which you are clearly not living yourself). You said "your claim of ownership of your body deprives me of natural resources" and seem to think that the whole of humanity somehow collectively owns everything (or nothing) in the universe. Let me ask you this: from where do you derive that principle? Using your own words, does the universe "think" that principle is valid? Taking that position to it's logical conclusion, you shouldn't oppose rape, because the person being raped has no right to "deprive" her/his private parts from anyone else. 
Just to be clear, I don't think the universe "thinks" anything. I'm saying that human beings, just like everything else in existence, have a nature that we can discover. Just like we have discovered 1+1=2, we have discovered a moral principle that says causing unnecessary suffering is bad. It has nothing to do with the universe (or a god) thinking something. It has to do with how things are. Why they are like that is a big mystery for everyone. Just like the ultimate origins of the universe is big mystery for everyone.
Because you are so fond of the state, I would like to hear your definition for it. The only coherent definition I have heard (that doesn't fit any other entities) is that it is a collection of people who claim a monopoly on the use of force against everyone else on a specific geographical area. Do you agree with that definition (if not, please provide a better one)? If you agree with my definition, then could you please explain to me why you consider it good for a small subset of people to have a monopoly on violence? Do you support monopolies in other areas as well?
Also, I'm interested in why you are so silent on the matter of your core principles and values? I have a hunch it is because you know that your support for the state is not logically compatible with them. If you have core principles and values that are truly compatible with the state, then please enlighten me!

I get where you are coming from and I certainly agree that reform is necessary. I think communism vs capitalism was the main difference that really separated Finland and scandinavian countries from the Soviet block and we can still see the effects of communism even today in former Soviet countries. Unfortunately the EU and the US are heading towards all-powerful surveillance states and central planning at the moment. So in a way I'm relieved  that there are counter forces like Russia and China. I also feel like we are pushed by the mainstream media towards a Nato membership, and that is the last thing I want for Finland. I have no trust for the US. They are the ones bombing all the countries these days. Nobel peace prize winner Obama has so far bombed seven different countries. What a great peacemaker. But don't get me wrong, I'm very skeptical of Putin too. I would like to see all positions of power evaporated and decentralized. Because if there is one thing that history has shown us, it's that power corrupts. Putin is a great example of that, but so is Obama.

1) The analogy doesn't actually apply to anything the US has done.
2) If the analogy did apply, its not clear that the behavior would be wrong. 
For me it's enough to focus on point 2) since if you don't oppose slavery, then I don't see any inconsistency in your views. You would be perfectly rational in supporting both slavery and the state. I only have a bone to pick if you would defend one and condemn the other, but that doesn't seem to be the case. You seem to be pretty much a relativist, which I think could be easily cured by reading "The Ethics of Liberty" from Rothbard. It's available for free at the Mises institute website.

Okay so if A pays his debt back in March, then the bank has that dollar. The bank can lend it to B. Now B has the dollar. A still owes the bank a second dollar in interest. Let's say B buys something from A with a dollar. Now A can pay back the interest he owes, but B needs two dollars to pay back his debt and interest and only the bank has any money (1 dollar). What will happen next? How can this loop get closed? Seems to me like the only way B can ever even dream of paying back his debt+interest is if more debt (more dollars) are borrowed into existence -creating a never ending spiral of debt.

True. So what? The exact same argument could be made for the opposite case; raising the blocksize would take bitcoin to a direction many of us didn't subscribe to.


Again, I can make the exact same argument.


True, but you are again comparing a system that is based on the use of force to a voluntary system. That's why I used the marriage analogy: since you are not forced to marry anyone, it doesn't really make sense to complain about people you don't want to marry. Just go marry someone else. If it's a forced marriage, then I understand complaining about it.

Certainly, I have no disagreement there. 


I also think this issue would get solved easily if land was privately owned. If someone wants to help immigrants, they are free to do so. I would probably be happy to help some of them if they promised not to act against my core values. But there would not be the awful forced association that the current situation creates, where I have to deal with people that have often opposing values just because someone else wanted to help them. Also, nobody would allow aggressive people on their property for very long, so the immigrants would really have to be on their best behavior and serious crimes would get them kicked out. And if there was zero effort to get employment, I think many land owners would start to pressure their guests regarding that matter.
So I think we are pretty much in full agreement here. The current non-voluntary system combined with open borders and huge economic incentives to migrate create massive problems and cultural clashes. In a voluntary, free-market, private property society country borders could be completely eradicated since each individual would be free to associate with whomever they please.

@_date: 2016-05-10 20:28:04


They should allow markets to determine interest rates, not these private bank cartels (= central banks). The price of money is the most important price in the entire economy and it's completely monopolized and controlled by a small elite.


I strongly recommend reading a book called The Creature of Jekyll Island, which tells you about the origins and purpose of central banks. Central banks have a choke hold on pretty much every government in the world and their plan is to make governments go ever deeper into debt so that that they can enjoy the interests of those debts. Governments have to keep raising taxes just to manage the ever increasing debt. If there are no tax havens, the amount of taxation will creep towards 100%, until we are nothing but slaves to the central banks. Having tax havens means that we slaves have some options available to us, if governments start taxing us too hard. This limits the amount of taxes governments can levy upon us.

Again, if the amounts of bitcoin in the system keep growing, why would they not liquidate big chunks of it right now?
There are only two options:
Either MMM has the coins, or the coins have been paid to the users. You must recognize those are the only two options. If MMM has the coins, they can clearly liquidate a big chunk of them (otherwise the coins wouldn't accumulate). If the users have the coins, they can choose to hold them or liquidate them. If they liquidate, then there should be an even outflow that probably matches the inflow pretty well.
I'm not convinced either that the MMM leaders actually have a good reason to liquidate. If they are running an illegal scheme, then clearly their wealth is best protected in bitcoin. So why exactly would they liquidate?

Of course we are just speculating, but I'm not so sure about that point. Having an increased purchasing power and lower home prices might actually make houses much more affordable for people.

Thanks for a though-out response!
Here's my rebuttal:


-Because I would actually have some money to invest. My day-to-day costs have gone up so much that I have nothing left to invest. Of course this is not the case for the wealthiest people, but I'm in the middle class.
-Because human desires are infinite and I would always be looking for ways to become even wealthier 


That might be true, but then again many more enterprises could deliver such high returns because people would have so much more purchasing power. In other words because people  could afford to buy more goods and services, it would be easier to make a lot of money providing them.


This statement I don't understand. Inflation hurts the poor the most because they have no means of hedging against it. The rich can invest in land and other real assets, which protect them from inflation. The poor have no protections really.


The people who use this mantra don't seem to understand what economic growth really means. I like the way George Gilder puts it: economic growth is simply humans learning new things. Doesn't mean it has to result in greater waste of resources (could lead to the very opposite as well).

Do you think ends justify means then? What about the opportunity costs from not having the free market allocate those resources?


This is exactly what you create: a ruler class that can freely use violence over it's subjects. You have created the ultimate version of the weak and the strong. George W. Bush killed hundreds of thousands of people and committed several war crimes during his presidency. Yet he has perfect immunity. 


Do you? Then how can I solve disputes with my family, friends and coworkers all the time without a need for any central authority? Our dispute solving is entirely based on voluntarism and the fact that if anyone is unhappy, they have the power to leave.

I'm sure you realize that the dollar can be divided into smaller units. It doesn't really matter for my example if we are talking about a dollar or a billion dollars.

That would be like trying to debate physics with someone who doesn't accept the validity of the scientific method or math with someone who doesn't accept that 1+1=2, in other words it would be futile and a waste of time for us both. That's why I feel the need to go back all the way to our very basic principles to see if we can find any furtile ground for having a debate. I do indeed hope that we can find common core principles that we can agree on because I get the sense you might indeed be a worthy opponent.
My biggest problem is probably the relativism that your philophy seems to be rooted on. If you don't mind I would like to poke around that concept before moving further. Why? Because I think moral relativism leads to the conclusion that everything is permitted, especially if you don't get caught, and that any moral condemnations are simply relative meaning there is no real reason to hold the as universally valid. And if something is not universal, it's no longer in the realm of philosophy but rather pure aesthetics. 
So let me probe a little bit to understand your position:
1. Do you believe that the reality we live in has objective rules or principles? For example E=MC2, 1+1=2 or that iron weighs more than helium?
2. Do you believe that torturing innocent, sentient beings purely for personal fun and entertainment is not objectively wrong (but might be considered morally sound behavior in some societies)?

No, I'm examining the principle behind allowing people choose who they associate with while not allowing groups of people to choose who they associate with. 
Am I bigoted if I team up with my wife and decide that we won't allow certain groups of people (say satan worshippers) in our house? Because now we form a group of people. The government is simply a bigger group of people. So why do you give my family (a group of people) the right to choose, but not the country (a group of people) an equal right to choose?
@_date: 2015-10-28 10:12:55


You make two interesting assumptions: 
1. That government regulation tends to produce even playing fields. Let's take a look at the two most regulated industries; banking and medicine. Do you think government regulation has produced even playing fields in those industries?
2. That a democratic vote is a better way of allocating resources than free market capitalism.

@_date: 2015-10-20 11:46:12
Thanks for your answer. Now let's see how it fits our slavery analogy:
What if I as a slave owner, told my slaves they were free to leave my ranch, but that they would be immediately arrested at other ranches? What if I told them that they could avoid being arrested in other ranches, if they took a boat to the sea? Of course I would not provide them with any boats or means of getting a boat. And of course the likelihood of anyone surviving weeks at the sea without resources would be practically zero. If I would make such arrangements as a slave owner, would that make slavery acceptable?
Let's also try a different analogy:
Say your family had lived on a big farm for centuries. I then came to your farm with twenty men and guns and told you that we are the new government. I would allow your 15 member family to vote on some issues, but of course you would be in the minority against the 20 of us. We would then proceed to vote that you have to give us all your land. If you would protest, we would simply point out "the sovereignty of the state"  and how you had signed a social contract with us. I would also tell you that you are free to leave your farm if you don't want to adhere to the social contract. Would that be ok with you? 
@_date: 2015-11-19 13:53:51
My explanation is the use of force.
These people have encountered so much violence and compulsion against them during their lives, and they see so little other options in fighting against evils they have witnessed, that it drives them to extreme actions. When you have nothing to live for, and you have a lot of hate in your heart, things like this happen.

If you repeat a lie often enough...
It should be pretty clear how prices getting lower is great for regular people. Deflation is also the natural condition in free market capitalism, when productivity is improving everywhere year by year. Central bankers need to convince us about the "evils" of deflation in order to keep printing endless amounts of fiat.
There is one situation in which deflation is genuinely bad of course: if you have large amounts of debt. But it's a weird choice to punish savings and favor debt when common sense tells us that savings should be preferred to taking large amounts of credit.

While I get that you are trying to help out bitcoin adoption here, I would still ask you this:
Why are you trying to get this company to accept bitcoin?
Shouldn't you rather want to hold on to your bitcoins and give the companies worthless fiat?
If you want to see bitcoin succeed, simply hold on to it. It will cause it to go up in value. When it goes up in value, it triggers more bubbles which cause adoption cycles.
That entrepreneur should accept bitcoin because he wants to have it. He will want to have it, if you want to keep it. Now you are signalling him the opposite: you want him to have the bitcoin instead of you. Just hold.

If you try to learn to do it yourself, it might take years and your idea might be obsolete/done by then.
I think you have three options:
1. Create a pitch deck and try to get VC funding
2. Present your idea to programmers doing bitcoin projects and if they are interested in your idea make a contract in which they get a percentage of the company
3. Try lighthouse/other crowd sourcing websites
All three options expose your idea to other people, so make sure to grab some domains, make a detailed road map and get ready to move fast. You might have to quit school/work to be fast enough if your idea is truly groundbreaking.

-Violence is acceptable in order to fight capitalists
-All human beings are essentially evil, you just need to dig deep enough
-Men are creeps that harass women
-A muslim woman is part of the "good gang"
-Corporations are full of racists, sexists and fascists people
-Marriage is evil and careless sex is good
-A corporation is to blame for the sickness of the main characters father
-Everyone hates capitalism

Interesting, so in your view a group of violent people can grab  some guns and claim ownership of all the land in an entire continent? Do you feel like this is a good and fair system for distributing land ownership?


There are only two ways of deciding how to use scarce resources. One is based on force and the other is based on voluntary agreements. Can you point the flaw in that statement?


See what you did there? You want to define "slavery in the us" because you know very well, that defining the word "slavery" revolves around the concept of human ownership -a concept that you seem to embrace.


It's quite funny how you had to pick your example from an activity that the government has made illegal. If drug trade was legal, there would be no violence in it. It's only violent because of the government driving it outside any legal frameworks. I'm sure even you notice how you really don't have any good examples of companies using violence against you.


Irrelevant. I can rent a house too.  It doesn't matter. I will go to jail if I don't pay taxes and if I try to defend myself when they drag me to jail against my will, I will face violence. You are fighting really hard to not see the violence in this.
Do you also not see any violence in a mafia guy threatening to take my house forcefully if I don't pay their racket? Is it a non-violent situation if he only tells me about the gun, without actually having to pull the trigger?


 
Yes, I'm a big believer in opportunity costs. Especially in those that are the result of force-based misallocation of resources. You seem to be completely blind to those opportunity costs. If governments wouldn't steal half of our income, we could work 50% less. How is that for opportunity costs?


So are you seriously claiming that QE doesn't inflate the balance sheets of banks? You are the first one I have ever heard claiming this. Can you give me a source? The earlier source you provided supported my view, not yours.


Okay, so now you see the inflation? You just argued against it earlier.

@_date: 2016-07-13 19:51:34
I'm curious how all this works out in your mind: you say you don't have a good or bad, yet you are clearly pushing for very specific things. Why? Why do you want efficiency if there is nothing that is good or nothing that is bad? Why do you want to expose scammers if there is no good nor bad? Earlier you said things like "So we try to have the humility". Is it good to have humility? If not, why do you try to have it?
I think you are just trying to raise a smoke screen to protect the weaknesses in your thinking. It's very clear that you prefer some things over others. You do have a good and a bad.


Okay so now you are saying that central planning fits within what you call markets? Seems like everything is a market to you. Then what meaning is left for that word? Is it also a market situation when a robber puts a gun to your head and steals your wallet? Can we have your definition of a market so that this discussion can be a bit less slippery?
@_date: 2016-07-30 20:14:56

Kudos for answering all my questions!


I agree with this a 100%. But I think we should recognize the true enemy here: using the state to dominate. Capitalism combined with the state can indeed become a very deadly combination, like just about anything else can too when combined with the state. That's because the very essence of the state is to have a special class of people that have the right to steal, assault, kidnap and murder.
The problem is not capitalism at all (which is simply the right to own and trade property, two clearly beneficial things), but statism.


There is a very very important distinction: they don't have the right to initiate force against peacefully acting people.


Absolutely true, and not good. But the answer is to get rid of the state, not the right to own and trade property. Leftists usually (and I'm not putting you into this category) want to give the state more power. The sad irony is that by doing so, they hand out more power to the very same corporations they so despise. By removing government power, you actually remove power from these corporations.


It is disgusting. But the disgusting part here is again the use of force against peaceful people. Take away the government from the equation and these corporations don't have any other power than to offer people goods and services, which the people can freely reject.


I really appreciate you admitting this. It makes you seem like a reasonable person.


Minimum wage is again a government construct and it's deeply immoral and hurts the poorest among us the most. Am I crazy for stating such a controversial thing? Hear me out: If you had to choose whether you hire person A with 5 years of work experience or person B with no work experience and they both cost the same, which one would you hire? Any sane recruiter would hire the experienced skilled worker in that situation right? Minimum wage means that person B has no means of competing against person A. If there was no minimum wage, person B could lower his price to land his first job, learn in the job, get valuable experience and raise his value. But the poor, unskilled, inexperienced person B will never stand a chance, since the government forcefully removes his only means for competition. The experienced and established person A loves it though, since it improves his job security.


I know many people think there is something evil in profit. But profit simply means that you have taken land, labor and resources and produced something more valuable from them. You have managed to raise the amount of value in the world and that's a very positive thing for everyone.


But in order for us to explore space, a massive amount of wealth needs to be first created. We will only do all this cool stuff after all our basic needs have been met. Are you familiar with the Maslow hierarchy of needs?

You say that "100 years isn't a person's financial lifetime" but it doesn't seem to be very far from it either. If you can't formulate a principle, then we are just down to picking arbitrary time frames.

That's a very reasonable scenario. But I have nothing against people voluntarily grouping together for self defense.


You can have a leader that decides, you can vote, whatever way of deciding is fine. Note however that simply voting about something doesn't mean it's a democracy: in a democracy the winners get to rule over the losers and force their will on them. In a voluntary system no one gets to force their will upon anyone


Sure, and I have absolutely nothing against organized group self defense. The problem with democracy is that it goes further than self defense: it allows the winners to initiate force against the losers, even if it's not a self-defense situation. Taxation would be an example of this.

You also need to get permissions from two governments to cross a border.

The obvious difference being the violence. When was the last time a company threatened you with violence?


In the law. It's quite clear on what happens if I don't pay my taxes for example.


But wasn't your position that we shouldn't worry about government debt since it can always be inflated away? I'm sure you recognize that when the debt gets bigger and bigger, also the required amount of inflation grows. Hyperinflation has happened before in many western nations.

Thanks for a thorough response. I feel like this last sentence is the important one though. It seems to me like basically your position is "might makes right". So if there are resources that two people want at the same time, it is moral for the stronger one to take them, even if they were initially in in the possession of the other person? If you believe in the law of the jungle where the strong should dominate the weak, then why exactly are you opposed to slavery which is just an extension of the same principle?
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:26:22


Of course I didn't do such a comparison, and I think you are smart enough to understand that as well. I compared rape to the violation of property rights, which is a very strong comparison, since both actions violate the sovereignty and self-ownership of the individual.
Like I said later, it doesn't even have to be rape. I can use any undesired action in my analogy: trying to prevent property violations by giving some people the right to violate property is like trying to prevent torture by giving some people the right to torture.


Good, because it's certainly not necessary. I'm curious what left-libertarianism means in that case though. Can you elaborate how property rights would function in a left-libertarian society now that you made clear that the government shouldn't be granted the right to violate property?


First of all, do you think governments or government appointed actors are somehow magically "impartial"? Second of all, why couldn't these disputes be solved without giving the "impartial" party a monopoly on violence? Why should anyone be granted a monopoly on violence, if violence is not desirable?


In a free society, everyone would have the exact same rights: the right to own property and the right to not be agressed against. That's it. Rich, poor, doesn't matter. Would the rich have better access to goods and services in the legal sector? Of course. The rich will always have better access to goods and services in any sector and any imaginable society. But like I said, it's in the interest of companies to serve the masses, not the wealthy.
 &gt;No wealthier man should be more allowed to commit crimes than others that have less money, and yet it happens with any judicial system.
It happens in the current system, yes. So you are trying to refute my position with something that doesn't work even with governments in place. But if there was no government, there would be competition. And the masses would vote with their wallets and support companies that ensure equal treatment for the rich and the masses. I'm sure you see how that would be in their interest.


There is also no violations of property rights and the non-aggression principle is respected. What could these companies possible do that would be so harmful?


Where is the evidence for that claim? Again, governments have murdered hundreds of millions. A government is like a psychopathic serial killer, yet you are afraid of merchants?


Indeed. So would you rather have these "bastards" running corporations or governments? Hint: one leads to the death of millions, the other might lead to crappy customer service.
 &gt;Even if you don't like a product or service from a company X, you might be forced to buy it if it's part of your needs of your daily life.
Can you give me a single example of this ever happening in the history of the world? Just one. If you want, I can then give you examples of governments murdering people in return.


I'm sure someone can make a good case for slavery too. It doesn't mean it's a moral thing to have. You are defending the existence of a know mass murdering psychopathic serial killer, with a completely hypothetical fictional scenario that has never ever happened in real life. Don't you think that's just a little bit on the brink of insanity?


Yes, to allow the power hungry to control other people via violence.


I already said it: if you are not free to be unequal, exceptional or otherwise different, you are not free at all. Can you explain how I can be free if I have to be just like everyone else and everything needs to be equal?
 &gt;But what is sick is going back the other extreme and think that free market will be the solution of all of our problems.
Right so there should always be just a little bit of cancer and it's sick to advocate a complete removal of cancer from your body? It's like you're saying that rape is bad, but going to the extreme of removing all rape from the world is just stupid.
The free market is ultimate freedom. You don't seem to be such an avid fan of real freedom, if you are not prepared to allow the free, voluntary, non-violent exchange of ideas, resources and wealth.


That was a disappointing and lame ending to an otherwise decent response.

Look, I have a lot of sympathy for that. But I just think the wrong thing is being blamed here. Think about this scenario for a moment: imagine, if there was so many entrepreneurs out there, that labor would be in high demand. Every entrepreneur out there would try to hire you and they would have to compete with each others. What would that do to your wages? Raise them obviously, right? The solution for better wages should be in making it easier to become an entrepreneur, but minimum wages do the opposite: many business models are out of the question because of minimum wages. So there are less entrepreneurs and less demand for labor. That is so sad.


The change in the 1970's was when Nixon removed the gold standard. This allowed the government to steal your wealth through inflation and that process is still active.


If the minimum wage would have been removed, the US could actually compete with China. There would be so many jobs in the US that no one would have problems rising in their career and negotiating higher wages.


I would fully support such a version of UBI. I am a voluntarist and I have no problem with people doing voluntary things. But I'm afraid that in reality it would get funded with involuntary wealth transfers and that's what I have a problem with.


Because we live in such an universe that requires us to perform work in order to survive. If automation can one day remove that need, wonderful! But we are nowhere near that point.


Of course, in a perfect world. But in reality we need to work in order to eat. The amount of work has become significantly less thanks to capitalism and mass production and the quality of work has become significantly easier compared to the jobs 100 years ago, but there is still that basic need to work in order to eat.


It's unfortunate, but the universe is an uncaring system. If you don't find food, you die. It's nobody's fault really, that's just how it is.

That would depend on the rent wouldn't it? If you want to pay less rent, you can move into a more remote location. You can also have a room mate to share the rent with. Many people are happy to pay $5/hour for any of those activities. $5/hour makes you $800/month. If you have room mates you can easily find accommodation for half of that.
If you are good at your job, I'm sure people will even pay you $10/hour. That would make you a whopping $1600/month. Pretty nice for a 12 year old!

You are changing the goalpost in that case. You were clearly advocating for specific actions both the rich and the pretty should perform in order to avoid violence.


How about funding mass surveillance and the "war" on drugs? You must love funding those things too. And isn't it funny how the US meddling in foreign affairs actually gave rise to the jihadists. There were not many of those in Iraq during Hussein for example.


So because you like being raped, it's moral to rape everyone else too?

Is there something wrong with inheriting wealth or other assets? As a father, I work hard to make life easier for my children. I hope they will inherit a better economical situation from me than what I inherited from my parents. I have a hard time seeing why that would be bad. It's not like the assets they will inherit have not been fairly paid for. I have worked hard to obtain them. I would argue that heritages are a moral good, since they increase the quality of life of future generations. Some people inherit genes that make them beautiful. Others inherit wealth. In both cases we should equally celebrate the inheritance. Or do you think we should try to make those who inherited beauty more ugly in the name of equality?

I don't believe letting the market work it's course is a very unrealistic solution. I also believe market based economies have been wildly successful in the past. Central planning and socialism seems to have a much higher rate of failure. Just look at the list of former and current socialist states.
The Greeks don't have to vote for this to happen. They will eventually default and when they don't get any more credit, the only option left on the table is austerity, like it or not.
Your solution of inflation gives banks even more super powers than they have now. I'm sure you are aware that the banks get to multiply the amount of money created by the central bank and proceed to charge interest for the money they create out of thin air?

What do you mean? Taxation does indeed fund violence against the innocent. That's one more reason why it's so immoral. Taxation funds tons of initiation of force against peacefully acting people.


You don't seem to understand that my transaction with the salesman is entirely voluntary. We both want to perform it. There is nothing immoral in voluntary actions. The only involuntary action is when the government comes and collects their taxes from the salesman. It is not rape if it's voluntary on both sides (me buying from the salesman). It becomes rape when it's not voluntary on both sides (the government taking taxes from the salesman).
It's just like when a mafia organisation collects a collection racket from a restaurant owner. It's not wrong from me to eat in his restaurant. He wants me to eat there. What is wrong is what the mafia does. And I have nothing to do with the mafia and I oppose the mafia.

I would certainly prefer banks to undergo proper bankruptcy proceedings like you described.

No matter how advanced robots we get, there will always be jobs for humans. Why? Because there simply won't be enough robots to fulfill every single human need and desire. Time and resources are limited in the universe. There is no way of building enough robots to serve everyone. And don't take me wrong, I'm sure there will be a lot of robots, and they will greatly increase the life quality and purchasing power of humans. We might only need to work a couple of hours per week. But there will never be enough robots to completely remove the demand for human labor.

Oh I'm very happy to talk about monopolies. I agree that monopolies are terrible for the consumer, yet you support the government, which is the number one creator of monopolies. I have actually never witnessed a non-government monopoly anywhere. Can you show me one? And by monopoly I mean of course a company that has acquired and held 90-100% of market share for a substantial amount of time (let's say 20 years).
Government has at least the following monopolies:
-Monopoly on law
-Monopoly on governance
-Monopoly on prisons
-Monopoly on taxation
-Monopoly on police force
-Monopoly on army
-Monopoly on land titles
Many governments also have taxi, healthcare, education and postal service monopolies to name a few.

If you support taxation, then you support the initiation of force against peacefully acting people. Taxation is not self defense. Taxation is a violation of property rights and self ownership, just like rape is. See, I'm sure you and me both oppose rape. The difference seems to be that I also oppose financial rape.


Here Biff is violating your property rights and you have the right to self defense. You can also hire someone else to defend your property. You cannot hire someone to tax Biff.

This is why I asked you to define the word "use". If I own a factory that makes drills, am I using that factory? If I sell the drills that I'm very good at making for something that I'm very bad at making, is there something evil in that? It seems like such a trade would help both parties: I don't need all those drills, but I'm very good at making them, while the other party needs a drill but is very bad at making them.


How is it exploitation if it's voluntary? These workers choose to work for me because I give them the best deal they can get. If they get a better deal someplace else, they go there. Do you think these workers would be better off without me and my factory? If you say yes, then you are literally saying that the workers would be better of without the best deal they can get, which I'm sure you realize sounds a bit absurd.


I really need you to define the words "use" and "exploitation". If I offer you, u/Chickenfrend a job right now in my company, am I somehow exploiting you? Am I making your life worse by offering a completely voluntary extra option to you which you are free to dismiss and ignore?

In other words, every investment has an element of speculation. I'm not sure why you want to single out bitcoin.

So you seem to recognize that it's morally wrong to pay your taxes. But you still advocate for doing it. I will give my wallet when someone puts a gun to my head because I don't want to die. But unlike you, I will speak against robbery. That's the difference between us it seems. 


Dear god, do you really require this level of explaining basic concepts? A voluntary transaction means that both parties want the transaction to take place. Rape and murder don't fit in that category (I can't believe I need to even say this).


When someone puts a gun to my head and steals $10 from me and then buys bullets with that money and shoots someone, am I morally responsible? According to you, the answer must be "yes". How ridiculous.


Yes, there is nothing wrong with buying a watch. What was wrong was the theft part (again, I can't believe I need to explain this). You buy things everyday. How do you make sure they are not stolen goods? That's right, you don't.

Can you break down the numbers why someone couldn't live in a remote area with $1600/month?
Let's see: 
Small apartment with two roommates in a remote area: $200/month 
Onions, potatoes and canned food $3/day = $90/month
Public transportation = $50/month
Utilities (phone, internet, electricity, water) = $200/month 
We have now $540/month. That leaves you with a whopping $1060 extra for each month. 
I know it doesn't matter what I say, since you want others to pay for your existence no matter what. You don't have a moral problem with forcing others to pay for your living, so it's very hard to convince about it being not only morally wrong, but also counter productive.

I would argue that in that process, wealth gets destroyed and everyone is worse off. Wealth works best in the hands of those who can multiply it. When you take it away from the wealth creators and give it to those who don't make it grow and multiply, but only consume it, the net amount of wealth in the world is lowered.
Of course there is very little evidence also that this massive wealth distribution is actually going to those whose ancestors property was violated in the past. It seems like this wealth gets in reality channeled to the very wealthiest people in the world, giving rise to the 1% and crushing the middle class.

How can there be a free market if the ownership of something critically important like production is restricted (and is thus not free)?
How is it not wealth distribution if wealth in the form of production equipment is transferred from the current owners to new owners?
Also, what is stopping these new owners from buying and owning production equipment currently? The lack of wealth (which you want then redistributed)?


I'm not a huge fan of that either. I guess one could argue that corporations allow massive higher risk projects that no single individual would want to risk since they might lose everything. It's good that humans are not too risk-averse since it leads to new innovations.

Yes, taxes fund wars, if that's what you are asking.


I don't understand this question. What middleman? Without taxation, there certainly would be less wars. How many rednecks do you think would have still have wanted to attack Iraq, if it meant they had to immediately pay say $40 000 out of their own pocket to fund it?

You did nothing to refute my statement. Of course there is a difference in degree. But it's still wrong. Just like there is a difference in degree with some college kid having sex with their drunk passed out girlfriend and a violent gang rape on the other side. It's still rape though and it's still wrong.

FIrst of all, why do you want to discuss bizarre events that have never happened and likely never will happen?


In the real world the massive sell off would happen because a competitor crushed Apple or something else that would cause them to lose a big part of their market share. These things happen all the time, just look at Nokia now.


Well just look at the US stock market. It's megalomaniac rise is not reflecting any increased profitability levels for the companies. Seems like real world stock market data disproves your theory of only bitcoin behaving this way.


All prices are speculative. Future can hold anything. If there is another world war for example, all the stock markets will crash to nothing. 
But bitcoin has fundamentally valuable qualities: it is the best source for truth humanity has ever had. It has also been the worlds best performing currency for many many years. It is money that can't be inflated or confiscated. It can't be censored by governments. Some of the smartest coders on earth are working on it feverishly. Every financial institution in the world is talking about it. The fundamentals are extremely strong.


Again, there is no plausible scenario in which this would happen.

I don't pretend to know every single reason for bitcoin price movements. What we do know from economics is that a shrinking supply tends to give upwards pressure to the price of the good and this seemed to be validated for bitcoin during the first halving.
As for the bear market in 2012, it was a likely event because of the major crash in November 2011. Bear markets are natural after big price drops.

Supply and demand. The demand is growing and the supply is shrinking. Of course I don't know the future. But I'd rather bet on bitcoin than the US stock market, which is far above the levels of the previous bubble burst, while the fundamentals are worse in almost every case.

So all land in the US belongs to a group of individuals calling themselves the government? When did that become the case?


Two things can happen: violence or voluntary trade. You seem to prefer the former.


Why don't you explain the difference to me instead? Can you? You said I belong to the group of individuals calling themselves the government. Also slavery was about a group of people owning other people. Not all slaves were treated badly. But they were not free, because they were owned by someone. Seems like you are advocating a rather similar system of ownership over humans.


You didn't answer my question. When was the last time a company used threats of violence or actual violence against you?


And if I don't let them do that (my wages could be in bitcoin for example), what happens then? They will come to my house, and if I  don't comply, I will face violence. Prisons are full of people who didn't pay their protection racket in full (taxes).


Rampant monetary inflation is occurring. Price inflation will follow later, when the money starts actually moving into the economy. Currently it's still sitting in the balance sheets of banks, waiting for the next crash when it will buy them half the world. I'm sure you are aware that the dollar has already lost 99% of it's purchasing power, and that was before all the QE.


That's not true at all. The libertarian platform is based on the idea that using aggression against peacefully acting people is morally wrong. You  probably believe that rape is wrong. We libertarians simply take that further and believe that economical rape is wrong as well.


Why would I do that?


I see improvements too. And these improvements will allow governments to keep enslaving us a few more decades until the system has finally reached a point of collapse. Without all the amazing advances in technology, the economy would have collapsed a long time ago.

So what? It just means we need to protect people from getting mugged. I don't care if the mugger is rich or poor, mugging is still equally wrong.


That wasn't the question. You seemed to advocate for pushing pretty people to have sex with unattractive people, so that they won't get raped by them. Logically you do need to take that position (as you did) since this is the exact equivalent of pushing rich people to give money to poor people in order to not get mugged by them. Both actions force a person to do something they don't want to to do, in order to prevent violent force from being applied towards them. It's basically nothing more than a threat of violence. 


Could it be possible, that this doesn't actually work? The government has been doing that in the western world for decades now. Poor people are still not doing great. Is there just even the tiniest possibility that handing poor people unconditional money doesn't actually work very well?

Just take a look at the size of government during different decades. It has become massive in most countries in the world.

No. You can't give anyone the right to initiate force. If you pay someone to protect your property, they can only act in self defense against an aggressor. That makes it very different from rape.
Let me repeat my argument in a different form:
Wanting to prevent violence by creating a special group with the right to use violence (the government) is like wanting to prevent rape by creating a special group with the right to rape. In both examples you are initiating force and claiming it's necessary to prevent the initiation of force. Which is of course absurd.

Not positive things for me maybe, since I am one of those experienced workers. But yes, positive things for the poor, unskilled workers.


Yes. My lowest hourly salary was around $2 when I was handing out newspapers as a 12 year old. When I was older, I worked at McDonalds for around $7-8. It was great, I learned a lot and got valuable work experience, which helped me to next land a job paying $12/hour.


So what? Not all jobs are meant for buying cars and houses. It doesn't mean those jobs aren't useful. Nobody forces you to not improve your skills in order to land a higher paying job someday. My whole point is that you will have a really tough time finding a job that pays enough to buy a house and a car, if you never get hired in the first place because you have no means for competing with more experienced workers. Do you not see this logic?


Of course this would also be a race to the bottom for all other prices in the economy: if you can get labor cheaper than before, and your competitors can also, then you will need to lower your prices. The opposite is also true: when you jack up the price of labor, you will also jack up all other prices in the economy. Not only will the poorest not get any jobs because they can't compete, they will also have to pay more for everything. Can't you see how badly you hurt the weakest here?


I understand why that sounds tempting, but hear me out: by taxing the productive and subsidizing the unproductive, you will end up with lower amounts of production (what you tax you decrease and what you subsidize you increase). Lower amounts of production means less goods and services. Access to goods and services is what wealth is. You will make the whole country less wealthy. That can't be good.
To be frank, the biggest problem with UBI is not pragmatic though but moral: it is the initiation of force against peacefully acting people. You will forcefully take property from some in order to distribute it to others. I'm sure you are against rape. I'm also against economic rape.

And they fail in this miserably. 2nd gen businesses have a failure rate of 60%, 3rd gen have a failure rate of 90%.

While that is a noble cause, what if it works in the opposite direction? Minimum wages for example punish the weak and favor the experienced, since they remove the option to compete against more experienced workers by offering a more attractive price.

Where did Satoshi ever state this?

Wake me up when it's less than 50%. 80% is still close to monopoly territory. Hashrate is up like crazy and the price has tripled. It doesn't really support your narrative of a sinking ship.

That's true with most investments like government bonds, stocks, and currencies. It's not specific to bitcoin. Also, hoarding is the opposite of dumping on the market. Aren't you trying to have your cake and eat it too? If someone dumps their bitcoins, then they are no longer hoarding. If someone is hoarding, they are not dumping. I have difficulty seeing the issue here.


Absolutely true, we cannot know the demand side for sure. So far it has been growing every year. We do know the supply side almost perfectly though, and that makes bitcoin a very unique currency.


I agree. But I also believe that incentives matter a great deal to humans. And bitcoin has many attractive qualities built into it. Many people have good incentives to use bitcoin.


If you look at the chart, can you tell me what happened a few months after the first halving? I can save you the trouble: the price of bitcoin exploded.


Because every bubble phase leads to a bear market phase. But bitcoin seems to always end up higher than before. Did you know that bitcoin has been the worlds best performing currency in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016? I'm sure even a skeptic like you would have to admit that that's pretty impressive.

I've come to expect higher quality input from you Erik! Usually your posts are well reasoned and I enjoy reading them. I too would ask for you to elaborate. The recent Ethereum bailout does indeed appear to be bowing towards the principles of socialism where core principles can be compromised if it seems to help the masses and legal property of others can be violated if it's a "too big to fail" event.

I agree, however this will happen anyway due to automation and robots. I think deflation will be a better companion to that than inflation.

You talk about things like stopping monopolies, price fixing and irresponsible behavior. Notice how none of those things are related to governments manipulating interest rates or the valuation of money. Governments helping citizens to enforce legal contracts is a very different thing from them performing market manipulation.
So even if some might agree that governments should stop "monopolies" (I don't), that still doesn't show why messing up money related free market mechanisms would ever do any good. It will simply send the markets false signals, and false information is a bad thing for making sound business decisions. 
Also, the only real monopolies are those enforced by governments. In truly free markets, no such things as monopolies really exist. If by monopoly you simply mean that one company is the only one selling a specific product, then every writer or movie maker has a "monopoly" on the IP rights of their products.
The paper notes will probably work similarly like they did when the dollar was gold backed. Could be that time-delays are introduced like addict4bitcoin suggested.

Yes, the obvious reason being that I'm not an expert on cryptography or network infrastructure. Maybe you are familiar with the Dunning–Kruger effect?
Answer this: how do you know that increasing the block size won't cause problems for the network? Have you made measurements and data analysis yourself? Please point me to your research! Have you debunked all the reasons Core laid out why caution is needed, just by yourself, without obviously being an expert in the subject? A remarkable achievement or the Dunning–Kruger effect in action? I let others decide that one :)
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:07:04
Then you won't have the benefits of having a better store of value in bitcoin. Essentially this system would be exactly like a gold backed currency and that makes it much stronger the current fiat currencies we have.

Where did I say such a thing? I'm simply saying that a large part of the world is rather primitive and we need to understand that. Is it fair to accuse a man living in say Zimbabwe with no electricity or internet, that his reasoning for wanting to hold actual paper cash is primitive?

I think it holds better than you think; both shias and sunnis are sects of the same religion, islam. Just like bitcoin and ethereum are assets from the same asset class, cryptocurrencies.


I don't think you use the term "double standard" correctly here. A better word would be "subjective" and with that I would agree with.

Why would it morally gut the bitcoin ideal in any situation? People have this common misconception that an early adopter simply made one lucky decision and got unfairly rewarded for that. In reality early adopters have typically made the decision every single day not to sell. They have over and over again decided to believe in bitcoin and support it. So far it has worked out well, but there is also a lot of risk in such belief. In other words, the early adopters are not getting rewarded for believing in bitcoin once. They get rewarded for their continuous support and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:34:46
Then maybe they should go away? After all, there is plenty of necessary consuption to take care of in the world. You are basically saying that a system that prioritises labor for necessary consumption is bad?

You really think we have gone to a more capitalist direction during the recent decades? With the fed centrally planning the economy, money being printed like crazy and government regulations rising up everywhere. We are far from the capitalism of the 50's and 60's. The US has always been the last stand on earth for capitalism and now even there a self proclaimed socialist was close to winning the candidacy for president.

Reddit != bitcoin users.
I have an idea of what users think though, from the mining hashrate, btc value and bitcoin marketshare. And, probably to your disappointment, those metrics look awesome.


Interesting. Can you tell me how Satoshi designed bitcoin to work after the mining subsidies end, if not by a fee market?


He is a smarter guy than I am. If he says so, I'm more inclined to believe him than you for example. I know has bitcoin's best interests in mind, but I have no idea what your real intentions are. They might be benevolent, but I have no way of knowing that.


Why not sell it all and buy some alts?


Neither of us know what the market will do. But maybe you should stop telling bitcoin developers how to do their jobs, since clearly you are not more capable at coding cryptocurrencies than they are. Or if you are better, compete.

Bitcoins represent the accumulation of wealth. If you are anticapitalist, you should be against the accumulation of wealth. Thus you should be anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:51:13
It does mention that mining has "become very difficult due to improvements in hardware". It also says in the beginning that the computers are usually "specifically built for bitcoins" (=asics).
IMO it's better to speak of specialized computers (instead of using words like "ASIC") because that will make the concept easier to grasp for non-techies.

And perhaps the greatest reversal to come from deflation is going from debt slavery to financial freedom!

I have been through those emotions too. It happened several times that I told someone to buy bitcoins and then after they did the price crashed. Doesn't feel nice when it happens, but then the price went up Up UP and they thanked me.
I of course always tell them about the possibility of a crash.

Hardware wallets require electricity and internet.

It has it's problems just like the current way of using bitcoins has. The thing is, I'm pretty sure it will happen (if bitcoin will one day get mass adoption), so we should get used to the idea.

In a free market no transparency == no customers. Everyone can easily audit the blockchain in order to verify the reserve claims banks make.
Which bank would you trust your bitcoins to, the one with blockchain transparency or the one without?

Haha, more likely! ;)
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:41:49
Remember that the amount of money printing is also affecting the interest rates, so it's not just the what euribors and libors say. The more there is money on the market, the less the interest rates will be. And they are indeed close to zero at the moment. Interest rates that are lower than the inflation rate are definitely not a sign of healthy markets. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:13:49
That's true indeed. It should perhaps be titled "why bitcoin matters".
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:52:06
Read a book called "Human Action" from Ludwig von Mises. It makes an excellent point on how goverment interference in free market mechanisms can never do any good. The value of money and interest rates should be determined by free markets, not politicians.
As a side note, if bitcoin succeeds, I think it's likely to have goverment based deriatives like paper notes backed by bitcoins, which brings some of the manipulative powers back to governments.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:34:16
Here's our main difference I guess:
You think problems like this cannot be solved with smarter software. I believe smart software can solve problems like this easily.
The reason these things don't happen on Linux is that you would need to approve any changes like that with a root password. This makes Linux quite secure IMHO.
No, I don't believe Microsoft could have know about cryptolockers in advance. But they could have better safety mechanism in place, especially for basic users like older people. 
You don't need to block all encryption like the one used in browsers. Just put that browser in a special sandbox where it has no rights to execute code outside it's domain.
At the moment windows will allow a program downloaded from the internet, encrypt the whole computer without even asking for a password from the user. I think that is a bad thing. You say it couldn't be prevented and that is exactly where we disagree.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:58:07

I do accept that it could be worded differently. How would you present the essential concept of mining in a more newbie-friendly way?
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:41:41
Simple: Monitor that stuff, and give several security warnings before allowing files to be encrypted like that. This should of course be a feature "advanced users" can turn off at their own risk. It's not that complicated. 
Optimally when a person buys a computer, the operating system should be modified right there to adjust to the skill level of the user. Would solve a lot of problems like this. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:09:13

I would claim than people will still consume when they feel like the target of consumption is totally worth it. This mean less crap will be produced and more high quality things. People will not stop buying good things. Nobody wants to die sitting on top of a pile of bitcoins. People want to enjoy their lives and spend money on quality goods and services.

It's important to talk about these things. The bitcoin system is only as strong as it's weakest link. And we already know that anything centralised tends to be that weak link. Which is why we should worry about bitcoin foundation gaining too much power/influence.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:06:08
The problem with the status quo is the market manipulation. When central banks print large amounts of money and force low interest rates, they send false signals to the businesses. Businesses will start large projects that they wont be able to finish because the signals (of people preparing for future spending) have been false. Interest rates should be determined by free market mechanisms and not central banks.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:25:39
Bitcoin will give up to US government wishes and incorporate tracking mechanisms. That will allow it to become a mainstream cryptocurrency that is widely accepted by regulators everywhere.
An alt-coin with a promise of superior, never-to-be compromised privacy features will take away the hardcore libertarians and also the criminals from bitcoin.
Government will still have a problem. Just not with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:22:22
Not if the interest rates are good enough. People are willing to accept a small amount of risk if they get a decent reward.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:39:43
It's why you and me like bitcoin. But the same reason is why the masses don't like it. Regular people that are not so computer literate, will never be confident in storing their wealth on computers, when the security of the system in their own hands. They simply can't do it.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:14:29
Because of the lack of central banks.
@_date: 2013-11-15 11:49:10
While it's true that salaries might get lower to compensate for the deflation, this is much nicer than the current situation. Here's the reason: When our salary goes up due to inflation, it's already too late. The pay raises always react to inflation, which means there is a delay during which the inflation is already biting hard. Turn the system around, and we have a positive delay in which our money is always able to buy more first and our salary get's lower later.
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:18:08
I would again suggest that this is not a plausible way for NSA to gain cracking power.
Can you imagine the meeting in which some NSA nerd reveals his evil bitcoin-plan to crack some encrypted files? I mean talk about side-effects :D
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:20:13
No, I actually mean cash without any need for other than physical security. Pure paper notes, with no private keys in them. These notes will be redeemable for actual bitcoins. This system has it's upsides and downsides, but I'm arguing it is inevitable and essential for mass adoption.
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:00:50
Indeed, but they had clear motives for Tor. Plus they have admitted they can't control Tor, so that experiment ended up horribly for NSA.

@_date: 2013-11-15 19:31:16
It's deflationary already now, because people price the limited supply into the price of bitcoins. The ricing price causes more and more demand which causes more and more deflationry effects.

It's true that in some countries the smartphone adoption is fast, but even then they are definitely cash based societies. If having electricity (let alone 3G networks) is rare, then trusting your wealth on purely online systems is not very tempting.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:25:13
Indeed, but because the blockchain is so transparent, also the banks will be more transparent. That's why the fractional reserves will need to be larger in order to attract customers. The transparency will introduce competition between banks: Customers can choose if they want to store their bitcoins in a riskier bank (less reserves) that pays higher interest or a safer bank (large reserves) that pays smaller interest.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:10:30
No, this is what I don't realize. Here's the reason: the banks will work like they used to work when dollar was gold backed. That is much better than the current system. And essential for mass adoption. I also think it's an inevitable development because the three facts I outlined in OP. We should not (and probably can't) resist it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:12:38
"file encryption has many legitimate uses too"
That is of course true, but mainly for the advanced users. I think it's fair to assume that a person messing with encryption is likely to fall in the category of advanced users. And those could turn this feature off with a simple setting.
"This also isn't a Windows problem. And there are some features in Windows for this, like UAC."
First you say it's not a Windows problem and then you present a solution similar to it that is already in Windows. That clearly illustrates how this falls in the domain of OS functionality.
"But since this is so easy for you, perhaps you could explain how this would work to a simpleton like me."
By monitoring the use of encryption algorithms and prompting non-advanced users before allowing them to encrypt anything in the main file-system.
