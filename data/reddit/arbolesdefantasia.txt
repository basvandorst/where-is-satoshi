i dont' think that changing the bitcoin protocol in a negative way would cause any damage to the overall ecosystem because those who cared would be free to move the money to a different coin without the same restrictions. the fact that these coins are all liquid and easily convertible makes through decentralized exchanges makes this not so serious of an issue.

does any evidence indicate they are insolvent? i saw a recent post showing they made 1m usd in fees in the past few days. i would think that for the company to be insolvent despite earning so much in fees would mean insiders would have to be syphoning money out of the company fraudulently.

it is a cheaper payment network. it gives people for the first time a choice in what currency to transact in. and its a choice to transact in a currency that is decentralized, and therefore uncontrolled by governments. governments have a great deal of power derived from controlling the currency.

how does bitcoinbuilder manage to gain possession over the coins in mt.gox if mt.gox doesnt allow withdrawals?
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:26:39
good point. disregard my comment
@_date: 2014-02-15 05:00:18
what's the connection to this link and mt.gox actually allowing withdrawals? 
is it the whole thing relating to mt.gox not letting anyone make withdrawals because they want the code to change. and so once the issue in the link below has been resolved, mt. gox will resume withdrawals? what other reason does mt.gox have aside from this supposed security issue to not allow withdrawals?
is there any indication when this patch will be ready?

i was solicited recently via email by a group claiming to represent a class action suit against gox. they asked me to register with my email address and the amount of coins and usd i had in gox. was this a scam? if yes, how might it impact my claim against gox? i would assume these people might try impersonating me in order to gain access to my funds. what mechanism do you have to verify that the claims are being claimed by the true owner.

I would like to see $200-250. but $200-$250 would almost be too good of a buying opportunity. because then it would be a huge jump up to 2,000. I expect it to go sideways for a while, and maybe have some false breakouts. but volatility to decrease, but not sell off during this period.

@_date: 2014-04-08 04:30:03
the only additional assumption i made was that he was threatened, and it was more of a logical inference based on the evidence thta if he were threatened then he would be complicit in stealing the coins against his own will. its not an assumption that if he steals the coins he would destroy his business, reputation, and have legal problems for the rest of his life. technically its not an assumption that they were stolen. its a question of who stole them. i am assuming he was threatened. if he wasn't threatened then that would be one less assumption.

thanks, i found a comment on explaining the instant buy process


@_date: 2014-01-26 05:27:42
problem is that they have a 4 day waiting time to purchase coins if you dont have instant buy enabled.

the only explanation that i can think of is that he shorted the coins at a much higher price and is now covering his shorts for a profit.
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:05:08
if this is true, then its possible that by the time next friday roles around, the price at all the other exchanges will be trading lower (at around 300) also. instead of mtgox going higher to equalize with the other exchanges, the other exchanges will trade lower ot equalize with gox

by the time the usd is deposited in gox, gox will already be allowing withdrawals of btc, and thus the arbitrage opportunity will be gone.

the benefit of coinbase is linking it with your bank account. but whats the downside of using it? 
what do you mean its not an exchange? does it essentially just have a account of bitcoins that it purchases. 
it has a instant buy feature that says:


what does it mean that regular buys take 4 business days. does that mean that if i buy it today, what price do i get? the price where its trading in four days, or the price where its trading now?
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:58:06
really good graphs. did you create them or find them somewhere? only difference is that the most recent uptrend to 1k was significantly larger then previous upmoves, which could lead to a first break of the lower bound on this correction, if that happened which i think it more likely then another immediate up move, it would take at least another 6-8 months to resolve itself before another upmove

i agree, more diversity would lead to more debate and different opinions as to what direction we should go - in turn that would lead to deadlock where both sides disagree. i would think that a majority vote would be needed. its the same difficulty that arises in a representative democracy. but its better than alternative of a group of people doing what is best for 1% vs everyone else. now i am not saying thats what the situation is at the federal reserve, but theoretically you want your interest to be represented fairly. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 05:55:37
am i currect to assume that even though it takes 4 days to gain access to the coin, the price is based on when i initiated the purchase on day 1?
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:49:33
i am just speculating, but i think the reason for the price decline is partially insolvency risk, but more a result of nobody having USD inside mt.gox account with which to purchase bitcoins. that fact combined with everyone trying to cover the shorts they made for a profit. remember, as far as i know, the only exchange with which you could short is mt.gox. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 10:43:22
because people with similar background and upbringing who are serving in a position in which they are charged with representing the interests of a broad diverse group of people are less likely to do so effectively if they all share similar beliefs as a result of their shared background, whether its conscious or unconscious it will lead them to favor certain decisions over others - and they won't represent the diversity that reflects the people they represent in their capacity as directors.
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:44:35
agreed. in order for the price on bitbuilder to be equal to the market price on mt.gox it would have to be selling at a rate of around .56  
.8 is the bid to buy gox for btc. if you wanted to buy on the offer it would be .85. which is the equivalent of buying gox bitcoins at around $550 per share. (still $100 below market value of $650, but if you have usd in gox it would be better to buy directly on gox at $380 instead of through bitcoin builder at effective rate of $550). Assuming of course that you actually do have usd in gox to buy at $380. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:49:16
the xchange rate on bitcoin builder is currently .7btc=1goxcoin 
so people with goxcoins could sell 1 gox coin worth 285 for .7btc worth $458. essentially making a profit of $173
if only it were possible to deposit USD into gox right now and have instant access you could make a lot of money

in a panic scenario, a massive sell-off might occur, leaving the last people at the door with little value - but if a proposed change would cause that much of a disruption it wouldn't be implemented in the first place because not enough people would agree to it. the most extreme change that could be implemented would need some amount of consensus by the users before being implemented. having said that if a panic situation were to occur for some reason, this risk can be mitigated by diversification of holdings. 
such a scenario would be setback but also it would prove that the network is robust. its a constant cycle of creative destruction. if a new coin were to be developed that provided some massive comparative benefit to bitcoin, then people would leave bitcoin, some would stay. but it would create a richer eco system modeled on natural selection. like competitors in a free market. 
having a pegged exchange rate between currencies might reduce uncertainty were the value of bitcoin to fall. but the problem with fixed exchange rates is the value in relation to non linked currencies. so i am not sure if that would solve the problem or create a temporary solution. fixed exchange rates only make sense if both currencies are stable. but if one falls, then all the people who own the stronger currency are losing value as more people acquire the currency for less than its actually worth in relation to the weaker currency,

what could potentially happen is that bitcoin loses its position as far and away the leading cryptocurrency and a few other currencies rise relative to bitcoin in terms of percentage of the total market share. so that the best investment would be another currency instead of bitcoin.

blacklists and decentralized mining
i was reading some posts about government blacklists of certain coins. and if all the mining is consolidated between a few massive mines, the government can just mandate that these mines enforce the blacklists, whereas if network is decentralized the government wouldnt be able to enforce any of these blacklists. insert any word in for blacklists and the principle remains the same. when mining power is consolidated, the network becomes less robust and able to withstand attempts to regulate. 
defensive mechanisms and the inevitability of asics for any hashing algo,
alternatives to mining consolidation do exist, all the arguments saying otherwise, ie that asics are inevitable for any hasing algo, arent really that convincing. given that you can always fork to change the algo, or engage in other defensive mechanisms in order to make asics not cost effective.
market competition.
a space will always exist for coins that are not decentralized because they might offer services and features that centralized non asic resistant coins don't offer.
@_date: 2014-04-08 05:29:03
if this is in fact the explanation (he was not the person who stole them), we still don't know through what mechanism the coins were actually taken, who took them, and to what extent he was involved or was aware of it. and how he was not aware of it. and why he didnt take steps to protect against this kind of security flaw, or whether he was aware of it to begin with. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:32:40
occam's razor. why would he steal all these coins when he clearly would never get away with it, in the process he would destroy his business, reputation, and have legal problems for the rest of his life, unlikely. more likely explanation is they were stolen, but how could they be stolen unless he was complicit? explanation: he was forced to participate in the theft because he or his family was being threatened. he should have had protocols in place so that he wouldn't have this kind of power, so even if he was threatened he would be unable able to give the thiefs what they wanted.

how is it any different then buying and selling everything in cash? it can be regulated in the exact same way. the IRS was suiing someone who was using points gained in a "barter exchange". this is the equivalent. if you earn money in bitcoins, it would be just the equivalent value in dollars which would be owed for taxation purpose.s
