I was worried more about public figures besides Satoshi.  You don't need a million bitcoins (like Satoshi has), or even hundreds of thousands of bitcoin.  Today it only takes 130 btc to make you a bitcoin millionaire.  That's a whole lot of people.

Exactly.  By hand.  Where they can be caught and arrested.  It's the fact that you can transmit bitcoin without having any clue where the other person is that is the problem.


Serial numbers.  And while maybe you can do these things for small amounts of cash, moving millions in actual cash is incredibly difficult.


Not liquid millionaires who can transmit millions as easy as a text message and without the person receiving being traced.


All true.  But their wealth is not liquid in the same way that bitcoin is.  I cannot transmit the contents of my Fidelity account to a random person half way around the world, untraced.  I cannot liquidate it for a giant skid of cash either.  
The point is, the nature of bitcoin makes it a unique risk to certain people.

You can't transmit USD anonymously as easy as a text message.  It's fully traceable.  Also, it's less likely people know you are a USD millionaire.

What 'security' can prevent your child from being kidnapped (assuming they don't live at home)?  I think the issue here is how easy the wealth can be transmitted anonymously.
