What mining fees? If someone sends you BTC the fees are pennies. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:26:45
How much btc did you send and how much btc arrived. They probably just use a different exchange rate. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 01:50:06
No they didn't. It was just baked into their exchange rate

Convinced my business partners to accept bitcoin (letting me try it for a week) for our new company and I can't find a processor that can charge sales tax in just CA. Anyone know of who can or if I even need to? I do like how Coinbase offers a discount for bitcoiners and hope I can get it launched with the integration.

I am interested to see what happens to bitcoin's price after the event

Probably will launch along side of iOS 8.

Thanks for the boe link. I look into the api, i was hoping coinbase/bitpay would have the option built in like paypal
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:29:32
Yeah but not automatically based on location. I could make separate products: Product1 CA tax, Product1 no tax...

Awesome! So stoked on a bitcoin sale!! Shipping Monday

The problem with Trezor is the backend of myTrezor.com (used to send) is unreliable. I needed to send quickly today but had to wait until it came back up, ⌘-R, ⌘-R. I posted [this]( today.

They are advertising to those who don't know what satoshis are.

I was happy they stopped the common "send any amount, anywhere, for Free" lie

I just got my display in, excited to get this going.. I'm getting ```update-rc.d: warning: start and stop actions are no longer supported; falling back to defaults``` after setting to "anybody" any idea? a reboot just brings me to the terminal, how do you activate the site/gui?
edit: also running just ```xinit /home/pi/presentation.sh``` gives me no screens found, even though im seeing the terminal on the screen. thanks for the idea, and your help

I've heard a counter to that.. forget the details. If quantum computers break bitcoin they've done more damage to much more already.

You send a small fee for every transaction. These go to miners. When the 21mil gets hit bitcoin will either be able to support a fee market or it won't exist. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:35:30
They will mine for fees. "Fee market"

This is why Bitcoin is &gt;. As a protocol it can be implemented in ways like this, without having to work with 3rd parties.
@_date: 2016-05-16 06:06:55
as of now every 10min, 25 bitcoins are mined. when the halving happens 12.5 bitcions will be mined every 10min. supply rate

Right you are.  is from google but no longer exists. I got to step 3 on normal donate and no option either.
