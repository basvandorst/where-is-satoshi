Thank you. I am honestly confused how responsible breeders have become the villains, when it’s the animals that are irresponsibly or accidentally bred that are filling the shelters. If people were spaying and neutering their pets the way they’re supposed to, then responsible breeding would be universally accepted as the best way to acquire a pet.

That makes me curious about something. If everyone were to stop buying puppies from responsible breeders, and adopted instead, wouldn’t all individual breeds eventually disappear?

I honestly don’t understand the sentiment here. The problem is that there are so many accidental and irresponsibly bred animals, that the shelters are full of them. The shelters here in my community are full of pit mixes and mutts. Clearly the issue isn’t the responsible breeders, so I don’t understand how they become the villains in this story. If people were spaying and neutering their animals the way they were supposed to, responsible breeders would be a fine place to acquire an animal.
The problem is the people who don’t spend neuter their animals. The problem is people who let their animals roam the streets to get pregnant or to impregnate someone else’s pet. The problem is the person that says they want to let their dog have just one litter so they can “see what it feels like to be a mom”. That’s why the shelters are full of animals, those are the bad guys.

Wait, where are we getting that this puppy was sold in a store?

Actually, it just screams pet store. The picture wasn’t necessarily taken where she got the puppy, and it’s pretty common to head to the pet store after you acquire a new pet.
