I had no idea he was gay either until you mentioned it, but you shouldn't be shaming him just because he enjoys having a penis in his mouth, silly sir.

So does Luke Jr have the right to suck people's penises? Should he be insulted for simply following his sexual orientation?
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:08:56
Are you opposed to homosexual acts? 
@_date: 2015-08-03 07:39:26


Methinks you have no idea what that means.

He is our lord and savior, and you should be respectful, *or else*...
@_date: 2015-07-16 10:58:01
So... double penetration?

cheep cheep

Doesn't this mean, by definition, that those systems were indeed conceived?
@_date: 2015-08-24 18:38:18
Also, what's wrong with being an asshole?
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:24:02
Why do you think that he thinks that, silly sir?
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:20:58
How is someone asking for handouts "great exposure"? It creates a very negative association, if anything.
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:27:35
Better than "many buttery tastes".

Yeah, if he were a black gay transgender intersex individual, I'm sure his opinions would be worth so much more.
Why refer to his skin color or age?

That username made me think about oral sex.
@_date: 2015-09-07 10:58:55


Do you even *have* a vagina?
@_date: 2015-09-16 05:35:28
No, it's a "black man" argument, silly sir. The writer of the article is ethnically African-American. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 06:07:11
That's just like saying that ethnic Africans shouldn't be allowed to have sex with white women.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:30:07
There is nothing wrong about applying critical thinking.

Citation needed, silly sir.
