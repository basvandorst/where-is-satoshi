Oh grow up. Stop romanising something that can only be used to buy drugs and child pornography.
Walmart stock rises when Walmart reports high sales, or gets good PR. That is based in reality. Bitcoin just moves. It is useless as a currency. The dollar is rooted in the performance of the American economy, and the ability of the United States Government to pay bonds, that’s reality, and moreover it is useful as it is broadly stable.

It isn't though. The only name recognition it still possesses is 'that thing that crashed massively'. The crash demonstrated to the average person that higher prices do not lead to a safer investment. Continuing to talk about blockchain is pointless when Bitcoin is seen by most as an investment, and is manifestly useless as a currency due to fluctuations in value.

Except there is no guarantee Bitcoin will win in the long run.

It absolutely is. The ability to sell bonds is the sign of a strong economy and nation. If the US stopped honouring bonds, the dollar would crash. 


It cannot be stressed enough that the debt of a nation is not the same as household debt. There is nothing wrong with it.


The concept of fiat money is no different from bitcoin.

If you think bitcoin is useless as a currency, how do you expect it to hold long term value as an investment? People will stop investing. Not to mention no crash has been as high profile as this one.

If you pay for services with Bitcoin you are an idiot.

The problem is that changes in BitCoin value aren't really driven by reality. It just rises and falls depending on hype. There isn't any reason to believe it will survive 10 years.
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:18:47
It has dropped from 20 000 to 4 000 over the last year, how is that good?
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:32:57
It is though, because the price rises and falls irrespective of anything to do with the technology, which makes it both a terrible investment or currency to perform exchanges with. Why in God's name would I trade with something that's value can change by 20% in one day for no reason?
You have shifted the goal posts completely here from 'it was a great year' to 'it still can rise a lot'.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:03:38
I'm confused as to what this statement means. The coin is useless without a public that wants to use it, if the public have no faith in its value, that is objectively terrible for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:34:47
Yes, the dollar is struggling with maintaining a steady value, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:12:33
It doesn't matter what the fault is, it matters that it is objectively negative for Bitcoin. If someone breaks my leg, it isn't my fault, but it is certainly bad for me.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:08:32
That doesn't at all refute what I said. You have just admitted the wider public doesn't want anything to do with the product. How is this not bad for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:06:43
I was expecting it to crash and burn, and lose the confidence of the public, which it did. So to reiterate, how is that good?
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:29:23
But no one wants to enter the market, for the same reason no one is buying Iranian Rials. You do not invest in a currency whose value is sharply declining. I'm not even talking about a 'get rich scheme' how can you convince the average person to trade in a platform where his money has no fixed value?
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:15:20
Bitcoin is absolutely about stable value, because people will never store or move value with it whilst it is volatile in large number.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:38:18
Except the dollar is very stable in value. 
Edit: Bitcoin has lost $600 today alone. That's nearly 14% of its value. The USD has changed that much compared to the Euro in four years, it is far more stable.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:58:20
It will never be adopted as a useful currency if people only use it briefly for transactions. Moreover, even looking at short term transactions, yesterday people would have still leaked a lot of value in a matter of hours.
Hodlers are even worse, it makes no sense from an investment or usage point of view. If you believe in it sell at the high, then buy at the bottom to increase your total share. If you believe in it as a technology actually use the damn thing.
@_date: 2018-12-02 01:38:54
Losing a fifth of its value isn't remotely worrying to you in terms of the likelihood that tech will be adopted by any reasonable number of people?
