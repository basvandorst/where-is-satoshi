You’re right. Mining is all about getting the most work done for the least cost, which means the most profitable miners are the most efficient. 
Bitcoin wants and needs miners to the extent they protect the network, so in the end the only people who will continue to mine and reap the benefits will also be the most efficient.

There isn’t a cap at 1MB, with Segwit. You should read more about it. 
It’s less a scientific proof, than a social contract. We all want hard money with a hard cap, you can’t pay miners forever with block rewards so people have to be incentivized to pay for their block space. 
This is all in addition to verification of the blockchain. Ever try syncing a raspberry pi to the chain? It’s doable but might take like 2-4 weeks or more. (Don’t have a high end computer with money for later computer upgrades, don’t run ethereum node)
Also on the Pi, you feel like you’re verifying the blocks quickly at first and think you’ll be done syncing in a day or two, then you hit actually full blocks and it starts to crawl. These problems get compounded as you make blocks bigger. In the end leading to a less decentralized network. 
A start to potential avenues of research...

Bitcoin requires upfront investment in miners (continually ever few years) and continual investment in electricity.

I still think saying creating a channel between you and a vendor isn’t quite right. In the future, routing node operators and vendors could be quite different. 
Vendors will close and loopin/out channels as needed and so will buyers. 
You’ll be able to keep channels open for months or years at a time potentially. Don’t think of channels as a credit to any one single vendor.

So you have you 24 word seed phrase for BRD already right?
I would prefer to only work with a part of your funds for this test. 
Go to your ledger and initialize it, it’ll give you another 24 word seed phrase for the ledger wallet. 
Now make a small transaction from BRD to your ledger. 
Now go to bitcoin core or something similar, enter your 24 word phrase you got from ledger, and let it sync. 
You should now see the coins from the ledger available in this new program. Now both wallets are using the same key. 
After you recover from seed though you should consider the seed potentially compromised since it was typed on a computer. Send the balance from the bitcoin core back to your original BRD wallet, ( whose seed has never been online). 
Hopefully this helps. I know it won’t be perfect instructions but you will appreciate learning and going through the process.

We’ll have to wait for a more ingenious solution to solve this problem. Was just reading about this last night in bitcointalk, and it seems the core devs don’t see this as that critical of a problem as drives are only getting bigger, and machines faster, in addition the node count is increasing so obviously if you want one enough it is very much possible.

The more you get into bitcoin, maybe the more Bitcoin you have. Selling bitcoin for cash is against really the ethos of HODLing but by spending straight BTC, you get to signal to a seller to continue excepting and expanding their BTC product offerings. Also gives you more comfort in holding btc because you know you can spend it. 
Lots of good things come from using BTC to purchase mundane things and not just lambos.

Common denominator of a lot of different security schemes is multi-signature wallets. I think once it gets easier to do them with bitcoin core there will be a multi sig explosion of possibilities. 
The casa seedless model is interesting, they don’t have you backup seeds, just have multi-sig with hardware device, and if you lose a hardware device you just redo the multi-sit to replace the lost device, keeping the other devices the same.

I’ve heard about casa “rotating” keys in a multi-sig a few times. Does anyone know what that means? Do you have to send a transaction to a new multi-sig wallet containing a new key but keeping some old ones? Or is there another way to invalidate a key without sending a tx?

The needing a channel for each vendor is the biggest load of bs people ever say about LN. Think about possibility of opening and closing a channel at most once a quarter or once a year. In addition, you aren’t in a hurry to close the channel as it doesn’t really do that much for you so you can pay a much lower fee. All of this is going to create a more robust fee market, and a preference for not “needing” your transaction to be in the next block.

It works pretty easily on my Odroid/RPi node. I usually download releases and don’t compile go code. 
It allows you to refill a lightning channel with an on chain txn.

Some blocks are completely full, some miners mine empty blocks just with the reward, sometimes it only takes 2-3 mins per block, or 20+ minutes. 
Miners mine from the point of view of their personal node, nowhere else so there is no guarantees of a transaction until it is confirmed on the blockchain.

Blockchain app, while there are arguably better choices is infinitely better than keeping coins on coinbase or an exchange. We usually call this a “hot” wallet bc it’s on an internet connected device. 
My recommendation would be to try out a few different “hot” wallets, find out what UI you like, send money between them, maybe even restore your written down seed from one wallet into another different wallet, so you can learn how that all works. (Honestly most important skill in bitcoin)
Once you’re comfortable and are willing to invest in greater security, get a ledger, Trezor, coldcard, to be your long-term “cold” wallet.

I was able to move my lnd data directory from one machine to another, all the while the first machine had open channels, and I kept those channels once everything was up and running on the second machine. 
I asked first on the lnd slack, and they said as long as the same node isn’t online in two places your states should be ok. So as long as you killed the process or unplugged the first machine before booting up the second with your backup you are good.

Not everybody needs to be down in the nitty gritty. I would extensively research block.io, but sometimes an API/service will get you accepting BTC faster instead of bogged down in the details. 
Just how I’ve recently relented to my dislike of Amazon by hosting my database on Amazon RDS instead of my own docker container. It’s just one less thing that I can fuck up and have to worry about.

But that is the channel the business has with their preferred lightning routing node. It doesn’t make you close your channel with your preferred routing node.

You give the to_seed_word function data, and given that data you get seed words. If two people were to use the same exact input data they would get the same exact seed words output. 
If you were to generate seed words with a pseudo-random number generator, and an attacker was able to determine what your input to the to_seed_words function was, they’d have access to your wallet. 
Ledger wallets have a closed source RNG, others aren’t but have other trade offs. If you control the entropy, you can be the most sure that no backdoors to the RNG exists.

Sorry the jargon runs deep! 
A routing node is no different for any other node, the person just took care to keep their node online ~99% and to balance their channels (incoming and outgoing) so payments of all sizes can be routed through it.

Chargeback prevention is part of the reason why when you buy BTC on coinbase it takes 1-2 weeks (haven’t done it in forever cashapp ftw) before you get your BTC. So you can’t buy btc and then claim fraud to your bank. 
I imagine selling there has similar delays. 
For BTC transactions with no fiat involved it’s a non-issue. No givsies backsies so you better secure your shit.
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:36:53
They can only see the channel size if you’re a public node, not how much funds are on each side.

Just use lightning it’s freakin easy to integrate 
@_date: 2019-12-16 02:18:54
You’re totally right. I’ve invested a lot much time into learning, but that is the real value not the routing fees. I do think it is cool though that I may have helped 5-10+ people make a payment a little easier than before. 
One of my main observations though is because of how competitive the routing game is, Pis aren’t  ideally suited to be ‘fast’ routers, just because of the requirements to run the software. Ever since using a cloud VPS to run LND, and then I just use a remote BTCD node so it keeps the cloud costs way down have I started to get consistent forwards. 
Many people should just get a Breez wallet, or some other cheaper non-custodial wallet solution if they don’t want to route.
@_date: 2019-12-23 13:24:48

It just takes time, I got basically nothing for a long time. However I kept trying, getting better at rebalancing channels, selecting channels partners, and fee rates, and finally I’ve made maybe 50 satoshis this month, so around 50+ forwards.

Before they changed it, I was just able to copy and paste the address without all the other stuff.

I’ve been using python-mnemonic for generating seed phases, it’s made by Trezor. I’ve used the sha256 hash of an image as the input entropy for generating the phrase, so as long as I have the image around, I can keep generating the same seed.

I’ve also seen situations if you don’t close down cleanly it doesn’t save the progress. 
Maybe try and start it up and let it run for a bit, and then cleanly close and see if the updated state holds. Bitcoin is probably deep in thought, and your computer doesn’t like that for some reason.

The only thing I was explicitly told not to do was have the old node turn back on after the new one is up.

R/ethereum is having some fun debates with their POW change and eventual PoS.

From what I know, and I’m just learning myself. Older nodes think the the the UTXO is anyone can spend, at least that’s how it was for segwit. Check timelock is probably the same. The catch is if anyone actually tries to spend the UTXO all the other nodes in the system realize the issue and don’t pass on the transaction. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:14:36
On my most recent transaction my fee was:0.00000564 BTC
At this fee level, with BTC=$1,000,000 it would cost $5.64 in fees
The fee market is an amazing, fascinating thing that balances out difficulty, BTC price, and other factors like target confirmation time. 
We have 100 years but I think miners will be just fine.

Used to be a good option. I never felt like I could really buy from amazon from it, just a curated selection. 
I’d get shit reviews from the earners too because I’m not going to release your funds until the item is in my hands, sorry not sorry you have to wait an extra day.

No, but at least for me, since I couldn’t get access to the full amazon catalog, and I purchased enough SSDs I could ever want, the discount didn’t matter. YMMV
@_date: 2019-09-10 03:14:40
They haven’t even released what the bug is though. It doesn’t say potential loss of funds, but not in what way. 
Keep your lightning node updated, and cautious about not having more btc than you need on there, and you’re no more reckless than before.
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:32:06
They just updated their app, but I just tried it again right now and it still works.

I’ve used the “subprocess” module of python to call bitcoin core, and then I parse the results with the “json” module.

Then there are trade offs between different HW, fully open-source, closed-source, and some in between. 
The arguments for both are there, depending upon who potentially might want to hack you. 
I can’t wait for PSBT to be fully active in bitcoin core so I can have a multi-sig wallet with ledger and Trezor or ledger and cold card, and get the best of both.
@_date: 2019-09-17 01:30:35
You might say that, but I used the site many times. I tried all I could to purchase generic amazon items but it would say it’s not available, etc, and send me back to their curated catalog of buzzes, computer parts whatnot. 
I also don’t use chrome so I never installed their extension.

You should display the payment request in addition to it in QR format. It helps a bit depending on how your node is setup.

I like satoshis and think we should always display with 8 decimal places
Ex. Ew you paid 20000 satoshis to get on chain? No I like to wait a little longer and only pay 2000-5000 satoshis.

I’m excited for the “confirm in x blocks” feature of closing and opening lightning channels. I think it will put a lot of downward pressure of fees, as you’ll be closing channels only occasionally and there is less of a rush to get confirmation with channels than direct payments.

I’m not in finance, but I doubt just anyone can even get a seat at the table for many of the types of bets you have mentioned. 
Personally that all sounds like chaos, and a zero sum game. I hope BTC goes up because it’s utility gets unleashed by developers and everyone can take advantage of that utility if they become a part of the system.

Ethereum is what it is, but that doesn’t mean they haven’t changed what it is. They’ve fucked with their emission schedule more than once. At least monero has a long term strategy for emission that will likely hold.

Anyone know the best way to use your entire balance?

How to avoid retrying funding transaction over and over, removing a few satoshis at a time until the tx works, and then leaving you with a few satoshis in the funding wallet?

The miners don’t control the consensus rules, they just follow them. A change to the cap would be a breaking change and you would have two coins to choose from. And then the people (users) will choose for themselves the chain they think is better for them.
