Ahh I'm sorry, I got a friendly reddit DDoS and my website crashed about 15 min ago.  It should be back online if you'd like to try again.  It still might be running slow though.

No we don't have any of those. sorry.

Ego c-twist.  I loaded up on these since they are my best sellers and they are still in stock! :]]]

I have not contacted other wholesalers yet, but I plan to in the future to get a larger e-liquid selection :]
@_date: 2013-06-15 20:14:27
Thank you very much! I didn't know that subreddit existed :]

I have alot of other options than the ego. 
I personally use the Vamo V2
You literally get the amount of vapor of like a hookah. It's variable voltage so you can tune it to your preference and of course rechargeable.

I'm definitely going to talk to my accountant about the whole tax thing... but as of now, I have not liquidated any bitcoins that my business accumulated.  I plan on just paying taxes for the sales at the time they were placed as if they were in USD.  I don't think I get taxed on the gains from the value of bitcoin going up until I sell them.

fixed :]

Thanks for the tip, I'll add some more details in the near future.

The V3 JUST came out a few days ago. Some of the differences between the V3 and V2 is the look (of course), the V3 LCD screen has more pixles and therefore higher resolution.  The V3 also can unscrew at the top allowing for a cartomizer to fit more "freely" to allow for more air flow.
The new V3 can only hold an 18650 battery (larger battery) while the V2 has an extra piece which allows you to hold an 18650 or an 18350 (smaller) battery. 
The over all vaping performance between the 2 basically the same.

Sorry, we do not. We've ran into problems with customs and customers not getting their products so we just decided to only go 100% US.

My business sells electronic cigarettes AND accept bitcoins, we got tobacco companies spreading rumors "ecigs are a gateway to cigarettes" crap already.  Screw it, we accept bitcoins too, we know our customers are smart enough to filter out the lies. 
edit:  incase anyone was wondering

Good idea! I'll try to get some smaller bottles and put up a sampler pack :] Thanks!

Sadly we don't ship to Europe :/ Sorry!

Yes, we buy our e-liquid from mtbakervapor. All of our prices are the exact same as theirs for e-liquid, but we accept bitcoins and offer a wider  variety of starter kits than they do. :]

Sorry for not shipping outside of the US.  We've ran into problems with customs and customers not getting thier products so we just decided to only go 100% US.

Selling unflavored liquid never occurred to me, do you mean having literally just a bottle of plain VG or PG? Or do you like the unflavored stuff to have nicotine in it too?
@_date: 2013-06-16 17:20:40
Alright, I'll see what I can do to get that option on my site. :]
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:27:53
see above
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:27:29
I got this one from this vendor.  They accept BTC :]
