Well its not really a hub. 
Nodes / Computers / call them routers for the analogy are connected to other routers. In the end every router is / should be connected to every other router (optimal scenerio).
But A Node / Computer / Router / Switch will still not make a broadcast to all other Computers. 
Or? Or do I understand the lightning network wrong and it really is more like a hub than a router / switch?

Are you sure about that? I just zipped the monero blockchain (don't have a full bitcoin one) and it went from 40 GB to 33 GB using the fastest setting. Took me 10 minutes to compress.
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:17:11
Just scimming in. 
It is  89% complete now.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:30:22
Is the Blockchain / Blocks compressed? If no, Why not?
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:34:23
But why have 70 nodes only one connection?
As i understand it Nodes get a little bit of money if something is routed through them. So wouldn't it be incentived to have as many connections as possible. So that people take your path (since people will take the path with the least fees and least connections)
Or do i understand the whole shit completly false? (correct me if i do :) )

Is this testnet or people who compiled the lightning from github and use it already?

It gets better and better every year. Bitcoin / Altcoins improves. Today it is simple to create a wallet with a GUI.

One 8 MB block every 10 minutes means at worst 420 Gigabyte a year. 
I mean if the lightning network ever works than other coins will adopt the same anyway.

Why?  Wh should Bcash  be slower? The only diffrent is the Block size isn't it?
Their blockchain will grow 8 times as fast but their fees will be at least 8 times cheaper than Bitcoins. No matter the transaction volume. At least that is my understanding...

Only if you sell like 10000 USD worth of bitcoin in one transcation
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:29:35
yes. it is a bandaid till the lightning network works. What is wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:04:49
Moneros fees are also already pretty high. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:54:12
Why? 
Bcash doesn't have a larger Blockchain than bitcoin. And isn't a larger Blockchain kind of the only downside of an increased Blocksize?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:04:54
Moneros fees are also already pretty high. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:50:52
I mean. One day it will become a problem. But as long as the Blockchain is under 1 TB you don't really need to worry.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:11
others will probabably adopt something similiar in the end

New Pic. I want to see a new pic

DC current? I thought DC current was better (in the sense that its harder that it kills you)

what additional things do you need to answer my question? 
The fee is based on the bytes. And how much bytes are 25 € (which would be  0.0110 bitcoins currently? 
Can someone give those numbers into their client and look how much the transaction fee is? (if this is possible?)


You lost me there ;)
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:00:05
So if i want it in 6 hours i have to pay a fee of 0.0000006-0.0000009 bitcoins per bite. (i don't know what the orange and blue means.
Now i only need to know how much bytes a 25 € transaction has.
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:23:05
I am kind of a noob. What additional things do you need to know to answer the question in the title?
I want to send 0.0110 bitcoin (25 €)
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:41:18
I would send them from the bitcoin core client. I used to have him but it used really much space and i went for a SSD. So what would be the transaction fee be for 0.0110 bitcoins so that it takes approximatly 6 hours till confirmation. 
Can somebody look it up with bitcoin core pleas?
