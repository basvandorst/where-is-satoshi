That is an important observation, particularly that the system is not random but subject to rules that we establish.  It seems common of higher systems to hold lower systems, humans in this case, in distain and value only direct contributions to the well being of the higher system. Sadly, in the case of the current financial system, this higher level system is a poor reflection of basic human values.  But Bitcoin is changing these rules is it not?

Isn't Apples approach to payments analogous to their approach to the music industry? Apple was able to convince the music industry that hanging on to the old business model of retail physical sales was hurting them, and to embrace digital music through iTunes.  ITunes did not become the monopoly of digital music, rather music is now traded at a much lower cost.
By convincing banks and mainstream retailers to accept digital payments, Apple is convincing them to drop the antiquated payments model.  IMHO, Apple Pay will no more have a monopoly on e-payments than iTunes has on internet music sales, but digital payments will become acceptable to the mainstream.  And that is good for Bitcoin.

I know that in Angola, the Ambundu harvested the cowries on the Ilha de Luanda, which became a seat of power and was known as the central bank of Kongo. 
Most sources in this are in Portuguese.

From Wikipedia: "When Paulo Dias de Novais, a Portuguese navigator, arrived here in 1575 with several hundred soldiers and settlers, the island was inhabited by the Axi-lwanda, a subgroup of the Ambundu people which was tributary to the Kongo Empire. The island was an important location to collect zimbo, the shells that constituted the currency of the Kongo king before the arrival of the Portuguese.[2] The Portuguese settled here for a while, gaining control of the currency, before they decided to establish themselves on the mainland, opposite the island. They started to use the name of the African inhabitants as a name for the island and the town, spelling it first "Loanda" and then "Luanda"."

Everyday person here.  Spend some bitcoin, save some bitcoin, and make it part of your life.  Look at what you spend your money on now, and ask how you can use bitcoin for the transaction.  Then ask how you can save money by using bitcoin for the transaction.  Use some small amounts of money to try different services.  
Bitwage is a great way to commit, that you can change at any time.  For me Bitwage is a much cheaper way for me to convert fiat to BTC, because my employer pays any bank charges and currently Bitwage does not charge a fee.  Along with Bitwage I use their integration with Bitreserve and Xapo. Bitreserve allows the value to be held in bitcoin, USD, CHF Gold etc which is a good way to manage risk and volatility, and it is completely integrated with Bitwage.  Xapo is also integrated, and they issue a debit card.  This approach is cheaper than my current bank (UBS, current employer of Phil Gramm, ["the Forrest Gump of financial calamity"]( After one year if this approach continues to be cheaper and easier I will divest from UBS for day-to-day banking.

Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting) sets up many of the world's accounting and financial systems and has $28 billion in annual revenue.  Accenture’s group chief executive for financial services claims immutability as a weakness, justified by "...demands of the real world, where some things simply need to be struck from the records." So they are working on blockchains that can be amended or redacted (with appropriate governance). 
Maybe I am a 'purist', but in my view, if transactions can be reversed or redacted then it is not a blockchain.  If you have a business case that require reversal, then create a process that enables a second transaction between the parties.  If you have a business case that requires redaction, why use a block chain?  
If we take [Accenture's behavior]( as an example of the "real world" referenced in his quote, then I understand his desire for a ledger that he can edit.  Over the next few years the industry will sort out what is appropriate for this technology.  He should take comfort that his NY Times article is published using technology that can be redacted.

It's not true that the act of lending is separate from the currency being lent.  USD requires a loan to put new money into circulation. Changes in supply of USD changes lending practices. For example, high supply pressures bankers to create more loans and find new markets, such as developing nations.  Conditions of the WB development loans are a way of controlling behavior of entire nations.  Bitcoin, in contrast, is created by proof of work so for IMF or WB to get their hands on amounts of bitcoin that could finance today's wars, governments would have to tax the hell out of their populations and then send the btc to IMF and WB to lend, and that level of taxation would not be acceptable to populations.
