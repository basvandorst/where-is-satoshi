They would only need to plant seeds of uncertainty as they perform the attack. The community should take care of the rest.

When purchasing small enough blocks of coins, the buying activity will not be noticed.  The selling activity, coinciding with a coordinated smear campaign would be designed to raise eyebrows and make people question their fundamental belief in the success of the system.  The long-term trend of Bitcoin would be downward.  Speculators alone won't be able to sustain the market as the underlying purchasing ability of a Bitcoin is falling.

Although it is true that Bitcoin can operate with only a handful of nodes on the internet, after successive rounds of this attack, the exchange rate would likely collapse.  People would have **no technical difficulty** in transacting, but their exchanges would be in a **near worthless** currency.  Thus, the overall volume of real transactions would fall to a nonthreatening point where governments are comfortable.

Although remaining miners may mine more Bitcoins, each coin would be worth less.  Repeated supply shocks would devalue each coin to a price point where it would not matter *how many Bitcoins* you have.  The exchange rate is the focus of the attack.

That would leave unwanted footprints - a fork in the block chain would be detectable.  Also, an economic attack vector wouldn't require millions since the daily transaction volume on the Bitcoin exchanges is relatively small.

Daily transactions can already be manipulated with less than 100,000 USD.  ASICs would cost millions, as you say.

It sounds like you are operating under the assumption that Bitcoin is not a safe investment?  If more people agreed, governments have nothing to worry about.

Assuming this attack were initiated in several iterations, the long-term trend of Bitcoin valuation would clearly be downward.  Traders can/will turn a profit as Bitcoins fall - this may actually amplify the pace of currency devaluation.

While there may certainly be people that hold out, hoping things will turn around, this sounds more like gambling than a sound investment strategy.  I would imagine people with this type of conviction will be the die-hard supporters.  For everyone else, Bitcoins would just be seen as a dying asset class.

Buying into a falling asset class that cannot retain its value (due to a malicious attacker in this scenario) requires a discipline that borders on religious faith.  Would the average user care (or even understand) if the fundamentals are sound?  I don't believe the assumptions I've made are unfair - I would argue it is an extension of simple human nature - panic is irrational and contagious.

With repeated attacks, the equilibrium of the system will continue falling.  After each iteration this attack, it would actually be cheaper to initiate (since Bitcoins will cost less).  The resilience and patience of the community will be tested - I suspect their resolve will not last a few rounds of this attack.

The exchange operators would likely view the sell-off as a result of the FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) being injected into the community via social networks.  It would be difficult for anyone to tie this activity to a government - it is more likely to be viewed as panic selling.
