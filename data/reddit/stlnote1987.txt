I’d say if they don’t shit their pants and hold it for a few years it’ll be one hell of a payoff on that gamble.  Only ppl gambling are those trying to day trade and time the market.

I love how every post I read the OP knows exactly how shit is gonna go!  Must be so cool to know the future!

If it hits $100k I’d def sell.  Then wait for the inevitable correction back to around $20k and I’d more than quadruple my position.
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:20:03
Thanks McFly!  What else happens in the future??
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:40:56
So if you used your bitcoin today to buy something and tomorrow the price jumped up to $100k you wouldn’t feel like a dumb ass for essentially paying 90% more for it?
@_date: 2019-08-01 17:31:27
There’s been 80%-85% corrections after each ATH.  What are you thinking will differ this time?

Yeah I’ve been verified already. At least to buy bitcoin which I have with the app but you’re saying there is another verification process to withdraw to my personal BTC wallet? If so that sucks bc the verification process I previously went thru was awful as they would tell me I was verified and then when I went to purchase BTC was asked to be verified again.  It was def an annoying process.

Never heard of this block stream green wallet.  What’s the scoop? I’ve been using the iOS HODL wallet.  Would you recommend I look into possibly switching?

I can def see that being the case.  But until whatever happens happens I guess we are all guessing ����‍♂️

Agree with everything you’re saying but who’s just driving around with their $50k?

No we won’t

Pretty positive the halvening price is already baked in.  Everyone knows it’s coming.  Does everyone think that on that day everyone is going to all the sudden realize what’s happening and skyrocket the price?
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:27:16
Plenty of other ways to get food on the table homie.  There are many sustainable energy sources out there.  It’s 2019 not 1925
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:08:23
That’s true.  But that’s a hard pattern to argue with is all I’m saying.
@_date: 2019-10-09 13:11:46
What does the price of ones car mean in comparison to driving around with large sums of cash?  And even if someone is driving around with $50k or more in cash what are the odds they will randomly be pulled over, searched, and have their money seized?  This isn’t Nazi Germany so I think 99% of the time anyone in that situation would be just fine

Trump will also surely be gone this time next year and he’s not outlawing crypto by then.  Just isn’t happening.  Even the rednecks who voted for him the first time around can’t truly be dumb enough to sign up for another 4 years of his idiotic rule.  Guy is a fucking clown plain and simple.  I just don’t see any US authority shutting down crypto.

My Coinbase app also stuck at $8,484.63 this very moment.  Wonder what’s going on
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:13:37
Some ppl claim the price spike has already been built in some way it will explode but I say no one truly knows. Just have to wait and see.

Thanks for the info!  I am very happy with the HODL wallet and the research I did prior to using it suggested it was a very secure wallet.  Easy to use, simple and to the point.  I still downloaded Blockstream green and will keep it as a back up bc it’s def nice to have options in the ever changing world of crypto
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:12:22
Are these ppl being told that they could almost instantly cash it out for $10k?  I feel like they aren’t being educated on the price of BTC bc if they were then there’d be zero ppl who would take $1 over $10k.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:57:15
He also said $10k for 2017?  Bout $10k off
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:27:51
According to my Dick line we are just under $12k
@_date: 2019-10-05 13:58:30
Well price movements before and after I can see.  I feel like so many ppl tho are expecting a huge price spike the day of.

I wonder if that’s how you’d talk to someone face to face if they asked you that?  My guess is no and that you’re a dumb little keyboard warrior twat who would never have the balls to do that shit to someone’s face.  Settle the fuck down he just asked a simple question “DUMBASS”

Sorry to hear that bro.  Where’d you go in Italy if you don’t mind me asking?  My wife and I just took our 2 year old to Rome and Venice and went up into Tyrol in the Dolomites.  Personally, I hated Rome, it was a tourist trap.  Beautiful architecture and history but the African (mainly) ppl there tricking you into trinkets and such at every turn annoyed me to no end.  Venice on the other hand was pretty awesome.  Vatican City was beautiful seeing the cathedral and Sistine Chapel and everything.
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:11:40
How exactly do you withdraw it to your own wallet?  When I press withdraw it just says “confirm withdraw” leading me to believe it’s just gonna withdraw back to my bank acct linked to my Cashapp acct.  they never give me an option to put in my wallet address?  Thanks for any info you may have!

@_date: 2019-09-23 14:40:09
Find me where in my post I said that ppl said it was going to take BTC to an ATH at all?  Overgeneralization on your part.
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:51:17
Appreciate the heads up!  Just downloaded the wallet to my iPhone and I’m gonna play around with it tomorrow!
@_date: 2019-09-21 23:34:16
I’d say BRD is your best bet.  BRD staff has no access to your wallet it’s protected by the encryption in your iPhone.  Someone would have to have access to your seed phrase and passwords and everything to hack you.
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:54:14
Well, I this case, it is plan B seeing how Fiat has ruled supreme for over a century soooo.  What’s the issue? Bitcoin is an escape plan from the horrid fiat system.  A Plan B, if you will.

Everyone obviously never literally means “everyone” unless you’re talking about a small group of ppl.  I would think most ppl would understand this and take it in the way it was meant to be taken, but I see that was expecting too much.  How about this.

Hope this satisfies you.

Android is absolute ass.  If I want a phone with constant pop up ads and constant privacy worries someday I’ll give it a go.  Until then I’ll stick with apple.  And they are saying this phones price will be between $200-$400.  Not sure how that’s not extremely cheap?
