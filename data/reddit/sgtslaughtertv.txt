Make sure you mock them for not riding horses to and from work and to and from school. They would have to be crazy to burn the excrement of dead dinosaurs in some metal box called a "car" to get them to and from work. Horses are practically free, express their concern for the people riding them, and only need to eat grass and drink water. Horses are clearly the best form of transportation.

Feel free to shoot me down if I am providing incorrect information.
Right now, everyone's **common** incentive to see the Lightning Network succeed is embedded in the future prospect of mass bitcoin adoption. I don't know what wallet developers, if any, are paying their staff to develop these wallets to be easy to use and effective. One counter-example I can think of would be how Binance acquired Trust wallet and, therefore (I would guess), Trust wallet staff are being paid to do the work and do it well, but I am unaware of any lightning implementation from Trust Wallet. In my mind, as someone who has never used lightning before, I personally believe that simply *hearing* that you must stake your bitcoin to open a node sounds a bit like a downer. That's bitcoin you can't use for transactions.
I, personally, only remember being around for the 56k days of the internet on AOL. Back then, AOL was paying their devs to crank out easy-to-access AOL internet services.
EDIT: Added the word "common" with bold print.

Basically a lot of wallets are not "nooby friendly" or "normy friendly." The guy in this video is traveling so much to talk about bitcoin that he no longer rents an apartment in his home country.

Titles can only include so much information, here is what's most important about this segment an Andreas's conclusions:         
Andreas himself is a coder. He understands the development capabilities of bitcoin, and he's been in bitcoin since 2012 (sure, not *quite* the beginning, but very close). He makes these comments and they sound like water-tight "development theory", but of course if he believes these simple improvements can be made (say compare 1995 dial-up to modern day 5g or Fiber-optic Internet), then I have no reason to disbelieve him.
EDIT Reason: simply --&gt; simple.

This is a topic that has kind of been discussed already. 
Do you remember hearing about the Binance hack not even a year ago? 7,000 BTC stolen? Do you remember the CEO of Binance proposing a "roll-back" 51% attack by talking to the big Chinese mining pool owners?
Not only were the big Chinese mining pool owners against it, everyone was shitting on  because he had the money to cover the theft.
The bigger question to ask, then, becomes "What would incentivize all of the Chinese mining pools to conduct a 51% attack?"
@_date: 2019-07-10 07:11:43
This will inevitably increase the Facebook's advertising power.
Imagine you use libra to purchase a 12 pack of Monster on Amazon (if, hypothetically, possible). You'll start seeing ads on Facebook for Red Bull, Rock Star, and other energy drinks simply based on your purchasing habits.
This could even lead to a two-tier advertising system where advertisers are charged more money to advertise to users based on their purchase history, as opposed to what Facebook Fanpages they follow.
EDIT reason: spelling.

To be entirely honest, I think that any bitcoin under 1 million USD (today's dollars) is extremely good value. Hal Finney himself said that if bitcoin were to replace the world's monetary supply in 2008, then 1 BTC would be worth 10 million USD.
Now if you want a more "complicated" and non-clairvoyant point of view, I think we'll (eventually, sooner or later, but most likely much later) get to 3-5 million USD / bitcoin because of the altcoin space. In May of 2018, BTC dominance was what? 33-35%? Now it's at 67%?

Context: The game that shroud is playing is called "Escape From Tarkov". It's a first person shooter where you play through each map repeatedly and buy weapons and equipment by selling the loot that you find in each map. In the game you can find (fake/Imaginary) bitcoins and then sell them in game for money that you can use to buy more weapons and equipment. Of course you can also loot other weapons and equipment and loot (jewels, diamonds, antiques, PC hardware, etc.). Bitcoin isn't the main focus.

But who, realistically, has the capital it takes to game those smaller networks and why would they waste money doing it?           
I'm a moderator at and I know which projects are being ~~shilled~~ astroturfed and "promoted" by reddit users with shady post histories (hell, this is something I knew long before I joined as a mod) and none of them are in the top 50 or top 100 AFAIK.
Some PoW altcoins could be 51% attacked for a few million dollars (and this has happened already), but in today's world with the bitcoin network it would take so much time and money to execute this that it is entirely unrealistic, and by the time you possess enough hashpower to conduct the 51% attack, the hashpower has already grown to a level you can't keep up with.
EDIT Reason: Clarity.

Shortest summary I can make - friend of mine in Taipei, Taiwan made a video on this last night. Bitcoin still cannot be used in transactions (as far as I know) outside of Hainan Island in the near future, bitcoin is treated like controlled substances in some countries, but owning an excessive amount of it won't get you arrested.
Bitcoin in China is still not legal tender, and thus cannot be used in transactions. Technically it's just like digital gold, but you literally can't buy or sell it in China, whereas gold can be bought and sold in China, but not used in ordinary retail sales.
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:03:39
This is just what I would do:              
-create encrypted thumbdrives for the number of people you will give your BTC to. If you have three family members who will have it, make three encrypted thumbdrives.             
-Write the names of the benefactors on the thumbdrives (if possible).              
-Leave a physical note with the thumbdrives that will tell the beneficiary how to unlock the USB. For example, if it's your wife, I would write something like, "This thumbdrive will ask you to punch in a password. The password is the date that you and me first got dinner in number format (YYYYMMDD)." or "The password is the name of the school you and me met at with no spaces."              
-Send the BTC to the corresponding thumb-drives.             
-If you want to be really safe, consider doing the entire process on a new computer that has never connected to the internet, or simply reformat your original computer and don't connect to the internet.           
-For the sake of the beneficiaries you can instruct them in the thumb drives to download an app to their smart phones to avoid getting hacked.

In China this very much so digs into murky legal terms. 
I would say the environment in China right now is probably equal to video game skin sites for games like Dota 2 and csgo back in 2015 globally. I'm not joking. Reason why any action was taken by the legal system of Shenzhen is because of the value of BTC in US Dollars and not Renminbi.

something that the people at Bakkt **must do** to make sure they have their ducks in a row:
1) Set a minimum purchase to no lower than 90 USD (see reason 2).     
2) Once minimum purchase is complete, ensure that buyer's BTC is secured properly in a ledger nano S.
3) Any subsequential purchases of BTC afterwards should not require a minimum purchase.

To his defense, he most likely speaks three languages (Turkish, Italian, and English no matter funny the latter of the three sounds coming from his mouth), and he has a PhD in economics, and by the looks of his gray hair, I would say he had to do his research without the liberties our generation had.
I get this drift from watching him that says, "I know what is going on around here. You kids can't prove me wrong."

Seed Words will reveal a "private key" - **never give these words to anyone.**
The "private key" will allow you to recover the bitcoin - **again never give this to anyone.**
**Public addresses are harmless for everyone to see and know.** Useful analogy: A bitcoin address's "public address" is available for everyone to see. It is ok for other people to see this. It's like your real life address, people may know it, but they cannot get in to your address without the proper **key**.
Something else that might happen, you might get a message from the grave from your husband if he has used this website: [ \- he might leave you instructions on how to use it that eventually get emailed to you.
Putting the last paragraph simply - watch your email, your phone text messages, and similar contact methods carefully. Your husband might have written you a message that tells you how to get the bitcoin and how to use it a while ago in case he died. I've personally thought about how to get my family my bitcoin if I pass away suddenly. **This should be a fully automated system, not a human being helping you.**

The author is extremely delusional. Even if bitcoin was "the standard" tomorrow, then the Uzbekistan government would simply sell oil to China and Russia all the same and take the payments in bitcoin. He even pulled the, "Hong Kong protests are good for Bitcoin" meme - such a far cry from the truth.

Quickly note this guys, these are strictly **English-Speaking** youtubers who cover crypto. There are some big guys doing this in other languages (Spanish, Mandarin, French, German, Portuguese, Korean) that have not been listed here either.
EDIT: additionally, words that you speak are automatically transcribed in to closed captions for youtube. In an unrefined example, you could upload a video with the title [completely irrelevant by the way] "HI GUYS" and then in the video if it's only ten seconds long and you say, "I like purple kittens", then the words you spoke will become searchable on YouTube.

Learn how bitcoin wallets function before you do anything else with bitcoin. Buy a small amount (like 20 or 50 USD worth, 100 USD max). Dos and don'ts are as follows:             
-**Don't** post about bitcoin on your social media or let anyone know you are buying bitcoin. Since you're studying law, then you should be aware that if I have you first and last name and the state you live in, I'm just one google search away from obtaining the rest of your personal info.                
-**Don't** let anyone know which exchange(s) you are using to buy Bitcoin. If I have all of your personal information and know which exchange you use I can contact customer support, pretend I am you, and log in and steal your bitcoin.                         
-Do download some form of antivirus app for your smart phone.             
-Do learn the difference between a custodial and non-custodial wallet.                 
-Do learn the difference between cold storage and using a wallet.                
-**DO NOT EVER** give anyone your private keys.            
I might edit this post to add more info.

this politician in particular is actually anti-all-crypto.
Libra acts as a financial service in theory (IMO a much more flexible version of paypal if it ever gets off the ground), but I hate libra for other reasons. Skip to the bold if you're interested.
The guy who blasted zuckerberg is the same guy that proposed the USA illegalize bitcoin and all crypto.
**Why I hate libra:** it's like whatever currency you use now + spyware combined. If Libra launches and reaches a "stable" or "We accept Libra here" is posted on every store in the country, your life on Facebook will be hell. This is facebook advertising 1.0: Bob likes Ford's facebook fanpage. Toyota wants to put advertisements in front of all users eyes that like Ford, including Bob (this advertising model has been the norm since Facebook launched advertising). Facebook Advertising 2.0: Bob bought a Ford Mustang sports car and his payments are made with Libra. Facebook picks up on this and starts shoving advertisements in front of him that go well with his Ford Mustang: Tire Plates, Premium exhaust pipes, window tinting solutions, dashboard accessories, and pretty much anything you can think of. 
Maybe the above isn't feasible (since I've never made car payments with a CC or cash), but lets look at it a different way. Alice buys a motherboard on Newegg. She pays with libra. Aliice now starts seeing a lot more GPU, CPU, RAM and other DIY PC ads on her Facebook feed.

EDIT: Let's assume you are user blockchainfinest. You might have just shamelessly admitted to using two accounts in a thread where you are promoting bitspark. That in and of itself is not a problem (but you're in violation of rediquette doing so), but you saying "expressing my opinion" and saying "bitcoin solves this problem" while police are demonstrating use of excessive force in hong kong is fucking absurd. In fact, your comment in that very thread was shadowbanned. 
Secondly, you are one of the reasons why people cannot take bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies seriously. "Bitcoin solves this problem." Alright, so let's talk about the protestor who got the shit beaten out of him. How will it help? Maybe he could've bought 5 bitcoins in 2012 for 100 USD each and now they are worth 35,000 USD. Maybe they'll pay for some fines he faces later (if any, and if he cashes out) and his medical bills (again if he cashes out). You cannot eat a bitcoin. A bitcoin will not block bullets being fired in your general direction, and bitcoin does not act as a first aid kit when you have been mortally wounded. Use your head.
EDIT 2: I love bitcoin, but there are questions you literally cannot answer "bitcoin" to.  "What is 2+2?" "Bitcoin?" "What did you have for dinner?" "Bitcoin." "Who was the first president of the United States?" "Bitcoin."

While a majority of my crypto portfolio is composed of bitcoin, I must stress that the KYC process to purchasing on exchanges is precisely the process that makes bitcoin centralized.

He went in to an thread where cops were filmed committing police brutality and he simply said, "Buying bitcoin is the best protest available." (by the way, the mods shadow-censored his [comment]( in that thread and I don't blame them for doing it either).
Add to that his post history shows two weeks of activity / inactivity in one page, and the thread you and I are talking in is about Hong Kong. I don't think this is just some weird coincidence. Also other accounts that have commented here have somewhat obscure post history.

Well I guess I can ask you my question that I posted elsewhere in this thread: 
@_date: 2019-12-24 07:26:22


I speak, read, and write Chinese. The Hong Kong protests have nothing to do with Bitcoin. The Hong Kong protests were sparked because a bill was introduced that could see criminals face trial in Beijing for a "crime" they commit in Hong Kong. This is equal to saying you commit a crime in California against another person from California, then being extradited to Florida to face trial for committing that crime in California.
EDIT reason: clarification.

But how "automated" would a system be if I were to use my bitcoin for something my country's government doesn't agree with? I think no one's put a great deal of effort in to this because I could simply find a mixer and use multiple wallets to store my BTC, thus making it more difficult for the government of the country where I live to track it.

Just saw another video from [august this year]( where he seems to think that Bitcoin was made by a company. He doesn't fully understand the underlying technology, so I don't think he is qualified to speak on bitcoin.

I made this comparison about a week ago for quantum computers and cracking SHA-256 encryption... Hope the same applies here:
We have a daily gym class from March 2018 until now. In the class, we have jon google, dale IBM, and Jason Deepmind. Every day, all three of these kids do weightlifting for a year.
Today all three of them come out and boast their results / changes. Dale IBM, through his glasses and parted teeth proudly proclaims, "Guys, I can bench-press 110 pounds!", Jason Deepmind looks at Dale IBM with his acne and newly-tightened braces, laughs and says, "Bro, that's nothing! I can bench-press 130." then Jon Google looks at both of them and howls with laughter saying, "You kids think that's something? Try benching 150 pounds like me!" Then the gym coach, Mr. SHA-256 comes out, takes off his windbreaker, presents his massive biceps and says, "If you boys wanna break my record, you're gonna have to bench 1,000 pounds."
They'll be training until the **end of our lifetimes before they will be able to do this.**

I personally feel like the number necessary to reach 3.5% could be 3.5% of Any Given particular population. For example, in Japan Bitcoin is an official currency and 7% of people are looking to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. by that logic, I would say Bitcoin has definitely hit the 3.5% rule in Japan. Back in 2016 I remember meeting with my dad and he was talking to me about money and he said that people withdrawing their money from Banks and storing that money in a safe at home is a thing. They've had to deal with negative interest rates for a while now.  but life as usual carries on for these guys.
EDIT: to double down on this point, I'm sure 90% of readers of this sub could name 10 Hollywood actors before being able to name 10 Japanese or Korean actors. this is because we don't speak, read, or write korean or Japanese.

I worked in computer Hardware manufacturing for about three years. I have never once taken a trip to Australia. But I had co-workers in our Australian offices and I I have never once heard of anything like this law. Are Australian citizens exempt? Another thing is I imagine that if my co-workers from HQ went to Australia maybe they wouldn't take their laptops with them specifically to skirt this law. But I would see that as a big hassle. If at any point I had contact with anyone from Australia it was usually them flying to HQ (in Asia).

In the words of Hal Finney, if Bitcoin were to replace all of the money in the world economy then one Bitcoin would be worth ten million US dollars. The lowest Bitcoin dominance I've seen is at 30% so I think any price below $1000000 is a steal.
