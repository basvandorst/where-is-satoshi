That of course assumes there is no artificial limit on the amount of transactions that can go into a block.

Could you define spamming in your terms? Are you talking about number of inputs/outputs?

It's not the first time his "Simple" attack has been proven to ignore economic incentives.

So the most down voted comments are at the top. Wow that seems useful /s
@_date: 2016-06-10 13:51:34
That would not cause the transactions to flat line. Unless bitcoin  transactions are limited for some reason.
@_date: 2016-06-07 05:39:54
Link or it didn't happen 
@_date: 2016-12-06 13:20:22
It would not be depriving you of your pocket money, but your ability to spend any of your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:06:06
Woosh....   
@_date: 2015-08-26 06:42:26
Um, I think that's called voting after the fact.
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:23:48
OK, I can buy that. So what are your plans for the block size limit in the short term, while these issues are being worked on?
@_date: 2015-08-11 05:37:55
This really says a lot about you. Thanks

This is exactly what Bitcoin needs. An idea that has been rattling around my head is to create a fork of Core that with its default settings would be identical to Core. Any major changes like increased block size could be enabled with configs. Currently this is beyond my capabilities though :(
@_date: 2015-09-07 06:48:08
At that scale. That you are not able to adjust. (At least on mobile)
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:11:07
How about d-day.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:19:32
Seems to be up again.
EDIT: No, down again!

Someone's been asleep for a good year.
@_date: 2016-05-19 05:19:22
There is one more thing that could easily be added to that list that would guarantee an up trend. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 08:55:46
If your bank is not able to process your transaction because the base currency can only process 4 transactions per second. Who do you blame if not the people restricting it to 4tps?

I am Dutch born, grew up in England, my wife is Asian. We now live in France and no doubt our son will be Frence. We pay our social contributions clame our social benefits and are well accepted here. I can think of plenty of countries we can move to if we see fit. Of course others don't have these liberties yet but I think your "generally" is an over statement.

"and then verified on a clean computer that could not have been tampered with"
When I read this I assumed Gavin bought a cheep laptop or used one he brought with him to verify the SIG's on. Some how that computer was not clean. We will only know when Gavin speaks up how that happened. I bet he is verifying the NDA is invalid before doing just that.

Is there a particular reason for asking this question? Just curious if there where known issues before.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:26:07
Have you ever thought that you might be missing the point?
@_date: 2017-06-01 03:34:08
I spend all my time on the other sub and hardly ever do I see a comment by a minor. Mostly I see users posting links to minor's tweets.

If bitcoin can not be used for everyday purchases, how can it be used for dark payments. In both cases most of the time fees are above 10%. And there more anonimas coins that also have lower fees.
