The exact steps I took:
Uninstall catalyst with the 13.2 executable.
Follow step 1 (a - d) in this pastebin:
After doing all that, reboot.
Download the 12.11Beta from here:
Install everything.
You are done!
Note: Don't separately install the AMD APP SDK, it will be installed with the catalyst control center.
Best of luck and please report the outcome in this thread.

I also use it to introduce btc to friends that never heard of it, the reactions are priceless :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:02:45
You're kidding right?
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:40:19
With the 12.11Beta drivers please try:
Please also post the error message of GUIMINER crashing (View details)

Is it possible to publicly tip someone ? ( Tipping someone on his timeline, tipping in comments ?)
If not could it be possible to do this, this would be really huge and would indeed spread like wildfire as stated above.
Keep up the good work!

Bitstamp indeed! Free EU SEPA deposits within 1-3 working days.

Please tell us your hardware specs.
If you use a Radeon XXXX:
Are you using the newest catalyst drivers ? 13.1 ?
EDIT: My bad, I now see you use a Radeon. Which drivers do you have installed ? How much system RAM ?
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:23:12
I had exact this same error.
What I did was completely remove the AMD APP SDK including the catalyst drivers.
Then I installed the 12.11Beta drivers, this fixed it for me.

Thanks for your reply!
I also think Marktplaats will be used for the average seller, and indeed there's nothing to stop people from accepting bitcoins for their ads, but there is one big difference:
Bitcoin has a great potential for cool functionalities like instant ad promotion, escrow etc.
Besides that; all of bitcoins advantages will be a huge benefit for this types of platforms. 
Will fix your UI remark ASAP, will also add the current bitcoin euro price throughout the whole site.

Don't think so hard. Hiima is on the right track.
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:39:02
Could you please list the car on  that would be awesome! I launched this marketplace 2 days ago and a second car would be a nice addition to the ads!
Will be adding some bitcoin specific functionalities soon!
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:24:12
Try reinstalling guiminer 
Try running it in compatibility-modus.
Have you followed all of the steps a-d from the pastie? Searching for the related files could take a while.
EDIT: Could you also post the error (by clicking on "view details")
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:28:46
This looks very promising! Is this only for orders in dollars ? Or are you also processing orders in euros ? 
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:58:16
Looks like ruby on rails as backend with Twitter Bootstrap for the UI.
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:26:04
Great! I'll buy all you have for 70$ a coin!

Did you fully follow the instructions ?
* Use CCC to uninstall drivers.
* Reboot
* Uninstall all amd related drivers in the windows Control Panel
* Reboot
* Find for the files listed in the pastebin, delete all of them.
* Reboot
* Did you download 12.11 Beta or 12.11 ? Try 12.11 if you had beta drivers. Install them and select options advance (make sure everything is checked)
* Reboot
* Try GUIMINER again, else try CGMINER.
This should work, as i'm almost 100% positive that it's a driver issue.
