Ok, just noticed that Microwallet now have a tagline on their site describing themselves as a "Micropayment Cache". I actually quite like that, so I'll go with that for my site.
Thanks and for your suggestions!
Also, FWIW, I discovered another micropayment cache today: bitchest.me

Not sure "tip" would be the right word, since that would make people think of tip jars IMHO.
They are hot in the sense that they're online, bit they're not proper bitcoin wallets as they have no address. They're just a place to accumulate dust amounts of bitcoin until there's enough to transfer to a proper bitcoin wallet.
As far as I can tell, these services exist to overcome the minimum amount you can transfer over the bitcoin network (5430 satoshi IIRC). The individual payouts from the faucets tend to be below that minimum, so you need to gather several payouts before it exceeds that minimum and you actually receive your bitcoin.
I don't know how exactly they work behind the scenes but my guess would be that the faucets don't actually transfer satoshis to these services (let's call them "temp wallets" for now, but I think you can see why I'd like to find out what people call them or else establish a name for them :-P). Instead they probably just log the fact that some amount is owed to a certain bitcoin address. Once enough is owed to a temp wallet the faucet probably does a transfer. Likewise when the temp wallets have accumulated enough for a particular bitcoin address they make the transfer to them.

"Micro Transaction Wallet" could work. I might go with that for my site. Thanks!
As for their payout frequency, Coinbox apparently process them every 8 hours (so if you have accumulated &gt;= 5500 satoshi, you'll get your money then). Microwallet say they pay out immediately once you reach the threshold (5825 satoshi).
