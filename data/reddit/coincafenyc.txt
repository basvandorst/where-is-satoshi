I did it a while ago, so I can't remember for sure, but I believe I said the business was for the sale of cryptographic tokens on the internet. Since that sounds like an open loop business, I'm sure they flagged it as high risk and shut it down.

I wanted to clarify that you don't need to be in NYC physically to use the Coin Cafe service.
All of our options besides the In Person visit are available across the US and anywhere in the world.

Hi mistersinatra, right now I can only authorize small debit card transactions unless we know you in person. I sent an invitation code to James (below) for a debit card purchase up to $5. Of course you are welcome to transact larger amounts with our other purchase options (bank deposit, check, wire, in person), but at this time our risk with debit cards is just too high to open it up to everyone. Please PM me if you're interested in the debit card invitation for up to $5.
We can definitely send your coins to your coinbase wallet if you wish. Just put in your public key when you create the order.
Thanks kindly,

Hi, we haven't started selling on localbitcoins.com but perhaps that is a good avenue for us. We accept both checks (including money orders) and cash deposits. We've had several fraud and hacking attempts already, but our security is top-notch.
Thanks for your interest!

Hi, John from Coin Cafe here. We actually never got to use our Spark Pay account at all. They shut it down before we could use it even once.

Cheers, John

That's correct. We are limiting customer transactions to $2500 at the moment while we ramp up and test our scalability, not for legal compliance. Thanks for the link!

Hi Mel,
Thanks for stopping by the other day and braving the snow! It was great to meet you and thanks for your order. I look forward to chatting with you again. We're getting our Bank of America, Chase and Wells Fargo accounts up and running this week, so you'll be able to deposit at those locations as well in the future.
Thanks again!
