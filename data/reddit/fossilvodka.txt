So after 4 months the witch is found. And that wasn't the other chain. Congrats

BTC for holding, BCH for actual usage, that's clever
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:04:36
$10? Bitcoin not for the poor, you know
That's what one of the devs said
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:17:46
Ever heard about trading bots?
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:04:31
So what to use Bitcoin for if not for microtransactions? Doesnt it make it back a speculative asset only?
@_date: 2017-08-26 06:39:46
How about dark markets, the base of Bitcoin business back in time? Is it still good enough for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:05:44
No suggestion sorry. I use my own custom script for trading. Think Google can give some hits
Also check for HFT trading, you'll be delighted on this topic

Even dash has made more gains this year than BTC

It's a lesson learned not to underestimate the opponent or one might start bleeding

In Europe, gains are when selling for Fiat; that makes btc-usdt (tether coin) transactions taxless

All right if you want hardproof I have none. Thanks Bithoin for anonymity!
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:54:20
This was all clear since $900. All above was a nice sweet pump and everybody knew that it wouldn't keep the level. Face slap to the Core team that people would dump BTC fo a shit eh? Better start working on the backlog now
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:04:38
Because you say so or he just made you cry for a while?
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:31:51
Why Bitcoin not dollar then?
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:20:37
Ver still has 300k bitcoins in his sleeve
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:46:49
Now the ddos is unlawful, in opposite to any cryptopump in the world
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:38:52
Market will decide
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:54:59
So how do you expect it to rise at all? Guaranteed gains over time with no risk involved? Sounds heckin scammish
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:03:03
RemindMe! 1 month
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:19:53
I didn't want to go into details for each country separately just give a general impression.
btw. wasn't that half a year in Germany?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:02:42
Look, Bitcoin and stability are antonyms no matter what tearful argument you raise. We're all here for volatility, not Venezuela
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:59:38
This was only a demonstration of power. It was an obvious pump, not the real thing, everybody knew that. They achieved the goal at $1400 already, all the rest was a nice bonus. BTC is way behind with the queue now
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:15:59
You don't bring your life savings to the casino
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:05:22
2nd thought:
if mr Nakamoto were still with them, he could put a stop to our stuff pretty quickly...
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:43:31
Rumors here and there, his (allegedly) transfer on today morning for 25k BTC and so
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:39:27
De-legalize panic sells!
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:57:05
Buy more Bitcoin if you want it to rise
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:38:53
Hey op let me lend you some, on a small percent...
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:45:50
Dating or beating until you tell wallet keys?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:15:08
I think just enough to make him filthy rich in both Bitcoin and Cash on the same time.
