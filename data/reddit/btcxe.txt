seriously don't think it's a smear campaign, just a reflection of unmaterialised (and not unbased) hype. Bitcoin is here to stay, once the usage will hit critical mass the market will normalize once again

Thanks guys for your kind words. Remember that you can copy your current conversion to your clipboard and a) store it (allows to view conversion rate at certain points without interpreting a graph) or b) share it - conversion copied to clipboard, simply paste in feed, skype etc Once again thank you for your words, and feedback
