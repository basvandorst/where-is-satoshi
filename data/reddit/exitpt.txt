We use canvas to generate the cards, so everything is client-side. If you really want to check that, open your network tool on chrome/safari and see that not information about the card is being sent to the server.

It's on the roadmap. We are just starting for what is more mainstream. After all we want adoption.

Great job! When can we expect a macOS ready release ?

Since it's a testnet version I would be ok with that. I would love to a get iOS test wallet in order to test the LN projects I've been working on without the need to wait like 24h with the app opened :P
Great work with the app.

If you open direct channels with the service/merchant I don't see why one would need to wait for the 1000 channels.
Sitting at 17 nodes, 3 channels ( which happen to be the 3 channels I've opened)

Been Mapping for like 4 hours. Cannot really pay LN invoices for now. Is this a known issue ?
I do have already 3 open channels tho

bitcart.io has amazon gift cards with 10% discount.

You can use OpenNode’s quick invoice feature for this. If you withdraw every week through batching you can use the platform pratically for free. Bonus: it comes with Lightning Payments!
Take a look:  
If you have questions feel free to DM me.

Thanks for the feedback. Should be good!
Regarding using Lightning, you should use smaller amounts to test, you probably don't have enough channel capacity to pay such a big invoice.
Let me know if you have any more problems.

You will get 1% transaction fee if you reach a threshold of $1500 per month, which I doubt. The user experience and simplicity of the product are worth, try it out and decide for yourself.

- No. The quick invoice does not update the rate, most of the payments are done instantly (in-store payments). We can add a optional to 'automatically' update the rate, could be useful for 'freelancing' invoices. Thanks for the feedback.
- Could you please elaborate? Would love to get feedback.
- Automated scheduled withdrawals already exist. Currently once a week (subject to change depending on the volume), free of charge.
- No.

1st and 2nd points, got it. Thanks for the feedback, I'll pass to the team.
3rd - We provide free scheduled BTC withdrawals (weekly, we don't have enough volume to process daily yet). You can always withdraw your BTC whenever you please free of charge through LN.

I think there's no spread when you buy the cards. Plus they have some cool discounts. However, you might not get the code instantly, as opposed to Bitrefill

There is a channel between opennode and acinq -

Hello, João here. This is already implemented, you just need to click on the " Pay with Lightning" button and your wallet will open ;)

You can use the --sweepall flag.
e.g: `lncli sendcoins --addr=ADDR --sweepall --sat_per_byte=1`
@_date: 2018-12-01 02:30:38
The event is free.
