Domestic wires can be reversed in some circumstances. It's not common, but it is not impossible.

There is no reason for batch transactions to be even slightly slower than non-batch.  Coinbase will easily get enough other transactions to batch together with your withdrawal within a few seconds, and blocks are only once every 10 minutes.
If Coinbase implements Batching+segwit, it will both lower costs AND speed things up since the mempool likely will completely clear.

I see the same on my console.
Edited to add: Updating the Bitcoin app on the Nano S using Ledger Manager from 1.1.9 to 1.1.10 seems to have fixed the issue

Unfortunately though, even after upgrading to 1.1.10, I get this when I try and send from a Segwit wallet using Electrum 3.0:
error: {'message': 'the transaction was rejected by network rules.

64: non-mandatory-script-verify-flag (Signature must be zero for failed CHECK(MULTI)SIG 
Thankfully I only sent a small test amount into this segwit wallet.

Sure, but why not something that is memory hard and already proven in other cryptos ... Eg, Cryptonight for CPU/GPU and SHA256 for ASIC miners?

As I see it, the difference is that anyone can buy nVidia/AMD GPU, or Intel CPUs, and at roughly the same price. 
For the ASIC miners, the  manufacturer of ASIC miners is also one of the largest Bitcoin miner.

Having exactly the same problem with mine. Ledger Nano S, Electrum 3.0, Mac OSX High Sierra, 2017 Macbook Pro with USB-C -&gt; USB-A adapter.
If I try making a new wallet with m/44'/0'/0', it works just fine to show my non-segwit balance.

IMHO, if we were to consider PoW change, it would be best to support multiple PoW's at the same time, and have difficulty apply individually to each PoW to allow for both sides to contribute, and have a more frequent retargeting interval.

Ledger Nano S.
