Fwiw, locksmith/somewhat experienced safe tech here. I also want to note that, although the point is moot in this case because of the immersion, a fire safe uses crystalized water in it's filler material to disperse moisture into the safe cabin as it gets heated by a house fire to keep contents from combusting. If you're going to keep papers (like seed keys, titles, etc) in a fire safe it's best to seal them in a heavy waterproof bag/file. And for data storage devices, you should use a data safe (some people use a small data safe inside a fire safe, which I would recommend) as OP was super lucky imo that the stick wasn't corrupted/damaged too badly.

I don't have any advanced understanding of any of this, but I understand it like this: Firstly it pertains to the US and any other income taxing government that follow the Western calendar year. If at any point during this year someone may have sold some Bitcoin for cash, that action generated taxable income. So people in this situation may want to sell for cash before the end of the year to cover the tax they owe on this year's earnings.

So true. There are entire sectors of a new blockchain model of operations that are only in the conceptual phases of existence yet. As things get flushed out, the FUD will wane, I believe.

I have some in my IRA (~10%) with Bitcoin Investment Trust. It's a security on the Chicago mercantile exchange. Each share is worth some tiny fraction of a Bitcoin plus a management premium ($14/share ATM).

As someone who dropped a few Benji's because a random "block chain" company looked pretteh kew in early December, I can confirm all of these things. Don't trade in anything other than peak mental condition.

Yeah I'd call this one long slide. We can be sure there's a floor at zero at least.
