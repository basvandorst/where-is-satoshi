P2pool more than tripled in the last few hours (approaching four times its size from a day ago).  One of the pool node operators said they are testing new miners today and the rest comes online for good on Monday. 
Doesnt account for the block increase though since majority of the new blocks are coming from the usual big pools.

You're missing the point.  The question isn't around profits for the miners, but in securing the network, the Blockchain, and the Bitcoin economy overall by protecting against exploits and the 51% attack issues that have been a concern lately.  If the network's transactions aren't being efficiently and quickly confirmed by distributed mining, there will essentially be zero worth in Bitcoin.  The more secure and quickly the transactions are confirmed by miners (current model or as suggested above with commoditized ASICs in everything), the more people/merchants/services will adopt Bitcoin and the price will go up.

Great idea! Though donations were possible through p2pool, putting a better face on it is a great idea!
Do you mind if I link to your donation site from my node?  I already mentioned it on BitcoinTalk. 
Hmmm. The odd thing was that 3 donations went out and I was only part of one of them.  
My miner/node seemed to only be a part of the first donation test. 
How does p2pool distribute donations?  Does the code randomly choose a set number based on amount of donation to minimize dust?  I would think it would be better to hold in the chain until a certain threshold and then pay out to everyone who has active shares. Anyone know?

It's the same expected returns over an infinite amount of time comparison.  But the limited active share timeframe of up to 3 days is a variable that introduces a thresh-hold which makes the probability of remaining eligible for block payout Un-tenable at lower Hashrates.  Essentially you're throwing the dice like in solo mining at that point.  Threshold was around 10GH a little while ago, these days I'd say it's closer to 100GH. Regular pool PPLNS makes more sense for low hashrate miners due to this variable.

Not exactly... More luck and more chance for payouts from finding blocks  so variance of payout would lower.  It's accepted share per miner hashrate with adjusted estimated payout per blocks that would be affected, but payouts would still happen more often than the current 3 days or so on bad streaks.

You're correct fundamentally, but...
The issue is with lower Hashrates and the max 3 day active share limit, and the current 3-4 days between blocks (actual, not the estimated 19 hours or so p2pool shows, due to continuing horrible luck), and difficulty rising like crazy every few days, for someone who's only estimated to find a share every 7 days, the 1 in a 1000 crapshoot vs 1 in a million crapshoot of solo mining makes little difference.  Especially if they only realistically can continue mining for only 3 more months (and that's being generous/conservative) before they lose more in electricity costs. 
For those who have too high estimated time to find a share, it makes more sense to collect the pennies for the three months they have left of mining on a centralized pool than hoping to get a dollar on chance. 
That said, things are still ok for those of us who have grown our farms over a TH and will continue to grow them with p2pool.  If only the estimated time to find a block matched the hard cold reality we're seeing now. :(

Failure of Central Banking (like what happened with Cyprus) would encourage a run on Bitcoin.  Bitcoin prices skyrocketed when Cyprus and then Iceland had Central Bank issues.  It's very relevant to the Bitcoin economy.
From the article: 


This is a common refrain among Bitcoin (and Gold) Boosters as the reason why these debt based currencies will eventually fail and that Bitcoin (or Gold) would potentially be a refuge.
Arguably, events such as this will ultimately have more long term affect on the success of Bitcoin than a local Bitcoin ATM, some new online merchant accepting bitcoin, or some other mention in the mainstream media.

Earmarking future debt without specifying the source of the funds that future generations will have to deal with is what government does these days.  The loss of the Gold Standard may have set that behavior in motion, but it does not prevent them from writing as many IOUs as they want.  Yes, they do it in the form of printing more money these days, but there are other methods like generating more bonds and vague promises of future tax growth from economic incentive programs to drive the debt further into the hole. Essentially when money is involved, no matter the form it takes or if they have control of it or not, the Gov will find a way.

Why aren't more miners using decentralized P2Pool nodes (personal nodes or public nodes) instead of the seemingly more popular GHash.io, BTCGuild and Eligius (the top three pools for BTC)? P2Pool seems more aligned with the ethos behind Bitcoin and despite high variance, it has a great potential for higher payouts over time for the miners.

Nope, still decentralized.  Each node is just a cog in the wheel of the shared network pool so there is no single point of failure.  In fact, if you join one public p2pool node or use your own locally, it's a good idea to have others as your backup pools just in case your primary pool node becomes unavailable (for maintenance, updates or DDOS). Your work (shares submitted) carry over to all p2pool nodes and you can freely jump around to the closest/fastest/most efficient node to your location without worry and still get paid. 
There's only two big caveats for p2pool I see.  Due to P2pool's relatively low usage and hashrate vs all the centralized pools on the Bitcoin network, variance and luck have a bigger impact on when blocks are found and you get paid. There has been an uptick in hashpower joining recently (from around 200TH to close to 400-500TH in a week's time), but we still need a lot more to compete with the likes of GHash.io and BTCGuild for blocks. 
Secondly, due to the variance and active time of shares (up to 3 days usually, you may want to google the p2pool wiki for more info), only users of a certain Hashrate and above should bother with p2pool.  The less hashrate you have, the harder it is to remain eligible to receive payouts upon blocks found and the greater your variance.  The guidelines used to be around 10GH and up a few months/weeks ago, but lately I'd venture it's not worth it for those below 100GH. That said, I've seen people join with only a lowly single 355MH Block erupter. At that point it becomes a crap shoot only a little better than solo mining. A regular pool at low hashrate guarantees a smaller but regular payout at that hashrate.

In a sense, kinda sorta.  The current model works fine if we could get p2pool beyond a certain threshold of hashpower/percentage of the Bitcoin network, resulting in lower variance, increased profits for miners, reduced incentive to join pools like GHash.io, and happy happy people. 
But we're currently stuck in a chicken and egg situation.  Large scale mining farms with some exceptions don't want to leave GHash.io because of the steady payouts (low variance) to join a high variance decentralized p2pool network. 
Where the OP's suggestion could come into play is if there were a large scale commoditized ASIC push installed in everyday electronics that was locked to p2pool nodes, this could turn that tide. 
Of course we could accomplish the same thing with sizeable farms turning to p2pool already despite the short term high variance and maybe even a few of the larger centralized pools switching to p2pool backends.  Probably a pipe dream though in both cases. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 12:27:44
Fair enough.  Not trying to belittle your good work. Just i'd rather see people touting "Fiftieth Bitcoin establishment in ____ accepting Bitcoin" than so many "First" announcements. The more we keep seeing first this and first that, the more people will think Bitcoin is too young and no one will join in.  At this stage, we're better off getting more establishments to actually join than touting a first, that way we can instead claim whole groups of stores accepting Bitcoin (like all those Bitcoin avenue announcements). Doing it this way (announcing "firsts") could work against us.

Even without bringing Bitcoin into the use case, using both property based and foreign currency based tax rules, you'd technically have to report the income, but depending on which rules are in play, you'd pay (or not) differently. 
So if you traded someone on the side (not through an exchange) something like 1000 euros for dollars, you'd have to file that.  
Similarly if you bought shares in a company (or traded for something), you'd have to file that too.  
Each method of accounting for tax has their own benefits and detriments.  Long term investors would probably make out better with Property based taxation while Foreign Currency taxation would be better for day to day transactions and Miners. 
But having to not file or pay anything at all is not really a Bitcoin thing, it's more of a tax evasion, money laundering, or anti-gov thing and can be accomplished with cash much easier than with Bitcoin with it's full ledger.
That said, in the situation you outlined, if you didn't convert to fiat, foreign currency rules would probably work better for you.

So, Bitcoin Classic is going to go a different route, and apparently one that is rapidly gaining widespread economic and majority mining pool consensus.  c'est la vie. 
What you propose is fine, if discussion is allowed.  It was not.
You can't skip discussion and proposals if you're being banned with all comments and threads deleted or re-sorted to "controversial".  So discussion wasn't skipped.  It was gagged.

Definitely a difference of opinion on that.  True that we dont want to be inundated with spam and propaganda from either side of the discussion or from outside topics, but moderation should carefully toe the line of neutral involvement in debates. When there is a known history and very definite bias in moderation (Bitcoin XT is hardly the first controversial topic to get this treatment here), this ceases to be a forum and becomes a political mouthpiece instead.  I'd rather read both sides of the argument for Bitcoin's future here. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:51:47
No, no its not.  Same blockchain, same core original devs, not even close to an alt-coin.  This isnt Litecoin or Dogecoin.  This is Bitcoin's future.

So, wait until the train hits us before we get off the tracks? Yup, that makes sense. /s
Alternative proposal, let's get off the tracks on a regular schedule before the trains get near us. The network will never be able to handle mainstream levels of transactions otherwise.

I tried multiple times, without insults, to respond and make my thoughts known.  You responded with insults and utterly baffling (at least to me) interpretations of what I said (and didn't say) in ways that left me dumbfounded.  I seriously don't know what else to say. I can't have a discussion with someone banging on the wall saying that I'm an idiot for saying things I didn't say.  You can't argue when you're not having the same conversation or on the same planet.
**Edit:** looking back at the thread to see where the total misunderstanding comes from, i realize now that you do not understand what != is. This means Not Equals. Its a common operand used in programming and I guess its common use in both jargon and business/technology circles may not extend to everyone here.  Please read the original thread as intended with the words "does not equal" in its place. It may make more sense to you then. Thanks.

That's the beauty of the system.  If most people don't agree with the feature/fork, it won't become part of network.  Working as it should be.
Only problem here was lots of political and verbal contention and overzealous moderation.
@_date: 2015-08-17 08:51:03
Its a different Bitcoin Client on the same network and chain with an added featureset. Just like other clients like BitcoinJ, etc. and just like those trying to add Lightning, Side-Chains, Colored Coins and other none current core features that "could" be future features on the Bitcoin chain if critical mass is achieved.  If no consensus, then Bitcoin doesnt get those features.  In fact, every Bitcoin-core version upgrade is its own branch created from forks of bitcoin-core in github especially those proposing BIP's (BIP101 in this case). No biggie, same ole same ole. So no, a fork of a Bitcoin Client is not a different coin. Especially since the client in question will probably go away if it doesnt get critical mass by January next year. So if as you say the current version of Bitcoin continues, this client won't stick around. 
So i should amend what I said above with it being one of many potential "Futures" for Bitcoin.  But like in Highlander, there can be only one. Over time we'll find out which.   
Altcoins by their very definition (Alternative Coin to Bitcoin) must be a separate and parallel existing coin to Bitcoin even if it was originating with Bitcoin-core's codebase (i.e. Litecoin or Namecoin). They dont propose to be future iterations of Bitcoin, only alternatives and have their own alternate blockchain.  So this client in question, is again, not an altcoin since the goal is to become a future path of Bitcoin not be a new coin parallel to it.

Your reading comprehension is truly baffling.  Maybe if you read the whole thread outloud it would help. It's like I'm saying the white house is white and you're saying I'm claiming "The whitehouse is going to blow up". Sorry if we're not understanding each other, but your interpretation of what I'm saying is so off that there's no way to explain it further.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:03:47
Ok, can the analogies.
To grow, its better to methodically plan out and implement a mining/node consensus to increase capacity for transaction volume in a reasonable way prior to the forseen transactions from proposed new mainstream market players and fast-trading NYSE and NASDAQ backed trading exchanges coming online early next year.  This has now been done with BitcoinXT which even with consensus doesnt have us including 8MB blocks until January, but a controlling minority of forum moderators and Bitcoin developers who oppose Mike Hearn and Gavin's plans are censoring and undermining Satoshi's original path and want to wait until transactions are deadlocked before executing an alternate, un-layed out, and non-defined switch to larger blocks. So how long will bitcoin survive if the largest new exchanges are stopped and users can't purchase products using bitcoin due to transaction slowdowns/blockages? If we have a plan now that was developed over the last few months in a methodical way, why not implement it now when it can be done before things explode into the mainstream (i.e. Exponential node expansion after the next Bitcoin mainstream surge)?  Thats what this whole argument is about. Simply, follow a plan or wait until it all breaks.

The beauty of the network is that they're welcome to try.  If they don't get consensus for their blocks from all nodes that pass the transactions, it will be all for naught.  Bitcoin remains bitcoin either way. So not silly at all... very binary actually.  Litecoin, Dogecoin and the like are all on parallel blockchains and aren't attempting to directly usurp bitcoin's chain.  They are Altcoins.
BitcoinXT is an alternative client on the same blockchain and network as Bitcoin-core (like bitcoinj and other alternative clients on the Bitcoin network).  If BitcoinXT supporters achieve consensus by taking 75% of the network's blocks, then it is still the Bitcoin network with different newer features.  If not, it's the old legacy Bitcoin network without those features.  Either way it's still the same Bitcoin blockchain.  If that sounds silly to you, don't know what else to say.
It's the difference between trying to make a different parallel network to the Internet not directly tied to the original versus using a different Browser client (Chrome, Edge/IE, Firefox, Safari, etc. ) to influence CSS and javascript standards on the existing web.  Just because I use Chrome and want people to eventually incorporate CSS standards initiated in Chrome into the global standards doesn't mean I want to create a totally separate Internet or web protocol, just evolve the existing Web.  That's the difference here.  Altcoins are alternatives to Bitcoin.  BitcoinXT is a possible and entirely user/mining/node voteable evolution of direction for the current Bitcoin network.  There's a huge gulf of difference between what BitcoinXT means versus Altcoins.

@_date: 2015-08-16 22:29:03
How's this...maybe it will be more clear:
BitcoinXT isnt an Altcoin. 
Altcoins don't need consensus WITH BITCOIN.  
That said, I NEVER SAID ALTCOINS need or don't need consensus with ANYTHING.  Don't know if you're conflating my comments with the voices in your head, but there it is.  The only context I EVER used the word "consensus" is with the BitcoinXT alternate Bitcoin client as it applies to the Bitcoin Blockchain, not with any Altcoins at all.  
Seriously it's like I'm arguing with you about numbers and you keep yelling in my face "ORANGE!!!"  Lost cause I guess.
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:20:45
Easy... different blockchain and network = altcoin.
Same blockchain and network working towards concensus with one of many alternative clients != altcoin.  Very simple line to draw outside of politics, emotion, or motivations.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:31:13
Don't quite think you're reading what you think you're reading in my comment.  


OF course not, because BitcoinXT isn't an altcoin.  That's the point.


I probably bungled the wording here a bit, but I meant if more than 75% of the blocks were being passed were from BitcoinXT nodes, than consensus achieved, if not, oh well, same ole same ole.  


I agree with that.  But a fork (soft or hard) doesn't make it an Altcoin which is a parallel and totally separate cryptocurrency/network.  Successful or not, an attempt to fork the bitcoin network does NOT make it an Altcoin.  If BitcoinXT succeeds... it's still the bitcoin network with the proposed new features.  If it fails, BitcoinXT dies and the legacy network remains.  IT's all still the same single contiguous bitcoin network.  Valid chains continue and the invalid chain goes off to die.  Altcoins run in parallel and don't affect originating copy.

Yes, but the idea of mass producing these discounts are to get people to the stores in the first place.  In this case, the customers are already heading into the store before they get waylaid by someone selling discounts, so they are already factored in and are not the real target of Starbuck's gift card campaigns. It's an example of "Preaching to the Choir".

It's called a soft launch.  Happens all the time in web development, the code goes out there and can be A/B Tested against a percentage of the population or even closed beta testers in the production environment.  Then they can ramp up slowly until they're ready to open the flood gates.

Just like Blockchain.info the company takes its name from the concept of the Bitcoin [blockchain]( Coinbase the company takes its name from the concept of the Bitcoin [coinbase]( "the contents of the 'input' of a generation transaction".  Basically the input of transactions typically have their parent output information, but if you go back far enough to the initial generation of the coin, it's original generation transaction (when it was mined) has no parent and the 'input' is the "coinbase".
So the statement at 17:24 is correct using the original meaning of the term coinbase.

Have you undervolted your 7950's any?  You should be able to handle at least 5 comfortably if you used the 0.967v bios on them, especially if they're MSI Twin Frozr III's which can run full tilt even undervolted.
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:57:40
I agree with the general sentiment, but you may need to balance that with evidence in hand.  Most of the Coinbase complaints I've read and written have been after at least two or three support emails go unanswered. My own complaint wasn't posted to reddit until 2 days after the promised completion date of a sale and after I had 3 support emails without a non-automated response and even then, it was not an individual post, but a comment on some other threads. 
The problem is a known one, that customer support does not seem forthcoming without a Reddit post which Fred or someone else from Coinbase takes time to answer. You wouldn't see so many Coinbase posts if they didn't resolve issues seemingly via reddit more than their own email forms. If they break that cycle, bam, no more reddit posts. 
Now don't get me wrong, I love Coinbase and it's early days yet.  Unfortunately with BitInstant MIA, they're the only USA based game in town for purely online transactions. Competition would do everyone good and we need more start ups like them. 
Again, I agree with the sentiment, but when there is no more recourse, and we have exhausted other means of communication, then we go with what works. As far as I've seen, this is what makes up the majority of Coinbase complaints here and the 1-5 list you made is the exception, not the rule.

The 0.962v ones I use are from a set that are for two different Sapphire Vapor-X models and two variations of the MSI TFIII 7950s.
I do see a bunch of Sapphire 7950 bioses that some people have tried to flash on Sapphire 100352-4L with various levels of success (quick search of the Litecoin Mining Forum).  Most bios links are coming from TechPowerUp so you may want to search there.
