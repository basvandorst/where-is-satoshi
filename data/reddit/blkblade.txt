Because I'd like to diverisfy my investments. I'm a bit crypto heavy right now thanks to the rise. For example, I think the Marijuana sector may perform well over the next decade as it becomes legalized (as long as Trump doesn't screw it up). Look at the CANN stock pattern starting from 2016 - looks awfully similar to the BTC bubble pattern (a few weed stocks have done this). But the only available money I have to do that right now is locked up in BTC.

I am a little bit confused by the article. How is selling Bitcoin through LocalBitcoin, any different than using a service like Coinbase? What exactly did he do here that isn't legal? Not report his transactions? Or make money off the transactions via commission (thus operate as an "person exchange").

I thought of that too. My value in BTC peaked in 2014 - but then I made some stupid trades, panic sold (what would now be considered large amounts) in the $300 range. Over the years I built it back up and have exceeded what I had then. If I could point to my wallet and say "look, in 2014 when BTC was $500 - I had X BTC in my wallet, so I will claim long term gains on that X BTC" - that would be fantastic.

While this makes sense, unfortunately the hardware costs and electricity costs would only make up a small fraction of my total BTC stash.

This is what I am here trying to figure out - the best honest effort to minimize tax hit. :)

Would I be able to take Roth balances and invest them in Bitcoin for tax free growth?

Between losing 16 BTC on BTC-e, and forgetting the password of another wallet I created a month ago with 10 BTC in it, it's been a really shitty month for me. Law of averages I guess... this year was turning out to be too good for me. Still is, so I can't complain too hard.

If this passes, does this mean I will have massively overpaid in 2017 and either be due a refund or just apply my refund to future tax years? I traded BTC for LTC in March, and something like 5x'd my BTC stack, before selling it on Coinbase. Same goes BTC I traded for DOGE later that year and 3x'd that stack of BTC. I treated most of that as ST gains since like-kind wasn't assured...

They're being confirmed because less people are transacting with Bitcoin right now. The backlog has dropped significantly. Take it for what it's worth [Bitinfocharts]( but the last month has seen a decrease in transactions, while other blockchains have increased.
