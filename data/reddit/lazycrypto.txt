That's what I said about [tensorcharts.com]( the first time I saw it.

Assuming 4 per box, you got 5 rows of 5 stacked two high, that's 50 boxes. I'm counting 200 at least. Assuming the   other 6-7 bigger boxes are PSUs. Nice set up.

So your argument is, "they can just take their seed and import it into a 'legit' bitcoin wallet and recover their BTC?" lol, kinda makes the app worthless don't it?

I guess he could have put his check account and routing number up there. But then he'd have to worry about people draining his bank account. luckily he doesn't have to worry about that with accepting BTC. You know this, so the question now becomes, why are YOU playing dumb?

Scared money goes to the mattress first. It might find its way into crypto eventually, but not before a warm glass of milk and a bed time story.

The adjustment is every 2016 blocks, not every two weeks. If you take 2016 block times 10mins average per block, that comes out to 2 weeks. But the "2 weeks" isn't the actual block adjustment period. It's based on block count. And you ask why is seqwit under 50% adoption, that is because the last time I checked, people have free will. No one is forcing anyone to use a seqwit address. And there was no "hard fork to divide the community." Bitcoin adopted seqwit and a very very VERY small subset of the community disagreed and decided to fork the chain and do their own thing.

A $500 purchase is a $500 purchase. On my statement there's not extra charge for the "transaction and hardware costs of a conventional banking system." I'll double check, but i'm sure it's not on there. That cost in on the back end, the banks problem. Not mine, the end consumer. Your average joe doesn't care how things happen, they only see that this credit card over here give them cash back, and this one over here gives them more airline miles. 
MetalPay may disrupt that. (I've got no clue) but what I can tell you is MetalPay doesn't exist yet and credit cards do, and they are already giving people cash back. That's reality.

Coinme is good. 10% fee tho. If you go to the one in Vancouver it's only 5%.
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:47:57
While I love BTC, it still doesn't offer me 1% cash back on all my purchases. Just being real. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:54:10
lol, calm down bro.
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:45:21
Yeah, credit cards are pretty simple. It's basic math. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:56:38
you mean $10,000 right? not 10.000 (i.e. $10)

If you have the ability to go to a technical school and learn a design program like Revit or AutoCAD. that would help you in your job search. Those jobs are in VERY high demand. Usually starting around $24 per hour. 
Now I'm not suggesting you do this, but if the buddy you're taking care of wants to pay you back for your help, ask him to co-sign your student loans. he may not have any money or credit to his name, but having two people as the responsibility party will help get you the loan. 
As for investing. You already have some BTC, so don't sell it. Buy some more. dollar cost average your way in. every month, buy $20 in BTC and start accumulating it over time. I would stay away from stocks. The market is looking like it's gonna start pulling back soon and you don't want to be the guy who buys at the top.

Pennsylvania prohibits taking photos in a polling station. While it's not illegal to take a "ballot selfie," you are required to leave the premise before doing so. He clearly took a picture of the voting machine from within the booth, thus he broke the law. Took me 2 minutes on google to find this out. You are lazy.

So the Bakkt announcement MONTHS ago said that Starbucks will be it's first major business to use their platform. Where have you been all this time? They literally said MONTHS ago, Starbucks would be accepting crypto by the end of the year.

I'm sure as an "entrepreneur," the money doesn't play any part....

Typical triggered SJW.... play the card your most comfortable with right?

If he made you the account, then he probably took the coins back. Are you sure you still have them? Sounds to me like he took advantage of you.

This is 2018, not 1998, you can't get an ice cream cone for less than $6 from one of those trucks.
FYI, the fees are only "expensive" because 1 Satoshi is worth more than the dignity of the entire Btrash community.

Just tweet at Trump. Tell him that Hilary would have never pardoned him either.

LMAO, Can't understand 1 sat per byte cost? Got it.

OP is just trolling... he's just a worthless piece of Btrash.
