Maybe it's actually found its price equilibrium

And at least if something like Exxon or General Mills or JPMorgan enters a bear period, you can say "Well people probably aren't about to stop using oil or eating cereal or banking."  They're proven already -- nothing is guaranteed but they're probably not going anywhere.  Bitcoin is not proven at this point, it's mostly still theoretical as far as any widespread use as a currency beyond the black market.  That's what HODLers miss -- we are nowhere near inevitability at this point, no matter how clever the arguments are.  It's no different than that revolutionary cancer treatment you just read about on the main page (but hasn't completed Phase II trials yet).

Right.  Bitcoin is at best the equivalent of a highly speculative stock.  It's like calling a "bear market" in a pharma stock that doesn't have a single FDA-approved drug yet.

Sure it took years for email and the internet to reach widespread adoption.  And until it did, IT WAS SPECULATIVE.  You know what’s so crazy is that there are also other technologies that never did reach widespread adoption.  And no one knew for certain which would and wouldn’t get that level of penetration.  That’s what makes them speculative.  
Lol @ “depends which landlord.”  Is it one out of a hundred? One out of a thousand?  The funny thing is that there’s zero evidence that it’s “more and more” every day.  In fact plenty of businesses that used to accept bitcoin have dropped it since.

Omg you true believers are all the same.  Can
I pay my taxes in it? Can I pay my utility bill in it? Rent? Phone bill? Groceries in the vast majority of stores? Can I use it on amazon? Target? Walmart? Can I buy health insurance with it? Will my local corner store take it? 7/11? Walgreens? Any major clothing retailer? Sporting goods stores? Bookstores?
Oh wait but there are a handful of cafes and ATMs, and don’t forget overstock.com which is hurtling toward bankruptcy. “Multiple websites” holy shit and it’s only been around for ten years.  Clearly this is widely used technology/currency and not speculative at all.  Do you people even hear what you sound like?

Except the opposite happened last year -- bitcoin prices rose dramatically November - December

Well yeah, because getting in at 3-4k is only any good BEFORE it blows up to 19k.  Not after.  HTH.

So...you're saying investor sentiment was positive at that time because of factors affecting the market for Bitcoin.  Whereas at this time, investor sentiment has not really turned negative, Bitcoin has just been falling steadily and precipitously for a year straight because people need to buy christmas presents.
