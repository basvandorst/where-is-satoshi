so i will avoid mtgox
i noticed that bitcoins on btc e are cheaper than on bitstamps what if i buy them on btc e than sell them on bitstamp to make a profit, will it work ?

so if i buy some on btc e or bitstamp it's not safe to store them there ?

hi thank you for the response, this is money that i can afford to loose 
i have missed my chance when bitcoin was at 50, 100 , 300, 400 and know it is at 800
i don't want to miss the boat anymore
