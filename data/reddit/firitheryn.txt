@_date: 2017-12-07 18:26:05
Everybody 'member when it was a wild speculation that it would hit 10k by the end of this year?

I use gyft.com They have amazon gift cards so there is that.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:04:30
widely visited and trusted online trading companies. Ebay, Amazon. those types

Tell me about it. They are gonna rob me of my order. I put it in a week ago and it is supposed to come out today.... I will not be using them again.

Yeah. I saw an image today of the ongoing testing. They have a working ASIC model now... it's just not quite up to spec. I honestly don't care lol. I just want to get it sooner than later.

If only. I recognize this doesn't help you with your current venture but it is what bit coin needs, wide availability. You could start an eBay style bidding page. Use this sub as a launching platform. And the basic miner forums

I used Bitinstant this morning and had the bitcoins before I got home.

Same exact position. I decided I could part with the $150 on the BFL but I doubt it will ever come. I am waiting for the middle/end of the week so see what the price does, then I will invest a bit.

I think there is something strange going on. I've been waiting a bit for my bitinstant as well.

It does feel hard for the cautious investor with very little expendable money (spelled school loans) to buy in, in what feels like a meaningful manner. I'm afraid of missing the early adoption curve but feel that some of the methods to buy in more significantly are to high risk. 
Edit: changed by to buy

Yeah, Thanks. I feel like that's what I did when I pre-ordered the Jalapeno.... we will see how that goes, lol
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:13:11
Yeah I read that as. You will take what we give you and like it. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:37:16
Same exact situation. Freaking ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:59:00
Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:21:52
Thanks. I certainly try.
