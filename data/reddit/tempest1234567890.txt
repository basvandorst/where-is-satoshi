Uhm thats confusing because last week when I researched a bit what to do on the b2x fork people on and youtube said that there will be no free coins this time because this fork is different from the others. Did I misunderstand something or is this a coinbase-only thing?

Oh damn, you´re absolutely right, I am at work and in a hurry, didn´t see this part. I´m sorry!

If, if, if
The thing is you did the right thing for you in the situation you have been years ago.
I had my first look at bitcoin years back when it was around 80$ and too am kicking myself for not buying then.
BUT it´s still "just" money. You would have also felt like shit when you hadn´t sold your bitcoin - there also was a possibility that it may have dropped below 10 bucks. That way you maybe hadn´t even been able to pay your rent at all. What I am trying to say is: Don´t look back - you did what was right for you back then and that is all that matters.

Thank you sir!

I´m confused...will this increase oder decrease the bitcoin price?
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:39:06
Can somebody ELI5 how a difficulty is set? I mean I know what it is used for and what it means but how is the difficulty determined (haha "mined" get that)?

I´ve been strong for weeks now but it´s so hard to do when you see the lines going up and up and up :D I´m kicking myself for not buying when I first heard of buitcoin when it was ~200$ because I thougt it won´t go much higher. Won´t do the same mistake two times
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:41:41
This pretty much sums up the last few weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:45:05
Thats pretty accurate most marriages
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:14:43
Wait, what, how do you do this?
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:31:14
I´ll look into it, thank you very much.
Damnit I told myself to never leave coins on an exchange...
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:10:34
They are saying that this is on purpose because this will lower the deifficulty for BCH and raise the difficulty for BTC which will pull miners on the BCH side.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:41:27
I am with you bro
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:10:01
Actually thats not a bad explanation at all :) Thank you very much.

It´s not there
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:12:48
wtf :D
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:38:12
holy fuck, gj mate :D
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:37:53
what do you mean exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:29:12
somewhere between 1$ and 100000000$
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:00:44
And you spend both of them unrelated to each other? For example if I hold 1 BTC at the time of the fork: BTC is 7000$ at this point and B2X at (whatever) 3000$. That means if I cash out I will get ~10000usd?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:12:11
Yeah, that´s one huge ugly fake brick wall
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:46:34
Holy cow, source?
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:20:02
Thats exactly what I need, thank you sir!
