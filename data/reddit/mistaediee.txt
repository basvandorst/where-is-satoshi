How do you convince those individual actors to make less money than the others who stay?
@_date: 2014-11-18 00:58:29
Thank you! This needs to be at the top. Everyone thinks the US Gov't stole these coins without due process and this shows otherwise.

How do you convince them to move first? They may be losing money for months or years as the other pool comes up.

Not if they sell immediately as they mine. Then they're just laughing at you for thinking they would be benevolent to the community. They mime to make a profit.

I'm just disappointed that it wasn't an ad for bitcoin. Other payment processors are fighting back, guys.

He's taking a hard line approach against Bitcoin because it is a natural competitor to his business. I would do the same in his position. Bitcoin is a threat to Euro Pacific. He's making all these arguments because Euro Pacific's board is shaking in their boots.

Depends on where you are divorcing. In some states in the U.S., any money earned during marriage is community property, which is owned 50/50 by each spouse, regardless of fault in a divorce,. Doesn't matter who earned it. For long-term marriages, the rebuttable presumption is the entire marital estate is community property.

Are you pending verification?

1.5 BTC cancelled two days ago for me. (The transaction was from the 7th of November, when the price was at $294.99.) Was flagged as high risk. I was pending level 2 verification and had provided all bank and credit card information. I'm using BofA btw. I'm still waiting for a resolution on this. Hope they come through...
EDIT: Just go an email from customer service. Transaction is back to pending at the original price! Hope it goes through this time!

Thanks for your educated and reasoned opinion.

I don't think they have enough staff, lol. They take weeks to respond to emails and I think they use templates.

I haven't sold any coins yet. How long does it take for an on-time withdrawal?

Arbitration is a private dispute resolution. Whether the arbitrator is biased depends on what private arbitrator you end up with. What did they do? I had a cancelled transaction last week, took them about a week and a half, but they eventually honored it.

Maybe it got blocked on the bank side for being such a large amount? I'd try contacting your bank to see if there is a limit on your account.

has over 68,000 readers and is growing by the moment I don't think he's doing it on purpose... Anyways arbitration has costs too, and the clause probably includes some kind of attorney fee agreement so I would do a little bit of investigation before filing a claim.

I don't know why people are downvoting you. I'd like to know if some people aren't having their original transactions honored, even after resolving things with customer service. That is not how I want a fiduciary to act. It would not be acceptable with my broker, that's for sure.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:28:01
Wow. ACH out of your account went through?
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:42:52
Atheist pendants for bitcoin. You really know how to market to the Reddit crowd!
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:45:41
I'm thinking about closing mine too. i don't want to jump to conclusions, but having my order cancelled when the market went up 35% is awfully suspicious...

There are way too many unknowns in your valuation. Seems like you just picked out numbers which sound reasonable to you, but you have offered no reason as to why you chose those numbers. 1%, by the way, would be a huge amount of value. [Citibank only has USD 1.86 trillion in assets at the close of 2013.]( Do you think BTC will exceed such an established financial institution?
