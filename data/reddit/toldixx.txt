True, but think also about the practicality. Why would an individual choose to use a bank account to purchase bitcoins, wait three business days to receive them (paying premium), then use the bitcoins to purchase goods (also paying a premium), when an individual could choose to just punch in a credit card or pay by paypal and have the money automatically deducted from their bank account?

I have my doubts as well... Currently my entire life savings are in bitcoin (I am 22).

Well GoDaddy has it at $4,636. Guess it isn't too steep.
Anyways... Out of my budget. Thanks for the advice
