Wow that's Satoshi for sure

It's pretty much a very very profitable idea with absolutely 0 competition. 
I think the problem with that is that is :
-you are very very vurnable to fraud as credit card payment is reversible and Bitcoin is not.
-that defeat the purpose of Bitcoin,  why not pay directly with cc instead of using Bitcoin  as MM . (That's how I see it atleast)
That for me and most of peoples is a deal breaker and heart breaking for average joe.
But and that's a big but , if you my friend can solve this you will simply became a millionaire and that's a sure thing. 
Just remember that bitcoin fraud is a big thing now ..just browse this subreddit and you will know what I'm talking about... This is risky ...stay safe.

Ah Satoshi would never do that , He created bitcoin goddamnit .. he is the father of bitcoin. No father sells his child. You just don't get it . Bitcoin is more than just money it's FUTURE. And as far as I know , future is priceless.

I contacted them but they don't seem to bother replying!
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:34:23
Yes and for that I'm really grateful. It's something so pure so simple and yet so complicated and well engineered.  I think this the most perfect think we ever created. So perfect that in heaven you will find Bitcoin accepted here sign.

I'm SN but I forgot every private key or smth that can prove I'm SN , if I wasn't SN would I say that I'm SN!?

He is a professional con man, don't fall for his manipulative emotional writing.
He couldn't provide proof, so best option for him is to make himself the victim. Now he can see: 'I have the proof but I am not going to show it to you because you are so mean'.
This man is pathetic.
