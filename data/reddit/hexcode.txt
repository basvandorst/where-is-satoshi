So an address with an output exposes its public key?
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:45:32
Aren't addresses the public key? So not just reused, but used at all?
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:32:02
I stand corrected. I initially saw only overstock's response
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:02:12
Ahhh. Because they are display formats? Their underlying value are bytes? Like numbers can be formatted as currency, with decimals, or with commas or periods, etc?
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:18:19
There's more in the testnet 
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:12:47
Help me understand how previous states become invalid, if you can broadcast them at any time.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:44:35
Does location really matter? I thought length determined difficulty?
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:54:46
Could someone explain how they don't support segwit but withdrawals to segwit wallets work with no issue? Perhaps a technical explanation would help.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:50:02
This was coinbase's fault
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:24:02
Cool, so both segwit formats are backwards compatible even if it doesnt utilize segwit features

I think he's saying a lot of shills were advertising "the next bitcoin". Snapchat has the same problem
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:58:30
I see it differently in this context. Median transaction on chain shouldn't be used because its value is the total of the inputs less the miner fees -- we cant distinguish the intended amount transfered when there are multiple outputs (such as change addresses). On LN there is no change concept. The amounts paid for an invoice are the intended amounts transferred. Apples and oranges.
Edit: Here's an example 
Transaction amount is 1.28921008 BTC with multiple outputs. We dont know if it was a payment for 
0.4605598 BTC or 
0.82865028 BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:10:17
You don't have to run a node. You can utilize LN simply by opening a channel.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:00:56
Coinbase does this sometimes 
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:15:26
Direct from trezor, ledger, etc
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:23:58
Ahhhh! Is this the cooperative vs uncooperative closing types?
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:32:26
I'm not an expert, but maybe by not broadcasting yourself as a node, then whitelisting your peers
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:42:45
How do you calculate median when it includes change addresses?
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:41:33
Replace the coinbase step with a wallet you control and supports legacy addresses or use a wallet that supports both
@_date: 2019-07-09 03:19:09

Aren't those other coins going to face the same problems? What are their solutions when larger blocks become full from increased usage?
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:01:28
Ah i see now... the app calls BTC legacy. You need to figure out if the source of your "coins" were btc or bch
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:06:23

Wasn't me. Happy to show you what is possible though!
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:16:16
Basically, yeah. But the keys should be the same and you control it, which is hopeful. Question is how easy does this wallet make exporting the private key. First check the BTC wallet though... If it'll automatically share addresses between BTC/BCH wallets
@_date: 2014-07-03 07:19:45

Receiving address as in what is the address you sent coins to. This would be an address generated by Bitcoin wallet. Check this wallet app wherever you're using Bitcoin (btc) or Bitcoin Cash (bch)
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:10:22
Oh. Oh.. Legacy address format. If you switch to the BTC wallet does it share the same addresses? I'm not familiar with this wallet. But if you have the private keys for BCH you should be able to access them on BTC through some exporting
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:49:02
Is the wallet synced? Did you check the txid on a blocks explorer to make sure it was broadcasted?
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:58:06
Mislead perhaps? Read the reviews for that app. Kind of explains it
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:38:42

This is confusing. Why does it show personal wallet 0.00 BCH at the bottom? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:03:44
And the address was generated in the legacy wallet? If yes, you should see it
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:52:17
Find the transaction id in coinbase. Then copy paste it into blockchain.info search box.  "Bitcoin wallet" refers to many apps, which one specifically?
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:12:59
I know electrum makes importing private keys easy. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:06:17
I asked my CU before making a large transaction and they had no policy on it. I also requested them to make note about it in their system. Also noted to contact me if it ever becomes an issue.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:40:22
The app is dependent on the bitcoin library they use, which is currently implementing segwit support
@_date: 2014-07-11 17:55:26
Doesn't look like they're using a payment processor. I just got an address to send to within 5 minutes and after I sent it completed and that was easy. Doesn't get easier than that! Maybe they're holding onto their coins :)

To create a transaction offline I saved brainwallet.org's static website to an offline computer by cloning their 
Then from my offline computer I use the Transactions page to create my transaction. You will have to manually input your address history since your computer is offline. Copy the data from  address&gt; to your offline computer.
Then once you set up your transaction, copy its raw data at the bottom to an online computer.
Submit it at  or if you have bitcoind running use the 'sendrawtransaction' command.

Who is LNBIG? My initial reaction seeing them on the stats pages is that they're flooding the charts with a lot of their nodes and those nodes are popular because they're connecting to their own nodes.

ie I take a private key ( generated on a device that was NOT exposed to the internet ( and store that key in a text file, hand written, or printed from an airgapped printer. It does not require electronic storage.

Pay for online products/services without providing personal information. Donate to a cause or software development. Offer small/big jobs to the world and pay clients in bitcoin.

I checked bitaddress and it does not have this feature. Regarding private key, you need it to sign on your offline component. So I see the difference with yours. Create online then sign offline. When I do this I do everything offline. Unspent data still needs to be copied from an online source though. I just transfer it in a txt file via usb.

How about an exchange I've likely heard of?
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:40:34
I use an offline copy of brainwallet to do exactly that. Go to transactions tab. I use bitaddress sometimes I thought it had something like this.

Lowes and footlocker did not have scanners so the cashier at both manually entered the numbers from the Gyft app.

I've bought lots of stuff using gyft app.

What does this company do?
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:44:43
No luck. It did not show an update so I uninstalled and reinstalled. Still no option to buy gift cards. The release is dated 5/9. If they're currently pushing updates maybe it takes a while for Google Play to propagate or something.
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:51:18
They still have time to renew it with late fees. It takes 75 days for a domain to expire and be available for someone else.

Since I downgraded to the 2gb dropbox I only have several containers ranging from 50 to 200mb each. But I once tested with a gb file and it worked the same... syncing just the deltas. True crypt used block encryption so the entire file isn't changed.
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:18:00
Doesn't work on my nexus 7. Works on my Droid 3. I cannot find any option to actually purchase gift cards for bitcoin or any currency. As far as I can tell they're just a "gift card wallet" and you need to obtain gift cards elsewhere and then add it to Gyft. From here you select your imported gift card, show the in-store cashier the on-screen barcode and scan it. Anyone else have any luck actually buying gift cards?
@_date: 2013-05-11 05:08:31
Gyft is huge but this, if real, is freakin huge! I see BillPay everywhere online from banks to ecommerce.
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:50:19
Confirmed! This works for me :D
Hopefully there is a self purchase option but sending to myself via email/phone number is still a huge step!

Any Bitcoin promos for domain renewals? I have some domains ready for renewal and wanted to check first :D
@_date: 2013-06-07 20:01:49
Yea. That's why I make sure to unmount and sync before using it again elsewhere. If there is a conflict Dropbox will create a dated copy like it does for any file. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 18:23:43
False. Truecrypt uses block encryption and dropbox syncs just those deltas. Source: I do this daily

It's laughable if they were trading BTC for BTC like you describe, but they're trading fiat for BTC. Hard cash is what's forcing them to meet in person.
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:51:52
Just figured it out using Konryou's directions. You need to use the 'Send a Gift Card' option and send it to yourself. This is freakin awesome!!!!!
@_date: 2013-09-04 00:16:59
Gyft uses bitpay. Bitpay takes top exchanges closest each other and take the highest bid. This excludes gox. Read bitpay's exchange rate page. Thia applies to any vendor using bitpay.

Since paying with BTC is considered like a wire transfer, what is the buyer responsible for as far as taxes, reporting, or other types of paper work before and after the vehicle purchase?

They will scale as needed. Mtgox was not prepared for the influx caused by the media, but managed to get through it. They've already mentioned a new and more efficient trading engine in the works, but it takes months to test and in the meantime all they can do with the current one is use better hardware.
