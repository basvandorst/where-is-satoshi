The funny thing is everything is down,  and bcash is down more than btc in terms of percentage.

I'm not sure how to explain it more clearly.  Right now bitcoin is worth a decent amount.  In the future people suspect it will be worth a lot more,  and it will be a more readily available form of payment.  How is that not profit? 
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:15:54
Bitcoin gains worth over time, and  more and more institutions and businesses adopt bitcoin as a payment option. 
 Imagine paying anything,  rent,  gas, groceries,  bills, with bitcoin. That's the point. You don't have sell them any more, they are currency you can use anywhere.

I like the idea of buying a little every day and hodling instead of day trading,  but that said I'm not going to set up anything to auto buy. 
Instead I've been watching weekly for a dip, and buying on the dip. The last two weeks have been great for that. Just a bit more fun and possibly more profitable. Sad to say I'm not in the 1BTC club yet but I only really started this year. 
The only reason I've been thinking to sell a little BTC is to diversify into a couple different coins.

Agreed. The whole thing is sketchy at best,  but hey,  free money. Just install the bch software on a pc I don't care about, and wipe it after.

I'll ask this, what other cryptocurrency is becoming a household name? Sure you can rattle off 100 or more alt coins,  but this discussion wasn't about alts,  just BTC. I have a few coins in different alts.  I don't regularly  buy them anymore but I track their prices and record them from day to day in my spreadsheets. 
Sure another crypto could take the lead.  But for now there is BTC leading the pack.  How many places are accepting etherium or litecoin, or dash,  or ripple, or whatever coin you want to talk about?  Not many.  Meanwhile BTC is actively becoming a standard in places like Venezuela, for a variety of reasons, such as: their government's currency is in hyperinflation, and is unstable, and electricity is free or cheap there. BTC is now easy to mine there,  and a good alternative people are actively using every day. 
You could say that crypto is a waste of electricity, but with so many options for renewable energy, it's hard to argue is harmful to the environment. 
How harmful to the environment is actual currency?  Copper pennies?  Well you have to mine copper. Transfer the ore,  smelt the ore,  press it into usable sheets,  stamp out each coin,   distribute  the new coins. Moving tons of copper around can't be cheap or easy,  so every step of the way you're using oil or electricity to move tons of metal. How does a single penny compare in cost to the environment to a single BTC? And that's just pennies.  More metal,  nickel,  zinc,  silver,  etc,  all smelted and processed to make various coins. Paper money takes harvesting crops for the fibers, washing them with special chemicals, inks and even metals embedded into some of them,  special printing processes, man hours. Certainly sounds like even printing money is hard on the environment.
So your argument that cryptocurrency is harmful to the environment is laughable at best.  With solar, wind,  hydro or even nuclear, crypto would have the smallest footprint of all currency.

Can you instantly send a decimal of a beanie baby or a MTG card across the world? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:07:44
There's no true way to know what the currency will do. 
However I will offer these facts: There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin (BTC), many yet to be mined, and some already lost. It is a currency that completely bypasses the need for exchange rates or bank fees (though it has its own fees), so if you want to send money to your friends or support a cause in any country, no big deal. BTC is divisible to 8 decimal places so you can buy 1 BTC for $9000, or 0.1 for $900, or 0.01 for $90. These are facts about BTC.
My own comments about BTC: since investing from just earlier this year my return on investment is 229%. I finally have a safety net of savings, something I've never had in my life. My only regret is not doubling down earlier,  but I had bills to pay. Invest what you can afford to lose,  and what you can afford to not see again for at least a year.  That's my suggestion. Holding for a year should lower your capital gains taxes. Don't try and day trade or short or anything.  Just put money in at regular intervals,  every week or every month and start saving up. Use BTC whenever you can,  but remember there will be taxes to consider. 
BTC is entirely worth it in my mind.  When the dust settles on this 9k goal,  it will most likely drop,  and slowly rise back up, just look at the other all time highs. 
If you buy, do your research, find an exchange that has minimal or no fees. Not to shill,  but I'm using gdax, which is owned by Coinbase. Coinbase has an easy interface, with high fees. I suggest starting there,  buying a small amount,  and learning how to manage that small amount.  If it is for you,  try GDAX. Gdax has all the trading tools you want,  but is more complex,  with basically no fees. 
Always move your coins off an exchange. Learn about hardware wallets. At minimum have your wallet on your pc or laptop, and consider a cold storage wallet like trezor.
Is it too late?  No one can be sure.  Many said BTC was dead at $600. Many speculate it could be worth 10 times what is at right now, or more. If global adoption occurs, I personally feel like we are still in the infancy of BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:30:19
It would be funny to see that,  but really I'm not worried.  
If my BTC only sold for 1/3rd the current price I would still just about break even. I'm really not rich.  Rich people would laugh at how little I have.  But for once I'm not scared that I have no savings.  It's so nice.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:39:42
Then we are at an impasse,  because I think differently. 
Invest in what you wish.  I'm not putting all my money in BTC, I do have a bank account and savings,  you don't have to worry about me going broke if it crashes.  I'd just be sad.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:57
And yet, now you have more bitcoin.
If you don't have any belief that bitcoin itself has value why the heck are you buying it?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:18:22
I may sell enough to recoup my investment and leave the remainder alone,  but I haven't decided yet. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:26:32
I never used it so I sorta ignored the news,  but wasn't nicehash a scam?

You should be able to login to gdax with your coinbase credentials. It's the same company,  very different sites. 
Coinbase is incredibly user friendly: you want $50 to BTC? Verify your bank info and boom you buy $50 worth of BTC. Sell?  Just as easy.  You cannot do trading things like limit or stop orders. Coinbase also has high fees, and a 1 week wait period to get your BTC after you've purchased it. 
GDAX is a stock market for BTC. You can do all the limit and stop orders and such that are normal tools for trading.  But here's the real reason to use gdax - the fees are much much lower.  However the drawback is you have to have money in your gdax account before you can buy anything, which takes about a week to clear once you transfer it.  
Ultimately if you're going to buy BTC once,  and you just want to buy it now,  coinbase is ok for that.  If the price is where you want it (like if it's dipped to an amount you think is low enough) you can catch that price using coinbase. 
If you're going to invest into BTC repeatedly,  I highly suggest gdax, because the coinbase fees will stack up. It takes a bit longer, since you have to wait on your funds to clear,  but if you just invest that amount weekly,  you'll always have it ready the next week.

I know why it's dropped so rapidly,  I kept buying a little each drop,  meaning of course it would inevitability drop more on me. 
Then I saw it at its recent lowest and say to myself, 'hmm it'll go lower'. Nope, $500 spike up. 
Such is life.

There's still no tracking.  There are raids,  where you fight one big (usually rare) pokemon at a gym and possibly get it.  But you need a group to bring them down, only have a few chances to get that pokemon. Oh and you have to buy raid passes to enter a raid,  which,  surprise, cost the in game currency. So you either have to save up all your coins you earn from having pokemon in gyms,  or spend real money to raid. 
Other than that they added weather based changes to pokemon,  so if it's raining or something in your area,  water type pokemon would have boosted stats when you catch them. 
Still no trading pokemon,  still no fighting other players,  still not a great game imo. I downloaded it this past week to just try it again and I've already deleted it.

So far, it's easy,  but seems like higher fees. You'll have wait times of several days from buying to receiving. Easy to use, no extras interface. But I'm trying gdax too, waiting for my money to arrive now.  
Coinbase is nice because if you see the price drop, you can snap it up quickly. Gdax is supposed to have much less fees, but you have to wait longer to move your money in, unless you do wire transfer, which costs money.
Also I'm very new to BTC. At least to owning them.

Coinbase has a 5k limit per week. Not all at once,  but much faster than $100 at a time.

I noticed my limit just went up to 7500. I guess it changes, my mistake.

May I ask, what exchange are you planning to use to sell bcc for btc? The two I'm currently using don't look like they are supporting bcc, at least not immediately.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:28:26
I'll look into that one.  Thanks! 
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:21:07
Yup same here. I'm not playing with much btc, I'm still holding some, but I've been trying to increase from timing buys and sells. 
I had an auto sell kick in at 5700 or so, and then whoops, it hasn't been down since then. I still have a profit in what I'm trading, it's just annoying.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:42:12
This isn't "oh god,  the sky is falling", it's "oh look,  btc are on sale right now". How people forget that every time,  idk.
