@_date: 2018-01-16 23:00:20
bitcoin and ice poseidon? you go outside bro?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:31:39
Theyre banking on the chance it will go much higher than the 50k
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:54:06
Ive made .013 btc in this bear market
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:59:33
btc sent. god speed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:44:38
Big fiat money players will begin manipulation of the price 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:46:09
opportunity to buy more bro
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:14:34
Transfer to my wallet and I'll pay you on patpal
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:25:35
If I'm wrong there will be less chances to buy low 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:29:30
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:59:50
on a serious note I feel like I remember reading that the fbi had a ton of btc
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:28
Maybe its not working correctly
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:36:45
Literally no risk in making it
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:04:12
I've made btc daytrading
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:06:50
Thus the nature of opinions
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:35:56
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:56
you spelled 21k wrong
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:08:28
Just wait.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:06:14
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:57:01
Going to be many more like that before rising above 17
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:05:36
nothing big
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:04:18
Real estate is another commodity not prone to inflation 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:26:07
It's what I would expect to some degree
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:49:12
Unless you put some btc on it prediction is worthless
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:10:12
That amount I invested is inconsequential so no loss but could grow to something nice
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:29:38
My buy order is set at 3800 and with this trend it could hit within the week
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:02:28
IMO natural resistance to the rise of btc. Did people expect blue chip fin institutions to accept btc right away? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:27:18
0 the way its looking
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:33:31
Probably not a lot of profit left for people really concerned about this
