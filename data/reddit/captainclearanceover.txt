So you really think there will be a bot which will be smart enough to control humans and give them tasks (complicated tasks that no bot can even do, cz otherwise what's the point?), but this very same bot will not be able to go to a bank's website and parse the HTML and send a couple of POST requests?
This whole topic shows great deficits in comprehension of objective reality and is more like a "cool science fiction" novel.

This is like the biggest question every time any big institution mentions using "blockchain". I've tried and tried and tried to understand this, but it simply seems to come down to either
1) Major through-and-through stupidity and complete lack of understanding of how a Blockchain works and that it doesn't make sense within a singular confined and centralized institution, that it will just waste resources.
2) Major ignorance within the use of the term "blockchain" using it for other data structures. 
3) Just using it as a marketing act in order to gain more attention from public/investors.

BISQ is way to complicated to use. Too many steps, too many numbers, too many complicated terms. An average person (even in Bitcoin) will never be using it, they will always opt for something simpler. It is clear that BISQ is designed by coders who don't really understand people. Does it have good engineering? Sure, it's stable. But it will not grow if they don't change interface and the logic behind it.

The futures contracts that you are talking about have a volatility clause, which says that if the Bitcoin price moves about 20% in a day or something like that - the futures trading will stop. So I don't think that those contracts will contribute to any larger price swings than that.

This bill is about Controlled Foreign Companies. It is actually a rather healthy law that works against storing the money offshore. Most european countries have laws like that for example. This will help Russian people, if anything, and make it harder for the rich ones who are trying to escape taxes in Russia. 
Don't see how this is "Plan B" against anything, this is actually a good development.
@_date: 2014-12-01 00:14:03
Read the article. It's not about the capital controls. The title of the reddit post kind of suggests that it is, but it isn't. The actual article is about CFC law, which governs how the companies offshore which are owned by Russian individuals and firms are taxed. That they should be taxed as companies in Russia (based on certain exceptions and rules of course).
Once again, this is only bad news for large companies that try to stash their operations offshore to avoid taxes. This is good news for an average person, since the government will receive more money from these corrupt companies. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:46:59
While Bitcoin is a great invention and has a lot of uses, how exactly is it going to help against black money and avoided taxes? (Which is what I assume is meant by "stashed overseas"). If anything, Bitcoin will provide yet another way for dishonest companies to stash the money on an unknown anonymous address, and either avoid taxes or hide the money which were generated in some way they don't want anyone to know about...
Instead of stashing overseas they are going to be stashed in Bitcoin. Is it any better?

Well there are obviously issues, there is no single easy answer. (Some of your  points are not very related though, like SSL. MITM risk does not depend on JavaScript being used. Everyone everywhere should definitely use SSL)
But in general, of course it's not that simple. I just meant that JS for *the same function* (which, yes, is also a bit abstract, since the exact same function might not exist in the same way on client-side as on server-side) as a server-side alternative is going to be better for performance, especially with a lot of users. 
Also I'm pretty sure the crawlers thing will be pretty easy to fix by spitting out static (non-JS) pages based on the user-agent. 
Anyways, I think irrespective of these issues the price he pays is WAY too much, I am not defending those thiefs.

And another point - there is no "less freedom" from this law. The law simply states that if you OWN assets which simply have been registered offshore for tax purposes, you still have to tax them. Nobody limits you on where you send your money.
Quote The document amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation regarding the TAXATION of income from Russian controlled companies abroad.
This is a very healthy law for the economy.
Laws like this are promoted by the OECD and are devised to stop the largest companies from evading tax which then has to be paid by the poorest people in the country.
Also this: "According to the new law, the minimum profit that needs to be declared will be $1.2 million (50 million rubles) in 2015, $670,000 (30 million rubles) in 2016, and $220,000 (10 million rubles) after 2017."

Being a person who understands both Russian language and knowing some of specific circumstances for that company I can say that they are not trying to hide the fact that they are a pyramid. They didn't try to hide it back in the original MMM either. The most astonishing thing about this company and specifically their director Mavrodi is that in every interview he does not take a stance of trying to say they are not a pyramid, and instead is trying to convince listeners that a pyramid is a good thing. That the current money system is so inherently corrupt and a pyramid system is a way out. And he makes a damn good job at at.
Not well enough to convince anyone working with money obviously, but well enough to convince a lot of "normal" people. He is also very good at dodging specific questions and re-make them into other questions or statements about the current system which are too complicated for a normal person to understand, thus effectively convincing them that the current system with banking/normal money is even more corrupt than the pyramid scheme he is proposing.
Basically, he is not arguing it's a pyramid, he is saying his pyramid can go on for forever/very long time, and when it's grown completely, it will be a better economical system than the current one.

The connection is that when more taxes are taken from the rich, the poor have to pay less. 
What is your problem with this? This law has made it more difficult for the richest part of russians to hide their money and escape (already low) taxes. How the hell is this a bad thing in your world?
Also, yes, the government from the beginning was created to serve people. And even though a lot of taxes get stolen, there is still a budget that serves people, yes. 
If you blatantly assume that everything a government does is evil, then you're going to complain on whatever law gets passed, no matter what the law actually says. What is the point in discussing it then? Just go and stand with that unemployed crowd on occupy wallstreet that are angry but are too dumb to understand what they're angry about, and instead of going for specific changes, are simply chanting things like "screw wallstreet".

In Russia it's not hard to shut down anyone for any generic reason. This was especially the case in 1994. Basically if you share with the government, you can go on for very long time. If you don't, they'll find a way to get you.
Interestingly, Mavrodi commonly uses the fact that he has been shut down by the government as an argument that his pyramid scheme works: the government was actually causing the specific cataclysm event of breaking the pyramid. It didn't collapse on it's own. The argument works unbelievably well with semi-uneducated Russian people who commonly share a distrust (not without a reason obviously) for their corrupt government.

You sound like you get the essence of this corruption anyway, but to get really all the details and ensure yourself that this is the actual way the US government works right now, I would highly recommend book "The Creature from Jekyll Island", it's about how FED was formed.
Here the author is making a small presentation about it 
The way in which the system is broken should not even be considered a conspiracy theory. All the details of this plot are completely visible, everybody can actually see all the gears of this machine of corruption. There are no excuses for this system, not even people involved in it ever give any explanation for why this system would be favorable to the country and all of it's people. It is simply a case of corrupt government. The question is not in whether the system is invalid, the question is how can this invalidity be put an end to. As any other case of such highly evolved corruption (just look at the 3d world countries, problems there are basically the same, they're just not as intricate), the monster is not an easy thing to kill, even if all the intestines of the creature are perfectly visible.

BCH people want everyone to call it "Bitcoin Cash" instead of bcash, to steal Bitcoin's brand value. Help Bitcoin by calling it "bcash"!
For all intents and purposes, BCH is an altcoin. They haven't done any of the actual development, they haven't brought any real value to the system, they simply copied the existing codebase and changed a small feature of it. It is natural that people have started calling it "bcash" or other names.
However, I have noticed that people behind BCH understand that having the word "Bitcoin" in their name gives them the credibility and trust that they want in order to keep pumping their altcoin.
If you wanna help bitcoin, make sure to call it "bcash" or something else. Make sure the publically accepted name for it will not become "Bitcoin Cash". That word rightfully belongs to real Bitcoin, the innovation behind it and people who have invested their real time and value in it (like core devs).
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:37:05
Because they haven't done anything for making it work, they simply stole all of it from the core team.
Taking the Bitcoin code, and changing a small detail, and releasing it as a different coin has been done before many times: and they are rightfully called altcoins. It's not fair to either devs or the users to actually call it anything "Bitcoin".

This has been going for years. Bitstamp is the worst exchange in this regard, they have the most cowardly compliance team in history. They have a choice how to implement KYC, the regulator does not force to do it in this way exactly. Many other exchanges in similar jurisdictions are much better, so it's obviously not because of the law. They are just cowards that over-protect themselves from regulator blaming them for anything in the future. Obviously at the cost of the user experience.

Some companies will close, people will lose jobs, some loans will default, some restructuring to physical assets will take place. The government will reset and restart the system.

They'll just make up a new fiat currency or default on loans. There is no problem in restarting the system. They'll say that the new Fed operates on some new rules that will prevent this in the future, which will of course be a lie, the cycle will repeat itself. The point of fiat money is not to never have crisies. It is to keep the system running in between these periods - which it has been doing quite well. Some people might lose jobs etc while the crisies happen, but the system as a whole wins on this in the long-term.

Why exactly can't he cash out? The only thing that they are trying to prevent him from cashing out is that Tether has "told everyone" to not accept funds from a certain address. It will take long time before every exchange, every shop and every person on localbitcoins, etc - will hear this and/or update their wallet. Of course they can "cash out" in the mean time. 
Cashing out does not have to mean "get real USD for USDT" - noone can do it at all anyway. Cashing out means getting other real cryptocurrency instead of his USDT...
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:57:25
When the coin was worth less, it was much easier to buy more coin, and have higher (bitcoin-denominated) balances of that coin, for the same amount of actual value (USD-denominated, or re-calculated into gold or something). In that case, paying the same 80 sat/byte would mean that you have to a pay a much smaller fraction of the transaction volume into fees.
So if he paid 1/5th of the coin now, earlier he would pay 1/10 of the coin, or similar. It makes a lot of sense actually.

It's not a witch hunt, the "attacks" on tether are completely warranted. They have no real reserve, they don't redeem tokens, they don't even pretend to be able to redeem the tokens in the future, they are obviously illegal, and the wording in their rules is clearly trying to avoid legal issues by being vague. Once a real regulator even glances at their model, the whole thing is going to collapse under it's own weight.

If you pretend that you accept bitcoin for other merchants, and then you don't display neither an address nor the amount on your invoice, so that people can send a bitcoin transaction - then you do not support bitcoin. BitPay are assholes.

You grossly misunderstand the concept of open-source. 
OSS does not mean that "we are open about having this thing in our software and we write about it in our TOS". 
OSS means that you have access to the (duh) source code: you can browse it, you can read it, but you can also modify it and send your modifications, and they will be included in the code base, if they are good enough. Try doing that with Windows.

Lol that means exactly that the real inflation is not 2%. 
If you just compare the actual prices, the inflation has been far larger than 2%. Don't believe government statistsics. US governmenet specifically has been shifting their statistics methods to keep the "official" inflation numbers low. This has nothing to with objective reality.

Bitstamp is very shitty when it comes to KYC. They don't just ask for the minimum needed, they ask 10 (sic) questions about your account like what you do and who you are going to be receiving money from. Then they do this every couple of months again, and you have to provide new answers. Just search for this, it's known that Bitstamp do this.

Do you even know the problems and risks merchants have to go through to accept Visa? (chargebacks and such?)
I'm not a shill, but accepting Bitcoin-ish payment methods (irreversible, sort of instant, backed by crypto, no involvement of people) - is actually much easier for the merchants.

For one thing, they out of the blue started requiring that each transaction be made with "Bitcoin payment protocol", instead of normal transfers. They even removed the option to do it as a normal transfer. Payment protocol requires a specialized wallet, and it cannot be used over Tor or VPN because their shitty implementation sends all the connections through cloudflare or some other shit, and those wallets cannot solve a captcha.
To be clear: if you wanna pay an invoice, they will not even display an Address/Amount combination to you!

Yes, government intervention is major systemic threat to bitcoin. This is not news. So you would be very stupid to just sleep happily and think that nothing can happen to it. 
Pirating music is not the same thing at all. For example: imagine there being no exchanges now. How useful would bitcoin be? About 1% of it's usefulness now? 
And all exchanges that exists currently have licenses for governments! Try to run an unlicensed exchange and see what happens to you and how long it takes before SWAT comes kim.com-style.
It would not even be hard for governments to revoke those licenses whenever they want if they want to. So far they hadn't been wanting to, that's it.

They don't. They don't even give you an option to display it. Instead you have to use some other wallet that has to use "bitcoin payment protocol" and by extension compromise your privacy.

If people ask you questions about bitcoin, and you won't or can't spend hours explaining all the details to them and answering the same layman question over and over - your best bet is to point them to Andreass' work. He is the best at explaining the bitcoin to anyone. That's just a fact.

You're very naive to think that there are no ways to hide assets nowadays. To quote John Mcaffe to a journalist saying "I'm following the money",

Windows is closed source. Saying that some 0.001% of their code is open source, like some drivers is like a fart in a hurricane.
Not only is it closed source, it has been shown to have keyloggers activated by default in a clean installation, "telemetry data", commercials by default in the start menu in an OS that is bought... To make Windows really useful you have to spend a couple of days cleaning all the shit from it and deactivating spy functions.

Not true. Just go to any benchmarking site like " and compare single-core performance values.
Also the single-threadedness of old software is not such a big problem anymore in practice. The creation of the stack (processors, languages, OSes, frameworks) that take advantage of parrallel computations has been going on for like the last 10 years, and have come very far indeed.

And the amount of votes received by your comment just shows the inherent inadequacy of this reddit, which is almost as prone to inaccurate populistic thinking based on lack of education within the general population, as any other news site. The fact that people even upvote the source image itself and other such senseless things shows major deficits in comprehension of the underlying technology. Your comment, which is like the first sane one in the list is like 4 pages down, with top-voted comments being "let's include bittorrent" etc. Like it would have made any difference to the senselessness of the comparison...

It's not the borrowing that's the problem, it's the borrowing of the money that doesn't exist. Central banks and the banks that loan from them are effectively borrowing out money that they don't have. They are creating it out of nothing. Instead of only lending out a part of the deposits that they get from their clients (which is a sound banking practice that is usually good for everyone), the lend out many times more than they have in the deposits...
Even just simply printing more money would be better than the fractional banking we have today, at least the scheme would be transparent and inflation would be predictable. (Although the best thing would be to have a fixed money supply, like Bitcoin has.). The thing we have now is an unpredictable monster which is designed to hide the negative effects of the scheme for as long as possible, only to finally bust in spectacular ways, exploding all the accumulated effects of the corruption all at once. 
None of this is secret. All details of this whole scheme, how it operates up to roles of specific institutions, who gains from all this etc, it's all public knowledge. If you want to educate yourself on this, I highly recommend the book "A Creature from Jekyll island" by G. Edward Griffin.

&lt;spellnazi&gt;If they pretend to know everything about those things, perhaps they should start with spelling it correctly?
Quote from torproject.org: Note: even though it originally came from an acronym, Tor is not spelled "TOR". Only the first letter is capitalized. In fact, we can usually spot people who haven't read any of our website (and have instead learned everything they know about Tor from news articles) by the fact that they spell it wrong.

He basically says "Unfortunately, the contest is useless. Neither users nor Telegram developers will learn anything from it. But Telegram will still be able to point to it and say, “Look! No one has won the contest, so our software is secure!” Naive users will believe it, and they will feel safe using dangerously broken encryption.", and it's probably not far from truth.
A successful attack on the protocol might be very possible with other resources only available to large governments, like processing power or even subpoenas, so even if the reward never gets paid out, this doesn't mean much... 
However it is great to see that Bitcoin is now mentioned as a de-facto standard for such rewards.

They talk about whole-drive encryption, a function where your whole system is encrypted and you have to enter a password before even booting the OS. This requires low-level support of the disk partition system, and Windows 8 uses a system not currently supported by TrueCrypt.
