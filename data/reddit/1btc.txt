No, 5-6k this year is not remotely realistic. I have serious doubts we'll be up to 1000 again. 
Who do you know that's interested in buying BTC but is waiting to pay 10x more ? I'm not sure there are greater fools out there than the people who paid $1100 each

It's nice that you can be so willfully ignorant though. You'd better pray the bitcoin network grows several orders of magnitude, because it's either that or you're looking at $20-$30 transaction fees, if not more, in about ten years.

I don't know where you got this data but that doesn't sound anywhere near the lowest housing prices in Canada. You can do much better than that in SE Ontario for under $200k. 
Relative to Alberta and the rest of BC that is pretty cheap, though. 
Back to your topic...how do you think a cryptocurrency can help your local economy? People buy Bitcoins...and then what? How is digital money going to bring in money for your high school repairs, or do anything to stimulate your economy? Are you just hoping everybody owns Bitcoins and then bitcoin prices go up so suddenly everyone is rich? What happens if your local high school invested their repair budget into BTC and then the price dropped, or stayed the same? How is that doing anything to help the situation? 
Big cities have better shopping and enjoy larger economies-of-scale. Bitcoin isn't going to do anything to change that. 
I'm genuinely interested what you're thinking here. Lay out for me how you think Bitcoin will change any of the problems you mentioned.

I don't think many people expect the first cryptocurrency to be the best or last. It's a grand experiment, there's bound to be kinks to improve upon. Adjusting to accomplish something beneficial to society versus just solving arbitrary math problems to "secure the network" (which Permacoin claims to do just as well) is kind of a no-brainer.


To the average joe "accomplishing something" vs "accomplishing nothing" is a pretty good reason.

Except Visa does thousands of transactions every second and all costs included it's still probably way less than $40 per transaction. 
Oh , and in a few years the block reward will be smaller and fees will grow to subsidize the miners. After that , the block reward eventually disappears and the currently-small transaction fee will skyrocket

@_date: 2014-07-01 18:55:55


For the lender, sure. It makes no sense for me to borrow 1 BTC and owe you 1.1 BTC because not only do I have to come up with .1 BTC (which might be worth more than 10% of my original loan) but the value of the original 10 BTC might *also* rise. 
A better, more realistic real-world example is a mortgage. Let's assume BTC are $600 each, and I lend you 333.33 of them for a $200,000 house. You owe me 366 Bitcoins at the term. 
This means not only do you owe me 33 bitcoins as interest, but the increased value of each bitcoin. Nobody can predict the volatility but if some "to the mooners" have their way you could end up owing $1M on a $200,000 house bought today. 
Since bitcoin is (supposed to be) deflationary, it only makes sense for you to lend me 333 BTC and expect 333 BTC in return. You still get a return, assuming the price of BTC rises, and I'm not burdened with a debt too unreasonable to ever repay. Why would you ever lend at negative or no interest? You wouldn't. It makes no sense...which is again why large-scale loans are not feasible for bitcoin.

*This* is comically wrong. It's pretty strange to see people here assume this auction is going to set the new standard price or jumpstart the next bubble. You really think the general public, or even the yet-to-buy investors are going to be ready to pay $900 per BTC (assuming the auction went that high) knowing people have *already* paid more than $1100 per Bitcoin. 
You're acting like people and investors in general are totally retarded people who forget the past few months and seeing a bid on $900 Bitcoins is going to make them forget people already overpaid for $1000+ bitcoins a few months ago. What precedent is this auction supposed to set, in your opinion? It's certainly not the general worth or "true valuation" of a bitcoin. 
Silbert could have bid $2000 per Bitcoin, it doesn't matter. Overpaying, paying market price, whatever, it's not going to have a significant effect. It's a couple days worth of BTC being bought by people almost certainly already invested in BTC

Oh dear god. You're totally missing his dad's point. The price of BTC is listed in fiat currencies, there's no effort to maintain a baseline where a loaf of bread costs x BTC, therefore when BTC takes over fiat it will be worth, what, $10,000 worthless fiat dollars? 


AKA bitcoin is useful for transacting anonymously on the internet for illegal goods and for money laundering without bank oversight.
This is legit what bitcoin is actually useful for that can't be accomplished with fiat


AKA no regulation. The "participants in the network" have been ripped off to the tune of over $500M because the bitcoin network is basically unregulated and there's no reversing fraudulent transactions
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:12:41


You haven't been paying attention. There are much bigger and better counter-arguments to bitcoin than "it's used for drugs"
Mining alone is a scourge on the environment and results in each transaction costing more than $30 in block rewards
see: blockchain.info/stats
There, you just "heard and saw" a bigger, more realistic problem. Shall I go on?
Oh, and just because cash is great for illegal commerce doesn't mean that it's a good idea to introduce another payment mechanism that's even *more* anonymous than cash. 
If I want to buy an AK47 with cash, I still have to physically hand over cash. It's therefore less anonymous than transferring bitcoins. 


This isn't necessarily true. 


yes having a stable and reliable value year after year is laughable...right...
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:08:13


Ahaha. haha. ha. What do you think the % chance is that when I use a $20 bill it is counterfeit? what about when I shop online...what are the chances my fiat is counterfeit then? 


I don't pay any fees. I pay my balance every month so I pay literally nothing in interest and have a 0-fee card *with* rewards. What do you think is wrong with fraud protection? I quite enjoy that Visa or MC do that for me. 


because bitcoin has no fraud protection. at all. I'd rather a company pay for some and use their service then take all the risk myself, and so would basically everybody in the world. 


That's not what I said, but I suspect English isn't your primary language. In Youtube and Twitter and Facebooks first five years they had several times more users than Bitcoin. It took all of those companies less than two years to get *more* users than Bitcoin, which is supposed to be a universally-appealing no-brainer.

Thanks for the thorough reply, can you answer some questions that raises for me? 
If there's a maximum number of transactions per block, is there a minimum? If miners get such a great reward (3600 BTC per day) aside from transaction fees, are they obligated to include x% of no fee transactions as well? What's stopping miners from only doing 2 or 3 transactions per block? It seems like we're close to 1MB blocks already, what repercussions does raising the block limit cause? 
Thanks again, great post

I know you want to push Bitcoins on your local merchants but lying to them about doublespending is going to blow up in your face when they eventually blame you for deceiving them

Oh so when the BTC price goes up fees might get cut? That makes sense but everyone would have to agree with that too right? 


What do you mean by "hypothetically" here? Miners dont need block rewards at all do they? If somehow block rewards were lowered or removed and the only compensation was 6c per transaction then some miners would quit and the difficulty would drop, I dont see why block rewards are needed or at least need to be so high 
@_date: 2014-07-06 00:22:15

I think it's realistic because that's *what is occurring right now*. 
You aren't paying this fee, but The Bitcoin Network is. Once Bitcoin stops providing block rewards, miners will hike up the fee to match the missing revenue. 
And yes, you're right, when transaction fees actually paid by the users start to increase people will stop using Bitcoin altogether or switch to a coin with some block rewards left.

What are you even talking about here? The respective companies valuations? You don't trust them with anything, they are valuable because they are popular and/or useful businesses.

Congratulations. Now you remove that $40 reward, stick them with the same electricity bills, and expect them to do the same thing for incredibly small transaction fees. The network runs on charity, and that charity is both getting smaller every so often and eventually coming to an end. 
Moral to this story: Bitcoin is inefficient. I am stunned that you could possibly think otherwise at this point in the conversation. 


This is utterly irrelevant in terms of being competitive as a payment processor. If another coin can do it more efficiently or at least do something *else* with all that electricity, that's a clear advantage.

So what's the point? Off-chain transactions don't (and shouldn't) count towards BTC transaction activity because they aren't actually using bitcoin (the blockchain).

I'm kind of new here but is your post satire or what? I honestly can't tell.

That is...absurd.

Let's start by taking a look at this chart, and imagining what it would look like with 0 electricity cost. You know, the majority of the reason it's not profitable. 
Let's be realistic and acknowledge that difficulty will increase hundreds of times between now and when you earn that block reward you were referencing, ruining the ROI and driving up the relative electricity costs. You argued using disingenuous figures (preorder miner from a company that underdelivers on promises and a static difficulty) as if that was in any was reasonable. 
Again, look at that profit margin, imagine nobody paid for electricity, and tell me you don't think electricity is the majority of the cost. You are so tremendously dense I have no doubts you'll still somehow have trouble here, but please don't bother responding as I won't be ELI5 for you any longer. 
The majority of mining costs are electricity, easily 30-50% of the cost and much, much more (100+%) for dated miners. The inefficiency in the network is a massive problem. Again, I'm shocked you could argue either point because it's all both totally verifiable (so long as you don't make up your own fantasy scenarios) and obvious to most.

I don't think there's any reason to assume bitcoin is undervalued at the moment. The network does about 1 transaction per second vs. credit card's thousands of transactions per second, the overall USD transaction volume hasn't really moved in a year, and with thousands of BTC being mined each day there's much more supply than demand. 
Consider that at exactly this moment Bitcoin could be worth $10 and still function exactly the same (shortage of BTC wouldn't be a problem), it's hard to argue that it's undervalued at several thousand times above actual network utilization needs (market cap)

At this point you've calculated for yourself that BTC costs roughly $40 per transaction. What more proof could you possibly need that this is an inefficient system? Do you also need proof that water is wet and that the sky is blue? Bitcoin is notoriously inefficient. It's common knowledge, and you have statistics in front of you to compare with Visa or MC or Paypal, none of which are anywhere near even $1 per transaction. 
Let's put it this way: If you remove the miner's subsidy from Bitcoin (the block reward), bitcoin becomes a much more efficient system, but also self-destructs. Nobody is going to mine for the cost of transaction fees alone because they are so small they may as well not exist. Without the charity that is the block reward, Bitcoin would die out very quickly. That's all the proof any reasonable person would need that Bitcoin is inefficient. If a product or service needs subsidies and charities to run it must have some inefficiencies.

I don't understand how you couldn't find it logical. 
Your bank account comes with x fees

You didn't meet your end of the agreement, so you were assessed fees. This makes perfect sense and is what you've agreed to.

You mean something supposedly immensely useful as "the future of money" is growing faster than something that required a several-thousand dollar computer to use back in the 90's? Gee, really? Can you think of any reason why comparing those two statistics is useless?
Bitcoin came out in 2009, computers and the internet on smartphones was basically ubiquitous as that point. Comparatively, bitcoin is growing slower than basically any modern popular user software I can imagine. 
You can handwave and justify the reasons why, but Bitcoin is growing tremendously slowly, transaction volume basically hasn't changed in a year, and overall it only offers a niche use, not something appealing or applicable to most average first-world people.

Profits mostly come from the block reward. Without that enormous subsidy, mining wouldn't be profitable for *anybody*. It's like a charity used to keep the bitcoin network running. There won't be any profits once the block reward runs out, so fees will have to be very substantial to keep people mining at that point. 


It may surprise you to learn that most equipment isn't worth buying as you won't even break even due to difficulty. The only people who are profitable are those who have below-average electricity costs. For the average user electricity more than eats up any profit.

It's going to be pretty easy to find people that already own bitcoin to agree with you. Ask one of the billions of people worldwide who haven't touched BTC if they'd rather a network that accomplishes nothing or something that benefits society. The answer is easy and obvious. You've got to understand you have a significant bias here.

yes, FF to now and transaction volume is basically the same. Bitcoin isn't growing nearly as fast as you think it is.

This is not a normal "bitcoin is volatile lol" dip. You should basically cut your losses immediately and buy back in as it goes a bit lower if you still want to play ball. No reason to hold during the dips when you're costing yourself money
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:53:42


No, but for the consumer making the purchase the interactions is basically immediate, which is all that matters. Nobody cares if the merchant waits 3 days for the actual money, they care about not standing in the store for ten minutes waiting for a confirmation. The transaction may not appear on your online statement for a few days but it's still there and you can still pay off purchases you know you made. 
The most important part of commerce is consumer-facing. It doesn't matter how long it takes the merchant to get their money, it matters how quickly I can tap my NFC credit card and walk away. 
Remember, the only reason retailers accept credit/debit cards are for *consumer convenience*.

This doesn't mean anything with regards to the enormous transaction fees you'll see. Congratulations on not even understanding the thing you're mindlessly defending. There's no guaranteed "exponential path" for Bitcoin. 


This, too, is irrelevant. Even decreasing the future tx fee 90% still leaves an enormous $5 per transaction. You basically need to keep providing block rewards forever to continuously delay the enormous spike in tx fees. 
Yes, perhaps people can wait 1-2 hours for a transaction to confirm and pay a paltry $2.50 per transaction. No matter how you slice it, when the block reward evaporates the transaction fees will skyrocket.

Sorry you have bad credit?


The thing you're missing here is that *credit* cards allow you to book a room *without actually putting money down*. You can't use Bitcoins on credit, so yes you can outright pay for a room or a flight but it's money immediately out of your pocket. 
If your argument is "well if my card is maxed I can't use it" that's a consumer problem, not the fault of the credit card issuer. They would also probably be willing to remove the hold if you bothered to call and explain, since credit cards have *customer service*. 
As others have said, Bitcoin isn't really solving any problems here.

Food is a necessity and people will buy it regardless. It's an irrelevant example. 


You buying that TV is essentially confirming my point. You can wait a few months and buy the same TV cheaper, but holding your BTC means buying a better tv cheaper.

So do Bitcoiners, whether its an exchange holding their coins or a third-party app they use to transfer them. Don't lie to yourself, you know you rely on multiple third-parties to use Bitcoins. You wouldn't even be able to spend them at many places without a third party - BitPay. 


Oh so you just pulled numbers out of your ass and don't even know if there is a fee for tipping. That's a great tactic...oh wait no it isn't it just makes you seem like a disingenuous ass. 


This is hilariously naive and ironic because there are fucking hundreds of middle-men Bitcoin companies and more coming every day and you're happy to use them but still preach about getting rid of middlemen. You're happy with BitPay and Circle but not Visa or Mastercard. Open your damn eyes for a minute and think about what you're saying. Bitcoin is made of middlemen and would barely work without them.

No, read it again. You say the $44 includes equipment costs but it doesn't. You say it's probably lower but can't actually back that up with anything. You shouldn't be defending a network that costs at best $20 per transaction because there's really nothing to defend there. Inefficiency is a known problem, not something you can (terribly inarticulately) try to handwave away. 


Nobody made this assertion. 


Miners make a ridiculous profit, something that could be changed to lower the transaction costs of the network except you'll never get the miners to agree because it's against their own self-interests.

If I gave you 1 BTC today you can either buy a 32" TV today or a 60" TV in two months. You and most every other person are going to delay that purchase, this is the problem. I won't donate 1 BTC to charity today because I'd be donating 10x as much within a few years.

Bit of a double-post here but, eh, *shrug*


This is the current cost per transaction. Miners make .21% of their money from fees, and the rest comes from the block reward. The block reward is a charity necessary for the network to run, without which Bitcoin would suffer tremendous hikes in transaction costs. 
The block reward is coming to an end sooner rather than later. By the 2030's 90+% of all BTC will have been mined, which means miners must now find a new source of revenue to pay their electrical/hardware bills. 
The current cost per transactions is over FORTY-FIVE FUCKING DOLLARS PER TRANSACTION. You can expect each and every transaction to cost just as much once the block reward dwindles down to near-nothing. 
But, oh, this is yet another non-problem that anaccountjustforyouu or throwahoymatie will happily hand-wave away.

No. The proof is in our everyday reality where consumerism is rampant. Conversely, there's never been a deflationary economy in practice because of the problems I mention leading to job losses and a down economy
If you don't expect your purchasing power to increase significantly, there's nothing stopping you from spending except for maybe waiting for a black friday sale, but not waiting years for your dollar to appreciate 50%

That's $44 per transaction in terms of the actual network cost for a network running 1 tps worldwide. There's plenty of proof that bitcoin is massively inefficient, you apparently don't care to acknowledge it. I can't do anything about that.

Lots of people here will be happy to encourage you to spend that money, because Bitcoin needs new money to grow. People that own Bitcoin like "anaccountjustforyouu" and "spottedmarley" don't care if you lose your money, they just want people to pay more and more for Bitcoins every month. 
$78 isn't a great return, but $1500 isn't a large investment. If you bought bitcoins last year you could have made some money, but since then the price has been steadily heading down and if you spent $1500 in January you'd have $750 left
You've got a better chance hitting it big if you buy $1500 worth of lottery tickets. Best case scenario in Bitcoin your $1500 grows 10-15%, worst case scenario you lose it to a hacker or the price drops another 50% and making $78 guaranteed starts to look pretty attractive. 


"Investing" in Bitcoins is irresponsible, and I can almost guarantee you will regret it. Please bear in mind this is the only non-biased advice you'll get, nearly everybody else here is happy to see you throw away your money because nobody here is really capable of criticizing bitcoin so you get dumb shit like "maybe you can retire when you're 25" off of $1500.

ASICS aren't "extremely expensive", but that's besides the point. When I buy an ASIC to try and mine some Bitcoins, the cost of that ASIC is *not* included in that $44 per transaction. You insinuated that fixed equipment costs are included...they are not. 
Compare apples to apples. Visa and Microsoft run hundreds of transactions per second for probably less than a penny each, they don't have to deal with increasing difficulty. 
With bitcoin, you buy equipment that may already be obsolete, or may be obsolete within weeks. Not including the cost of equipment, the network costs roughly $40 per transaction to operate. You're yet to argue this statistic with any real merit or factual basis.

No, "most of" doesn't mean "all of". The majority of related mining costs for the average user is electricity. Again, nobody made the assertion you're claiming, and you're being intentionally naive/obtuse


...which is why I said the transaction cost is actually *more than* $44 per transaction if you want to include capital equipment bought for the purposes of mining BTC.  
Here's a quote from you - 


Literally none of that $44 goes into equipment. You said as much yourself

The "cost per transaction" according to blockchain.info is, in fact, the cost the network is bearing.

Right. A bank wouldn't be inclined to lend out the money either. 


That is in fact the point of *all* lending. 


Lending is not a charity, and people don't want to rely on crowdfunded BTC to get a mortgage. They'll want to get 200 BTC directly from a large holder, who you've already recognized won't want to take the risk when you can just hold and make money.

You're contradicting yourself. That $44 doesn't include the cost of equipment. It would be much higher if it included all the GPUs and ASICS used to solely mine Bitcoins. 


This isn't true. The vast and overwhelming majority of that money goes towards electricity bills. 


If you have a computer you have a hard drive. Cheap HD storage is one thing Bitcoin owners love to tout since the blockchain is growing so large.

Why don't you have some more options for people with lots of BTC? "More than 5" is alright but you could easily have done 5-10, 10-25, 25+ or something like that.

Oh right that's why Gox was able to lose millions of dollars worth of BTC that nobody can locate. Super regulated.

Maybe "some people" shouldn't spend money they don't have then? If you have $25 in your bank don't spend $200 and not expect a fee. If you have $500 to deposit do it in person and it will be available immediately.

This isn't a solution to deflation at all though? Dividing your BTC does nothing to encourage people to spend something that will be worth more next week/month/year

...what exactly is that supposed to prove? I know he sent them to a Gox wallet, I'm saying he has very little chance of anybody recovering them. I don't even know if he could list himself as a creditor considering he didn't send it to them for business purposes or anything.

I'm telling you bluntly bitcoin's electrical inefficiency is a significant problem


This may be true to you, but perhaps not to the average user. 
You've got one protocol that accomplishes nothing but "securing the network" and is known to be massively inefficient. 
You've got another one, created by Microsoft,  that apparently accomplishes something and may or may not also be massively inefficient.
From a non-invested perspective this decision is easy. "We know bitcoin works" isn't exactly a great justification for wasting thousands of dollars worth of electricity a day.

Most (if not all) Bitcoin ATMS here in Canada are 1-way, you won't be able to easily just cash out (and you wouldn't want to pay the fees anyway)
Just sell on localbitcoins wherever you travel, or patronize businesses that accept bitcoins

If it goes up he can buy back in for much less, slightly less or at worst the same price he sold for. There's no downside to selling unless it takes you like a week to buy BTC and there's a direct downside to holding during a "dip" (or crash)
The price can drop $50-$100 in an hour depending on some news, as evidenced today. It practically never rises that quickly, and if/when it starts to OP can buy right back in.

I would think transaction fees would have to be pretty close to the current block reward? Assuming difficulty just keeps rising some people will drop out but anybody still mining is going to need at least the same compensation they're getting today.
When is the block reward halving again, anyway?

If my friend isn't a merchant providing me a good or service, how could I be expected to give him money directly with my credit card? Yes, it's using fiat, just like when you use Gyft, or BitPay or CoinBase for 99% of merchants "accepting" BTC. 
If i'm actually "paying" my friend for something then yes I can use my credit card...but that's the same thing as buying a chocolate bar at the corner store with my credit card at that point.

$640 to $575 is nowhere near normal buddy, and China hasn't even woken up yet.

Why would it be the other way around? Not to be a debbie-downer but accepting Bitcoin isn't some amazing sales boon for these companies. Overstock is the most prolific and they have BTC sales ~.1% of their total sales. It's likely going to be the same story with Expedia...they accept bitcoin for sales and then see how little sales come from it.

If you have *any* AmEx they'll take it. They also take Interac debit cards here in Canada, but probably because Interac fees are literally less than one cent per transaction

Do the opposite and just buy when/if you see the current downward trend stop. There's no sense in being on the wrong side of that fence. The price has been bouncing between the 420's and the 450's for a while now, I'd suggest you don't buy until/unless we've gone past $450 for at least two weeks and no longer continuously trending downwards

Somebody already asked you this, but why do you think bitcoin can't fit under any number of existing jurisdictions? It's a currency or a commodity and either way that falls under what they have the power to regulate, though they are making special guidelines for bitcoin it isn't the first time alternate digital cash has been attempted and those payment networks didn't require special snowflake legislation and elections.

Can you really say something is theoretically true when in practice bitcoin has wildly fluctuated in value? Not to downplay the incredible rise of Bitcoin but it also has dropped nearly 50% of it's value in the past year, which isn't exactly as stable as gold
As a Canadian, OP also could have used an Interac money transfer to send money (up to $3000 IIRC) for $1.50. Canada is actually pretty good for banking rates and technology. We have affordable peer to peer banking and widespread NFC use.

Digital CC won't be the only company acting like that, **that's why expect 1 BTC to be back at 600 USD / 470 Euros around December 2014/January 2015.**

@_date: 2015-04-25 16:37:02


I see it like this - if you can't afford to accompanying paperwork and regulations then you can't afford to be serving customers from all 48 states. If you can't afford those fees then you can't be trusted to hold money from that many customers. If shysters like Danny Brewster can raise more than $2m for a "bitcoin bank" with no business plan other than "we hope coins go up!" then an actual businessman should have little trouble raising $2M with a sound business plan. Those whining about regulations and the accompanying expenses ought not to be trusted with millions of dollars in the first place. 
Start in your home state and branch outwards. It's ridiculous to complain that you can't afford to be responsible when you're aiming to run a business that holds millions upon millions of consumer deposits alongside other companies that have been safely storing user funds (and following regulations) for decades. 
Look to your local Credit Union. They follow regulations, they pay fees, and they don't immediately complain that they can't afford to service the entire continental United States

This is incredibly fast compared to opening an account at any bitcoin exchange, though


This is kind of strange, locally we don't have opening fees but there is likely a $5 minimum deposit


There is a 100% likelihood your bank will waive this fee with a minimum account balance. It's also worth noting that the debit card you've been provided by your bank will work at millions of retailers...you can't say the same for opening a "bitcoin account"
You're also ignoring the fact that Bitcoin is nothing but a savings account while banks offer dozens of financial services, including loans. 
It's roughly an equal amount of work to open a bank account and register at a bitcoin exchange, except banks offer way more services than a bitcoin account does *and* you typically can't even buy bitcoins without a bank account in the first place. 
I especially don't understand the complaint about having to provide ID. Do people here not understand that the rest of the world is okay with this? How else are you supposed to prove you own the account? Simply knowing the account number or some passphrase isn't really enough when somebody just beats that information out of you. I actually *appreciate* having my identity and picture associated with my bank account. When I lose my debit card I just walk into the bank and get a new one instead of making a whiny post on r/bitcoin about how I was hacked

That's the most foolish idea of all
It's pretty ridiculous to be all "hey guys SHOW ME THE LAW". Nobody is interested in looking up what specific law provides Lawsky the authority to do his job but the Department of Financial Services of New York State has deemed that bitcoin regulations fall under his jurisdiction. If you're really interested in finding out an answer, why don't you tweet Ben Lawsky and ask him what gives him his power? He's fairly active on Twitter and I think he'd get a kick out of the question.

What are you implying here?
Like, I know you're just doing the typical libertarian circle jerk here, but not a single penny of FDIC insured funds have been lost since the FDIC started, and if his local bank is committing some kind of fraud that has literally no effect on his savings account balance...thanks to the FDIC. 
Also, "a lot of work"? How about you explain how an individual with no bank account acquired bitcoins locally in less than an hour? If you don't want to, let's just pretend he has a bank debit card in one hand an some bitcoins in his phone in the other. The bank card lets him spend his money anywhere in town, the bitcoin requires "a lot of work" to convert into a spendable form (gift cards, probably)

Apple wasn't trying to secure and store people's money like Bitcoin businesses are...nothing Apple did has anything to do with money transmitter licenses...
...and where did that $2M figure come from? From Erik Vorhees' recent post? I asked him in that thread for a source and he didn't reply. 
What fees do you think cost $2M? 
It isn't that expensive, but even if it were, I'd rather a company jump through hoops proving they can protect my money rather than have no hoops and pull a Gox - losing money with practically no trace. Same for Bitstamp's recent hack
There's some irony to be seen in Bitcoiners talking about high bank fees while simultaneously complaining about how expensive the regulations banks already follow are
I'd much rather a company have to follow basic regulations than pretend regulations are unimportant and pretend Gox and Stamp never lost money. A system of checks and balances is necessary to protect public money and obviously bitcoin-centric companies aren't very good at regulating themselves thus far
@_date: 2015-04-25 19:20:39

What fees are you referring to specifically? 
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:23:50


So they have to serve all 48 states immediately? If you can't afford to comply with regulations you probably can't afford to be in business and chances are you'll have an issue like Gox or Stamp did and have no fucking idea where your money went


Erik mentioned $2M in fees, now you're talking about bonds, insurance, etc. All of those are separate things. Bonds aren't a fee, and if you think insurance is unnecessary then lol 
Rather than ask "how do I figure?" How about you actually research the applicable fees instead of parroting Mr. Vorhees baseless estimates? 
What's the though process here? Banks are bad because they charge expensive fees. Bitcoin is good because its cheap and theres no regulations, but when a bitcoin company loses your money we're supposed to cut them slack for not having a fucking clue what happened? Because they couldn't afford to pay some fees they apparently can't afford to keep your money safe? And now it's alright that Gox went under and lost dozens of millions of dollars because whoo paying that $2M would have been soooo expensive
Nobody in the general public would be okay with two students, no experience, and no regulations running a bank - so why is it supposed to be okay in the world of Bitcoin? The regulatory fees are high (not $2M) because you're being trusted with much more in actual public money and you're expected to show some accountability when it goes missing. 
How dare we provide a fractional bond before being trusted to hold millions of dollars? What kind of bullshit is that? I just want to take your money and maybe lose it and oh well when that happens at least I didn't have to pay for pesky regulations thanks for your business - Mark
