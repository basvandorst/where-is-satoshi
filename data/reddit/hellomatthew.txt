Thanks for summarizing this better. I'm sure this would be bigger news to the community if I had spent more time explaining this. Perhaps I'll make a more detailed post later today when I get off work.

Thanks, I'll check that out.

Despite owning bitcoins, I think even $600 was steep. Bitcoin will stabilize around $300-400USD and stay there. I would avoid the hive-mind mentality to buy "cheap" coins. Bitcoin will never go above $800 again.

Wow, I can't believe you were able to tip that much to someone. While most of the people on that forum seemed to not care about Bitcoin, you definitely helped convert one person. That kid will remember that half of his computer came from Bitcoin.
Thanks for putting Bitcoin in a positive light. I'd love to see more good feeling threads like this on our subreddit.

To the moon!

I asked a question on that subreddit after I saw this post. Hence the "I might check it out".
My post was stupid (about mining) so I deleted it after I did a little reading.

Wanna tip a poor fella some bitcoins? You're a millionaire right?
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:47:29
I thought vanity addresses were only for hot wallets or getting money sent to you. Why are people not transferring that money to paper wallets anyways?

As a holder of bitcoins, I honestly hope you are correct and I am wrong. I'm going to keep holding till the very end, but I am not as bullish as most of this sub.

Are passwords compromised?
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:47:07
Google, Microsoft, or another tech leader. Despite NSA and data concerns, a backing like that would help get their coin into the mainstream.

I emailed you to reserve an alias. Great idea!!
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:38:59
That is correct. A currency will come out backed by someone with more credibility and it will take the throne. While the technology behind bitcoin is revolutionary, I don't believe bitcoin is the end game. I think it will be dethroned before it has the opportunity to do anything huge.
Bitcoin will always live in infamy as the father of cryptocurrency, but it wont be the future. Hope my opinion makes some sense to you.

Thank you very much!

Of course anyone can mine with compromised computers. Some people utilize large RATed networks for altcoin mining.
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:43:54
True, but I don't think we should get the community worried about this. They would need a LOT of machines for a good hashrate. It would be just as easy to RAT some PCs, and you would get some decent mining power.
Sure this is new, but there are bigger and similar threats. Let's not spook everyone.
Just my two cents. I hope I'm not coming off too argumentative.

Hacking forums around 2010. My roommate and I almost started mining at the time, but got sidetracked by other things. Saw it pop back up around 2011 and though about buying some to use. Again, I second guessed myself.
Years later, I now finally have 1.5 BTC. A little to late, but I hope to use it at some coffee shops in the future.

Never heard of GoldCoin. I might check it out.
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:49:02
I don't want to have to deposit funds here.
I'm both lazy and don't want to spread my coins out too much. :/
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:44:08
Post your address or PM it to me and I'll send you a dollar in BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:27:22
I reserved my address. Again, great idea. I look forward to this being implemented throughout wallets.
