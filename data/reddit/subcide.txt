Easier to quit your job would be the main reason I think.

If someone just dumps it with a market sell, it would just chew through pretty much every buy order in the book, tanking the price.  See the ETH flash crash from a year or two ago.  Worst case with that amount they could straight up suppress the price for a long time if they felt like it. Not sure what they play there would be. Seems it'd be sensible to sell bit by bit over 6 months or so.
@_date: 2018-09-10 13:55:01
No, it's way too early.

That's way better, good job my dude :)

I'm imagining while everyone here is buying lambos, you're sitting in your house marvelling at your 15 couches :)

It'd be hilarious if these were actually made years and years ago as a promotional gimmick, and had private keys stamped on the chocolate or something :D
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:38:45
Cynically, I think maybe the fact that the news maybe isn't hitting China as hard as it's hitting english-speaking countries might have a part to play.

I think you'll find it is.

I withdrew a week before shit hit the fan, and the transfer to a btc wallet took a couple of days.

Nice one :) I would avoid opening with 'decentralised domain name registration' next time, but glad to see people getting out there and discussing it.
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:40:19
OP's right in that the general population don't care about these things, and will need a much more compelling reason to switch though.  
I think that's possible in making payments as easy as humanly possible, by anyone, anywhere.  Bank-like entities will still be necessary though, to give people a sense of security.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:17:57
That was exactly what I thought.  Good content, shame about the headline. (though I'm used to this, as I live in the world.)
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:15:33
I didn't want to post this because I was thinking it would be seriously downvoted, so thank you :) I agree.
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:30:29
I have a whole container full of coins!  I tend to use the £1 coins at the laundry, which I then give to the person behind the counter to get change because the laundry machines only take 20p pieces.  In the past they've given me these coins directly from the dryers themselves after running out of 20p coins in the register.  I'll then inevitably end up only using £1.80 and going home with 2 coins.
What a fucking waste of time for everyone. ;)
@_date: 2014-03-12 10:11:10
Currently my spending is mostly donations or tips (through ChangeTip), but some of my friends use it to pay each other back for various things, so through that I've been to movies, got concert tickets, etc through that.

Well, aren't you a bit of a douche for re-posting it anyway. :P
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:58:42
I'm not surprised that they're not supporting it, I'm surprised that they're actively combatting it though.

For anyone that's saying "Just buy an Android", if getting an Android phone is a requirement for mass adoption of Bitcoin, we're going to get nowhere.
Leave your biases at the door.  Bitcoin needs to be accessible to as many people as possible, and at the moment, people's iPhones provide them more value than Bitcoin does.  They won't switch.
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:25:48
Obviously the things others are suggesting, but also add BTC exchange rates into the google search box calculator functions. ie: "15 BTC in USD"
@_date: 2014-01-30 19:43:23
Probably the least-surprising news I've ever read :)

Sorry for obviousness, but use a different wallet?

The corn lobby will never let Bitcorn gain traction in the market.  They'll push for regulation and our dreams of eating decentralised corn will be reduced to nothing :'(

I didn't vote for you.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:47:15
If you believe in it, spend it on things, and buy back the amount you spend each day/week.  This means you hold the same amount, but it gains traction as a transactional currency.
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:47:40
App.net still exists?  Huh...
@_date: 2014-07-08 14:05:58
NZ is the closest I've seen to a cashless society.  No transaction costs for residents paying by debit card, even for small purchases.  1c &amp; 2c coins phased out in the early 90's, 5c phased out a decade ago.
Living in the UK now, I miss this.
@_date: 2014-10-09 14:55:55
There definitely seemed to be more Bitcoin friendly senators than I expected. Only a few who I think would still suggest silly regulation strategies after that hearing. We will see though. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:03:56
It's kind of scary to think what the internet's reaction to Bitcoin would have been if the white paper was credited to a woman.

Also let's learn from America, and not foster a system where tips are *expected*, rather than being a reward for value given.  Tipping "for lulz" because "wow" doesn't really help much.

This is more likely to slow Russia down than it is to slow Bitcoin down.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:47:34
Not exactly.  It's the community in general that's taking bitcoin down with Gox, by panic-selling, and not informing themselves on the actual problems described in the press release.

My point is  "Bitcoin needs to be accessible to as many people as possible".
Also, your numbers are misleading. (these probably are too, stats are largely bullshit)
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:51:26
I stand corrected :) Thanks.

I like to think there's just one clued up writer in the writer's room, and that all the other writers just think it's a cool-sounding made up future currency :D

I was into BitPay's service a few years ago when it was the slickest experience around, then this year I tried to check my receipts (they email you a link, rather than the details themselves), and all the links are broken.  Fuck you, BitPay.
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:49:09
I think it's fair to say that it should be DD-MM-YYYY and that the US is just incorrect. ;)

So, kill anyone who doesn't convert?  Gotcha.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:26:32
Possibly, though is there a chance they weren't cashed out and just Hodld because it was difficult to cash out?
@_date: 2019-02-02 17:26:17
In that case every crypto is the currency of the internet though, and I don't think that's really what he means.

WeExchange and Bitfunder are also being targeted. Be smart, don't store coins or funds on exchanges.

KYC is there to help prevent fraud amongst other things (corruption, bribery, etc), so it's both.
@_date: 2015-09-07 12:40:59
Touché :)  Though it appears as though many of the large shareholders are also potential scumbags.

I lost 200 gambling on satoshidice, so don't feel bad :)
@_date: 2016-10-11 17:45:13
I thought it was generally if you've failed a kyc check because of whatever reason (non-legal name, address that doesn't match their records).  You're probably right, it's probably just that all kyc check services also do fraud checking.

That may be your opinion, but it's certainly not everyone's.  I believe in bitcoin's transactional value and blockchain transparency over anything else.

I've done 3 transfers from HSBC UK to MtGox and they've all gone through within 24h, usually overnight.  Have had no blocked transfers or anything.
@_date: 2013-06-10 09:28:16
Yeah those transfer fees really suck.  If only someone would come up with a way to transfer money across the internet without fees eh?
Seriously though, if you're getting into Bitcoin as an investment, I would hope you'd be expecting to make a net gain of more than $30.
(I'm in the UK.  Wire transfer is our only real option. Local purchase through BitBargain has stupidly inflated prices, overall way worse than transfer fees.) 
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:04:24
The problem is that there would only ever be 21 million dollars in circulation ever.  The flaw of that 1:1 valuation is obvious to you I hope.
@_date: 2013-08-28 12:03:54
My only request is adding it to the currency conversion in google's calculator/search.
ie: Typing in "100 BTC in USD" and have the converted result show up.
