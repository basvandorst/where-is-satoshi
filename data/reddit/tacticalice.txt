Tried reporting item as a scan and giving it negative review, But it looks like reviews are turned off. So i asked them a question on whats stopping them from scamming buyer.

What happens if the blocks keep signaling it? despite the announcement, could it still activate? Should the community continue to fight beyond the signaling block?

We might already have this some place. I think it would be a good idea to have a visible collective guide created on what wallets can have adjusted fee and how to adjust those fees in that wallet. It would help with all the new people joining and paying these fees. Maybe pinned on here as part of a "how to wallet" post or linked from the .org site? The more we can do to make it user friendly the more it will get adopted.

This is exactly what i had to do for my LTC wallet i rediscovered a few months back. It took me a good couple of weeks to get in the right mind state to figure out my pass code. I would literally just think of my self sitting there in my old computer room, watching my self like a ghost until something clicked. I think went though every range of emotions while trying to figure it out.. until i finally got it!
