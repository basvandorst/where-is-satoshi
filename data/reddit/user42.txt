Anybody else get the actual documentary as a related video? 
@_date: 2016-04-10 11:52:20
It doesn't show anything while I visit

We should bribe him/her with tips!

The one I hear most about is ethereum.  The dash community is pretty excited about the opportunity, as are the rest.  A coin that doesn't have day+ or stuck transactions isn't a hard sell, the alts just don't have build out in the userspace yet to compete on total utility, but they're making progress.
Here's an article on ethereum, you could argue there are some other things at play then just block size between bitcoin and ethereum: 
@_date: 2016-04-03 14:35:12
The difference between median and average is interesting.  Is that being caused by the empty blocks miners push sometimes?  I wonder how much the average would shift if the empty blocks were removed.
@_date: 2016-04-10 13:25:47
This thing is great!  Itd be cool if they fell off the table when they were mined into a block.
@_date: 2018-08-03 23:36:57
Not sure I understand how the article relates to credit card fees?
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:11:01
They might if they get a discount.  Credit cards are expensive to deal with, hopefully crypto can do better.
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:44:50
Stable coins ftw?
@_date: 2018-08-03 23:39:22
I thought they shut that down when fees got high?
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:41:46
Does using LN require I surrender my keys?  E.g. I have to trust the hub operator to act honestly and not get hacked?  Not a big deal for exchanges I guess, since your keys are already in their hands, but for wallets that wouldn't be ideal, if that's the case.
@_date: 2016-03-17 22:02:09
Who controls what code is accepted or rejected?
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:16:58
I thought falling under some of those compliance pieces (especially the ones that require external audits) cost extra. In reading thru it, doesn't appear to be a different price point.  TIL.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:05:50
Actually, if you pay extra.... 
@_date: 2016-03-18 20:54:14
Sure, but how's the process work today? 
@_date: 2016-03-17 22:20:30
You're saying there is a voting process?
@_date: 2016-03-17 23:05:12
So how did the block size question route thru those folks or has it?
@_date: 2016-03-18 17:19:28
Wouldn't sidechains to prevent liquidity shortages have a similar goal?  The block stream white paper on their side chain work, page 4, where they talk about bitcoin's challenges I found an interesting read.  
@_date: 2016-03-18 22:10:32
I had read that.  I would not have guessed decentralized stake-based voting was what you were thinking.  Are you thinking of bitcoins as stake?
@_date: 2016-03-18 02:34:03
If the 7 don't agree and one group moves forward it could cause github chaos if they try to Duke it out?
@_date: 2016-03-18 13:40:02
How do you measure community agreement?
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:30:21
They won't be able to after eth moves to proof of stake.
@_date: 2016-03-17 22:34:50
Huh.  How do I see rejected code and who rejected it?  That'd be interesting.  What is the reconciliation process if maintainers disagree?
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:07:08
Items that require community concurrence are then tabled until such time it is possible to measure agreement?  What's in store in the next few months, sounds exciting!
@_date: 2016-03-18 17:20:19
@_date: 2016-03-17 23:48:20
It sounds like anyone can say no, but everyone has to say yes?
@_date: 2016-03-18 14:56:45
Interesting, so the purpose on the block stream home page is inaccurate/out of date?
@_date: 2016-03-18 01:39:32
Right, but folks on that page have a level of access that others literally do not?
@_date: 2016-03-18 01:04:03
I don't see a Mike on the list of folks with veto power?
@_date: 2016-03-17 22:13:48
Hmm github lists 7 people and the project States the project leader is the release manager.  I don't see where it says who that is.
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:26:29
That's quite the announcement! (At least I hadn't heard that before).  A few months isn't that far off. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:27:15
How can I contribute?
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:38:18
Cool!  So no major merchant partners (yet)?
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:37:14
Transactions require confirmations before the customer is cleared or the TX fee is just checked to be adequate?
@_date: 2018-10-28 11:39:30
If they don't offer you a settlement then the NDA probably isn't enforceable   if you're in the us.  The NDA is so it doesn't get out they're paying settlements on delisted coins.  The NDA can't stop you from taking them to court as far as I know.
Edit: you should ask a lawyer
@_date: 2018-10-26 12:24:50
From your description I'd guess they were going to tell you the delisted coins are gone and offer you a settlement.
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:29:01
Some may contend it's correlated to the recent surge in trade volume and price volitality. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:26:16
What would happen to bitcoins in the Plutus framework in the event of a transaction backlog on bitcoin large enough that anything sent with a normal fee would likely be dropped from the network before it's mined?  Force bigger TX fees?
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:07:52
Seems like a clear cut case of:  unless they offer a settlement, but I am not a lawyer.
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:23:54
Do you have any merchants signed up?
@_date: 2017-07-10 01:05:44
There can be a fork where both chains crash in value.
@_date: 2017-07-10 12:57:00
If you think the sum of the split chains will be less than the current market price then it would make sense to switch to fiat and then buy back in after the split.  It's a tough call in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-07-24 16:25:29
I know the down vote bus is coming after me for saying this, but I think you're mis-understanding how big of a screw up the DAO was/is for the ethereum protocol.  It exposed a *fundamental flaw* in ethereum's ability to run smart contracts in general and especially at greater levels of complexity.  There is a bit of a discussion about it here:   
The flaw is arguably fixable, but its not fixed yet.
@_date: 2016-07-19 23:01:05
You may miss some ...interesting.. trading opportunities

No one needs another gox!

Is there a mixer that does forwarding like that?  Keep in mind the mixer still knows the sender and receiver, you just can't figure it out by looking at the block chain.
