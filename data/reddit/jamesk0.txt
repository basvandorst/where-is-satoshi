But does it blend?

Info on the reorder. We raised some money and donated it to ALS last year, would love to do something similar. Also I guess when I say "we" it pretty much means me and Epix Gear who made the kits and even setup a website last year.

I helped put together a order over at for cycling apparel twice last year, and I know that would probably have much more interest in promoting BTC seeing as it is a bigger community. As far as the mention, really no need to look at it other than it has been done very successfully before. If you aren't a cyclist or runner, then this really doesn't mean anything to you. If you are then this will probably be something very cool.

I haven't, but I wrote everything down correctly. I have used my passphrase in the past before also and it worked. It sounds like it isn't recognizing my passphrase but I am 100% that that is the correct one.

I had the seed and I've run the recovery and still nothing. As soon as the update was completed it showed 0 BTC in my account.

...and you don't have rednecks who watch college football? The sport of NASCAR is all about technology, and the Doge car gained a lot of interest in the NASCAR world.

They were there right before the update and gone right after. Seed could not of been found by anyone else. If they were stolen I would still see my transaction history.
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:22:12
I wrote it down and already used it and it still shows 0 BTC.
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:32:11
This is not the case. Seed is correct, otherwise it wouldn't show up.
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:30:53
the problem is I have used this password in the past, i know it to be correct.
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:08:58
Where do I plug in my passphrase again though? Delete and do the recovery all over again?
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:29:27
Can you share more information on this?
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:52:18
Yes, I had that written down as well and that is correct.
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:25:02
It shows my entire transaction history as nothing after the update.
