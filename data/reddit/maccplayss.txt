If you see a new must have crypto at rock bottom prices you pump money in so with the rush it goes up a lot. Sell it soon after and you have 5000 profit per BCH.

If you say something people want to be real you get upvotes. If you tell the truth and the sub doesn’t agree you get downvotes.

Google black mirror on Netflix. This was their idea in one of the episodes. You didn’t come up with it sorry.
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:37:50
Just do what everyone else in this sub does. Wait to see if it has a few up or downvotes then do the same without even reading it.

Question. Lets use a round figure of 100. If there are 100 bitcoins total and 99 of those are held by wales, what good is it to the public if they dont have any bitcoins to use for adoption?
