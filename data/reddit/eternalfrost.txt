Any numbers on how much of that is in person at places like Las Vegas versus sitting at home online?
At least in my mind, a huge part of the entertainment value associated with gambling is taking a trip to a fancy casino and spending a few nights in a ritzy hotel with live shows and comped drinks and flashing lights and scantily clad women and so on.
In other words, I think most of the fun comes from the non-gambling sideshows that the house edge pays for. Sitting at home in my underwear clicking the mouse to play 0% slots just doesn't sound very fun unless you have gambling problems.

The whole notion of rating the validity of a unit of monetary value because one is more volatile and/or one can make someone quick gains by flipping it is nonsense. 
Gold was a valid method for storing wealth 100s to 1000s of years ago because it was easily verifiable, physically scarce, and easily transferable. 
All of the same desirable attributes, and more, apply to crypto and make them fundamentally valuable. More importantly, crypto extends these fundamental concepts out into a framework that is applicable now and into the future; while standards like gold have already outlived most of their practicality.

The Metro buses all have bike racks on the front. I've never had a problem using them.
Unless it is very far, it is usually faster/easier to just bike directly to the destination though.

Can confirm. I bike 10 miles to work each day in Wisconsin year round. Get some decent snow tires and goggles and your all set.
Sure as fuck beats walking in the snow...

I would be somewhat leery of the Chinese boards. I have fallen into the trap of buying the 'Hong Kong' versions of other basic electronics components off eBay etc. because the are so much cheaper and look the same. In pretty much all cases, they are really shit quality and break within a few weeks or are completely unusable from the start. For example, the last Chinese Arduino I bought had the USB port literally *RUST* out and no longer connect after sitting on a desktop for a few weeks.
Not to mention that there are repeated cases of things like this having rootkits/backdoor firmware shipped with them...
Yeah, its probably a slim chance, but it is usually better to shell out the extra 5 bucks and get a solidly built unit that you can trust.
