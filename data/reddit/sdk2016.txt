It's Refreshing to get such news on this sub.
When you live in a country where Access to Internet is a scarcity in remote towns and villages, you can't help but rejoice over it. 
It's good to notice that this sub is not about weird Bitcoin memes and Gifs alone.

We do have some exchanges in the country. You can easily exchange bitcoins for cash from your home using mobile money account. The exchange that i patronise is the capitale Accra and i live in a town 150 kms afar. i use my mobile phone to transact(buy/sell) with them.
Is it possible to DM you for details of the project? i'm also on Telegram  Thanks

Great to hear from I'm in Ghana (West-Africa). I wanted to start a Bitcoin remittance startup project here in the country in order to provide easy access to international funds transfers to the population. There is a huge part of Ghanaians who are in the diaspora (UK, Germany, USA, China, etc)  that regularly send money to their relatives. To get the funds sent by their relatives, people in remote towns and villages must travel for 10X miles to cities where banks and money transfers companies are based. 
My idea was to use Bitcoin remittance services nationwide even in remote areas. The biggest blockade for the project was the lack of Internet coverage in major parts of the country. 
I'm happy to read about what you're doing  . Maybe it may be a solution for the project...
The potentials of Bitcoin in developing countries are huge.  many have not got it yet. Most bitcoiners are just holding some coins for future ROI instead of using this amazing technology to solve problems in the world.
