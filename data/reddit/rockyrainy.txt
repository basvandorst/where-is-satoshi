You are telling me Coinbase is pay every individual transactions? Jesus Christ, they need to hire better tech people with all that money coming in.

No disagreeing, but just because this is a bubble doesn't mean the technology itself is not transformative. Bitcoin lost 80% of its value between 2013 - 2014. But that didn't stop the technological progress. From the ashes rose a new generation of alts, Ethereum, Monero each does something that has not been done before. The central bankers are scared. If I lose my money taking them down, I'd still consider it a net win.

On the long run, this is good for Bitcoin because it reduces the outsized influence Jihan has on mining thereby increases the diversity in the mining ecosystem.
Think about it this way, if everybody runs Antminers, a single exploit could subvert a big chunk of the hashpower potentially opening the door for a 51% attack. Where as if there are 10 different mining hardware, a vulnerability in one can only take out a small portion of the total hash power.

We are an open Network. Bitcoin is put under the test every second of every day. There are billions up for grabs if someone can figure out how. The reason it hasn't is because of the resilience of the code and the iron laws of mathematics. 
If the banks short, I will buy. If they manipulate the exchanges to short sell our balances, we can transfer to private wallets. Join us brother as we take on the prime evils of humanity.

Beautifully said. What is Bitcoin is good for Crypto. 
I hodl Bitcoin and I own the alts. The zero sum thinking in the alt space is extremely counter productive. For any coin to replace any other coin is just us nerds eating each other's lunch. When the entire space is only $200 Billion, that's not a lot of food on the table. Compare that with mass adoption. If crypto increases to $1 trillion, Bitcoin triples to 500 Billion and the other 500 goes to the alts. Even if 1 Billion flows into one of their coins, they'd still be a rich man. 
 The only way we can make real significant gains in this space is

It is a moronic argument. It is like saying Obama could also be a watch maker. Technically he could be, but then he wouldn't be the 44th president would he?
Bitcoin needs Lightning because it is the logical tier 2 scaling solution. People want bitcoin to be bitcoin. That means high degree of censorship resistance with small blocks, 10 minutes hash time, and a PoW that burned as much electricity as Denmark. If you want all that simplicity on the base layer, you got nowhere to build but up.

This incident proves that the protocol is solid. But the client needs more work.
As a fellow software engineer, I'll take solid protocol with shitty client over shitty protocol with solid client any day of the week. The reason being, clients can always be rewritten, protocol changes will require a hard fork (possible reboot) of the network.

There are plenty of asic resistant algorithms such as equihash and cryptonight. Asics are not magic, they don't work so well once your algorthem requires more then a megabyte of memory.

I always wondered if Satoshi is really an acronym for the people behind it.

I get it, crypto is different from cryptocurrency. I am on mobile so typing the whole thing takes too long. Technically blockchain doesn't cover all cryptocurrencies. IOTA uses DAG, I suspect more coins will follow in its foot steps. Personally I just sick of getting fucked over by the financial system. The financial crisis of 08 took a lot out of me. And I have no intention of repeating that. BTC specifically is the biggest brand of crypto by far. I want BTC to succeed so that cryto as a whole can succeed. I hope for a future where fiat currencies will be benchmarked along side crypto currencies. Say if the Fed decides to lower interest rates, the USD will drop against a basket of crypto indexes and there will be pressure on the financial elites that are messing with the money supply.
