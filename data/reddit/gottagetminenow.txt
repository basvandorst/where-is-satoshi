I agree but this is a chicken and the egg problem. People don’t want to use an exchange that doesn’t have liquidity and you don’t get liquidity unless people start using the exchange. So it’s going to take time and a really good exchange with speed and some good marketing.

I'm more curious about the potential long term goals miners have in regards to keeping the idea of a hard fork occurring floating out there.
I remember reading somewhere about this and the basic idea was to suppress price.  The longer they suppress price, the longer they can continue to mine and keep or grow their share of the hash rate.
If, for example, there was more agreement on the path forward then price of bitcoin would more be likely to go up at a faster rate because there would be little concern for the possibility of a continuous hard fork.  Once bitcoin really gets going, and gets the attention of more powerful entities then they would be more inclined to join in on mining.  I think the current miners feel threatened by a bigger, more powerful group overtaking them in terms of mining power and thus want to stay in the game as long as possible and preserve their power ($$$).

This sounds like someone complaining they don't understand tcp/ip.  There will be a day when you have no idea what is going on underneath you, but it just works. This is a brand new thing, yes, even after 10+ years of bitcoin's existence.  LN autopilot will get better, channels will automatically balance, you will open channels automatically that are dual funded, and you will have a backup of your channels in case your node blows up.
For example, my parents should not own bitcoin or transact with it at this point in time, but soon they will be able to use it just like BILLIONS are now using the internet.
FFS, I remember dialing into BBS with a 2400 baud modem, it was a pain in the ass, slow, and worked less than half the time. 99% of the world did not have patience to do this, and rightfully so, but it got faster, and easier over time.

If someone like you, who doesn't understand what is happening, you have two choices: 1. take some time and teach yourself, or 2: wait.

@_date: 2019-10-08 09:18:34
Sure, but you are assuming that there are no inflation bugs in the code.  We already saw one in bitcoin core. Fortunately, it wasn't exploited, but if it was, the older nodes would see it as invalid, and since all tx are public it would be fairly easy to spot.  Not the case if the txs are confidential.

Who cares if the pump came from an exchange in Korea that has zero trading fees, why would Roger sell his BTC for Korean Won??? The only reason to manipulate the Korean exchanges, which is easy if you don't have to pay any fees to trade, is to push the price up on the other exchanges.
The fact is that he moved his coins to Bitfinex where he could directly trade his BTC for Bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:44:35

Just to clarify, if you lose your node for whatever reason you will need this file stored on a separate drive, and/or remotely.
It will NOT restore your channels, it will only allow you to force close your channels once you have a new lnd node setup, with your previous seed phrase and recover any funds in channels.
You will have to open new channels once you fully recover your funds.

So in order to convince the miners to switch to the BIP148 bitcoin you are also going to need the exchanges, correct?  The exchanges will have to have both coins listed and the one with the most value will most likely win. The user will vote with their wallets ($$$) by buying their preferred coin and selling the other.
How is this different from a contentious hard fork? Two chains, a fight over hash rate, and competing price of each coin.  It still comes down to the miners choosing a side that is most advantageous for them.
I'm not convinced this will work.

In terms of the blocksize, I think right now it is important to get wallets and exchanges using bech32 to minimize tx sizes.
Once bech32 has been widely adopted and used, then move on to things like schnorr sig to again minimize tx size.
Also, getting exchanges/wallets/businesses/etc to accept LN would be helpful as well, and Liquid mainly for exchange to exchange transfers.
LN is not ready for mass adoption imo right at this moment.  LND 0.6 will have channel backups and I believe watchtowers.  Some additional UX/UI improvements will make it more ready for mass adoption.  The improvements over the last year or so have been staggering, so I'm confident it will be ready for bitcoin normies this year. Not sure if/when it will be grandma safe.
Once those and any other realistic tech has been used to reduce tx size, then maybe an actual blocksize increase could be considered if there is a realistic need for it.
The issue of course is that this would be a hardfork, and it is difficult to get the vast majority of nodes to update.  Just look at the inflation bug, there as still 1000 or so public nodes running this vulnerable software 6 months after it was patched.
My personal feeling is that it is important that you can run a full bitcoin node on an rpi or old laptop, I don't want to see bitcoin end up like ethereum where you need a $20k computer to run a full archival node.
