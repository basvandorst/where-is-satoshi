I live in Bloomington, 2 minutes from Normal. There is actually no btc community here. I have tried to get people interested, but, corn is more interesting here. There is one guy on localbitcoins and the closest mycelium seller is 75 miles away. The pantagraph (pantywaste) is our local, basically worthless, newspaper. I'm not in the same age group as this guy, and i have never heard of him either. It did not make the news when he was arrested. 
This sucks because i was close to getting a couple of business to join bitpay ( there are no places to spend btc here, unless you count some home medical supply store that actually doesn't have a brick store).

I'm not sure, but if it means cheaper booze for one person and not another, I'm sure it is illegal. That being said, when I went to pay for my car license tax, they wanted to charge me an extra 3.5% if i used my debit card, so I had to write a check (wtf is a check?).

They are out to make vendors' have a difficult time, make customers irritated and collect fines. If there is a loophole, they will just squash you with a fine and let you fight it in court. Here is an example. My local watering hole had a program called "Wednesday Warrior." Once you visit the establishment 10 Wednesdays in a calendar year, you got upgraded to "Wednesday Warrior." The perks were small, but nice... a free tshirt and instead of getting your beers in 16 oz pint glasses, you were served in 20oz imperial pints for the same price. Once the state got word of this, they crushed the program with $500 daily fines and made them stop giving "discounts" on 20oz glasses. They still do their WW thing, but instead of getting cheaper booze, they give you 10% of food. I haven't been back since then.

There really is no price fixing, bars charge whatever they want for their drinks. There may be minimums in place because places used to run 25 cent 6oz beer specials (shitty beer), but I haven't seen that in ages.
I suppose there could be grounds for a legal challenge by obtaining a 2nd liquor license and only accepting Bitcoin, but I suspect that the local muni would not approve of an additional liquor license... just, ya know, because they can.
