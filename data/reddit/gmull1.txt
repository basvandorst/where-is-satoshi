People were interested. Ifs a large part of the principles the country was found on and people believe in those. They were never fully realized in large part because of the powerful in government and now the central banks controlling the creation and flow of money to enrich themselves. Normal People have always been held back because of their race, colour, social status etc. bitcoin is a natural network and it doesn't care. All the worlds people with a few bob to run together should stake a small claim before the 1% really start buying.

The elite are only getting interested now and 17mill of the 21 has already been mined and is in the hands of ever day Joe's. Those big wallets are mostly owned by very early adopters made up again of everyday joes from coding and cryptography community and the likes. Its is going to be the biggest transfere of wealth and changing of the guard since the last industrial revolution.

I'm sure attempts will be made, all the more reason to HODL. Hodlers of last resort will do very well.

I think they realize that Libre will ultimate mean they lose control to a super powerful elite. With Bitcoin everyone gets a fair crack at the whip, its more in line with true capitalism and open markets along and the declaration of independence. It will also be adopted and disrupt at a pace they can adjust to. Libre will be hugely disruptive practically over night. Better the devil you know.

They are for the most part normal working people, certainly nothing like the elite in power today. They also adopted it like most others from a view of supporting a more inclusive fair and predictable version of money. The elite havent made any real attempts yet at stopping it because it hast popped up on their radar. Only now is it starting to gain the attention of the establishment and we are still a while of them truly realizing what's a foot and trying to do something about it.

No they dont, most of the elite have been asleep at the wheel. There are big players yes but very few of them are the fiat worlds elite. Regardless take my situation for example. In the fiat world I'm a working man on less than the national average wage, just of the bottom rung of the ladder. In the bitcoin world I have several which percentage wise is a significant bigger position than where I sit in Fiat. Should it transpire that it grows to its full potential I may end up well up the ladder from today. There is still time for people to stake a position that could change their lives. Its not gonna fix all the issues but it's the best option available and prob a once in a several generation opportunity.
@_date: 2019-07-24 06:15:04
In that case id like to raise a toast to the elite for manipulating it up, thank you from me.
@_date: 2019-10-13 07:35:00
The difference this time may be the 0 and -0 interest rates around the globe. Also there is a high chance of currency crisis occurring and a major loss in confidence in Fiat across the board. It's a whole new world of mismanagement, incompetence and unethical practices. Gold and Bitcoin seem to be well positioned on the right side of the trench but who knows.

It's just a hassle trying to keep track and report it all correctly. Might have to move to Auz where its classed as currency rather than property so there is no capital gains tax. Or I'll wait till it's up enough to do one large exchange. Good on you though mate.

For Bitcoin to become a good medium of exchange it first needs to prove itself as a good store of value. Most of us know it is but it is not us that need convincing. Nothing will stop the price going up over the long term, the economics of it and the nature of people I believe absolutely ensures that. As that occurs an increasing  number of everyday people gain confidence in it and will choose use it as savings. When mass adoption of that practice occurs it will organically become the medium of exchange we all want to see. 
It is all playing out perfectly, lower your time preference and be patient.
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:58:18
Ain't that the truth. It wont stay that way though.

 Brillant! Lol
@_date: 2019-02-07 07:44:11
I must be missing something.
Federal insurance, role backs, ra ra ra. We have the most secure network ever created so we dont need any of that.
As for ease of use it couldnt be any easier, pop your nano in copy paste the address and hit send or receive!. 
I'm far from tech savvy and its piss easy for me but hey I can also wipe my own arse and tie my own shoes.

It's not the first mover there were several attempts at digital currency going back decades. Bitcoin is the one doing it better, the one thing it absolutely must get right and is doing so is security. It's the largest most secure network ever created period.
The miners get plenty of incentive regardless of the price as the cost to mine a block adapts with the market making it so. 
Lighting is and will scale bitcoin beyond anything the centralized systems can do. Just look at how fast its is developing, its incredible.
There are plenty of early signs around the world of unrest and in some countries revolution aimed at the corrupt banking cartel and old world money. Both Fiat money and Kensyen economics are a utterly failed experiment for most. Bitcoin stands as a safe fairer and ethical alternative.
Without all that just the utility of an imunntable ledger to the people of the world alone is priceless.
It's very very early days.
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:23:04
Yes but the benefits to encouraging use are something not present in the traditional finance model. Eg as a retailer using it rather than credit card etc the money is there in your account straight away, there are no bank fees which is further reason to run a node and charge little to no fees . Also if Bitcoin continues to grown in value unlike fiat which over time depreciates that again is more incentive. It is self perpetrating.
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:10:23
Correct in the early days it could have been attacked, flying under the radar helped along with the calibur of the people involved.
Bitcoins price is economical you can buy as much or as little as you want the market through the free trade bitcoin provides will determine its value as it gets adopted and start to be used, which is still a way off. At the moment it's mostly valued on speculation along with supply and demand. 
Adoption will and is occurring first in 2nd and 3rd world countries where it is needed most.
Both transactions and hash rate have grown considerably this past year despite the value dropping and the mining is more decentralized than ever. Showing it's a robust adaptive system thats functions well in bear markets. 
The world is most certainly not working fine. I'm not delving further in to that subject because at this point if you are not aware then its futile.
Regarding the ledger If you think the worlds only immuntable ledger will only be used for finance then you fail to see the potential for the bitcoin network beyond a currency. However as a currency it has the potential to completely disrupt the accounting world just for starters. It wont be long until an app pays all tax on even the smallest of daily trades for businesses at the point of sale and settles on the ledger in bulk at the end of the week or month. I know that would save me a shit load of time and money.
The system has and is always upgrading to protect both the purchaser and seller infact it's so good you wont need insurance which is another thing it will disrupt.
As for people knowing your purchase history they are developing privacy options and in time that wont be an issue. In saying that for most types of tranactions and for most people it already isn't as they are use to the current system tracking every move they make. 
The modern world was built for the most part in the late 20th century and early 21st on the gold standard. Since moving from that we have progressed much slower to the point now things are grinding to a halt. There is countless records of countries, empires, communities throughout history that fell apart and ended when they devalued their currency. The Romans being a significant one. 
People the world over need and deserve hard money that's not owned and controlled by an elite cartel. My comment stands, Kensyen economics and fiat money are failed experiments nearing the end of there life. 
You could read the bitcoin standard for an alternative point of view. I think the author sums it up well. 
They cant stop it now, I think it will become the peoples currency which will eventually lead to the worlds currency over the next  50 to 100 years and all the people of the world will be significantly better for it rather than a small portion at the top in certain countries. Sadly there will be blood and and tears along the way.

I didnt get that when I read it. To me he clearly and rightly pointed out how utter flawed Kensyen economics is and how unqualified he was in the first place.

Yep, �� there will also be no need for accountants and tax returns as they will be settle at the point of sale. Imagine how efficient that will make things for business owners. It will absolutely change the world.

Seems to me Bitcoins immuetablilty is something no other alt coin has or will ever have. It grew in the background for the most part unnoticed and now the horse has bolted. It will probably become the worlds settlement layer for just about anything of value that requires immuetable storage. Im sure plenty of the features others are working on will be developed and added to bitcoin in time. It is and I think it will remain the world largest most secure network and the only immuetable ledger. The utility in that one characteristic in the years to come will be worth more to our species than most can imagine. 
@_date: 2019-05-08 10:26:18

Exactly, Bitcoin grew under the radar into a behemoth and now the horse has bolted. Its is the largest most secure network ever created and likely that ever will be. In time its creation will go down as one of the pivotal moments in Human history.
