I'm against forced labeling on principle, but that's another story. 
Practically, the labeling perpetuates falsehoods about GMO among the ignorant. They'll see the label and think "This is healthier than the GMO alternative", which is not true.

This right here is what this thread's circle jerk is missing. It's correct that the EU can't control bitcoin. HOWEVER, what they can do is make it illegal for businesses to use which hampers it's adoption greatly. 
It's like with anti-gunners. Since they can't get guns banned outright, they push for "death by 1,000 cuts" laws that make it harder and harder to be a lawful gun owner.

Yes and no. By itself you're right. But few with a business to run would use currency that fluctuates like that. Suppliers typically give businesses things like 30 day term. So by the time the customer pays to when the vendor is paid you could have huge swings. That's not feasible.

DevOps manager chiming in. No, they can't. It is totally dependent on your infrastructure and if it's meant to scale like this. Some back ends are built to simply spin up VMs to churn through data, others are more complex and limited by legacy code, secondary systems, etc.

Thank you! Some of these comments look like they're written by newbie devs. Saying you can throw more devs at it is like saying you can have a baby in 1 month if you throw 9 women at the problem.
