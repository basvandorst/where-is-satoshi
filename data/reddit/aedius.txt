Excited for more and more places in Cambridge accepting bitcoin. I live in Central Square and walk by Moksa all the time.

This is quite ironic given how much the Ruble (Russian currency) has gotten crushed relative to the US Dollar. 
The Ruble has lost about half it's value against the US Dollar in the past year.

There has been a lot of talk about moving away from the current proof of work system, as ASIC technology is having a 'centralizing' effect on the network by giving those with access to said technology a massive advantage over those who do not.
It is in the best interest of Bitcoin to move away from the current system.

This is great news. Imagine if some of the larger EDM artists like Tiesto, Armin Van Buuren, and Avicii also start accepting bitcoins as payment.

That's comforting given how terrible facebook has been doing since he left (related or not).

Damn bubble is such a popular word these days...
Investing in AsicMiner shares is betting on the future success of bitcoin. If Bitcoin is successful, transaction fees will likely outweigh actual new bitcoin production in mined blocks after block halving occurs (possible in 2016, but more likely in subsequent block halving years). 
This will sustain the Bitcoin economy and investments made into mining companies like AsicMiner, and could lead to a higher valuation depending on how much traction Bitcoin gains in the global economy.
People often seem to misunderstand AsicMiner and mining investments in general. You do not forgo the value paid for your share(s) in exchange for future dividend payments; ie. you still retain said value (which for AsicMiner will fluctuate based on dividends, percentage of network hash rate, future bitcoins/transaction fees earned per block, etc.)

Surprised this has so few upvotes, this is very big news for circle and Bitcoin. Expanding the breadth of Bitcoin and getting the major retailers looking at it is very important for the growth and ultimate success of Bitcoin. 
Michele Burns is currently a board member at Goldman Sachs and Cisco and a former board member of Wal-Mart. 
She has much more influence than many of the 'big' names in Bitcoin and her experience covers three critical areas that are incredibly important to understanding and growing Bitcoin: Banking, Technology, and Retail.

Awesome! I'll have to try spending some BTC at Thelonious Monkfish! Hopefully more places in Boston are willing to accept BTC

Something I'm unsure of as well. I currently believe that bitcoins (as an investment) will be taxed at your current tax bracket level, unless you are holding for over a year, which would reduce your tax liability.

Not sure why people are downvoting. Here is Dan Kaminsky's take on the situation: 
Gavin posted on reddit recently stating that it will 99% not change this year though.

You know it's bad when you're a shareholder yourself and you're still annoyed at the weekly posts. This is why there is a thread on bitcointalk for all shareholders to discuss the company, share price, dividends, etc..

This is not true. This is a fantastic chart but does not incorporate the other ASIC manufacturers (Avalon, ASICMiner, and any other new ones) so the worst case scenario here is likely much worse than what is displayed in the spreadsheet.

They even got a quote from iron man! 
Customer Tony Stark, 34, had a different take. "I think it is a bit much," Stark said. "lt is inappropriate. In here it is a bit too easy for people to be spontaneous."

This is awesome. Hopefully this will spur more adoption of Bitcoin by small businesses, which will in turn lead to larger companies adopting the technology.

Very interesting  presentation!
