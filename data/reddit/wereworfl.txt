I can’t tell if this is a misunderstanding of what immutable means, a passive aggressive ETC shill, or what

Anytime I see something on Reddit I don’t understand, I just assume it’s the start of an IASIP joke and that this is my cue to feel mildly amused as terrible people make poor life decisions

I think vegan food is a curious comparison, because while vegan food is good for the planet, Bitcoin is not.

The opposite of communism is the most cost-inefficient healthcare system among industrialized nations*
Fixed that for you, even though invoking Soviet famine is sort of the Godwin’s Law of economic debate

You mean versus a corporation that lobbies, cuts corners, and manipulates to get its customer’s business? 
I’m sorry, not all businesses are virtuous, just as not all bureaucracies are bloated and inefficient

I'm 100%, absolutely certain that none of the claims in this impressive wall of text (I counted at least two dozen) would fall apart if examined on their own, so I'm just going to let them be. Definitely not a proof by verbosity.
I'm also surprised that our world's nefarious shadow rulers have made no attempt to assassinate this valiant truth-exposer... think of how much easier their lives would be if he were silenced.
Sarcasm aside (and I thank you for taking the time to respond), you'd think that the people with a site named "Prison Planet" would be more freaked out about a president trying to build a wall along the southern border. I don't think  is trying to keep illegal immigrants out -- he's trying to keep us in.

How come you’re not dispensing these level-headed platitudes of moderation to the far-right opinionists in this thread?
I love that the best response to capitalism’s biggest flaw is “look, it’s not perfect, okay? I know your medications cost more than your rent, but be more balanced in your outlook, you’re so emotional geez”
“And work harder, this was probably your fault anyways”

A “Bolshevik Revolution beginning to happen in America”? 
Your team has controlled all three branches of the US government for the last two years, what brand of paint are you huffing?

Honey, it had its current problems well before the ACA.

They publish:
- conspiracy theories
- fake news
- the stories of other news outlets without permission
... so I don't think we're going to agree that Infowars does some pretty great journalism. A mainstream media outlet would have had the common sense not to let Ver on in the first place.
Ver was on a fringe news show because he is a fringe person.
