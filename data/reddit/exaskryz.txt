Is there a bias against old addresses? There are transactions that are minutes old, paid a 0.0005 BTC fee, and started getting confirmations. I'm at many hours old on two transactions, one with a fee of 0.000129 BTC (which is a little low, that's fine for it to take a while), but another transaction with a fee 0.0005 BTC, and they both don't have any confirmations! The only thing I can think is my addresses are years old, so they're waaaaayyy down the blockchain. No idea if me letting my wallets sit on a broken down PC has hurt me.
What is going on? I thought if you paid more in a fee, you got confirmed faster. The longer this takes, the less I can cash out on my BTC.... And I still have 0.08 BTC to move. I'm ultimately trying to find the fee that isn't going to be me pissing away money, but also won't take days to be confirmed.
I'm tempted to just do a 0.002 fee, 4x the going prices, just to get this confirmed. It's kind of ridiculous it'd be that expensive though.
Look at these transactions: 3 hours ago, they got 6+ confirmations. And I paid just as much or more of a fee than they did!
  
For what reason would my transactions not be completed?
Is there any harm in sharing my transactions? I can think of only being able to tie addresses or wallets to me. But anyhow, my transactions are smaller in the bitcoins traded, but still use only 1 input to 2 output (one being target address, other being change address). So it's not like I am asking for a few kilobyte here. Only 258 bytes per transaction.

I'd love to keep it like, you know, 2-3 hours just to know it worked and be done with this.
This transaction from just a few minutes ago has 1/6 confirmations and has less of a fee than I've paid on my second attempt that is still 0/6 5 hours later...
So weird. Are old addresses discriminated against?
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:40:40
**Why would my transaction disappear????**
What the hell is going on?
I did a transfer of like $5 from my Electrum Wallet into my Coinbase wallet. If I click on the "Details" button on this *PENDING* transaction on Coinbase, I'm brought to Blockcypher and it says it cannot find a transaction by that hash!
What the hell??????
How do I get my money to coinbase??
I have a second transaction that is $35 waiting to get onto coinbase, and it's been 14 hours, still 0/6 confirmations. The first transaction was done 24 hours ago and disappeared???
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:18:06
I'll get to them in the morning; it's 3am here.
I'm doing a test of sending from Electrum to Electrum - one address to another in the same wallet. I put up a $7 mining fee just to see if anyone wants to confirm it. If no one does, something is screwed up.
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:05:03
I got those emails. The emails say I have the money, pending ≥6 confirmations.
But I am still at 0/6 confirmations 24 hours later and 14 hours later on the first and second transaction respectively.
I did find the first transaction on Blockchain.info though; got that link by using Electrum and right-click-&gt;details.
Still weird Blockcypher would erase all trace of my transaction. And still worries me.

I bought Bitcoin many years ago, when the price was around $1000 USD/BC. I'm trying to just sell out of it because I haven't had a use for bitcoin - never seen a retailer I go to accept it, and I only have wallets on my PC, not on mobile anyway. I hadn't done it sooner because the PC I had wallets on basically died and I had to do recovery to get some of them out; luckily the wallet with the bulk of my coins (I think) was recoverable; not sure about my other wallets.
Anyhow, what is the typical fee for getting a transaction done nowadays? I sent a transaction with a fee of 0.000129 BTC (or 0.129 mBTC) last night. The transaction is still pending.
Was my fee *way* too low that no one is going to verify it?
Or is it this other issue: My wallet client, Electrum, is glitchy (has runtime DLL errors) and has been stuck in "Synchronizing" for over 8 hours now. And opening the same wallet results in two wallets: one in [watch-only] mode where I can see my transactions, and the other where no transactions are listed but I was able to send a transaction from it.
Edit: Should mention I'm on Electrum 2.6.1; 1.9.5 as a client launches and syncs just fine, but I'm not allowed to make transactions on that. Electrum 3.0.0 is bugged because I don't have a python35.dll or whatever. Then Electrum 2.9.3 also does not want to run.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:37:25
Update: The Electrum to Electrum test worked. It only took 7 minutes for it to be confirmed; unfortunately I had headed to bed just then.
(tagging in case he wants the update.)
10 minutes later, my second transaction that had been stalling with a fee of 0.0005 got transferred. No idea if getting one confirmed transaction on my wallet suddenly made the algorithm decide my previous transactions were probably valid or what was going on. Could've been pure coincidence had I just waited 10 minutes longer. I doubt it for some reason.
My first transaction is still unconfirmed; I expect it to stay that way for quite some time. And since it's just 0.0005 bitcoin in and of itself (not the fee), if it cancels I'll just hold onto it indefinitely.
I did have a misunderstanding on how blockcypher works though. It now relisted my 20.5 hour old transaction as only being 6 hours old. That was when the confirmation happened. So it wasn't creation age, but "last status update" age. That's why all these newly published transactions on the blockchain were so young - they just had their first confirmations.
Unfortuantely, I've possibly screwed up because my final transaction of a fee of 0.001 is marked as low priority for miners... The size of the transaction is 1100 bytes, not the 260 I had been dabbling with in these experiments. So I effectively gave myself like a fee of 0.0002 and now need to wait probably a couple days for this transaction to get completed.
At least I know my wallet software isn't broken.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:16:22
They did. It was super odd with the timing too, but all of them got resolved. 4 transactions total, made hours apart. The newest one got confirmed minutes before a previous transaction. That is, with transactions A B C and D, as soon as C was confirmed, B was. As soon as D was confirmed, A was. In fact, looking at Electrum time stamps, from C-&gt;B it was a 10 minute wait; from D-&gt;A it was the exact same minute.
Now I just need to possibly wrack my brain on the other wallet passwords I have, and get their newest clients...
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:44:12
Yeah, I'm aware you need multiple. I'm still at 0 confirmations according to the details on the transaction. So I'm wondering if I put myself at the back of an ever-growing queue and people are jumping ahead of me with their higher fees.
Edit: I'm viewing BlockCypher through a Coinbase link onto the details of the transaction. I've got a 85.65% Confidence but a Miner Preference of Low...
Ultimately, I'd be happy to send the rest of my coins in another transaction if I know how much the going fee is. I only transfered 0.0005 BTC (~$3.50) in this test transaction. I Would've thought the 0.000129 BTC being nearly $1 would be good, but I guess not. (It used to be pennies or even less when I first bought into BTC; we were taking μBTC, not mBTC.)
Edit 2: Ah ha, here's some info:
This tells me fees of like 0.00043818 BTC are considered HIGH priority. Since I did a 0.000129 BTC fee, I'm like 3/10ths of a going-rate high priority fee. I'll read up more on that because it talks about a rate per kilobyte.
|High Priority (1-2 blocks) 	|Medium Priority (3-6 blocks) 	|Low Priority (7+ blocks)|
|0.00241 BTC/KB|0.0022 BTC/KB|0.0015 BTC/KB |
Edit 3: The tooltip for the info over High Priority says somewhere between 0.0006-0.00241 BTC per transaction. The example I had above is still below that range and got HIGH priority, but I'll probably try a transaction of around 0.001 fee. See how quickly that gets processed.
Edit 4: My client warned me the 0.001 fee was unusually high, so I figured I'd try a 0.0005. That should at least get me medium priority; and it even exceeds the example above that got high priority.

That's crazy if true, considering my addresses are at least 3 years of age.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:42:42
Fuck you (gently). I wanted to buy $50 worth at $650.
Once I saw it climbed, I've bought $10 at about $780 just in case it doesn't come too far down again. Then it's jumped from $815ish and down again at $750 and back to $780 at this moment. Yay.

And how many people in the federal reserve do you know? Sure, you might get a name or even contact info, but you don't know them. You don't know their agendas.

A good amount of my BTC has come from me *not* putting in fiat money. I've received it from other people. Sure, they may have bought theirs with fiat, but some of this was just for mining and was thus without a fee.
Once that TV store (or if you're buying it used) turns around and spends their BTC, they really didn't have that 1% fee.
Edit: Check out this scenario. It's an exact same deal. You're going to Europe, or America, whichever is foreign to you. You go to a currency exchange. They impose a fee to convert your Euro &lt;-&gt; USD. That's no different than USD &lt;-&gt; BTC. (And even if you used a USD credit card in Europe, your CC company will charge a conversion fee to process your USD and give the store you shopped at their native currency.)

I am getting an error as well, hopping into check emails.
Edit: No luck on an e-mail. Not sure if I got registered. I attempted to sign in and nothing happened. I closed the large registration page. Suddenly Cycle started up and brought me to the apps page (home page/initial startup page?). No registration e-mail ever arrived.

You might be able to use a file recovery software (is it not still in the recycling bin as you said?). Don't do anything else but install the software you do find and run it. Anything else, saving any other files, may overwrite the deleted wallet. I'll look for something I used recently that might do it for you. In the meantime, go find a USB drive to download the file to.
Edit: 
I have used this software before. It works as much as can be expected. The longer a file has been deleted, the harder it is to recover. The fuller your HDD, the harder files will be to recover.

I just did this today. Had a buy pending from a few days ago, bought some more when it was low (but now it seems to have settled lower, oh well. Not big investments.)

Do all of the exchanges require scans of government ID? It's not the easiest thing for me to do with lack of a camera (bar grainy dumbphone and built-in webcame) and scanner.

Can you help explain that bit to me? I've heard Mt. Gox is bad for getting USD from. So are they bad as a broker, but good as an exchange? How do I end up getting USD when I do finally cash out? How can I move any coins from coinbase to an exchange?
But ultimately: I intend to just do the holding game, so should I worry whatsoever? In case of paranoia of coinbase going rogue, do I eat the loss on transfer fees to send to (and later from) a multibit wallet, or is there an alternative?

If you have a keen interest in the browser, I would recommend autohotkey to let you keep that functionality. A quick script I would hash up
    SetTitleMatchMode, 2  
     - Cycle  
    XButton1::Send !{Left}  
    XButton2::Send !{Right}
You can use autohotkey's tools to detect the exact name of your extra mouse buttons. The ! means "Alt". The shortcut command given by hovering over the back/forward buttons in browser is "Alt+Left" and "Alt+Right". Hope this may help you!
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:46:50
I goofed. I tested it out to make sure it was working right, and it wasn't. So I corrected the script. Here it is again for convenience:
    SetTitleMatchMode, 2  
     - Cycle  
    XButton1::Send !{Left}  
    XButton2::Send !{Right}

I can't be sure BTC could ever be a dominant currency. It's got a lifespan. While finances today can be transferred in the event of a person's death, BTC really can't without taking prior measures to ensure a will passes on to someone to let them access your funds.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:00:41
Ashes. (Or Reds, but I'm partial to Ashes as a more common term.)
The name of the developer of the Pokemon games is Satoshi as well - Satoshi Tajiri. The protagonist of the main Anime based on the games was named after him. In English, that protagonist was named Ash. So that's my connection.

I delayed buying with the hope it'd reach back down to the 500s. It never did. It stayed above 600, and even reached up to 780. I bought in, only $20 worth, at 720. Still hoping for a drop sometime here to invest more into.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:53:35
I waited half an hour to buy in. $100 lower. Whoooish.
Now I hope the value jumps up a lot. I've lost $15 on investing so far, hehe. Let's hit that February $2500!

I only recently got involved. I was curious about getting BTC back in 2011. There was something posted to reddit. Coinbase didn't exist. The recommended way to get coins was through someone locally. (I didn't want to put that much effort into it, and drive an hour to find someone that did have some BTC.) Otherwise paypal and trust. (I didn't have either of those.)

Newb here, and searching just brought me to a wiki saying it's password protected. So, what happens is you take a private key, run it through software with a passphrase (seed) to generate a reversible second level private key that will generate the first primary key when the correct password is entered?
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:27:35
It's simply a misunderstanding and lack of clarity. The transaction fee is about in-network, as you understand. 


The first problem is probably "exchanged" is the wrong term. But if it were "transferred", that carries the correct connotation. I distinctly note a lack of fiat (USD, GBP, the physical currencies we've come to know) currency being mentioned in that statement. So I always interpreted as BTC is the only currency involved in that statement, which is true, but I can see how people wouldn't understand that.
The network transaction fee is something like 0.0001 BTC for every KB of data being transferred. When you have BTC worth $1000, that's 10 cents. How do you determine the KB of the transfer? I don't know on coinbase or anything. But there's a formula the network follows. It considers inputs and outputs. Inputs are how many times money was deposited into your address. Outputs are the number of addresses in your wallet that you have to use to make the payment you want.
As an example, I had 5 inputs from faucets. I wanted to transfer to my offline wallet. That would've cost me Twice the transaction fee (0.0001*2=0.0002) and that was when BTC were $800. So I'd have paid 16 cents. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:18:11
How do you set up a limit order? Is this something that can be done on coinbase?

I haven't watched his video, but:
Some of the free sites (that I do use, and will be ceasing as soon as I reach the minimum payout) advertise you can get 1 or 2.5 uBTC. Turns out, you only get .5 or .3 from them. So that much is a scam in itself.
They work by throwing a bunch of ads at you, so they get impressions. Advertisers send money to the faucets, faucets forward a sliver of that amount to people filling in captchas. That bit isn't a scam. I'd be totally fine with 5 seconds of effort to get some coin while I watch a youtube video or something, and let us both gain money. It's just irritating when they have they don't pay out as much as they advertise they will.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:46:17
I missed the $650. It only got to $654 from what I saw. Was ready to buy. 20 seconds later, $750+...

Definitely feel free to start up a 0% purchase (not necessarily transaction) fee BTC business/service. I don't know how you'll be profitable, but it'd be popular. Advertisements I suppose would be your best bet.


The 1% when you convert from USD to BTC does go to coinbase. But the network transaction fee is explicitly stated to not go to coinbase when you do attempt a transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:56:51
The 1% fee on Coinbase isn't a transaction fee. It's merely a fee that Coinbase charges due to being a service for you. However, (bar black friday), Coinbase forces you to pay a transaction fee. The wallet Multibit does the same. The purpose of the transaction fee is to give an incentive to miners to keep mining and as a "thank you" for being there. The benefit of a fee is that miners will confirm your transaction a lot faster.
Supposedly the bitcoindevs are looking to make a more dynamic transaction fee protocal so that it doesn't cost $0.20 to transfer, and it goes back to the $0.02 or less that it was intended to be.
But ultimately, to your question, there's merely the fact that people would like to make a spot of a profit for servicing you. The 1% fee for ease of use isn't terrible. If you want to buy some BTC from a friend, you can definitely do that to get started.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:51:49
Can you give a bit more insight to the aging?
Say I'm depositing bitcoins into a particular address. Are all of my coins in the address considered as old as the most recent transaction? What if I have to use multiple addresses in my wallet to make a transaction?
