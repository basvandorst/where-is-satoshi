@_date: 2019-07-11 17:08:36
I don't believe this is true.  If you have the money in another crypto you run the risk of price disparity so when converted back to bitcoin the value could be significantly lower (or higher, tbf).  Many won't want to bear that risk for a payment.

You keep flip-flopping on your stances once you are confronted with facts.  I'd recommend spending some time conducting due diligence before making false claims.

I think you're not understanding the examples provided.  Maybe try reading the base comment again.
u/dalebewan isn't saying there is no point in competition.  He's saying the competition in protocols narrows over time to eliminate the inferior protocols.  He specifically compares the difference in competition between products and protocols.  You are mashing the two together in your response and not comprehending the differences.

Like how LTC works better than Bcash, I agree.

Technically, it has struggled to break below 8,000 as it's only done that once (briefly) over the last month.  Remained above 8,000 (even flirted with 10,000) otherwise.

Interesting opinion.  At what point would you consider bitcoin a failure even though (in your opinion) it hasn't reached a point from where it could actually demise?

Ha, we don't need tar on him.  Like all conmen, he will wither away in time as he produces nothing useful.  And he will die a sad, lonely death in his own time knowing that he contributed nothing to society and no one in all history needed nor depended upon him.

Excellent points.  r/btc folks are definitely more anti-bitcoin than they are pro-bcash.  This is why most of them abandoned bitcoin long ago to join alt-projects like bitcoin unlimited, bitcoin abc, segwit2x, etc...bcash is just their current project.  
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:28:11
Mainstream media (big 6 corp's that own &gt;90%) have not been saying "buy bitcoin".  They've been quite negative towards bitcoin (although some are starting to turn).
Honestly, I feel bad for you that this endeavor is the most productive use of your time.

OP's issue was with the time it took from the moment of purchase until the moment the coins were received.

As does any wise investor.  I've researched hundreds (if not thousands) of investments (as I'm sure you have as well).  Wise investors don't typically waste their time on bashing investments they classify as unsuitable or overly risky on public forums.
