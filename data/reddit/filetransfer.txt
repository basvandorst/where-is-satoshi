What are you going to do with your video card now? Are there any other pools set up similarly? I lost about $170 worth at the current price but would still rather not just have my card sitting around doing nothing.

A lot of people are subscribed to both?
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:54:48
Ha! No, sadly none of them are millionaires (Or letting on in any case) as most of them got in within the last year or less. They don't seem to have an issue with the price although I think reasons for owning a crypto currency range greatly from just being a symbol of tech savvy rebelliousness, to "day trading", to just really supporting the idea behind it ^or ^using ^it ^for ^drugs ^not ^^that ^^anyone ^^^would ^^^do ^^^that. So they tended to talk more about their motives/news the couple of times they've talked about it in depth.

So how much BTC does he have? What is the address? Does their transaction history contain anything interesting?
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:05:04
At what price would you consider someone an early adopter? (there is no way I am) I'm just curious because it may vary a lot depending on the person.

The Israeli state and the Israeli people/culture are two different things IMO. I don't see this documentary being state funded as far as I can tell and it's not like they are just giving money to the state so I don't really see how you reached this conclusion.
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:57:49
The "bubbles" kinda go in cycles with periods of exponential growth followed by a swift correction and should be looked at on a logarithmic scale for a better perception of adoption rate and overall growth. A lot more talk about this kinda stuff at since it doesn't really belong here.

I help out with a robotics team at my former high school in Houston when I can and, keeping in mind it is a robotics team, about 90% of the kids know what Bitcoin is to some degree and about one in 5 own some kind of crypto-currency.

Merry Christmas to you too!

Your comment assumes advice was given on the bases the father has a different risk profile. Advice could have been given b/c of improper assumption about the functioning of bitcoin. I.e. it is correct to think bitcoin is a risky investment. It is incorrect to think bitcoin is a ponzi scheme.

@_date: 2014-06-03 17:36:26
Right. To try and provide a bit better of an answer in place of OP fanatics, a growing number of businesses (idk a number you can Google it) are accepting bitcoin directly in addition to services like Gyft that allow you to buy gift cards  for 10s of thousands of others with BTC negating ever having to convert to fiat. The hope is that by nurturing and growing the bitcoin economy, eventually easier to use and streamlined services will arise.
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:22:30
People don't seem to be realizing you're not paying 3% more, Gyft is offering a 3% discount because that is their business model. The prices on overstock are the same regardless of being in BTC or USD while Gyft offers a 3% discount for dealing with the hassle of buying essentially a gift card that you have to now keep track of.

"he has a different risk profile than you" 
That was not mentioned or implied either. What I got out of it is just that the parents could be called idiots depending on the basis of the advice. It was just poorly argued.

How about some sort of arrangement where you set a goal of donations to the wallet, that by posting, you have already opened up for donations (purposefully or not) and in return for reaching that goal add Bitcoin as a donation method? The goal cost should include all implementation costs and possibly any estimated reduction in donations that the addition might incur. If the goal is not met you still come out with a gain of all coins donated for the period of consideration.

Spamming no matter how I look at it is hostile IMO b/c at that point you aren't convincing anyone of anything, you are simply drowning out any other voices.
You might be right about the customer is always right but there is an appropriate way to argue something and doing it that way we'd just kinda come off as assholes.
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:59:23
You asked how its more or less convenient. What kind of an answer did you want? Everyone has their own hobbies and if they find gambling with bitcoin fun why look down your nose at them for it?

Well my apartment complex accepts rent by check/money order with no fee or credit card payment with a 5% fee. No other options. So yeah... I still write checks. I've lived at 2 other places with similar policies too.

I guess I'm out of the loop but what exactly is BIP148?
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:01:43
I'm probably way off but isn't that a bucket exchange which is illegal at least in the US due to the ease of ledger fudging?
@_date: 2013-08-01 10:09:34
Why does this seem to good to be true? They are selling 1 bitcoin for $88 when coinbase has it at $98 and Gox $106. Why? Or better yet how? At least for any amount of time.
@_date: 2013-07-26 22:27:22
Thanks for that
@_date: 2013-07-26 21:57:29
I'm fine with people using it as long as they credit me. It would also be pretty cool to let me know where it gets used. Is there some sort of process to making it public domain?
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:19:30

How much is this costing you/what is your cap?
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:18:50
To be fair speculative trading to real transactions is somewhere closer to 20:1 or 21:1. So closer to 95%. I still agree with the idea but for some more accurate numbers I thought I'd mention that.
@_date: 2013-07-27 21:28:43
Cool site. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:09:29
Well I wouldn't say people over there don't back up theories. At least not the ones who are any good. It's just not a very exact science. But don't get me wrong I'm all for keeping them separate, I just think people who share a common interest could get along a little better.
@_date: 2013-07-27 08:46:50
That it does. I'm currently tweaking a noise map to accomplish the same thing just amplifying the x and lowering the y value to stretch it out vertically that way I can avoid the whole UV process and get a similar effect given it is a rather uniform texture all over the coin object. But should that end up looking to uniform or fake this would be my next option. Thanks for the texture! Now I don't have to go look for it :)
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:01:52
While I appreciate speculative discussion I think it belongs in and that is probably why all the hate. A lot of people here in don't seem to like speculators very much. Don't really get why...

So seriously considering getting into mining with these or something like these but what? Please explain the difference between the board and the chips to me like I'm 5. Thanks!

Ahh yes, but the reflections mostly point in the upward direction and lights didn't go so well. But I suppose I'll look into a ceiling fan or something of that nature.

No no, magic smoke. Don't let the magic smoke out or it won't work. Happened to a good computer once...

@_date: 2013-07-26 22:26:35
Yes, there is something like that. It looked rather odd not reflecting something. Just kind of a dull shine. I couldn't really see an alternative though.
