Make decisions with your brain, not your heart. If you simply forewent buying BCH out of spite, I sincerely pity you.

What's funny is that, without mentioning which sub, both subs will assume this comment is about their own sub.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:11:13
People still use Pbay? That site is honestly trash compared to private trackers.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:49:01
Why not just move all your money to the alt-coins and pay even less fees for moving big money around? I don't see how pushing alt-coins solves BTC's problem here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:44:51
Solid advice man. I respect that.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:16:19
The replies to you have already answered your question, but I'll add, that sometimes exchanges just get clogged down, ddos'd, or restrict trading when a new coin is released (the bitcoin forks come to mind). Again if you leave your money on the exchange, and don't have private keys, then you don't really have complete control of that money. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:45:53
So I'm curious to see if they come back to you after they try to transfer that money to an offline wallet, and ask, "where did my BTC go??"
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:16:05
ad homenims mean you have run out of solid arguments.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:57:34
The amount of beggers on her twitter now is cringeworthy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:21:32
Suit yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:00:59
It doesn't have to be a trial. You are making an accusation, you should provide proof. If you don't (which you aren't, because.. it doesn't exist? too lazy? doesn't matter the reason) then your argument will continue to have little to no weight, because you refuse to back it up with sources and facts. Period.

It sounds like you have some serious misconceptions about Koreans' attitudes towards their neighbors. Average Korean people do not hate or hold grudges against the Chinese or Japanese. The oldest generation does, I'll admit, but the younger generation really doesn't. I have lived in Korea for some time now, and at least 50% of every Korean I know has visited Japan at some point in their lives and have enjoyed it.
And Korea is extremely far from "economic domination" of either Japan or China. China sit's at second and Japan at third in terms of the worlds biggest economies in 2017 according to the world bank. Korea isn't even in the top ten (they are eleventh I believe).
I agree that Korea is always embracing and striving to innovate in every technological space, but they also cut corners at times (looking at you Samsung). Let's not forget about the rampant corruption in Korean politics concerning the chaebols.
Don't get me wrong, I love living and working in Korea. But I want to paint a bit more realistic view than the incredibly biased one posted above. To be honest it reads like Korean government propaganda.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:26:57
??? What are you talking about? I don't see any mass sell off lmao.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:58:54
This is the quality content I come to r/bitcoin for....
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:08
Lol you can already move and trade BCH, you're delirious if you think people are going to mass sell.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:23:25
I believe you are thinking of short selling which is different than futures (betting, essentially).
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:48:48
Sure, but don't leave your savings on an exchange wallet by any means. And once you transfer it to your offline wallet, never lose the private key..
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:01:15
Don't these guys also own a shit ton of Litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:07:02
It was a really easy decision. I only come still come here, because it's like watching a car accident. I also like to compare to r/wtf. It's entertaining and shocking in a "i-can't-look-away" way, but that's all.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:06:23
Because the burden of proof is always on the accuser.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:03:33
I agre that r/btc may care, but to say that r/bitcoin doesn't care is hilariously inaccurate.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:07:03
Well this happened recently, so they are trying. Now if they could only investigate Tether.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:13:07
This was supposed to be a joke, but you're proving the r/bitcoin side to be accurate..
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:10:55
Lol I do the same but with the subs reversed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:56
They say BCH is a pump and dump, but over the time frame in which BCH has been included in the market, it has massively outperformed BTC. People that say "pump and dump" in this case are either blinded by propaganda and aren't doing real research into new developments within the industry, or sold their BCH early and simply want to see it fail out of spite, or are afraid of BCH threatening BTC. In these cases people will do anything to discredit the current success of BCH. Only thing I can recommend you to do is read, and read a lot, from many different sources, then make your own decision.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:19:04
Yeah, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree here.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:34:27
Because that's stupid af? Diversify.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:39:52
Because it's not an attack? It's due to several factors including but not limited to: Coinbase (among many other exchanges) adding BCH recently, and the BTC mining difficulty increase.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:07:40
No argument of substance eh?
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:58:06
Teehee nice troll partner.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:36:12
It may have failed but I didn't glad I held onto the BCH, going to buy more when it drops again!
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:13:35
I trust myself to make the right choice and not random users on the internet
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:24:09
Lol pretty hypocritical of people to preach not taking investment advice from random people on reddit, and then downvoting my comment saying I'm not going to. Typical.
For the record, I put most of it back into BCH seeing as I come out with more tokens than I started with and it's not tanking. I put a bit into BTC and some into two other alt currencies. Diversify your assets fam.
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:21:18
Korbit does (as do many other Korean websites). But you would have to be Korean or have an Alien Registration number to join the site.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:11:49
"Smart guy but this was a bit autistic." is a very stupid and ignorant thing to say. Mind clarifying what you mean by autistic?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:00:51
Congratulations? I have investments in both BTC and BCH, but this sub is the biggest circle-jerk I've ever fucking seen lmao. When a post a menial as this hits the front page of the sub... just lmao
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:04:47
Wait why are people saying Bitcoin is crashing hard when, just last week everyone was EXPECTING a correction? Do you people have the memory of a fucking goldfish?
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:14:15
Thanks, not only are you being more mature and conscientious, your statement is also clearer than before. Cheers!
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:56:08
Congrats. You are nobody. Have a good one!
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:56:29
I've actually never been to that sub lol
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:20:14
Though it hasn't dropped anywhere close to where it started at a few weeks ago..
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:55:13
Meh I made a killing so what? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:36:30
Well that escalated quickly thanks to you. You don't have to be a complete dickhead. But people will be people I guess.
