Yeah in reality it's more of a conversation starter than anything. My idea was that my parents and brother don't care about BTC enough to appreciate receiving them... but if I give them something physical that looks cool, they'll feel less upset about receiving magic Internet money.

The dark areas are burned in. If the wood started chipping, the dark parts would still be dark. I think it would be very difficult to ruin the QR code and pubkey

PM me. I have enough of this cherry to cut out a few more. Might have some maple pieces too. They can be done on metal and glass as well, but the wood looks the best IMHO

Yeah that's the point. I'm giving these to my fam and I don't trust that they'll remember how to access a wallet. I'll be holding on to their dough unless they get really serious about BTC. And thanks for the compliment!

Im trying to gauge interest in Bee Line for BTC. I was one of the first Bee Line distributors, but the market became really competitive. I'm hoping that BTC will help revive my Bee Line business. This is a great product and I know people will love it as much as I do.

You're correct sir, my mistake. I have access to the equipment, it works just like a printer. Super rad

I have access to a laser engraver. They are pretty easy to make and they really came out better than I expected. I'll be giving them as Xmas gifts for the fam

Cherry wood ;)

Thanks! That was my brother's gift, I'm sure he will appreciate it

That looks rad!
