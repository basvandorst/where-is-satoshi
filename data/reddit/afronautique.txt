I honestly thought she was on heroin until he mentioned her visiting Israel.
Phew! So, she's not a junkie. She's Israeli!

Heroin.

Contains dextromethorphan. That's some *good shit!*

The correlation looks very weak, actually, at least just from looking at this plot.

Sorry to tell you this, but Bitcoin is libertarian -- non-whites in South Africa also have access to it, and they buy it in droves.

Your Apartheid-era propaganda is utterly wrong, and leaves you bereft of intellectual merit.
All the links below are to scientific papers by esteemed authors, published in high-impact journals. Not The Daily Stormer. 
Black Iron Age agriculturalists arrived in South Africa -- crossing the Limpopo River -- some 1500 to 2000 years ago:
* "[archeologists were able to collect large amounts of information and to demonstrate, with radiocarbon dating, that the farming communities were established in the subcontinent by 200 AD](
* "[By the fourth century Iron Age sites begin to appear in Rhodesia; and by the seventh and eighth centuries there is evidence of a fairly wide spread Iron Age culture extending [...] into the northern Transvaal.](
* There are several other papers on this, many of which authored by Huffman, which use linguistic and pottery evidence to show that amaZulu were in the North East of the country by 500 AD. 1500 years ago, *not* in the 1500s.
The rest of your rambling, rabid diatribe does not deserve a serious response. There are no citations I can give you that will prove you're an uncultured nincompoop -- it's patently clear to anyone who reads what you wrote. 
But don't get it twisted: ideas about when black people arrived in South Africa are not a matter of opinion or "post-truth". The academic world has known definitively for perhaps a century. Whites were fed lies in school 
, and now that they're older and capable of thinking for themselves, they willingly choose delusion over established scientific fact.

Ain't confusion. Willful, cynical, disingenuous ignorance motivated by an undeserved sense of racial superiority.

Being subjected to the same crime that the rest of the non-White population has to endure is not "genocide".
One truly needs to be a special kind of entitled, deluded snowflake to be a white South African. Africa has never been easy for *anyone*, bitch. What's so special about your lack of melanin that means you should be exempt from that state of affairs, and the state should fall all over itself insulating you specifically against crimes everyone else will endure as a matter of course?
The fucking nerve!

The government in South Africa does not persecute whites. Literally almost no one believes that. 
You need to get out more.

You're blowing smoke out your ass.
And no, slave masters who orchestrated an evil system that resulted in the majority population of the region being denied citizenship, yet being expected to provide labour, mine the gold, build the infrastructure, and cook your food and wipe your children's asses -- these brutes and boors did not build anyone any infrastructure.
Keep believing that pure, unadulterated evil and delusions of racial superiority trump the hard labour and super-human patience and willingness to forgive of the "glorified apes" (as you call them) who finally aren't being subjugated by your ilk on their own fucking continent.

* Struggle songs are a relic of the past, like your brethren waving apartheid flags while playing victim. Afrikaners are not Jews -- they are not God's chosen children being persecuted in the promised land. They're petty criminals who have been pardoned without even asking for forgiveness, and are now lamenting why their victims refuse to believe their delusional Christian lies.
* There are no land thefts.
* Farm murders are part of the crime that we all have to put up with. If isolated, gun-owning farmers who mistreat their workers and run their land as if they were medieval European feudal lords -- expecting to be called "baas" and shooting black children foraging for discarded food because they "mistook them for monkeys" -- end up being murdered at rates higher than statistics would suggest they should, well they can get in line behind black women, the residents of the Cape Flats, residents of black townships, and all the other groups who have a disproportionately high murder rate: they are all equally human.
* Of course you would pull Affirmative Action out of your ass. The government needs to put laws in place to force you to play properly with the other kids in the school yard, because time and time again the moral degeneracy of your kind has been on display for the whole world to see. Why the fuck would anyone think you would willingly accept fair competition over jobs and other resources, against glorified apes, which you have acquired through hook and crook?

Black people suffer the most at the hands of criminals. They do not think themselves superior, and do not lament being tainted disproportionately by the brush of violent crime as an act of "genocide."
By the way, you will notice that literally no one outside of South Africa believes, in light of the evidence, that Whites are being genocided. It's literally a local delusion couched upon a deep-seated belief that people are less than human. 
I mean, why would you lament the murders of your pet monkeys?
I argue with you here not to convince you that I am human -- I know this already and don't require your acknowledgement -- but to demonstrate, to anyone else reading this, the profound detachment from reality and intellectual and moral poverty of a worryingly large number of white people in South Africa. The world watches, and shakes its head in disappointment.

Thanks for talking in the hypothetical.

They're meant to be clicked and read. Let me help you with your English language comprehension.
In summary, terms like "agriculturalists", "farmers", "pastoralists", and "Iron Age" are referring to the people you called "Bentu." The Khoi had cattle, but they didn't have any other kind of agriculture, and had Stone Age societies. The San/Bushman had no livestock, and were typical Stone Age hunter-gatherers. Certainly, the Khoisan were not building large settlements and mining gold in Mapungubwe and Zimbabwe, and trading it with India and China, at least a thousand years ago.
You clearly did not even click on the links. The titles of the papers refer to "Nguni" and "Bantu." They're not talking about the Khoisan, whites, Phoenicians, Israelites, or any other cultures white South Africans have variously believed left behind this archeological evidence, instead of the black people who live in those areas till this day.
Moreover, not only did I open the links I gave, I also read them.
If you're having trouble perusing the content of those papers, SciHub is your friend. You would know that, and know how to use it, if you were in the least bit academically-inclined.
If you want to know how old the Iron Age is in Sub-saharan Africa, then you could search for works on the Nok civilisation situated in present-day Nigeria. There is much controversy as to whether the Bantu speakers when they first left the Congo some three thousand years ago, were already in the Iron Age (despite linguistic evidence suggesting Proto-Bantu speakers already had words for metal, cattle, iron hammers, ore, furnaces, and other Iron-Age technologies), but certainly, by the time Mapungubwe sprang up South of the Limpopo River some 1000 years ago, these glorified apes were living in sophisticated, advanced Iron-Age city states. 


After enduring half a thousand years of your bullshit we forgive you and leave you to stay here in relative prosperity, and yet this is how you behave after having equality and democracy forced upon you for only 24 years?
Seriously. Just fuck off to Europe already and live among your kin, so we can continue rebuilding our society and not waste energy on your paranoid delusions.
No, we won't even give you the satisfaction of a civil war, or even the genocide you so gleefully seem to believe you deserve. Just fuck off already. ��

Sounds like a thought loop from NBOMES. You'd better reagent test that shit!
