Well it wasn't so funny because i understand danish. So it didn't make sense in the beginning. But it was pretty fun he got REKT...

How is that even news now? I could do that over to months ago on Coinbase.

It's fun how it says Bitcoin Cash in centralized do to cost of participation of large block size. But Lightning will not introduce centralization with big hubs?
I also think the use of ASIC mining make the whole ecosystem more centralized for both.

Why buy 7k, when you can wait a month and get sub 5-4k?

Yeah but what about, you have to pay a fee for buying and selling your BTC? It would probably cost the same as PayPal in the end, without having trouble with getting a wallet or making an account on some exchange to get hi's money.

Agree with Ewokjed1. I also used to buy games on Instant-gaming. And there was almost nothing wrong with transaction speed.

Sad that only 1% chance for transfer over 200$ would get through Lightning Network. I really hope it will improve fast!  And i hope we will get rid of the centralization that is starting to appear on the Lightning Network. 0.4% of total nodes currently have 53% of the network’s capacity.

Nice even more centralization !

How can you say Bitcoin Cash is a centralized shitcoin, when Lightning is becoming ten times more centralized? Don't give me wrong, because i'm not a fan of Bitcoin Cash. I prefer the original Bitcoin. But i don't like that blocksize increase of Bitcoin to 2MB was dismissed. Dismissed for it would make it more centralized, but then they make Lightning Network, that is doomed to become even more centralized than almost any other coins on the market. What is that!?
