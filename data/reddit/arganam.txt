Very interesting topic.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:12:26
This one? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:11:04
What's wrong with Kraken now?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:43:45
I'm with you except I think it will be a disaster due to margin trading...
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:34:54
Well I guess we now know *two* companies to never use. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:58:02
Billions and billions and billions and billions.

I have trouble with the whole, "increasing the block size at all makes it too expensive to run a node".  I run a node that costs only $5 per month, if it were $6 or even $10 per month I wouldn't stop it.

At what block exactly does this BCH EDA fork happen?
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:16:21


Why wouldn't BTC want to have something like that?  What would be the drawback?  Wouldn't that prevent the dreaded "chain death spiral"?

Fiber or not there are certainly no dialup lines.

They could hav don it with a soft fork...

OK but why does that have to be 100% local?  And how does pruning then work?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:14:00
Why doesn't Bitcoin change the difficulty re-targeting system to eliminate the "death spiral" possiblity?  
What is the drawback to calculating difficulty based upon the average hashrate of the last N blocks?  
I believe BCH is doing the last 144, but that's an arbitrary number, it could be anything.
I assume there is some drawback to doing this but I can't think of it off the top of my head.

Nobody is talking about 10MB+ blocks at this point in time. On the table has been 2-8MB. Since you can run a full node with 1MB blocks on total junk throwaway hardware, it isn't going to be prohibitively expensive to increase the block size a little. I understand at some point you may need to raise it again, but by that point in time hardware will be better, faster and cheaper.
I do agree that simply increasing the blocksize probably won't work in and of itself if any mainstream adoption is achieved any time soon, but the idea that we *must stay at 1MB at all costs* after nearly a decade of advances in hardware and technology is ludicrous.  The whole BCH/BTC fiasco probably could have been avoided if a modest blocksize increase was done while other solutions were investigated/developed.
I find "*Yes but 100MB will be too expensive on today's hardware!*" to be a really stupid argument for why not 2 or 4MB.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:31:51
What's going on with Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:55:45
I think it's ridiculous they didn't go to at least 2 or 4MB but BCH is not playing this better with all their bullshit.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:16:35
No pruning removes old blocks from the node’s local database.  It’s configurable. You set the database size to X with a minimum of 2GB I think and then it “prunes” the oldest blocks.

A puny little chinese needle dick? I think not. Confuciious say: perhaps will snap him like toothpick.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:05:49
Same thing coinbase... zero support.  Waiting more than a week to get verified.  No answer from support at all. 
Agree about using your own wallet, but when you want to trade you gotta do it somewhere...
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:46:55
I'm sure that's where he got the money to start exchange... thank god I don't have kids though.
Although these guys made a whole business about that: 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:57:41
Tell us more about how nobody buys tech stuff because they know a better one will be cheaper tomorrow...
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:52:07
You've been brain washed into this deflation doom bullshit.  The entire tech industry is deflationary, yet it thrives and new billionaires are minted all the time.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:58:26
Just the tip of the ice berg...
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:14:36
Hoping he's right!
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:52:44
Takes one to know one?  LOL!
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:44:57
I'm sure he did, but I don't drink coke.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:52:56
Yes also overlooked is that you can divide a bitcoin into an infinite number of pieces (100,000,000 now but the decimal can be shifted if/when necessary).
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:03:13
I'm starting to get worried, now I'm having trouble logging in.

No any miner can't "do that".  A satoshi is still basically worth nothing even at today's rates.  There is plenty of old mining hardware that will not generate enough bitcoin to be worth anything at all even at today's exchange rates.
The question is what kind of miner can yield ~$500 USD worth of bitcoins at a $4,000 - $5,000 per BTC exchange rate?  
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:28:23
Yet another reason not to tell anyone how much cryptocurrency you have.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:18:50
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:42:40
It's about to be.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:08:10
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:27:50
Well just read the article...
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:59:53
Good for them, I'll still be keeping all mine in my own wallet...
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:17:09
That is an option yes but I thought with all the hype around crypto currency, and now tokens that facilitate real estate transfer, i might be able to reach a wider audience and find a buyer more quickly and/or for a better price.  Maybe a long shot but just a thought.
For example:  (I bet that one is not actually the first, others are claiming the same).

The central authority can always invalidate or inflate your cash any time they want.

Tether is still a scam, this is a reason to doubt Binance also.
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:01:23
I wish I knew but they haven't even touched the ticket.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:20:32
I could not understand what this little old man was saying to me...
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:07:58
I'm surprised that hasn't happened already.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:14:36
Hoping he's right!
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:31:30
I’m in the same boat. I’ve got some of the picture but it’s very hard to fill in the gaps.
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:31:58
What sources do you recommend.
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:52:08
The lawyer and the escrow do not have to be the same entity.

There are plenty of exchanges for all major currencies.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:48:21
Case looks really stupid. A finger print is not a good way to secure that for what ought to be obvious reasons.  Trezor’s passphrase functionality is fantastic and gives you plausible deniability as well as an easy way to hide the fact you ever even used a passphrase. It’s by far the best system I’ve seen.  Just wish they would add a confirmation field for ETH like they have for BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:35:50
Great but what is the counter argument about all the slimy money (like AXA) that’s invested in Blockstream which in turn has influence over core.
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:49:29
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:20:44
Really? Some random chinese guy that started another questionable exchange less than a year ago?  Yea sounds like gold to me... NOT.
@_date: 2017-09-12 09:01:57
Fucked by Kraken here too...
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:39:29
Bitcoin hard limits its supply.
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:59:19
