0.001% of world population is 70,000 users. Only Coinbase (the most popular US exchange) has 10M+ users.
So, it's 3% of the US, or 0.3-0.5% of the whole world (including india, china and the poor states that have most of the world population).

The only weakness I see here is when someone generated his private key with a spoiled RNG with a vulnerability found.
Otherwise - use dice and you’ll be safe.

Watch this:
It's a online tool for doublespending bitcoins. Pretty much like BitUndo was, but a new one.
Tried it myself - and it indeed works.
Although I wouldn't risk putting high amounts there, cause you know, it can always be a hidden scam. But doublespending 1$ worked pretty fine.

1) "doesn't work long term" - why?
2) causes more centralization - why?


3) Why not both? These are completely different things.


4) There are no sides. And what I see here is - politics is a killer of mind.
How much I wish that some PhD's sit and apply game theory or something else to this debate and put it clear and correct from the **tech** side, not this dirty political side.
I'm not a frequent guest at but each time I go here - all I see here is a freaking **SHITSTORM** someone vs someone, something vs something.
"**A** were supportive of **X**, but it turned out that **A** were malicious =&gt; thus **X** is bad."
C'mon, turn on some logic? Anyone?
