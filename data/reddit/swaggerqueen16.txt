I put $498 in November
Since that time, I've played with alt coins and Bitcoin and have made $3000
I never traded or anything, just hodled different coins based on what I researched and liked. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:50:23
Maybe some people are just smarter at setting things up than you?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:06:56
Buy around now if you can. This dip probably won't last too long.

But what if I don't care about the share or the technology, but purely about the return on price?
I just bought 21 IOTA for $100 and even if it only goes from $5 to $20 that's still more worth it to me than if I bought $100 in bitcoin. 
Unless Bitcoin goes from $20000 to $80000 in the same amount of time (I still have $550 in btc now)

Damn that's a lot 
I've only got about $800 so far. Welcome to the hodl!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:30

PayPal isn't available everywhere.
Plus you have to go through a third party.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:06:49
Dogecoin is on the up
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:14:20
But it's not just that.
PayPal can hold your funds for whatever reason they desire, governments can stop PayPal/Banks for their own reasons. 
It's harder to corrupt bitcoin

@_date: 2017-10-13 04:46:56
I'm not asking if anyone knows for sure, but if enough people are thinking it's going to be a certain way, then I'd trust them.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:13:14
Dogecoin is also excepted only at the cafeteria

Isn't it super important to put those in a hardware wallet?
I would think 25-30k would be enough insentive
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:05:49
Yeah, ive done about $10 yesterday, and $50 a few hours ago. 
It's already depreciated a little bit, but I actually hope it drops further so I can buy low

Yes, and it might drop down below what you bought it at in a week, so don't get too excited just yet

You're 15 and know about bitcoin. I'd say you're already ahead of most people your age
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:52:14

Do they accept bitcoin? I want a nice tapestry for my window.
