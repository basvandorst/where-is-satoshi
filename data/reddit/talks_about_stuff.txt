They run different protocols and a lot don't require mining so they are more scalable. But many in one form or another lose true decentralization which Bitcoin has achieved. So it really depends on what you look for in a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin to me is digital gold, it's a terrible form of currency due to its ever increasing value. And transactions are expensive,slow, and not to mention now contributing quite a bit to climate change. With the implementation of LN, a lot of the scalability issue has been solved and speed improved. But at the end of the day there are much better ways to process transactions than the bitcoin network. Check out this detailed article on Stellar Lumens that makes these comparisons [Empty Bucket UK article on Stellar Lumens and comparison with Bitcoin and Ethereum](

Agree wholeheartedly, also Ethereum but these 3 are hardly altcoins, they are so unique should be unicoirns 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:08:52
thats only from a hodlers perspective，what if he wants to cash out little by little？Also this type of behavior is contributing to the mass adoption of btc and crypto and should be encouraged. If we have any hopes of the bubble not popping eventually，the price of btc will need to stabilize，and with LN online and fully functional 500 years from now I dont see why it wouldn't be used for daily usage.

Its simply put but also true. To short something you have to secure buyers in contracts and you will deliver at a later time because you expect prices to crash. You can bet they are stockpiling bitcoin so they can dump it to drive the price down even further. And a few hundred millions is enough to start a panic，while they are going to reap rewards on their billions of dollars worth of short contracts. Just know that bitcoin WILL recover stronger than before and remember - these derivative products dont directly impact the market，but they give people incentives to manipulate the market and thats the dangers of it. So just keep all of this in mind and position yourselves，its nothing we havent seen before，dont make split-second decisions that you will regret later.

First of all very sorry about your loss.
Make sure you ignore solicitations and private messages offering to help in private and stay on this thread.
IRL, Don't give anyone the USB or tell anyone about it. DO THE FOLLOWING -
Unplug or disconnect your computer from the internet, plug the USB in and check the contents. If it's still usable, back up all the files on there to the computer. After you do this, NEVER, I repeat, NEVER connect the computer to the internet ever again. Now look through the contents on the flash drive and describe them as best as you can(what types of files are in there) without disclosing specific details such as file names, or contents when you open them. If you are reading this, maybe share what you find with the sub so we can guide you further. 
you are looking for something like a random series of letters and numbers or maybe even a file, or a QR code. Regardless what you find, DESCRIBE it don't post the code or any pictures of what you find. If anyone else has something to add please chime in! Hope this can help you recover your brother's legacy!

Abundance or scarcity on a grand universal scale does not define local distribution. The likelihood of us encountering a solid gold asteroid is still ORDERs of magnitudes more likely than meeting an alien civilization with superior technology that will enlighten us instead of destroy us.

Hey man I feel your pain, when you’ve got the time Check out Sureremit, it’s an African based non-cash remittance company and one of their many functions is allowing users to purchase digital vouchers/gift cards with cryptocurrency from major retailers all over the world. They are built on the Stellar blockchain. And the company has been in the retailer/gift card business for many years. 
App is live right now and PlayStation store is on there, along with steam, amazon, target, etc. and there’re no fees.

Doesn’t his sub do the same to people from in fact I see a lot of people going to because they get banned here. Maybe the way to beat them at their own game is to stop banning people from this sub too
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:53:27
So they are just spinning every ban here differently on to mislead people? Or maybe there’s not that many bans to begin with according to what you’re saying. I’ve left a little while ago but while I was there a good amount of posts were about someone getting banned here and then joining the bcash movement. In retrospect a lot of the stories were probably manufactured anyway.

I don’t agree with this analogy, since printing technology has been around for ages, and it can only be used to well, print stuff. Distributed Ledger Technology is revolutionary because it doesn’t just print digital coins, its applications are still being explored and it’s very shortsighted to only hail the coin and disregard the technology which enabled it and gave it value in the first place. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-25 11:48:20
You should worry if both parties cooperated on EVERYTHING, checks and balances goes out the window and congress takes out that big fat purple dildo and fucks the people in the ass, more so than it’s already doing. So thank your lucky stars they have different target audiences that motivate them a little differently.

The derivatives market is the biggest man made bullshit ever. It caused the mortgage meltdown and historically fucked up the rare metals market - ie. gold, silver, you name it. It only benefits those who run these financial casinos while the average Joes just gamble away their hard earned money hoping to come out on top. It doesn’t take much for them to make you think you’ve got a losing hand, and you fold right when they want you to, or contrarily they can lure you in to doubling down at the worst times. Our best chances are to keep our emotions and play by the book like you would blackjack, buy the dips and take some profit after rallies. The House always wins, but you can improve your chances by learning the rules of the game. Don’t get caught up in the FUD or FOMO mentalities, don’t get caught up in the HODL mentality. I know it’s difficult but never shut yourself off from opposing views, always check what the other side is saying. Also Spend some of your earnings, reinvest in yourself and people you care about! Cheers!

The first mover advantage works well for companies that capitalize on it and further expand to Even for companies that were “too big to fail” in a budding industry，ie. Blockbuster，AOL，etc. can fuck up and they did. Bitcoin is no different in terms of its vulnerabilities to innovations since it began as an unrefined consensus algorithm and grew over the years. but it has limitations set by its original structure that makes it hard to future-proof despite all the talented devs working on it. They are also not incentivized by a paying employer, only probably by their own stakes in bitcoin and also maybe blind faith in what’s become almost a cult. If you ask me that’s not very sustainable, because their goals and motivations could change at any moment. Recent flip flopping of core devs on important issues kind of shows that some of them have no idea what they are doing. 
NOW, I am by no means advocating for bitcoin cash or BCash as this sub likes to call it. I am simply stating the fact that this time things are slightly different than previous bitcoin “crashes”, because an unprecedented amount of global media coverage and publicity in the last few months have brought more than just bitcoin into the spotlight once again, and it’s bitcoin’s competitors. I don’t believe any of them will replace bitcoin, most of them aren’t designed to do so. But many ARE designed to dominate more specific sub markets with their innovation and utility. Eventually we will see micro-economies using different crypto currencies, using ones that make the most sense for the specific application. And bitcoin money will flow into these Alts like we’ve been seeing already. 
So where does that leave bitcoin? Well sadly without slightly commercializing or “centralizing” bitcoin, it is really up to the community of hodlers to prop up the value of bitcoin. But most hodlers will jump ship if enough evidence presents itself, eg. core devs giving up on bitcoin development. Without organizations working on the technology and improving it, we are just leaving our fates in the hands of internet strangers and hodlers. Sure there are bitcoin related businesses but they do not depend on the success of bitcoin. Satoshipay dropping bitcoin and switching to Stellar network due to bitcoin fees and speed is a prime example. 
Businesses can bank on the success of bitcoin without relying on the success of bitcoin. Bitmain is another example, they bring in massive profits due to the success of bitcoin but we all know they do not give two shits about the future of bitcoin and their repeated efforts to undermine it while profiting from bch pumps shows that. That’s why we have never seen any of these businesses give back to the bitcoin community to help spread adoption or support development, because they do not care. 
So what am I getting at? At the end of the day it’s YOU the community that give bitcoin it’s value, if more people choose to adopt bitcoin then its value will grow. But a lot of of those people will undoubtedly stumble upon alternative crypto as they dig deeper and most likely diversify, or abandon bitcoin altogether. Because right now it’s not true adoption, it’s swarm after swarm of people trying to double their money in a few weeks and then gtfo. If this sub is obsessed with the price and price memes, then those are the types of people it will attract. If this sub fostered more technical discussions and less bashing of other competing crypto and techs, it will attract developers and likeminded people who may one day even contribute to core. 
Bitcoin millionaires of this sub, instead of worrying about your dwindling btc stack why not donate to fund second layer solutions of bitcoin? If bitcoin gave you your massive wealth then doesn’t it make sense to give back a little since it will also help sustain your wealth? 
A few things to consider for you rich bastards - 
Lightning network development is still incomplete, 
Other methods of offchain scaling to be explored
Segwit adoption can be sped up using monetary incentives
Creating fungible tokens on bitcoin blockchain and smart contract capabilities
The point is we shouldn’t be telling the sub not to worry, we should be educating each other on WHY we should worry and what we can do to help bring solutions. Just solely relying on the “authenticity” of bitcoin is not gonna get us very far...

Thats like saying the market share of AOL represents the usage of the internet. Bitcoin may have introduced the idea of blockchain，it is not the face of Distributed Ledger Technology, in fact some may even argue DLT has already evolved past Bitcoin’s technology and is years ahead, since bitcoin started off on an imperfect construct - the POW consensus model

I found myself nodding multiple times while reading this article，only things I disagree with are DASH and EOS being worthy of mention，Winter Soldier is more like OMG，a perfect complement to Ethereum（Steve）but started to make his own path to become something greater. And lets not forget Antman who is like NANO，little guy who fights for the little guys（fast micropayments）. Or IOTA，like scarlet witch I guess，its supposedly powerful，but noone understands how it works，unstable at times. Or War Machine，kinda like Bitcoin Cash，got his start from riding off of Tony's tech，but thinks his big guns（bigger blocks）are the solution，in reality kind of a joke to the rest of the avengers.
