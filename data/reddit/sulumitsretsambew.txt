I tend to agree, if they even try to hint at re-enable withdrawals for "unaffected" clients they will be tied in litigation and legal motions for starting bankruptcy proceedings. No way people will accept a haircut without going through the legal system. The only way this doesn't go to a lengthy court process is if an outside investor shells out the funds to make clients whole for equity/control of the company.

**Edit: Looks like it's back and working now.**
For about 10 hours when trying to place a trade or check balance I get a chunk of HTML instead of the JSON reply.
Looks like some kind of DDOS prevention wall, looks like it tries to check if javascript is enabled in the browser.
Definitely not something you should do on an API request. (what javascript?)
Tried from a different location and with a different API key, same problem.
Ticker and order depth work fine but can't place trades.
Something like: 
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/_Incapsula_Resource?SWJIYLWA=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style="margin:0px"&gt;&lt;iframe src="/_Incapsula_Resource?CWUDNSAI=23&amp;incident_id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;edet=12&amp;cinfo=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" frameborder=0 width="100%" height="100%" marginheight="0px" marginwidth="0px"&gt;Request unsuccessful. Incapsula incident ID: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

I bought bitcoin because of reddit.
I was on reddit before bitcoin even existed, now get off my lawn.

He certainly sent it, it's a problem in the postal protocol.

Another potential problem is what happens in case of issues with the delivery or if the product does not match the description. 
You now need to communicate with the seller via a middle man because you are not the actual buyer.
A lot of stuff can get lost in translation.
I don't think this service is viable or profitable for the 1-2% commission.

For small items I understand the benefit on snapcard but for large items why not just sell on coinbase and buy in cash.
As far as I understand there is no tax benefit in the US, you still have to report gains. 
You have a much better control of negotiations and less potential of problems because you are paying the merchant in cash and not confusing him with magic internet money.
Week long process for god sake, how is this better than buying with cash?

They both used coinbase so it's in fact an off block chain transaction entirely settled inside the coinbase database.

Bitcoin was started in January 2009, in the whole year of 2009 about 1.2 million coins were mined.
The trading volume is really low compared to bitcoin holdings.
Only about 500K coins per day on all the exchanges combined, including day trading.
The top 500 wallets hold about 35% of all bit coins in existence, which is a really low estimate for the percentage because one person can hold an unlimited number of wallets.
I would guess you would have to sell very slowly to maximize your profit.
Also just moving a large number of BTC to the exchange wallet could produce a crash, since these transactions are noticeable in the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:39:13
Do they understand the technical limitations? The block size is limited in the curent implementation to 1MB, this works out to an average of 7 transactions per second globally. If the devs don't increase the block size soon we may run into trouble if transaction volumes increase by a factor of 3. Also the minimal fee is something to keep in mind, now it's equivalent to 8 cents and paid by the customer. You can send 0.01 BTC or more for free but it takes a while to be confirmed - 3 hours in some cases.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:48:38
I mean **technically** there is no difference.
People say in the news bitcoin is limited to 21m coins. Well that limit is just some code in the node. Change it in the majority of nodes and we magically have more.
By the way increasing the block size also has financial implications, if miners can produce infinitely large blocks they can swell the block chain with any transactions including ones with dust level fees. The block size doesn't significantly affect the time it takes to find the nonce. The block chain can swell to terabytes in size killing the entire system.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:17:49
The one with the highest fee would have the best chance, depends on network transaction load. There is no guarantee that the transaction will even fit in the next block or the one after that, it depends on tx volume, fee and tx priority.
For example I've sent a small amount without a fee and it took 4 hours to be included in the chain.

If somebody steals they might as well use a mixing service or just transfer through a thousand new wallets making backtracing difficult.
There is no way to use the blockchain to prove that the guy that tried to sell on MtGox was the one who stole the coins.

Keep in mind that no mater how amazing bitcoin is, in it's heart it is just a prototype coded by (most likely) one guy. Because of it's distributed nature the core can't be easily changed, extended or upgraded. There is a lot of interesting work done on layers created on top of the bitcoin block chain (basically using it as an infrastructure) with collored coins - like  for example.
I doubt Satoshi had any idea it would grow to a world wide system with such a relatively fast rate, otherwise he maybe had put a little more effort into speedier confirmations and transaction per second limits.

Like bitcointip? Transfer to the payment system's trusted wallet ahead of time and then pay from there using a trusted BTC nominated payment card?

The fork in March was a bug.
That's not the limit I am talking about.
I am talking about MAX_BLOCK_SIZE which is capped at 1MB in the protocol.
Edit : read here 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:04:52
one tenth of a bitcoin?
10 bitcents?
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:39:29
Increase of the block size will probably happen but I do think we will start hitting the limit first (causing delays at high volumes) and only then will the devs/community take it seriously enough to finally do something about it.
It's not simple that's for sure, here are some discussions about how to increase the block size.
Basically the suggestion is to add a framework, wait for the majority of the network to upgrade to the version with the framework, then nicely ask all the miners to enable production of blocks with the larger size.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:14:15
It's incredibly difficult because it breaks backward compatability, i.e. old clients on the bitcoin network will not function correctly and there is no feasible way to force everyone to upgrade.
I haven't dug into the code and it's never been done before but I envision something like the following:
1) design an extension to the protocol that would allow larger block sizes (right now such block are rejected by bitcoin nodes) but miners don't yet create such blocks.
2) encourage/beg/request for bitcoin nodes and miners to upgrade.
3) when a sufficient number of nodes upgrades - let's say 80%, the miners are requested to turn a flag to create blocks larger than 1MB.
At this point any nodes which have not upgraded start rejecting the larger blocks and cannot send transactions to the network - because they are out of sync.
Assuming all miners upgrade to mining the larger blocks the old nodes would need to upgrade in order to see any changes.
However the troubles start if some miners continue mining the smaller blocks, in that case there would be two forks of the blockchain, the ones with the &gt;1MB blocks and ones with &lt;=1MB blocks, it would be a total mess.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:19:03
The payout is too small. They wouldn't put in the effort required.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:45:06
I am not convinced significant protocol changes are possible, you need to upgrade the majority of the nodes near or at the same time or something will break.
If we are doing that there is nothing preventing us from increasing the confirmation time to 2 minutes, increasing total number of coins or block rewards.
It's very possible that we maybe stuck with what we have.
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:54:07
I am talking about the 1MB hard limit, not the top X KB of transactions sorted by fee the miners are picking up.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:41:50
They will have to work with 0 confirmations, you can't have a person hold up the register for 10 minutes
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:26:59
This only means that the block chain is already stressed because of greedy miners who want higher fees even before the hard limit is reached.
If they can't be convinced to change a command line parameter who is going to convince them to upgrade and enable larger block sizes when considering the risks to their fees.
MtGox just increased the network fee for BTC withdrawls to 0.001 BTC - that's more than 1$.
So much for low transaction fees.


@_date: 2013-11-20 16:18:35
I would guess more, if only to look trendy, but certainly not proportionate to the last year increase in price.
If I was a merchant I would be scared as hell.
Fuck the zero transaction fees, if I still pay for my goods in fiat currency, a 50% per day conversion rate swings can kill a business very quickly.
Even if using bitpay, it appears that transaction fees (if you are counting their very high exchange rate) are pretty high, their exchange rate is not as high as MtGox but about 7% higher than BTC-E.
