Hi all,
I thought of all places the community might be interested in this domain name. Apologies if it doesn't really fit here!

'a brief guide to cryptocurrencies'
@_date: 2016-03-06 21:44:41
That's kind of what I've done for my introductory chapter. I'll be sure to focus a bit more in it though!

Cool idea!

ooh, great! Thanks

I will do!
Yes, I believe I will do a self-published eBook with Amazon.
I'll be sure to include info about some of the workings of cryptography in later chapters.
Thanks for your suggestions!

Sorry. Any alternative suggestion for a subreddit where this belongs?

Sorry again. I'll admit I didn't read the posting guidelines.

I'm looking to sell the domain name  so I've put it up for auction on Flippa.com with no reserve. Go take a look and see if it takes your fancy.
Apologies if this post is misplaced here -- I thought of all places would be the most interested in this.

I had tried sedo but they suspended my account. Flippa seems to get a lot less for domains, though.
