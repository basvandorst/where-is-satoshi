I think the biggest problem is that for bitcoin to have any real world use (which is the long term hope), then its value needs to be accounted for in the real world, not just against current resources and currencies, but also for taxation issues involving real world financial, economic and government systems. That is where the problem of real world inclusion of bitcoin lies. I still think the whole Bitcoin idea and execution still has massive social value, even if it takes another 10 or 20 years to become properly established and accepted. I'll wait, no problem. OP is entitled to his own opinion of course, it always good to see people's differing opinion on these issues and for that reason I'll upvote him.

Privacy is deep rooted in the human psyche, its why we wear clothes, because there are parts of us that we feel need to be private.

Keepass has its own keyboard which it switches into for you to enter passwords. There can also be a seperate keyfile as well as the master password.

Yes, you can save your encrypted password file in the cloud (Dropbox / Google Drive), then you open it with a password locally, u can optionally need another third key file which can also be stored on the cloud (even a different service to the password file).
The same password file is stored locally too, and it gets synced.
All in all I see no reason to move from KeyPass. It works exactly the same whether on Windows  or Android or portable USB version which works on Linux too.

If u follow the thread my reply was to u/Dougscrip when he mentions how grandma buys and sells bitcoins and his niece and nephew have bitvoin wallets. It might be true, but I seems unbelievable and the sort of comment a troll would say. That's why I asked him if he was trolling, nothing to do with you.

are you trolling?
@_date: 2015-04-04 19:58:05
Because...  I think he missed the point of Bitcoin completely. Money puts value on effort and energy expenditure and bitcoin can address this in a decentralised non corruptable (so far) way. That's why Bitcoin is slowly gaining tread in the big world. End of.

Some hackers somewhere will be totally up for this challenge, and is probably working on it right now due to this article giving them the idea.

Thats a fair reply. Thanks.

The internet also has Reddit where someone can get a more specific answer faster. So he's cleaely got his big boy pants on. And asked a valid question with valid concerns and wanted the opinion of others. If he did a search on search engine then user contribution is what he'll end up finding, much like this reddit post. So your answer was awful and unconstructive. You're basically just trolling.

I wouldnt want it in a bank account, just into a wallet for fun, and i send back, I get that you need to get an exchange company to convert it into real money and you probably lose value due to their fees then, well i'll sit tight and see what happens
