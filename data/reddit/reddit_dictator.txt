What country your from might help.
edit:Whatever you do Don't go [here]( Nothing wrong with em just don't like how he uses bitcoin.

It isn't centralized, it's [distributed](
@_date: 2014-06-18 05:11:05
This is a good idea.

How active is localbitcoins in those areas? If he's moving from one big city to another, it's possible he could do it with no fees if he finds traders in both locations. Even simply finding a local trader on either end would drastically reduce the cost.......Assuming he doens't get mugged.
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:59:12
I've been out of WoW for soo long, but I definitely would have tipped some of the people I pugged with late at night. 
I wonder what kind of effect this would have on the community though.
Either way I'll likely try this guy out when I re-sub for WOD.
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:46:46
I second this. Especially if they bought space for a collaborative ad made by the subreddit

You have a great opportunity to work for fiat but convert it to btc, imagine what you would save up for a car being able to retire on once you're done hs. 
I know people discourage mining. But I suggest you try it out, not to profit but to understand how it works, learn how to program in your spare time, and let your imagination take you places. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:55:34
Bitcoin users not affected.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:23:23
Depends on what you mine on, I was simply saying it's worth the time figuring out how mining pools work and just mine in one for like one block (you won't get much)
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:31:15
The miners rewards, block payouts, ect.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:23:16
Also it gives adopters an incentive to give discounts for BTC transactions. Allowing people to profit further from spending.
This what I find interesting because over time bitcoin seems to give people more and more reason to use it the longer they hold. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 06:35:49
try looking in %appdata%\bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:15:50
Well if you ever need any assistance please keep me in mind ;)
@_date: 2013-10-15 03:43:02
Unless you bought your miner with Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:56:53
It's not as simple as them saying "Hey let's do it!" and their finance department loads the client and gives people a wallet file.
There's tons valve has to sort out before accepting bitcoins.
 * Security-Keeping the bitcoins they receive secure.
 * PR-Accepting bitcoin is akin to promoting it, and they may have a different vision
 * liquidity-Valve is a business, they have little reason to accept bitcoin unless they can pay their employees/debts with bitcoins.
Though I'm really not saying it's a bad idea. If anything I'm sure a lot of people would consider getting paid in part bitcoin. 
Also Steam in a roundabout sense does accept bitcoin because you can buy steam games from people on [Games4Bitcoin](

I was under the impression mods could only change the CSS. I have no idea how one could do that within the subreddit.

Being able to truly safely store your money without it being eaten away by inflation is a big deal. You can be as responsible for your money as you want to be. And when done properly you have a very large assurance of safety.
Buying on localbitcoins isn't hard if you're in a big city. And my small savings from last April when I tried mining have gone up much more than a savings account that I have very little control over.
I think Bitcoin's largest advantages are not political, but practical. By the nature of an open source online currency you have a platform that anyone in the world is free to use.
Just my two bitcents.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:39:50
No error message, this is how offline addresses work, you can always generate new addresses to send to but it doesn't check if the address already "exists". So theoretically you could try bruteforcing until you generate an address that already has coins but the odds are unfathonaby low.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:34:07
Bitcoin is a lot of things to a lot of people. 
"Worth it" is in my opinion more of a personal choice. There a tons of advantages of bitcoin, and some drawbacks. Bitcoin like anything else, is just what you make of it.
Looking for a way to accept payment from people on your website? Bitcoins work. I'm no financial expert, but considering how many people are expressing interest in bitcoin, you're likely not losing out by buying more now.
Making predictions on if it will crash or go up in value is something for sorcerers and mathematicians, but make sure you know what you wanèt to get out of bitcoin. 
The bitcoin community seems to be not only growing. but also supportive many people are willing to help out new members and bring up to speed, but what I find more valuable is people telling others about  how to avoid common traps/scams. That's why I keep coming to this subreddit.

Because he's worried you're winning.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:40:18
Because BFL's business model was never to sell machines...
It was to grab a bunch of people's money to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:39:34
Bitcents are the answer. Bitcoin is very divisible, and honestly I think it might be better to leave them wanting this way.
Once they start with a little, your friend may get hungry for a whole bitcoin, investing more in the network, without the daunting 200+ "entry".

I would kill for a GTX anything right now, I built my pc just over 2 years ago with a raedon 6800 hd. The reason I'd want a GTX is for GPU rendering with [blender]( . Which my card doesn't support sadly, I really wish I built my pc after I found blender or vice versa.
I'm no where near great yet, but I like to think I'm okay at 3d modeling now.
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:27:04
Honestly, I did it more as a "to say I've done it" kind of thing, rather for any financial gain. Congrats on the .03 though!

Makes sense, I sit corrected.

I'm pretty much expecting the price to rise 100$ for the holidays 
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:49:46
I think everyone in the thread is ignoring one of the bigger risks. You say you guys don't know a lot about bitcoin. How did he buy them? Localbitcoins? Did they send bitcoins or give him a private key/wallet?
Just make sure you have those coins in a address that only he has ever had control over...
and back-up back-up backup. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:00:46
6 hours pffffttt...
Not in my Canada.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:34:07
I know it's easier, but wouldn't it be more efficient to receive bitcoins directly? I imagine that would be the goal in the long run.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:25:26
Ding Ding Ding! We have a winner! Who cares how great bitcoin is if we stop them from using it. This is why people should demand to have control over their software and hardware. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:05:03
I'm starting to learn how to code. Can you point me to any good resources on interacting with the Bitcoin network?
@_date: 2013-03-06 06:13:25
I've just heard about it recently too when I found a post in earlier today. Defconoi, has the right idea, as for your question.
 * [bitcoin wallet without installing anything](
 
 * [download guiminer](
 * Make sure your GPU (you'll definetly be wanting to mine on a GPU) drivers are updated.
 * register and join a group with the MinerGUI client, and go outside or something
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:59:35
As someone who plays WoW the forums are a very small fraction of the community interactions. 
"I'll quit if x does/doesn't happen" is very very common. My experience with the official forums is that people will pay 15$/mo to complain about a game they claim to hate.
As far as I'm concerned it would be more effective to promote btc to the youtubers who do lore/gameplay videos because usually their viewers actually enjoy the game and the presenters often talk to blizzard devs themselves. 
I'm gonna go write a comment on one of  Nobbel87's video's.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:13:44
Or woman.
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:37:40
I like the idea, you might want to check if this won't get  people banned. I know for instance if say you did this to g+1 someone's blog, it would negatively affect their SEO.
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:36:09
Yeah just send all your btc to my address, and we promise to give back change.
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:48:43
Thanks so much! I just woke up to see that and it made my day!
