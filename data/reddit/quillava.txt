Came here to confirm I [got one]( as well.
Common sense says never run any .jar or .exe files someone emails you! I hope no one falls for this, whatever it is.

Same. Website said "will take about 0 minutes" which I knew was probably an error, but I wasn't expecting to have to wait until the next day
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:17:34
Well that was quick. 4k with 2 weeks to spare
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:03:47
We already had a dip to 5800 over the weekend but I guess you missed it

Sorry, my bad. I bought at Coinbase when gox was ~1200. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:10:29
Thats what I was looking for, thanks
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:06:34
$155.55 USD
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:12:28
~$250 is the "return to normal" price. It won't get below 100
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:21:45
seriously, the "crash" set us back ~5 hours? Most everyone still has huge profits unless you bought at super high

You have 8 balls in your hand. All of them look alike. But one of the 8 balls is heavier then the other 7. You have a weight scale. What is the least number of times you can use the scale to figure out the answer?

No one smart will exchange BTC for paypal, because it is too easy for the buyer to tell paypal he didn't recieve anything, and they will reverse the transaction.

To add to what evildice said, I'd say the "real" price is between the lowest price someone is willing to sell a coin for and the highest someone is willing to buy it for.
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:02:22
Also if bitcoin drops to ~0, there are thousands of people just waiting to buy 999999999 coins to catch the second ride

I agree with this. Come in to a casino and prepared to lose money but dont? Cool, good deal.
Edit: This subreddit always rants about "unrealized gains" and "you aren't a millionaire until you cash in!", but somehow changed their mind on this topic?
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:38:29
"technically". There's nothing stopping you but chance.
However, there 2^160 possible addresses, which is one or two decimal points from the number of atoms on earth. ~~It's 10^39 times harder to generate a collision than to win the lottery~~ (edit: I have no idea why I'm trying to math this late. Lets just call it "impossible in the universe's lifetime")

Try looking at this 
I don't know how accurate it is, but it'll give you an estimate of how long it'll take to get a solo block. 
For reference, my not too expensive laptop GPU (AMD Radeon HD 8750M) gets 90MH/s, making my block generation time about 1000 years, or 2 cents per day (minus power costs).
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:24:18
Bought .7 at Coinbase also at an average of ~$250/BTC, we have the best timing ever, I think.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:07:44
We've had like 10 "return to normals" within the past few weeks. Nobody knows whats going to happen.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:29:29
Sorry guys, I caused this. I bought at 1200.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:39:28
              wow

and both have a "redeem karma" feature where they will give you a few cents based on how much karma you have.

Watch Gox for a crash, trade on other exchanges before everyone else watching Gox can trade. Theres a 20-30 second window where everyone goes to the other window to panic sell.
At least thats how I've done it

coinbase minimum purchase is a dime, there is no barrier to entry

You can. Wallets don't need to be generated to 'exist'. If someone sends some btc to 11HeLLoThis1sATestHows1tXXXWaQHPz, the blockchain remembers that forever, and whoever (somehow) finds (or randomly generates) the private key can use it.

Interesting, what program is this?

I once tried to photoshop every frame in a short video clip we filmed for a Video Production class in 10th grade. 
It was terrible
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:10:35
The price will either be at "the moon" in a few years or "zero". My bet is on a huge price within a few years so yes, "now" is always the best time.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:39:05
I'm in the same boat. Had to sell my 0.6 because I'm a poor person who needs money, and that $400 I made in two weeks was just delicious. Now I'm hoping it wont go up too high by the time I get more money to buy back in.
*please crash please crash please crash*

The reason I ask is because you are pretending to give away a bitcoin to someone who asks questions, so I did.

Basically. I brought my .1  up to .17 by trading on btc-e by just reacting faster than everyone else. Its still quite a gamble sometimes, but it worked for me.

Gee whiz! Thats enough for four pieces of gum!

The profit IS the value of the bitcoins. You don't need to convert BTC to USD in order to buy things. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:51:34


@_date: 2013-11-18 18:32:26
.7 here also. Fianlly worth enough to pay my rent (if I needed to use BTC), and I'm feeling richer than ever.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:02:00
Its no big deal. I've done my research and I'm in for the long term, I bought in at $200 a month ago and panic sold at $500 during the big dip, only to buy back in at 1200 (I actually needed the money so I don't regret it.) Honestly, owning BTC and watching the price go down a little bit is a lot less stressful than not owning and watching it skyrocket.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:25:36
Take a look at 
I've never used it, but you can buy basically any gift card with bitcoins. If you're looking to spend bitcoins like cash, this'll be your best bet
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:58:38
Bought .4 at $1200, and I'm hoping for a huge crash so I can buy more. No big deal.
