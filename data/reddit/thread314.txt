This is remarkably generous - good on you!
Can I suggest the [GIVE Program]( a charity run by the NGO I work for, Therapy Focus (in Western Australia). We work with people with disabilities, primarily kids but grown ups too. The GIVE program helps fund essential equipment, communication devices and other supports. I have seen this fund make *huge* changes for families, so much really life changing stuff (you can see a list of examples [here]( 
And a great thing about it is that Therapy Focus covers the costs of managing and administering the funds, so *every cent* donated goes directly to helping kids and families. 
At the moment we don't have an option for donating via BTC, but if you think it's worthwhile, I could chat to my bosses and have that set up today. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:41:50
Quick everyone, do more Google searches for Bitcoin!

Segwit is what the core devs want and it is what nearly the whole community wants. It has been painstakingly designed and exhaustively tested, thousands of man hours have been put it to it. 
Segwit will:
- Reduce transaction fees. 
- Remove Asic Boost 
- Allow lightning network, and thus solve issues with scalability. 
- Decrease transaction time. 
All of the above is in the interest of users, but not in the interests of a small group of powerful miners, so the miners have been blocking it, delaying, misleading and sabotaging it every step of the way. The main way that has been tried to implement it has been a miner activated soft fork, however particular miners have repeatedly blocked this from happening. ([Read this article]( for a more full story on this.).  It has become obvious that SegWit through a Miner Activated Soft Fork is simply not going to happen, so we are attempting a different method, which is a User Activated Soft Fork. There's more to it, obviously, but this is the ELI5. I would recommend reading up more on it, in the links I list in the original post. 
Until we resolve this standoff, the miners are milking over $1,000,000 in transaction fees *every day*, and really holding the currency back, so this is why many people get really passionate and worked up about this. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:33:13
I think this is a solid idea, and for an enterprising exchange, there is a fuckton of money to be made out of this. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:05:05
Go to an exchange, there are many good ones. Many recommend coinbase, or btcmarkets.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:10:59
I think you're asking the wrong question. The better question is, what is the argument *for* SegWit2x? I have seen no objective argument for it, which to me says they have ulterior motives. Stalling tactic, maintain Asicboost, who knows, but *something* Dodgey is going on there.
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:21:10
That's is a good point, but I think you miss mine. I'm not talking about raising awareness of Bitcoin in the broader community, I'm suggesting applying coordinated pressure to existing players to support BIP148.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:34:46
Or to get the chain one block longer, and then the entire legacy chain will be orphaned. A *huge* risk for uninformed users.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:49:22
What did I just watch?
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:18:29
Well sure, that makes sense. I really should learn to take cues from context.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:33:43
True that. And when people post the inevitable question (what is this whole bip148 thing?) be patient. Sure it's been asked and answered a million times, but people just finding out about it are precisely who we need to be recruiting.
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:19:47
That sounds frustrating. 
But if you support Segwit and BIP148, show it by contacting them! Without their customers they have nothing. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:17:15
What a pile of pretentious crop. I mean, I love bitcoin, but this is unsufferable.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:47:39
Best one I found is Let's Talk Bitcoin, but it's weird. The RSS feed appears to include about 4 different podcasts, most of which are kinda trash. But if you stick to LTB they're pretty solid. 
Also, if you're into podcasts, I highly recommend the audiobook fir The Internet of Money by Dominic Frisby. A good look at the history and origins of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:47:33
Huh, I see. Thanks for explaining, appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:35:44
I really do not. What actual announcements/news came out if the conference that could explain it? The Barry Silbert agreement, which was received as a joke by the community?
I think it had zero impact. While the real causes of the recent growth are impossible to ascertain, I think it has much more to do with Japan, BIP148 and mainstream media coverage.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:58:10
Can anyone explain what this moon thing is I keep hearing about?
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:54:35
Thank you, that's been my understanding too.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:29:51
If you have Bitcoin, this definitely affects you. 
This guides covers it all pretty well: 
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:25:40
If 90% don't know about uasf, I call that untapped market. Generating support is essential. You don't agree?
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:14:42
A lot of talk about the market and no talk about the technology.
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:11:21
Yeah, exactly. This is basically the same trick as Paul the Octopus.
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:10:04
True that. The only times the price matters are the day you buy it and the day when (if) you sell it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:31:07
Yeah, looking at their Twitter it looks like the website has had some issiesately, so given that this may not have been the optimal time to Target them. But still, all good. :)
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:53:47
Dude! Not cool, only Spartans can use that word. 
Not cool.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:30:17
Really? Lol, whoops thanks. :/
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:05:48
And we start all over again on a higher difficulty setting.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:50:43
I'm curious, did Alan have any commentary on the boom? I always appreciate his dry perspective.
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:03:18


Very much not so. Whether a user supports it or not, they run a very real risk of losing all their bitcoin if their exchange/wallet does not support bip148.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:03:03
You for real? You've made more than 70 comments in this subreddit in the past 12 hours and *I'm* the spammer?
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:27:37
I'm not expecting/wanting them to support bip148 instead of a legacy chain, I'm wanting them to commit to supporting and trading *both*.
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:56:36
Right? I'm glad someone else is seeing this too. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:32:41
Absolutely, you're right, demand probably wasn't the best choice of words. But as customers we can cast our vote by choosing where we take our business and letting them know why.
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:27:52
Clearly we disagree and that's fine. 
But I'm genuinely curious, can you tell me one concrete development that came out of the conference?
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:21:27
This is a story that will never go away. Everytime we reach an ath, some lazy journalist will do the math and call it news.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:36:04
I did! But I really didn't find much going on in there, it was pretty dead from what I could see. Was there something I was missing?
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:19:54
That is a actually a really solid strategy. I'll start doing this for sure, ta. :)
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:20:19
Wait, really? I was under the understanding that all you need is a wallet. Can you explain how I'm wrong?
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:12:57
Yeah, that is a terrible explanation. You either don't understand it or are intentionally misrepresenting it.
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:25:23
I think you either didn't read my previous post or didn't understand it. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:31:58


This author doesn't understand blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:53:49
It *doesn't* look like bubble? How so? To my eyes that is exactly what it looks like is happening here.
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:57:44
When you find yourself getting bored to see yet another post about a milestone being broken, this is a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:00:09
Desperate illl thought agreement with "82%" of the hashrate? A mysterious actor expending vast resources in an attempt to undermine bip148? Sounds like someone is scared.
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:41:12
Yeah, you'll be fine. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:16:48
Excuse me? Explain to me how having major wallets and exchanges all commit to supporting a bip148 chain won't help uasf?
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:12:44
I don't understand. Could you rephrase the question?
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:11:55
Fuck me you're condescending.
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:51:58
Yeah nahh it's about segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:03:08
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:58:58
That is actually really good advice, thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:07:29
I've read that running a node that does actually engage in transactions is pointless. Is this true?
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:33:49
You raise some good points, but:


This will never, ever happen. Many before you have tried very hard to reach consensus, and it has not worked, because the miners have incentive to maintain the status quo. The only solution to scaling is segwit, which means bip148. I highly recommend you read up on it and start signalling.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:28:48
Yeah, you have nothing to worry about, don't stress. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:11:29
That's not true, there have been 6 episodes since just June. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:35:23
What tool are you using here?
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:01:43


I don't know about that, I just think people think you aren't for real. I do see you have spent a *lot* of time trying to defend yourself. I'd say don't bother, you can't change the internet's mind.
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:14:16
You're a customer of BTC-E? You're not concerned?
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:27:53


Ha, sure. 
Can I ask, do you literally do this every time you buy something with fiat? How does this exchange usually go down?
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:57:35
A good article, but I'm not convinced Schnorr signatures will be effective against spam. Fees are charged per byte, not per transaction, so if you still wanted to spam the network you would just spam many smaller transactions, and it would cost the same amount.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:05:07
You will be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:13:28
You are correct, it is not guaranteed. Personally I believe the odds of the miners reneging at this point are quite low. You can disagree with me on this, that is fine. 
My comment was intended to give some clarity for uninformed readers, so there are necessarily many details that I glossed over. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:28:44
Dude fuck off I saw him first ;)
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:37:37
Are you implying the growth in price was caused by the conference? Seriously?
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:54:56
I do not think this is correct. At the moment of the fork, both chains will be working from the same block, so difficulty will be at the same level for both. As each chain progresses and mines blocks at different rates, only then will this slowly change the difficulty. There is a significant lag on this (by design). 
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:08:31
Shit, this seems big.
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:57:18
Looks like you were just in time, u/thesilentwitness
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:20:35
So I've tackled your tutorial a couple times, and each time I get stuck at the Docker part (I'm running on Windows). 
Here's where I'm stuck:
"use the bowhead/create_docker script or create it via Dockers kitematic app, an alternative to kitematic I like is Portainer by calling it as:"
I have tried running the script in the bowhead folder, I have tried fiddling about in Kitematic, and I have tried entering the commands you listed into Command Line, none of it seems to have helped. Can you suggest what I could try?
Thanks in advance, and thanks for taking the time and care to put together such an awesome resource. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:37:07
You, I like you. 
*But* I'm all for empassioned posting on Reddit, but what tangible things can we do? Other than running a full node and signalling.
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:13:46
No no, I mean the meme specifically. I mean, I live the little guy, but he is getting reposted like crazy. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:27:04
I like Let's Talk Bitcoin and Bitcoin Uncensored.
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:55:20
Wait, seriously? The blockchain does not use a lot of bandwidth...
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:22:08
Yeah, that's what I'm worried about. Honestly, it might be a safer bet to wait for BCC to become live, trial it with a small amount and then do a larger quantity it it succeeds. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:56:46
Yeah. I read half of it and then it seemed clear he wasn't going to refer to hodling or moon, so I got bored and stopped reading.
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:33:27
There has got to be a law of diminishing returns on this guy. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:33:23
Good post. Far too many users are ignorant of the risk they are at if their exchange doesn't support it.
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:31:57
What is this trying to advertise? And why do they say min. for million?
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:19:12
There's a better opportunity than simply cashing out? Do share
@_date: 2017-07-02 00:16:31
I feel like I'm missing something. Why is there so much hate for this guy?
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:05:28
So, essentially, we should all start running a node to cast our vote?
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:36:28
Absolutely, good on you.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:45:05
Fuck I wanted that to exist. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:44:22
Writing a comment in support of BCC is meaningless. If you really believe in it then put your Bitcoin where your mouth is. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:39:01
For those confused by all the jargon: the success of BIP91 means that SegWit is now locked in. It means that BIP148 and August 1 will pass with no effect, and that SegWit will be active from August 10. Read [this article]( for a great explanation of the details of all this. 
SegWit is a change to how Bitcoin works that fixes some key bugs in the protocol, that makes mining fairer by disabling ASIC Boost and that allows for some amazing scaling solutions. 
While SegWit has had very broad and passionate support from most users and developers, certain mining groups have blocked it's implementation and launched a pretty concerted campaign against it. This has lead to an increasingly bitter and toxic division within the community. 
TL:DR: Today is a wonderful and important day for Bitcoin: both the protocol and the community. We should all be very proud of this achievement. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:55:56


@_date: 2017-07-25 22:40:38
I can't help but feel there's a pattern there somewhere, if only we could spot it. :/
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:03:20
Yeah, here's to hoping that all settles down a little, and doesn't just get redirected to the next contentious issue (the 2mb hard fork in November?). 
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:26:53
This really doesn't have a lot to do with Bitcoin... But fuck me it was interesting.
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:07:57
See this comment I made the other day. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:04:56
[Ohh, sure. ](
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:28:22
"law that will require permission from financial authorities before trading, issuing, depositing or doing any kind of business with the so-called crypto currencies" 
Ha, ha, yeah good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:25:58
Thank you for addressing these points, and I love your attitude to the original author. 
I'm very interested to come on board with Prism, but the 100% maximum profit is something that concerned me, as often growth in cryptocurrency a can be within orders of magnitude. I didn't entirely explain how my maximum profit could be 200%, if Shapeshifter are only matching my investment. Could you expand on this a little for me? 
Also, could/would there be an function in the smart contract that would automatically close the contract if it were to ever reach the maximum possible profit margin?
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:51:05
Why, though? 
And also, thanks for not pointing out the stupid typo. :/
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:51:18
Wait, what happened to Gavin and john? And who are Gavin and john?
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:50:09
I mean the number of transactions per second the protocol can process.
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:02:13
I'd love to say that hey, you should really present both sides of the argument blah blah blah, but it really is that clear cut.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:09:54
I can't tell if you're being serious, but I was not, thus the smiley Winky face. Just a joke is all.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:41:28
This exchange in particular? Or do you mean exchanges in general?
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:07:42
This would protect against rootkits?
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:52:51
No, Chris de Rose on his own. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:17:04
Karma? Is that a new alt? Does it have an ICO coming up?
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:34:04
That is a very valid point, thanks. 
What about if I rephrase my original question: what are the best arguments against maximilism for crypto-currency of some description?
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:46:47
Really? You think the *survival* of Bitcoin is dependant upon Lightning Network?
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:04:18
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:06:59
So true. A lot of confirmation bias in action here.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:35:36
Love the articles, exactly what I been looking for. I started with part 1, but it sounded like you were iffy on whether it would work on windows. Can I follow this on windows?
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:44:34
I was not aware of that, thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:49:51
Holy shit! Bitcoin is dead! Again!
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:07:06
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:44:59
I ask mainly because Andreas Antonopolos and Chris DeRose have both expressed ambiguity.
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:50:47
Litecoin has segwit, and that hasn't made every other altcoins obsolete, so no. The alts (or the good ones) have different features, and for that reason are in no danger.
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:37:55
Then how is this any better than a paper wallet? I can get a seed from any number of wallet apps.
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:55:49
Not entirely correct. Electric uses its own seed phrase system, so you could save the electric software to future proof yourself, or use an app which uses bip39, which is more standardised. 
Also, from a security standpoint having your seed phrase in two email accounts is *terrible*. Highly advise against this.
@_date: 2017-06-23 12:52:31
I actually wonder if he still follows it all. I suspect he may despair at all the politics.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:44:12
There is something to stop them, cryptography. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:52:33
Fuck me that is patronising.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:13:08
Yes, but these new crypto currency is are superior in *so* many ways. Can you explain how in an open market the superior product will not eventually dominate?
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:25:10
Yeah, wtf is he even talking about. :/
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:34:37
The Internet of Money was a good entry level look at the history and some of the tech of the coin.
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:13:15
I would be very cautious posting things like this, and handling the wallet file in this way. You could definitely make yourself a target for hacking. Honestly, a post like this is practically an invitation. Bitcoin bought back when price was much lower? A user who is naive about bitcoin and security? Be careful.
@_date: 2017-06-30 23:09:30
Anyone know a better alternative? Honestly, I could never get it to work right in the first place anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:22:09
He paid to have people murdered. I really do not understand the hero worship for this guy.
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:20:44
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:09:33
If you have the time and energy, Glacier Protocol is the Gold standard, imo.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:09:56
This sounds like rubbish to me.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:43:41
I absolutely agree, but see it as an opportunity. If Bitcoin doesn't get segwit, Litecoin could explode. So invest now, while others haven't realised this yet.
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:50:13
My bad, I stand corrected.
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:33:51
Bitfinex has not, they have since come out and explained that report was incorrect.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:00:11
I don't think you get it.
@_date: 2017-06-04 23:47:49
I know. Enough arguing and grand standing (from both sides). Time to let the market resolve this.
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:56:18
That was the dumbest fucking thing I have ever seen on this sub.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:43:16
Isn't that kind of chicken and egg-y? Many say high fees/long transaction times are keeping away many users...
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:34:59
Main example I'm thinking of is Andreas Antonopolos. I *think* Nick Szabo may have said it at some point too, but I'm less certain of this. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:06:32
I do, yes. cleared it up for me very nicely. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:39:17
Ohh, I should have been clearer: I mean crypto-currencys as a whole are superior to fiat currencies, not that other crypto currencies are superior to bitcoin specifically. 
To clarify, I guess what I'm really asking is what are the arguments against crypto-currency maximilism. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:05:47
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:27:50
And why? Other than yaay that'd be nice?
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:05:07
Are you saying we jump ship to litecoin? Or that litecoin having segwit somehow makes it inevitable for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:46:47
Really? Can you link this to me? Honestly, I think futures are the best chance for bip 148. If it established value before August 1, then miners will commit.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:43:58
Yeah. I'll admit the sudden decrease in the MemPool is weird, but it seems a little tin-foil hatty to say people were spending millions every day just to win an argument. But hey, anyone with a compelling case, I'm happy to be proven wrong. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:43:01
I can understand where you are coming from, the issues are not simple and they are presented with such vitriol on both sides it is hard not to be skeptical of it all. 
My advice, read up, and make your own decision. It's not easy, but all the info is out there. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:39:19


So I should start to publish deliberately incorrect tutorials on how to set up a paper wallet?

What do you mean by this?
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:54:29


You are mistaken. All public keys are known already by the by blockchain.

Thank you for your thorough explanation. 
So, have I understood this right: Segwit2x and SegWit are technically the same, the only difference is the signal is communicated in a different way (a different bit)? And with this new change announced, the signalling can be merged, so people signalling SegWit and Segwit2x will be combined and thus the 95% thresh hold will be easily met?

I've heard this before, but don't understand it. Can you recommend a book/article to educate me on this topic?
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:44:16
This... This is how a business should handle it's errors. You just earned my custom.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:36:50
Do not use this, fingerprints are not secure. You an have good security, or you can have easy security, but you can't have both.
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:00:55
Yeah, I do too. :(
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:05:52
Confidence is great but you don't spell out how. Being a good idea does not guarantee it's success.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:03:47
More than users, we need miners.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:07:45
That is a very good article. More than ever you have me convinced that LN is what is going to change cryptocurrency from a niche cult economy, to a completely viable fiat-alternative. 
As you seem to know what you're talking about, what will the situation with privacy be with offchain transactions on LN? I presume improved from Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:46:03
What are some other scaling solutions offered by SegWit? Other than the block size increase?
@_date: 2017-06-04 23:46:47
You're right, I think still birth is the biggest risk. And I think to avoid we need *some* exchange to run a futures market.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:14:46
Correct, no one died, but he did not know this. He believed people were being killed and was paying for this to be done. That is not something you can handwave away. 
Have you read the transcript? It's chilling how casual he was with it.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:30:32
I think cast a wide net, big players and small players. We'll have more chance of influencing small players, and if small players join then big players will be more likely to. You don't agree?
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:18:14
What are you on?
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:57:28
And cancer too, right? I'm *pretty* sure Bitcoin will cure cancer.

Fuck me, entitled much? A quick search will turn up 10 places where this has been answered already.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:12:06
Am I understanding this right? Their new alt-coin will have *no* block size limit? ��
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:37:26
Could someone ELI5 this for me? I thought Segwit2x was going to operate on a different bit, and thus was fundamentally different...
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:39:51
Onion routing + LN? Fuck me that is intriguing. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:49:31


Or to phrase it another way, you're too much of a dumb ass to understand. If you're asking for people to explain something to you, don't open by insuring them.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:40:59
But as I see it, none of the alts have solved the problem of scalability either. They may have larger blocks (a superficial gain) and less demand on their network. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:33:44
Thanks for clarifying. I just recall a throwaway comment you made in one of your videos, but I'm very glad to be corrected. 
If it has your vote of confidence, it has mine.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:15:11
Fucking hell, settle down.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:11:47
That's more an opinion than an argument. Can you expand on *why* you think that to be the case?
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:57:57
This. Voting with our business is one of the best ways we as users can have an impact right now.
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:00:41
Ahhh, I see I see. So there's two choices for miners: Firstly, do they signal Segwit or not, and secondly: do they mine their next block on the chain which UASF nodes approved or on the chain that non-UASF nodes approved. 
This is a shame, I wish it worked as I originally thought... but thank you for explaining it to me. :)
