This is literally what [interac e-transfers are in Canada]( One click to email/text a money transfer to another person. The other person one-click deposits it into their account after providing the password. That's it. That is *literally* it.
Instant. No middleman. Extremely low fees (1$ for up to $1000 paid by the sender. Free to receive). Safe.
