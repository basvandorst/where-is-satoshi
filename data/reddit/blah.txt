No it won't. Decentralization is pointless if nobody wants to use it, or if only a select few elite can afford to use it.
A decentralised bitcoin that nobody wants wouldn't be successful, would it?
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:50:13
Lucky we're only talking about 2MB then, huh? (or 4MB with segwit / 8MB if segwit is attacked)
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:22:34
We do it again if technology costs decrease sufficiently.
So long as decentralisation/distribution is maintained, we can do it.
If in the future for some reason tech becomes expensive, internet speeds don't improve, and hdd capacity doesn't increase, then we wouldn't do it.
If tech becomes better and cheaper, then we would.
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:00:57


This is in direct contradiction to the comments discussing segwit and why it should be approved: i.e. Segwit won't really be 4MB, it'll only ever get to a max of 2MB in real world usage.
This sort of blatant lying is why nobody trusts this sub.

Actually, we don't. This misconception needs to be corrected.
We need only enough people running full nodes to maintain decentralisation and distribution.
I'm not sure what that figure is, but it isn't "as many as possible". That's foolish. There's a good figure that it should be maintained at, say a well distributed 1000 across the world. So long as it's maintained above a certain minimum it will be very secure.

True, but block size decisions should be carried out with no regard to side chain solutions. If block sizes are artificially limited to make side chain solutions more attractive we are in big trouble.

A few weeks ago this sub literally started a boycot campaign against Xapo.
This kind of behaviour, back and forth bullshit, is completely fucked. The behaviour has been shameful.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:00:26
The shit that gets upvoted here is ridiculous. If bitcoin volume is so centralised in a bunch of peoples hands it doesn't fucking matter if there's "capital flight". Bitcoin is fucked if that's true.
Spoilers - it isn't true. This post is just fucking stupid.

reddit and twitter are just about the worst places to have bitcoin discussion. actually, scratch that. they're second worst. The worst is a trollbox.

We've six years of discussion and no action. No wonder people are pissed.
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:28:18
I thought this sub banned "alt coin discussions"?
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:49:36
I've not been convinced that segwit is safe and acceptable, so no, I'm not going to use it until I am personally convinced. That's the good thing about bitcoin, I decide how I  personally operate.
And no, it's not a blocksize increase, it's an introduction of block weight.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:53:05


The bigger question is, why hasn't a blocksize increase been tested for years. It's been talked about for 6 years now. I would've thought that was ample time to do any and all testing.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:24:36

Ok, let's play devil's advocate for a second, if we go with this system. Those engineers need to be able to adequately explain their reasoning and convey to the people it affects why they are doing what they are doing.

opt in replay protection protects the vast majority of users, and considering the idea is to continue bitcoin, not create an altcoin, it would make sense.

What amount of time does that take? I've read 14 days.
My 2 experiences where this has occurred was only about 2 hours between initial tx, and redo.
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:05:07
Isn't there a legitimate concern with segwit still? I don't blame people for being cautious in the uptake. If there ever is a problem with segwit in the future, and you've used a segwit transaction, your coins, regardless of if you've sent them back to a non-segwit address, are at risk.
You might think it's overly cautious, but when we're talking about bitcoin it pays to be cautious. I personally am waiting it out before ever doing any big segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:47:42
Oh yeah, I totally want to "attack" something where I've got a large storage of value (◔_◔) 
@_date: 2017-10-31 08:31:40


Yes. That's my point. I make a transaction to myself (effectively another person) to cancel the first one.
This occurred during the period of full blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:28:49


Segwit is irreversible though, even if you don't use it, in the highly unlikely scenario that there is some flaw/fault/error/problem with segwit, it cannot be reversed. That would be a utterly catostrophic outcome for bitcoin.
Luckily this doesn't seem to be the case, and there isn't really any known issues with segwit at this time.
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:03:08
Nobody used litcoins segwit. It never had mass testing.

Take a read: 
Essentially, it's written favourably towards B1X, instead of being neutral between b1x and b2x.
The terms state that b2x tokens can be valued at zero, whilst an equivalent term is not applicable for b1x.
Anyone betting using bitfinex's system should know that the terms are not equal per token, and thus you can see the explanation for the price difference.

I don't "shill". I write my opinions down because I hold bitcoin and want it to be successful. I call out bullshit where I see it regardless of who's doing it. I post in rbtc and rbitcoin pretty much equally. My karma breakdown on my profile shows higher karma in rbitcoin than rbtc. So how about you stop just stop trolling and spreading misinformation and dissent.

The reason for the community split and the terrible state bitcoin is in at the moment is solely due to those two toxic individuals having too much control and influence over the bitcoin ecosystem.

This is getting so stupid. I frequent both subs. Neither sub wants to destroy bitcoin. Both subs fucking own bitcoins. They want bitcoin to succeed, they just disagree on how it's going to succeed. Stop trying to divide and destroy the community, in all fucking honesty, there isn't that great a divide between people. It's pretty much two sides in disagreement about how to proceed, and a huge bunch of assholes blowing it all out of proportion.

*edit2: found the filter phrase, it's weird, i'll delete my original post since it's below almost in it's entirety and it doesn't matter*
I've called wright out plenty of times. I've called Ver out for supporting wright and giving a platform to him. I call out anyone I have a problem with, which includes a subset of the developers, and includes people involved in 2x, it includes people involved in bitcoin cash, it includes people who run bitcoin websites, exchanges, forums. I call out everything if I see it and it bothers me enough. What you linked is a literally true post title with data sources linked and one of the data sources is someone I hate with a passion. Calling it propaganda is beyond words.
I simply own bitcoin. That is my entire motivation. The fact that I own bitcoin. If I see bullshit. I call it.

This kind of bias on what is supposed to be the main bitcoin point of information is very troubling. I fear that there's too great a centralised power over bitcoin in the form of community forum, information point, and development. This is really troubling.

There honestly isn't any good reason for or against. It'd be fine either way. The truth is the whole thing is an extension of the power battle going on at the moment for "control" of bitcoin (in different senses).

The question then becomes, why weren't 2MB blocks incorporated and planned years ago, so their implementation wouldn't cause such controversy? Why aren't 2MB blocks even in the plan at the moment for say, a 2 year from now activation? Why was this talked about and nothing done for 6 years?
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:06:10
a fatal flaw with P2SH would not be as catastrophic, as it's use is not widespread and the damage would be contained locally.

Ok, sure, but the core team are literally saying and acting the same way Hearn did in the past. If 2X goes through, core have stated that they will quit, just like hearn did, and many contributors have stated that they think if 2X goes through, bitcoin is dead. If that happens will you behave the same way to the huge group of core devs?
I feel like this posting is just trying to create a villian for users to rally against. It's shitty behaviour any way you slice it.
Hearn really believed in bitcoin and really contributed a lot. His vision diverged from what was pushed by others and he stood up for what he believed in and actually put his money where his mouth was. And now people are villifying and making fun of the guy.
This toxicity needs to end.

How about we stop dividing the community, and recognise that it isn't an "attack". It's two sides disagreeing on how best to move a project forward.

This is a pretty disgusting post, and the comments are typically disgusting.
Remember about a week or two ago, when it was stated by a number of core developers that if Segwit2X was successful, they'd all quit?
Yeah, so, imagine if that happens, are you all going to immediately turn on them, laugh at them, call them "[tards]( Call them "[drama queens]( Call them "[butthurt](

Alright. Think of it like this: There's a horse race with two horses, both horses are equal in performance, in a race, they would most likely finish at the same time.
Now, there's a bet on for which horse will win the race. HOWEVER, the catch is that horse # 1 is being transported from far away, on a short schedule. Horse # 1 might not even make it to the race track on time for the race.
THUS. The bets reflect this, even though the horses are equal in performance, bets would be something like:
Horse # 1 - 5:1 odds
Horse # 2 - 1.1:1 odds
Do you understand now?
