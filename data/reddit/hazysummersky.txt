Please do! It's purely what it should be now - discussion of tech relevance. You can read all our guidelines and our new transparency policy in the sidebar. What happened was a travesty. And we're open to any suggestions or critique you may have. It''s appreciated. I was brought in to help through the new mods recruitment process (what I do) and we selected judiciously. New mod team is solit. Where it was run like a personal fiefdom, it is now operated like a pretty respectable startup, with potential. Next step is regaining default status, but we have to earn back that trust.
@_date: 2014-09-28 12:11:00
Hey mod there! There is no rift between our subs, at least as far as we can see. Perhaps in the past, but as said those responsible for the clusterfuck are gone, and new mod team of 22 (17 new) now adhere strictly according to rules and transparency policy you'll find in our sidebar. So apologies for the impression of any rift, it ain't so! Hellz, I'm invested in bitcoin, subscribed to since forever.
@_date: 2014-09-29 11:03:35
No worries, and sorry, if I'd considered those who'd unsubscribed wouldn't know, I'd have spoken up sooner.

Your guess is as good as mine. As far as I can tell, just powerfeulled delusional mods filtering out topics that annoyed them. Including the redditor with most combined karma on reddit. They were forced to surrender mod status. Here's a list (may not be complete) of terms that had been autobanned:

Yes! Won't happen again - promise.. We did try to let everyone know, but if people had left the sub, well that wouldn't have worked. If I'd realised sooner, I'd have let y'all know sooner. Anyways, please submit away, agreed it'st abongst the most exciting current innovations in tech - I believe a gamechanger.
@_date: 2014-09-28 07:58:02
mod here. It's clearly a tech-related article of interest and import. Bitcoin-related submissions are more than welcome, though may not gain such traction amongst non -early adopters. I'd guess whilst many have heard of bitcoin, they've used PayPal. Either way, if great to see bitcoin getting attention, and the response shows a pretty awesome  supportive attitude towards bitcoin from the subreddit/reddit community, even if many don't fully understand it! 
Just to acknowledge there was a time when [was autodeleting bitcoin posts]( along with a host of other tech-related topics. We had a few activist mods who had unilaterally added search terms to the automoderator. Sub [lost default status and got internationally shamed.]( Mods were ousted, and there are a carefully vetted new mod team in place now, with a raft of new procedures put in place to ensure such asshattery won't happen again. Cryptocurrency posts most welcome.

No worries, it's a long road to win back trust, especially when those who unsubscribed can't hear of the seachange, because they don't visit the sub. I was furious as everyone else when the story broke. No idea what the dickmods were thinking..reddit powerusers seeing reddit as their own fiefdom, like some Digg mark II. Was happy to be part of the solution when called up to serve. I can promise, never again.

Previously from Oz you'd have to transfer funds to a bank in Czech Republic, which incurred ~10% fees, and buy from there. This at least is simpler, if still extortionate.

[The Landlord's Game]( of which Monopoly is a direct derivation, was originally developed by a woman named Lizzie Magie, an economic progressive who wanted ‘not only afford amusement’ to players but to educate them about how 1900s economics was unfairly weighted in favour of the landlord.  
@_date: 2016-06-10 13:42:25
Those handling fees are extortionate, precluding them is supposed to be one of the benefits of bitcoin.

It's rather obvious confidence that it's better is not common understanding, it's at ~$628 to USD vs. ~$4005 to USD, and ultimately confidence in a currency is all that matters. You can carry on arguing what you think is a better idea, but it's meaningless in the face of what the market agrees.

Not stealing from others, *mining* the coins from new blocks. As I understand it the mining crunches existing computational processing power. Quantum computing could change that game - you process exponentially quicker qubit by qubit. Do first adopters not fleece all new bitcoins from existing blocks? I understand the difficulty changes on recent performance, but surely it's a window of opportunity, that necessarily locks out everyone else, no? Processing power through bitcoin history has largely run linearly by processor, built by building networks. Quantum technology breaks that model, does it not? And anyone who has that if/when it is available has a window to scoop up, if they could add extra, before anyone without could adopt, if they could access the tech. Techwise it's been a relatively level paying field tech-access-wise thus far, but would the exponetial calculation speed not be an issue for the original model of mining? Would it not be like enabling god mode?
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:26:29
Alrighty, I did search 'bitcoin quantum', contemplated adding mining, asumed it'd come up in first search..but you're right as to checking without asking. Nothing satisfactorily answered the question though.

Y'see, this is another train of thought. I just find it weird that there are so many camps as to why with something we are investing in. Surely we should have it settled. Imagine if house prices suddenly quadrupled, then halved a month later. We'd figure out precisely what happened prety quick. With bitcoin it all comes across as opinions and predilections..
@_date: 2016-05-28 17:03:15
When I say spike, I mean that bit where it goes up, not that bit where it goes down. I understand what happened with it going down, but that's not what we're discussing.
@_date: 2016-05-28 16:55:57
Why would that make it go up? Surely that'd crash confidence, not make it more appealing..
@_date: 2016-05-28 17:14:59
Thanks, that kinda makes sense..not having been keyed in at the time. Birthing pains I guess..
@_date: 2016-05-28 16:52:12
The question was why the spike?
@_date: 2016-05-28 17:08:57
Howso? I'm asking why it went from low to $1K+, not why it collapsed, that bit I get, but why did it go from zero to hero? I'm sorry if you find it hard to understand the question, I'm really trying to state it as plainly as possible.
@_date: 2016-05-28 15:39:34
I don't give much credence to Mr Greenspan, he's admitted his own failings after the 2008 debacle, and if he was left-footed about the one econmy he was supposed to be the clueyest cat about, I'm not going to respect a throwaway line about an economy he's never shown any understanding of.

Mt Gox suspended trading in Feb 2014, which is unrelated to the 2013 spike. Mebbe the crash, but still my question is why the spike?
@_date: 2016-05-28 16:01:51
Yeh, I got in at around $750/1Ƀ, but eh, long term ivestment.
@_date: 2016-05-28 15:41:07
That doesn't answer the question. What suddenly injected such confidence into the market? 
@_date: 2016-05-28 16:29:25
Still doesn't explain the sudden spike then sudden drop, albeit to halfway between starting point and peak.
