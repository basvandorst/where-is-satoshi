What current or future technological checks/balances/levers within bitcoin could allow such as an organisation to operate in a more transparent way than a traditional central bank?   
Maybe the hodlers have some kind of multisig shared amongst them, or timelocked transactions to stop panic selling?

Do you think Bitcoin will always be volatile against fiat? If not what technological or economic developments going to make it less volatile? Is it just because we are in some kind of pre-moon price discovery phase? Or is it due to whales who have figured out how to manipulate the price?

HODALL because I am not smart enough to know how to tell the difference in viability between the different forks and the original.

I am not an expert investor and I am not interested in guessing when prices are going to change short term, much happier to just hodl on for the ride long term rather than trying to predict short term movements.

On that topic, make sure you use protection. HIV is much more prevalent in some parts of Africa than in much of the west due to lack of medicine and a host of other reasons.

Interested in people's opinion as to whether  the lightning network will actually compete with credit/debit cards for people making small purchases. What are the variables that might make this future more or less like to drive adoption?

Fun fact, it's called pound cost averaging here at least it was when I took a financial planning course a few years ago.

Apologies for the noob questions.  
What are the incentives for users to run lightning network nodes?   
I assume they earn fees for processing transactions?   
Will those fees be enough to cover costs?   
How are those fees decided?  
 What are the barriers to entry to run a node. Do you need to be BTC rich?  
Is it only every going to be used for small transactions (coffee etc) or do you think it will be used for larger purchases?   
If so how large and how far are we buyers and sellers from feeling comfortable using the lightning network to buy a iphone, a new laptop or a tesla etc?
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:28:39
Yes it is much more volatile than most other assets, I assume because the market is still relatively immature so it doesn't take a lot to move the price a fair amount. The upside is that it creates opportunity to ride the coaster up, but the ride down can be bumpy and can sometimes be steeper than expected. So far though, it has always recovered (and looks well on its way to it's previous highs despite very little mainstream coverage.)
@_date: 2019-06-12 23:09:14
Consider it a cheap lesson?
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:22:29
I expect that this latest recovery will greatly increase people's confidence that while there may be a dramtic pull back in value somewhere in the future, Bitcoin is robust enough that it will not collapse as a result. This in turn should gradually reduce the volatity in price.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:32:35
I wonder if lots of people only buy or sell once they have heard sufficient messaging from their peers and news articles that buy or selling is a good idea. The problem is that that critical mass is usually a sign of an impending movement of price in the opposite direction!

It's crazy to me that we are already as close to $77,000 as we are with bitcoin no where near the scale of the dollar.

In the dim and distant past Chinese merchants invented their own form of paper money from records of debts called Jiaozi. People began trading these and before you know it they became massive more popular than the official currency. China eventually outlawed their issuance and began issuing their own official Jiaozi.

Newbie here: Are there reasons why Bitcoin seems to be so much more volatile than other assets/currencies? Is the bitcoin ecosystem missing a particular financial instrument that produces relative stability in the long term, or is there something fundamentally different about about bitcoin that it is naturally volatile? Or is it not really that volatile?

Are any countries known to be stockpiling Bitcoin? Would seem to be a sensible strategy to protect against SHTF type meltdown of the financial system that you would think at least one government would dedicate some mining rigs to the task.
@_date: 2019-05-17 00:12:12
I think the repeated big final 'this is it this time' bust and seemingly innevitable recovery of bitcoin will eventually innoculate the population to the worry that they have lost everything when the market drops. People will start to realise if they just hold on it's seems to recover. Eventually we will have less volatity as a result, as people will be less likely to sell at the first signs of trouble, and the price should find some new equilibrium.

Amazon act as a platform for third party sellers who could have interfered with the device. What's worse, Amazon mix stock in their fulfilment warehouses, so you could have purchased from a seller you trust, and had your order filled with stock from a bad actor.

While this story may be  a stretch, I wouldn't be surprised if nation states has begun to build up reserved of bitcoin as a hedge against a SHTF moment.

So google says there is a max of 1,555,210 kg of gold in the world  (not all of it already mined, and some of it not accessible i guess) what value does the current stock of BTC need to reach to exceed the value of gold.

Because when i bought a modest number of bitcoin at about $10 a pop, i told my friends about my pretty inconsequential experiment. Now they have increased in apparent value, they were all getting very excited about the idea and checking the price regularly and asking how much i had made. I don't like the idea of people knowing of how much i have, especially if they were to rise even further in value, so i decided to crystallize my gains, in their minds at least, and pretend i had cashed out last week. I have been getting sympathetic pep talks since then.

True, i assume the costs would need to be passed on to the users in the forms of fees. I wonder what level of fees the market would bear in return for backing from a solid, reputable insurer, probably not enough to fund the scheme at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:14:29
Is there any move to create some kind of voluntary Bitcoin insurance scheme for exchanges/other business that hold large amounts of bitcoin (perhaps involving maintaining some standard of independently verified security certification)? Are there fundamentals that stop this kind of thing from being a possibility?

Just looking back through some old threads, how has the last few weeks affected your view on BTC long term value? Do you think this is a short term spike or do you see it going higher than the $2000 or so level you mentioned?
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:34:47
We have all been burned reacting to the first sign of bad news. One of the things i have had to accept about myself is that i am NOT a good day trader, in previous crashes i have managed to lose about 30% of my bitcoins by trading at the wrong time. I seem to call the market incorrectly 90% of time, so i am in it for the long haul now. My coins are in a paper wallet in a safe place where i cant do any more damage.
