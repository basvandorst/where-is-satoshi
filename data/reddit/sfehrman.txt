Fair enough. I would have to agree their website Chat is useless there is never anyone available. They need to remove it if they aren't going to use it. 
I have had the best luck when contacting them using Hashtalk.org
I can't guarantee this isnt a quick cash grab but they have been around for a little while, not just a brand new start up.

I find it funny you expect some kind of guarantee on your purchase. There are thousands of companies that have a product and they claim it is a miracle product and next thing you know they are out of business because the product was junk. Sure you are thinking I still physically have the junk product, where I don't physically have the hashlet. Which is true, but what good is being able to hold a junk product that doesn't work as advertised, you might as well throw it in the trash.
This isnt like putting your money into a Bank Savings account that is government backed. Of course there is risk when you are talking about a crypto currency. What if you purchased a stock and then the company tanks your stock could be worthless. They firmly believe the Hashlet will be an amazing profit that will ROI for everyone, but they cant control the coins, they could all crash and be worthless.
I have purchased Miners and Hashlets from them. Have I made ROI? No, I keep reinvesting a lot of it right now. Will I be mad if it all goes downhill and I lose the thousands I have, hell yes I will be. BUT I dont expect any kind of guarantee from them, it is the risk I am taking mining coins. If you dont want the risk leave your money in the bank.
