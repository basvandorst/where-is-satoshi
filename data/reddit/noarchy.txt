That may indeed be the case, but taxes are also a reality. You can roll the dice and try to avoid them, or you can pay them now and try to find other ways of making change, in time.

Many people dump religion and substitute the state for similar functions. Religion probably shouldn't get a disproportionate amount of crap, compared to statism.

I don't recall signing or consenting to that contract.

If the bitcoin market gets big enough (or is it already?), might we see a kind of insurance to protect bitcoin accounts in case of theft?

I wish I could upvote this point more than once.
Just as there has been an effort to create a decentralized currency, other areas of the economy need a similar treatment, where possible. Otherwise, things are still too vulnerable to government meddling.

Cash will be on its way out, if governments continue some emerging trends. Italy put a [cap on cash transactions]( And then there was this news from Louisiana, where [cash was banned]( in sales of second-hand goods. The bill was signed into law in [August 2011](

That actually sounds great, to me. I wouldn't necessarily fear that.
