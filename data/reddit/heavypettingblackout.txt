He claims to have some dead man's switch setup to release some allegedly interesting information if he's not released. I hope we get to find out what it is.

I don't want him to die. I just want the timer on his thing to run out and deliver the payload.

Sure there is. Each bitcoin would just be more expensive.

If the price went to $0.01 almost everybody would quit mining except for just a few people, for which it would remain profitable because they would be mining the next block so frequently. There is no price floor that exists as a result of the cost of mining.

You could make some percussion like a snare be binary. Hit on the beat is 1, no hit is 0. Then add accompaniment. Might not sound too spastic.

The inferrence is that if the top 10% are mostly buying, they must be buying from the bottom 90%.

Honest question: How does rising dificulty lead to price decline?

The 6.15 meme is dumb, guys
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:02:47
Seriously, I went to the bank a few years ago to withdraw about $9k in cash to pay for a used car. The people at the bank acted like it was a big deal and said I should have called first. Wtf? No, just give me some of my money when I ask for it, per the terms of our agreement.
@_date: 2019-10-12 13:30:18
If everyone's planning to sell after the halving, won't the price drop?
@_date: 2019-12-20 23:05:49
Haha. If you have a coinbase account, you have a coinbase pro account, silly.
You are a sad, angry little man.

No sarcasm, the man's middle name is actually Jesus.
@_date: 2019-12-30 02:22:12
Everyone seems to think this is true, which means it can't be. Everyone wants to sell during the price surge that is supposed to follow the halvening. However, if everyone is selling, the price can't go up.

Don't whip it with a fork or it'll get too frothy. Gently fold it into itself with a wooden spoon.

I mean, you could convert your coins to cash and then your cash to bitcoin. You'd have to pay two separate fees, though.

Did you setup port forwarding on your router?
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:25:19
Drink any time bitcoin is above or below 100k, got it.
@_date: 2019-09-04 06:48:32
It looks like the default port is 8333. You probably want to make sure your router gives your node the same network address every time it renews, forward port 8333 to that address and make sure you don't have a firewall blocking the port.
@_date: 2019-09-12 23:56:17
I see what you're saying. There is not enough information. I was unconciously making the false assumption that each person must be transacting with the same volume.

We do love money.
@_date: 2019-09-18 22:52:57
To top it all off, most peoples' 401k's include REITs, meaning that everybody is pooling some of their retirement income to buy and rent out property, driving up the prices even more. Many of these people are practically renting from themselves. Ridiculous.

I hear a lot of uninformed people saying that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. Its not. 
That chick is probably running a legit ponzi scheme, though.
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:18:31
Did they charge Bob interest?
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:30:10
But in most other cases wouldn't you potentially have some legal recourse and possibility of recovering the money?
With bitcoin, the lawyer has more plausable deniability. It wasnt me. You must have been hacked.
@_date: 2018-12-20 05:28:28
They should display it also. Isn't there malware that changes addresses on the clipboard in an attempt to make you accidentally send them bitcoin?

For the first time in almost two hours! 
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:17:05
You said that you realized that bitcoin is a good way to enhance your finances. You surmised that bitcoin would generate so much wealth for a person that they could become upper class. You asked if other people realize this. Is there something I'm missing here?
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:55:30
If the exchanges don't actually have the bitcoin that they claim, then they would have to buy it, driving up the demand.

@_date: 2018-12-21 19:59:24
An important thing to understand is that the blockchain doesn't have a list of balances that it updates. It only has a list of transactions. When a new block is added, each node checks that the transactions are valid but it doesn't have to rewrite a bunch of balances, it just adds the new transactions to the end of the list.

Seriously. Inflation offsets the interest rate on my mortgage.

I feel like a hardware wallet should be the minimum level of security for any ammount of bitcoin over like 0.2btc. I would not call this "extra mile."

I have a shitty netbook that's over a decade old that's syncing up right now to become a full node. It'll take about a week but this thing is an exercise in patience, no matter what you're doing. It would take much less time on better hardware.
