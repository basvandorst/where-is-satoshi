You’re absolutely correct

The main conclusions from that statement are that 
You can't *time the market*.  
You should be very careful about using leverage.
 
That is, even if you are right that the market should go up (or down), the weight of opinion can keep that from happening for an unpredictable length of time.  And during that time the market may go opposite to the 'right' direction.
If you use borrowed money to buy or to sell short, your loan may have to be paid back, with interest, while the market still irrationally refuses to move your way.  
Therefore, the smart investments are semi-long-term.  That is, you should buy a crypto currency you think will go up and be able to hold it until your prediction is fulfilled.  Or until you realize you were wrong.  But continuing to hold after that is a new investment.  You should sell the coins unless you have a new reason to expect it to go up.

Yea you are not the only one who’s not good at that but i will tell you something that might be helpful.  Create a trading system or a trading algorithm using technical analysis to give buy and sell signals.

Yea buy more now and sell when the price goes up

Even if you fail to consider the aforementioned crypto currencies as successful, the fact remains that those innovations was brought to limelight by young people. It goes a long way to say that you can do a lot with your youthful life. At least they have written their names in history in the crypto realm. Don’t take that away from them
