Central banks already have electronic funds.  The idea that a cabal of powerful bankers, who mind you created the 2008 financial crisis, would have the ability and secrecy to create a fictional identity "satoshi" and convince a bunch of programmers to create a cryptographicly secure currency in some long scheme to create complete control over money is a believable as GW Bush dynamiting the world trade center from a school library.

If your goal is a smooth start to trading, you should announce when that is going to start. If coinbase's goal was a smooth introduction for BCH, they probably should have said "next Tuesday at 6ct we will start trading"

This is pretty correct.  You can also find more explanation on stock broker sites like e-trade, fidelity, and such as they work the same.
You might want to explain about the Bid and Ask and the order book.  usually it isn't a huge problem when the spread is narrow or the market slow (and your trade small), but it can explain why you get a execution price different than what you were seeing. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:58:34

I believe if you leave your job they make the 401k loan due immediately or it is counted as an early withdrawl subject to taxes and penalties.  So you just want to be prepared to face that (or eat the penalties ) when the time comes.
What business are you working on? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:02:31
So as the trader you buy at the ask and sell to the bid. The ask and bid are really just the next up buy/sell limit prices from other traders (and all together it is called the order book).  The difference between them is the spread.  In a liquid market this will be very narrow (maybe less than $0.01) but if the market is slow it will get wider (maybe a couple of bucks).  So if you are about to drop a market or a close to market limit order you want to look at the bid or ask and not the last trade for a better idea of what price you'll get.(and check the size of the order)
