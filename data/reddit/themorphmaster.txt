Temporarily in the way that it will keep them there until you spend them.
On a sidenote: the "change" address was most likely created in advance. Your wallet always keeps a buffer of 100 or so of those unused addresses.

javascript resizing. I've managed to reproduce it when refreshing the page, not when opening it straight away. Was that the case? It appeared like that when you opened it the first time? That shit is bugging me for the last couple of days. That's why I need you guys! ;)

I'll open a big report on the js library bug tracker. Thanks a lot. I can only reproduce it when refreshing using FF/Chrome in Ubuntu, not on the first opening. Thank you for your report.

Yes, they can take the decision, but they also must communicate it to the parents. Don't you think I as a parent would want to know if my son was caught gambling? Bad enough offense to be punished in school but not at home, is it?
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:29:55
Why didn't the principal contacted his parents in the first place, if as he said the kid was gambling? If he was my son that principal would have some 'splainin' to do...

You would have a point on limit orders. But he describes what would happen with a market order. I don't think he can blame MtGox for his inability to use an exchange correctly.

Don't worry. The server where it's hosted originally has enough bandwidth to spend. It won't be a few GB's that will take it to the ground. Also, it would be good for the download numbers to be accounted for.
Having said that, it's public domain, so you can do what you wish.
