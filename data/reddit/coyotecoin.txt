Coin.mx 
Verify your Identity via webcam and you have to wait for them to confirm the match under 24 hours.  You can only do $2500 total transactions like this I did it with much sucess. The only sit eI have found thats that simple. Coinbase.com as well much cheaper but the card has to be a credit card no debit.

It is the same thing as if a miner found gold in a stream.  I think it is important to make points like this and establish harsh boundaries for taxation. Ultimately I think it shouldn't be taxed it is a currency a global currency, they just want to pull the wool over our eyes and hope we accept it.  If we collectively disagree they can't do a damn thing about it.

Specoin is a site that supposedly sells bitcoin and other coins. Good try though

There should be professional webdesign as well.  I do not see that listed as a service option but seems like it would go well with the site.

I don't know just hopeful.  I have seen some sites that sell using credit and debit cards never Paypal though.  I don't even know how they got that past Paypal.
