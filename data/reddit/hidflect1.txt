It's because online gambling is illegal in many places that people are trading bitcoin. If you've made money so far, get out now.

I had my card details stolen and my bank account was emptied with dozens of transactions. The bank repaid me all the money. I don't think Satoshi will do that for any Bitcoin.

EU regulations are pretty draconian. If there's something enabling activity like child porn then it's gotta go. Doesn't matter if it's intended by most users or not.

You're being emotional. The law may be an ass but it has to be drawn somewhere. If it runs right over some business model and ends up damaging legitimate operations then that's it. You need to adjust and move on. You can't start bending the law if it allows loopholes for the bad actors it was intended to prevent. 
Besides; were you naive enough to believe Bitcoin wasn't being used for kiddie porn or did you willfully ignore that? So protestations of violation of your innocent profit motives are a bit rich, don'tya think?

Bad things happen. If it's a flaw in Bitcoin that will result in it becoming outlawed due to a few bad actors then that's reality. Denying it will only lose you money.

Citibank are slowly shutting up their retail business, yes. They don't give a flying fk. They make more money being behind most of the customized credit cards you know of offered by other companies.

This is the new norm. For example: Thinking of joining a public protest? Get arrested on a technicality, get a police record. Now you can't get a decent job because they require a clean police record. Career over. Poor-ville.
