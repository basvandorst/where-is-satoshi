Well, how is this really that much different? How you will feel when it turns out it's a bubble and you're broke?

Well, I should have put it different. It's taxable, but it would be very hard to enforce the taxes.

One of the basic rules of investing, OP: Invest only money, losing which would not impede your quality of life.

Have you made money on that trade? Then it's not a good move.

It's true. I bought the coins at $47 and I knew it was high, but my intention was not to sell tomorrow or after a week or after a month. I see the value in the currency and taking all things into account I believe it will grow in the long term.

Martingale...I cringe whenever I hear that word.

Would you bet if an actual human girl will show up to a dollar meetup? Or organize a dollar/euro meetup for that matter? What the hell?
@_date: 2013-03-12 18:52:24
Yes, but I am trying to secure my future.

I think you can get that teacher fired OP.

Well, right now BTC is at $60 and seems like it's raising in price due to popularity and media attention it is getting. That's a sign of a bubble. I'd say wait til bubble bursts and then buy once it's lower again.

I think one of the biggest appeals of BTC is the fact that it's anonymous, therefore not taxable.

I am pretty sure it will go down, but that's not what really matters. What matters is the long term prospects of BTC.
