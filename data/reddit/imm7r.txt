IMO, This is the best resource.

Correct for most cases and depends on the wallet you are using. An exception to this is online wallets that can move funds internally without on chain transacion. Ex: A coinbase wallet. You can move funds between multiple coinbase wallets without a fee. Thats because they are moved off chain just within there ecosystem.

"or a part of the payment system.”
What does this imply? Zebpay tweeted out that it refers to them. So, I believe it refers to all exchanges.

I second this. 
Would also like love to see something simalar for 'price' posts. Every 5% price change or some random person saying 50k by 2020 is not worth a seprate post. 
One step at a time. ��

Thats a stupid interpretation of the article by that twitter guy which will create more FUD.
A PIL was filed by an Indian exchange that the ruling(Banks not to deal with crypto exchanges) was unconstitutional. 
The court just issued a notice to RBI for further explanation and to present there case. 
The next hearing on the same is on 24 May. 
Edit: The ruling is still in place. 
I would also like to bring to your knowledge that cases in India may take years to get resolved. 
Edit 2: Again, there was never a ban on bitcoin. Banks are probited to do business with crypto exchanges.

Nope. The exchange said that the ban is unconstitutional in their filing. The notice is for the bank(RBI) to present its part. 
Unconstitutional or not - Thats for the court to decide after hearing the bank. 
I hope it get revoked ASAP ��
To the moon ��
