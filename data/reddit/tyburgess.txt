I’ll sell you one. Send me 10 bitcoin.

Anyone who is blindly telling you to just keep buying more is delusional.  Their crystal ball is no better than yours, and they are projecting their hopes that bitcoin will turn around and head for the moon.  Did they keep buying Kodak or Blockbuster stock as well while it dropped?  Personally, I've been in this space since 2014 and I got very lucky and sold at the high.  And every day I feel bad for the poor sucker who bought my bitcoin for $19600, but that's the way the game is played.  The news that tether may have been manipulating the price last year is very worrying to me.  This indicates that the market didn't drive the price up, but that a single centralized exchange did.  I can't help but wonder what Satoshi would think of that, seeing his invention manipulated by people strictly out of greed. And if it was really market manipulation that drove the price to almost $20K, then there is absolutely no guarantee that it will go that high again.  Right now the market dictates that the price is around $6000.  Do your own research to discover whether you think it will go up or go down.  Just don't listen to people out to promote their own agendas.

I am in BC and electricity here runs about 13 cents per kilowatt hour.  I have been running five Antminer S9's since May this year and  have paid them off completely. (Roughly $2000 CAD each after shipping and tax)  You should count on making about $15-$20 US a day, minus roughly $4.50 for power.  I also invested in an $8000 air conditioning system for my garage to keep the machines cool, and am working towards having that paid off before Christmas.  After that, its all gravy.  Point your miners towards Slushpool or Nicehash, and you'll be fine.  My neighbor just ordered two for his garage as well.  Good luck!

I buy from Bitmain a lot and you can count on an S9 costing you around $2000 landed.  You'll get charged GST on the purchase price, about $250.  The problem you'll have is with the PSU from Bitmain.  It only runs on 220v power so you will need to have an electrician wire you up.  You can do the entire transfer from your Quadriga wallet, its easy.  You know that you will have to wait a couple of months for the product right?  If  you're in Vancouver, I have a few units coming in next week and maybe I can help you out.

Sorry, that's $2000 US dollars, not CAD

Current laws require you to report profits once you sell. As long as you’re “hodling” you’re all good.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:31:45
I agree. Excellent post
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:00:37
I DO agree,  however that the investment might have been better served just buying bitcoin with the money, but I haven't had any issues with maintenance of the miners, and I hope to have them running until they either break down or it becomes unprofitable, which has so far not happened.  Any reduction in the amount of bitcoin mined has so far been offset by the price increases.  If bitcoin was to crash, things could certainly change.  Also, if I decided to get out of mining tomorrow, there is enough demand for the S9 that I could probably recoup my initial investment as well.

I use Quadriga all the time.  No problems.
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:55:42
I use a credit union in Vancouver and they are very supportive of the bitcoin community.  I even get called into the manager's office on a regular basis to give him updates on the state of the market.  And while Quadriga is fine, their delays in getting money in and out forced me to start to look around.  I now use Gemini, and they are fantastic.  Wire transfers are done in hours, not days.

I use QuadrigaCX all the time and they have been great.  Located in Vancouver.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:02:20
Dude, have a cup of coffee.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:13:11
QuadrigaCX,  I've used it and it has been fine. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:30:14
I'm in North Van, and would be interested, PM me if you like.

His Bitcoin.com website was promoting a scam site called tothemoon.com as well.  I told them about it but they refused to take down the scammer's ads.  I wouldn't trust that guy ever.

Waves coffee houses (in Vancouver at least)

Oh man, that is TOO funny! 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:22:15
My single S9 makes about $20.00 a day. My electricity costs are about $4.00. You do the math.

There seem to be two distinct camps arguing about how best to speed up the time it is taking to verify transactions. I am trying my best to understand the benefits and drawbacks of both arguments,  but it is a very complicated issue. In a nutshell, if consensus cannot be reached by the two sides, there is the possibility of a hard fork, meaning that the block chain would split into two, and there would effectively be TWO bitcoins. While this might sound great to you and me (Yay! Now I have twice as many!) the problem is that until the dust settles and one comes out as the dominant coin, through acceptance by the bitcoin community or the miners mining bitcoin, there is a chance that one of the new block chains could become invalid. 
Let's say for sake of argument that the block chain splits and we now have Bitcoin A and Bitcoin B. You are holding 10 bitcoins in your Breadwallet when this happens. Now you have 10 Bitcoin A and 10 Bitcoin B. You decide to buy something and spend your Bitcoin A. Now time passes and the community starts to lean more toward Bitcoin B. More people start to mine it, more users are trading it and it ends up as the dominant coin. This would effectively wipe out the Bitcoin A block chain, and all of the transactions that had occurred on it. So the transaction you created is now invalid and the person you sent those Bitcoin A to never receives them. Not too bad for you, since you probably received whatever you purchased, but very bad for the seller. So this fear could paralyze the Bitcoin economy, and create a lot of problems.  The best bet is to wait and see what happens when either of the fixes are implemented in the next couple of months. If your bitcoins remain in your wallet until the dust settles you will be fine. 
Hopefully the big players can resolve this before it gets to that. Bitcoin is a constantly changing, evolving creature. It has survived and thrived up to this point, I am confident that this will also get resolved and things will move forward. Don't let the skeptics create panic where there shouldn't be any.

Coinbase will allow you to link a credit card to their service and purchase $500 CAD per week.  They "currently" do not offer any way for Canadians to sell their Bitcoins.  I have spoken to their customer service reps and they tell me that this is a service that they hope to offer in the future.  That's about as ambiguous a statement they can make.  They offer no timeline which leads me to believe that it isn't a priority for them.  You can set up an account with Quadrigacx but their customer service needs work.  There are also a LOT of people online who will pay cash for your bitcoin at present, but you have to be careful not to get taken. Craigslist, eBay and Kijiji all have people looking to buy.  If they pay you with PayPal you should be fine, but always get paid before you send anyone your hard earned coins.
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:51:42
Yeah, they just have a small screen at the cash out and you just scan the QR code that pops up. Easy! I go to the North Van one all the time. They also have a Bitcoin ATM in there, but it's a bit more expensive to use.

First off, get yourself a wallet. I use Breadwallet for the iPhone. It is very secure and should be set up with "two factor verification" through Google Authenticator (another app). Once that is set up you will have an address to put your bitcoins. All exchanges require you to verify your identity, usually with scans of your drivers license or passport, as well as bank account information. This is a necessary step for them to protect against money laundering and tax evasion (especially in the US). Once you get your account verified, you will be able to purchase small amounts of Bitcoin with either your bank account, or a credit card. As I mentioned, Coinbase limits credit card purchases to $500 for me, and I've been verified for over a year now (but I'm Canadian, so this could be why). Another exchange called Poloniex has a limit of $25000, so you see they can differ greatly.
My advice would be to set up an account with an exchange and start to make small weekly purchases. This will cost average your purchases over the long run. Some people think you might be too late to the game, but they have no more idea than you or I, so anytime is better than no time. . 
And do not hold your purchases in the exchange you choose. Look up Mt. Gox for a painful lesson on letting someone else hold your Bitcoin. Regularly transfer your purchases to your Breadwallet account. Now your phone becomes your bank. Make sure to back up the recovery phrase Breadwallet gives you. That way if you ever lose your phone, you don't lose your Bitcoin with it. 
And lastly, head to a coffee shop that accepts bitcoins (I go to Waves) and buy something using your Breadwallet. Congratulations, you're part of the Bitcoin economy!

I'll buy 10 if the price is right!
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:33:52
I have it even worse off than you. I'm Canadian and while I have no problem BUYING on Coinbase, there is no option for me to SELL. I'm starting to worry that when the time finally comes and I want to sell, I won't be able to without a LOT of hassle
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:16:06
My concern is that all of you are so concerned.
