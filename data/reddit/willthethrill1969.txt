This happens when the value of a whole bitcoin is much higher that the current value - think $1M or more. Penny stocks = volatile, and bitcoin is still a penny stock.

For fun, I went lightning network as a lifestyle a day after the android app for lightning labs went live. Paycheck -&gt; fiat bank -&gt; Cash App -&gt; hardware wallet -&gt; Lightning wallet -&gt; [bitrefill.com]( to live. I normally pay my statement balance and use/abuse my credit cards for points. [Bitrefill.com]( can cover basically 70% of spending requirements for my family (Amazon, Walmart, Starbucks, restaurants, etc.) that is normally moved via Amex/Visa/Mastercard. This may work out a bit better than cash back points (and has so far with these BTC gains).

I mainly use a ledger nano wallet for storing. A small part of my stack is on my Samourai wallet on my phone "in case shit" because my ledger is in a hole in the groud with a bomb shelter above it. Another $200-$800 worth is on my lightning labs wallet so I can buy stuff at walmart and amazon via bitrefill. Been using coinbase and cash app to top up the spending wallet on lightning. I used to be the credit card points guy, but now I'm just trying to switch to recharging my lightning on the DCA plan.

People bought at $2 and $200 and $1800 and $5000 and $15000 and $4000 and $8000 and $12000 and $17000. Hold on and don't buy more than you can afford to lose. Also, it's ok to spend some, especially if you buy back to replace the spend.

I use dice to make my randomness or "entropy". It takes several rolls of a 24 sided dice to come up with a word. We agree that it is hard to trust someone else generating a random number from a snippet of computer code. Words are from a dictionary, and each is chosen from a list of 2048 words.. Within 5 or 6 words into a sequence, you pretty quickly get beyond the chance of someone guessing the words in the right order randomly. By the time you get to 24 words, it's basically impossible.
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:48:53
The private key is the source of the public key. You can't determine the private key using the public key. So long as you are in singular control of the private key, nobody else can control the transfer of your bitcoin or otherwise show ownership.

I am having a problem using my 24 word seed to recover my lightning wallet. My best guess is that I mixed up the order of a couple of the words. When I plug the phrase into my lightning wallet to recover it, I get a message that it's invalid. I've tried putting the phrase into an aezeed cipher decoder and it is indicating that I have an invalid checksum. Anyone know of some python code somewhere that will shuffle the 24 words I do have until I get a valid checksum?
@_date: 2019-08-08 03:12:06
Pretty much, there is absolutely no way to make sure that the host generating the signature is legit when using a PC that is connected to the internet - it could show you the address you are expecting, and still steal your money. Also, people telling you to use Linux are delusional. Your only hope is to have an isolated host generate the signed message. This is the reason "hardware" wallets exist and the reason you must use air gap setups when any significant sum of money is at risk.

I've been buying Uber giftcards to cover the ride once the driver shows up. I use [bitrefill.com]( and I want to do my part seeing what sucks about lightning. So far, I've found no evidence that it sucks. I'm also shopping Walmart, Whole Foods, and Amazon - buying a gift card while in checkout line (or screen).

Use a hardware wallet. If you don't have singular control of the keys, then it's not really your money.

The other 9 addresses are other customers on Bittrex. They (bittrex) are batching transactions which is good for the memory pool and means less network load. Every time there is another block (roughly every 10 minutes) your transaction is more deeply secured (confirmed) on the blockchain. After a couple blocks, it would take absolutely immense levels of computing power to "undo" your transaction. For small transactions (think under $100,000), just 1 or 2 confirmation is pretty much rock solid, for bitcoin blockchain would make it no where near worth it for someone to rent enough computing power to reverse your transaction - this is why you should care about how secure Bitcoin is compared to shit coin blockchains with relatively low hashpower behind them. For $500 million, I would be sweating until I saw a few more confirmations in any case :)
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:55:36
You don't need internet connectivity to have bitcoin moved to an address that you control and that address doesn't need to be known by the network ahead of it's first use. No communication is required beyond that signed message that is broadcast to the network by the sender when they send you the bitcoin,
@_date: 2019-08-09 01:04:57
I don't agree. Spend them and keep on with the DCA. I treat mine like a credit card that I pay off every month - and I front load that as much as possible. Bitrefill is awesomeness with lightning. I figure I'm helping Bitcoin by actually using it on a daily basis.

Bitcoins are mined. The only difference between someone mining back at the beginning compared to now is that your PC's CPU is no longer a strong enough competitor in the pool of miners to have any chance to mine a block. People doing bitcoin mining used to get 50 BTC a couple times a day if they were really early, using your run of the mill PC to do the mining, to support the network. At some point, GPUs took over, then later someone decided to make some specialized compute hardware just for the game at hand. That is where we are today \* many iterations of specialized silicon wafers. Back when bitcoins were worth less than the lint being gathered by the power supply fan on the computer mining them, people were pretty careless with their private keys, and many didn't back up what they should have, or life happened, and they formatted that PC with the keys, and in the case of "Satoshi" the public doesn't really know what happened. Nobody was "an early investor" in the sense of paying money to build up the a capital fund for "Bitcoin Inc." to go out there and be money.

CashApp gives you an address you can send and receive from. My weekly buy stays on my CashApp account for a little bit during the day. When I get home from work, I send it to my hardware wallet if I'm going to save it (stacking satoshis!), or to a lightning wallet on my phone if I'm planning to spend it. Robinhood doesn't give you the option of actually controlling the bitcoin you own, so beware.

Kraken, Coinbase, and Gemini are all USA based. KYC is a PITA. Might have better luck with a larger credit union (mine loves sending my money to coinbase). I also use Chase without a problem. Another good option (although KYC isn't working for me) is Cash App.

If it went to $5k the day after you bought at $11k, would you put in another $5k a month later to double your position without breaking a sweat? Would you have enough money sitting around to make that a no brainer? Those are the 2 questions you need to ask yourself. DCA is the way and the light.

How are people coming here asking about investing? When you purchase bitcoin with the singular intention of selling for a higher price in a stupidly short timeframe, you are a speculator.. To OP, get a really nice android tablet using half the cash, then get some bitcoin. Treat the bitcoin as a project to teach you how to transact using a cryptocurrency. Additional and relevant educational goals are met using ( or losing) the same amount of money.

If you are in USA, then Coinbase works. so does Gemini, Cash App, and a few others. Think of those as USD onramps/offramps for you to enter and exit the bitcoin universe. You can also skip a lot of the KYC (know your customer) associated bullshit and pay a premium (7%-20%) at a local bitcoin ATM.
To get some real world experience transacting with bitcoin on your resume without much risky exposure, do the whole long process.
1) deposit cash into a bank account
2) move that cash to Coinbase via an ACH bank transfer (wait 5-10 business days)
3) move funds for free from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro
4) place an order on coinbase pro for a few cents or dollars below the market price of bitcoin
5) move those funds into a bitcoin lightning wallet on your android phone
6) open a channel on lightning
7) buy a amazon/whole foods/walmart giftcard using bitcoin from [bitrefill.com]( or [purse.io](
8) use giftcard to buy groceries
9) trade bag of groceries for illegal drugs on the street
10) get arrested because it was a sting since step 2. 
11) get high with some random shit your cell mate has in his bung hole
Shorter version (that actually gets you high)
1) go to bitcoin atm
2) put in money
3) send it to someone via silkroad3
4) receive illegal drugs from the internet
5) get high in your parents house

Alt coins are traded/priced primarily in terms of bitcoin and on a daily basis, generally are traded on a smaller scale than bitcoin. This is why you see the price of alt coins move with bitcoin. Try viewing the prices of alt coins in terms of bitcoin instead of your local currency - this is where you will see a more natural looking price graph when comparing alt coins to one another.
As for the large jumps in price that happen in minutes, these are typically due to a number of traders (human or bots) using leverage (borrowed money) to place bets on the short term smaller changes in price. When a large number of traders are wrong enough, their positions are liquidated by the exchanges (to protect the lenders of that borrowed money)  when the individual traders credit limits are hit. These traders are often using market analysis techniques to predict market moves that are well known, and therefore many of them are placing these bets/limits at around the same price points. When something small happens to the price that wasn't predicted by those techniques, they all lose their bets at about the same time. When this happens, it can cause a very big swing in supply or demand across the market, which instantly affect price. If you google "short squeeze", you will find a lot a material on the subject of leveraged trading and it's impacts on prices.
At first glance, a lot of people might think this whole leveraged trading thing is bad, or worse "manipulation", but once you dig into it, you might realize that it's a very necessary tool for the market itself to do "price discovery" (also google that).
