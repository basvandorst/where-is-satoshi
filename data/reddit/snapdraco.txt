Legit. That's pretty much a more sane version of the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:33:45
that statement made no sense.  I'm not even talking BTC, if you had 3 cars an hour and 30000 lanes, there wouldn't be traffic.
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:44:25
...pray? Hit him with your own wrench?
@_date: 2015-06-30 07:37:07
At that point, would it matter in what form said money was in?
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:07:30
Are you serious? Bitcoin is distributed by design, so any transactions not relayed an ever happen.
If you are asking why it doesn't have a built in 3G modem, beats me...
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:26:23
Um.. That's pretty crazy. The chance that an atm will be within reach of a router is pretty low for 99% of deployments. Unless you own the store you are deployed in
@_date: 2014-12-12 09:09:27
Damn, love that answer
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:22:27
OK. For starters, when you have Bitcoin, you don't actually possess the coins. They are written in a public ledger as belonging to you, and you posses a code number that gives you the right to transfer them to another (spend)
That code number can be backed up on paper if you like.
As for trezor, that's more interesting. Trezors approach is "what if the computer isn't secure?"
So the trezor device holds onto that secret number for you, and only gives the computer the approvals for transfer (so you can buy/sell) but the computer never knows the secret, so even if you have a virus trying to steal your Bitcoin it won't work

This! 
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:13:54
Thanks!  I know the problems are out there,  but if every business that solves one adds to the project as a whole,  all issues will be resolved before long 
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:20:36
If it's cancelled,  can you transfer it out as btc? 
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:06:22
More than just being the kind of post we need,  code sharing is what we need in order to make these issues "solved problens" 
It sounds like you did some incredible work and research.  Could you share your code for others to use and improve? 
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:44:20
There are plenty of other coin options. BTC as a concept has won, either way
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:03:26
Just send BTC, whats the problem?
If she needs it in ILS, she should look up a local bitcoin buyer or ATM.
You could also use Paypal, but thats not for @_date: 2017-03-20 22:43:50
It worked for me.
It could be my account is special though. PayPal has weird exceptions.
Bitcoin is great for this stuff, but you both need to read just a tiny bit in order to make sure you are doing it right and not being taken advantage of.
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:02:05
Fair enough. But then that's not security for security, it's for piracy
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:24:01
Actually not possible (unless you cover the code with film and its "not worth anything" if the foil is scratched off)
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:31:35
Honestly, if neither of you understand Bitcoin at all, you might want to try PayPal first.
Much less learning involved.
If you do want to, read up using the sidebar articles
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:57:43
it's not that they don't want money, they need to build a new billing system that doesn't use paypal.
Possibly the new one WILL support bitcoin, who knows?
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:54:05
Honestly, the best way to go about this is to use Google to research Bitcoin laws in the regions you are interested in. 
If this subject is really important to you, you can't afford to have only prechewed   opinions from other redditors.
Any simple summary will leave you missing information which is needed if you plan on legally  converting Bitcoin to fiat in your country
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:55:43
Problem is, without Bitcoin the app is useless to almost everyone who used it.
If I wanted cash transfer that's centralized and crap, I'd use PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:41:54
Isn't that the attack vector we worry about?
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:55:20
.... This isn't a terrible idea at all.
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:45:32
Yes they do
@_date: 2016-11-16 07:09:29
Definitely, considering a device is needed to even have a BTC wallet.
In theory though, that's where altcoins shine. In the very low value market
@_date: 2017-04-18 07:00:23
Or the server. Or anything. Trust no one
@_date: 2016-09-19 15:26:28
dude, leave something for the rest of us :-) you said it all.
@_date: 2016-09-24 21:11:14
Scaring people off using btc. I left for a while since it seemed like the community would rather tear each other apart thank develop it
@_date: 2016-09-19 15:32:26
he's saying that to his knowledge, there isn't an explicit "earrings that are a golden color cannot be misrepresented as a more expensive metal than they are"
while i think his example is lacking, the gist of it is correct - the law doesn't have to explicitly list every thing you can do fraudulently to make it fraud. There are catchalls, but as always, I'm not a lawyer.
@_date: 2016-09-06 06:43:59
See, the problems with "abuse", at the end of the day, are the reasons humble bundles are successful.
Games are overpriced for the majority of us. We can't afford to buy every $20+ game that catches our interest.
If people would rather buy a sketchy copy of your game on eBay than on steam, they either aren't a customer to begin with, or you are overpriced.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:09:53
why does everyone seem to be making these apps lately?
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:28:18
Very cool :) I wish you luck!
@_date: 2016-09-06 09:40:34
It already is for me. There's enough cheap bundles and other things out there now that I never pay more than $5 for a game.
And with Netflix, who needs to pay $100/season anymore? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:45:03
How does that protect you?
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:28:42
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:28:32
I like you
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:15:31
aw, you shouldn't have... literally.
@_date: 2016-10-20 14:41:19
Old PCs running XP and ATOM systems. That's it
@_date: 2017-05-11 12:16:02
Marry me
@_date: 2016-05-03 09:09:18
@_date: 2015-02-26 08:33:25
Take them to small claims court.  PayPal can (and likely will ) still fuck you over. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:28:43
Exactly this. They don't have a very stable government, so printing their own money would be a huge deal.
@_date: 2016-07-21 08:49:59
Pretty much.
@_date: 2017-06-25 11:07:19
So much this.
@_date: 2016-05-03 09:08:39
The hack here was a social/human one - and even smart people can be fooled.
I'm sure it came with a convincing story.
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:57:42
You are missing the point. He said nothing about a block size at all.
Just that any decisions made about Bitcoin should not compromise security, and should enable other layers to exist.
