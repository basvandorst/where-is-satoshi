I read this a lot on here but it really doesn't make sense to me. Just because Bitcoin is a completely new thing, doesn't mean the laws of wild speculation act any differently.

Gee, I can't wait to be an infinityaire!

Because crypto market is unregulated.

what about all the new money at the moment coming in off the hype, what will they do as soon as they see a significant drop? I don't think a lot of the new investors give a shit about bitcoin or hodling, they just want to cash and cash out. If they see there investment go backwards for a day or more they might cut and run. The price taking a 25% drop is good for us hodlers who want to buy cheap, but the more people jumping on with a week hand the bigger the drop will be and the more volatile bitcoin will become. new actual investors will be scared away and will be replaced with day trading gamblers.      
       
edit: I think the best thing would be for it to have a sizable re-correct now followed by slower predictable growth.

Is there any way to estimate the likelyhood of that happening?

I agree that there are a lot of good discussions on this sub but finding them is a bit like picking through trash for morsals of food. The constant gloating and memes bragging about the current ATH really make this place seem like a circlejerk subreddit.

Pretty sure they can go even higher.

I really think questions like this deserve more upvotes than they usually get compared to pictures of Vegeta.     
    
Provoking discussion is a good thing and strengthens Bitcoin. I'm also interested in the realistic hurdles that Bitcoin needs to clear. I believe in Bitcoin but it doesn't mean it will be a smooth ride to the Moon and beyond.

It's still important to vote against those who are actually elected officials. Unlike her master's we have direct control over her employment. If everyone voted against shills like her the owners' powers would at least be limited.

It's the voters job to be informed and inform others. If there's no one to vote for that isn't owned by wall street and other lobbyists then it's our job to make enough noise and demand someone who actually speaks for us. Voters being more engaged is the key to creating a space for new uncorrupt politicians to come forward. Excorcising your power and voting out one of the worst culprits won't solve the problem but it's a step in the right direction. Saying 'voting won't make difference until there is new blood' and then just waiting isn't going to do anything.
