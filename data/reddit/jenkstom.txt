Use [deterministic wallets]( Memorize the seed and optionally place a written / engraved copy of it somewhere very secure. 
Stop worrying about backups and just generate or regenerate keys as you need them on a secure device.

A blockchain is just a transaction consensus protocol. That has all sorts of uses for managing conflict in distributed systems. Banks do lots of that, so the technology could apply. 
Blockchains as we know them are a bit heavy handed, though. They are intended to be defensible against attack. For internal use, other consensus protocols make more sense. 
Blockchains make more sense when parties with differening interests need a consensus, such as between multpile entities. I see a form of blockchain becoming the standard for this eventually.

*sigh* He's mixing his mathematical metaphors (say that three times quickly). He's using inflationary ROI mathematical formulas for a deflationary currency. Of *course* it doesn't work out right, it's apples and oranges.
He exaggerates the numbers to make it look like you are paying hugely more at the end of the loan than you would at the beginning. In reality, if you chose to set it up this way, you might pay a bit more, depending on how much the currency appreciates. That would be part of negotiating the loan. Have you looked at how a 30 year amortization schedule works out? Even at "low" interest rates your overall cost is several times what you originally were asked to pay.
I would imagine some economics or finance professor has already worked all of this math out.

There are two scenarios: 1) they gain 51% of global hash speed and take over the bitcoin network. 2) they don't.
Obviously 1 is a problem, but that doesn't seem to be what we are talking about.
In the scenario of 2, they only way they can make coins is to hash the same thing as everybody else - "honestly". If they had enough power to make a lot of bitcoins and not pay for electricity, then it would still make the currency stronger (by increasing the global hash rate). The only thing that would happen is that the botnet controllers would get some "free" bitcoins. This is no threat to the overall economy, just simple theft of electricity.
And as others have pointed out, once ASICs are common, no normal botnet will be able to take over the magic 51%.

The two things are not related to each other, so yes. The money is sent to your address, that doesn't happen on your client. Your client then analyzes the blockchain to see how much money is in each of your addresses and shows you that information.

The security of bitcoin depends on a lot of people doing math. As a reward, people who do math are randomly given free money. The more math you do, the more likely you get free money.

I've been to Colombia, it's a very interesting place with very friendly people. Spent some time in Barrio Nelson Mandela in Cartagena for a medical clinic (I was and still am a Paramedic student). We brought thousands of dollars of medicine to a clinic, we had a full-time military patrol around where we had the clinic setup. 
It is still the only time I've been outside the US, and it was a great (and enlightening) experience. I was very surprised about a lot of things, including the Colombian airline that is one of the oldest in existence. I wish I could fly Avianca all the time, it makes airlines in the US look pathetic. Also, the old city there in Cartagena is an amazing place, along with the big fort behind it.
Cartagena is a lovely place, I'd love to take a vacation there sometime. It's a bit warm, though. :-)

Trying to find a metaphor / allegory is really difficult. No idea if this is useful or not, but it sort of gets the basic idea across.
Bitcoin is a giant internet whiteboard that computers are constantly checking for accuracy. If you own a square you can send money from it if you have it. If someone tries to send money without having it, the watchers erase the transactions. Every ten minutes one of the computers that checks the hardest gets free money put into one of the squares.

Actually the service has been great. No issues, do downtime, no connectivity problems. Straightforward and easy setup. 
I'll do an honest review, do with it what you like:
I have the OpenVZ 1536, which is working with zero issues for postgresql + postgis + a GIS heavy website. I'm running Debian 7.0 64 bit and it is plenty of juice for what I am doing. 
I'm even doing some memory- and CPU-heavy cron-based geospatial analysis (longley-rice irregular terrain model via splat! and the SRTM3 data). There is plenty of storage, which is necessary for GIS crap. The 100GB was a big selling point.
I am planning to migrate several more websites over, it looks like it should handle those fine also. The payment with bitcoins was painless.
I actually spent a week or so looking for a service that worked for me. One of the biggest issues was RAM. Everybody wants to give me 256MB or 512MB, which postgresql works well with, but BIND9 just chokes on. I had paid for a three-month VPS with ovh.ie, which I really like. Granted, it was a slightly lower price point, but processes just kept running out of memory and being killed by the kernel. So I don't even use it anymore.
ServerBros was on my top-three list for BTC-accepting providers (bitvps.com and chunkhost.com were the other two). And if you look it's pretty obvious why I chose ServerBros. If OVH took bitcoins they probably would have kept my business and I would have upgraded. But they don't.
The SolusVM management panel thingy is OK. Not anything as fancy as OVH has, but it does what I need. Which is mostly rebooting. I haven't shot myself in the foot yet (like uninstalling some essential part of the OS and rebooting) with ServerBros. OVH does a great job of handling that type of thing, I have no idea how ServerBros handles that. Hopefully well, because I'm sure it'll happen sometime.
The only issue so far is that I don't seem to be able to put that nifty discount code into the payment system. :-)

Actually the problem with a deflationary currency is supposed to be that some people will stop investing and just hold on to their currency. This is a big problem in fractional reserve banking, because the size of the currency is heavily dependent on loans. A currency that isn't loaned "as much" can't be "as big". But this just means that the value of each unit goes up, and each bitcoin is divisible into a billion pieces. (Please keep in mind that it's value *change* that concerns us with inflation vs. deflation, not value as value.)
Is it weird and new and scary? Yes. Is it really a problem? No, just that some time-honored financial concepts do not apply to bitcoin the same way they apply to other currencies.
Gold has become an investment thing (although people "invest" in currencies, quite a bit of US currency is held outside the US), I agree. The only reason it isn't used as a currency any more is because it is tedious... you have to measure it, verify it's purity, etc. This means that each transaction is laborious, and so it is rarely used for transactional exchange.
But bitcoin IS very easy to trade and verify. It's not labor intensive at all, the heavy lifting is done by computers. It has many of the best qualities of both gold and currency.
Definitions of "currency" vary, but anything that is valuable (i.e., we can trust that there won't suddenly be a "lot more" of it, like gold) and easy traded can be a currency. Bitcoin takes this to a whole new level. Both of these components of "money" or "currency" are being done in an entirely new way. 
What was done with communication and then knowledge when the internet exploded is now being done with value. It can go places it has never gone before, in completely new ways. This is what all the fuss is about.
So the "Information Superhighway" is turning into a "Value Superhighway". Imagine what facebook looks like with value integrated? "Like" sends the poster actual money, instantaneously. Social interaction becomes integrated with value interaction, and value becomes even more social than it ever was (this is happening on reddit already with the bitcoin tip-bot). And so social interaction becomes the coin of the realm. (Read Cory Doctorow's "Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom" for a take on this, it's free.)
As I said. It's a Big Deal. It's the next iteration of the internet. I'd say it's a strong "Buy". :-)

I couldn't finish it, too many silly things here. 
The point that people without the internet can't use a digital currency is absurd, plenty of third world countries have ATMs everywhere. That's a fiat-backed digital currency. A bitcoin wallet is virtual, we depend on the capacity of miners for it to exist, not equipment we own ourselves. Paper wallets work just fine. You only need electronics to send or receive money, technology for that is becoming ubiquitous worldwide.
The fact that bitcoin doesn't fit any definition Mises used seems to be an argument that bitcoin will fail. What? Maybe it's a failure of his conceptual framework?
I had to give up. It sounded good, but there wasn't much substance. I seemed like a rationalization to me.

The concept of a risk-free rate is based on complete faith that a particular investment will have a particular return. Really what it means is that you will get your investment back or things will be so screwed up that it won't matter anyway.
Since bitcoin is a deflationary currency, the risk free rate is to hold (0%). The closest thing besides that would be something like satoshi dice that is "provably fair". But there's not a trillion dollar government backing satoshi dice either, so your mileage may vary.
Moving the risk free rate to 0% is one of the biggest criticisms of bitcoin. It really is deflationary, which in normal circumstances leads to a downward spiral and a currency collapse. 
But in this case many of the factors that contribute to that positive feedback loop (positive = out of control, negative = homeostasis) are missing: a government to create more currency because there is "not enough", banks that hold fractional reserves - this can still happen, but I don't believe it affects "faith" in the currency itself.
So it's a brave new world, and many financial concepts will have to be rethought and reworked. Especially if things like financial options can be built into the protocol itself and there is no way to "cheat".
But I think the concept of a risk-free rate does not apply to bitcoin (or it should just be considered as zero). 
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:34:18
With an inflationary currency, the risk free rate is some standard measure, like the return on 10 year bonds. To convert that back to buying power, you adjust for inflation. This rate is what you use to decide whether to keep your money or invest it.
With a deflationary currency, the risk free rate is the increase over time of the value of the currency. This doesn't usually happen with currency because of the way it works, but it works with commodities like gold that have a diminishing renewability (as opposed to bacon, which is renewable). So it isn't anything new under the sun, it's just that some people are having difficulty with the semantics.
In today's world, if investors are worried about long-term risk (a bear market), they are more interested in lower-risk, lower-return investments like bonds (or gold or silver). When the markets are bullish,  they shift some investments back to higher-risk investments because the risk to reward ratio decreases (less risk for more reward).
This really doesn't change the behavior of investors and savers. Right now, bitcoin is dramatically deflationary, so owners want to hang on to their bitcoins since they can't find anything better. But eventually it will stop growing at such a high rate and they will treat it like a commodity (which it is) rather than a currency (which it sort of is).
So really if you think of bitcoins as gold, and study how economies worked with physical gold coins or gold-backed paper money, then that is more like how bitcoin works (or will work in the future). This is why today's bitcoin economy is compared to a gold rush. People are investing heavily in finding new bitcoins since it can be very profitable.

A Mac IS a PC. The IBM "PC" went out of date in the mid 80's. Inside the difference is negligible. The operating system makes the difference. So it's "Mac" vs "Windows" maybe, but PC is silly. 
By the way, "PC" is a term only Mac people use. Everybody else calls them computers.
Sorry.
