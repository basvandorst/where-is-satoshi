yeah, here's suggestion from Tyler Winklevoss: there is an easy way to short bitcoin. You can short  the  Bitcoin (USD) Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is!

The concept of buffett's value investment is really not fully adapted to the current market. Warren buffett represents the American capitalist market, and now it is the era of the Internet and intelligence. Obviously, this era belongs to people who understand technology and future trends；while those early investors might soon lose the dominant power of this society.

@_date: 2018-05-02 03:18:35
Bitcoin will definitely take a very important role worldwide in the next few years, and don't underestimate the old generation, who are trying to learn new things! But the problem is: when Bitcoin becoming stronger---not only in transactions, but also in other areas, government intervention will come.
@_date: 2018-05-03 11:39:01
sounds like Arabian Nights
@_date: 2018-05-04 02:10:23

@_date: 2018-05-08 03:38:08
only thing I can do for Bitcoin is to buy more :O
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:46:53
It's really from a new perspecive that you have free electricity, but most people dont have such oppotunities like you do. Electricity cost is very important to mining.

@_date: 2018-06-06 11:08:06

@_date: 2018-06-07 07:46:14
 I think it depends,  I trust Bitcoin the most, but I also buy alt coins
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:03:56
oh here again
@_date: 2018-04-26 03:31:23

@_date: 2018-04-25 07:20:20
Good progress! If I am merchant, I'd like to accept BTC at a low price, then wait for the raise :O
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:00:50
hmm, look at the slight fluctuation during these 2 days...
@_date: 2018-04-23 06:44:53
I believe that one day we can use bitcoin for everything as we are using credit card....as well as maybe 100 years ago people didn't imagine such kind of payment!
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:18:03
never worried....
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:39:46
Oh this again...everyday...
@_date: 2018-04-27 02:25:10
1)	According to current normal calculation, in 2140 all the bitcoins get mined and we are all dead; but who knows what will happen during such a long time? Science and technology is growing day by day, maybe someone pops up and creates some fantastic calculation to change all this? Or maybe the whales and top investors try to make a big change to the market. I meant everything could happen, we might don’t need to wait that long? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 07:11:45
nice try
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:35:59
Crazy....show sympathy to Polish....
@_date: 2018-04-23 05:56:10
I use a China brand miner, electricity cost is approximately 0.1 USD/kw·h.
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:23:47
definitely some apparatus want to promote it and draw attention :O now students on campus talking about BTC, wow, that's what they want?
@_date: 2018-04-23 07:15:01
anyone share some thoughts on BTC mining with miner??
@_date: 2018-04-30 08:04:05
Bitcoin mining usually happen in suburb area, which make full use of almost free local excess power of energy. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 02:35:34
