Have him check out this podcast. Ed and Ethan 86 bountiful baskets of bitcoin banter blather and buster on YouTube. Peter schiff calls it a Ponzi scheme and they clown on him. Excellent episode for anyone.

I emailed mark Cuban when the kings announced that they would accept bitcoin and asked about the mavericks. He politely responded immediately saying that bitcoin would be hacked and he was not interested. I was surporised.

Bloomburg isn't real news. None of the state controlled media is. Search outside sources.

Haha. Risk of being honest. Yeah they should fix their formulas.

If you are in the Dallas area check out the Bitcoin Meetup this Saturday at 5pm at the Loon.  Plenty of exciting bitcoiners will be there for networking and discussions.  All levels of experience welcome!

We have been brainwashed to think inflation is necessary. It is only necessary for the central authority's maximum power. 
Most of the deflation fear talk is only relevant for debt-based currency. You can't have deflationary collapse in asset back currencies.

Nice blog. Do you have any opinion on ethereum?  People I trust are on both ends of the spectrum. Socialist disaster, the messaiah.

I don't like the central bank of Cyprus.

Have a coffee  to celebrate @_date: 2014-02-06 23:54:38
Also, I've found it more effective to reach out to people who are still learning about btc rather than made up
Their mind. It's critical the way people first learn about. Local meet ups are huge I think because it helps new people not feel like outcasts when they are starting.

Yeah people often say bitcoin needs regulation. In fact, it is very regulated. Just not by bureaucrats, corruption and guns. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:13:55
That's awesome. Here's a coffee if you make it there @_date: 2014-11-06 05:40:44
Cheers, have a coffee on me. @_date: 2014-01-13 23:22:04

Gold and bitcoin are completely separate. Depends on what you want to do.

Intrinsic value is a lie. Something doesn't have value unless a human says it does.

It still makes sense even if you don't go 100% btc. You can do sled directed precious metals and pretty much anything else. They just make it slightly difficult so the average sheep (like me) will just fund the bankers' HFT experiments.

The advantage of Bitcoin over fiat is that the rich actually have to manage their money responsibly to keep it. That can't just have Janet print them a few new units.

I don't think he did anything stupid. He just said that in self-defense in hopes of escaping from his cage more quickly.

I bought some at 40. Took me 4 days to figure out how to money gram to zip zap or something. Unfortunately I only bought 1.

Sounds fun. We are having one in Dallas but that won't help you this time.
@_date: 2016-07-11 23:37:56
That's great. I hate that a portion of my salary goes to buy stalks from the bankers.
@_date: 2016-07-15 01:15:20
Interesting. I wish them all the best but I hate the idea of a bitcoin ETF. It's a bankster mechanism to manipulate real money.

Download the LibertyX app and buy some at a local spot.

Thanks. Got the Dallas Deep Ellum ones. They were a big hit!
