tl;dr - Eris has changed a lot in the last 18 months. 
We used to be about private chains. Now we're about distributed systems tooling. Private chains are just part of a growing toolbox, including four different Bitcoin implementations, which the platform supports right out of the box. 
Eris lets you do cool stuff with Bitcoin in combination with other stuff at the same time, like IPFS, Ethereum, BigChainDB, Tendermint, and DataMarmot 3000.

[Project Douglas]( is now [Eris Industries]( We are currently following an independent development path.

I agree. We have [such a project, which we launched ten days ago]( and [we have working software]( which is ready for developers to play with - right now, today, free of charge (no token presale, no purchase necessary, and 100% open-source) - as well if you're interested.
Our first DApp built on the platform will be out in about two weeks. Think Popcorn Time with a Bitcoin content creation incentivisation function. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 13:34:46
We know devs don't want to see any of that but - as we're not running/selling a cryptocurrency - we have to speak to a pretty broad base. Here's a video that's a little more straight-up.

Just sayin'. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:24:49
Thanks Taariq :) I think a better way to put it might be this - open-source blockchain technology is a series of ideas, each following from the last, where we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us. 
Eth and Eris are written to address differing design goals- theirs, a fully decentralised platform, ours, something built exclusively for developers.
We thus were compelled to look at different design ideas, and that meant definitely **not** rolling a cryptocurrency and rolling a dev-friendly cryptocurrency-agnostic database technology instead.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:40:24
I disagree with this article in that I don't think the world necessarily needs more cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin does that just fine. 
Nor does it need pay-to-play systems where computation is run on dedicated servers and billed to end users.
 What it does need are more secure ways we can communicate with each other on our own terms, without needing to rely on centralised systems or faraway corporations - and by relying on voluntary provision of disk space and processing power, instead. 
Blockchains as a pure database technology can provide distributed (if not decentralised), cryptographically-secure utilities that talk to Bitcoin, BitTorrent, and other distributed protocols, and break down silos so that these protocols can talk to each other. Instead of disintermediating banks, Crypto 2.0 will disintermediate all kinds of other services - including servers.
As we're not selling anything or asking the community for money, I have little problem pointing out that my company, Eris, has released a free to use, open-source DApp platform (not a cryptocurrency) which will allow people to build [blockchain-based applications]( The blockchain component is based on Ethereum tech - except entirely free of charge, no token purchase required. 
The blockchains hold the application logic, and devs can roll as many chains as they like, over which they are free to set any parameters they wish and are in total control, without paying us a dime. We've also got some useful dev tools, including a comprehensive smart contract testing environment called [EPM]( which will allow you to test your smart contract suites pretty straightforwardly.
Feel free to [try it for yourself]( The platform's built to work with Bitcoin (and BTCD so you can run a full node on it); any other protocol (e.g. HyperLedger or BitTorrent) can be integrated into it by simply writing a module wrapper (it's modular). Our first DApp (coming out in two weeks or so - we'll be open-sourcing the code the moment it's done) will be a distributed YouTube with a Bitcoin payment module - just a few steps away from doing full-on Bitcoin-enabled distributed DRM.
We of course have our [own subreddit as well]( for any specific discussion on what we do - no need to clog up going forward!
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:56:11

@_date: 2015-01-03 19:53:34
I'm not disagreeing that distributed service layers are a good idea - only that rolling one's own brand-new cryptocurrency is not an ideal way to go about it. Blockchains are a database technology, pure and simple - of which Bitcoin is one very well-known and widely-used application. 
Software applications are structured differently to do different things. So should blockchains be - they have uses outside of a strict cryptocurrency context (public records e.g. Factom for example) for which tokenisation is extraneous and unnecessary in most commercial contexts.

Nuance ahoy:
There are a lot of advocates and detractors of Bitcoin. There are very few who are fond of it and try to highly objective in their analysis. For [well over a year]( I've been following the latter approach. 
In trying to get the idea of blockchain-without-cryptocurrency more widely understood (and to get people to understand how and why such a data structure might be useful), we have to explain why Bitcoin or other database technologies might not be the most ideal solution for those use-cases. This rubs a lot of people the wrong way - which is disappointing but inevitable, given that many generic blockchain use-cases have already been named as possible Bitcoin use-cases (for example as a backbone for global IoT infrastructure, or any other kind of transaction - given proposals to  scale Bitcoin up to handle [most of the world's transactional volume]( 
People thus view the tech as competitive when in fact it's just a new database tool in developers' arsenals, and complementary to Bitcoin's mission of decentralisation in that (a) it allows people to have reliable interactivity without servers and (b) can be plugged into the Bitcoin blockchain when needed or relevant (as we have done with the [Bitcoin tipping function]( in our distributed YouTube tech demonstrator). The approach isn't "anti-bitcoin" at all - it just saying that the stuff we have come to like about blockchains can be used for all manner of other things. 
Unfortunately, implicit in any such statement is that Bitcoin might not be the best solution for that particular thing, which raises people's hackles (even though it shouldn't). Ultimately, we built the tech for everyone - it's FOSS.

I think Andreas' tweet related to our back-and-forth on Twitter, not a formal sit-down. 
Bitcoin and developer-chains are not mutually exclusive propositions. I'd encourage you to listen to the interview - an hour with Andreas and Adam - which will give you a better perspective on what we're trying to do at Eris. 
It's a free, open-source [developer toolkit]( for people to use, not a dragon that needs to be slain (in your words).
@_date: 2015-04-05 19:31:40
Not really - I just state my mind. 
The point I was trying to make (which Twitter didn't adequately encapsulate) was that asking Bitcoin to do everything wasn't the best way to use it. We prefer to take a hybrid approach - see [this article from Bitcoin Magazine]( where the author nails it: Bitcoin does one function, app-specific distributed ledgers are built for other (infrastructural, non-currency) functions. 
They're not mutually exclusive propositions. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 18:15:53
Nope, it's just you two (I can go get the logs - starting from January - if you like). Repeatedly trolling a legitimate business on Reddit is not a great way to get people to want to help you out.

Although I appreciate your "concerns," rest assured we have a very firm commercial handle on what we're doing. Blockchains are not appropriate for everything. They are, however, very appropriate for the needs we have identified for them. 
We are not in the habit of screaming about our customers' use-cases, or those under development by independent developers who have approached us in confidence for assistance in using the stack. We are satisfied it addresses their needs. As the code for the stack is open-source, and costs nothing to use, you are most welcome to think creatively about what kinds of things a smart contract-capable chain might be able to do that a SQL database cannot and experiment yourself in solving real commercial problems, for which Bitcoin and other decentralised-by-default protocols are sub-optimal at best. 
And if you should like assistance in using it once you have conducted this analysis, we should be happy to afford you the same treatment as we have afforded the others. Which I'm sure you'll be very grateful for if you're planning to build a business around it.

[Thanks for the free advertising.]( Not sure why this belongs on though. 
Also, your definition is dated. Smart contracts are the cryptographically verifiable execution of code over cryptographically verifiable data. They have nothing to do with value.
@_date: 2015-03-18 14:19:03
[Here is an explainer]( which might help flesh that out. 
Basically, every function of a given chain (from committing new blocks to even the ability to transact) can be controlled by signing an transaction with a private key. We say the Thelonious design is not merely smart contract capable, but also smart contract controlled - because you can parameterise anything you want a chain to do with a [system of smart contracts]( you can specify access permissions with a much higher degree of specificity.
@_date: 2015-03-18 13:58:12
Hi, Preston Byrne - a (co-)founder here. 
I think people should do whatever they want to do with whatever database networks they use. Bitcoin is an application - and it is a currency, among those who use it. If people want to use it for that purpose, they should. 
Where I take issue with cryptocurrency is how everyone thinks every application that uses a blockchain-based distributed architecture needs an associated coin. The purpose of Bitcoin is to *be a coin.* So a coin is appropriate. Other applications have other purposes, so their security and permissions architecture should be different. 
It's likely that distributed applications can probably find some use from decentralised money. We built Eris to allow this (or indeed to talk to any distributed database in the context of a single application). For example, our first distributed application tech demonstrator, a YouTube-style distributed video app called [2Gather]( has a Bitcoin tipping function built-in. 
In the most general sense, however, blockchains *are* just distributed authentication databases and they are software. So we can tell them to do exactly what we want them to do, structure them to do other things, and behave in other ways, than Bitcoin - pub/privkey architecture and blockchain-style transaction management have other uses. 
Eris is a dev platform that allows people to explore what those uses are, experiment with other structures, and other applications, without 
* needing to burden Bitcoin with a bunch of extraneous additional data, or
* paying anything to anyone,
to solve the big problems they see in the world. It's free and open-source, so have fun!

Actually, [it probably is.](
If you want to know why, though, I am afraid you will just have to [RTFM.](
EDIT: Actually: I'll be nice here. Per Satoshi: "The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes."
Eris is the same. Except you can set the blockchain to only accept blocks from nodes with certain private keys. So if a "dishonest node" attempts to sign a block, and they don't have the right key, the blockchain rejects it - much in the same way it would reject someone attempting to spend a Bitcoin balance with the wrong private key. 
Adding a block in Eris world can be a private key-protected write permission. This is how you secure a blockchain without a great deal of hashpower. Bruteforcing a private key is in principle harder to do than marshalling enough processing power to fork Bitcoin. There are other workarounds (in both cases), but you get the idea.
How one distributes the processing power in a given system is a question of what works best for the application in question. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 19:31:42

Enlightenment may be found [in the repo]( 
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:19:33
The reason we built [Eris]( is so people could build their *own* internet of things. Blockchains are software - they will do exactly what we want them to do, no more, no less. As a consequence, we can do things like [contain their consensus parameters to pre-specified nodes and/or set up an administrator]( which allows us to obtain the benefit of networked interconnectivity - without relying on the big centralised service providers. 
Arguably Bitcoin itself has been plagued by this problem as well, with big service providers/Silicon Valley VCs exercising disproportionate influence over it in its role as a utility. There is no reason at all that a group of people could not, or should not, set up value transfer systems of their own without full-openness and with more defined parameters (see, e.g., the [Brixton Pound]( as one example of a pure currency application which still has economic value - and could use a blockchain - but has no need, of necessity, to use Bitcoin or competitive open mining).
When you take the cryptocurrency out of the equation (cryptocurrency here meaning a blockchain which uses a token reward as the sole incentive for securing the network - one security model, when a great many others are possible), you see that it's possible to have millions of blockchains - each managing the communications/data problem they were designed to address - not merely a few hundred dealing in financial value only. 
In my opinion that's a pretty powerful proposition. We make it possible to roll your own chain along these lines - free of charge (now and always). Go and [try it for yourself this weekend!](
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:47:55
Indeed. It's [utility use-cases like this]( which we're aiming at over at EI. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:03:19
Depends. If you had the blockchain as a fully-open Ethereum clone, then yes, that'd be a problem. However, we use a blockchain as a backbone for application logic - meaning that you can control what users do once they register on the blockchain. 
This goes all the way down to controlling whether someone is able to register a keypair, to whether someone can transact, to whether they can commit ("commit" being our term for "mining"), to whether they can add smart contracts to the chain - whatever you like. The blockchain not only houses smart contracts, but is controlled by them. 
This means that, provided your application's logic allows, you can even change those parameters over time. So, e.g., if you initially specify that Nodes 1-100 can mine, and Node 72 begins acting up one day, if you've set an admin parameter in the genesis block smart contract you can write a new tx to the blockchain, signed with your admin private key, which will instruct the other nodes to kick Node 72 out of the system. And they will. 
Pretty cool, huh?

Blockchains are networking tools. They're not supposed to have value or staying power - they're supposed to be useful.

There are plenty of good reasons to discuss that tech here. Distributed applications benefit from a decentralised global currency - we built [a version of YouTube]( which was designed to be stood up as a distributed network, independent of Google's centralised architecture, and planned to add Bitcoin functionality so people could tip for good content. We never got around to the last piece due to other priorities, but there's no reason it couldn't be done. I think there's a real benefit to considering how Bitcoin tech and blockchain tech can interact. 
Thus making each of bitcoin and "blockchain" more useful. 


Re (2), [sure]( Re (1), production-ready systems are a little way off. Recall that permissioned blockchains have been in existence for little over a year, so (a) adoption and (b) iterating towards production will take a little time. Even a new iteration of MS Word takes several years.


The "snake oil" comparison doesn't apply, imv, for two reasons: (a) BigchainDB [gives their tech away for free]( and (b) anyone developing with a FOSS database is wearing big-boy pants and can decide for themselves whether the BigchainDB alpha solves a problem they have. If it does, great. If not, fine. The people they're selling services to (system architects) will be amply capable of assessing its usefulness.

We're not trying to replace a DHT with this software, for the 50th time. It's for application logic. Furthermore I don't have a problem with Bitcoin's chain. Bitcoin is excellent at what it does for people who need to do what it does. 
We find the blockchain data structure to be highly efficient at the automation of process, including clearing and settlement, which it is excellent for, as you pointed out. However, people should not be forced to use Bitcoin to benefit from the efficiency of a blockchain data structure in the automation of process, whether in a clearing capacity or in any other function.
With or without Eris, the "blockchain without cryptocurrency" is not a concept which can be put back in a box as our software has been open-sourced. We will continue to improve it and people may use it to solve any problem they like. Let time be the judge of who is right.

It's a shame they are a topic of interest because of perceived competition rather than the fact that they're useful tools in business. The overlap between a Bitcoin consumer and a blockchain consumer is very nearly zero (one is a consumer proposition, the other is pure B2B).
