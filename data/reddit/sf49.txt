Then why do they ask for donations using the same address?

No they weren't. They released an official statement yesterday saying they weren't and the crash was due to their "success". lol

Yes and it's annoying. The rules need to be updated. No bs memes and no more, "omg gais, we did it, btc is now XXX".

They deserve the majority of the blame. The least they could've done was put up a warning message during the crash on the website. I didn't see anything explaining what was going on, all I saw was everyone on Reddit speculating a ddos attack. Hours after the crash they come on Facebook and released a statement, and they have the balls to talk about their success, lol.

I could have sworn there was a 16mil transfer not too long ago.

Just tanked to $140 o_O

So the official statement MTGOX made about it not being a ddos is a lie?
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:55:31
No. The true headline should be "The Bitcoin market can be manipulated by outside sources".

New low of $55 according to btc-e, selling around $70ish! MtGox destroying the market for a second day in a row.

It would obviously be adjusted with market prices.

Because adopting a dog isn't for everyone.

It's something most will poke fun at, but if it can help one person, it's worth it.
