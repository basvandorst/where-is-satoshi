Well shit, I'm blocked from playing in the US. I'll send it back to ya.
Edit: Just sent back. Thanks anyways. :)

I'm game.

Go to cryptocompare.com and plug in your info. What do you get?
Use their mining calculator or just google bitcoin mining calculator. Most stay pretty up to date.

Yes, take a look at spells of genesis. It uses the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:41:11
Just be careful, some credit cards may treat it as a cash advance with higher interest I believe.

I really like Gemini since they pre-credit your deposit for trading. Just can't withdraw until it clears. I also use uphold as they have been good. 
Will never use conbase again...3+ days and still no response on ticket.

I just made the mistake of using coinbase. I added and was using debit no problem. I then just tonight added my usaa bank account which i thought of all would be good since usaa has incorporated adding and viewing coinbase accounts. Nope, my account is now blocked from buying even after going through extra verification. I just started verification with gemini, done with coinbase. Also ive used uphold which has been good as well. Coinbase is just too sensitive i think. They rely on what their prevention software says and dont care about being honest and helping you out when they know thier shit software is wrong. I really do miss circle, they were really good imo...

Welcome to the club. A few months ago I was able to get verified and link my bank account. As soon as I tried to buy $20 worth I got those emails. After a few of them I asked to have my account reviewed and they said I could not buy from them...ever (Literally). I still have that support email. LOL
It's crazy since I'm verified and buy from circle, virwox, bitfinex. No issues at all.
I got tired of hearing the "oh it's our software" excuse. So I just cancelled my account and haven't been back since. They won't even work with you or at least didn't for me.
I would at least have liked to know why. They won't tell you either. Maybe it's certain states in the US, dunno tho.
Good Luck...

I gotta say I really appreciate you doing a review like this. This will help others be more informed with these clones. I honestly was wondering about this clone and how it stood up against the Trezor security wise. That's so crazy the things you outlined. I'm really super happy that I own a Trezor since you guys have put so much into it. I got mine by mining at the beta pool for 3 days for 79.99. To me that was a really great deal and even paying 119 is still worth it to me since bitcoin security is very important to me.

Welcome to the club. I was buying for weeks with a debit but was blocked despite passing second verification after adding my bank. Just got setup on Gemini over the weekend no problem. Coinbase is too sensitive. I also use uphold with my debit which has been good to me as well. Unfortunately I can no longer recommend Coinbase. I haven't heard back from them yet either. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:19:19
Yep sure enough. Clicking on buy now fills in the promo code. Nice find... :)
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:29:54
Yes I would. So far it has been good although it's only been a few days on there for me. They allow your bank transfer for instant trading as well. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:43:21
No need to worry right now. There arent enough unlimited clients to pull the chain away from core. Its not a seperate coin unless enough clients mine to fork the chain off into unlimited. If that happened then there would be a core chain and an unlimited chain both with bitcoins on them. Then there would need to be a decision on which chain to support.

@_date: 2017-03-15 00:43:54
No... Have you put in a support ticket? If not you should do so, they are pretty good about responding. It wasnt over your daily limit was it?
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:03:20
I'm running mine on a raspberry pi 3 with a 250gb USB storage drive. Runs great, low power consumption.
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:41:23
It's automatic. You can instantly trade your deposit, you just can't withdraw it until it clears the bank. It's a nice feature.
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:11:55
  
I followed this exactly except when it came to the part where you use git to download the source I just made sure I used 0.14.0 for the version.
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:09:19
Shouldnt take long. Did you check your email? They send a final confirmation you need to click after withdrawing by default.
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:34:54
- deposits are credited right away for trading. Can withdraw after clearing bank
- cheaper to buy
- customer support is way better
- cancels orders left and right for god knows what reason
- suspends your account whenever for god knows what
- takes days/weeks for support response
- considerable markup compared to current price
- blames everything on their fraud prevention software
- doesnt seem like any humans are left running the show
You always run the risk keeping coin on any exchange. Move it to a wallet you control whenever you can...Period...
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:33:25
Should be under settings/preferences "Bitcoin Network Fee Policy".
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:26:17
The faq on the site has upgrade info.  
Also just to save you some time if running on the raspberry. I had an issue running for more than 48 hours. After research the following fixed it for me.  
Set in bitcoin configuration file if you have issues.  
dbcache=64  
maxmempool=64  
Been running 4 days straight now. :)

Really awesome, nice and easy to get free sticker. No payment info required and free shipping too. I'll be buying a t-shirt soon. Thank you.

Lol this is crazy. I traded several hundred for a few months then cashed it out yet they saying i made 32k. Did they generate this using today's price and not what it was worth during those months? I was only playing with .3 btc and yet in march i made 8k during that month? Doesn't seem correct. I think i need to download my transactions and load them into one of the bitcoin tax sites. But my concern is will the irs question this based on the current 1099? Wtf gemini? Looks like they also counted the same btc several times being transferred in and out. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:57:34
Are you running the latest multibit wallet? Have you tried to do a repair wallet from the tools? This will resync with the blockchain which might help.
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:08:27
I'm running a full RPi3 node and I usually see 30-40 connections at any given time. I just checked and I'm at 34 right now. Does your RPi3 have good uptime with little interruptions? Mine is up 98-100% of the time and is usually in the 100-400ms latency range according to the bitnodes stats.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:55:29
I use gemini since they pre credit your deposit so you can at least trade with it. You just can't withdraw the btc until the bank transfer clears.
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:16:17
During setup of a trezor or any hardware wallet you write down a seed. This seed is what you keep safe at all costs. Keep it in a physical safe. If you lose the actual device you can buy a new one and restore your keys using the seed and all your coin will be there.
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:01:57
Just to let everyone know. If you are looking for an OTG adapter to use trezor or similar with your phone, this one works perfectly. No issues using the trezor with greenbits on a G-Note II. :)

Don't open it. I got one from a different address. Likely something malicious.
@_date: 2015-02-13 00:18:06
What area are you selling them in? Id buy some with bitcoin.
