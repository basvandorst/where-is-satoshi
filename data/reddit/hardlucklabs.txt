Constantly over writing data is what wears SSD's down. Since bitcoin is WORMy (write once read many) you don't have anything to fear unless you plan on constantly deleting and redownloading block history.  As for the writes themselves,  the write cache in front of the non-volatile ram is already batching up writes for you.  Blockchain data is really a non-issue on SSDs.

Paid extras should include an escrow service and bundled legal services for arbitrage of breach of contract.

disclaimer: I haven't followed the MuSig work nor do I live on chat channels where this stuff is actively discussed.
It would be nice to see some kind of explanation for core's outright rejection of ed25519 / curve25519 for aggregated signatures.
The guys at Evernym had a solid looking proposal for [BIP32-Ed25519]( which I never really saw counter-analysis for, much less from core. I'm not a cryptographer, but it seems that their effort to maintain ed25519 compatibility in their scheme would also maintain HD wallet compatibility with aggregated signatures.
The unsettling kick to Bitcoin's nuts is that there are effectively no active counter-proposals for an ed25519 backed implementation of threshold signatures. Given that Segwit is only at 40% adoption, this latest techno-wonder from blockstream feels like 2015 all over again.

It sure as hell does qualify as Godwin's Law, because you can't talk about Weimar Republic without acknowledging Hitler and the conditions that produced German led fascism.  Powerful it was not.
You are laughably wrong, and it's you that's trolling my comments.  Weimar's hyperinflation was due to their economy being in complete post-war shambles. Between war reparations, a total loss of exports, a refusal by other nations to lend them money, and finally the US crash of '29 that wiped out what was left of German capitalists foreign holdings, they decided to start printing money. And print they did. They kept printing and printing until their currency was worth nothing. I don't think you can call such idiocy inflation. Maybe the technical term is accurate, but their decision to run what was left of their economy directly into the ground falls to the inability of their government's leadership to stage a post-war growth plan that meaningfully engaged the public for their help. Had they done that then WW2 would not have happened.  Hitler's was the first Troll Army.
Ironically (and it's a very bitter irony), it was Keynes that grew the US economy after '29 and staged it for successfully financing WWII after realizing that the Europe would fuck up literally everything they touched after leaving the gold standard.
Before Hitler took power it was Germany's own conservative foolishness that made everything decidedly worse by enacting full-stop DEFLATION based economic policies.  Too little, too late - deflation didn't just undermine the currency, it undermined the valuation of businesses, balance sheets, and the only thing they could really count on before: land.  They over-steered their economic car sideways, one direction, then hit the gas to over-correct it in the other. The rest is morbid history.

IMO Linux is quickly becoming a consortium of the top tech companies, and no small part of that is driven by cloud computing (esp networking &amp; container automation)  by Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.  None of that development is predicated on their control over hardware, really. Data center density comes from chassis and integrated board designers. The chips themselves remain open, but keeping various remote-hands and "secure boot" backdoors off generally available system boards is getting more and more difficult.   
Red Hat is now IBM. MySQL is now Oracle. BTC FOSS contributions could easily mirror the corporate world as finance companies enter the stage as mainstream technology providers and not simply IT consumers.  That could be driven by a number of things - Fintech's success in making inroads against traditional business models, a coming backlash against hyper-centralized cloud infrastructure, and the necessity of putting R&amp;D back on the budget to remain competitive.   
If this happens, BTC core could easily be swamped by an influx of contributions from global financial companies, and no amount of social media trolling will stop it.  Keeping eyes on the software side of the process is much more critical IMO.

I agree. But the other side of this coin is bitcoiner mantra to "hodl" and wait for deflation to wipe out their debt.  That too is a very, very unlikely scenario. 
In the bigger scheme of things, western economies are driven by personal debt, and that is a private enterprise run by banks. Banks lend to people who want money to buy or create property. It's not the government that is driving up personal debt, it is individual greed. If you don't have enough money for a new car (which has more electronics and software tech now than an 80's era space shuttle) or a newly built, energy efficient house then you gotta go to the bank. Uncle Sam didn't make any appointments with loan officers. People are to blame for personal debt. We socialized the losses of banks after they in turn had made hundreds of billions worth of bad bets on irresponsible people. After the instruments valuation fell through the floor, it became a trillions sized problem. 
We can call the 2008 crisis the result of "predatory lending" or we could blame it on individual irresponsibility in understanding basic personal finance (my inclination as liberalism loving free range man-chicken). Whichever side you come down on doesn't matter - the 2008 crash was not due to monetary inflation.  Consumer purchasing power and lending rates were strong prior to the crash but a large class of people were losing their jobs and therefore losing their asses ... to the banks. Why? Just checkout the consumer lending growth prior to the 2008 crisis, documented nicely here: 
Page 20:  from 2001 consumer lending rate of 550 billion to 2008 rate of 850 billion. 
 
Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) failed as an asset class because the revenues that supported their values were decimated in a quietly growing population of foreclosures and personal bankruptcy. If a company doesn't have any income, it's not worth anything. Same for MBS. No mortgage payments. No value. Tens of thousands of homes sitting vacant or full of families unable to pay their mortgage. 
Personal greed is what wrecked the economy. It's not a popular opinion, but I think Satoshi used the crisis to drive interest to bitcoin, a vanity product. I really don't believe any longer that the protocol was created in response to it. The hard money myth is regressive, knuckle dragging political theology - but it keeps people trading and hodling and that, in turn, pays the bills for a lot of people trying to do good with it. 
The popular narrative now of bitcoin as a "reserve currency" is to me an acknowledgement from the Merklized Powers that Be that deflation will never work. Unfucking the fractional reserve through Nakamoto consensus? I can dig it. That's where we're headed.
@_date: 2019-04-17 06:53:41
I think you're incorrectly assuming a zero-sum game.  Look at the "debt" that the US incurred from the 2008 financial crash. Swift government action got the economy back on its feet inside of 18 months.   
[  
Do I like it? Hell no. I hated it. I hate it now. But the fact remains that it worked as designed. The climate for SMEs is hostile, and the market for IPOs was decimated, zapping the personal wealth of tens of thousands of Americans waiting on their stock options to be worth something for companies that are worth billions and still run privately. But that's orthogonal to the role that debt played in avoiding a much longer and much deeper recession than what we had.

Well armed militaries will keep things rolling just fine without bitcoin. What cryptocurrency folks refuse to understand is the degree to which Keynesian economics works, and how it works. The ability to lend and borrow against oneself and to repel economic and/or physical attack is part and parcel to modern nation states. China and the US both have little to fear from self-assigned debt, and everything to gain from hundreds of billions invested in energy R&amp;D, defense technology, and space exploration.

Great question.  Strictly my opinion:  anonymity was simply too difficult of a problem on its own at the time to bundle with an already difficult to understand protocol. Getting the experiment off the ground with enough activity to prove the value of Nakamoto consensus was difficult enough on its own without confusing the tech with an overlaid anonymity tool. The legal aspects were secondary, but still beneficial: if the user screwed up, the G men still had a cookie trail to follow, taking some of the heat off the technology and off of the developers. After a few years this policy seemed to work: to allow bitcoin networks to grow it was better to give the authorities something to play along with rather than something to force ISPs to ban immediately.
At the time when Bitcoin was released, companies were still being very careful around export restrictions in cryptography. DHTs we not widely used outside of torrent, and governments were very active in going after torrent developers and site facilitators. Wikileaks was launched in 2006 and the practice of torrenting encrypted files or even using scp with encrypted data made a lot of people very nervous. Before TOR was popular it was very difficult (and expensive) to gain access to relay networks with sufficient hops to anonymize your traffic.  Security-by-obscurity was the norm 10 years ago.
Today, by those standards, we're bathing in highly advanced and publicly available cryptography. Coins like XMR and ZEC aren't so unique on their own and governments have a much better idea now (along with sufficiently developed methods) to determine what groups have enough expertise to weaponize the tech versus some teenager trying to score a little weed.

I came across a new-to-me term the other day - "collapsitarian".  This term is accurate for those who are fearful, if not just resigned in a state of apathy,  to crashing spinning plates scenarios. 
The problem with collapsitarianism is that these doomsday scenarios are impossibly unlikely.  To promote this is to just give in to the idea that political change has to emanate from a fringe movement, either by force of conviction or force of arms.  I disagree with that.   
If we want a peaceful world that's true to classical liberalism, we simply have to keep our heads down and promote the use of bitcoin in everyday business, especially internationally.  A fast growing middle class powered by a state-less currency is an incredibly strong political consensus in direct opposition to the status quo.

Then he makes a leap and says it's time to try the bullshit behind curtain B).  I don't know why I should trust computer modeling anymore than insane mathematics. Sociologists have certainly been trying now for some 30 or 40 years - as a profession, the indefatigable applications of mathematical simulations have brought them no more closer to predicting inequality, unemployment spikes, increasing education levels, or ending poverty. Why do economists suddenly think that changing their approach will work now?   What I gather from the article is an academic struggle to remain relevant.

I stick with the term herd mentality over collectivism because I think it’s more accurate. People naturally want to optimize their life towards the lowest expenditure of resources for the maximum benefit. For the two hundred million or more that bother to register, voting in the two party duopoly and being a wage slave serves the purpose. It’s compatible with dense urban populations, gives rural folk a side to claim, pretends to do good deeds, and masquerades as an actionable pattern that defends rights and upholds justice. 
But it does none of these things. It’s an angry, fascist minority rule, bought and paid for to keep people from watching congress. If you disagree with something publicly then the threats come: for your job, for your reputation, for your family, or for your safety. Any means they can silence their detractors with state force can and will be pursued - relentlessly. 
Until we break the dollar they will only grow stronger.  The Republic will survive without a trillion dollar military or millions of so-called public servants on the payroll of the executive office, whose powers are wildly unchecked. 
Weak state, hard occupants. Without that no territory can maintain its sovereignty or shape its own identity. Multiculturalism isn’t the problem. Religion isn’t the problem. Open borders aren’t a  problem. Paralysis is the problem. Stick with the herd and hope for the best. Allay all those fears with your compliance. That’s how they do it.

The rise of the Internet, and subsequently, Bitcoin, has turned  the public / private debate on its ear.  Lefty economists still believe in markets, they just believe in setting rules around them that are public, rather than allowing unwritten, good ol' boys clubs to dominate the outcomes of deal making behind closed doors. 
There's been far more lost to corporate corruption in public markets than there ever was to regulatory controls.  Arguably, if it wasn't for the investor acts of 1933 and 1934, and the so-called "American Style" capitalism and trillions in market capitalization just wouldn't exist.  
When taxpayers led a 800 billion bailout program to banks, it was because of derivatives trading with no foothold in reality. When Glass Steagall was repealed and the dot-com bubble burst, it was because investment banks had incentives to P&amp;D bad IPO's, and at the same time exposed deposit holders in retail banking arms to the risks. 
The goal of any market should be to ensure a level playing field for all actors. Bitcoin and programmable sidechains have the potential to scale free market capitalism in ways we haven't yet seen, but there need to be controls to help it get there.  In short, we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
