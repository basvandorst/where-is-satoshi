What I have come to realise after so many bubbles and pops is that really, the news does not matter, the graphs will do as they will do.  We just accept the interpret the news to make the graph projections become a reality.  Small blurb from China, price dumps.  All the positives are just whiped away, because well, we were in despair phase.  But fear not I bought in at 29$ and saw it all collapse to 2$.  Then 266$ &gt; 55$ (my face still went white).

Newbies encountering Bitcoin often think a single unit (the bitcoin) costs them 1000$+.  My hope is that with a higher price the usage of mBTC will increase to help decrease this initial thought.  The significance of the title is more about there are actually 2.1 quadrillion units.

Imagine mining or searching was like opening 1/10 drawers.  You guessed right, you got some bitcoin.  The total amount of bitcoin mined is a constant over time, at the moment it's 25 bitcoin every 10 minutes.  That is for the entire network (all miners combined).  In order to make this constant as miners join or leave, the difficulty must adjust (more/less drawers).
So now you must check like a trillion drawers, but your quad core is only capable of checking 1 drawer / second.

@_date: 2013-12-29 01:25:22
Bitcoin protects against double spending by verifying each transaction added to the block chain to ensure that the inputs for the transaction had not previously already been spent.
In doing so, it removes the third party from the transaction, allowing for much lower (or no) transaction fee costs (which is fixed, wether it be 1$ or 100 million $), and, theoretically, at the speed of light.
This, in turn, finally provides a mechanism for microtransactions!
