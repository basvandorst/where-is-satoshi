Core's scaling solution will not be raising the block size. It will always be considered contentious by at least one of their devs so will not get merged in. If you want a block size increase, i suggest supporting another Bitcoin implementation that will scale in this way.

i'd have to assume that if the network decided to go with the Gavin patch / BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Core would also merge the pull request at that point and release a new version. Development would likely switch back to Bitcoin Core and we can all move on from this debate until we hit 8GB. :)

I agree that XT is a means to an end. It could help remove a bunch of fear if indicated the he intends to only make the blocksize change with XT.
I wish Gavin had gone through "proper channels" (as much as there is one): created a BIP and pull request, and then getting it rejected by the core devs before going public and getting community / business / miner support. Not doing this did not help his cause, though I understand not wanting to go through all of this just to be rejected. This could have removed a lot of the conversation about not following "the process." That said, there is a bit of game theory for him to figure out what is the best way to get the blocksize limit increased. I hope he knows what he's doing! :)
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:25:12
I think Bitcoin Core would merge in Gavin's pull request and release a new version of Core if Bitcoin XT gained consensus with miners and successfully forked the blockchain. With both code bases supporting the change, I think people would gravitate back towards Core being "Bitcoin." I do not think the intent of XT is to become the new Bitcoin Core - it is instead to push through this single change. I'd be curious if and would agree with this.
@_date: 2015-06-24 09:13:54

We have a couple of BIPs being worked on with Gavin having a pull request submitted. What happens when the Litecoin community decides to adopt one of these changes and Bitcoin won't? Will Litecoin suddenly become feasible as *the* "transaction" currency and end up following Satoshi's vision? As a Bitcoin Maximalist, i believe there will be only one digital currency and the "transactional" currency will also be the "store of value" currency. We're still in the early days of digital currency, and this decision will have a long term impact. It's been said many times that Bitcoin "could go to zero" - is this the thing that could make it happen? (BTW, I own no Litecoin.)

There may be a future where IoT agents are needing dozens/hundreds/thousands of transactions a second and every person potentially has dozens/hundreds/thousands of agents.

So far Bitcoin has mostly attracted a) people who love technology, b) libertarian minded people, and c) people that want to get rich quick.

Times definitely change, but Gox so far has been trustworthy not to steal coins and not to steal money. As bitcoin has matured, there are other exchanges with more than that to offer.  I'm guessing they will continue to not steal coins and not steal money.  That doesn't mean they couldn't be insolvent and actually not have the money/coins and declare bankruptcy.

The author never mentions confirmations in his article. He is completely missing how confidence is gained on the Blockchain. No one knowledgeable would suggest that a transaction worth millions of dollars can't be reversed after only one confirmation if an attacker could gain enough hashing power. But now try to reverse that transaction after it is 6 or 10 or even 100 confirmations deep - the cost of doing this quickly gets prohibitively high. Outside of state actors, i'd surmise we are already well outside of the ability of any corporation to run a shadow Bitcoin network that could reverse transactions that are more than a couple of transactions deep.

I definitely agree with what you said. But if, for instance, The Government convinces the Bitcoin community to install a backdoor that allows all new transactions to potentially be confiscated and sent to an address owned by The Government and that is what Bitcoin becomes, then so be it, that is what the community wants. And I don't think a hard fork now would have any influence on the above scenario. If enough of the community is convinced to do something, it will be done, and potentially by coercive means.
That said, the current Bitcoin community, definitely would not allow The Government to do such a thing. But if this sentiment changes in the future, there absolutely would be another cryptocurrency that did not allow The Government change. Part of the magic of open source and cryptocurrency is that because there can always another cryptocurrency that doesn't implement a change like this, it makes it easier for Bitcoin to stay true to what the current community wants it to be.

Do you think Core believes that the block size being full is sufficient reason to do a fork and raise the block size limit? A statement like that was definitely absent from their scaling roadmap (and I doubt it was unintentional). You should realize that there are two outcomes related to block size right now and they set the course for the future:
1. The blocksize does not increase and we'll see if there is a successful fee market. Once there is a fee market for miners, this will not be taken away or reduced (i.e. there will never be a blocksize increase).
2. The blocksize does get increased. Core (i'd say correctly) knows that if you increase the blocksize now with a fork, you will do it again in the future and maybe never stop doing it.

If a miner wants to do this at the expense of the usefulness of the network, sure. But the larger the miner, the more pressure they feel *not* to do things that will harm the network. They have enormous sunk costs in their mining hardware they want to recoup their investment on. And if they start behaving in a way that decreases the value of Bitcoin, they are the first to feel it (they need to pay for electricity with their Bitcoin every month).
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:15:05
A value protocol is a fair interpretation of Bitcoin. I'd definitely agree that there would and should be layers on top of it - and the more decentralized, the better. But smart people can disagree on what that layer 1 looks like, because eventually (and maybe now?) it's rules will be frozen in place.
And it would have been a paradox for TCP/IP to be designed by asking the Internet's feedback since the Internet didn't yet exist. :)

The intent of the miner fee (and it's continual decreasing amount) is to subsidize miners during the growth phase of Bitcoin. There is no need to force a fee market at this point for Bitcoin - let it continue to grow.

Yes, everyone should listen to experts and learn as much as they can, but just because some expert (or group of experts) believe one thing doesn't mean you must too. The blocksize debate is a series of tradeoffs and it's ok to disagree with smart people on what you think are reasonable tradeoffs.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:36:26
2MB is an upper limit. It does not mean blocks will immediately be 2MB, just like blocks are not currently 1MB while we have had a 1MB upper limit for years.
Many on Core have stated they are interested in seeing a fee market form right now. Bigger blockers would argue that a fee market should form when the block reward is no longer sufficiently subsidizing miners and we should currently let Bitcoin continue the same trajectory of growth we have already seen.
@_date: 2016-01-19 08:55:33
Hopefully most people can see that it is nuanced and there is no wrong or right. There is no mathematical proof for "decentralized enough."
What I do not agree with in Core's communication is that there is no way to know what exactly would cause a blocksize increase. I honestly cannot see any situation where their developers think the tradeoffs favor increasing the blocksize.
As someone who thinks that the block reward is currently doing what it is supposed to in Bitcoin's early growth phase (keeping transactions cheap to encourage the user base to grow), I do not think now is the time to change this behavior and we should instead keep the blocksize limit as a security/DOS measure, not an economic control.
Bitcoin Classic should make a statement about what their plans are for a future block size increase also. Right now I assume it's "we'll push for a new fork when capacity nears saturation" but I'd like them to be more explicit. Unfortunately, i think both Core and Classic are not being transparent about what specifically would cause a blocksize increase in the future.

This is a slippery slope fallacy and a block size increase is not indicative of anything else happening other than a block size increase.
Bitcoin should be what people want and there will be politics involved. I know you are very involved as a developer of Bitcoin and (hopefully) everyone appreciates that. But your "majority screaming against [a hard fork]" in the case of a block size increase is a majority of developers for the Core Bitcoin implementation. This is a very small minority of the total people / parties that are interested in the success of Bitcoin.
The best thing Core has done recently (politics-wise) is make a very clear statement on how they want to scale Bitcoin - and it does not include a hardfork blocksize change. This should make it very clear to users / miners / companies / whomever, that if they want a different roadmap, they should support a different implementation of Bitcoin. With other implementations of the Bitcoin software springing up, users can now support their ideas with actions instead of words. If multiple implementations of Bitcoin have traction, this will be one of the best things to happen to the decentralization of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-19 00:36:41
People are voting for compromise when they say the support Classic. The core devs, unfortunately, treat Bitcoin the same way as a problem in cryptography - either its 100% correct, or it is broken and shouldn't be done. Bitcoin is a series of compromises by everyone involved - including developers.

Having worked at many VC backed companies, understand that the investors want a return on their $21M and the board of directors is there to ensure that happens.

I'm going to eat my own words a little bit here ... from Greg Maxwell after the scaling conference: 


ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.
Greg very carefully chooses his words - 2/4/8 can be implemented "as the need and the will arises." This is such an ambiguous statement that it might as well say that Core will not ever do a block size increase as they alone are the ones entrusted by the community to determine need and will. How could someone other than the Core devs ever win such an argument based on "will"?

I'm not sure I understand your reference to Chinese centralization in regards to the conversation, but I don't think you know how VC backed companies work.
You don't invest $21M to create a profitable consulting company. VC investors are usually looking for a 10X return in a relatively short amount of time. Once you take VC money, they will provide a lot of the direction a company takes - founders no longer have full control. Many founders have disagreed with the direction of the board of directors and have left a company they started or been forced out.

Unfortunately, I don't recall core ever trying to get users' feedback and taking that in to account.

Mentioning a price drop is an appeal to emotion. No one in the community wants to see that.
Do you honestly think that right now, in 2016 that a fee market is required to sustain the POW that we have? Satoshi created Bitcoin with a miner reward that drops over decades. So far, this has gotten Bitcoin to being worth near $6B in only 7 years - we've got a long way to go. If there was a consistent drop in mining hash rate, a lot more people would think that a fee market is necessary now.

The intent of "big blockers" is not to thwart any kind of development of other technologies that allow Bitcoin to scale. It is an attempt to not change the economics of Bitcoin from what it has been the last 7 years (i.e. create a fee market). The block reward was intended to subsidize miners in the early days of Bitcoin's growth - which I hope we are still in.
I'd imagine that the majority of "Big Blockers" are all for SegWit and Lightning, but do question Core's prioritization of these technologies over what is a straight forward code change (2MB hard fork) to keep the same Bitcoin economics. Note that SegWit allows a one-time-only increase of additional transactions per block and Lightning could take years to reach critical adoption (if at all).
Some of the Core devs have said that they are ready for a Fee Market right now. You can agree with their technical prowess and still disagree with the economics they are choosing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-19 07:04:52
You aren't listening to what Core is saying at all. They want to build a fee market for transactions. To do that, you need limited block space. They want Bitcoin to hit the block size limit.
Any increase will not happen as the result of code from Core. But i hope if consensus of the network forks, they will apply a patch to keep Core validating blocks the same as the rest of the network.
@_date: 2016-01-19 04:34:48

Presumably all of the exchanges will support Classic as it fits their business model. SPV wallets will work with Classic without change (i think) since they follow the longest chain.

There is a lot of room between "a single server farm" for Bitcoin and "every wallet is a full node." There is no need to insinuate that anyone interested in Bitcoin wants to increase centralization. 
Reasonable growth in blocksize has been part of Bitcoin since it's inception. If additional technologies (SegWit, Schnorr Signatures) can help slow that growth, that is great for Bitcoin. But having an arbitrary limit (which we are now at) limits Bitcoin's growth potential.
@_date: 2016-06-14 08:26:03


There are lots of incorrect usages of "scalability" in this sub, and I feel you are being overly precise with the word to win an argument. I think most people interested in raising the blocksize limit (Rick Falkvinge included) want an increase in transaction *capacity*. SegWit provides this. Schnorr signatures can provide this. So does a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:54:38
Obviously you don't understand open source software. Anyone right now can go to  and click the "fork" button and have the "most well tested, efficient and feature complete implementation of bitcoin."
If the community (or parts of the community) don't like the direction of an open source software project, they can (and should) fork it. They get to start off exactly where the other repository left off. It's then up to that fork to build and maintain it's community.
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:03:37
As someone who believes the block size should be increased now, currently Bitcoin is primarily used for speculation / wealth preservation and not so much as a currency. This does not require dozens of transactions per day per person.
That said, if Bitcoin *cannot* be used as a currency due to excessive fees, Bitcoin may not have a long future.
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:45:40
I fear that we are pushing out usages of Bitcoin *as a currency* as the fees increase. Bitcoin should be the currency of distributed applications such as Open Bazaar - but with fees that could exceed that of eBay in the near term, that may never materialize. I'd prefer we keep fees low now while those distributed second tier networks such as Lightning are being implemented.

I don't disagree that what Satoshi may have thought years ago are not entirely relevant to the network that we have now. Bitcoin is a series of compromises that all parties involved are making.
But treating a fixed 1MB blocksize as a god-given limit that is unchangeable is the same as treating Satoshi's words as those of a deity. Bitcoin works because all sides are making trade offs. Blocksize, centralization, security, market value - it's a balancing act. Keeping the 1MB blocksize limit as blocks fill up changes the balancing act in an unforeseeable way.

Also I'm still waiting for your answer. Can you show me where Satoshi stated the limit was put in place to limit centralization (the OPs assertion)?
I highly doubt Satoshi was worried about centralization in July of 2010 when everyone was still CPU mining. It makes a lot more sense that he would be worrying about a solo miner creating a arbitrarily large blocks as an attack on the network.
And I'm not exactly interested what Satoshi's intentions were at the time - he is not able to predict the future any better than the rest of us. Sensible blocksize increases (previously via the soft limit) have worked well for the last 7 years and have created a thriving ecosystem.
Edit: Forgot to add the link to Satoshi's commit where he made the blocksize change:

This would also require miners to raise their blocksize soft-limit. I do not know what XT defaults this as, but this necessitates more than "someone." This would be unlike the previous stress test that created blocks up each miner's soft-limit in Core.

I'm not sure what kind of safety net you are talking about, but the soft maxblocksize limit could be considered a safety net on the size of block a miner chooses to include in a block. 8GB is a maximum size and far into the future (in Bitcoin / technology terms). Without qualifying that, you are making it sound like it's 8GB immediately (i'm not sure if that's your intent, but it's easy to read it that way).
@_date: 2015-09-17 04:06:41

If people don't believe we should change the 1MB max block limit because it requires a consensus change, that's a valid point of view (that I disagree with). But there is a lot of FUD around not supporting a block size increase saying it would cause the network to crumble. This pull request shows that a couple of years ago, we were ready to let the network effectively triple in block size without controversy (i.e. scaling the network was not controversial).

I have yet to hear anyone discuss a design flaw or hack possible on MtGox's website. So far I have only heard of BitCoin hacks via social engineering and compromised systems outside of MtGox's control.  I'd imagine these hacks are possible on all other BitCoin exchanges.
That said, MtGox now has large sums of real money in people's accounts where it did not just a couple months ago.  They haven't had much time to react to the increase in demand they are seeing.  As long as their development team focuses on site stability and security, I think they are doing a pretty good job.

I agree that this does not change the consensus rules, but a lot of the argument against increasing block size is not based on consensus rules, but is instead based on the network not being able to handle an increase in block size. This is a change which effectively triples the block size most miners can create.
You can actually see that most ~~pools~~ miners do not (were not) manually overriding the soft block size limit. Look at the average block size over the last 2 months which includes the "stress test":
The average block size does not go over 800,000 bytes even though there was an increasing queue of paid transactions in the mempool. If most miners/pools were using 1MB blocks, the average block size would have been much closer to 1MB.
Edit: Replace pools with miners

The link is the pull request by Gavin bumping the default from 250,000 bytes to 750,000 in ~~Nov~~ Nov/Dec 2013 (if i'm reading the code right).
As far as i know, _actual_ maximum block size has largely followed the default soft block size limit on Bitcoin Core (maybe except for the period after the recent "stress test" which showed that most miners were using the default 750,000 byte limit).
It's interesting how little "controversy" there is over effectively tripling how large most blocks ~~would~~ could be from miners. A lot has changed in 2 years.
Edit: Nov to Nov/Dec and would/could.

Assuming Bitcoin catches on, I doubt regular people will have their wallets on their local hard drive, just like I doubt most people with large sums of cash store it under their bed.  Right now, Bitcoin is suitable only for hackers - don't expect non-techies to start using it and doing all of the things we are doing now to back up our wallets.
There will be trustworthy services in the cloud.  If anyone wants to get ahead of the curve, i suggest creating a website to store bitcoin and not perform any transactions unless verified with an automated phone call/SMS.  I can also see such a service offering insurance against any loss from hacking.

From &gt; we should replace the 750K limit with a "go along with the crowd" rule that means any miner that doesn't care will create blocks that neither increase nor decrease the average block size.
I would like to see XT implement this rule (or something similar) for the soft blocksize limit.

Wuala looks to be missing what I think would make it cool - allow users to participate in the storage of files and get paid for that.  If Wuala added that, then it would be something new.  From what I see, it simply allows payment with Bitcoin.  I don't think paying with Bitcoin instead of USD is very compelling unless the service being offered is illegal, i.e. Silk Road.
Bitcoin allows something that wasn't possible before - getting paid for doing "something" in a totally peer-to-peer environment.  I think once the first service utilizing this idea is released, it will have a huge impact not only on Bitcoin, but on computing.

I never said increasing the blockchain wasn't controversial. I said that many in the Bitcoin community disagree with BS's decision not to support it, thus attempting to create a transaction fee market.
From what i've seen (i've been in this community for 5+ years now), this subreddit now has a tendency to downvote comments that are not in line with what Core has said - the same way \tends to downvote comments that agree with Core. Both subs are cirlejerky. It's hard to have a real conversation about such "controversial" topics without a downvote brigade. But that seems to just be the nature of reddit and probably a reason why many have left.
And while BS is obviously not the owner of the Core Github repo, i'm certain they did get their large funding round due to having a number of developers "in control" of the Bitcoin protocol. Of course, let the best ideas / software win. :)
@_date: 2016-05-19 04:46:47
*Wrong* is a strong word (even though it was my word - i was using it as an expression of speech), but the number one thing that i think most people would disagree with Core's actions is:
* Encouraging an economic change to bitcoin (i.e. creating a fee market for transactions due to an artificial limit in block size) while there is a substantial block reward subsidy that was intended by Satoshi's original economic model to pay miners until transaction fees alone could do so.
Is changing the economic model of transactions needing to have a market to pay for limited block chain space *wrong*? No. Is it something that people can (and possibly should) disagree with BS over? *Yes.*
If Bitcoin had already implemented something like the 2/4/8 that Adam Back suggested by this time, pretty much every complaint to BS's proposal would not be valid. Lots of Bitcoiners see BS as suppressing growth by changing the current (previous?) economic model. Most people in \simply want Bitcoin continue its growth same way it has over the last 8 years while we see what 2nd layer solutions will work.

Just like any open source community, certain developers will get their PRs approved more often. I have no issue with that. BS hired those developers from the Core repo. Again, I have no issue with that.
I did use some silly quotes for "in control" meaning not to take it literally - sorry if that was confusing. The Core devs that also work at BS have a huge _influence_ over the direction of the Core Github repo and the Bitcoin clients it releases. Because the Core client has the most history and strongest team of devs, they also have a huge _influence_ over protocol changes of Bitcoin. It makes sense that BS's investors are willing to back a company with a large _influence_ over the Bitcoin protocol.

@_date: 2016-05-19 07:58:20
Fair point - the two are definitely not synonymous. I would say that the intent of the above statement was more of a reflection of how this sub has a tendency to automatically downvote comments that are not in agreement with the BS devs that contribute to Core - even comments that _do_ add to the discussion.
And I absolutely agree that there are voices from Core that are not voices from BS - Peter Todd is an obvious (and quite vocal) choice. But there are numerous others.
I'm excited to see what happens with the HK agreement. Interesting times ahead - and probably lots more contention for the foreseeable future! :)

You seem to think Bitcoin can only be successful as a currency. That's far from the truth. If you read this subreddit, you'll notice only a few posts about transaction fees and a few posts about transaction limits. To the majority of Bitcoin users, this is not affecting them - they are more interested in speculation and Bitcoin as a store of wealth. Bitcoin's price vs fiat increasing is good for those interested Bitcoin as a store of wealth, but make it more difficult to use as a currency. It will continue to have periods where it is good at one and bad at the other. The Bitcoin network is agnostic to how people use it.

All of the talk about an altcoin being worth more because its "more scarce than Bitcoin" doesn't make any sense.
As an example, Apple has about [950M shares outstanding]( while Netflix has about [55M shares outstanding](  Netflix outstanding shares are 17X more scarce than Apple shares, yet Apple is worth 40X more than Netflix. Its like investors saying they won't buy any stock over $100 because its "too expensive" or saying a stock is a "good buy" only because its under $10.
This line of logic is part of what many of the altcoin adherents are doing to pump up the price. Its taking advantage of people's lack of understanding of markets.

And doesn't the faster transaction time increase the likelihood of orphan chains? (Someone correct me if wrong here - not trying to spread my own FUD.)
*"Bitcoins are too expensive for most people, so we need a less expensive alt-coin that everyone can use."* Either you believe in the "infinite" divisibility of digital currencies or you don't. If you believe in it, then there is no such thing as "too expensive" - there are always smaller units provided by Bitcoin.

I'm a big fan of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme  You split your wallet into multiple "shares" which can be printed or stored on separate media, then physically separated.  Its secure and requires no passwords.
For instance, you could split your wallet into 3 shares and require that 2 are needed to recreate your wallet.  You can then physically separate these shares with a parent/child, a safety deposit box, and a home safe.  This means that your parent/child could not recreate your wallet without also accessing either your safety deposit box or home safe.

We are are not at this stage yet for this very young currency where this will happen, but don't think that the current drawbacks in Bitcoin will be there forever.

Most people seem to be talking about the double spend that can occur during a split on the block chain (which the malicious customer cannot predict).  You seem more interested in the malicious customer quickly sending multiple conflicting transactions to the network.
Here is a relevant Stack Exchange post: 
Bitcoin peers *should* choose the first transaction they receive. If the POS is on a well connected node, it would be able to quickly see that a customer sent multiple transactions to the network.  In the time it takes for an IRL checkout, the POS could detect the duplicate transactions and notify the cashier.  What to do from there is a good question.

This is a bad idea. People will begin to expect that a transaction is reversible if they make a mistake. But that's not the case: the original transaction can always be accepted into the blockchain before the replacement transaction and therefore cannot be "undone."

Here is my offline/cold wallet generation:
1. [Create USB drive with Ubuntu installed](
2. Copy an offline address generator such as [bitaddress.org]( to a second USB drive.
3. Restart your computer and boot into Ubuntu (trial mode, not installation).  Do not connect to WIFI or other network.
4. Open your offline address generator and create some addresses.
5. (Printing): Connect your printer via USB to print your public/private keys. Ubuntu recognized my printer without problem. Put the printout in a safe place.
5. (USB storage): Save your public and private key pairs to your USB drive. Never connect this USB to a networked computer.
6. You probably also want to store only the public Bitcoin addresses to a separate USB drive so you can check the balance, etc. Its OK to connect this USB drive when you return to OSX since it only has public keys.

I don't think your second paragraph is correct (I would need a Bitcoin dev to point to the code).  The size of the transaction fee does not increase the odds that the transaction will propagate to more nodes or to nodes more quickly.  Instead, the connectivity of the node to other nodes in the P2P network determines how the transaction propagates.
For instance, if the malicious customer knows that the POS system is only connected to a single Node X, he can send a "correct" transaction A to Node X and a double-spend transaction B to Node Y.  Node X will add transaction A to his transaction pool and Node Y will add the double spend transaction B to his.  The Nodes will then both begin sending messages to the other nodes on the network announcing their new transaction.  Both transactions will spread throughout the network, but only one will be accepted into the blockchain.
If your POS is only connected to Node X, the malicious user could get your POS to report a transaction with low likeliness of getting added to the blockchain.  But if the POS is connected to a few well connected nodes, it should be able to determine with relatively good confidence that there is only a single transaction using an input.  If the well connected nodes report different transactions, the POS will know something nefarious is going on before the transaction ever enters the blockchain.
All of the propagation of the transaction through the network should take seconds.  The customer would still be right in front of you when you realize their wallet tried to do a double spend.

This isn't how Bitcoin works. Miners cannot determine who will get the next block so there can't be a standard that forces all miners to skip certain transactions (i.e. potential income) in certain blocks.

I kept waiting for Andreas to ask about Buttercoin's goal of "White Labeled Bitcoin Exchanges" basically being a single centralized exchange as a single point of failure. The Buttercoin project's initial goal of opensourcing an exchange where anyone could get the code and create an independent exchange reduced centralization. The new business model is the opposite of that and therefore opposite of a lot of the Bitcoin community's goals.  Andreas has previously been very vocally against centralization, but oddly didn't bring it up here.
Also, Andreas didn't call out Cedric for saying that other exchanges don't have good enough development teams to integrate the Buttercoin software. I doubt this is the case. Buttercoin is not a mature open source project, so i couldn't imagine any exchange already in business swapping out their existing platform for a new platform that may/may not live up to its promises. I wouldn't want to be first - and that has nothing to do with my coding prowess. And there very well are other issues such as the API may not be very good or difficult to use.  And how is the project's documentation?  What kind of support is provided?  In general, the tone of Cedric came off as arrogant and Andreas totally bought into it.

Fair point.  A 0 fee can cause a transaction not to be added to the blockchain.  But as long as your POS can see that multiple nodes have conflicting transactions for an input (i.e. an attempt to double spend), then your POS can notify a cashier not to let the customer walk out the door with a product.
I'm not sure what a store's policy should be when a 0-conf double spend *attempt* is detected.  But I would think if the detection is &gt; 90% accurate, it would eliminate anyone from even trying to do this - shoplifting might be a better move. :)

Sending a payment without a transaction fee does not affect how the transaction propagates through the Bitcoin network, it only affects if the miner chooses to add the transaction to a block.  All known clients will accept (i.e. add to their "transaction pool") the first transaction spending an input that they receive, not the one with the highest transaction fee.
If a POS has connections to a few well connected nodes, it would be possible to see if there are conflicting transactions in the different nodes transaction pools.  Of course, no check is perfect until the transaction has been sitting in the blockchain for a few confirmations. :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:58:57
A lower supply of bitcoin being used for spending does not affect its ability to be used as a currency due to its "infinite" divisibility. Bitcoin can be used as a currency if the price is $2/BTC, $200/BTC, or $200,000/BTC.  People may not *want* to spend due to hopes of a higher price in the future or due to price volatility, but as long as BTC has some value, no matter how small, it is useful as a currency.
Ask yourself a different question - what will cause Bitcoin to have a 0 value?  Where actually no one wants bitcoins.  I haven't found an economic answer to this other than a design flaws to Bitcoin itself.
BTW, early adopters have been "dumping" for years now. They sold on the way up to $2, on the way up to $30, on the way up to $260, and on the way up to wherever we are going now.  Its hard to know who has how many Bitcoin, but they are definitely being distributed to more and more people as the price rises - and even as the price falls.

AFAIK, the US government has not explicitly stonewalled Bitcoin exchanges. They are legal, but you have to deal with laws that vary state-by-state, pay expensive fees, and have a bank that is willing to work with the exchange.

Less volatility would also come from people moving their Bitcoin off of exchanges. Right now, due to the high barrier of "securing your wallet," many have decided that the safest place for their Bitcoin is to keep it on the exchange where they purchased it. That also happens to be the place where people can trade in a speculative manner. Imagine if 20% of all of the gold in the world was being held by a few exchanges with traders actively able to transfer from gold to fiat - you would see the same fluctuations in the price of gold.
Once there are better storage solutions and more ways to get bitcoin other than on an exchange, you will see less volatility in Fiat/Bitcoin price.

A web-based marketplace using BTC to pay for computing resources.  An exchange/website maintains available computing resources and their costs and matches them to people needing work/computations done.
As someone who needs computing, you partition your task into many parallelizable units of work.  You write all of your computation code in Javascript.  Once you know how many tasks, you look at the marketprice for these tasks, load your account with that amount of BTC, then submit the Javascript + data.
As a computing resource node, you go to the website, giving your Bitcoin payment address, then the website sends you a unit of work to be done in Javascript that matched the amount of BTC you expected to be paid.  Presumably you would want to using something like [asm.js]( (if it catches on) to be performant. Once you are done with that work, you move on to the next.

I hate to say it, but i don't think MtGox has the technical/business expertise to expand into new markets like this. They may be making a lot more money than a year ago, but it doesn't seem like they have grown their engineering team to match or moved on acquisitions of related companies (i.e. could they have acquired Dwolla a year ago?).
At some point in the not so near future, MtGox will be replaced by a company that knows how to grow a business to a much larger scale... especially with Silicon Valley VC money moving in.

I had my coins on MtGox for 2 years and have just recently sent them to a paperwallet (bitaddress.org). Honestly, i'm still a bit nervous that my paper wallet won't import for some reason (even though i tested the private key with BitcoinQT via its command line interface while "offline"). A private key that doesn't import would be a fun surprise in a few years.

I feel like we should be calling paper wallets "single use paper wallets."

Seems pretty reasonable.  But unless someone said the word "miner" to me, i wouldn't say it to them. The term "miner" tends to make someone's mind go in the total wrong direction - usually towards thinking Bitcoin is more of a computer game or not "real."

He's not so crazy here:   Doing his RT show, his job is to entertain. Decide for yourself if you are entertained.

Weird that this can't be done in a browser. Their website does some kind of infinite redirect on Chrome on my iphone during sign in.

If i am making a purchase, i totally agree. But if i am splitting a wallet, which I think is where most of the lost coins are occurring, i feel like it is equally visible the i have 100 coins in a single wallet or 50 coins in two wallets. I wonder a user interface specific to splitting wallets would help avoid confusion.

Yeah, i tried it about a month ago and couldn't get it to work on my mac. I only have a white belt in python-fu.

My guess is that he made a big purchase yesterday and now that he holds a lot of coins, he wants to pump the price.  If he were a true fan, he would be have been here on this subreddit or Bitcoin Forums evangelizing for the last couple of years.  When/if the price drops, he'll be one of the first to cash out.

Institutional investors are now aware of Bitcoin - and its weakness: the exchanges.  Bitcoin isn't ready to have 10 or 100 billion USD of value.  Maybe in a year or so, things will have changed and they'll be watching.
