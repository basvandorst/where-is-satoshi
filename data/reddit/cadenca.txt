7300 rejected hard this morning. But something seems a little different regardless. I'm not taking any profits from my 6693 long. Emergency stop at  6888, but for now let's be greedy.

Mark my words, we're going up today. I took a long slightly late at 10128 USD, but I have a good feeling. Very likely to correct further, but we will give it one more try today to go up. Let's go boys, one final time

How would you calculate the risk of using something like this? Might be a terrific site but it's a small exchange and nevaheerd for me at least.

Cuck foinbase. Can't blame them, that fee hike was atrocious

What an absolute idiot for selling now

Well, that was quicker than anticipated..

What an interesting dildo on bitcoin this morning. Did not expect that level to cause a rejection dump like that. Feels like a no brainer to long now from 8400, but I always get rekt with stop losses.

Now, it's worth noting that Friedman was quite a controversial figure in his time. In the 80's and 90's he made so many dumb predictions that never came true, it really affected his reputation. Hardly a visionary, but this video is alright.

I saw a Youtube video explaining how this statistic has historically been so accurate, the fact that we are nowhere near 2011 levels is very alarming. He did not expect us to have hit a low point even in December with Bitcoin at 3200 USD. Any arguments as to why now might be different?

Yes. He didn't sell in 2017, 2018 or summer 2019. If he had sold in 2017 or 2018 I would have 100% sympathy for him. But he survived them only to sell now? For him to give up at the literal bottom of a bull flag, before the halving in 2019 is inexcusable

But the priced in argument is that smart money has already bought in and accounted for that

Thank you! I will probably look up some articles on those attacks to cite them. After all, 51% attacks were long considered a theoretical threat, but this year has seen a few alone.

Last year crypto was in a deep depression though, the stock market crash amplified that. This time crypto is red hot, in a bull market and undervalued
