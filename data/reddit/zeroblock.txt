ZeroBlock aggregates news from media publications that break and write original content.  This also includes the reddit "hot" thread and Bitcointalk forums.  We do not qualify, nor endorse any of the media publications that are included in the news feed.  Scrapping a media publication's RSS feed typically drives traffic towards their website, so in return we require the media publication to place a "ZeroBlock Media Partner" link on their site indicating that they are in the ZeroBlock news feed.  This is simply to help drive traffic to our site.  We are explicit about paid advertisements, which are located in the clearly marked ZeroBlock "Promoted Article" slot.  We were not contacted by Tom Butterfield before he published this medium article and strongly rebuke his accusation that we are endorsing any media publications.  Also, we'd like to note that we have not received any monetary compensation from our media partners.

Even if you have an undetectable way to cheat, your output can't be masked (aka instant headshots faster than a human can move/sense).  And since funds are held in escrow, if anyone feels that there has been cheating it can be resolved easily.

I'm simply talking about the easily seen spread between exchanges, and I think that it is reflective of a serious problem.

Thats correct.  We did not expect that app to be approved this soon, nor did we expect the Forbes video to be released so quickly.  We will be putting up a nice web page over the weekend.  
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:10:33
"To be honest I'm surprised there isn't more prop money thinning the spread."
Haha ya because you can't get your fiat out.  Gox has ceased to function as an exchange you trade Bitcoin for USD vouchers, not actual USD.  Not to mention liquidity concerns, if you had fiat stuck at Gox when they file bankruptcy.  That's why there is a 10% spread.  
@_date: 2013-08-15 16:35:44

Mt.Gox hasn't processed almost any USD wires since June.  Users cannot transfer money out of Gox.  The spread represents the risk of holding USD in Gox.

The only person I would believe is an reputable auditor with an accounting background.  Printed bank statements and "letters from attorneys" don't mean anything.  If Gox had nothing to hide, they would be more transparent about the entire process.  
@_date: 2013-08-19 11:02:43
Precisely.

30 small orders executed by different individuals can't possibly assimilate into an organized number like 1,000 or 2,000 exactly.  The probability of that is astronomically small. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:56:12
We totally agree, we find that the most accurate way to show the natural movement of the price.  However, we're dependent on Clark Moody to supply us with those charts, but hopefully soon!

Couldn't say it any better.
@_date: 2013-08-16 16:03:54
FYI I got this example from: 
"Let me explain this in a simple way since you do not get it. Let's say you have a car you want to sell. Person A comes to you offers to buy your car for $10.000 cash. Person B comes to you and said that he wants to buy your car for $12.000 but does not have it "available at the moment". Person B promises that he will pay you the $12.000 in 2 months. You wonder what kind of person B is and call all your friends. Many of your friends know person B and tell you that B is in debt to them and that he is months behind on his payments. Now: Who would you sell your car to? The person offering to pay you cash now or the person who says he does not have cash "available" but promises to pay "later"? I wouldn't even consider B's "offer" if this was my car.
Would the "average" price of my car be $11.000 (10k+12k / 2) or just the $10.000 I can actually get for it?"

No.  BitInstant said they would process the fiat to BTC in under two hours.  They failed to do that.

I apologize that in between our full time jobs and developing this **free** app, we were unable to develop an Android version simultaneously.  One is in the works though!
@_date: 2013-05-11 04:34:54
We believe that we should keep our app free to promote knowledge and information in the Bitcoin marketplace.  Yes, it will be free.  And it will stay free even after the updates that are coming.  
@_date: 2013-05-11 04:21:55
We are currently in development on an Android app, unfortunately it does take some time to port over from iOS so be expecting one in 1-2 months.  
@_date: 2013-08-19 21:21:56
Granted, it is tricky to discover the price.  However, there is only one exchange where you can't get USD out, which technically doesn't qualify it as an exchange anymore.  The true exchanges are the ones you can transact out of.  
@_date: 2013-08-19 11:37:25
There are many customers who do have a Japanese bank account.

Coinsetter is not an exchange, its a trading platform.  And no, they won't be serving fiat or US markets.

Great job!  I also agree that you shouldn't include Mt.Gox in the calculations.  The price of Bitcoin should be what you can sell it for and immediately get fiat.

First of all, people need to understand the difference between an exchange and a trading platform.  Once you understand that, there are only a few trading platforms out there.  
The only one that has come out of beta is RTBTC.  Its through your browser, and provides the best charts and overlays.

It is the screen located below the market price screen.  Simply tap and hold on the arrows and draw up or down to set price notification "gates" above or below the price.  Push Notifications are on when the "Push Notifications" is bolded and has a small white trim around the box.

Yes.  Since you cannot actualize profits by withdrawing your funds via USD wire.  Essentially you own Goxbucks, until you can realize those into actual dollars, your Goxbucks are worth 85% of a US dollar.

If the Bitcoin community ever wants to be taken seriously in the world, then they will have to work towards that image.  Whether you like it or not, appearances matter.  Tradehill's CEO Jered Kenna dresses in a suit for interviews but that doesn't make him part of "those who crashed the world economy to the ground." It just looks professional and aesthetic.   
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:15:04
Bartering has a blurred price point, BTC to fiat is an exact price.  And actually the only price point mechanism that matters is the price point of BTC to fiat, since all bartering occurs with that price point as a reference.  Last time I checked, all items in online stores that accept Bitcoin use BTC or fiat as a reference, not a barter system.  Arguing that the BTC to fiat price isn't the primary calculation of value is absurd.
