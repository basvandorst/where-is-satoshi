I withdrew $1M+ USDT in 2017 from Bitfinex.  Took over a month to process, but I did receive it in my Bank account.  That was two years ago though, don't know if things have changed.

The market is screaming for a solution.  Bitchute and Gab are perceived threats to social media monopolies or else they would have just ignored them.  We need decentralized social media with Bitcoin/Blockchain tech as the foundation.

I understand your point.  I thought Bitcoin would be a hedge/contrarian trade to a falling stock market and real estate market too. 
I think it will be over time.  Just gotta shake out all the weak hands from the previous bubble

I don't know. Have no idea about his decision making process. The point is with the price dropping on the day of the BCH fork, hard to believe it is just a coincidence. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:53:31
Interesting.  2014 Bear was more severe considering the Mt. Gox situation.  I expect this bear to be shorter.  Rally will start picking up late summer/fall 2019 in anticipation of the halving in spring of 2020

Gotta be from the BCH mess
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:57:44
Jihan is taking hashing power away from BTC to support BCH and the whole mess is invoking fear in the market.  When the market sniffs fear we take a downturn.

STFU Tom Lee.  He's rolled out on CNBC to play the bullish BTC price guy. Everything this wall street hoe has said has been wrong.  Him and all his wall street friends are probably still shorting.  Once we hit 3k or so he'll start saying the sky is falling and change to a long position.

That said, not out of the realm we see a last gasp capitulation to $3500 or so
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:28:24
Yes, this article is correct imo.  We won't see real capitulation until heavy volume breaks below $3k
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:30:28
Will people please stop posting like the Chinese Government is going to accept Bitcoin.  It's not going to happen. Bitcoin is not compatible with the goals of the Chinese Government. Just stop with the nonsense.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:59:42
I've said this since last spring, once it was clear the bubble had popped.  We need complete capitulation.  We'll see $3500-$4500 before complete capitulation and the market can move up again
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:59:15
Who cares? All central bank currencies, for all intents and purposes, are already digital currencies.  Putting it on the blockchain wouldn't matter. The appeal of Bitcoin is that it isn't controlled by a central bank or national government.  But as Chinese I know that is hard to understand. You can't think of any solution that doesn't involve big daddy government.
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:13:27
LOL. I love these comments. Proves the end is near.  A little more pain and we'll be there soon.
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:43:05
Tom Lee is doing exactly what he's told to do by his wall street masters.  The guy's a fucking tool.   
@_date: 2018-07-29 02:15:42
Wow, this is cool. Need more indexes with Lightning services listed.  
@_date: 2018-07-29 02:17:29
So explain to us how it will fail. What are it's shortcomings? Don't just say lightning will fail and not give reasons.
@_date: 2018-07-29 02:16:26
What, Erik is a nice guy :trollface:
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:08:41
Yes, lightning could be a solution to centralized exchange woes.  Looks promising.
@_date: 2019-05-09 07:20:28
Maybe I am wrong.  But this seems a strange coincidence and strange timing.  Something stinks. But hey, who cares? We're over 6k now right? Funds are safu :rolls eyes:
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:43:58
Exactly my point.  I'm not talking about BTC. BTC is fine. But let's not pretend that the fake dollars BTC is trading against at the biggest exchanges are real dollars that are convertible and spendable.
@_date: 2019-05-08 09:02:50
IMO, Occams Razor: the fact that a rollback was even entertained by CZ, Bitcoin Devs and Miners for a 7000BTC hack can only mean the hack was much worse than CZ is letting on.  
Regardless, the guy did more damage with his attempt to get a rollback on BTC than the actual hack. Shady AF.    
Oh, and btw, no customers can withdraw for at least a week, but I'm sure Binance insiders can ;)
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:24:17
And binance magically is expecting to open deposits/withdrawals almost exactly one week as they said. Give me a break, as being a part of a development process, I understand how fluid these matters can be.  This reeks bigly
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:05:23
for real dollars, I'm sure ;)
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:08:14
Exactly.  Binance users, the largest exchange,  won't be able to sell their bitcoin for real money.  Also, kinda funny how this huge rally happened right after the hack. Nice smokesreen ;)
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:08:44
Nope. Deposits and Withdrawals.
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:35:28
ummm...lol. Can you withdraw bitcoin there right now?  Yeah, that's what I thought. Rethink what you just wrote and how obviously wrong you are.  
And the meme isn't about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Bitcoin and as solid as ever. It's about Binance!

\`\`\`Mirrors on the ceiling  
The pink champagne on ice  
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device  
And in the master's chambers  
They gathered for the feast  
They stab it with their steely knives  
But they just can't kill the beast  
Last thing I remember, I was  
Running for the door  
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before  
'Relax' said the night man

It is when you understand how to connect dots. Bitcoin is fine.  Always has been. But Binance/Bitfinex and Tether are a cancer on this space. Yeah right, no collusion at all. They are all independent actors completely separate from one another, I forgot.

Largest Bitcoin Exchange, CEO connected to everyone in the industry. Why would he even bring that up then? Seems quite odd, no?
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:39:20
you mean tether?  lol
