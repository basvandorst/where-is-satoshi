ah, I think I see it now - you have to calculate the fee from how many bytes the transaction is. looking at  the fee is more around 0.000031BTC. 
Am I screwed?

I don't, what's he up to?

Judging by your start, I'd give up

This is why I think it's easier to just buy gold direct with your bitcoin if you want to cash out. That way you don't have to involve your bank at all and the financial gains are invisible to everyone. Easier to exchange gold for fiat if and when you need to.

Easiest way is to make a paper wallet and transfer your coins there. Then just keep your private key locked away.

If you use an auth app that isn't Google Auth like authenticator plus for example, you can have all your 2fa codes backed up to dropbox. Really handy if like me you have 10 or more 2da codes and lose your phone.

I always thought this kind of post were sarcastic. Do people really sell when the price dips a bit?

I use titanium backup on my android phone to backup all my apps (including google authenticator) to dropbox. If I lose my phone, I can restore the app to another and all my codes work. I've tested this multiple times.
