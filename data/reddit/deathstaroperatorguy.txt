Cash app is showing about $120 spread. Is that typical or is it a bit high?

There’s an awesome book by a guy named David Bach called “Automatic Millionare”. It’s a very easy read, but the most important thing I got out of this book is how I spend my money. IT. CHANGED. THE. WAY. I. BUY. THINGS!
Like I said, it’s really an easy read (a sixth grader could understand in), and it will get you to look at money differently. I feel its a great addition to the comments in this thread. Oh, and it’s like $4 on Amazon.

You don’t. You hold it and watch it turn into $100.

Best advice I can give:
1.) Double check and triple check all your resources. Don’t commit to a wallet, an app, a website, an exchange until you do your research. 
2.)People are out to take your money. Always remember this:
“If it’s to good to be true, it probably is.” -STAY AWAY!
3.) Don’t take any advice from a PM or DM. People are gonna scam you.
4.)Always always always for the love of all that is good and pure, please please please Hodl.
5.) ignore steps 1-4 unless you’ve double checked it all!

I think it’s foolish to dismiss the original posters thoughts. We live in the same country that said it was illegal to hold gold at one point..

I said Amazon was dumb when it was first founded.
I said the iPad was dumb when it was first created.
I said Netflix was dumb when it sent dvds.
I said bitcoin is dumb. That will never work.
Today, I watched a movie on Netflix with a guy using an iPad and thought it was pretty cool. I went to Amazon and bought one using the bitcoin I saved.

This is the summary of every YouTuber:
YouTubers: we could see a breakout very very soon with high gains. 
Also YouTubers: it’s possible we could reach that lower support level of $8500.
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:34:01
Also YouTubers: bitcoin COULD POSSIBLY hit $11k this week.
Bitcoin: goes to $11k
YouTubers: I told you it was going to $11k! I’ve been saying it all week!!
