Hi, I'm not exactly a visitor, but I want to find a better wallet. I was using Blockchain.info but its really buggy lately. I don't have very much saved, so that's why I want to find a good web wallet where I don't have to worry about losing a backup or something. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:26:56
It's mostly the app that bugs me, but they also have outages and I read about some big bugs here. Is it GreenAddress.it?
@_date: 2014-10-07 20:00:05
Who cares, they give me free checking so I'm cool with it! /s

So much stupid in this comment.

@_date: 2014-11-04 10:02:15
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-10-16 09:54:24
That's the stupidest thing I've ever read. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:28:01
yea why not try it out on another system. If you want to switch to multi-sig wallets after testing, you need to send your balance to the new wallet. it won't just upgrade your old wallet to multisig automatically. try it with .005 BTC.

I had to google [Trezor]( Is it like 2FA for Electrum?
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:13:08
US companies definitely do this. Not sure about foreign exchanges.

Many of them didn't even miss out. They mined a lot of coins but dumped them as soon as possible for 'real money'. Even today their own hubris prevents them from recognizing what a poor decision that was.
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:38:17
Just wait until that coin validation shit kicks into high gear. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:13:43


Cultists? Like Westboro Baptist Church? No.


Some people earned a few million because they took a risk back in the early days. Just like investors in Google. A few million is NOT "immensely wealthy" either. 
Everyone else is NOT worse off. Some people overinvested and lost money. Addicted to trading, gambling, and drugs? What? I don't do any of those. I drink, but I've always drank, and Bitcoin doesn't make me an alcoholic.


Both companies have spoken against the New York regulations, and they have both provided value to Bitcoin by gaining hundreds of merchants and developing open source software. minedAblock is full of shit.
@_date: 2014-10-22 13:10:59
what did they say? they told me there's no plans to do that right now.
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:48:26


This guy is full of shit. He's making this up as he goes. He wrote this in another comment.


I'd like to see him prove he has 28 coins.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:57:07
If it goes to $0 like you keep saying it's going to, then that would be pretty stupid now wouldn't it?
@_date: 2014-10-02 13:39:24
About [2 days 19 hours]( since that comment. He just rounded generously.
The price is currently $377.
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:12:37
I noticed they automatically email you the details of each transaction in plain text, including exactly how much you spent and the address you sent the bitcoin to. They offer zero privacy protection.
@_date: 2014-09-27 14:13:13
Why are you bringing up pyramid schemes? There was only one pyramid scheme using bitcoin and that guy is going to prison. Who is claiming money is just around the bend? There is speculation, but it takes more than that to make a 'cult'. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 09:02:44
It's pretty goddamn irresponsible to encourage someone who's depressed to start gambling on your website, don't you agree?
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:43:22
Prove how many you have so we know you're not full of shit. You say you have 28. Sign a message from your largest address.

I've bought a lot of things with BTC, but never drugs.
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:14:55
Why go through all that work when you can just write a few bogus checks? Ahh, those were the days, huh? You could literally double spend 10 times per day for several days if you wanted to.
@_date: 2014-09-19 09:03:44
You expect it to level out at $20 but suggest buying at $40. That's a special kind of stupid.
@_date: 2014-09-12 12:10:31
You'll never succeed if you don't even try.
@_date: 2014-10-22 13:10:27
That didn't convince me to reconsider at all.
@_date: 2014-11-28 10:42:40
Seems fairly typical unfortunately. I shopped around there a few months ago and couldn't find anything so appealing that it was worth paying a premium for with bitcoin. I got what I wanted elsewhere, cheaper. :/ 
Here's hoping they get a nice bump today.
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:48:36
Fucking on camera.

From what I've seen, Coindesk is total garbage. The 'articles' they published during the China panic a few weeks ago were bordering on complete fabrications.

If your answer is no: Don't fix it. :)

Not a troll here, but what you say about people who choose not to have kids is a bunch of bullshit.

Buttcoiner trying to trigger capitulation to try and scare people away as if everyone in is suicidal. Weak troll.

You're putting way to much effort into such a feeble troll.

Joe Rogan isn't exactly a bitcoin advocate. People get downvoted in all subreddits.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:48:42
is a cult because somebody downvoted somebody.
is a circlejerk because somebody upvoted somebody.
@_date: 2015-01-21 08:20:08
The irritating thing is that they haven't made any improvements to their website or their app. You still can't export transactions, and they are hiding the buy/sell price even more than they did when they first launched.
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:38:19


In this context, 'loose' is correct. English is tricky like that. Some people even try to confuse you intentionally. ;)
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:15:00
You read it? Even this part?


And this part:


Since they're not going to grant us privacy, we must take it for ourselves.
I disagree that Bitcoin in its current form fulfills the motive expressed in the previous quotes. Bitcoin's current privacy model is very poor and must be improved to strengthen fungibility. Lucky for you, Confidential Transactions won't be required any time soon. Even if it were implemented this year (it won't be), you would still have the option to send traditional transactions if you don't care about privacy. Some will argue that even CT is not enough because users might still be identified through metadata.

That looks cool. So I just bookmark it? What happens if I change my browser or delete the bookmark? Can somebody steal my bookmark easy? And is it just 1 address? I thought you need more than that.

The entire market may be worth 12 billion but the exchange market is shallow. Traders can't trade large amounts without moving the market around because the liquidity just isn't there.

The mods are doing a bad job if keeping XT stuff out. I don't care about other forums, they are a waste. I only lurk now because of downvotes but I will find something else to read w/o all the XT spam.
@_date: 2015-09-04 12:42:36
you downvoted me for pointed out that this sub has a bad downvoting problem? you are the problem i'm talking about. I don't think that stuff is being censored. but the spam is out of control.

If the trader didn't have enough to cover the market order, then the market order would have been rejected.
