I've only been selling at a gain. Then buying in low and repeating, so, yes I've been selling but not as a sucker.

Yeah. Snyder still riding off success of 300, which was a pretty direct rip on style from the graphic novel. He keeps whiffing and people keep throwing money at him. Really wished this movie (based on an incredible graphic novel) was something actually tolerable.

YES! Right on the money, wish I had gold to tip you.

I wonder how that kid who streams and bought bitcoin at around 17k is reacting right now. Wish I had a link to his stream to catch the VOD.

Just a query here: the linen in my wallet contributes what meaningful? How about the servers of banks running around the clock 'maintaining' my bank account ledger? 
Not saying this proves BTC, simply that there has never been a currency (since maybe straight barter) which actually contributed something meaningful in transaction. 
Economy, itself, was the meaningful contribution -- the move away from barter. The mode and methodology in which it occurs is irrelevant, at the core.
TLDR: Nothing is meaningful or useful. See Socrates.

That wasn't the question, but I should have clarified. I simply was considering investment in BitCoin and saw two ways to do so. It's not the BitCoin itself which interested me, but it's potential value. And so I was asking for thoughts on acquiring that value through the two avenues I saw available to me.
