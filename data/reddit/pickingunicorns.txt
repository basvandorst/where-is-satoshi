Did you see Doge? I can not take this list serious..

I am really enthousiastic about the stellar protocol. Bitcoin could be traded instantly on it. Would be real progress ! See more about how it might work here

People have to take out new loans in order for that money to get into the economy and create inflation. At some point people will not take out new loans.

Bitcoin should be An asset on the stellar network! Solves it all !

Strong support around 6k. Waiting to see what happens next:). 
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:56:36
I intentionally did.. The breakout could have been caused by a big bitcoin usdt owner who wanted to enter bitcoin. It's hard to know if this started with an increase due to faith in btc or distrust in tether. Whatever the case, value is flowing into bitcoin for now, thats good.
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:44:37
If true, fair point. Where did you check these movements?

Can you force people to accept usd abroad..?

I don't think it will be pretty..

Actually it is their money weird enough. Deposits are loans to your bank ^^.

Really worrisome that this message gets so many likes. Would Americans really want to reign the world like that? 
@_date: 2018-10-04 20:34:22
Alright, I hope so. I truly am afraid somtimes of what Americans decide to do when the dollar would starts collapsing. Hope crypto crypto and not weapons will be the go to solution.

I don't think this increase is necessarily caused by fud around USDT. Couldn't it be like this:
Bitcoin was has been on the verge of a breakout from the descending triangle pattern that has formed since the start of 2018. The past month traders have been watching the price closely to see if the breakout would be up or down. As the price started breaking out today, a lot of traders wanted to enter BTC again. Since most traders use USDT as a stable store of value when they are not invested, USDT got sold in exchange for BTC. Because more traders use USDT, the price of bitcoin against usdt went up faster. As people saw USDT tank in value because of traders buying BTC,  some people got scared and also converted their USDT to BTC, which increased this dynamic.
What do you guys think?
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:57:08
I meant that i get the feeling that more Americans actually agree with such an idea.

Stellar is quite compatible to Bitcoin, if you go to wallet, settings, manage trustlines, you can accept BTC on keybase. If you do this I can send you some sats if you like. It's even possible to do cross-asset payments, where I send USD, but you receive BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-16 09:25:32
You can convert the XLM to BTC within Keybase as well. If you download keybase, go to wallet, settings, manage trustlines, you can accept BTC. I can then send you some sats if you like.
@_date: 2019-09-16 09:48:53
I am not sure about that. By tokenizing stocks you will be able to pay with stocks, while the other party receives BTC, USD or another stock. There are many forms of value you'd want to interoperate with that are not "money". As long as a big portion of the world pays in fiat, I think we need a way to interoperate with that. It's much easier to onboard people if they can accept whatever value they want, while you can pay with BTC.
The thing is that if you want to interoperate with fiat, you need deterministic finality (a moment in time on which a payment is 100% final). In btc you have probabilistic finality, which is really good for BTC's usecase. But when you want to interoperate with Fiat, you need to give Financial Institutions a way to create a token that can be transacted with 100% finality. If not, law might determine that if a foreign company that has made a payment goes bankrupt, the payments has to return to sender if it is not deterministically final. 
I think that by connecting a protocol like Stellar and BTC, the ecosystem get's much stronger.
@_date: 2019-09-16 12:18:42
No reason to be so aggressive? You can send btc on Keybase for a fee of 0.00001 cents. I can send you 3$ worth of btc to buy you a coffee if you like!
@_date: 2019-09-16 09:38:34
I don't think Stellar is competing with Bitcoin. It creates a way to create cross-asset payments, while at the same time linking cryptocurrency to fiat. So that you can pay someone with BTC, while he receives fiat. This would mean that a shop or person doesn't have to accept BTC, for you to pay them with it.
Stable coins issued by financial institutions are now instantly convertible to BTC, LTC, XLM or even real estate backed stable coins.
The XLM token is just 1 part of the protocol, if you don't like it you can mostly disregard it. It was needed to have a spam protection mechanism. The most important aspect imo is that the protocol creates a way to have interoperable payments. This can really benefit BTC as well.
I can send you some sats, while I pay with USD if you like. Just sent me a message on Keybase if you're up for it.

Pity that people that support free choice of currency (bitcoin), now don't support that free choice inside the subecosystem of money that bitcoin is part of (cryptocurrencies).
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:43:52
I think the discussion on what money is hasn't settled yet. I think there is a point in saying that when bitcoin is used to define prices (a bread = 5 Satoshi) it's more a currency than it is now. But all depends on your definition of money.
Next to that I think it will help all of us to not be hostile to people having a different opinion. I think adoption goes faster if we are open and welcoming.
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:21:31
I think I agree. But to consider I should know your definition of money. What is it? Maybe the guy on LinkedIn had a different one?
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:01:47
I don't get why someone should be publicly shamed for having an opinion. No its not an opinion we like, but at least it opens a discussion. 
@_date: 2019-09-16 09:23:02
Did you know you can actually send XLM, while the other party receives BTC on Keybase? 
This is me sending USD, while my friend receives BTC. You can accept BTC under wallet, settings, manage trustlines.

Pretty neat!
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:39:39
Yep. Onchain btc transaction  or LN is ultimate. For me it's okay to use a btc iou to be able to pay btc, while someone else receives usd. For higher value tx I would use btc main chain. Low btc to btc tx I would use LN. 
Depends on what you want to do I guess. Have a good one.
@_date: 2019-09-16 10:37:04
They actually do. There is a paper of the bank of international settlement about the issue. There is also this one from the ecb: 
Don't you think we will keep seeing stocks, funds, real estate or other forms of value? By tokenizing these, you can make them liquid and use them for payments. Even fiat is unlikely to completely disappear soon imo (how much I'd like it to).
Stellar is a bit like smtp indeed, which allows to connect all these disperate payment forms (or value if you will). Lightning is awesome for sending btc to someone who wants btc. But how do you buy or sell btc? You still need to interact with other value forms. This process is really shitty until now. 
I can now instantly send usd, which you receive as btc. That really helps the btc ecosystem and adoption speed imo.
@_date: 2019-09-16 11:06:17
Yes. So with Bitcoin consensus, every block that is added gives you a higher probability that your payment will not be reversed, the chance is, however, never 0. Also there is no real 1 point in time when the payment is finalized since it is probabilistic finality. In international payments law that is a problem, you need to have that 1 moment in time on which you can say "ownership has transferred from A to B at this exact time". Yes, that is a declaration on finality, but it can not be disregarded in an international payment or transfer of ownership.
Cool on the other forms of value. I think it's awesome if it would be possible to pay your coffee with your apple stock, while the cashier receives BTC (or USD/whatever).
Tokenizing redeemable assets on Bitcoin means you will have entities issuing these redeemable tokens. There are a few hurdles for that to work on Bitcoin:
\- A redeemable asset could be more valuable than BTC. Imagine when a good amount of USD would be tokenized on top of BTC, the marketcap might be much bigger. The BTC consensus has incentives that are linked to the value of BTC. It could become very profitable to do a 51 attack on BTC, if you would be able to double spend the USD on top of it. This should be fixed in such an implementation. Stellar does that with flexible trust, where nodes can choose who they trust for consensus, instead of letting every CPU participate in consensus (even when bad).
\- Finality, as explained, would be problematic. If you issue a redeemable token, you only want to redeem that token if you are sure that you are not redeeming the same token twice. With bitcoin consensus that's a bit harder. Also, if you want to do cross-asset transfer, you would need to wait for multiple blocks to have passed.
I think it's much more efficient to combine these two protocols for that. Let Bitcoin do what it's good at and add the Stellar protocol to it to have interoperable payments. We'll see how it plays out. Until tokenized assets are living on bitcoin this combination is helping bitcoin adoption imo.
I'm really excited about the combination for now, so many cool things are now possible!

Cool! Great talk by the way, thanks!

So what is the definition of money ? 
@_date: 2019-09-16 09:58:15
By the way, send me a message through keybase, I'll send you some sats, will be fun :-).
