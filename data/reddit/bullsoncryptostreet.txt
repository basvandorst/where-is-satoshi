Hey man. Sorry to hear from your bad experience with Coinbase. I too have heard of other's who have got robbed (especially Canadians) as they refrained from CAD withdrawals completely meaning your money is locked in with Coinbase/GDAX exchange, if any of you are in this boat, transfer your coins into a different cold storage wallet or transfer to another exchange like BITTREX. As other's mentioned, it's always safer to keep as little money in an exchange at a time, and keep your bank roll and profits in a cold wallet storage. This enables you to transfer your coins to any other exchange which accommodates what you are looking to get from them (whether its USD/CAD withdrawals, margin trading, stop losses, etc.) 
For Canadians, I recommend using Quadrigacx and Bittfinex, while for Americans I suggest using BITTREX. I have heard of some others not getting orders filled with Kraken which also doesn't have the best customer service and longer wait times for wiring money in and out. 
If you do decide to rejoin the crypto space let me know as our company (bulls on crypto street) helps alot of new investors / people coming from the stock market world get setup properly with Bitcoin investments. We have hours of free content on Youtube and on our website. If you are interested let me know as I want to pay it forward in providing value to all you guys before having your money disappear!
All the best with your future investments.
