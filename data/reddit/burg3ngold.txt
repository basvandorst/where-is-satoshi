To be honest I have never had a single problem with coinbase and I think they offer exactly what this community needs. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:28:48
I'm assuming it would just be a simple query run daily?

No respectable exchange is going to let you buy bitcoins with paypal.

So currently I use Coinbase and for the sake of the argument lets say I have .5 BTC.   I create a paper wallet.  I transfer .5 BTC from coinbase address too the public address of the paper wallet.  The paper wallet now has .5 BTC.  
How do I spend that BTC?  Let's say that I want to buy something on overstock.com?  I know I don't put the private key anywhere; however, what do I need to do to spend BTC.  I think thats a major part I am not understanding.  Do i need to download a wallet?? Use my phone?? Does anyone have a youtube or something of this process. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 23:02:49

Three Rules to live by:
 Always use 2FA
 Always use different long,alpha-numeric,unintelligble passwords on every different account
 Don't store anything over what you are able to risk losing in an exchange 
@_date: 2014-08-15 03:31:34
Look guys.. Not saying I would do this.. But hypothetically 30 years from now if Bitcoin was 10K usd per coin people are going to start trolling these forums looking for people like you... A word to the wise, don't ever post how much Btc you have... Would you ever walk down a sketchy alleyway yelling that you have 500 bucks in your pocket? 
@_date: 2014-07-28 00:06:15
Those damn bitcoiners! Why would the be hanging out at Burn them on the stake!!   
In true blue troll fashion I'm sure as you read my first sentence you already clicked on my username to find something to make fun of me about.. I'm actually contemplating tipping you bitcoin and see what you do with it LOL!
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:07:47
 No Problem!  I still have a question regarding 1 &amp; 2 tho,  I understand that you click on either of the labels to type in what I am searching for.  Let me put the steps to reproduce:
1. Launch the application
2. Click on Calculators
3. Click on BTC label (so it turns light green)
4. Click the '.' button
5. Click the 0 button
6. Click the 1 button 
^ The above should display .01
Actual - In the field 1 is displayed
Expected - In the field .01 is displayed
This is the same behavior for clicking on USD too. 
Thanks for the info for item number 5, that makes sense.  I just guess personally I look at /new so I can make sure I get the latest news, even if that means I have to go through garbage.

What does this even mean?
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:45:26
No Problem :) Here to help!
@_date: 2014-08-15 03:38:22
I would of noticed because the email of your coinbase message had the wrong subject.
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:12:23
This makes a lot of sense to do this.  Instead of limiting to amount of Btc they are limiting by USD
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:57:23
Thanks! -- Here is my free QA for you app.
1.  Calculators -  You cannot see how much .01 BTC is worth in USD.  Attempt to calculate any value less that .1 BTC and you are unable to enter that value in.  For example try to put in .01 BTC 
2. Calculators -  You cannot see how much .09 USD is worth in BTC.  Pretty much the same problem as issue   The same fix should be able to be used
3. When trying to set my limits you should make the slider go by blocks of 5.  For example I'm trying to set a limit for 700 and it so hard to stop right on that value.  I ended up settling for 702 :)
4.  Limits notification don't seem to work.  When I set limits up, close out of the app, go back to the app and my settings are not saved.  Maybe a problem with APNS and UDID for device? 
5.  Unure if updating news section is working for reddit.  I notice on reddit.comthere are the following new posts since I first downloaded the app *"Is Ben Lawsky mentally ill?", 
 "When everything is liquid and everyone is a shareholder", 
 "Genesis1 - Bitswana ATM Project - We need your help.", 
 "We need to make a promotional video for Bitcoin like this. With focus on history of money/trade/exchange.", 
 "New BitXBay promo video.....pretty funny :)", 
 "Regulating software is a violation of protected First Amendment rights".*  
It seems like the news section isn't updating since the initial load.  The latest article I see within the app from reddit is "Bitcoin ATM in Chicago Finally"
6. News Options - Go to options and unselect everything except reddit.  Close out of the app.  Open the app and go to News.  I see articles from unselected items such as BITCOINIST, BITCOIN MAGAZINE, ETC even tho the Options have those items unselected
I run an iPhone 5 on 7.1.2 
If you want me to QA any of your work or know someone that would like my help always reach out :).  
Also -- You should think about iframing the blockchain.info site too.  That would be really helpful for people to search addresses!

Thanks for the info!  
The only reasons I was contemplating using a chromebook was because of the OOTB Google OS and the price point.  I have never booted anything besides windows so getting a linux distribution and going through the process seems daunting to me.  I'll definitely check out the Vault situation for the meantime. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:26:32
I have a blockchain wallet with two addresses.. one address has .5 btc and the other has 0 btc.  If i send .3 BTC to some random address owned by someone else somewhere where does my .2 BTC reside?   Does a new change address become created?? where do I go to find it? 
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:22:22
Exactly what I did and it cleared everything up!

Source of info ?
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:59:31
Sorry to be brutally honest, but the design ALONE will make it so no one signs up.  Add the fact that you are going to try and get people to understand pool mining of bitcoin/altocin?  Then even if they do understand that.. why would they accept?  So you can make money off their electricity bill? 
To sum it up... you should quit before you sink more money into this than its worth. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 00:41:22

Please explain?  I have heard this concept of change addresses before but don't really understand.  My current understanding is that if I have a paper wallet with 3 BTC and I send 1 BTC over to another address, my paper wallet has 0 BTC in it and a change address is created that holds 2 BTC.  How do I get access to the change address?  Where is that private key?

I think micropayments would be extremely useful for apps.   For some reason I cant get over paying a dollar for app; however, I can go to the bar and spend 7 bucks on a drink.   If an app charged micropayments for views, or to do something I would be more okay with it.

Most people restrict iOS 6 because support of iOS 6 really opens the gambit on many older iOS devices.  If you only make it available for iOS 7 then you don't have to worry about legacy devices.

I had an eight ounce kobe beef steak at and upscale restaurant and it ran around 350 bucks.  That was probably the most expensive restaurant I have ever been too and the price for 6 of us was around 2500 with tip.. I don't think you could ever get an eating experience that has a 7 million dollar price tag.

Could they be missing the intermediate cert?

2. The certificate should be trusted by all major web browsers (all the correct intermediate certificates are installed).
3. The certificate was issued by DigiCert.	
4. The certificate will expire in 751 days.
