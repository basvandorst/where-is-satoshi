You don't know nothing!!!!

Well the former owner that scam everyone was part of this current team till last year. So the problem here is way more complex then you think. 
You can make business with scammers , and thief , from every corner of the world but it does not make them trustworthy just because you made business with them. 
sooner or latter the Mercado Bitcoin and Leandro Marciano will have to pay for what they did.
SO DONT USE MERCADO BITCOIN 
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:43:45
Well 
Leandro did everything under mercado bitcoin company . People were depositing money on Bitcoin Rain and he, leandro, divert the BTC to mercado Bitcoin which it would  become  a sale order. 
Some users would buy theses BTC again invest in the BitcoinRain, and he, leandro would do the same thing again and again.
And thanks to blockchain we know all this
So it was a scam which full lots of users.  
Mercado Bitcoin says he paid all the people. But the true fact is, the company was use to scam all the user just as much as BitcoinRain did. And they did not pay all the people.
But they will have to answer that to the justice soon . It will be Just a matter of time.
