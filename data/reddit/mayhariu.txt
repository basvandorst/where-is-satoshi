It's up to anyone, at their own will, to donate for something I spent the time making. I didn't in any way beg for donations, it's only an option. You are making a huge deal over nothing. The wallet is still 100% free and never stated it was anything but that.

Thank you, Sir. (:

The wallet is free of course. Aside from the Dorian portrait, which was free to use, I have put in the effort of everything else. Therefore, it can be considered my own work to an extent and donations are optional for that effort. (:

I didn't beg for donations at all actually...

I'm a chick haha but thank you for the support! I'm not of course claiming I made/took and image and selling it for profits. It's just, "Hey guys, I made this because I thought it would be a pretty cool wallet..." if anyone wants to donate then I appreciate it and I'd like to make more cool wallets for you guys!

I just bought some because of this. I was freaking out because I went to the hairdresser today. I told her "ONLY ONE INCH!" And she said she understood. SHE CUT 6 INCHES OF MY LONG HAIR ): I hate how it looks now so incredibly short. This will be my savior

Actually, I'm a natural blonde and just bought some due to my idiotic hair dresser cutting way more than I asked. And I wanted to use Bitcoin until I found out my 0.700BTC is only worth $23CAD now.

I suppose it could have been worded better as, "Dorian Themed Paper Wallet". I worked on it for a while, it was late and I was tired haha.
