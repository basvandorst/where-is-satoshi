Cool, I hadn't caught the reference. 
That's the thing about Reddit. There's always an inside joke. Sometimes I catch on &amp; sometimes I don't...

Maybe this post should be a sticky for a while so more people have a chance to see it.

Is there a Fappycoin yet? 
I call dibs on Fappycoin.

The mining doesn't use a computer. 
It can be done by hand.

Just looking for a simple answer. Course, if my theory is true, it's odd that you didn't get spammed on the original.

I had mine set for $500. It went off the night Gox finally fell apart. I watched it dip lower and came to Reddit to discover why. I figured it would go even lower and got too greedy. I set my alarm for $350 and went to bed. Biggest mistake I've made in a while...
I'm just waiting till the next panic sell off to buy more.
Alarm set at $500 again.

Specific, like trying to make money (fiat) out of nothing? 
Hey, have you tried those Flappy Bird knock offs? The zoo of alt-coins we're seeing is pretty much the same. 1 success and thousands of copycats.
