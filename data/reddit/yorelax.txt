I looked into this $57 per transaction because that's absurd, blockchain.info's chart has some serious miscalculations going on if they're getting $50+ dollars per transaction. If you pay $50+ for a transaction you're overpaying by 10x even for the fastest confirmation. 
Their mempool information on fee rates per byte show even for priority transactions (ie next block &lt;10 min) you should use a fee rate of 249 sat/byte, given the median transaction size of around 226 bytes this calculates to around 56,274 satoshis (.00056274 BTC). At the current exchange rate ~$7,300 that is around $4.16.
While I believe $4.16 is way too much still, saying an average transaction is $57 is absurd and untrue. 
EDIT:  is a good website for estimating fees based on how quickly you want your transaction to clear

Came here to say this, definitely gotten a cup there after visiting the zoo.

Yes, that is correct.
Note: some common 'coins' (Golem, OMG, etc) are actually tokens that are part of the ethereum blockchain. You can learn more about tokens [here](

So think of it this way:
Before the split the blockchain says your address has a certain quantity of bitcoin. 
Prefork address: 10 BTC
Once the chain splits you now have two independent blockchains that both carry over the quantity you had before the fork. (Although they may go by different names now (e.g., BTC and BCH))
Fork 1: 10 BTC
Fork 2: 10 BCH
