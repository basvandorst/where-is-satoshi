Bet you won't be saying that when we jump 5% in an hour. Quit bitching
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:14:11
Aaaah so the amount exceeding the 12.5 bitcoin is just the tx fees. I somehow missed that obvious point.
So the miner goes and looks at the difference between inputs and outputs in every tx snd then adds that to the reward.
If you really look at it closely when you make a transaction you "burn" the miner fee and the miner then creates that burned fee again out o nowhere in the coinbase transaction right?

You CAN'T bind an extrinsic object to a blockchain in a decentral trustless way. Blockchains only work for their intended use-case when the object is intrinsic to the system.
Someone has to upgrade the information of the product to the IBM blockchain-single point of failure and trusted third party. IBM could just as well use e central data base but that's basicsally what this will amount to anyway as i don't hear about mining and validating their chain. Riding the hype train nothing else. Sad.

Oooh thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:27:04
Great, thanks for clearing that up for me!
@_date: 2018-10-04 21:13:34
Nice job but you coulr have validated the chain on a powerful machine and then copied the data over to save a lot of time :)

Well you should't take reddit as the indicator for the Bitcoin community. Most people lack any kind of knowledge here. If you want to actually follow interesting news, have great discussions and hear what great minds have to say you should hop over to crypto twitter.
Reddit's only for the shits and giggles. I could definitely pick out a few things you said and argue against them but after all who cares what we two argue here. I don't have the will to argue via keyboard anymore.
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:41:22
Half of the time i see something here on reddit which i totally agree with I look at the name and it's YOU xD

Decentralized, best devs, secure, scaling solution in sight, actually works as promised, no figur head, functioning base layer, anti-fragile, overstood social and technical attacks, is actually known around the world, need any more?
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:43:37
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:31:21
Man, honestly I don't get it either. Lots of companys are building on Ethereum but nobody seems to stop an ask the question if the base layer actually functions in a secure way. New buzzword seems to be "distributed ledger technology". They'll learn eventually. But wait till the first big things blow up and people will be calling Bitcoin and "blockchain technology" a failed  technology, not realizing that Bitcoin is way more than that.
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:26:52
Well I couldn't disagree more but you made some money and good for you! 
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:47:10
Great stuff, you are the kind of person Bitcoin needs.
I would not recommend you using a brain wallet. Most bitcoins don't get lost because of hacks but because of people not remembering how to retrieve them. Brainwallet may be a good option when crossing borders but not in daily use or longtime storage. Maybe watch a video by andreas antanopoulus on securing th3 private keys.
Secondly I'd recommend you look in to running your own full node.
You may want to use this guide by Stadicus:
And at last I'd recommend you not wasting to much time on reddit because there's not much substance here.
Join crypto twitter and socialize with the people actually working on stuff.
For that purpose you can follow the people stadicus is following, he's got a good selection:

I respect the fact that you tool the time to type such a long response. I'm not gonna argue against you because I lack the economic knowledge but if you're willing to challenge your own viewpoint you could read Saifedean Ammous's new book "The Bitcoin Standard".

Yeah man and look at all the great things ahead. Mast, schnorr signatures, lightning, nimble wimble, betterhash and so on.

Oh the good old blockstream fud again. There's a lot of disinformation and half truths in those posts. Cobra who controlls bitcoin.org made positive comments about bch in the past weeks but is portrayed as some sort of blockstream related villain helping to take over Bitcoin. A lot of developers if not most don't even work for blockstream. I'm personally not concerned at all about these posts. But I do see how not so technical people or just people in general who haven't put hundred of hours in understanding Bitcoin could be spooked by these posts. Look if you want to actually read interesting stuff, see great discussions and follow great minds then go over to crypto twitter. Reddit is just a comedy/drama shitshow at this point.

Hey fellow swiss guy I was wondering the same thing.
Do you have a bit of knowledge about setting up the node?
I'm seem to be stuck because I don't seem to have any incoming connections and my screen looks quite different than the one in the guide under "verification of bitcoind operations"

Can you maybe help me out?

So we're talking about an estimated 4% from a single farm which isn't nothing but still far from one person controlling a significant part. You do realize that the more computing power you centralize, the more risk you take because of fire,earthquake and so on. I don't like Bitmain and I certainly wanna see more decentralization but I think you are making this out to be a bigger problem than it is.
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:42:58
No if you're new to Bitcoin then forget about lightning for now.

Totally agree. If you want to learn about the subject I'd recommend the Mooc from the university of  Nicosia. It's free and Andreas Antanopoulus is one of the teachers!
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:40:10
Interesting, and I have to say I am no expert on mining but wouldn't it be faster to search the mempool and create a block yourself instead of waiting for one to be sent to you? There has to be a solution for the reward and management problem. I may be missing a cruical point in block propagation and aggregation.

Why wouldn't the whole world just use BTC? Why should people want to go through exchanges or atomic swaps for every country and company? What problem does your project solve that bitcoin can't?
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:29:19
After some time my problem seemed to solve itself. 
Have you looked at the updated guide on github? The one on reddit isn't maintained anymore. 
Also i came across a post on which someone shared a whole lightning script which would make things way easier. Dunno if it's 100% safe though.
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:40:52
Damn, more expensive than a bitcoin. But nice marketing trick they got going by hopping on the crypto bandwagon. The watch really is quite an eye catcher though.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:27:13
Are you implying that you are creating the Shitcoin1780 to rip of people and then donate the money? This could indeed work! The rest can be solved by decent wallets running with good old Bitcoin ;)

What a shitshow
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:32:27
You aren't looking at the big picture. 
A pool consists of a huge amount of individual miners. Yes  not all of these miners are paying attention to what the pool managament is doing but a significant amount of them are.
Now to the key point: Miners are obligated to not cause people to loose trust in Bitcoin. If they start cheating the prize will drop and guess what miners don't want! The prize to drop. So let's say the biggest pool starts double spending. People will start fleeing out of Bitcoin and the miners will stop making profits. And believe me when people start loosing money they will react by changing to a pool which is following the consensus rules.
The system is beautifully designed and the more you study it, the more you are amazed by it.

In my estimation China is a deeply authoritarian country right? They censor everything that could remotely criticize or undermine the gouvernment. They established this rating-sytem that rates every individual on how he is beheaving. Hell they even cencored tiger from winnie the poo because he was used to meme the prime minister.
So how on earth will a shitface gouvernment like that allow cryptos which stand for everything the chinese gouvernment isn't?
They will only allow something they can controll and something which they can use to even better rate, controll and track their citizens.
Would like to hear some feedback.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:20:55
You are speeking of a lot of hypotheticals. Do you really think miners are gonna risk a multimillion dollar gamble on an attack which may or may not make another coin or fork rise?
I agree that we should find a way to more decentralization though. It would be a great thing if miners would be able to mine in a pool but make their own blocks instead of getting them from the pool organization. Is there a pool out there that does that and what would be the potential downside? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:58:42
Yeah it's expensive, you earn more money but you also pay a lot more for everything. For reference, a macdonalds plain and simple hamburger is about 2.50$
A pizza margherita is about 15-20$

Sucks right? Now what if i want to use bitcoin to timestamp a document? What if i want to use bitcoin as a platform for token issuance? 
You dumbing down bitcoin to a currency doesn't serve it justice. It's a whole new financial network with possibilitys we have not yet been able to grasp.
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:39:33
One of the fundamental functions of money is store of value and that means not spending it. Bitcoin is a great store of value.

Sorry I'm a programmer noob but have a raspberry pi node running. Where do you dump the mempool info exactly to access it on the phone? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:08:18
Lol, no problem :)
No it requires a HD. But you can take a normal cheap one with usb 3. I'm using a mobile phone charger as power supply.
A USB 3 1TB HD doesn't cost very much and if you stop operating the node you can still use it otherwise.
But for lightning to work you surely need a fully sinced and tx-ID'd blockchain copy? Haven't heard of neutrino.

Used for lightning has to be activated at this day and stage afaik. If you don't activate at the start you download it all and then have tk re-index it for several hours.
