If you mean that orange/green symbol vanish it’s just the youtube demonetaized battle over videos. Nothing to do with bitcoin

Almost in every case it is more profitable to buy and hold bitcoin rather than asic miners. Also it is much cheaper to just buy and hold. What if you asic blows up after a month?

Gold mining uses 20 times more crude oil than what bitcoin mining does. Maybe we should ban gold mining ��

I would imagine stocks would transfer from fiat pairings to crypto pairings. So people like Bill Gates would still be filthy rich as they have most of the stocks. Unless normal stocks become obsolete by some cryptosubstitute but that might be a 1:1 change.

If someone has a sell order of 0.3b and all that teather is used to buy it. The price only moves up to that sell order. Market cap is current price times circulating supply. Market cap only grows bigger if the sell price is pushed higher.

This news is already old af in Finland :D Prasos is doing everything they can to please banks but they dont want their business. So Prasos is in discussions with foreign banks�� The banks and Gov fear tax evasion but now they straight up refuse to take tax money from Prasos and force them out of Finland. There is still a nice bank that does work with then in Finland����

Not saying cryptos cannot replace normal banking but before things like these dont have solutions banking will have a place. And giving an argument does not mean I am against something. Not being able to find bad sides in everything makes you a blind fool..

One thing about banks is that they take care of your money. You lose your password? Not a problem. Also the government backs some of your money up if the bank collapses. These two factors are keeping many away from crypto. You cant really loose your money in a bank but cryptos? Just forget/miss write 2 letters in your secret key and you are fooked up..
