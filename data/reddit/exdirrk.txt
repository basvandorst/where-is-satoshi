Here is where you are wrong, assuming the evidence suggested is true.  He knew the person he was selling the coins to was laundering money, and he even knew it was illegal drug money that he was laundering.  It is no coincidence that no one else in that company was charged with the same crime.  


He made an excel spreadsheet containing about 400000K worth of transactions that he knew were from "BTC King"


Could be as simple as they caught "BTCKing" by a bank getting suspicous of a guy depositing $1000 20 times a day.  So when they looked into him they probably got the warrant and seen the emails which led back to charlie.

I know this is a joke but I was talking to my father about bitcoin a whhile back and when I explained everything to him he took back for a minute and said well they said the internet wouldn't be a big deal and here it is.  He told me a story of when he was a kid his parents got their first ever credit card and were saying how stupid it was and how useless it was.  He said he remembers people laughing at the idea of using credit cards.  He didn't invest in bitcoin but instead peercoin but his point still stands.

That is reaching at best but I guess this whole post is...
My company is listed under that customer list and we use akamai because they offer amazing support and have a global reach/capabilities that others just can't compete with.  They have been around for a long time and are one of the largest CDNs.

It makes so much more sense now.

I clicked on the comments thinking the site was a bitcoin website with a viri or trojan attached to just like you are saying.

Why is this being down voted so badly?

I think anyone who tells you they have an "answer" to this is just full of shit.  Since it seems like you are asking for just opinions I will go ahead and share mine.
I believe bit coin is going to blow up next year as the economy struggles to regain momentum. The governments will come to a choice where they need to decide to let it grow or stop it.  If they try to stop it, they will have to do it soon because my guess is by the end of next year we will start to see more companies taking bitcoin as payments or at least as donations.  If they do not try to stop it, then I can see it becoming a real competitor to visa &amp; mastercard for online transactions but not for another 2 or 3 years.

I knew it was something obvious sorry.  I was in a hurry to register to ask a question.  Thanks I will post on the newbie sections but I think you should also include it in the help section on Ur forums because sometimes people don't read or are in a hurry like myself. Thanks for the answer and sorry for my lack of reading

Dear users of the Exchange Btc-e.com
The exchange is not going to close. We will refund all losses from our reserves.
Neither the servers nor the database were compromised. There were no SQL injections.
At 04:07 MSK (GMT+4) our LR API Secret Key was compromised. It's 16 uppercase, lowercase letters and digits. They may have bruteforced it for long.
Using the key the hacker imitated LR deposits from many accounts and bought up Bitcoins, Namecoins and Litecoins.
We lost our daily volume, approx. 4500 BTC. The attacker couldn't withdraw more
as most BTC were distributed over several offline wallets.
At 10:30 we restored the database to the state it was at 04:00, right before the attack. All trades after 4:00 are reverted.
People who attempted withdrawals before 04:00 MSK will get their funds withdrawn later today.
For people who deposited BTC, LTC and NMC after 04:00 MSK the funds will be put to their balances before market opens.
We are working on the scripts for this.
If you deposited USD after 04:00 MSK you should send us your login, amount and payment system used by email or PM.
Our plan:
1. The trade will be disabled until we restore the balances to the point before market crash.
2. After that, the trade and deposit/withdrawal will be back on, approx. within 1-2 days.

It is a stretch, but they are accepting our currency unlike millions of other websites.  I would rather view good things bitcoin is doing instead of all the scams and thefts of the past 2 weeks.

I run gpg on my linux and mac computers ur preaching to the quire here.  I even wrote a tutorial for linux and mac and posted it on pastebin but I lost the link.  This website, is secure enough to save it and use it locally, I have verified the javascript and it is all local js.  I would never use these websites, I was just arguing the "complex" part.  i would say saving a page to a computer is easier than installing and using gpg for a noob.
Tutorial Here:

I have found that sometimes in Chrome if I visit Mt. Gox it will show the incorrect last price.  Especially after refreshing multiple times.

What it says is at 15:30 20K bitcoins were traded through mt gox.  Your "one transaction" is not proof that it went through mt gox unless you can claim one of the addresses is owned by mt gox in which case nvm u r right.

If it crashes I and other people are buying up ur cheap coins.  Just because people get scared does not ruin the integrity of the coin.  Bring on the $6 coins from last June please!
