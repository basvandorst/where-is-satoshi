Thank you, glad to hear it worked out.
Can you believe that I wanted to cash out yesterday @ $700b market cap?
Talk about unlucky timing ;)
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:14:18
Well, not exactly.
It was Stack Overflow, which is a _far_ more reputable source.
Regardless, he fucked up.

The original crypto scammer!

Stop talking about bcash. You just give it power.
Don't talk about it and it will die off like every other shit btc fork

Then you didn't bother to do your own research and bought based on emotion and not logic.
That'll always get you burned.
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:59:20
Good on you mate.
And I agree, there definitely were people saying that. But as OP said, there were people saying the opposite.
The answer is to always do your own research and don't fall for the hopium/ FUD.

Name pls?

No we don't.
We need less people like you.
We need adoption, we need use cases, we need scalability. These are the times when all of those problems get quietly worked on, regardless of the price.

Prices don't need to improve for that to happen. They just need to be stable, and people need trust in the currency itself.
Trust is key. Trust that other people will be willing to actually use BTC as a currency, and not just buy and never use it.
I would never accept a dollar for my goods if I didn't trust that somebody else would be willing to take my dollar in exchange for their goods.
Edit: by trust, I suppose I really mean adoption

The fact that people like him are still around tells me that we still have some way to go down. Still a lot of people who invested thinking that this is some "get rich quick" scheme that haven't let go yet.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:22:17
By stable, I don't mean 100% stable. I mean not incredibly volatile.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:30:51
Yeah, that was my understanding too, unfortunately

Btc is flawed and isn't truly decentralised. Crypto needs something better. If IOTA works without the coordinator, it's the future.
If not, then I really don't know
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:11:03
So just how viable is mining from home?
I always thought that it was left for the big companies, but I've wanted to mine since 2011

Attitudes like yours are what threaten widespread BTC adoption.
Caring more about price than adoption. Buying and holding, but never actually spending.
@_date: 2018-07-11 15:56:03
No you don't.
You spend it to promote adoption, and then buy back what you spent with fiat.
The best of both worlds.
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:57:07
Without adoption, I can assure you, you'll be able to buy cheap BTC forever.

To be fair, gold stored under contract isn't your gold. It's the equivalent of storing crypto on an exchange. Any serious gold/silver stacker will tell you the same.

If cryptocurrency keeps growing as it is, with market cycles becoming larger and more frequent, then I'd be interested to see if a correlation occurs between gold and btc during the mass sell off.
The crash from 800 million to 300 million is a 500 million usd loss. Sure, this is spread worldwide, but the cycle seems to roughly double in size each time. I wonder if in the future a mass loss of usd due to crypto would trigger a spike in the price of gold? Partially because gold is a safe haven, and partially because some might consider gold a competitor.
