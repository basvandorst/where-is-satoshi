This! ^ You will lose money, electricity costs at the minimum, failing hardware at the maximum end of the spectrum.  CPU, GPU and older ASICs are not worth the time/effort/money.  Worse is that mining is an "arms race" you constantly have to make sure to buy the biggest/fastest miners out there in order to stay head of the competition.

Agreed, there is something seriously wrong with this company...join us on the following thread:

The summit was to see if they could figure out how to use Bitcoin as a better means to launder money for crooks and the super rich! ;-)  Haha.
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:19:36
I have no idea what's going on with these guys...I have no problem with them wanting to tighten up their KYC, but when it becomes a burden, that's when I say "see ya later!"
Hopefully they're solvent, because BTC can't afford another black eye on top of Mt Gox, money laundring (I forget which company), Silk Road, etc.
Until they either ease up on the KYC overkill and verify they are solvent, I'm out.  Better safe then get Goxxed by Stamp.

Wish you the best of luck mate!

I don't think they were really leaking coins due to some kind of attack.  I think it was a convenient exit for the operator(s) to run off into the night with our BTC.
They've been offline now for 2 days, so I think its safe to say they are gone with the BTC.

We already have multiple currencies in the real world...so mentally equating that to the digital world isn't so confusing as you'd like to make it out to be.  Especially considering a lot of the end-user activities (buying BTC/LTC, spending, wallets, etc.) are nearly the same.
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:21:38
Yep I'm out.
Until they dial back the KYC overkill AND verify their solvency I'm out.  No sense in getting Goxxed twice! :-P

Agreed!

Thanks for the info mate...seems like he got a bunch of us.
Its a shame I can't be an incredible prick like the scammers...I'd have pulled a con and retired on an island somewhere by now...I guess bad things do happen to good people.  :-P
@_date: 2014-05-13 14:26:55
I sure hope its going to be ok, but without any official updates or news from the new owners the whole thing is starting to smell of scam.
The new owner hasn't even tried to reach out to vocial members of Litecointalk to address our questions/concerns.
I get that the new owner wants to do an audit, but he/she should have gotten this done BEFORE buying out the site.  So if he/she is now burdened with whatever issues the previous owner left him then its not the users' fault.  This is only made worse because no one can find any info on the new owners to show the buyout was legit, that its not a scam, etc.
So this is just my caution to everyone to stay way until they get their act together.  No sense in giving these guys any more BTC from noob investors who don't know any better and having them stuck like the rest of us.

I agree, they won't destroy any left over coins... That's like throwing away cash and not even a total idiot would do that.... Sorry not buying that... Especially after the last time MCX went down about a year ago or so...

Looks nice...like Apple finally getting into cryptos.
I'll keep an eye on this for sure for my BTC, LTC, and DOGE needs.

If BTC dropped by 50% or more I'd be buying...same is true for LTC, for which I'm just waiting on bottoming out first.

Yeah, but if JPMorgan's "blockchain" is private running only on their infrastructure (networks/servers) then they essentially get the ability to transfer assets securely within their own ecosystem.  Or if they join forces with other major banking/investment firms they could all participate in this "private blockchain" thus allowing them to centralize their power in this space as well in traditional currencies.  THIS is what they want blockchain tech for...they don't give a rats ass about decentralization as it reduces their power/influence.

I presume that this doesn't apply if my BTC are saved to a paperwallet which doesn't get touched?  It's only for the wallet.dat file, correct?
@_date: 2013-10-10 14:56:21
Sorry mate, wasn't direct at you...but rather my head is "saturated" with all the fan-boyish glee that this could be "IT" for LTC on Gox.

Calm down everyone...I'm a huge fan of LTC but this is NOT going to be an LTC rollout.  
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:18:20
Not sure what the fees are or if BTC price dropped and so valuation is lower? Just guessing.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:11:03
This happened to me before.  I'd suggest you sit tight...it took like 2-3 days but I did finally get their support person to "whitelist" my account since it was obivious I wasn't doing anything "high risk".  Their support person had stated that the algorithm they're using to determine high risk is still being improved over time and it does this from time to time.

I've used Coinbase quite a lot and had good experiences with them.
That being said, I do recall hearing of some folks who've had issues with them.  Glad I'm not one of them, but thought I should let you know this as well for the sake of transparency.
@_date: 2013-08-18 23:19:21
This looks interesting...but...
What happens with this service when GPU mining comes of age for XPM?  I've read many threads where there's alpha/beta GPU code out there...which means it could be ready to mine in the realistic near future.
@_date: 2013-10-08 10:27:41
That sounds like fun!  And there's beer afterwards???  Why am I only finding out about this now??  Sounds like a mini-BTC party and I didn't know I was invited!  :-P
I live in JC so getting into the city is not a big deal...I'll be there nextime.  Is there a group or some entity which sets these up?  My job is a bit shitty so I can't always get away...but if I can get some  advance notice (2 days or so) I'd be able to attend...even if it is just to swill beer and chat about BTC.
@_date: 2013-07-24 09:36:25
I use it to back up my BTC, LTC, and XPM wallet.dat files...
@_date: 2013-08-02 21:59:01
I would have popped $20K for one of these if there was guaranteed date of delivery.  Basically if I'm paying $20K I think its only fair to say "Hey, thanks for your business you'll get this Aug XY, 2013"
  
  
Until ASIC manufacturers can start to produce meaningful and timely batches of hardware, I'm keeping my $ in my pocket.  I know too many buddies who've gotten stuck in the endless pit of BFL.

I wasn't aware that the USB Eruptors could mine other coins besides Bitcoin?  I'd be interested to know anyone who's used one of these bad boys to mine TRC or PPC.  I guess if I understand how these work, it's just a matter of pointing them to a different coin pool?
@_date: 2013-08-09 20:50:26
I think going forward this type of cloud based hashing service and/or group buys is how I'm going to pursue BTC mining.  Considering the difficulty rises, risks to delayed hardware, breakdowns, configuration headaches, and mostly HEAT...I'm done with keeping my small mining operation going at home.
So who knows when ASICS start becoming more readily available and companie slike CloudHashing can deliver in a more timely manner, it maybe worth it to pop some investment dollars towards a few contracts.
@_date: 2013-07-26 00:27:45
Nope.  Unfortunately Bitcoin doesn't have any safeguards or legal protections. 
If someone who doesn't know what their doing (i.e. typical mom/pop user) they're likely to download wallet stealing malware or what not without even realizing it.  And once its gone there's ZERO recourse.
If my credit card is stolen I at least can cancel the card, depending upon my credit card company they may not require me to pay back any fraudulent charges made...if I have a dispute I can have my credit card company intervene.
Some of these "basic" things are just not available with Bitcoin.  I'm a huge fan of crypto, but I find myself being crazy paranoid and quadruple checking everything before any BTC transaction knowing if I mess it up I'm screwed...the BTC is gone and there's little which can be done about it.
I mean just a quick scan of the Bitcointalk forums and you'll see that paranoia runs rampant!  Since BTC transactions are effectively a 1-way door, everyone is extra cautious...It also means that the 1-way door can be exploited by scammers and those who are not cautious are screwed.  While escrow services have helped to faciltate some level of trust -- its all too easy to get burned...that being said I won't deny each of us needs to do our research but this inheirent trait in crypto isn't healthy for building a more postive reputation for Bitcoin let alone for enticing the masses to adopt it.  
So while the likes of the tech-elite or nerds like us can make BTC work for us we are still the early adopters...we are the trailblazers who'll show the path...losing a few along the way as we travel the BTC Trail...along the way new service providers will rise up to help make BTC safer and easier to use for the lay-person...until then mass adoption won't happen...and when mass adoption looks like its on the horizon users will demand legal protections much like those under credit card or fiat lest BTC or any other crypto be just an interesting chapter in the history of technology.
@_date: 2013-07-25 15:01:06
dsyncd, I feel your sentiments.  I showed up late to the ASIC party...and if the different manufacturers deliver even close to their claimed delivery dates (aside from BFL) then trying to buy into ASICs now is a losing strategy for me...which is why I agree with you in that I won't buy anymore mining HW until such time that these guys get their acts together...thus lowering the risks involved.  Until then I'll try to be content with my few GPUs and treating it as a hobby/spectator sport.
@_date: 2013-08-09 18:38:35
Congrats!  I'm glad to hear that they are not the scam some folks made them out to be.  I'll be interested to hear more as/when you are willing to provide updates.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:29:26
True enough...I was thinking some way for it to be insured against say theft, scammers, etc.  But then, I guess escrow services by a trusted entity makes that a moot idea, huh?  Maybe that could be their angle in future...help provide "easy to trust" escrow services to facilitate larger transactions?  Or I guess when it does come to these larger transactions both parties would want to establish some level of trust in each other (even if escrow is used) to ensure both parties are legit.
@_date: 2013-08-06 22:14:54
Because it offers legal protection by a govt entity(ies).
All the bitcoin scammers out there wouldn't be able to get away with their shit if it was regulated.  In the event I'm scammed I'd have legal recourse to try and get my BTC back.
It would also give BTC a greater sense of legitimacy if folks feel there is some govt protection. 
I won't go so far as to say I want a "Fed" for BTC but I do want greater safety...I don't want to to do days/weeks worth of research before spending BTC and getting scewed by operations like BFL and their ilk. If there was some regulation to it folks would be able to grab BFL by their balls and either get a legit refund and/or their goods.
No I'm not a BFL customer...but this is just the best example of why there needs to be govt protections to BTC  -- which cannot happen until there is some form of regulation in place.

I think that going past 2 decimal places is going to be a challenge for the masses (including me).  I have a hard time thinking of money past 2 decimal places.  Given that my context for currency is $1.99 or 10-bucks, or 50cents, etc. it's hard to think of paying for something in 1centiBTC.  It's even more challenging to do the mental arithmatic to figure out if 1centBTC is paying too much for a bottle of beer.  Like going to a foreign country and figuring out money conversions with the added complexity of having to think in metric denominations well past the 2nd decimal.
It will take a long time...the younger generation will be "raised" on thinking of money like this, the older farts like me will die off, and somewhere in between the price will stabilize so a loaf of bread is roughly at parity regardless if I'm using my country's fiat (USD) or BTC to buy it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:14:48
Thinking along the lines of services that banks offer...could it be possible for a bank to offer crypto-currency accounts?  For example, I could go to my local bank, open a "crypto" account. (Yes, I know this sounds odd but pls hear me out).  When I do this I get FDIC coverage on my crypto funds, I'd get maybe a small hardware wallet of some kind which allows me to pay for goods/services where ever I need to across the world.  Additionally since I'm a non-techy person I'd let them worry about keeping my funds secure vs me having to keep various online/offline wallets, losing a smartphone, etc.  
Also, they could still be in the lending business as well, no?  If I want to buy a house and open up a mortgage using BTC as the payment form, they could possibily facilitate that just the same way they'd do with fiat.  Or perhaps earn interest by opening a crypto "savings" account.  If I've got some BTC laying around and I know I don't want to spend it for say months/years, why not earn a few Satoshi on the BTC for that?  Or they could act as "big name" escrow houses to facilitate larger transactions to ensure no one gets screwed.  Or perhaps they could act as middlemen for peer-to-peer loans like lendingclub or prosper? 
In general these banks have large brand names which they could use to make a new market for themselves in the crypto-world.
Just thinking that perhaps banks maybe around just offering services/products geared more towards the unique properties of crypto instead of fiat.
Edit: Since it's a bank issued hardware wallet, if I lose it I can make 1 call and its deactivated.  The idea being it makes it easier to spend crytpo without relying on smartphones...last thing I'd want is my phone to run out of power before i can pay for my dinner at some fancy restaurant.
@_date: 2013-07-09 15:44:04
I wouldn't have guessed...but it does make sense.  So they're not entirely useless if I decided to move away from BTC and towards other SHA256 coins.  That's really good to know!  Thanks!

Oh one other idea I had was banks could help faciliate "Estate Services".  They could make it easier for nerdy folks to leave behind crypto currencies and make sure they get passed out to the relevant persons per the instructions in my will.
