People on sound like newbie drug dealers/money launderers.
People with way more power, assets and connections than you guys have tried to hide their income from the IRS and failed.
If you want to risk jail time and hefty fines over the measly profit you made, that's your business.  But it's really stupid.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:52:35
This definitely sounds like something the masses will adopt.  It's so easy to use!  You only need four, completely offline disks!
@_date: 2014-09-20 23:31:53
They're not. More people are currently leaving bitcoin than are coming into it, that is why the price is falling.
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:15:56
No kidding.  If you're willing to lose all your shit and go to jail, go ahead and "hide" stuff from the IRS.  Good luck with that though.  People with much more money and power have tried and failed.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:47:14
I decided to go through his post history because of this comment and you weren't joking.  What a shill...
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:03:45
2500 new customers isn't a big increase for a company like amazon.  It's not even something noticeable. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:38:22
So?... There are no regulations in Bitcoin.  Why would there be anything against insider trading?
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:20:56
You linked a Wikipedia article about the purpose of using fraud, as a point to somehow prove that this is fraud?  Nice...
Of COURSE defrauding people out of money or valuables is the purpose of fraud.  I don't think anyone needs a Wikipedia article to explain that to them.  That doesn't mean selling your bitcoin before an announcement is fraud.  It would be insider trading at best which is different and has its own set of laws to govern it.  Which also do not apply to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:35:07
No, if you lose a your wallet that has a piece of paper with your private key on it, your bitcoins are gone.  Someone can just move them out.  Having a backup copy of it just makes it more likely
@_date: 2014-04-01 21:30:32
...How did you wind up with $400+ in Dogecoins?  That's insane.
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:48:19
Yeah, I'm sure their sales figures going up 0.01% will be HUGE news!
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:33:50
"This is actually a GOOD thing!"
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:18:42
Yeah, lying to the IRS is a sure way to get yourself some serious jail time and fines.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:05:11
No. I invest in index funds only, no actively managed funds, and hold only a few thousand in each of my bank accounts.
Just because I don't trust them to be ethical doesn't mean I don't use them.
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:19:56
Pretty easy actually.  How do you figure they catch most money launderers? 
The IRS isn't your mother.  They can get access to pretty much everything you do.
@_date: 2014-12-29 16:39:41
If your currency is impacted by trolls, the problems run much deeper than the trolls themselves.
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:48:01
I don't really have involvement in either currency, but I do absolutely love the Doge community.  It reminds me a lot of how was last year.
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:28:58
So the currency of the future is a HUGE step back from current day online banking?
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:07:12
Lose paper wallet, lose your entire account with no hope of ever getting it back...
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:32:56
Sure.  But what banking industry IS ethical?  I certainly don't trust any of those crooks myself.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:02:18
Uh... And what exactly happens if one of your many backups becomes compromised?  You still lose your money regardless.
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:55:32
No, but that doesn't mean they can't hit you with ridiculous fines and jail if you do get audited and they find anything not reported.
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:37:10
If your goal is to make a cheaper Paypal, why not just make a copy of Paypal with cheaper fees?  It will be a lot less overhead. 
Paypal has nothing to do with the currency itself.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:04:49
How is that fraud?  Insider trading is only illegal because it is explicitly illegal.  Nothing here is fraudulent.  There is no deception or lying...
@_date: 2015-07-16 15:30:26
You wouldn't donate at all either way.  Don't act like you would be charitable if only they promoted something in your interest.
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:42:59
Always nice to see these pop up.  You're definitely improving the community image.  Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:19:02
Bitcoin is a zero-sum game.  Every winner in Bitcoin has a loser.  The majority of winners are the minority of people (early adopters).  The average Joe is losing in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-12 22:38:44
Except the bank will refund you for fraudulent charges.  Bitcoin is specially set up to NOT allow chargebacks. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:38:27
Are you mining to pay your rent or are you converting USD to Bitcoins in order to use a service that converts Bitcoins back to USD to pay bills?
Not sure I understand the point if the latter.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:10:55
Would be a better analogy if you said crypocurrencies won't go away.  Maybe litecoins will take off.
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:06:37
This isn't some magic money making machine... Bitcoin is a zero sum game.  For every dollar someone earns, someone else must lose a dollar.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:52:42
It's also not refundable.  You pay for the security those tools provide.
Visa isn't a currency, it is a tool the protects the buyer.
If you buy something from a non reputable company or they overcharge you? You have no way of getting that money back with Bitcoin until a company like acts as a middleman.
@_date: 2013-06-04 21:31:25
But he is essentially cashing out to pay rent... It's not like his landlord is accepting bitcoin as a currency.  They are still dealing in USD.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:21:33
If you cash out, you have to pay taxes on your gains.  If you never cash out, you don't pay taxes.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:12:41
I mean people saying stuff like "What is this magic?" and people giving them money.
I see people try it in just about every Bitcoin related thread I go to... Given I only go to the more popular ones.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:24:26
If you're waiting for signs of a crash to sell, you already missed the boat.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:24:11
Is ANYONE else interesting in buying it from you?... Zero.
You two can trade back and forth if you want, but without mass public interest, the value is zero.  You two might as well trade candy wrappers for money.
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:13:18
Bitcoin is a zero sum game.  If you are "winning" someone else in the community is losing.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:17:37
Anyone who accepted bitcoin payments for goods at the going rate of $250/coin lost big time.
It's too volatile for any business to support right now.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:47:36
He made quite a bit of free money off it, so there's that...
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:44:07
Hahahahahaha..... Yeah I'm sure the FBI is going to be dispatched to track down this guys missing BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:35:57
All the money in the world wont save you from an ailment that has no cure.  Ask Steve Jobs.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:15:10
If you buy EVERY bitcoin in existence and no one else wants to buy them from you, what is the value of the coins you hold? $0
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:23:00
That's INSANE! You threw away nearly $6,000 due to a poor system...
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:48:42
That's assuming it is successful... which is a HUGE assumption.
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:33:20
There has to be a buyer for every seller.  If bitcoin suddenly halved in value, you might not be able to sell your coins for anything at all.
@_date: 2013-07-04 05:11:56
If you're looking for an investment, you're in the wrong place.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:19:17
If you can't handle the possibility of a crash and losing your money, you should cash out.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:58:03
You'd be better off just buying one than using what likely is going to cost you more in electricity than it is worth.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:50:05
You want Bitcoin to succeed because you chose a terrible bank?
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:35:44
The money came from exchanging dollars for bitcoin back to dollars.  The "man" didn't lose anything.  Another user bought bitcoins from this user using USD.
Basically another user paid his loans for him.
@_date: 2013-08-13 15:44:54
Then what is the POINT?  That is one of the key features people cite as a good thing about Bitcoin.  You add the ability to do chargeback and you just made your currency traceable. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 16:41:35
Sounds like tax evasion.  I would be VERY surprised if any legitimate company tried that and managed to not get caught by the IRS.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:09:53
In that case... What is the point? You convert your money from USD to Bitcoin to spend on a product which is actually paid for with USD anyways?
How is that any different than just buying the product with USD in the first place?
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:17:46
This example might be before your time, or at least dating a lot of the Reddit population, but it still holds true.
You could have said the same thing about Beanie Babies.  Everyone thought they would only go up in value because a HUGE population wanted them and considered them valuable... When the bottom fell out and suddenly no one wanted them, the hoarders were left with worthless stuffed animals.
And that was a PHYSICAL commodity, not just an imaginary number.
But this time it's different, right?
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:37:52
Okay, let me rephrase that.  The quick buying/selling to manipulate the market and "make" money, as suggested by the user I was replying to, is a zero-sum game.  The value of bitcoin as used as a currency and deflationary value is not.
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:47:10
...Wow, you're just ASKING to be scammed.
Buy your OS or switch to something that is legitimately free.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:27:35
Yup.  And you you try to dodge it, expect some hefty fines and jail time to come with.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:57:57
Doesn't seem to be very many.  Most of the recent joiners are just using it as a temporary investment vehicle. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:29:41
I think you're going to get pissed off customers either way.  If Bitcoin goes UP in value, of course they're not going to be happy if you give them the dollar equivalent. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:31:02
If the dollar crumbles, we have MUCH bigger issues on a global scale that bitcoin will not solve.
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:09:09
It IS a bad thing when money continues to inflate.  It encourages hoarding rather than spending which hurts the economy.
@_date: 2013-02-13 21:46:13
Bankruptcy is always an option?... I don't think you've looked into this very carefully.  It sounds like you're going to end up hurting your family pretty badly with some really poor decisions.
@_date: 2013-04-29 00:23:47
I don't use RES myself... but if it improves Reddit so much, why isn't it embedded in the website?  Have you contacted the devs about it?
I always hear people saying how great it is.  I mostly don't want to bother because a lot of my Redditing is from a work computer, but I would love to see some of the features it has in the base site.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:28:13
What is the point if you are going to buy it and hide it away?  Isn't the point to use it as a currency, not an investment?
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:02:54
If it goes that low, what makes you think it would ever return?  If it ever goes that low, that would mean nearly the entire bitcoin community has moved on to something else.
@_date: 2013-06-10 19:34:07
Not true at all.  My first check was processed as direct deposit. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:27:58
...They can and do.  You might want to look into that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:30:27
In this thread, people hoping to get a big tip from the billionaire. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:11:19
The banks all report large, undocumented deposits to the IRS.
If you want to try to dodge taxes though, that's your problem.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:16:17
Considering the entire US market is held and paid in USD, that is extremely unlikely.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:40:13
People want anonymity and no regulation... this comes with that territory. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:16:04
I read that as a guy who adopted a dog from profits of bitcoins. He didn't use bitcoins themselves as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:49:14
Hahaha.  Good luck with that.
"Bring regulation to Bitcoin!"
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:27:23
I can't believe that still works...
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:08:11
It's also bad for economies.  It encourages hoarding rather than spending.
