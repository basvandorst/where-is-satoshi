The core dev will be adding tiernolan atomic swaps direct wallet to wallet in thenear future. Currently all the nxt assets you can buy on instantdex are already traded in a decentralized way. Also mgw is not centralized still, and it has close to little to do with instantdex except being convinient to handle btc for now as the system is already in place and trusted. You'll find all those infos on the multigateway website and their source are open.

mgwBTC, are backed 1 to 1 by BTC and you can see the holdings at all time. So I don't see a big difference, it's way different than the ripple IOU for example where you have to trust a centralized gateway. Here they are 3 mgw servers that have to reach concensus to make a deposit / withdraw. And that is just the beginning...
