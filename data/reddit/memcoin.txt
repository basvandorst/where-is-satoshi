we are not beggars we are contributors, in this scenario Wikipedia is the beggar who also has proven to be quite fussy about what donations meet their criteria.

Then satoshi seriously fucked up allowing a bitcoin to be divided 10 million times.

This is good news, I spoke with them regarding the practice of accepting bitcoin but not having any bitcoins. Im glad they took onboard my feedback, guess I will have to update my gambling list again.
They really do not like being used as an exchange and will charge you a 5% charge when withdrawing if you have simply converted from $ -&gt; BTC.

sorry but btc is simply not ready yet for the average end user.  
The satoshi client serves as newbie repellent right now.

You either adapt or get left behind, they chose to get left behind.

I play on seals mainly but they usually have 4-12 players online for my time (AU).
I shall have to give their site another trial and see how the BTC games are going.

this is just bitpay doing some shameless self promotion.  
We are all painfully aware that its easy to convert btc to USD in order to donate, this is not our goal.

ugh, SA is like a forgotten 4chan thats really bitchy about being forgotten.

as a *nix software engineer imho it did, all the user land applications from GNU started off being used on other platforms independent of linux.
Stick to metaphors you know Jon ;)
GNU =! Linux

keep up the good work :)

polite requests will help a lot more than your childish blog posts.

lets wait and watch the bitcoin devs kill interest in their own platform you mean.
The current default client is an adoption killer.
