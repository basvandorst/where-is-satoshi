I’d turn my head AND cough.

Or we are the dominant timeline and we need to invent it first.

Limit sells and limit buys. Small volume that’s fine and I had fun watching the market to make a dollar but large volumes you are correct the fees would be too much and there may be slippage outside of limits - if those limits were something other than fill or kill

The total dollars is a bit misleading because a lot of people just sell and buy back for various reasons. 
For example, I was bored one day with a sideways market and sold 1 litecoin for $51, bought it back at $50.50, sold it for $51, then bought it back for $50.50. Although I only made $1, my trading volume was around $200.

Oh I was probably wrong then.
But I was right the first time! I hope.

Those people also contributed to the market volume.
Mine was personally around $200. Those people who bought and sold that same coin I was trading (over and over again) also contributed about $200 in volume so I guess you could say “we” did at least $400 further proving my point.

Don’t worry I’m doing you all a favor by not buying. The moment I buy one is the moment it crashes.

If I understand correctly these futures are basically half people assuming this is a short term bump and will go down, so they are selling the contracts. The other half think it will continue to climb so they are buying the contracts.
I like seeing the high volume either way.
