He’s an idiot unfortunately.

I think maybe the more likely answer is he's a dumbass.  
Edit: Or IDK maybe this is some 7-D chess play that's way over all our heads???

Looks like they offered Bitmain a tax break but then pulled it back when the jobs never came to town. They bet,,, but it's not like they really lost anything.

We really should retire it.

Ironically the price will likely stabilize back to 11,100 to 11,300 so for all these people who got burned on the shorts-- now would be the time to short.  
Then again, options trading with bitcoin is a complete crapshoot.

Dude says the dollar is the strongest currency after telling his staff to find ways to de-value the dollar.  LOL okay.

This is dumb.  Banks trade in currency. They don't prop it up. Governments do. If the banks survival was on the line in the short term, they would accept Bitcoin tomorrow. It's inevitable.

"What's Bitcoin?"  My mom....

8 to 9 feels like the right amount based on the average last four month trajectory so I’m waiting for it to settle close to that before I buy more.  
But then again this is Bitcoin.  It could stay at 11, shoot to 13, or drop to 7. I’m just here for the ride.

Both you guys have a great idea actually.
