Thanks for the scenario. I have a couple more questions now :)


How? (In terms of Lightning, not in terms of hotdog conveyance.)


What is the incentive to pass the hotdog along if he's going to have to pay a fee? Wouldn't everyone have to pay a fee all the way to the vendor and back to the customer? Wouldn't that sum ultimately be paid by the customer? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:21:25

I'm not fighting anything. It's a reasonable conclusion that if eBay isn't even "there yet" transacting in bitcoin, they're certainly nowhere near transacting on the exotic Lightning Network.

There's a lot going on in the world outside of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Definitely a contender if public interest continues to swell, but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't seem likely.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:21:35






Does that mean that *A* would have to trust everyone along the way to *G* to actually follow-through? Kind of like passing a hotdog down down a row of stadium seats, and money back to the vendor?

I can't wait to see the wacky, newfangled services that legacy institutions will try to bolt onto the bitcoin network.  Every single one of them deserves a seat at the market, and I'm sure that a few will create undeniably useful services that will attract customers.  And *those services* can be regulated, taxed, "matured," and their users identified all day long.  Most of it will legitimize bitcoin, yet none of it will affect our direct access to the network.

USA regulators did not shut down Bitfloor.  Bitfloor's bank closed their accounts, and Roman Shtylman shut the site down by his own accord.  He returned some of his customers' USD, but he kept all of their bitcoin for himself.  Don't blame Bitcoin for bad people.

Ok, fine, you two have completely different philosophies about money.  But the beauty of Bitcoin is that it supports both--your barebones "SMTP" level transactions for expert users, as well as his "just like my old bank" convenience transactions attractive to the average consumer.  The former will always be there for anyone who wants it, while the latter is essential for widespread adoption.

I doubt anyone is champing at the bit for this, but it would be useful for dutiful tax payers to have a bitcoin wallet that automatically tracks the cost basis.  You would only have to associate the USD value of bitcoin at the time of purchase, and it would keep track of the USD value of goods and services transactions. It would also be nice if the wallet tried to spend from the oldest bitcoin transactions first, to take advantage of long term gains where possible.

I had a similar idea, but not to circumvent regulations.  I think that drivers should be liberated from the middlemen.  Lyft and Uber offer little support and protection to their drivers, yet they take as much of their revenue as possible.  It might look like a decent way to earn some "spare cash" to many drivers, but they deserve greater compensation for their services.
A decentralized rideshare marketplace facilitated by open source software could cut the exploiters out of the picture.

I agree. If your marriage is so brittle that the sudden appearance of money breaks it, it'll probably break for other--far more common--life-changing events.

This is the first time I have heard of Bitsquare and after some light research I have become enthusiastic. The barrier to entry is tremendous compared to Kickstarter, and that surely discourages many potential supporters. But I see an opportunity to learn something, so  I will definitely contribute.

Whoa. Microsoft's identity tech is on the BITCOIN blockchain? Finally, a significant tech company isn't rolling their own blockchain. And Microsoft, of all companies. For decades they have offered their own closed solutions to common problems and locked companies into their ecosystem. They really are heading in a new direction. (Oh, also, yay for bitcoin!)

The content of this piece aside, is CNBC the only mainstream news program that covers Bitcoin regularly?  It seems that 70% of the "just saw this on TV" posts reference CNBC.  Any publicity is good publicity.

[In this interview]( the owner of the Allentown Subway franchise claims that bitcoin transactions take no longer than credit card transactions.  I'm going to guess that either the merchant or the 3rd party offering the POS service is taking a small risk with each transaction for this convenience. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:19:43
That's a good point.  But why is this a problem? An investment is really a loan, and the party you "invest" in--in the best outcome--makes proportionally more money than you do.  In the worst outcome, you lose your investment.  It's a necessary risk in an inflationary economy, but absurd in deflationary one where your money grows in value without any bullshit.

Good questions, elan96.  If you (very slowly) download the complete historical data, it's only as fresh as the day you downloaded it.  You have to update it regularly to get new data.
I can't find an easy way to get arbitrary daily BTC price averages.  If you know a source, please share.  And even if such a simple service were available, how would you get the prices for two dozen days? I think automation always helps.

Keep in mind that anyone who calculates the return-on-investment of mining hardware is using the USD value of BTC today.  The USD value of BTC in 5 or 10 years could be quite different, and the ROI could be incredible. 
I have a couple ASICs currently mining me .01 BTC a day.  They might pay themselves off within 6 months.  I learned a lot about BTC through joining a pool, and it's fun to watch the pool data; it keeps my finger on the pulse of the source of BTC.
Having said that, if you have $x that you want to *invest* right now, you should buy BTC directly.

I've been profitable with my 7 GH/s jalapeño.  Thanks to BTC prices I earned back my investment in about a month and a half, and I make about .05 BTC every 10 days now.  Of course, I had expected to start mining shortly after ordering it in March 2013, but didn't receive the rig until October.

It's not a joke, per se.  I think the implication is, "My fiance is going to be so excited about this news that she will die, figuratively." But until 5 seconds ago, I thought that it was a literal nonsequitur, and I couldn't figure out why no one thought that was interesting.

I was surprised to learn that they were "performing paid research for the Citi Foundation."  At first I thought that this was an effort to smear bitcoin, but looking at the [Citi Foundation Web site]( I'm willing to believe they are evaluating Bitcoin as tool for their philanthropic mission, or as part of a grant proposal they received:

Good question. I was surprised to receive the call, and I don't remember explicitly granting them permission to contact me or to share my information.  I was too curious about the nature of the call to consider these things at the time.

I started working on this but I found that there's no fast and easy way to get historical daily averages.  bitcoincharts.com has a good API, but it's slow and they throttle requests.  They also offer a 261MB CSV of historical data, but you have to calculate the daily averages yourself, and then update it regularly. 
UPDATE: Here you go.  I got the data straight from Mt. Gox: 
Right now it only calculates average daily USD based on the first 1000 transactions reported from the API.  I will update this to fetch all of the day's transactions soon.

Thank you for taking the time and effort to post those excerpts.  After reading them my confidence in the Foundation is restored. I believe that:
1. The Foundation feels that that redlisting/blacklisting/tainting/tracking is not within their purview and will not be implemented technically
2. Discussing these theoretical issues is absolutely necessary despite inevitable witch hunting.

The "new data" is several thousand individual transactions that need to be averaged to generate the day's average price. The script I linked to does this, and stores the final result in a text file e.g. 20131109,386.56.
