Kryptokit is one of the most exciting and fastest developed wallet in the cryptocurrency space. I really believe it will be a powerhouse in the coming months.

Charles Hoskinson from BEP here. I've looked over the design of Kryptokit and while it still has some work that needs to be done, the design is solid from a security perspective. They have an excellent team and will quickly iterate KK into a powerhouse.

I sent them an email today about this omission. I'd not entirely sure why we are not listed. I hope it was just a mistake.

I helped develop some of the theory with Stan larimer back when I was the CEO of invictus. It is an interesting topic but has yet to solidify as an independent and refined domain of thought. DACs need a few years to gain some community terminology as well as utility. Also the notion is not entirely original as both mike hearn and Greg maxwell have been discussing agents making autonomous decisions and interacting with blockchains for over three years.

To quote a famous physicist, this analysis is not even wrong. You are claiming a product that has yet to be released and has no premine alongside a testing phase is somehow a ponzi. All you have done is make unsupported claims and attacked the integrity of people who are releasing free software.  
Meanwhile you are asking the same community to give you 300k for your own idea. Crawl back into whatever scumbag hole that birthed you
