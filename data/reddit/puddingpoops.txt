Have you ever known someone that bought a new car as an investment? That's... Not a thing.
I mean, with your logic.. why ever buy anything at all? You'll never get your money back for that tv, or computer. Better not buy a cell phone. That iPad is a total money pit.  Just invest it all in a speculative commodity that has gone from 20k to 3k in a little over a year. Way smarter.

I'm playing at having an honest discussion about what Bitcoin is vs what bcash and bsv are. 
Yes, Ive been involved in btc foe a long time. Tbat doesn't mean I believe in it, or have any idea about these other forks. For all the shit they get, Im hoping someone can explain, in simple terms, why btc is more valuable than anything else.  And more so . Why other cryptos are "scams", and Bitcoin isn't.
Yes, I made a lot on Bitcoin. But not because I believed in it, necessarily, more because others did and I made money because of it.
@_date: 2019-08-27 04:59:00
But like.. why is it so bad is what I'm asking. like . What makes it a scam vs Bitcoin being a scam.. other than "we were first"
@_date: 2019-08-27 06:06:26
Seems like there are 10000 different opinions on why bcash/bsv etc. Are the worst. I just can't figure out, beyond speculation about network performance, why one is better than the other
Or, frankly, why we need any of them. Banks be damned.. they made shit easy. Maybe one of these coins will too, but for my parents.. it's not as of now
@_date: 2019-08-27 05:11:19
I'm not trying to be a dick, but how is Bitcoin "real gold"?  was it.just around earlier? 
I'm just trying to understand what the differences are (bias aside), and why one is better than the other. Your response seems like "Bitcoin is best. Cause it was first". Fair, I guess. But not the answer I'm looking for.
@_date: 2019-02-15 12:37:14
Uh. Yes?
Do you have an actual response?
Do you also believe every ccn etc article saying "bitcoin investor says Bitcoin will reach a million dollars"?
I just don't get it. For 99% of people it's just one more step. That much bigger of a hassle. "I spent .000000007 of a Bitcoin, so I have . Uh. I dunno how much money now. Is btc up 200 or down 300 today"
Maybe one day btc (or, imho, a successor), will be something people might use every day. But if it is, why would we want to to go to the store and say "oh, .00008 btc, perfect that's just what I wanted to spend." It doesn't make sense to me . If one btc = 1 dollar, maybe. But your average housewife/stay at home dad, etc, loving check to check doesn't want to deal with that. 
Let's face it. Btc is based on cool tech, but it is an "investment" tool atm. Most people with btc don't even try to pretend it's usable outside this sub
Typically, I don't invest in hashes. Because it's artificial and means nothing. If someone can justify it's "value" (artificial scarcity doesn't count) I'll change my mind . Ive yet to see it.
@_date: 2019-06-06 08:03:31
It will be interesting. 
Will it be Bitcoin? Obviously not. But the fact that their platform is what it is may make this a "useable" thing for a lot of laymen. I don't like this method, but .. whatever.
In the long run, I think if they are successful, it could only be good for Bitcoin. If they fail, it won't affect the current ecosystem, imho.
I hope people use it, like it, and it turns millions more people on to Bitcoin, the og, the real deal.
I mean, could anyone imagine a world where Facebook's digital currency is more valued than Bitcoin? I sure can't. But their success, and exposure to a fucking massive audience can't hurt.

I'm by no means a Bitcoin hater, so don't get me wrong. I absolutely love the tech and the ideology behind it. 
I just struggle to see why it's worth... Anything.. if the majority of people say "okay, I'm gonna just hold on to this until I can retire on it". Real world utility is absolutely a key to it's success, and without it, in my eyes, it's worthless. People actually spending, rather than holding, is what makes it worth something. Businesses accepting make it worth something. Otherwise it's not much more than a hash, a line of code..however you want to look at it.

That your money isn't insured? That your btc can fluctuate $1000 in a day? That there's almost 0 real world utility? I'd go on, but I'm drunk. Paid for my drinks in Fiat. Cause nearly nobody gives a fuck about btc.
@_date: 2019-12-21 22:25:37
That's fair I guess.. but why are regular atm fees so low in comparison? I mean, most ATMs I've been to that have a fee are about $4. I can get 20 or 1000 dollars, doesn't matter. Seems like taking a % instead of a fixed amount... Is... Shitty.
If I'm paying 7% every time I use the atm, I'm going to find other ways to get cash.
@_date: 2019-12-04 10:59:05
But isn't the goal of Bitcoin (or, Satoshi, specifically), to be a means of exchange?
"If bitcoin surges becaue people hold it as a reserve of value, then it will eventually reach a higher volume and market cap"
This seems contradictory. If everyone is holding, why would trade volume go up? Maybe I'm missing something. Every evangelist can downvote all they want, but if btc isn't used for anything, it has no value.
I fundamentally disagree with you, I think. To me, trade volume (as far as you going to your local store, and using btc instead of cash), is what makes bitcoin hold value. People just buying it cause it's the "in" thing doesn't give it value beyond a couple years. And people who buy it because it's the "in" thing will be sorely disappointed if satoshis vision of using btc as a means of exchange will be sorely disappointed. 
As I said before, lots of things are scarce, that doesn't give them value .
Also, please keep downvoting me for giving a reasonable, if not always correct opinion. It's just that. An opinion. I thought I was contributing to a discussion, but I guess j forgot how strong the cult of belief is.
"Hodl" will kill Bitcoin , and is the exact opposite of everything Satoshi imagined.

No doubt it's a success. Obviously. It and it's successors/imitators/whayever are changing the world in a lot of ways. I'm just saying that in order to maintain any value it can't be solely a "buy and hold" thing.

@_date: 2019-04-12 22:07:05
Your bias is incredible.
The charges have 0 to do with publishing.
They have everything to do with encouraging, and aiding a criminal performing a criminal act. That's textbook conspiracy no matter how you look at it. The chatlogs showing that he did this were released years ago.
Again, arguing about what assange has published is entirely irrelevant. That has nothing to do with the charges he's facing.
@_date: 2019-12-04 09:21:19
I don't think fomo will ever reach levels it did in 2017. The number of people who lost their savings/retirement/etc. Was huge after the run up to 20k and subsequent drop.
I think people will be WAY more skeptical in the future, as far as looking at Bitcoin as either an investment or get rich quick plan. 
The key to Bitcoin having or maintaining any real value is people wanting to use it. If it's not being actively used and adoption spreading... Why is it worth dick? Plenty of things are rare/limited..  and most of them aren't worth shit. If people don't continue to decide they want to use Bitcoin, not just hodl, it is going to end up as a trend, not something with real value
Edit: Can anyone who doqnvotes actually come up with a counter? Im genuinely interested in others thought and ideas... But I just get doqnvotes and one response?

The chatlogs that were released years ago show him offering to crack passwords. In fact, he says he has rainbow tables for the hashes Manning needs cracked.
Again, you can claim it's "journalism", but if he hadn't conspired to hack government systems, he wouldn't have been arrested. And people talk about precedent, and how this is "dangerous" for journalism. It's not. It would be dangerous to let hackers do whatever they want as long as they claim it was for "journalism"
@_date: 2019-04-12 02:22:40
The point is, assange encouraged, and aided a criminal committing a crime. That in turn makes assange guilty. Simple as that. If they can prove he was the one in contact with Manning, it's pretty open and shut.
The morality of leaking isn't the question here. 
I agree, Manning should have done something more like snowden- leak to actual respected journalists.
@_date: 2019-04-12 09:08:44
Good point.  Totally nailed it.
Go ahead. Tell me where I'm wrong. Chatlogs showing j encouraging and helping Chelsea were released years ago. Where the fuck you been?
I'll wait.
A crime is a crime. If he's your savior then so be it... He's still a criminal, regardless. If you wanna change shit, vote, but right now conspiracy to commit a crime is a crime.. That's all I can tell you.

Chatlogs released years ago show him offering to crack passwords for Manning, including telling him they have rainbow tables for the hashes he needs cracked.

How are they bogus when they are literally by the book conspiracy charges? How are they "fabricated"? We've all seen the chat logs.

For most folks.. not worth it.

The irony. He's not charged with anything publishing related.
Do you believe that people should be free to hack the department of defense hoping to find something newsworthy? 
Because that's what he and Manning did, and that's what he's been charged with. Not for publishing leaked information. For conspiracy to hack government computers. If you don't think thats a crime.. well.. I dunno what to tell you.
@_date: 2019-04-28 13:28:49
I don't disagree with anything you've said.
But again, imagine you're totally ignorant of Bitcoin. You have a savings account making 1-3% guaranteed. (Plus, if your money is stolen, you can get it back)
Now, you can put your spending money in a "wallet" that could make 20% or lose 20% this year. You can also only spend this money at a select few retailers.
I love Bitcoin , but I still don't know why the fuck you average consumer would care, let alone put money in it.
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:03:13
I'm not missing the point. I'm simply making the  opposite point as you are.

Convince a large % of 35+ parents that this is "smart" and maybe you'll get there. But.......you won't.
Having no trusted party is an advantage to a small minority, not the majority of daily spenders. Not now, not ever.
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:43:24
This is a huge issue usually ignored by btc evangelists.
My debit card/pin has been stolen twice in the last decade. Maybe I have bad luck.. I dunno.. but either way I got all my money back from my bank. With btc, I'd just be bankrupt if I didn't find out extremely quick and manage to stop it.
@_date: 2019-04-15 08:34:49
Just because I just saw this
I think that it's fair to say that the government has a case. And keep in mind, assange hasn't been convicted of anything. So this could go either way 
This article also explores both why assange is probably guilty, and why the cfaa may need work (I think we all know it does.. but face it, assange isn't exactly Aaron Swartz(fuck Quinn Norton)) It will be an interesting case no matter what happens.

@_date: 2019-04-12 23:58:36
I know he didn't break in. He encouraged and aided Manning in procuring the documents. This is documented in their chat logs. This is the definition of conspiracy. I don't understand how people don't get it. He was charged with conspiracy and that's exactly the crime assange committed. For the 100th time. THE CHARGE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT HE PUBLISHED.
It's not fabricated. It's documented.
@_date: 2019-04-12 09:38:38

G'Night, cutie.
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:09:33
Except that's not what he's charged with. It's nothing to do with publishing. It's conspiracy to hack government computers. Which is obviously a crime. It's a crime that is in the chatlogs with Manning. Cracking passwords for the explicit purpose of gaining unauthorized access to government computers isnt "publishing", or "journalism". It's conspiracy plain and simple.
But I'm sure WikiLeaks will keep pushing this "he got arrested for journalism!" narrative and many of their idiot followers will.just believe it.
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:56:49
Ithis happened to literally anyone, any company, etc., The perpetrator would be charged.  Assange /WikiLeaks or not. Yes, people get paid to so this kinda thing. Ya know.. like cops, and FBI agents, etc. It's their job.
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:48:23
Right. But that's what I'm getting at.
It is an issue. And it can't be fixed. 
That's why 99% of people, even if they use Bitcoin, will only have a small % of their spendable dollars in it. You can't afford to get fucked in an irreversible system.
Hodlers (probably 95% of the btc ecosystem) won't worry , because their details are never exposed. A normal consumer, however, has to consider this risk.

Assange literally said, of afghans who worked with their government against Al qaeda, "these people were collaborators, informants. They deserve to die". what a guy.
He doesn't care about redactions, which is why tons of names, troop movements, etc. In the docs he released. There's a reason Snowden specifically chose not to include WikiLeaks.
The Nsa guys before didn't have documents. They just had their word. 
Not particularly interested in greenwalds opinion of assange. I agree with him on a lot of things, but he's simply wrong about this. Commit a crime, expect to get arrested. I don't know what all the fuss is about. He hasn't been found guilty yet. He'll get his day in court.

@_date: 2019-04-11 21:31:46
Manning downloaded files en masse. He didn't discriminate. He didn't know what he was taking. He left that up to assange. Could there have been crimes? Sure but he didn't know that.
You could be right... The problem is, he did commit a crime, without question. So we'll never know the hypothetical "would he have been arrested anyway".
Personally, I don't think Julian is a journalist at all. He publishes leaks. So sure, publisher.  But real journalists are responsible, careful, and offer more than just "hey look at this". The Snowden leaks were only as huge as they we're because actual journalists took the time to analyze and understand the documents, and their context, and explain to people what they were looking at.
@_date: 2019-04-28 13:02:41
Of course not.
And that's why bitcoin will never be what evangelists think it will. It will never, ever, in a million years, replace banks. It won't ever be close. Because people want simplicity, and security. That's what banks provide and Bitcoin never will. The protocol is simply not capable of providing what a bank can.

It's the exact same service offered by 100 other companies. With no insurance, no refunds, less participants, and a higher barrier to entry.

How often does btc really get used? Seems like it's pretty established that it's an investment for most people, not something they are ever going to spend, until they cash out. 
In fact, it seems like the value v the dollar wouldn't matter much if the point was to spend it, not hold it, right? If the point is, get btc so I can spend it, I don't really care if 1 bitcoin is $1 or $5000. Its clearly nowhere remotely close to stable enough to be used that way since it's likely I'd lose a large percentage of my money if i did.

So, anecdotal, but almost everyone I know (as a 31 y/o American) has, and uses venmo...at least occasionally.
It really is super easy and convenient. No wallets, no exchanges.. just money = money. It's still pretty relevant for my gen, most of whom say "yeah, Bitcoin died a while ago, right?"
Cause venmo is still 1000 times easier and more convenient than btc
Say what you will, but convenience reigns king. Btc is nowhere close.
@_date: 2019-01-21 16:37:21
Can you give me examples of useful smart contracts made with Bitcoin, and their relevance outside of the btc echo chamber? It seems like if it was so useful, people/businesses would be like... Using them. I mean, what are the real world applications here? What about these smart contracts improves on already existing tech/businesses? What makes btc better than...let's say ethereum, etc. in this respect?
I'm not trying to be a dick, just trying to understand better.
@_date: 2019-01-21 07:42:24
Sure, but maybe not the transactions you want as an up and coming technology. I guess the question is.. how does btc become convenient/usable for the every day consumer when cash is readily available/accepted.. everywhere. I mean... Why would something so volatile (as of now) compete with the stable (usually), default currency(ies)? How can it be more convenient for someone paid in fiat to use btc? I always know what my dollar is worth. With btc, I have to check every day if it's up or down..with 100+ dollar swings, and usually fiat fees to acquire it.
I'm sort of playing devil's advocate here.. but I've also been a bit disillusioned over the last few years re: Bitcoin. Ftr, I'm not hating. I love the idea of Bitcoin , I just have recently wondered how it can really be viable aside from a speculative investment with no stability(yet)... and no reason, aside from btc owners saying so, that it's valuable.
Also, as one place that posts seemingly every bit of the most minor news/irrelevant, boring btc stories, pics of every single btc .. uh.. anything.. I'd expect more talk about actually spending it on here. Frankly, it seems telling that there isn't.
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:08:38
I agree on that. Bitcoin is huge for making illegal transactions. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:50:49
This seems pretty misleading considering both people and exchanges literally just moving their money around , not actually making transactions. If I have btc in a wallet, I have to transfer a wallet on exchange, then transfer again to sell.  The buyer then takes his new btc and transfers it.off the exchange. 1 transaction is now 3.
Point is, tons of stuff gets counted twice and tons and tons of stuff is.literally just moving money from one wallet to.another.

So, I know this was forever ago in internet minutes ....
But why do you say this? I mean, what is it that makes this seem so fantastical? Do you have your own theory, or does leroux just seem wrong to you? It fits his mo perfectly. It matches up to his money storage problems. It fits his timeline of being arrested. Bitcoin fits his distrust of government. Why is it so crazy that he'd be the one behind it?
Are there timeline issues? Ideology issues? Writing issues? Motivation issues?
Just curious why this is so outrageous to you for someone who has the experience, ideology, motivation , etc to do exactly something like creating Bitcoin.
E: just as a quick reminder, leroux was talking about digital currency, much like Bitcoin, in the 90s.  In the 2000s it was almost a necessity for someone like him, with houses full of cash, with nowhere to legitimately put it. So.. again.. what's so crazy about this theory?

Isn't that the sole reason they exist? They publish like 5 articles a day about how Bitcoin is about to be worth 20k, 15k, 100k, or a million in 2 years.
It's a fucking joke.

Because of its volatility? Any merchant would have to be an idiot, or a hodler to even consider it. 
You realize how small margins are in 98% of all stores? Cmon dude. 
You wanna accept a currency that swings a couple hundred bucks a day? And one that went from 20k to 4k in a year? Good luck in your small business, bud

0? Probably not. But a dollar or so? Absolutely reasonable to think that may happen

Fair. I get that. But its consistent. They know what they will pay, and what they are getting paid. Which is why lots of stores have fees for using a card. (In th us, usually 35 cents or so)
Also.. as a %.. how many bitcoin owners spend bitcoin, not just hold it? My guess... 1% or less. 
Edit: what are bitcoin fees at now? I've been out a the loop for a minute as I sold summer 2017. If I send you $10( some weird decimal of a bitcoin), what are the fees?
 As an owner, I cant look at my balance daily and have any idea how much money I have in an hour. 3 hours. 24 hours. How is that useful to me, the user? How do I plan my budget? How do I know what I can spend on groceries in a given week?
E:e: what are the delays? As  a merchant, what does that time cost? Both simply for labor/service but also potentially with price swings? Could I accept a transaction and suddenly bitcoin is worth $100 less? (Thus losing my margin, or much more, in minutes) what values is placed on immediate, flawless Visa transactions vs an unknown, only so many per minute type transaction?
Dont kid yourself..whales own unrestricted markets. Libertarian or whatever.. you have to see the dangers of unregulated markets. Just read the articles on how one bitcoin from 150 to 1000 ( yeah... not what I'm risking my business on.

Where does the idea that bitcoin is being "adopted " by anyone come from?
Bitcoins rise was due to investment. Due to people trying to get rich. Little, if anything to do with being used as an actual currency, or being "adopted" by anyone other than people hoping to hold on and make money 
Bitcoin owners that actually use if for anything is probably less than 1%.

All of this "success" with big banks and bitcoin is sort of ironic, isn't it?
Btw, when huge banks get "involved" in bitcoin, it's both speculation (as is the case with 90% of bitcoin owners), and it's making money. If your big bank will facilitate bitcoin transactions for you, they make money. It doesn't mean they think it's some kind of revolution. So much of this news in the late year is horribly misinterpreted.

My question- why would big bank participation in the market be positive?
