I created a website selling chickens and goats to farmers for bitcoin.  Each Chicken is actually only 0.005 bitcoin including shipping anywhere in North America.

Ya that is a worry for sure, but they do factor in around a -25% swing.

Thanks for the response.  I knew I'de get, "double and triple check" and buy a new keyboard.  I was thinking the 2 steph authentication doesn't solve this issue but maybe it does? I'll have to try it out.
From what I understand when sending bitcoin to my wallet I get dinged with fees each transaction, and it doesn't matter the amount of the transaction;  So lump sum transfers saves you a small amount of bitcoin.
I just wish there wasn't a "if you get it wrong, your coins are lost forever."

They should resent it! For once the average Joe can get in and have a piece of the pie!

Yes it is rough. The amount of effort needed for newcomers is simply insane.

Because money solves many real-life issues that most of us face.  Most of us are stuck in the rat race from years of stagnant salaries and increasing living costs

Very interesting.  Makes sense.

You sir, are my kind of people.  The future is going to be VERY interesting.  
Without Elon, the oil companies would’ve suppressed/bought out electric vehicles like they always did in the past, but Elon said fuuuuuuck youuuuuuu and pressed on.  The guy deserves a Nobel prize in my opinion.
