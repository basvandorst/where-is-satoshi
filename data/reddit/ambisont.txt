The cryptomarket will be closed at the end of the month in China.

The best time to buy BTC will be right before the Chinese exchanges reopen.

This small country has everything.

That's one of a possibilities for sure. It would be a reasonable act since the communists own everything.

It's my opinion, that the crucial thing is that nobody knows for how long the market will be closed. As I understand, owning cryptocurency will not be illegal. But who will risk to own a currency which you can only trade on the illegal market?

This is gonna spread like a tsunami all over the world.

You shiuldn't buy if you don't know, why the price is falling. That's what people did at 3000. The big fall is just arround the corner imo.

I'd say wait till september ends. Chinese are going to sell this weekend.

It's about the customer information before the purchase. Everything is very unclear on bitnovo. There were no hidden procedures when I was verifying my identity on  and  I'm not sure that the origin is making a role here.

Is my english so bad?

Don't be a crowd. Buy when they are shouting: "Ponzy scheme!"

At least buy some alt coins. After some years you will be grateful.

That's why you can lie down in grass and smile.
