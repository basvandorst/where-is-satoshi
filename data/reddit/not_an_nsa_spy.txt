No this wouldnt happen... Quantum computers, they aren't magical machines that break just any encryption. Special algorithms are developed to take advantage of the quantum nature of the computers. The two most well known algorithms are Shor's and Grover's. Shor's is very effective at factoring out prime numbers from encryption types like RSA. Grover's algorithm is much slower(comparatively), but it would be the one applied to SHA-256. Grover's algorithm effectively reduces the complexity of SHA-256 to SHA-128. So a doubling in key size would effectively prevent quantum computing from becoming feasible, and I would not be surprised to see a new alt-coin come out when quantum computers become scalable and available implementing SHA-512.
However, if quantum computers were able to mine bitcoins extraordinarily well, it would have a major impact. If they wanted to mine for money, they wouldn't mine all the coins. That is how friedcat of asicminer is working. If he mined so much that he had more than 51% of the whole network, the coins he mined would essentially be useless. So if the NSA or google wanted to destroy bitcoins, and quantum computers could actually mine them, yes they could mine them all very rapidly and it would be reduced to worth almost nothing. But it **is not** feasible.

Well it makes sense I think. If you make the hashing engine smaller, you can fit more engines on the same chip, no?
65nm*65nm = 4225 nm^2
28nm*28nm = 784 nm^2
We know that BFL has 16 engines per chip, so assuming maximum density: 4225*16=67600nm^2 chipsize
So for KnC, if they use the same size chip: 67600/784 = ~86 engines.
So, KnC has roughly 5* more engines per chip than BFL if the engines were the same size, which they aren't.
So assuming that the engines are also 5x smaller, KnC would have ~431 engines per chip.
431/16 = ~27
So it makes sense that KnC's miners are about 25x faster than BFL's. The 27 number doesnt quite line up with 25x faster because it's not actually possible to put the engines perfectly close together, and that estimation gets worse the smaller the space goes.
Edit: I guess I'm wrong. It was just a guess anyway.

The stuff is really interesting, i'm just not good at explaining.

The network would effectively be compromised. Nobody would trust btc and everyone would sell. So the coins they mine would be worth next to nothing.
