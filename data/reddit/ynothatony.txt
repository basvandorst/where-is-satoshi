I will be the „no“ person. Someone has to say it.

Any second now

I like when people say „an“ before an word starting with an consonant xD

Isn’t communism were everybody is equal? so in a blockchain. In communism nobody is (should be) higher than the other, like in blockchain. Isn’t blockchain all about to give the power to the people? Communism too, in theory. Blockchain opens the door to the first “real” communism without a central government, isn’t it? 
What’s your point of view? Let me know.

I just downvoted my own comment... recognized the stupidity of it.

Like that one!

You are probably wrong. Bitcoin network has a rate of ~ 10tps and it can not get higher than that. That’s about 800000btc a day.
@_date: 2019-06-08 14:42:55
That’s actually wrong...

Bitcoin is not a currency. It’s a store of value. Like Gold.

HEY! Everybody!! THIS GUY SAYS THAT THIS GUY SAYS THAT BITCOIN IS DEAD!

Some people have no access to their BTC s anymore (Lost their ledger or so), so this money is dead and not circulating 
@_date: 2019-01-28 22:44:02
That’s so damn right !!

But still, who in Simbabwe has a rooftop dish? The normal user will not get it because it’s too sophisticated.

And here we have it. If your government is corrupt enough they will shutdown your internet to make payments via bitcoin impossible

Yes, but with HODLing I would have made 3000€ or so. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:25:29
Cloud mining is a total scam! Invested 300€ before the hype and got 1500€ out. With HODLing I would have twice as much out. I would not exclude that this is just another multilevel selling scheme.

Back in 2013 I was 13 and also wanted to buy bitcoin. But back then it was way more complicated so I don’t. 2016 was the year I brought the 1st time. What I want to say is: buy! If you can then do it! You have nothing to lose. You are 14! Do it! 
@_date: 2018-12-31 11:19:00
It can go to zero

Bitcoin will care for you! I see bullish signs here
