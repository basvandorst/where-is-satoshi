Dude, you know the SERIOUS consequences of doing so? It's liking giving someone your bank debit card and access. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:18:24
It is still possible to send transactions with lower fees such as $1. It just takes more time and is pure luck . As provoost mentioned in this case, the operated took the hit. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:39:18
They publically announce their numbers. What led you to think about it ?
@_date: 2015-12-10 17:00:51
Well for high ticket items it makes sense but for low ticket items it is not incentivized. If store offers me cheaper prices for paying in Bitcoins, I might use it but unless and until that happens this would be difficult 
@_date: 2015-12-10 13:55:23
this is the case with most of the companies. By end of the day its the branding that matter and if you are able to generate network effect. If people are not paying using bitcoins for legitimate products, it's not BitPay mistake. Secondly, customers are not incentivized to pay using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 06:42:18
Have you tried calling support of the company?
If it was BitAccess, you can call on 844-248-2223 (BitAcce)
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:40:43
Well they wanted to increase awareness and though Bowl will help out. It didn't. When you have too much money in the bank, you have to spend it and you make decisions that don't make a lot of sense at time. Startups are experiments.
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:22:40
Is there a way to close your account and delete all the information linked to it ?
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:49:01
Cool - You can use BitAccess machines in most of these cities to cash out/cash in bitcoins .
Also there is a road show happening by Kryptoz Media 
@_date: 2014-05-18 23:06:36
You seems to be from Toronto. Try the bitaccess machine at Bitcoin Decentral at 64 Spadina street. Rates are better than LBC
@_date: 2014-04-14 15:47:39
It was a fake news. BitAccess.co is installing a true ATM in Dubai however this news have made some problems.
@_date: 2014-11-05 15:40:17
Its a huge step towards main stream adoptability of bitcoins. We are moving one step ahead with similar steps. Change wont happen overnight but organically :)
One more BTM by bitaccess !
@_date: 2014-07-28 06:58:11
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:33:21
Was thinking of applying for fun :)
@_date: 2014-06-20 06:56:00
These transactions fees will come down with passage of time. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 07:04:08
It takes as less as 60 seconds to receive funds
@_date: 2014-10-14 07:07:16
Cool - one more bitaccess !
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:21:07
Yes these are BitAccess BTM's 
@_date: 2014-06-20 15:48:01
It a bit of a time and effort, but we got it :)
Launching full network 
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:08:09
Amazing. Its by Bitaccess Inc. (  ) 
Way to go. One more will be launched at the same date !
@_date: 2014-08-04 06:09:54
Its coming. I can tell you this for now :)
@_date: 2014-06-28 15:49:53
^^ Great guys to work with. If you are planning to operate a machine in US, these are the right guys to work with
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:30:42
this Batch of Y-Combinator had around 7 companies focused on Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-09-02 04:06:08
There are 4 Bitaccess ATMs in Montreal. 
3485 Boulevard Saint-Laurent, Montréal, QC H2X 2T6
2150 Mt Royal Ave E, Montreal, QC, Canada
are the two locations on top of my head. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 16:34:54
I think both VOS &amp; CaVirtex are doing good job. We always try to save couple of pennies and go with a new exchange and all of sudden it got hacked/scammed etc.
Its your money, would you leave it with a reputable bank or a bank that just got opened. Have no physical location/history.
I understand this is startup world but still, CaVirtex have been for quiet a long time. Also same with Vault of Satoshi. If a company is being charged and not charging you, there is some thing fishy.
@_date: 2014-01-21 20:57:04
This Machine is manufactured by BitAccess Inc ( 
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:57:44
At BitAccess ATM, you can buy or sell, both way !
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:01:51
Most of them are installed by BitAccess. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 04:59:31
Use either of the ATM's they recently installed 
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:11:27
It verifies the telephone number using SMS
@_date: 2014-06-24 00:00:49
Both CAVirtex &amp; VOS are legit companies. She can also go to any of the ATM's . BitAccess.co have ATMs almost in every major city. 
Which city is she going to, so I can send the address of ATM in that city
@_date: 2014-06-21 02:14:15
so BitAcces will be rolling machine soon !
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:00:47

Another [BitAccess!]( !
@_date: 2014-08-14 07:48:05
It is the most simple way to buy/sell bitcoins
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:08:42
There is a capital cost involved with the ATM. It's like operating any other business. Fixed cost is the cost of machine &amp; then there are costs associated with running an ATM such as
- Operating Balance ( Cash flow for bitcoins)
- Space Lease cost
- Cash logistics cost
- Misc 
Overall it comes to approximately 30k with every thing or may be 15k if you are managing it super efficient.
After that, you will have to look into the ROI for these costs and discount the risk factor in putting money in Bitcoin Space ( Which I have my self ). I think its a long term game since its just the beginning of bitcoin. in US, financial regulations are very strict so people are more comfortable in buying bitcoin as investments rather than having a business related to that.
We have acquired licenses in few territories and it cost money and time . 
@_date: 2014-12-25 16:37:40
They have three stores in SF. Very Tasty Coconut chips ( Not sure if this is the right word ). Every one should try it !
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:13:39
 They threatened me as well for money. It was Patrick McDowell. They asked me $2500 for Huffington Post to write article on us, however I mentioned that I do not pay to Journlists for writing good things about it. They should write whatever is true. After series of threatening email, he put a review for me on a very shady website.. 
What a douche bag !
Does any one know this guy ?
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:22:15
BitAccess FTW !

[BitAccess]( machine is operating in Geneva for last 5 months 
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:20:59
Hopefully they telecast 
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:03:15
There is no finger print 
@_date: 2014-07-27 15:14:48
Expresscoin guys are legit !
I have been dealing with them and had a good response 
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:04:01
Happy for it. Bitaccess &amp; SBEX deploying network of BTMs in Switzerland
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:02:04
So there are three locations in Montreal with BitAccess ATM. Two among them are two way.
Following are the addresses that is operating at the moment.
- 2150 Av Mont-Royal Est, Montreal
Other machine is getting installed right now. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:29:30
Have you tried Have you tried Bitcoin ATMs ?
@_date: 2015-05-17 22:00:33
Fantastic Work !
@_date: 2014-08-04 06:29:47
Why dont you go to an ATM at buy one using cash.
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:04:23
Great team at bitcoinbrains !
Happy to see another [BitAccess!]( machine !
Probably the biggest gathering 
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:24:38
Volume on these machines isn't crazy like may be 10k/month so they've to make around 2k/month in revenues of which 1k may be expenses and then 1k profit. Just sharing facts around why they are super expensive. It's good for smaller purchases such as less than 1000.
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:08:59
Portable ATM is not a good idea I suppose
@_date: 2015-08-26 14:56:57
I think its a great feature !
@_date: 2015-08-10 18:13:08
Awesome. Hosting Bitcoin Meetups would be good idea but charging for them won't be a good one. You can, however, host talks like Startup Grind to make some money. You should probably advertise on Craiglist to get more visitors. Incentivizing existing users to help you bring more customers will help too. Localbitcoins is also a good resource to attract traffic
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:16:33
Even in Canada it is a requirement. If some one is operating without it, he is taking a risk.
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:29:34
Fees on this machine are the lowest one in Chicago. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:47:08
I don't believe they have the ability to do the KYC. Same thing with Skyhooks. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 21:42:37
That would be awesome if you start helping out the people to use the machine.  Restarting bitcoin meetup would be a good idea as well.
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:05:58
All the bitcoin ATMs in NY are now being ran by people who have applied for the license
@_date: 2015-07-15 03:34:04
Try the one at Ketchup Bar &amp; GoldSpike ! 
You will have a very good experience 
@_date: 2015-08-10 18:02:34
Are you looking to host one ?
Secondly, which part of the Europe are you in
Switzerland, Belgium, France, Denmark, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia are the few countries I am aware of have 2-way BTMs. They all would require a telephone #

It only happened once and the screen was replaced within days. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 01:28:05
Would be there !
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:12:57
Updating it :)
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:06:25
This is correct. BitNational have a big network of BTMS and most of them are manufactured by BitAccess. For machines that are not, they are running BitAccess software !
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:07:41
Reason why we should promote decentralized exchanges 
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:26:15
Its BitAccess machine so yes its the same one as the Henley Vaporium
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:07:52
I would go with CaVirtex..
Canada possibly have the highest density of BTM
@_date: 2015-07-18 14:42:50
In Michigan right now. It is very interesting and segregated city.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:26:17
That's the case wiht majority of the startups

This POF is provided to engage the buyers. Twitter account isn't party to any transaction but purely sharing as received 
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:12:39
Most of them do KYC and if they're not owners will be in trouble soon
@_date: 2018-03-04 15:36:15
Majority of the Bitcoin ATMS will require KYC to be performed so it's not anonymous 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:13:04
We currently do not trade ICO’s - Ethereum was an ICO 
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:09:10

There is nothing wrong with centralization but modular approach where the point of failure isn't a single party and even if one part fail, others don't get impacted much by it
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:47:45
Every one made their predictions and most of them were wild guesses. from 0 to million dollar. Now whoever guess is the closest one is cheered as guy from future but tbh they were all guesses. Crypto grew quicker than we anticipated
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:19:04
True but you've to be right at multiple times rather than one-off. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:22:11
Every one is intelligent in a bull market but funds make more money betting on the crash rather than going long. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:58:22
Not at the moment. But thanks for the offer
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:19:52
I bought some Real estate last year through bitcoin but now regret it . LOL . Gains are very nice but doesn't match crypto at all
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:01:24
It's fairly expensive to operate these so hence the 8% fees. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:00:57
Happened to me twice. Get a voip number that no one knows of
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:14:29
I really like the use case. Completing task for $$ is a service Iw ould use for sure since the audience is selective. $1 airdrops are Meh but something like $100 to a super selective group is very useful
@_date: 2019-09-30 20:36:51
They can get potentially in trouble for saying this
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:28:55
Square charged 2.9% + 30cent which is pretty standard for all the companies. 
@_date: 2019-09-30 10:57:48
Aren't these things fairly common now or is this the first one in the city. Classic robocoin machines probably running on a new software operated by coinme
@_date: 2015-09-01 14:36:43
People only accept bitcoins as mode of payment but infact its converted into Fiat immediately.

I agree. I love cash flow

TBH cost of running these is fairly expensive.

It is always sad to see a startup shut down their services. It is always tough for founders to do so. 
I didn't knew about this website, but there is a company called purse.io which looks pretty promising. 20% discount on amazon looks like a good deal.
@_date: 2015-04-07 00:11:04
Depending on your location, you might find a Bitcoin ATM nearby. I consider that to be fastest and convenient way to buy/sell bitcoins. There are, however, significant higher fees as opposed to CB &amp; Circle

@_date: 2015-09-01 15:25:37
If you consider Bitcoin as a payment mechanism, then you are correct but people consider bitcoin mostly as value instrument in which case conversion happens. Paying with CC, people pay the exact amount that they merchant is receiving. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 22:01:08
I am not sure TBH. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:47:50
Many of the Bitcoin ATMs are ran by individual owners/groups and have not a lot to do with the manufacturer itself.
@_date: 2015-10-27 17:31:24
Good work guys !
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:30:00
Have you tried any bitcoin ATM ?
@_date: 2015-10-26 15:13:12
Who absorbs the cost of transaction when it comes to CC ?
@_date: 2015-02-24 00:06:40
There are many..
Which city are you in ?
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:28:20

Excited for the machine !

There would be a Bitcoin section in CES2014 with around 6-12 companies in this space. I probably will join with an ATM Machine

You need to verify your identity by putting a code sent to your mobile phone
