How to lose money^
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:42:31
Makes more sense than all the people that say 'buy the dip' when it drops 300 usd.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:29:37
Blood would be a drop back to 5k levels
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:36:44
My god you wernt joking
@_date: 2019-07-28 16:02:58
Are you a bot or what
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:49:52
Because this is barely a dip. Yet people like you like to panic and tell others to buy in the hopes you stop losing more money. Buying every 300 drop will give you a pretty shitty dca. 
Besides that, what kind of advice is 'maintaining discipline' and 'putting money where your mouth is' ? Id rather adjust my plans based on the trend/price action, which seems to be down in my eyes. 
I indeed said I will wait for below 5k to re-enter, how is that fud? I'm not naive enough to think my little reddit comment will affect the prices.
Edit: and if you want to go through my post history atleast read the entire thing. The dude in your link took out a loan to buy btc. So yea, going long with a x would have been a better option for him instead of taking a loan.
@_date: 2019-07-13 20:58:00
Why would anyone listen to someone whos down 40%
@_date: 2019-07-24 01:18:24
Try not to get to emotional. What part shows I dont understand the concept of dca? Seems you're the one that needs to do some googling since you're telling people to pickup a whole bitcoin after a 300 drop. Do that 3 times and most people are done 'dca-ing'
And why exactly should I be panicking? I'm not holding anything. Made nice profits on the way up and will re-enter when the price is low again.
Couldnt get myself to read the rest of your shit sadly.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:40:16
My god you're stupid. I'm not telling you to buy bitcoin, I'm telling you to act based on your predictions. Aka sell or short BTC if you're that certain instead of telling others to do so.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:05:49
BTC and alts move together. Trading bots cause that, not 'whales'
Edit: knew I saw his name before.. either a troll or beyond stupid: 
@_date: 2019-07-31 09:53:25
Maybe he did?..
@_date: 2019-07-24 11:51:30
I believe they bought around ath and lost all kindz of gainz lmao. They stopped making vids, assume they sold at 4k
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:39:33
Cant wait to buy back in at 5k
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:56:22
Nice story, except a 50k btc dump wont bring btc to 0. We've had such dumps before last year.
@_date: 2019-07-17 08:57:49
Why don't you just go long with 2-5x leverage ? Why take a loan now when btc is already up 250%? Way to much risk imo.
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:44:08

You know your strategy is weak when you start listening/quoting to 4chan
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:15:02
Probably. Seems like 'bad news' is used as a cover-up for whales to manip the price. It has dumped to many times on bad/neutral news that everyone expected and then the newspapers say the market reacted on the bad news.
@_date: 2019-07-04 23:17:09
This has to be one of the better comments ive seen on this sub.

Talking about your weak TA attempt
@_date: 2018-09-28 06:43:42
Lawsuit? For what? Coinbase is a broker, they sell the btc. Ofcourse they want a profit. Cb pro is an exchange, you buy from other people.
@_date: 2018-09-01 16:57:47
Cb TA lol
@_date: 2018-09-27 19:32:16
5 action figures
@_date: 2018-09-28 06:49:23
Still wrong. Something can be awesome without there being a demand for it. Same with people thinking the price cant go below current mining cost, also bullshit.
@_date: 2018-09-28 11:53:44
Stopped reading halfway. Keep talking shit like GUARANTEED PRICE INCREASE like some bitconnect fanboy. Nothing is guaranteed in crypto.

@_date: 2019-07-01 19:11:27
So you decided to buy at 20k but not at 3k? Could have made your entry price alot lower and actually be in the green now.
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:27:25

Early adopters wernt always early. If you did some research you'd know that even people that paid below 100 dollars per btc had a rough time at some point. Your whiny post just shows weak hands. It also starts to annoy how people like you point out a 15% drop right after a 40% increase. If you can't handle the market, sell your coins, take the losses and piss off m8
@_date: 2018-05-26 08:01:48
And like I said, it doesnt keep me busy. Go doom and gloom all you like.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:44:36

@_date: 2018-08-23 07:23:18
Thats not how it works lmao
@_date: 2018-08-29 10:36:08
Not even close to being a bull market
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:07:44
I see you lack basic reading skills. The part you quote was part of an if statement. Or did you just confirm you can't handle the market by feeling offended ? In that case it would indeed be wise to stop investing. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:54:11
With that theory we'll never reach a bottom
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:51:32
Now we're getting somewhere
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:41:48
Difficulty increases and decreases with the amount of people mining
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:45:13
Can't blame them, it's kinda retarded to say the price will never go below 8k again. We've bounced to 12k before y'know?
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:55:32
Then what?
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:31:43
You really don't get it do you lmao
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:26:09
Its watching us
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:36:13
Holy shit these posts get tiresome. You kids really want to call people out on every dip just so that they can call you out once the price goes up again? Grow up
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:49:03
Shameless self promoting. Insta block.

@_date: 2018-05-17 10:26:23
Do you get paid promoting that shit or something? Pretty much every comment is about localbtc

@_date: 2018-08-14 12:53:14
You're telling me we don't need lambo's in space?
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:12:36

@_date: 2018-05-05 11:42:10
This guy knows how it works /s
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:45:08
Ofcourse, it's actually good news for btc
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:20:42
You've been sitting on the toilet for too long
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:53:32
I'm convinced. My whole life was a lie
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:03:48

Noone knows if tether is backed by usd but it doesnt keep me busy. Not much we can do about it anyway.
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:00:37
Yeah that must be it. Going up 1k in few days without small correction is not normal.

Congratz, you're the first retard of the day

So how much did you lose?
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:39:38
And do they have the same POW as btc? The same level of safety? Or are you one of those Verge investors that gets rekt by 51% attacks? No thanks.

@_date: 2018-05-29 13:40:01
Same here, I actually walked up to my colleagues to tell them since pretty much everyone here has some sort of crypto
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:17:12

@_date: 2018-08-29 12:26:37
@_date: 2018-05-09 09:53:39
Think he ment support
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:54:08
Depends on when you bought it. You can just sell if you bought recently. If you bought in december and don't want to lose money id suggest holding on to it.
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:14:18
Because alts also dropped harder.
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:11:23
I think people need to stop looking at 5\-15mins chart all day
@_date: 2018-08-01 08:13:07
BTC is just going back a little to pick up the forgotten alts, nothing to worry :)
@_date: 2018-08-25 09:53:17
In that case every alt is dieing. Also ltc/eth
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:16:41
Good boi
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:28:34
Probably. Everyone is expecting institutional buyers to just press the buy button and a massive green dildo appears. Ofcourse not, they will pump/dump and short btc until they got what they want from the newbies.
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:42:50
I bet you'd write great books

@_date: 2018-05-20 10:09:41
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:37:50
We went up too much and too fast last year. Easy as that.
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:17:55
I keep seeing the same arguments. Scarcity and electricity costs. This doesn't guarantee a high BTC price. I'm surprised even McAfee used the increased electricity cost as an argument for higher BTC prices.
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:33:03
No, the oposite. Just because it went up the day after does not mean it's out of the downwards trend yet. Might as well drop 300 tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 06:55:20
No its not. Its the bad day trading youre doing thats fucking you over

@_date: 2018-05-28 10:13:12
Just did. Now we wait, still got some on sidelines for if we see higher lows.
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:27:08
Coinbase is easy for beginners. Transfer money there but don't buy your bitcoins from Coinbase. Use their exchange called GDAX (will be Coinbase Pro in the future). That way you don't pay extra broker fees. Theres plenty of videos out there, just search for 'coinbase no fees' on youtube.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:24:50
You can make loads shorting 
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:23:31
Untill it goes to 5k and you start to panic
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:06:14

Bitcoin is alive.
@_date: 2018-05-06 01:06:01
The fork doesnt give free money. The new bcash replaces tbe old one. The old one will be useless and worthless. Miners will stop mining the old ones.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:14:37
Just speaking for myself, but when I see BTC below 7k I only think of buying instead of panic selling
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:26:03

Price has gone up just now. Try selling a portion.
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:37:43
Yeah because even when I know everything about crypto's I still keep entering bitcoin in Google. Get real, everyone knows what bitcoins are nowadays. Theres no need to Google anymore.
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:18:36
You have no idea what you're talking about, do you?
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:37:01
It's your own choice to be manipulated though. And judging by all the panic posts I'd say they're doing an excellent job.

@_date: 2018-06-25 16:06:58
It's buying/selling around 6,3usd worth of btc, with 0.25% fee, thats 0.001575 usd per trade. It's doing around 15 trades per second by the looks of it ? Should be around 0.20 to 0.25 cents lost per second. Around 14 usd per minute and 850 per hour.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:35:53
How is noone using btc? What uses do you think it has? Maybe btc doesn't seem much for people using the EUR/USD but what about country's with inflated currencies like Venezuela ? Theres alot more to btc than your local candyshop accepting btc.

Pumps and dumps or not, the daily chart is starting to look quite nice
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:56:26
With long/shorts you can make twice the profit you would make with just holding and waiting to moon. You don't 'win' from the house, you're betting against other people. 
Just like the december boom, some people made money on the way up, then shorted it and made money on the way down.

Also watching the shorts increase the past few days. This is what we need for a nice little spike soon.
@_date: 2018-06-18 10:12:43
So people stop mining. Mining difficulty decreases, people profit again with lower overhead. People need to stop thinking the price can't drop below the currect production/mining cost.
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:30:20

@_date: 2019-10-23 12:18:10
Agreed, sideways at 6500 range until it goes even lower. Probably 5k levels. I'm not buying until then.

@_date: 2019-10-05 22:32:02
I've been wondering the same thing and I guessed it had to do with people following a strict DCA schedule and only buying on their payday. 
It's not just bitcoin though, I see people irl with this sort of attitude all the time. People waiting for birthday money or holiday money (is that a thing in different countries?) etc etc before buying something they want.
Just a few weeks ago my neighbour thought we wouldnt be able to go on a holiday because I had to spend around €1500 on my car. As if I'm not prepared for a situation like that..
Really makes you wonder what the financial situation of some people is.
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:35:30
Quite minimal, the 'bear flag' you mentioned earlier was the result of that hack. The second they announced the hack the market had a (small) drop. Trying to TA it makes no sense.

This thread is mainly memes and amateur price predictions based on emotions and hunches. The few people you see spamming here don't represent the thousands of people that hold Bitcoins. You shouldn't take things said in this thread so serious. That being said, my amateur advice would be to atleast set some stop orders incase things go south.

Honestly doubt G20 will spend much attention on crypto's (as they already stated). (I guess that's somewhat positive) I don't expect much else coming from the summit.
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:32:20
1. Create an account on Coinbase. Get verified (submit ID, etc). Secure your account, setup 2 factor login etc.
2. Use SEPA deposit to put money from your bank to your Coinbase account (No costs)
3. Don't buy anything from Coinbase, they are just a broker and will charge fees for buying/selling. Instead go to GDAX, also owned by Coinbase. It uses the same login details.
4. In GDAX, deposit money from your Coinbase account. I suggest watching a video how to do so.
5. Start trading. Look up on the maker/taker fees to ensure you trade with no costs.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:41:45

I've had the same feeling, thinking it would be double/triple pump + massive dump but nothing has happend yet. After every pump there seems to be growing support. I shorted after the first pump, rebought yesterday and set a pretty strict stop loss. Time will tell.

Even if it gets hacked, they keep over 90% of the coins in cold storage. Even if 100% was stolen, it would probably still stay above 1k

You want to do a one time deposit of 30 euro into BTC and withdraw 5 every week while the 30 euro stays the same? Thats a 15% increase every week. Doubt that's going to happen.
Besides that, if every cent counts, don't invest in crypto's because you might as well be losing 5 buks a week.

Just looking at the rsi you can tell we really are in the oversold area. That alone should give good odds of the price going up. Besides that, lately weve seen alot of pumps before dumping again. No way im selling at this point.

No idea what you're getting at. The person to take the order will have to pay the fee. If you sell for that 1 cent less, you lose the 17 cents + 300 buks on fees, because you are the taker. The maker in this case, aka the buyer, doesnt pay fees.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:36:32
I can sell it for 500

Young guy..You're fucking 27 y/o. I believe even Coinbase has an app where you can straight up buy BTC. Getting 'approved' on an exchange is not harder than setting up a regular bank account. I think the 'I am very lazy' is the only problem here. Next to that, posting this shit everywhere because it took you a really long time (what, 15mins?) to write doesn't make sense and only proves how lazy you indeed are.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:23:32
I believe many people here actually bought in higher than the current price. Theyre not spoiled but either scared or losing hope.

Big resistance points often become support once the price goes through it. Like how 9k is holding support in the past few days.

Maker/taker fees?
Did the math for you, it's almost 300 bucks to buy 16 btc at the sellers price, that's why. (Gdax, 0.25% fee)
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:42:38
Well with 4500 cash on you you'd think you wouldnt go alone. Or bring a gun, its usa right? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:08:56
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:46:39
And then 
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:34:27
Ask yourself this, why did you think it would drop to 5.5k - 6k? My guess is you read it somewhere on the bitcoin megathread. Problem with the people there is, they are in the same position as you. They sell at the bottom and then panic post fud on reddit with the hopes it keeps going down, allowing them to buy in at a better position. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:57:55
Did you buy yet? Or still waiting for 4k

So because theres only 1 Mona Lisa, the price is capped?
@_date: 2018-04-23 21:51:48
One is a broker, that buys BTC below market price and sells it above market price. The other is an exchange, where you can buy from others without fees. You can deposit directly into GDAX, no 'need' of Coinbase. aka Coinbase = shit, GDAX is pretty good. It's cool if you want to give additional info, but atleast make sure it's correct.
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:57:43

@_date: 2018-04-30 19:46:53
Don't worry.

His entire comment history is about spamming pump and dump. Doubt this dude has any idea whats going on. Honestly, crypto's are better off without people like this.

@_date: 2018-04-12 22:43:11
Thats the 1 cent difference you mentioned. If there is a sell order for 8k, you can't buy for 8k without paying the fees. You place an order for 7999.99 and wait till someone sells it to you.
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:16:55

How does shorting create buying pressure? When price drops, long positions on Bitmex get liquidated. GDAX doesn't have that problem. 
I'm not denying that GDAX drops harder than Bitmex, your reasoning just seems weird.
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:11:10
Check what date it is lol
@_date: 2018-04-29 22:14:05

Lets see where it goes next

Well seems like someone watched his first TA video
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:40:56
I actually think it's amazing how well these dumps get absorbed. Really different than a few days/weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:26:02
Probably 9k before the end of this week
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:51:08
If you mean that 123abc guy, I already called him out and he deleted the comment lol. 
His short was something about potential 40% gain vs 5.8% risk. I guess he took that 5.8% good and hard.

Wtf goin on
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:10:37
I said it before and I'll say it again, selling now is the same as buying at 20k.
