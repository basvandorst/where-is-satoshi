"Bit Coins"
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:52:33
Yeah, people tend to be scared and reserved about it things if they don't understand them. When I first told my dad about Bitcoin his immediate reaction was hostile and that it was a fraudulent ponzi scheme traded by "people like you [who don't really understand how money works]". Two months down the line and he's actively keeping up with news, sees it as a potential store of value and we discuss it regularly.  Give it enough time and the bitcoin community will grow from a couple of hundred thousand to a few million to tens of millions. Then governments might start to take it seriously.

Guide to Get Bitcoin:
* Mine them
* Trade with them on exchanges like MtGOX, Kraken, etc.
* Steal them (illegal sometimes)
* Sell someone something for them, like a service or product
* Get donated them, but don't beg like a scrub or I'll come for you
* Get a big piece of paper with an address QR code on it and be seen in the background on a major TV network
I think that's sort of it

I meant it in terms of when thefts occur and the police doesn't/can't do anything about it. [There was a case in Australia]( in which someone had a large quantity of bitcoins stolen and didn't report it seeing as BTC transactions are near impossible to trace. Its (to me) a situation in which the law doesn't quite cover it because either bitcoins were too new a thing for governments and the law to take seriously, or because its so difficult to do anything about it.

As do I! We should start an MtG trading site that only uses BTC. I'm sure a good portion of MtG players know what BTC are.

MT Gox is the only website I know of that doesn't let you use a bank statement as proof of residency. Strangely, they won't accept neither my paper half of my driving license or the plastic card itself (UK Resident here) as proof of address either, despite being from a government office and having my address on them. I'm in a similar situation to you, OP, in which all the de facto forms of proof listed by Mt Gox are unavailable to me - I'm tempted to attempt to photoshop a scan of something to have my name on it.

Bloody hell. I don't know if I should go short or long on BTC.

Money that went around back when there was a gold standard was "backed by gold" - that meaning, any paper bill or coin had some value equivalent in gold, and the value of gold set the buying power of the money. Fiat currency is much like what we have today - the currency isn't backed by anything save for trust between a buyer and a seller.

I had a similar conversation with my dad. He says that bitcoins are a Ponzi scheme and that people trade them for the sole reason that they think that can make money off of it - and this is someone not too unlike Schiff who has worked in the city for most of his career. In my honest opinion, people such as he and Schiff don't understand it because it is a very new idea that you can't easily describe using existing models - at least, not soon-to-be-19 me whose understanding of the economy began about a year ago. 
I think Bitcoin is a bubble, though. Just in the same way practically every currency in the world is a bubble. Bubbles only 'burst' when most people decide that whatever made up the bubble has no value. The USD 'bubble' would burst if everyone in the US decided that the dollar was totally worthless (spoilers: it is) and refused to trade anything for them. The same can happen to bitcoin, although its extremely unlikely. 
I think Schiff's real issue is that he doesn't understand what backs the Bitcoin. Why people trade it, why people see value in it. It's the argument my dad put forward - there's nothing backing the Bitcoin, no government, no central back, no country with a GDP. I think that's where Peter is coming from.

Coinfloor is completely new, and they did say that they were accepting registrations and such a week in advance to trading opening to give people an opportunity to sign up and get ready. 
I signed up with Kraken the other day, all my verification and stuff was sorted within an hour of my signup. Coinfloor is something of an exception because it is so new.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:41:52
Ah right, gotcha. Thanks.

How is virtual money different from printed money, aside from the fact that you can physically hold a dollar and not a bitcoin? Both of them have value, so both of them can buy things. That's what money is for - it provides a means of trading value when commodities aren't available. In fact, you can in theory have a bitcoin "note" - you can set up a wallet, print out its QR code and give it to someone. That note is something like a dollar bill would have been under a gold standard - it represents a value in some other commodity whose buying power is determined by the value of said commodity. In the old days, one dollar could buy you different amounts of things depending on how much that dollar was worth in gold. Today, one bitcoin "note" can buy you different amounts of things depending on the value of a bitcoin in dollars. Eventually, when paper currency dies out, everything will have a value in bitcoin or whichever virtual currency comes to replace it. The end product is money still does the same job regardless of which form it is in. If you want to buy off a senator's vote to war, it doesn't matter if you use gold, dollars, or bitcoins. As long as you grant them enough "buying power", regardless of what form its in, they've become richer and will vote for it.

I'm trying to get my MTGox verification through now, is it ever worth attempting to open a Japanese bank account? I really have no idea of the law on this, but trying to learn more. Seeing as I live in the UK, would it be a better idea for me to stick with local currencies and exchanges (localbitcoins, Coinfloor when it opens, Kraken?) for the sake of avoiding wiring fees? Thanks
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:19:05
This makes sense. Although, I have a widget on my Android (Bitcoinium) that tracks prices on various exchanges, and it seems that MTGox is constantly trading at roughly $20-30 more than Kraken, constant enough that it seems safe bet. So far the volumes of BTC I'm dealing with are so small they often only want 5-6 confirmations before going through, do these increase as the volume of BTC increases?
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:15:03
Can you explain what this means? All I understood of that is that high USD rates mean bad things for withdrawal.
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:55:03
Ah, I transferred my existing BTC into Kraken. It took about 10 minutes for the confirmations to come through. Either way, Kraken has at any one point maybe 0.5% the volume that MTGox has, so I'll be interested to see how Coinfloor does.
