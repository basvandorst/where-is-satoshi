No, no, here's the thing, Reddit's been around for a lot longer than you have been on Reddit. The only people who get paid on Reddit is the Admins, who make, develop and do their actual jobs at Reddit. But Moderators do not get paid, I don't know how to say this to you, but if you expect to be paid for moderating what basically is a forum, then you should not be a moderator.

Just worked it out for my "up to" speed, it would take me 97.0903704 days. Yay for having 4Mb/s internet.

Look at major subreddits I doubt any of them get paid, they can't get paid without donations, and I don't think they ask for donations. Those subreddits do quality work and so does this one, all for free.

When Gigabit internet comes to my house soon, it will only take 9.10222222 hours. However my ISP is rubbish at installing fiber so it's a long rollout switching from copper to fiber.

Hey! That's my subreddit!
It's a bit redundant seeing as there's @_date: 2014-05-23 21:32:50
I doubt it's a paid position, I believe that most, if not all, moderators just do it for fun in their own time.

I'm not saying it doesn't, but what I am saying is that this is how we do it on Reddit, the only incentive is to make the community a better place.

In the UK we use the term waiter, so this person might also be from the UK.

Cannot say this enough, Newsweek are absolutely terrible, and Leah McGrath Goodman is worse. Recently she published an article about Jersey, Channel Islands, UK.
One of her interviewees was a woman called Shona Pitman, recently they have been laughed at by the whole island for blowing a joke way out of proportion and trying to sue a couple of companies, they are now bankrupt and have no respect.
I don't know why anyone would read Newsweek unless they go to have a bit of a giggle.

Yeah, i've also just got the email, so it's most likely Circle's fault.
