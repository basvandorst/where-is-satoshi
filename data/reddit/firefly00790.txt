Hey everyone, I'm just a kid with some questions, and I've found out a few things trying to do some people would think "unethical things".
I have lost a lil bitcoin, and only learned from it, but I am finding out there are lot of different legal ways to make bitcoin and money locally.
I just wondered if there was anyone that would like to mentor me, because I have lots of time on the pc, or if anyone has any ideas of what to do first, like here is my first tid bit of info.
Like those big packs of thousands of downloads you buy from the d nets, lots of it on those guides or whatever, are just really easy stuff you can find on the internet if you know how to search it.
So going on the d nets and trying to find stuff like that, trying to learn new info is not going to work very well for you. All simple information..
But anyways, hope to talk with some of you more, Take care, GOD SPEED EVERYONE!
