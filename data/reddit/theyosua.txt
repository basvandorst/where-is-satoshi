They are known even outside of Japan too. This is great validation for the tech.

That is very doable actually. Verge raised US$3m to be accepted by pornsites amirite!

Where's the cc in it? Those coins were not minted bitcoin or anything

OP why don’t you quote some here for our benefit :)

And then completely miss the rally when it pushes past yesterday's ATH. $8,800 now, could have had more money in your pocket... This is why we hodl.

I bought around $5,000 in Oct 2017 :) Sold some at $15k. Even $7.6k was still a cushy 50% profit for me. But that's beside the point. You can't win in crypto if you shy from dips.

So these days people pull out if something doesn't make them money within, what...24 hours? Then bitch about it on reddit. Wow.

Instead of satoshis we can start pricing alts at Lemonades

Oi neighbour! Yeah % wise definitely not a huge amount. I believe adoption would be on a whole other level if the January correction had not been so harsh. I'm in the startup community, and there was much excited chatter around December about adoption which has quietened down now.
At the end of the day bitcoin is synonymous with crypto for the general public. Regardless what your favourite coin is, I think the whole cc community should support Bitcoin and not try to bring it down cos it will accelerate the adoption of everything else as well.

I don't know which country you live in OP, but I can actually spend Bitcoin to get shit (beer, food, gym supp's etc) here in Australia. And remember how Steam adopted bitcoin too? That would be back on the table soon.
Also currencies like Stellar still talking about creating cash out terminals (fancy words for ATMs) but Bitcoin ATMs are already all over the place. 
BTC IS the most widely adopted crypto.

Positive sentiment has been cooking for a while. Approaching boiling point now.

Inertia. Any changes, no matter how good/beneficial, will face resistance because change takes effort. Businesses may be thinking about accepting bitcoin, but it would require them to 1. Learn about wallets and other technicals 2. Make the concious/work to implement 3. Mentally accept the 'risks' as they perceive it. Square implementing it accross their network could make it really easy to make the decision and accelerate adoption. Also a bigger entity condoning it would validates the tech for smaller entities.

Yes. Would make that bet too.
