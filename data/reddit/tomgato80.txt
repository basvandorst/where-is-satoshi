I'm in it because I am outraged at big tech companies for harvesting our data. I'm tired of government and banks manipulating interest rates and devaluing my savings through inflation. I'm tired of bankers asking me where and why I am sending my money, and profiting from the absurd fees that they charge me for their lackluster service.
I don't want another centralized payment vehicle like PayPal. Look what the Patriot Act did with services like PayPal and Neteller. They are centralized entities and can therefore be controlled by government and big money.
If what you say is true....I hope the market dumps so we can shake out the weak hands who are only here for profits.

You had my attention until you said altcoins.

But when you look at current events with Congress and comments from the Federal reserve.....you see just how much of an effect US law has on the Bitcoin price.
The need to not only track every single purchase, but to also need a timestamp so I can calculate my capital gains tax based on the Bitcoin price at the time of my coffee purchase is a deal breaker for me. It defeats the purpose of privacy and adds an inconvenience.
It's easier to store money in Bitcoin and cash into Fiat on an as needed basis.
@_date: 2019-07-29 12:08:37
Need to change the tax code. Nobody wants to calculate capital gains tax on the purchase of a cup of coffee.

And the stock market always goes up. It's a gamblers fallacy.
It's great to see analytical data from people trained in the field of predictive modeling.......not so much from Twitter mobs dreaming about alt season and Lambo's.

It's the internet. You have millions of misinformed people who have no clue what they're talking about who that will present themselves as experts.

Is that really all you're here for?
Not for decentralization from government.....banks....... corporations?
That kind of goes back to my original sentiment. It saddens me to see that a large portion of the community care more about enriching themselves gambling nonnpenny stocks than they do about the cause.

It's cheaper to buy a pre paid Visa card.
The market is going to choose a pre paid Visa card if $100 gets you $90 in Bitcoin.
These operators are price gouging to make up for the lack of volume.
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:35:59
10% mark-up
These vultures hurt Bitcoin adoption more than they help it.
@_date: 2019-08-26 01:44:16
That doesn't mean they are profitable. People speculate on business all of the time.
At 20% markup costs they don't need many people to use them. In fact I'd argue that if people actually used them, they wouldn't need to price gouge with 20% fees.
My point remains......the machine is highly unlikely to contain the riches that the thieves were hoping to find. Nobody is dumb enough to stock an unsupervised machine full of cash when nobody even uses the machine. Best case scenario the machine has 5k USD in it.
@_date: 2019-08-24 21:46:11
The real question is why would you want to own an inflationary currency controlled by greedy bankers and politicians seeking to inflate away their defecits?
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:20:32
Little do these guys know that nobody uses BTM's because the fees are ass rape.

That dump though.......no way Bakkt can compete with the ability to dump the price like CME and their paper coins.

Corporate coin?
So Bitcoin is now about businesses making money?
My credit card works just fine for that....thanks but no thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:12:55
I don't disagree with anyone leaving for a coin that better fits them......my problem is with the attempted Corporate takeover of the Bitcoin name.
Bitmain only selling their mining rigs for their preferred currency is shady. It was shady when coal mines paid their employees in their own currency which was only accepted in their stores. That is not a free market in fact that type of abuse is what leads to centralization.......to the need for government involvement.
Roger Very owning the Bitcoin.com domain and using to push BCH........shady as hell. Again the type of crap that pushes us right into the arms of big government.
Roger Very and Craig Wright hanging with billionaire Bodog fugitive Calvin Ayre, and Calvin bragging on Facebook that BCH is going to overtake Bitcoin..........Shady as all hell.
Go start Bodog coin...... 
 I would rather do business with the government if this is what Bitcoin is to become.
Seems to me like some think the whole Bitcoin thing is just a big ass ICO for the latest and greatest PayPal.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:34:03
So it is basically PayPal part deux.
Are these businesses going to back my funds like my bank does? 
Are they going to stand up for my privacy when the IRS comes knocking?
Corporate coin sounds a lot like what I already have minus protections that are afforded to me by banks and federal government.

But with the opportunity to hit the big 'middle' where both bets win. It all would come down to the probability of successfully winning non both.
If you buy at an average of $9k and pump the market to $10k....you could have been short at $8k.......dump at $10k and generate enough steam from others selling off of your dump to win both bets.
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:58:37
Not really. If you go short in the future market and have enough BTC to dump the market you're guaranteed to win one of your bets and worst case scenario break even. After settlement you can go short again......buy back your BTC.......pump the price again.......and then dump again 30 days later.
This has been going on with CME ever since it was introduced and the pump before that was the big boys loading up in anticipation of this.
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:52:23
Because if you hammer the price down in cash settled markets it doesn't put any upward pressure on the price of Bitcoin.
The price difference in the markets creates an arbitrage opportunity and bots will hammer both sides until the markets meet in the middle and their is no arbitrage opportunity remaining.
@_date: 2019-04-28 00:39:29
That's how we know that someone like Bernie Sanders could never be Satoshi. Socialists can't redistribute wealth if they can't access it. Bitcoin is anti socialism by design.
@_date: 2019-04-27 22:32:42
Bernie needs you on the USD so he can redistribute your wealth.
@_date: 2019-04-27 22:50:32
I don't have much wealth either but Bernie Sanders will not be gaining access to my Bitcoin wallet.

How do I delete ABC from my machine without deleting Bitcoin core?
I do not want to support BCH, but I want to run a full node for the real Bitcoin.
I currently have Bitcoin Armory installed and do not want to delete the entire core database.
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:56:34
Interesting read indeed. That article was written in March 2017, I wonder at what point in time and for what reason Wright and Ayre decided to abandon Bitcoin and create BCH. This stinks to high hell.
The real Jesus would not break bread with Calvin Ayre. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:06:34
This man is  and never will be a member of any Bitcoin community. Calvin Ayre is a CEO who likely has a huge position in BCH and will try to use Bodog and his influence in offshore gambling to make BCH the preferred crypto in offshore gambling.
They are trying to force BCH adoption. Bitmain only accepting BCH for mining rig purchases and now trying to convert offshore gambling operations to move to BCH.

Would you still be a fan of Libra if Mark Zuckerberg were replaced with Donald Trump?

Anything more than a pocket full of gold is a death sentence if the power grid goes down. 98% of goldbugs would get punched in the stomach and have their gold taken from them without even putting up a fight.

Can I use Libra if I own a gun? Or will Mark Zuckerberg ban me?

The point is that once your holdings of gold surpass the ability to fit inside of your pocket it becomes increasingly more difficult for you to hide how much gold you have.

Calvin Ayre got his start in shady insider trading deals where he was ordered by a court to stay away from stock exchanges for 20 years. Next in life he was involved in drug smuggling where he ultimately snitched on his crew and ran off with the money and started Bodog. A poster on gambling chat forums by the name of Paddy was the pilot who got busted smuggling when Ayre snitched, Paddy has dedicated his life to exposing Ayre for the crook he is (chat forums such as  Major Wager, Peeps Place, and The RX).
Bodog is known as a loser only sportsbook where winning sharp players are shown the door. They are also well known for partaking in an act known as dealing dual lines, this is where they move the line on an event 1/2 point from market price in the books favor and sharp players who bet the profitable side of the bet are profiled and eventually dealt a different line.
Needless to say Calvin Ayre is a shady ass one way motherfucker who is always out for himself. Anything he is associated with is shady as fuck. I was no fan of BCH before but now I know 100% beyond doubt that I want no parts of it.
Watch for price manipulation with this sleazeball involved.

In a world where websites like 8chan can be shutdown by political correctness, I certainly don't want a group of Facebook political activists to have the ability to decide the fate of my business.
Libra is the polar opposite of what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is permissionless.......Libra will be far from that.
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:52:17
Sorry I misread your original post.
I just want people to think about that. If you aren't okay with Trump Coin.....you shouldn't be okay with Zuckerberg coin.

Not buying Bitcoin is not an investment.
@_date: 2019-05-29 19:59:37
You can buy fractions of a Bitcoin.
The idea that you suggest that buying shitcoins is somehow cheaper tells me that you should probably do some research before you invest any further. Buying shitcoins from the position your in right now is like a degenerate gambler chasing bad bets.
