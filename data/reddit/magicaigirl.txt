I have my calculations adjusted. Now the numbers look more reasonable but still very radical. $300,000 per coin is a must to make it a business. That does not tell anything good for bitcoin future from my perspective. Who knows tho.

Back in 2012 I had around $50,000 and I heard something vague about bitcoin. So I invested my $50,000 in booze and some random stuff people usually buy.
Back in 2015 I found myself very curious about bitcoin and studied it. So I invested $10 in bitcoin.
These days I was about to invest in anything that will help me to kill myself for my 2012, but eventually I realised that many people are still in the same state of my 2012 and my 2015.

@_date: 2018-01-25 21:26:46
I am not an economist and I am struggling to understand you. Let me put it how I understand it, so maybe you will have easier time explaining it to me:
hypothetically speaking if all crypto worth of 500 billions usd will be sold now in one country. Their demand of fiat supply will increase by 500 billions of usd. And increased fiat supply will cause prices increase. 
But what about if I buy bitcoin in my country? Maybe that is what you mean, it will cause fiat of my country to inflate. And what about if I buy bitcoin on foreign exchange? That will cause deflation, right? Because my local fiat wont be in my hands anymore, therefore bank wont need to print as much new money?
It's still far from being clear to me.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:33:55
after all coins mined from the perspective I see now the price should not ever drop below $180,000. Even below $200,000. However I may be wrong and a lot of things may also change in the future.

um, however if we take into account also other expenses and at some kind of a salary miners would not survive by transaction fees only at current price. Block reward helps. Also it looks like, that miners are forced to sell a lot, a lot of mined bitcoins.

Yep. Just drop prices for a while. No matter how big tether will be. Japanese economy expected to be boosted in 2018 because of cryptos adoption, they buy buildings with bitcoin, their largest bank is about to open their own crypto exchange with their own coin pegged to yen. 
Yet they give 0 fucks about today' tether state. It may become a threat in a distant future, so they want to replace it with their yen coin. In time.
So tether collapse may bring a dip and no more.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:51:11
I dont really understand. It cause your local fiat to inflate only if you sell bitcoins for your local fiat, not buy, right?
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:49:08
They just dont want money of their countries to flow into something so volative and they may want to implement some kind of limits on how much crypto an individual can buy. At least at the exchanges they can control.

Lets define success first? is it top 10? or top 50? or top 100?
If after bitcoin creation up until now there are/were around 3000 coins/tokens,  some died, some were plain shit from the beggining, some just born. Then for top 10 it will be 0.33% is successful. For top 50 it will be 1.97% is successful. For top 100 it will be 3.95% is successful. But thats for today.
Projects like eth, neo and eos (in an observable future) may have times and times more successful token software that may fit into top 100. Also I think that some day not only goverments, but these blockchain platforms will warn investors about scam tokens, because their reputation will be at stake.
I still think that today is yet the time when blockchain technology is too new, and almost every seriously looking project will give a massive return after many years.

Bitcoin/blockchain is as secure as much you are a cyber security expert. For example, I am not one of them. I am not sure if my wallet is secure on my win10 desktop with my router, with my gf google searches. And there is no responsible authority to refund me my loss if something goes wrong. Many other people are like me and because of it adoption is slower. Blockchain itself is trustless and has no responsibility, blockchain forces you to be your own insurance. 
Also, entry level to fully understand financial security risks of blockchain tech if you are not a programmer and economist is really fucking high. 


Very true. Cryptocurrency market as a whole has ridiculous inflation rates.


Sounds like you expect it very soon. Imo adoption of blockchain starts from bitcoin and not other crypto yet. And to change that with for example Dogecoin it needs a crazy amount of not only money but also time. So, imo every altcoin holder should support bitcoin too because of that. Every altcoin benefits from bitcoin popularity and adoption. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:34:25
