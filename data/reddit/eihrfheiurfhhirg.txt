Bitcoin won’t change anything it’s a pump and dump ��

Lies Australia doesn’t exist

Bitcoin is still unusable

I know I will get down voted to hell but bitcoin is just a bubble, a pump and dump, it has no value and it’s price is insanely inflated and soon everyone will start to sell, all business will stop accepting bitcoin because it’s losing value for example you bought coffee for $2 worth of bitcoin and 24 hours later the business finds out bitcoin price dropped and now it’s only worth $1 they gonna stop accepting bitcoin immediately. 
Just think about it, how do you expect people to take bitcoin seriously when a cup of coffee cost 0.000213 does that sound like useable currency to you ? If you wanted to borrow $20 from your friend are you gonna ask for $20 worth of bitcoin or 0.002122. Just say it in your head “hey bro can I borrow 0.002122” it sounds stupid, bitcoin is stupid, the whole crypto currency idea is stupid. 
Now enjoy down voting me while I’m making my own crypto currency. I’m gonna call it bitdime and it’s gonna be a billion time better than bitcoin and people gonna buy it and I’m gonna get usd rich because I’m gonna sell it to idiots who believe crypto currency is the future and stuff.

I bought from them. The charges are too high $13 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:29:53
Coinbase is shit to be honest 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:24:06
I’m making a new crypto currency and I’m calling it bitdime and it will be a million times better than bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:38:28
Not joking, I bought $120 worth of bitcoin and paid $133 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:48:22
�� 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:27:39
What about bitdime 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:43:21
I can answer that for coins 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:41:19
Yeah once the big banks gets involved 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:58:38
Well done indeed ��

Antminer is too expensive to be left unattended in a public place. It’s also loud as hell. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:27:58
$1 = 0.000108 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:31:16
It’s like 9650 on that other website 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:00:15
Coinbase is garbage 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:57:12
We gonna buy coffee for 0.000217300 which is dumb. I would invest in bitdime since it doesn’t have many zeros and can be easily understood. Just imagine how much you gonna lose if you forgot a zero 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:44:57
I have the same question. I mean it doesn’t make sense to buy a cup of coffee for 0.0002490
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:49:26
You have to buttons in your wallet one says send and the other is receive. If you want money from me you give me your address which is the the letter and numbers that don’t make any sense and I will copy it and attach an amount to it and after a few minutes your money will arrive to your wallet. 
Bitcoin is just stupid 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:01:13
What if I lost it or it broke
