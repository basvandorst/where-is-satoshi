You realize BTC and BCH share the same miners? Actually BCH has several exclusive miners.

Bitcoin Core was hijacked using mass censorship of this and other communities. I guess keep defending that I guess if you want a stalled coin that won't ever go anywhere.

Do you just make stuff up hoping people will believe you? Because this sort of thing is verifiable. 20-25% txs as BTC. Bitcoin Cash will help the poor because that's what Bitcoin would have achieved.  BCH continues on as Bitcoin now that BTC has failed. Decentralization at work.

Well I hope you get paid for these kinds of comments...otherwise I just feel sad for the brainwashing that still goes on.

Lol what? They aren't even the largest Bitcoin Cash mining pool: 
Bitcoin Cash is more decentralized than Bcore

That's why I use BCH now. BTC has been hijacked and its utility destroyed.

Yes, this is a completely censored community without free speech and open discourse. Not sure that's something to be proud of.
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:29:51
Lol man I hope you don't really believe those lies, and BTC will never have privacy. It's just a hijacked and indefinitely stalled coin. Have a nice day bro.

BTC needs a PoW change yesterday.

No. The BCH communities aren’t controlled with mass censorship and understand that miners make the decisions.
