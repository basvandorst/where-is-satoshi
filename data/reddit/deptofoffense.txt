I would argue that although all this volatility is not good for bitcoins short term, long term it won't really matter.  Bitcoins are clearly valued several times higher than the actual value of the economy you can spend them in, so there is a huge speculative increase, but as long as that is true, and as long as legitimate economic throughput is rapid enough to insulate against major fluctuations (most people who want to buy something with bitcoins have turned cash to coin to PO in &lt;24 hrs) the only way investors and speculators can make money is off of other investors and speculators.
If economic throughput becomes a radically small fraction of market value, then speculation can only shave a little off the actual economy, and the balance is a zero sum "Investor vs. Investor" game.  We are seeing how crappy that is in practice, and since BTC are incredibly short cycled compared to other commodities, after 2-3 years of ups and down with investors cutting each other's throats, things WILL stabilize.  People will eventually peg down the stable worth after we let BTC float on the sine wave for a couple years, and at that point nobody will be laying their throat out there to cut.
I mean for people actually using BTC for economic ends, this incredible speculation doesn't really have an effect on them, because they haven't been holding BTC, so whether they buy 20 coins for $200, or 1 coin for $200, it exits their wallet a few hours later at pretty much the same value.
