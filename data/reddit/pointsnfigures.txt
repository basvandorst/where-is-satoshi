I didn't say that-I said increased debt is deflationary.

Love the humor, but no, not a nigerian prince.

Thailand is very interesting to watch.  The govt is unstable and they have historically had trouble with the Baht.  Will merchants prefer Bitcoin over the local currency?

Germany or US-sorry for the sketchiness.  I am simply trying to help a friend's family in need.  They are on the wrong side of what's going on there and in a very tenuous situation

how do you mine them?

No, that's not true. The velocity of money and the amount that is actually in circulation is what makes the difference.  For example, today the Fed has created a far greater money supply than we have ever had-do we have inflation?  No.  Why?  Because it doesn't turn over.  Money is created and sits.  Ironically, at the same time the Fed has created money, govt has increased debt and tax rates which are deflationary.

It was similar to the Flash Crash in 2010.  I don't think I said it lost it all in one day.

What if Bitcoin is designed to run best in parallel with fiat currency?  Then it's not a threat, but it's a counter balance to governments instituting crap policy (like Argentina)

Some muslim run countries that are undergoing strife; maybe Ukraine, China might.  You never know when you are on the wrong side of the ruler.

If you look at what happened in Egypt, I think you can make a case the world would have found out what was going on and stopped it sooner rather than later

govt is afraid of bitcoin, and wants it to die.  They are fiddling while Rome burns.
