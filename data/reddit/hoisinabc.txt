At some point lots of altcoin holders will move to bitcoin. I’m tempted to buy alts but I feel now its too risky. I will consider later if my gut feeling is right.

In Settings you can resync your wallet. Takes a few minutes, then it shows the correct balance and transactions. A bug.

You pay a premium over the exchanges, but you don’t have to transfer and hold money like with an exchange either. Made almost every trade on LBC (with bank transfer to seller). No problems yet.

Worrying less and less. I’m sticking with BTC plus I’ve got a small amount in one altcoin.

Hi, recently installed it (iOS). To early to rate, but got reply from their support after only a few hours when I emailed them.

I believe many people involved now - perhaps not the latest crowd - understand how the different coins/blockchains and forks are.
The reason btc has &gt;50% market cap always, is that it has been here for 9 years. Its secure. Its THE brand that everyone wants a piece of. To buy other coins you also may need btc.
By now the majority of people in most countries have heard about bitcoin. Not so much the other coins.

I added 0.1 btc to my funds this morning. Although I could have done better (bought on the way down) I am pretty happy:)
Did you add to your funds?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:53:20
My guess is that you will still be able to triple your investment (200%). Best of luck!

Got a quick response from Breadwallet’s support.
Resynched the blockchain. Now its all OK!

11500, you couldnt have done much better than that. Congrats!
Have ether or any other coins depreciated more than btc by the way? Perhaps I should diversify a bit
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:23:46
Yeah, how much? I added 0.1 btc to my funds this morning:)

I have the Bitcoin Ticker app and use that for alerts. You can create a bunch of alarms

Who is afraid of holding?
Please elaborate.

If you choose to trust ten years of history, you know it is going up.
It is only a matter of how long you need to wait.
For ten years, history has reprated itself over and over again. It has yet to fail.
If you choose to trust.

To me it seems history repeats itself over and over. When the market is down it feels like the end and there’s no light in the end of the tunnel.
Then, suddenly, it flips in no time.
I keep the faith. I’m positive and I am gonna be very patient. That means years. Perhaps 2-3-4 years patient:)

Is it? How do you time the bottom?..
