Who said that I have anything against the guy. I'm calling out the picture.
Silk Road, no matter how good its existence was for a jumpstart of Bitcoin, was, for all senses and purposes a black market. Yes, you could buy a lot of things there but it was used mostly for drugs - either buying or selling them.
When you create a meme which just says "Support this guy he was a saint who created this innocent marketplace and guvrnmt thrown him into jail" you're creating a false narrative and making him a martyr.
You're not presenting the facts and ask people to support Ulbricht on the merits of facts, you're painting the narrative which would rile up the large number of people ("Oh, government locked down an innocent man, those bastards")
For all good he's done he wasn't innocent. The debate about the legality of drugs is one for the another time but what he was doing was illegal. And he's not one of those poor kids who're getting locked in prison for years, for the possession and smoking of marijuana.
He was a middleman of one of the largest drug markets on the Internet and he profited from it. His motives weren't entirely altruistic - he wanted to profit from the illegal activity.
Now, was his sentence just? I don't think so. 
But he's not a martyr, he's not a hero who's fallen in battle against the NWO.

I mean. I do believe that two life sentences is harsh however you look at it. I do not condone prison system that is more focused on punishment rather than rehabilitation in the first place but I don't like this meme which paints the guy as an innocent martyr.

It's nice how you frame Silk Road as a simple website for "exchanging goods and services"
