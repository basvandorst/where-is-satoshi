Thanks! I’ll peruse both of these and hopefully find something I can do. :)

I am not overly familiar with the specifics of fees per block, so please take this with a grain of salt.
A block can fit X amount of data (currently 1 MB), which translates to some number of transactions. If miners occupy M of those transactions and Z remain for true senders, they collect Z/(M+Z) x fee per MB + block reward. If the block reward alone were enough to sustain the costs of transacting, then it would be profitable for miners to flood the blockchain as you suggested. However, if there are multiple miners in competition (as there should be for a decentralized and secure system), then the expected value per block goes down, and there is also an incurred fee to the miner of M/(M+Z) x fee per MB. There is likely an optimum here - blocks are worth around 20 BTC each when filled with true transactions currently. The trade off exists between driving the fee up vs driving the relative value of BTC down, as well as the total BTC reward per block. Maybe I can draw up some plots later after a bit more research.
If fees go up, it incentivized more off-chain LN transactions. Assuming mining one’s own transactions alone is not profitable, the fee should settle around a value acceptable to users based on the ratio of core blockchain to LN blockchain transactions.
Again, sorry if my terminology is imprecise, but hopefully that walks us both through some of the trade offs at play.

Does anyone have hot tips for running from a RaspberryPi? Preferred OS, memory card suggestions, security best practices, comments on needing to prune full transaction history?

Is there a list of low hanging fruit open problems that non-experts can meaningfully contribute to as a hobby or side project? E.g. documentation, known bug list, or a list of key projects hat need similar things on the second layer? Frankly, I’m overwhelmed by the amount of things to know as a novice, and that makes it difficult to figure out where to direct my limited efforts.

Transfer from Coinbase to GDAX and then GDAX to a new location is all free.

Make a samourai Segwit wallet. The address should start with a 3. Then request bitcoin from your copay wallet address. You’ll have to pay the transaction mining fee, but your bitcoin will then be transferred to a Segwit address.

Can you not already set up a multi signature transaction with an arbiter that will hold the funds in escrow until at minimum 2/3 parties agree on the tx outcome? I thought this was how purse.io operated, for example.

I’d suggest waiting until you spend then and have your change go to a Segwit address.

Another great idea, thanks! Do I need to run a full node to test LN? What’s the bandwidth usage per month?

I believe they must comply with the regulations of the country in which the customer is located. At least, the US requires companies abroad to follow US finance regulations for transactions with US customers.

I agree, this mirrors my understanding. However, there's currently no alternative to paying high fees. Once LN is active, I think we'll see the ratio of on- and off-chain transactions gravitate towards wherever results in low fees; if miners are filling blocks, more transactions will take place over LN between balancing events. My hope is that miners will realize losses by trying to pad blocks and that users will be able to transact at reasonable rates by leveraging LN transactions. There's more risk in doing many transactions without balancing on chain, but that risk will balance the cost of the transaction and people will end up paying in inverse proportion to the risk they're willing to take.

Thanks for the intro. I’ll have to try this out soon. :)

Can you expand on or post a reference on this?

Can you hard fork Bitcoin to reduce the fundamental unit to some fraction of a Satoshi? If so there is even more credibility to Bitcoin’s perpetual existence.

Thanks for the healthy debate - I learned a lot!

This chart also has horrendous Y axes. At least normalize to the peak value...

One gets charged this every time a credit card is used. It’s implicit in the prices of stores that accept cards as there’s a ~3.5% fee levied by the transaction network.

Accepted with grace, good show!
