Yeah so like, any other public key cryptography that has existed for decades and has nothing at all to do with Bitcoin?

Why on earth does that need to happen, do you seriously invisage a world in which a TV has enough ASICs in it to pay for content? Nobody will be able to hear any of the content over the 1000 CFM you need blowing through the thing to try and keep it cool. 


Please explain what does this get you. 
* Its not useful as a miner
* Its not useful as a place to develop software, you are not doing any serious work on a Raspberry Pi, which has the CPU and general performance of a phone. 
It's useless at either designated task, it just happens to come with some weird ass command line tools that are going to be "mostly" open source. So uh, install them on your own PC like a normal person? 


Why does this "internet of things" even need to write anything into the bitcoin block chain? Why does my fridge need canonicalized storage of transactions? Why does my TV? 


Yeah great, so, you make the network hopelessly overwhelmed by a flood of junk. You should at least go and read how micropayment channels work and realise that's not a goal that needs achieving. You can already do micro bitcoin transactions without needing to make a pool to mine your non viable transactions.

Hi there, I assure you it is impossible to put a mining chip in a phone no matter if it is charging or not. Phones are not made to dissipate large amounts of heat, even with the super low power ARM processors you might get a second or two of turbo clocking before they have to spin down because guess what, a thin ass phone doesn't have anywhere for the heat to go. A charging phone is already heavily limited in speed just because the battery and DC-DC can't put any of the waste heat anywhere, nobody is ever going to try to add more heat in there.


Having lots of money doesn't really mean a whole lot.


Just because something is happening doesn't mean it isn't stupid. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 10:47:48
Huh? You think people want to use public key cryptography so they implement their own ASIC, and use Bitcoin, in order to avoid having to do it themselves? It's literally like two fucking functions in openssl, you make a key, you sign with a key. 
Wana know why I mentioned it this way? 
Its the exact same implementation as in Bitcoin, just without Bitcoin! Oh my god I'll be laughing all the way to venture capital. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 04:15:36
Pretty sure you could get the line
    git clone  &amp;&amp; cd 21 &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
typed faster than your credit card on amazon to buy the thing.

I doubt it, nobody even funds P2Pool (it's dead).

What is the point of buying a raspberry pi with a bitcoin miner on top of it?
@_date: 2015-09-23 08:16:21
Software which can be easily copied to any other device, and which is open source and you can install on any other device? Yeah, that really sounds like I desperately need their hardware to function.
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:03:32
Yeah, you've touched on why I don't think it's a dev kit. If you wanted people developing with their platform you'd be sending out at cost Raspberry Pi with their software or even loss leading them to get them in the hands of more people, the bitcoin miner part is completely irrelevant to people writing software, its existence is almost ridiculous given their FAQ insists you can't make money with it. You don't launch a software platform by asking people to pre-order expensive development hardware, I can't believe anybody is touting that line. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 04:06:41
There's no way that thing is pumping out 50W, it's 10W at most, probably less. The fan and the heatsink are far too small for that, think of an Antminer S1, that was 360W and used a massive blower and two enormous aluminum panels. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 05:23:00
Yet again you've found another stupid place to put in battery powered bitcoin miners. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:09:35


You can't mine on a battery powered device, that's loony toons physics. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 14:12:32


Good luck convincing people to trust that :)

They nailed the 1% fee thing before it was announced. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:24:58


Note, it needs to be centralized otherwise it is vulnerable to sybil attacks. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 04:30:51


Christ, you can buy a ESP8266 and connect it to your wifi network in under 5 minutes and do your shit for free. This doesn't need Bitcoin, a raspberry pi, or a piece of shit miner. You want a communication platform not a cryptocurrency, or what, you're going to wait around for half an hour while your garage door opening command confirms on the block chain? Get real. 


Yeah, like wifi or zigbee are so customer unfriendly. It's not like Phillips Hue and hundreds of other products use them today, without the Bitcoin, blockchain, miners, raspberry pi, or other internet of shitty things buzzwords. 
Stop trying to shoehorn Bitcoin into random shit to justify your venture capital money, just man up, say your mining farms and 3 generations of ham fisted standard cell ASICs were a shitty idea, and call it a day. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 04:14:00


Pruned nodes don't even send blocks to their peers.
@_date: 2015-09-23 14:15:09
It's a massive 22nm die, this mining ASIC can never make it into consumer hardware. The die is literally bigger than the main processor in an iPhone and consumes many times as much power. It's about as sensible as development hardware for a death star (bring your own empire). 
@_date: 2015-09-23 04:50:12
All of this is much easier solved with.. normal payment methods. 


Amusingly, running a full node, one of the stated aims of the product, is extremely intensive and the Pi struggles to keep up with it on a good day. Something about doing all of your IO through a single USB port doesn't exactly bode well for your image of everybody doing everything through Bitcoin.


They already have that without your help.
@_date: 2015-09-22 04:12:09
That's ridiculous. 
USB UART cable for $9.95? [It's $1.40]( 
Fan for $7.99? [It's $1](
@_date: 2015-09-23 04:59:02


You're going to struggle to use Bitcoin without an internet connection. This is much easier solved without trying to shove miners into everything for absolutely no reason. Not in the least the concept of a mobile miner in a system where there's low heat dissipation and low available energy is just plain out fucking stupid. If it was just a "use bitcoin to pay for internet" then sure, maybe that might work in some limited niche, but that's not what this is, is it? 


I doubt that means much in reality, by the looks of it you can get hundreds of millions of dollars in funding without anybody doing even the slightest amount of foresight and critical thinking. They also make chips, they aren't just a networking related company. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 07:58:06
What can I do on this device I can't do on my desktop computer a hundred times faster. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:57:52


Like how you removed your CA trust from Symantic who just signed fake certificates for Google.com? You stopped mining at Ghash.io when they finney attacked betting sites to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars? That's cute but it doesn't happen in the real world. You would also never know about anybody issuing fake devices, that's the point of a sybil attack. 


Who is going to choose this list of vendors and make sure the vendor actually has a specific key? If anyone can join I'm going to be Shenzhen Tech 1, and One Tech Shenzhen, and Tech One Shenzhen, Tech Tech Uno Shenzhen..


You can use a VW Beatle to plow a farm if you want to, but none ever sold or ever will be sold come with a plowshare attachment. Nobody is interested adding obsolete hashcash circuitry to their mining ASICs, that would increase the cost and could cause the failure rate to increase.
 Can is also beside the point, hashcash does not prevent spam in the real world and literally nobody validates the headers which contains them. If you can find a few hundred thousand dollars in VC money I can author you a bitstream for that delicious hashcash if you'd like :)
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:43:30


Yeah that's, centralized. Nothing stops Samsung from inventing tens of thousands of "people" in that sort of system, which is why Bitcoin doesn't use Galaxy S6 serial numbers for sybil breaking. Can you prove every person they say exists does exist in a trustless way? Centralized. 


Yep. 


You can't use Bitcoin mining ASIC for hashcash, even if you did everyone and his dog has an ASIC miner that can blast spam 6 orders of magnitude faster than a CPU. Not that anybody ever used hashcash because it's a shitty concept in isolation, botnets have an advantage and people with mobile devices get fucked. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 04:32:40
How? Bitcoin does not solve any problems in this situation. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 16:24:20
What can't I, as a developer, create on a computer that I can't with a computer an an attached miner.The software is open source as per their claims, so you can't say I am buying it for the software that is there. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 05:09:12
You're talking about negotiating payments with providers using bitcoin, to find an internet connection you can pay with Bitcoin? That's a silly nonsense bootstrapping problem, and SMS doesn't solve it because you would have to know the phone numbers of all the possible providers before the fact (and why didn't you get the rates when you downloaded that information earlier). 
@_date: 2015-09-23 04:34:32
It makes absolutely no sense, it's a piece of off the shelf hardware with a miner glued to the top. At $40 it would make sense as a miner. It's not a development kit, it's not a revolution maker, it's just a shitty product that doesn't even come with the right power cable. If you want to build neat software you don't do it on a raspberry pi with a hairdryer attachment.
@_date: 2015-09-23 05:21:16
Worth noting that Bitcoin as a network transport is about the least efficient, slowest method imaginable. It works for Bitcoin but absolutely nothing else would be stupid enough to use it. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 05:48:15


Why does this need bitcoin miners in shit. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 10:20:36
What I'm saying is that you don't need bitcoin to use public key cryptography, it just happens to be where people here are learning about it. There's no need to involve bitcoin in any of this is if that is your end goal. You want to use ECDSA? Great, go do that. You don't need Bitcoin, mining, a distributed consensus, an internet of things, ASICs, or this fucking raspberry pi with a hairdryer attached to it.
