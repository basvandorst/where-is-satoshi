100 bytes isn't enough to contain all the components to make a block valid. 
Blocks smaller than 200 bytes are pretty common though:

How would increasing the block size reduce the time it takes for data to propagate across the network?
Maybe you're confusing this with Gavin's [IBLT Proposal?](

I don't disagree; there are various reasons why this is true. I understand that in a production model the cold device would have to be embedded software running on specialized hardware, but a project of that size isn't something I can tackle in my spare time for a proof-of-concept.
I only mentioned Trezor's UX in my video as a reference point for what is considered to be a typical hardware wallet today. Their product is great and I wouldn't criticize their security approach.

I'm being serious. Not trolling.
Reconsider your original statement, and consider the following:
Assuming use of a secure cipher algorithm, encrypted data can't be reversed without the encryption key. Whether or not someone else has access to your encrypted key should be irrelevant. 
If you don't believe this, you essentially don't believe in encryption. And logically, if you don't believe in encryption you shouldn't believe in the security concepts behind Bitcoin.

I agree, a product like this would be an excellent use-case for deterministic seeds.

Yes. IBLTs are what miners should be afraid of if they're worried about losing tx fees.
I have a feeling the community would start proposing mandatory fees at that point.

Yes, as you implied, encryption takes place on the cold device. The encrypted keys are sent to the hot devices and mailed to the user.


If a cypher is secure, you can share encrypted data with the whole world without fear of your message being decoded. I'm using AES to encrypt the keys, which is considered to be secure.
The only concern is a weak encryption key. If you follow proper security practices and use a strong encryption key your data should be safe regardless of who has access to the cyphertext.

My goal wasn't to improve on security over a product like Trezor. Trezor is an excellent product for secure key storage. I wanted to present a method that's just as secure, and also more convenient for day-to-day purchases.


There's no way to get around the need for 2-way communication between hot/cold. Would you also argue that the Trezor isn't completely cold because it communicates with a hot device via USB? You might argue that an attack over USB could take place just as easily as over ethernet.
Ethernet was the easiest implementation for a quick proof-of-concept. This could be changed to USB, NFC, bluetooth, audio/mic jack, magnetic pulses, or any other obscure communication method if you preferred.


I definitely agree with this point. I used Raspbian for the concept. Aside from the fact that the RPI's form-factor is massive, there are a lot of other reasons why you wouldn't want to use them for a commercial product. They're very easy to work with though; great for a proof-of-concept.

Well, someone can attempt to brute-force your private key whether then have any information about it or not. Think about it this way:
Bitcoin private keys use a 160-bit keyspace (20 bytes).
This means that if you were to encrypt a private key with an ASCII passphrase that's &gt;= 20 characters, a brute-force attack on your "encrypted key" (assuming you used a secure encryption scheme) should be just as difficult as attempting to brute-force the original key without any prior knowledge.
A password like [correct horse battery staple]( should be more than sufficient in keeping your private key safe.

Fees won't go away. Adding more TXs to a block increases the block size and slows propagation amongst nodes in the network. Miners want blocks to propagate as quickly as possible so they can get the reward before another miner does. The main purpose of tx fees is to offset this risk.

A MITM attack at the browser/network level can still redirect your funds to the attackers address rather than the address that you think you're sending to. You wouldn't realize it until it's too late. It would probably take only 30 minutes to design a Chrome browser extension that would do this.
Do you have any Chrome browser extensions installed? If I was a malicious attacker I'd offer to buy-out a popular Chrome extension and add this type of functionality quietly. I could get 100k installs overnight this way. I could easily inject JS to modify the receiver address and BTC amount right at the moment that you hit the send button. This would be after you've already logged in and gone through your 2FA process.
This isn't possible with a hardware wallet like Trezor that requires you to confirm the transaction on the hardware device.
If you really think web wallets are secure, you're very wrong.

This doesn't make any sense. What do you mean by "if the wallet doesn't exist"? Miner's can't know if an address exists in a wallet that's owned by somewhere.
If the tx was invalid, it wouldn't have been successfully broadcasted to the network in the first place.

Interesting attack. You will lose money if a non-participating miner includes your txs in a block though.
@_date: 2016-11-24 07:39:55
I imagine trying to actually execute this attack would result in paying more in fees than you'd recoup from the increase in overall fee increases, unless you and your group are mining a pretty significant % of blocks (over 50% maybe?)
