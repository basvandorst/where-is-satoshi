You got one more person to support your idea with BTC.
Thanks for calling for creativity in the community.
I really hope one of us can come up with a good one.

Business may be fair, or may not be fair.
The blockchain technology will give us a chance to attach trusted information to transactions or tokens... like trusted audits of fairness.
 And will allow us to make decisions based on our own sense of fairness.

Afaik, not without a LN node. (Which is not a BTC node and is much lighter)

I used to be an open source zealot everywhere I'd go. (I make a living of open source.) I failed miserably because most people would not understand what I was talking about.
It took me a long time to understand that the first step I should take was to listen to people in order to grasp until what level they understood IT and programming. Which would be the only way to evangelize with words that would make sense to them.
I think Bitcoin evangelists are faced with the same issue : learn that others do not breath IT and even less cryptocurrency. In other words, try to understand what others do not get instead of bashing them.

Would you mind pointing to tutorial-like info that explains how to mine altcoins ?

Interesting questions raised.

Where can I find more details to understand what a "full node" is ?
