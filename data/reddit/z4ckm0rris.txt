Better question would be "even knows what a wallet is?"
From the sound of things, she gave money to a stranger and she lost his number as her phone was stolen. I honestly tried to get out of that conversation. 
I work in an economically challenged part of town and it's not the first time something like this has come up.. I've also been asked about Penny stocks by people in the same situation.

Of course. Regardless of a person's economic situation, they still don't want to be a burden to their family after the fact. They're not taking out 250k+ term policies, but rather smaller whole life policies with the intent of covering their funeral/burial costs so their family doesn't have to.

Similar run in yesterday. I met with some clients whom I put together their life insurance for. At the end of our appointment she asked "what do you think about bitcoin?" I told her "I'm too late to the party" and she told me that she thinks she got in. Mind you this is a woman living on Disability in a not so good part of town. No car, no computer, just a cell phone...I think the vast majority of people view Bitcoin as an opportunity to get rich. I'm pretty sure she gave money to some stranger who "bought her bitcoin."

I like the varying attire in the room.. Some people in suits, some people in dress shirts.. and then you have the guy in the back in a jean vest.
