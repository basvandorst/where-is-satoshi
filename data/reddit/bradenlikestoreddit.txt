It's a show rollout because they are smart. Give it time.

Haha I think I joined around the 800k mark. But we also have to consider the rollout to each state. I think they are only starting with like 4. Hopefully it doesn't take long.

Same here. In fact I invested in my first stocks thanks to Bitcoin. I haven't invested into crypto yet just because it's not the most user friendly process and there are too many options in terms of wallets. So Robinhood will be my best friend.

OP is out of context. That's not what he said.

Nice job on taking it out of context. But yes, the entire conversation seems realistic to me and makes a lot of fucking sense. Women wearing heels to make their legs and ass more attractive but don't want men looking at them is a bit hypocritical, no?

Looks to me like he's just giving them a taste of their own medicine
@_date: 2018-12-28 00:49:02
Any other evidence or just this one example? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:26:18
I agree, and I imagine there's more to it. I'll look into it.

Basically some guy who I find to be very intelligent and interesting to sit and listen to but everyone hates because he's realistic and people get offended by him and cry like babies. Prob half the people that will comment on this.
