Nice to here someone's real story - I hope you resolve your issue, and thank you for spreading it here as it's useful for other people so they can follow your advice.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:23:09
That's incorrect. Have a look at [ While the Bitcoin mempool is suffering heavily currently, the average fees are not that high. However, some exchanges require high fees to disincentive users from withdrawing.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:36:56
This has been posted a few times before on this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:01:21
I'm glad you got your money back.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:26:25
Haha that's brilliant! I didn't know that! Well, we've won. That's it. Buy Bitcoin. I pretty much agree with everything he's said in this video - especially the bit about how Bitcoin is massive now but perhaps another cryptocurrency will take over in the future, as we have to admit Bitcoin has some problem (like the massive mempool right now).
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:56:31
That's very odd. Bitcoin cannot be "expired", so I imagine Coinbase is annoyed and is trying to get that Bitcoin back as it's worth so much now. I would recommend opening up a support ticket, though expect delays as their services is ever-expanding.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:31:05
It's a regulated market, so I don't think that's possible.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:23:29
Honesty, I think Bitcoin will either die or live at this point. There could be something catastrophic in the next few months that kills it or it lives for ever. With all this new attention, Bitcoin could have a massive crash as one could say the price is bought on by FOMO rather than people who believe in the currency. On the other hand, Bitcoin Futures will enter Bitcoin into the real world of finance, and hopefully bring *some* stability to the market, which it desperately needs if it's going to be treated seriously. Also, if the mempool is sorted out with Lightning Network within the next year or so then I think Bitcoin is in for the win.
And, even if Bitcoin doesn't make it, I think cryptocurrencies and certainly the blockchain will live on. Let's just hope the best for Bitcoin and try to spread the news of this revolutionary technology/currency.

I'd like to see the maths you did. Doesn't sound accurate to me.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:06:21
Cheers. I will try this. Copay is a multisig wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:11:26
I'm a copay user, and I have had some bitcoin in it for a week or so. Where can I access this BCH that I now supposedly own? Copay does not support bcash, however it is a true bitcoin wallet. So how do I move my bitcoins (on the same device) from one wallet to another, while maintaining my BTC and getting my new BCH?
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:14:52
But it's a fork of bitcoin. Were allowed to talk about BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:28:29
As long as you're in it for the long haul it doesn't really matter (up to a reasonable point, anyway) what price you buy at, as long as you HODL it.
Obviously, just remember that everything you read on this subreddit, or in fact anywhere on the internet, is *not* proper financial advice. It is all speculation. When making a decision, make sure you make sure it's *your* decision. Not someone else's.

So just because segwit activates doesn't mean a hardfork will occur? Also, I don't see anything about segwit or the coming softfork/potentially hardfork on the sidebar. That's why I posted.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:39:13
Yeah. Blockchain technology was *invented* in 2010 (really 2009 I think?) but I think it will really come into action with the public, ie people who aren't specifically interested in technology and crytocurrency, in the 2020s.

Cheers, will keep an eye on this.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:26:27
Yeah, I know that. But you have a run a mining rig for a long time to mine a single bitcoin. It would take over $1000 even if you were in an area with cheap electricity. If it did only take $1000 to mine a bitcoin then a lot more people would do it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:57:17
Nice! I brought in at around £1800, so you must be even more happy than I!
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:22:35
Where do you get this info? Is it on blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:11:12
Okay, thank you. I didn't know this. Will check what my wallet is. Again, thanks for taking the time to answer my questions, hope you get an answer for yours too!
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:12:57
Just remember: if you BTC that was in the wallet before the fork is on your desktop, don't put your new BCH wallet on that desktop. Put it on your phone or another computer. Or use some software like VirtualBox to simulate another operating system. 
I'd recommend moving your bitcoin out of your current wallet, then importing your seed/private keys from the empty BTC wallet into a wallet that supports BCH. You will find yourself with the equivalent amount of BTC in BCH. 
Once you have this BCH I would recommend using Bittrex, like mentioned. Just beware: they call it BCC over there, so don't get confused :)
PS: I would recommend not using more that 20 sat/byte when sending you BCH to bittrex; the mempool is really small.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:20:58
Umm.. I think there's been a misunderstanding. I mean the coin that will occur with the hard fork in a few hours.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:10:02


@_date: 2017-08-12 09:56:08
Sorry for the late reply.
I haven't needed to move my bitcoins yet, but when I do I will try to remember this thread and post a reply.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:38:47
I'm no expert, just applying logic; if bitcoin only costs $1000 in electricity to mine then surely a lot more people would have bitcoin miners. Then it would become more difficult to mine bitcoin because of so many competitors and it would be more expensive to mine bitcoin.
What am I doing wrong? Can someone explain to me?
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:01:37
Uh... I don't know if this is a joke...
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:08:46
Can I see some maths? Or should I just trust your word /s
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:06:47
It's okay. You should be glad you got to buy now instead of waiting for the price to go up. Don't expect immediate returns; bitcoin is very volatile. While I believe, in the long run, bitcoin will increase in value, doesn't mean we won't have some bumpy roads on the way.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:10:42
Yup! I've been talking to my friends about it and convinced a couple of them to invest. They keep moaning about how they should've invested earlier, and I keep reminding them that bitcoin will go to the *moon*, so £3000 will seem like a really cheap price.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:42:10
I can understand that, however there are plenty of posts with hundreds of upvotes regarding BCH on this subreddit. BCH isn't bitcoin. But it is a fork *of* bitcoin, so I think we should be allowed to discuss it.
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:57:31
Especially as cryptocurrency in general is quite controversal. Hiding the votes helps people give their real opinion, as you've said.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:56:32
Wow. That is cheap. Thanks for the answer!
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:52:41
If we break 14k I reckon we will pass 20k in a matter of days.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:27:26
Yeah, there's a comment from a mod saying it's been removed... But it hasn't. How does that work?
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:12:52
Well if we compare what we're seeing now to what we saw in the 2017 bull run then it only took 8 days to (almost) hit 20k from where we are now. At the moment we're in a bit of a correction, but I'm still bullish looking at the weekly/daily chart.

I think could is an understatement to be honest. Binance is one of the biggest exchanges, so we'll see a lot of price action and a lot higher volume.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:01:00
It's news for me too. I thought the reason big blocks weren't a good idea is because it's not economically viable.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:11:26
If you're talking about me then I have not been to that film festival. However, it does sound rather interesting. Googling now!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:44:21
The post has some good reasons, but my main reason is the fact that I know it's economically invisible to just have bigger blocks for a currency as well used (in cryptocurrency terms, not fiat terms) as well as knowing bitcoin cash is a dump and pump scheme, meaning it will have no value in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:40:56
Read a book on Bitcoin. Read Satoshi's whitepaper. Read the Bitcoin news once a week. Find a cryptocurrency/Bitcoin Youtube channel you enjoy and try to tune into as many videos as possible.
The best education is interactive, so try setting up an account on Coinbase, buying some BTC, and sending it to a personal wallet. It will allow you to become curious about the blockchain/mempool. On top of this, keep interacting with the community, as you will find yourself asking questions, and finding great answers. I know that most people on this sub would be more than willing to answer a few queries, as we all want to see Bitcoin succeed - the best way to quarantee that is to interest other people and convincing friends to start using this revolutionary currency.
Hopefully, when you reach the point where you feel confident in your knowledge of crypto, you can try and interrogate some of your friends to join our wonderful cult.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:35:19
Oh okay, thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:20:44
You're right, however I think censorship still relevant to this post.

Yup, really glad to see this! However, the new British notes have braille too.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:33:08
I think that's rather short-sighted. While BCH originated from Bitcoin, they are still entirely different currencies. Hopefully the Reddit team will see enough of a difference for some sort of change.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:58:16
Excuse me sir, Briton here.
I'm European, but here in the UK they teach it the 'Murican way.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:35:23
I agree with this, however I do not think it is the full answer to this story. While many of these transactions are likely from wallets that do not allow you to set a custom fee, resulting in poorly decided transaction fees.
On the other hand, you have to consider large companies will choose a large fee as speed is key for their situation. As well as this, many exchanges will group 100s of user transactions together, resulting in a small fee for the user but a large tx fee they have to pay - each user will pay a small amount for a really high fee.
But yes, ultimately, choose your wallet wisely kids.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:04:59
Yes let's laugh at the people with a different opinion /s
Seriously, I hope you're joking?
I don't like BCH myself, but I don't spit on the people who *do* like it, even if there are *loads* of reasons to not use it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:49:51
I think this is a great idea, however why did you *only* offer Bitcoin as payment? Surely that made customers sceptical about your business if they didn't know what Bitcoin is?

Also, withdrawing funds from GDAX requires no fee, whereas Coinbase takes a fee. This is stupid, because transferring funds between Coinbase and GDAX is free and instant as they are owned by the same company (or GDAX is owned by Coinbase?). Bare in mind there is a minimum withdraw of 0.0001 BTC from GDAX, but this shouldn't be a problem.
@_date: 2017-09-06 08:08:24
Unless you transfer to GDAX (which is free) and then withdraw from GDAX (which is also free).

I used to like WCN but I feel the quality of content decreased massively as they all went to Europe and I mostly went to just watch a little of Tone's market analysis and Jimmy Song's talk of the technicals from the perspective as a developer. I wish they didn't talk of stupid memes (that's for Reddit) and news. The news is important, but I wish they would discuss it more objectively and from the opinion of all cryptocurrency and blockchain instead of just Bitcoin. They are called "World Crypto Network" not "World Bitcoin network".
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:02:32
I'm talking about the World Crypto Network, not this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:33:43

Youtube. Subscribe to an email blast for news. Read some books (I've personally read "Bitcoin: The Future of Money" but I hear "Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies" is also very good!). As stated, sign up to Coinbase and buy a little Bitcoin. Then maybe setup an account on GDAX (which should take no time as GDAX is owned by Coinbase) and do a little bit of trading with money you're willing to lose. Don't get addicted, most of the time it doesn't work out well and you're better of just keeping your money and letting it increase in value. But you might enjoy the experience.
Read the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto. It's very technical but nonetheless worth a read. Also, read up on the blockchain technology, the underlying cogs and wheels that let Bitcoin work. It's incredibly interesting and possibly as innovative as the Internet itself. Perhaps we'll even be capitalising Blockchain in the future.
If you feel you have a pretty good grasp on Bitcoin then try reading into other cryptocurrencies. Just be careful, as a lot of them are completely worthless, but if you see some potential then sign up on Bittrex or some other exchange that supports it and buy a little.
Now that you've educated yourself, and you're ready to start investing some real big money, make sure you DCA (Dollar Cost Average). This means you buy in increments so you get the best value for money. The price dips? Buy some more. Don't just put it all in at the same time as it's quite risky. Instead, by following the DCA method, you are spreading your risk, decreasing your loses.

Actually if you are the taker you pay 0.25% fee (which can change all the way down to 0.01% depending on volume and how much you trade) and the maker pays 0%. Read more about GDAX fees [here](

I was not talking about bitzfree in that comment. I was talking about how I might be too expensive for me to go into bitcoin mining. I gathered from the comment I replied to previously that cloud mining is a scam, therefore I won't be able to afford the equipment necessary to start a mining rig.

I agree. Switching from Tunnelbear for cheaper price and the fact that they don't filter content *at all*, whereas Tunnelbear does not allow torrents. Also, PIA appear to have been around longer and are used by more people, so considering this, they are probably the most experienced.

Exactly. A lot more harm done in the time when you're either not with a VPN provider, even for a short amount of time. As well as this, you're bound to come across a provider that doesn't offer all the benefits of PIA, e.g. no logs/DNS protection or anything else really.
