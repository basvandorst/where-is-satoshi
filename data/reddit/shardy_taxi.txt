I believe the only way you would have them disclose a customer identity is if the request were made by a law enforcement agency which would require you making a formal report of theft to your local police and submit evidence of initial ownership and then tell them you have reasons to believe this is where some of your coins.....bla bla bitfinex. Then if they cbf'ed looking into to your matter then they may get a lead in the case....this link should 
Good Luck ����

It is the intention to lawfully establish that you are the source of the funds that
were created, by the use of your signature on a contract (promissory note) that
creates the value that is loaned back to you under the illusion of a loan of the
bank’s money.
Since there is no lawful money (gold or silver) in circulation, backed by anything
of value, the governments and banks as well as you and I, are essentially
bankrupt.The pieces of paper circulating in place of money, affectionately called
“currency”are in reality debt notes. Worthless.

If you document all the damage,eg. photos, repair receipts, replacement costs....,  you can make a claim for reimbursement. It will take some patience though until you speak to someone who isnt dumb, ignorant and arrogant. Best of luck

Grandma may not be alive long enough to be impressed by any potential returns from a crypto investment. Best you make her happy whilst she is still with us and not have her stress about such unknown investments. When she has passed, burn it wherever you like. Good luck and may god bless  Grandma

It ain't  scarce when created from nothing, then forked from nothing to more nothing of another kind..... apart from being digital it ain't anything or of any more value than paper money.  
Gold is gold. No matter how is used its always recoverable n be made into gold. It's also limited, can't be forked, printed, cloned....
