Honest question: If Bitcoin is outlawed tomorrow (as with gold when it was illegal to hold gold) will you honor the government's request to relinquish your coins or would you willinging break the law and refuse to?

He cashed out at 17k and didn't buy the dip so he got rekt.

Sorry to wake you but it will not happen. He came to fame for proposing universal basic income, not the first to do so but you don't want to be proposing ideas that lunatics endorse.

I still feel weird about that, if he believed in Litecoin I feel like he would have kept it. Everyone's just here to get rich I guess. I don't have anything against that part of it to be fair to him.

I know a guy selling cocaine that accepts Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-09 00:58:45
I simply do not support this guy but Twitter has actually open sourced quite a bit of tools their [GitHub]( list quite a few projects.
@_date: 2019-03-10 01:11:55
...And they won't. Most people who have no idea what Bitcoin is think it's only for evil doers and unfortunately most of these people are sitting in congress. I also have no problem with paying taxes but why does the Government really need to enter the fray? I can only put it down to them stealing its citizens money once again as it does with it inflationary monetary system. If Bitcoin is so worthless as many of THEIR experts say why not leave it alone to simply crash?
@_date: 2019-03-31 23:10:50
Don't fret too much, you can't buy much at the moment but when more merchants start to accept Bitcoin Bitcoin will be worth much much more than it does today. So if you look at the bright side when you are able to spend it it will be worth 10s of thousands. Granted people around here call me a sceptic.

At least you know that fiat is your current girlfriend/wife and you can't live without her because even if you're flirting with Bitcoin the only way it benefits you is if you sell it for fiat when it appreciates. You're always running back to your sweet ol' wife.

No merchant would appreciate a public bad review or negative press. It's exactly the same as when you pay with cash. There is no dispute you can open if you pay with cash. You can't cancel a cash payment after it has occured. A cashless society has really skewed the way we think about trading. If I gave you 3 fish for a loaf of bread there is no charge back either.

Shilling for Flypme? I've never heard of it but good job because a lot of people will look at this infographic and run there without doing any research.

The banks are the real pigs but anything toppling the banks is fine by me. As grotesque as this sounds the banking system is a criminal cartel and I can't believe it took me this long to see.

You guys are so awesome for making this open source.

Try researching the terms cold wallet, hardware wallet or signing wallet. Again these things cost money and if you will be holding a few satoshis in there it might not be of interest to you. You can also look at paper wallets but they are a little complicated for a beginner but with these types of wallets you control your own money.

Bitcoin will be $500,000,000,0000 in 2019. Just buckle up and watch. That is all.

It's just a mess. Most people don't care about privacy so it will fly with most people.

I definitely feel your pain and I totally agree with this. Even if you have something set up most banks will block anything crypto related (at least at first, until you put pressure on them which is a hassle). I mentioned this in a previous post and most people seem to approach these questions without removing the fact that they understand the ins and outs of cryptocurrencies. People don't seem to understand entrepreneurship or business. When you need cash you need it NOW and you don't want to jump through hoops to get it. All these obscure companies people are pointing to don't have that level of trust a business owner needs.
Although my response seems all doom &amp; gloom I'd suggest at least owning some Bitcoin even more so now, it going to run up and you don't really want to miss out (\*not investment advice) maybe one day you'll be able to transact in crypto only (not only Bitcoin) i.e maybe one day your local grocer will accept Bitcoin until then I have to agree with you.

How do you know where the transfers originated? For instance a wallet on Coinbase, how do you know it was a Coinbase wallet?

Not to store it for you. He specifically stated that he was talking about services like custody and loans.

Because it's about the guy who invented Bitcoins. Apparently he minted them himself. Why is he being treated like this?

Sorry to say but this was your mistake not necessarily a flaw in LocalBTC. Most sites like this DO NOT recommend transacting outside the walled garden of their system. Either way I'm sorry to hear that this has happened but please learn from this.
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:39:01
Not everyone knows these silly acronyms. I think that makes sense you once had to learn too.

He means overclocking. Sorry, some internet users can be dickheads sometimes. I apologize. 
EDIT: He's actually not giving you sane advice either you should only overclock your GPU if you know what you're doing. You could possibly damage the hardware permanently considering the risks there are a plethora of guides on the internet.

It had the option to sell but I didn't try it out I was just trying to buy at the time. The one I used supported BTC, ETH, LTC.

Forget about it, it's $1.00 fee and the exchange rate is prohibitive. When Litecoin was ~109 I checked one of these machines and it was ~158 per Litecoin.

We need a cure for cancer. The answer is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:28:09
Clearly trolling. No one in their right minds would agree to be forced into using a system with irreversible transactions. If you're buying coke then fine use Bitcoin. 
In this case why are they not offering other payment options instead of the one you do not understand how to use?

This is the best comment I have ever seen here.

The term literally emerged from the idea of cleaning (doing money laundry on) dirty money. It's not a stand in term at all. They should never be substituted a moral person would never need to clean money.
