I mean, realistically, I've sat through more of these type of dips (e.g. drop to ~50% ATH) than I can count.
As long as you are *only* buying with money you can afford to lose, you can HODL as long as necessary.

Heh, I remember 2013.  The ATH hit like $1200 or so, then it slowly sank to around $200.  But I held on.

Easy to HODL when you already pulled your initial investment out and are gambling with the house's money.

No, it is not (so far).  I sat through the 2013 crash that slowly sank from $1300 to about $150.  Lost about 90% of its value.
I had bought in at $700.

I don't think it will go that low, but I do expect around $5K (note: "around" means possibly dipping under).
Whatever it does, it's been a wild ride.
And to answer OP, definitely note bullish.  It has not hit bottom and we still have a bit to fall.

I bought in at about $700, watched it get to its peak, then slowly sink to its low.  After a while, I just tuned it out.  Didn't check the price again until 2017.

I've already recouped my original investment and pulled gains out periodically.  Playing with the house's money.  Whatever it does, I've still realized a serious return.

It's winter.  The heat from miners would be useful.

The realtor says that **now** is the best time to buy!
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:25:59
I bet it goes to $5K
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:14:29
I think it's got a ways to go down still.  Not sure where I'd buy back in, but not now.

Oof!  Everyone, repeat after me: "Do not buy with money you cannot afford to lose."
If you are buying with a fucking credit card, then it is almost certainly money that you cannot afford to lose.

i agree.
