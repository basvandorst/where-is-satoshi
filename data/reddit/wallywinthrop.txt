More companies accepting bitcoin is great, but I just can't see it making sense for these guy since most of the bitcoin community is nerdy enough to build their own PCs.

To the best of my knowldge there weren't any games released on vinyl. There were a bunch on LaserDisc though. I did however manage to find something about a new wave band hiding a text file on a record. [Check out  from this Cracked article for more details.](

It really depends on what you are planning to do with them. If you are going to buy a bit to hold on to then it might not be the worst idea in the world. What you don't want to do is get involved in day trading bitcoins. 
I suggest you take the time to research how bitcoin works. Get a good overview of the underlying technology. Base your final decision on whether you believe in the technology and the benefits it offers over more traditional forms of payment.

IANAL but I think that in this case it wouldn't technically be entrapment. From my understanding it is only entrapment if the police coerced you into doing something that you otherwise wouldn't have done. This is somewhat similar to a situation where a guy walks up to you on the street and asks you to cop some drugs for them. When you come back with the drugs the guy (who is actually a cop) arrests you. And that is a considered a perfectly valid arrest.

In regards to making you fill out a capcha before posting your comment I believe that it is only done to people with new accounts to prevent spam and other forms of abuse. I do agree with you that it is ridiculous that a place as big as reddit doesn't allow for auditory capchas.

I object to the whole take coinbase problems to stance. Assuming the wronged party did their part and contacted coinbase to try and fix it; some public shaming goes a long way towards getting the staff to address the problem. And is a lot better for public shaming than due to the number of subscribers.
Granted it does get annoying seeing all these Coinbase posts on here. I mean you don't see me making self posts because those incompetent yokels can't verify my god damned identity for three fucking months now.

The thing is even if we did have completely open source Android implementations they can still spy on you through the cellular network unless you  don't call anyone and only use your data connection to send PGP encrypted messages to the people you wish to communicate with, but even then I've heard that the NSA has the resources to bruteforce PGP.

I think the problem is that a lot of the time people don't take the time to read the articles in the first place. They expect to be spoon fed information that is readily available.

How is it a piece of crap? I haven't had a chance to fiddle around with one, but it seems that the biggest beef people have with the OUYA is their own unreasonable expectations. If you view it as an immobile Android device it's pretty nifty. Granted the only reason most people would want one is to watch videos or play emulated games on their TV.

Because the information is there and not reading the articles is lazy. Not only that but I'd consider asking well documented questions to be disrespectful. Both to the person who took the time to initially answer the question and document it and to the person you get to finally reiterate it for you. It is as if you are saying my time is too important to do my own reaserch so spoon feed it to me. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:43:40


I'd argue that you can't exploit yourself. Exploitation involves one party benefiting at the expense of another, but here the women are just straight up profiting.

They should at least put in some effort to attempt to learn it. Just because these hypothetical people have problems with reading comprehension doesn't mean they're completely incapable of learning something from reading a text. 
Not even trying is fucking lazy like I said earlier and demanding people spoon feed you the info makes you sound entitled.

For two reasons. They can continue running the site and steal more coins later. And making it look like a genuine fuck up rather then outright theft will keep the effected users from mounting a which hunt to find the SysOp like what happened with a certain other marketplace.

Not 100% on this, but I think it might be Lite Coin which is basically a Bitcoin clone.

Depending on the amount of coins you're storing you might wanna go for both burned CD and thumbdrive for storage. Burned CDs have a habit of becoming unreadable after a couple of years and it never hurts to have a secondary backup.
