Do i have to spell it out? World disagrees with indonesia's opinion. Why am i wasting my fingers.. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:57:59
World kindly disagrees.

World disagrees that bitcoin is not currency or payment tool.

Next thing you know they will be replacing car wheels with blockchain because oh its so awesome. People are getting carried away...

You are right, but lots of people are doing it wrong. Somewhere i saw idea of p2p email based on blockchain. I just wanted to shake my head in disbelief..

For quite some time when i hear of retarded laws/regulations they usually came from Australia. Wth is wrong with their gov..

Now whose fault is that americans love to spend money they dont have on things they dont need. Perfect solution us actually using a debit card instead of credit card. Spend money you actually have.

And he throws ``save the children`` card. It's parent's job, not government's. Invest in parents and not ``save the children`` crap.

I immediately believed this though. People get all kinds of retarded ideas for bitcoin use. Tomorrow we might be reading on reddit about pets on blockchain.

So wait.. Do i get this right? Terrorists tried to censor free speech therefore they shot over 10 people right? Right. So to combat free speech censoring by terrorists plan is to censor everything globally on government level right? Apparently right. Seems like terrorists win.
Makes me wonder on whose side governments are. Because reality is it wont change much. Normal people might not get to use these services. Those that do not care about laws would still have a way to communicate securely. What it is supposed to solve i dont know.

Exactly. Title is miserable clickbait. :\

If "Putin did it" enough times no wonder everyone starts to assume new nasty thing is done by same person.

I think he can only double-spend bitruble.

Biggest problem LUKS has is lack of on-the-fly encryption. Otherwise its great. If user plans ahead then there is no downside. Im using it myself.

K lets see... A communications network + distributed ledger. Is it me alone who thinks it sounds retarded? Okay... Pets on blockchain must be not that far away. Keeping fingers crossed they come after meganet.
