Because there is a reward system.

You can't setup a https request without a certificate.

The exit node cant see your data when using https.

So? Last I checked my packets to the bank are encrypted.

Confirmed my EUR/BTC balance is correct :) :(

Visa gift cards are uncommon in Europe. I've never seen it anyway.

Err, I didn't know that. I had ~200eur stuck there. Am I too late?

BTC transactions should get a small discount.

And thus generate a warning screen

Thanks for the URL!

Edit: Ah you literally mean bullying the user to use http. Yes that works

He says he used an Internation Bank Account Number to perform a SEPA-transfer which landed within 48h. Or that's how I interpreted it.
@_date: 2014-11-27 10:57:02
True, in that case an attack is very easy indeed.
@_date: 2014-10-28 07:01:38
*Please* make sure that you do.

Bitcoin is Bitcoin.
bitcoin is the blockchain protocol used by most cryptocurrencies.
Edit: damn, switched them around :(

The first few messages are cleartext.
Search for TLS-handshake.
In this handshake the client and https server decide what encryption and method of key exchange they'll use.
Search for "Diffi Helman key exchange" to understand why nobody, even when they get all packets, can decrypt their conversation.
The khan academy has a great video on it. I'm on phone, else i'd give links.
I'll update this later today.

Ignore them, It helped me a lot.

As I've said on another forum:
People don't have bitcoins.
Try allowing them to register and top up their balance with paypal.
Since I'm now on Reddit I'll make my reaction a bit longer by elaborating.
BitCoin is f*cking amazing! ( I'm European so I get to say the word amazing in ANY context I like ).
However it's very hard to get coins quickly. I have to wait 5 days to get my coins into my wallet.
If OP would allow users to register he could do so much more.
One example would be to allow users to top-up their balance by paying using a variety of methods ( PayPal ).
Users wouldn't have to go through the trouble of paying, waiting and then downloading. It could become instantly OR after pressing the 'Im ok with paying xx coins for this totally legal file'-button.

I dont mind flying/driving to germany if that means I can have semi-instant deposits/withdrawals.
Especially if that means my money is safe too 24/7.

Sweet, just-eat.be apparently as well!
And with the current profits I'll be eating free!!
Edit: My friends mocked me for buying BTC. Every time we meet we order at just-eat.be as it's one of the biggest online take-away sites. The food will taste so much better now!

Yeah, BitStamp is indeed better for Sepa-users.
