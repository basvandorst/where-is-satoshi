Here is the relevant legal information on this, specifically pertaining to the IRS:
"The federal government waives its sovereign immunity when an officer or employee of the IRS recklessly, intentionally or negligently disregards any provision of the tax law in connection with the collection of any federal tax.  If an IRS employee engages in this type of unauthorized collection action, the taxpayer may sue the U.S. government (but not the IRS Commissioner, an IRS agent, or any other individual) in a federal district court.  Before filing such a suit, however, a taxpayer must first exhaust all administrative remedies within the IRS."
The IRS loosing tax information falls under negligence. If they did not refund all costs out of court, including lost wages, the government waives it's immunity and allows the suite. This provision was established through the [federal tort claims act of 1946]( the [Tucker act of 1887]( and numerous executive and IRS policies through the years.

You can sue for all that back, sure it'll take time but as long as it wasn't your fault and they actually lost the form, it'll take time and effort, but you'll be good.

Except you can get around that in 2 seconds by simply asking someone else to donate to the person or gifting the funds as a private citizen instead of as a corporate representative (and saying it's a gift without the expectation of reciprocation, kinda like how campaign contributions are legal).

I find that paper dubious, being as the main example they used for the IRS being untouchable, [Morris v. United States]( was actually thrown out because the case revolved around malicious prosecution/abuse of process by a union representative who called some friends at the IRS to harass Morris for not using union labor, not a tort violation, which would be all the act covered. They sued under the wrong law. I'm not saying that it's easy to do, it usually takes about a year, and a ton of paper work, but I personally know 2 people who have done it in cases almost identical to this. The US court of federal claims might also be easier to file through though.

You can also use business expenses on illegal sources of income as a tax deduction (except, as of a few years ago, drug dealers after one successfully used his weed, burner phones and assorted paraphernalia as tax deductible expenses). You can also use court costs defending an illegal business as a tax deduction.

Actually, yes it is a tax deductible charity in this case. You would be right if it was a personal gift or donation directly to him, but what this actually is is a donation to the Courage foundation, a whistle-blower support charity (not just for snowden) that is legally registered as a non-profit charity in the US. They in turn help fund his legal team and lobby to congress.

If he owed $0 and was eventually able to prove he submitted his taxes, it means the IRS lost the paperwork and/or never imputed it into its system.
