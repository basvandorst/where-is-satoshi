What evidence do you have that this is true everything that i have seen has shown that ethereum mining has been more centralised than bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:19:25
Doesnt sound secure until you try to get 1.11 million s9's

Couldnt one trawl bitcointalk and make a even worse list for cryptos.

i believe there was a article on mining with old samsung S5's

You could you know not be stupid as shit and ask people that know what they are doing on a cool platform that allows people to discuss things i think its called reddit or maybe discord  or maybe bitcointalk. I wish they made something like that it would be really cool.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:50:27
Yea no thats not true 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:18:10
I mean there are these people in the bitcoin community that aren't pieces of shit and tend to try and help new people in the community. Not sure if you know many of them but if you open your eyes you might see one or two.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:46:30
Yea more like 160 to 170

Algorithms like cryptonight bring in profit
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:01:47
I guess you havent but in most cases entire miners will never break down its usually specific hashboards that will break and are easily fixable if you know what your doing
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:56:34
You havent mined before have you
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:08:04
Show me proof
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:17:53
Well in the way you stated it I got that you were suggesting that mining equipment was unreliable and most gear breaks down. I think its fine to say investing is better but you cant really talk about anything other than ROI numbers unless you have experience with dealing with mining units.
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:02:57
Well if the math is correct yes
@_date: 2018-03-07 01:30:28
Welll i mean they could look at your address
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:44:25
Thats a pretty terrible way to look at it because a lot of wallets are old and no longer in use
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:54:44
Ponzis require operators bitcoin doesnt have a central operator.

Leverage is fine if your doing it safely. Trade less than 5x leverage. Move to larger leverage when the price action moves heavily in your favour.

I smell a lawsuit and it smells good
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:32:06
Or most people will move to other sites like bittrex that keep thwir shitboxes open
