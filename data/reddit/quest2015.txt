Here is a copy of the response I got from Jaxx support. Almost laughable that they call themselves support.
Hi there,
I have looked over the discussion chain below and I understand what happened with your Jaxx. This is one of those situations where unfortunately we do not know what happened to the wallet on your phone.
Please know that all security is localized on the devices Jaxx is installed on exclusively. There is no security information stored on any server and we do not have access to any security information. Moreover, Jaxx is not designed to send transactions on its own and all transactions sent from the Jaxx wallet need to be signed in order to be accepted by the blockchain, therefore that OUT transaction could have been sent only from the Wallet you have activated or by using the 12 word Backup Phrase in another (compatible) wallet. Jaxx did not send that transaction in error or by itself. Technically that is impossible.
I understand that this is not a desired situation but once a transaction has been accepted by the blockchain, it is irreversible. Maybe you can follow the transaction and see if it reaches an exchange that can freeze it and return it to you or made it was a transaction sent by mistake and the recipient will acknowledge that and send it back.
I'm sorry we cannot be of more assistance here but there really isn't anything we can do in your case.
Thank you, Andrei Jaxx Customer Success Team Andrei

I lost ethereum in Jaxx. Their support is no help. They tell me they don't know where my eth went. Is that an acceptable answer for someone selling their product as secure storage?

2 weeks after  lost my ethereum, their idea of support is Blame the customer and my device. All my other apps are secure on my device Jaxx is the  of wallets. Unapologetic or helpful for losing my Ethereum and being defensive while slapping customers around
