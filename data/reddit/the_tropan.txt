Why do people use untrusted/unverified sites to give money. Seriously.

Doesn't work fine for you, works fine for me.
Have you tried turning it off and in again?

You said it was easier to get bitcoin, it is not.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:19:22
Nice line, 2nd grade?
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:25:45
Works fine for me.

18,700 currently. Didn't take long ;)
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:16:01
But it's not a scam....just like buying gold, you will never get the 'spot price, it'll be higher because the seller is making money as well.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:57:53
Coinbase was very easy to setup, no issues. Really recommend them, so far everything haas been straight forward and easily navigatable. Support takes awhile but of course they are inundated with requests now from new entrants.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:23:48
That was a very nice presentation of what many people find hard to understand. Well done!
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:11:01
Looks like you'll be HODL'ing for a long while. Grats.

Stop buying coin every day? Most banks allow a certain amount of transactions/transfers per month without any fees, just plan around those. Mine is 5 I think, I only use 1-2 a month though. Buy in bulk ;)

How do you know they haven't sold 100 of these files for $10 a pop?
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:24:43
Reliable, but since they have had a massive influx of new accounts they are experiencing problems with verification and answering account related issues in a timely manner.

Be verifiable then, probably underage or submitted fake credentials

What are you gonna do with $5 in btc, cause it's ain't going to the moon. Maybe the corner store.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:33:13
Just bought more 
Buy those lows, cause you know its going up, like it continues to do, despite shortterm
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:52:49

Like owning some Stock in gold? Then the stock, except no paper, all digital. Again, it would be much more risky keeping it near me physically than keeping it in the ether, personally, for me.

There's this seemingly nice Nigerian prince who can bail you out, just needs some initial cash to process assistance.

According to their faqs, 2% is kept in exchanges, 98% is kept offline.
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:54:32
Coinbase is the easiest way in, very user friendly.
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:18:28
98% of customer funds are stored offline
Offline storage provides an important security measure against theft or loss. 
We distribute bitcoin geographically in safe deposit boxes and vaults around the world.
Sensitive data that would normally reside on our servers is disconnected entirely from the internet.
Data is then split with redundancy, AES-256 encrypted, and copied to FIPS-140 USB drives and paper backups.
Drives and paper backups are distributed geographically in safe deposit boxes and vaults around the world.
Then additional insurance for the online funds, seems safer then under my bed.... haha, joking aside I respect anyone who wants to 100% control their coin, I just think that above plan is safer then what I feel I could do.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:37:59
Hole in the backyard.
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:46:45
True, took me too long to get into the market. Glad I finally made a first purchase, start small and it will grow! Or crash. Hah.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:36:16
Wow yea, bad odds there!
@_date: 2019-04-02 21:16:40
I locked my car keys in my running vehicle at 3am on a Sunday, most roads closed in january. Now that was a disaster which impacted me, and similar disasters much more likely then coinbase losing my shit. 
I lean towards big crypto theft being a Plane Crash, and individual losing their own crypto as a Car Crash. Plane always receives more attention but is a lot more unlikely.
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:13:41
If I could, I would. 
I cant, for reasons, so I won't 
Can you?
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:43:53
The chances of Coinbase losing my investment is less then the chance of ME losing my hardware, key, or having some shit accident that destroys my property. Just saying. I am a lot less reliable I think.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:30:03
And how many people have lost their personal cold storage? Thousands, or more I am sure.
I would be one of those, I understand the risk of an exchange possible losing my investment, but trust them more then myself. How many millions have lost their SSN, a small piece of paper with a few digits, that's me. Haha.

Yea..let's see this answered.
Why is this time any different from other tech becoming obsolete. By your logic BTC should have experienced this when gpu's took over, or the others later on.

Simplest and fastest maybe, definitely not the safest though. Highly volatile, relying on public adoption. I agree though, can out you into a new financial tier if you have enough early on.
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:48:28
And a bitch ain't one.
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:14:24
Just buy and get it over with, first purchase is always the hardest. Don't even worry about the price, make smaller purchases if you want, maybe it goes higher, maybe it dips, smaller purchases will help balance the cost.
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:02:46
I dont think any place buys blood, plasma yes. Could be wrong though, didnt google this time
