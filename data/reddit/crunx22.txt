Honestly no idea what this sign was trying to tell me. It’s right next to the largest candy store in Minnesota that’s all yellow so ya? 
Seeing bitcoin in the wild up here is as rare as it gets tho.

That sounds terrible. I have yet to see an option for that. I’m guessing this only applies to the model T?

My understanding the “25th” word was the passphrase? 
Mine is not one word tho.
@_date: 2019-11-24 17:16:25
Yes. Pin and “25th” seed word. Aka passphrase. It really isn’t that bad. Mine is very odd so it’s easy to remember.

I’d say the keylogger has been the only true fear of mine. Any tips on how to mitigate the threat?

I do not think the wallet will be your issue, but how to access btc because of kyc. Idk maybe I’m wrong..
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:51:13
Trezor and enable passphrase. This is a should be mandatory.

Going to target using your credit card and asking the store to keep it for when you come back.

To shreds you say?
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:35:28
I mean it’s free to check through their app? I get what your saying tho.

Mine would break in half.

Yet to see one in the wild.

When I was younger I would cash my pay checks at Walmart service counter. Always worked. Tried a different Walmart one day. Denied me service even tho I had my ID, gave them my social. Their algorithm said no and there was no way around it. This also made it impossible to cash my checks at the original Walmart id use....
