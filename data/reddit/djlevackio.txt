I get that - but it implies there is no value in a mined block other than to the transactions in it, which is just not true. Each mined block benefits the entire network.

Wow so you're apportioning the block reward only to the transactions in the block (rather than the whole network which benefits from every block! ). This is stupid.

I've had the XBT Provider (BIT XBT) ETN in my Hargreaves Lansdown SIPP for a few MONTHS now. 2.5% charge from the fund and something like 0.04% from HL. Pretty happy with it, their treatment of the fork is a little u clear, seems they might sell the BCH in a few months if it's still worth anything and return the funds to us.   A little concerned if I HODL for 25yrs I'll be over the £1m SIPP limit on this one alone (nice problem to have I guess!)

Yes I did exactly this - no problems except you'll have a bigger transaction size (more inputs) when you sweep it.

@_date: 2017-08-23 10:51:44
You'd still have the private keys to your BTC wallet and could write your current channel balance to the blockchain whenever you wished - I'm just saying you probably wouldn't have to!

By the time fees are $1k I'd imagine your source of income (e.g salary/UBI)  will be via Lightning/some other off-chain solution, so setting up a channel will be a very rare event.

You lot are ridiculous. If you had 0.1% understanding of what a software life cycle looks like.... 
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:33:49
Here's my take...it REALLY depends on the rest of your circumstances. If you're 49yr, single, healthy, mortgage-free then I'd say it's probably worth the punt. Worst case you lose the lot and get £20k instead of £25k tax-free when you're 55 and you'll probably have to work on to state pension age. Best case we get 5 or 6 doublings from here and you're looking at being a millionaire. It's a punt, but a reasonable one if you believe in the technology.
If, on the other hand you're married/kids/mortgage....I'd probably think again about the percentages.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:09:16
I would say you're probably not far wrong. I think we might pass through it 4/5 times though before we're away. 2999 seems a long time ago now, doesn't it? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:13:12

@_date: 2017-08-22 20:35:00
So we have a ton of variables to deal with here but lets try to break them down, I'm also going to assume you're after something along the lines of Financial Independence (see i.e. not *having* to work. 
- Annual spending requirement
- Increase in BTC spending power vs USD
- Selling all BTC when 'target' is reached (in reality I expect that if you *can* sell your BTC to retire you won't *need* to)
So, let's assume in your retirement you have an annual spending requirement of $50k in todays money. The folks over at will tell you you can 'safely' withdraw 3% of your pot each year and it's statistically unlikely to ever run out. So we need $50k * 33.3 = $1,655,000 'buying power', in today's money, to retire. At which point we cash in all our BTC for USD and put it into 'safe' bonds/S&amp;P 500 (yeh, right!)
So, to retire on Crypto today you need $1,655,000/$4,000 = 413.75BTC
But, the 'buying power' of BTC is increasing all the time (price vs USD is going up) so we can start trying to calculate some scenarios.
Let's say BTC buying power increases by 50% each year vs USD (probably conservative), and USD inflation is 4% (probably pessimistic).
Here are the number of BTC you need to be holding each year to retire: 
    Year	BTC	                $/BTC	        Total
    1	     286.8666667	$6,000.00	        $1,721,200.00
    2	     198.8942222	$9,000.00	        $1,790,048.00
    3	     137.8999941	$13,500.00	$1,861,649.92
    4	     95.61066256	$20,250.00	$1,936,115.92
    5	     66.29005937	$30,375.00	$2,013,560.55
    6	     45.96110783	$45,562.50	$2,094,102.98
    7	     31.8663681	       $68,343.75	$2,177,867.09
    8	     22.09401521	$102,515.63	$2,264,981.78
    9	     15.31851722	$153,773.44	$2,355,581.05 
    10	10.6208386	$230,660.16	$2,449,804.29
    11	7.363781431	$345,990.23	$2,547,796.46
    12	5.105555126	$518,985.35	$2,649,708.32
    13	3.539851554	$778,478.03	$2,755,696.65
    14	2.454297077	$1,167,717.04	$2,865,924.52
    15	1.701645974	$1,751,575.56	$2,980,561.50
    16	1.179807875	$2,627,363.34	$3,099,783.96
    17	0.8180001267	$3,941,045.01	$3,223,775.32
    18	0.5671467545	$5,911,567.52	$3,352,726.33
    19	0.3932217498	$8,867,351.28	$3,486,835.39
    20	0.2726337465	$13,301,026.92	$3,626,308.80
In other words, if you think my assumptions are valid you could probably retire at 50 yrs old for an investment of under $5k today.
I'd say theres a good chance it will happen much, much quicker. If we double vs USD each year from here we're talking 1.15 BTC to retire in 9 yrs time!
But who knows though, hey? I wouldn't pin your hopes on it, but I'm stocking up just in case!

I'm not sure they'd need to open/close daily? But, presumably about the same as any other on-chain transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:17:44
I've found a way to do this....
1- Add a new sheet to the file you are using, call it 'API' and paste the following into cell A1
 
2- Find the cell that contains the value you want (in my case it's GBP Sell so D11)
3- On the sheet where you want to use the value use:
=REGEXEXTRACT(API!D11,".* : (.*)")
(substitute D11 for the cell that has the value you want)
Let me know how you get on!
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:36:06

Transaction fee is there in 'network' (999 satoshi/kW) so I guess it'll be transparant. Not sure what you mean by traceability? The point is these transactions are off chain but you should be able to see everything out (and through, if you're a node)
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:59:40
That one was a very small amount, but I've had more in the last few months. In this for the long haul now! 
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:50:51
Of course there will be corrections on the way, it won't be a straight line (and I have no basis other than my belief that we're only just getting started here, the last 8 years were the warm-up)
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:06:17
Deep breaths, and remembering why you invested in the first place. As long as you didn't invest more than you can afford to lose, and don't need the money for 3-5yrs you'll be fine!

Not far off. I suspect we'll see this in September. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:13:15
Here's my rough plan for if I ever get in this...err...'problem'
- Realise my CGT allowance each year once that's under ~10% of my holdings (i.e. £100-150k)
- Once I've made 'enough' to retire (£1m-2,m should do it), take out a SALT loan or some other Crypto-backed loan for as much as I'm going to need to survive for 5 years.
- Leave the country to some non-CGT place for 5 years.
- Realise ALL of my gains, once I'm not liable for UK CGT
- Move back to UK (maybe!) and buy a load of the BTC back again. 
- Live a happy retirement. 
I also have some BTC in my SIPP (via the XBT Provider fund) so I can get 25% of that tax free, in about 25 years.
We'll see....!
EDIT:  looks like I'm going to Belgium, Netherlands, Hong Kong or Singapore.
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:47:10
Had this about 2 weeks ago - stayed down for a few days then +30%. We'll be pushing $6k in the middle of September if the pattern repeats.

What's the general consensus on XBT Provider? I've had a couple £k with the for a month or so as I can invest through my SIPP (pension). That's money I'm not going to see for 25 years so I figured at least some of it should have Bitcoin exposure! 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:07:01
No I think you've got that the wrong way around - if they'd shorted anywhere UNDER current price (i.e $2k a couple of weeks ago) they'd be in trouble!

@_date: 2017-07-30 17:22:39
Shorting, or short-selling of anything (not just Bitcoin) is selling units you don't own. So in effect you borrow Bitcoin and immediately sell it, with the hope that the price goes down, so you can buy back at less that you sold at and return them. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:32:55
It would be tax evasion and you'd be prosecuted.
