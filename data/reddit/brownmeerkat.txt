Jup! It's a though one! I believe it will go back up 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:39:32
I am totally agreeing with you! I think Coinbase worked hard to get this working and implemented it even earlier than they said they should do (1 January).

@_date: 2017-08-05 05:54:00
Wait at least until 2020 for selling 
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:06:18
I think 3000,- is the new standard for now.

BTC could be anonymous. But then you need to buy a gift card with cash in the store. Put your gift card on a PayPal account with an account created through VPN/Proxy and secure email like Protonmail. This to avoid IP tracking and things like that

Thanks for letting me know.

Do you know why?

You can buy Bitcoin's and other coins already. I don't think Coinbase as an example will go down in the near future. I always have some coins on exchanges for fast buying and selling. And the rest on my Ledger for the long run.
I find it hard to decide where to keep my passphrase :P Because IF the house burns down (worst case) you lose your coins.

Dip how much? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:10:53
I see what you did there! 
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:07:31
What if say ledger is stopping there service and not supporting there system and don't sell hardware anymore. Can I still use my passphrase to recover my coins with or without a ledger? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:37:00
3380+ :D
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:38:15
Don't look at it for short period. Look at it in the long-term. I believe in 2020 it will be worth way more than today
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:46:01
I also had some coins on btce. And I never got any direct email from them. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:50:07
I also think it will dip a little but maybe after February.. Not sure at this point. I hope it will, then I can stock up on more coins :) 
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:26:05
Yeah, I think it would be good for a month. Then put it on your Ledger. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:05:05
You are never too late the buy Bitcoin. I believe it will one day hit 4000+
!RemindMe 365 days
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:55:01
I think I would go with Monero
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:59:30
Few more years... And will hit 10k. Gut feeling 
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:38:16
Buy some and keep it. The only thing I think you should invest some time in, are the hardware wallets and private keys.
If you have your coins at an exchange and something happens to that exchange you lose your coins because they own your private key. 
You should always own your private key! And NEVER share it with anyone!!!
Good hardware wallets are the wallets from Ledger. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:53:21
You are right! I have learned something from you thanks mate! I mean correction instead of crash. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:51:46
Hahahaha! I like that you draw it by hand! 
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:43:00
Best explanation ever! Thanks alot! :) will be using it too if that's ok! :) 
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:41:34
Will !RemindMe give you a personal message on that date??
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:32:07
Sweet! I have an app called coin tick for mac, show the rate in the top bar 
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:31:11
Wel said sir
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:50:02
It's rising! And will be THE new currency 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:53:11
Interesting theory, could you explain 
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:47:36
Should have bought previous week :p
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:27:47
They will be shipped end of September I saw. And shipping took for me after the shipping date about a week. 
One more little advice, the ledger will create a 24 word passphrase, this is to recover your coins after you lose you ledger or anything happens. Keep this save and on paper, never on an computer. And never share it with anyone! 
Good luck man! :) 
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:43:59

Just hold the coins, and don't look every day at the charts it will make you crazy I think. 
I try not to let my emotions play a game in this because you are more likely going to panic sell or buy high and sell low.
I buy every month an x amount of cryptocurrency.
Some Bitcoin, Some ETH, Some LTC, and some coin that is new.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:56:06
Why buy every day? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:55:31
I agree, the only thing I do differently is not buying with coinbase. The fees are waaay too high! 
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:01:38
I like to see more posts about the technology and possibilities instead of the price posts.. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:52:04
I think this is how you should feel if you lose with BTC, it's hard! But it means that you invested money you can lose. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:30:45
Death! It's death! 
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:14:39

@_date: 2017-09-29 06:44:08
I just added my info through coinbase and it was all fixed at GDAX 
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:48:01
I would also like to see more bitcoin technology posts 
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:59:59
He is just giving advice and his opinion I think. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:37:03
Yup :) this is an interesting point.
I think this is a good thing, Bitcoin is getting rarer over time!!! means better price ;)
It's not even if people lost their coins. I have some left coins on bitgo wallet (worth $0.20) and can't get it off because the value is too low.. So those coins are also 'lost'.
Same when people mine for a will inside of a pool and never withdraw there earned coins.
