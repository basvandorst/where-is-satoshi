I've been sending BTC past few week within recommended fee size (~25 cents/transaction) and it never took more than a minute for a full confirmation. 
For some unknown reason people are fine with % of transaction fee but cannot accept a universal fee for BTC.

Tesla may also be within your reach in few years even if you are just starting out. BT has crazy potential.

Don't get discouraged, some take skepticism especially hard due to their own stake, it's always been like that. I think you've stepped into early adopters roller coaster thinking it'll be a steady safe climb: index fund investment with HYIP like returns, how incredible. But reality was too stressful and you opted out. I respect that. Who know, maybe in few years you'll be laughing at all of us when it finally fails spectacularly or woefully telling stories about what you did today.

Keep in mind that typically, Exchange Commission takes 45 days to approve a measure but with XBTC they've been pushing it ever since mid-June. By law they can take no more that 240-days (with extension) and it all ends in 3 months. Certainly wouldn't hold my breath but hopefully. 
Regarding ETFs, without going into details, being approved by regulatory body will bring a sense of legitimacy to a whole BTC market and also grant an easy access for fund managers.
