Sorry to hear about your experience. I'm sure many of us on this sub can relate. It is exactly these types of shenanigans that will be the final downfall of government-regulated monies.

It's a new form of money that, by its design, can't be controlled or influenced by a government. For the first time, people are able to conduct business and transact directly with each other. All other methods of payment are government-sanctioned, meaning that you must have their permission to conduct your business. 
With Bitcoin, there is no third party. The entire system is built in such a way that it is, at the present moment, extremely difficult if not impossible to influence it, like the US government can just decide to print boatloads of cash. 
The power is with the people now

Gold is a physical asset. It is bound to the rules of the physical world. Bitcoin exists only on the Internet.
The only thing that could cause a serious disturbance in the Bitcoin network is something like a cataclysmic asteroid crash, nuclear war, anything that would destroy a massive chunk of computers hooked up to the Internet. Of course, if Doomsday really comes down upon us, it is the fiat currencies that will go first as they are controlled by governments.

Coinbase has a $40 USD daily instant-buy limit. I've been maxing it out every day for a week and my limits have yet to be raised.

Killing + restarting the app was the first thing I tried, the first time I ran into this problem. It does not seem to have any effect on the issue. Like I said in my OP, after the most recent update, the bug vanished and breadwallet worked flawlessly for several days until the bug just recently reappeared.
@_date: 2016-06-30 05:58:40
I don't understand your post at all.... Fuck legislation... Bitcoin is out of everyone's jurisdiction..Bitcoin will never die.... HODL

"Know Your Customer" and "Anti-Money Laundering". They are similar sets of regulations that are supposed to make money laundering more difficult to accomplish.

Can you comment on breadwallet's recent slow sync issues? Sitting here trying to open my wallet and it's taking 40 minutes to sync.

Yo my Google account was also recently accessed from the Philippines, and I live in the US... Makes me second guess Coinbase...

He laid the foundation for a system that has yet to find it's perfect place in our present world. Either it, or we must change in some form to adopt it successfully. 
The lack of present integration is not a fault of Bitcoin. This is how progress works.

Nah not crazy... Wider adoption means more amateurs... People here asking if they should sell when btc drops 40 $ lol...

Thank you for clearing that up for me, I appreciate it. I'll definitely stick with Breadwallet since it's not an issue in the application itself.

I think we conversed in a previous thread- my wallet is taking up to an hour to sync. I was recommended to email Breadwallet support about my issue but the reply essentially just said "we couldn't replicate the issue".
I do believe Breadwallet is a great app- I used it for many months with 0 issues. But the fact remains that it's become literally unusable for me because I can't wait 40-60 minutes every time I want to perform a transaction.
Moved half my coins to Airbitz this morning, out of curiosity just now reinstalled Breadwallet and it works fine? I accept the possibility that it is a local issue, on my end only, but how can that be if this happened to me on two different devices?
I won't jump ship from Breadwallet just yet... Hopefully whatever this bug is, it resolves itself, because Breadwallet was always my favorite wallet.

Using localbitcoins will allow you to avoid any paper trail. This is the best way to obtain btc if your cash is dirty. For legit funds, you can use Circle or Coinbase- just be aware that both require identity verification. ID scans, personal info, etc
@_date: 2016-07-06 04:56:54

You need to give up more personal info
Or use localbitcoins to avoid the paper trail

It doesn't matter if bitcoin's value in fiat soars. If Bitcoin performs the way it is intended to, the total value of it to humanity is far greater than your own personal &amp; financial gain 
@_date: 2016-07-02 12:11:13
Most of the people in my life are unfortunately too mentally and financially invested in the current reigning system to believe a word I say about Bitcoin, or its potential to overturn everything. 
Arguing with fools gets nothing done. The people who will see the light, will come to it on their own.

Make a paper wallet, print off multiple copies, bury/hide/conceal them in various locations. The failure of such a system is unlikely except in the case of something like a nuclear blast.
