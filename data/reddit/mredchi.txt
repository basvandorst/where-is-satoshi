If you are interested indeed, I would try dollar cost averaging instead. There is no way to know where the bottom will be.

Is this story for real? It's so easy to say anything you want on reddit without any proof..

Adam Back is Satoshi, so he already has 1 million bitcoins. The only thing he has to do going forward is to make sure bitcoin survives and prevails vs. all the other copycats.

Nobody was willing to sell their bitcoins for below $400. So the price had to rise. And once it starts rising, momentum starts picking up and more traders come in and keep buying.
@_date: 2014-05-20 02:14:41
It's a bitcoin bank. You deposit your bitcoins (so you don't really own them anymore) and they force you to give a way your privacy. Makes no sense to me. YOU should own your bitcoins, not THEM.
Avoid at all costs!
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:09:33
I don't think bitcoin is a currency. It's just too volatile to become a currency and it will remain volatile for a long time. Possibly as long as it exists.
I see bitcoin as e-gold instead, still useful, but not a currency. Gold is still very volatile, thousands of years after its introduction but people still want to own gold.

this would be very underpriced at the moment. I think fair price would be closer to $300-500 or so..

If you buy right now you probably won't make VC profits. If you bought in 2012, then maybe.

I feel this is a niche product. Most people don't care that much about strong anonymity, judging by how many people are still using gmail, facebook, etc..
On top of that, the extreme complexity of zerocash limits further it's potential.
A simpler way to achieve increased anonymity (if you really want to) would be through some existing bitcoin wallet that would allow you to have that option, not through a new altcoin.

The problem is that you don't know if it will go up or down. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:11:37
Agree. VCs and investors will keep supporting bitcoin. At the same time, more and more developers are jumping in with new and exciting ideas. Hard to bet against those 2 trends.

This looks so complicated and almost impossible to read, unless you have a PhD in cryptography.
Implementing this system efficiently and without bugs could take a long time. The number of people who can contribute to the project will be very limited due to its complexity IMO.
Also, at this point, most people are incentivized to build apps on top of bitcoin given bitcoin's more straightforward APIs and recent major publicity.
@_date: 2014-05-10 02:24:14
Why care that much? Are you Satoshi?
@_date: 2014-05-20 02:11:34
The only way they can beat visa is by allowing people to pay with dollars, not bitcoin.
Bitcoin needs to be invisible for the user and just work in the background.
Why would I want to spend my bitcoins if I think that pretty soon they will worth 10x or 100x?
Makes no sense to me.
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:43:01
amazing, great design!
@_date: 2014-05-26 00:59:53
if this works, then why pay $560 for 1 bitcoin, when you could transfer $100 with 1 satoshi?

Thank you China! Now we can buy bitcoin so much cheaper!
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:37:32
This is great news. Let's all hope the price drops too at all the other exchanges so we can buy more..
@_date: 2014-05-16 20:43:50
Here are a few ways:
* The owners hold a significant amount of bitcoins themselves. If bitcoin gets adopted as a result of their service, these holdings will go up in value a lot.
* From an IPO. They can be unprofitable for 5-10 years, but they can still do a billion dollar IPO with the hope that they will "figure out the monetization model eventually".
* Google buys them and integrates their service with Google wallet. This makes total sense, since now Google will not only own all your data, but all your money as well!
* From the bitcoin to dollar trading spread (probably not that much)
* They can sell your personal data to other financial firms, since you are not guaranteed any privacy by using their wallet.
* Maybe they are secretly funded by the NSA. The NSA would love to know who owns all these bitcoin addresses and how money moves around.
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:23:37
In that case, buy even more?
@_date: 2014-05-22 06:21:38
Everyone is expecting a 10-20x return on bitcoin, which makes me worried. Hard to believe it's THAT easy to make so much money. The same people were the ones expecting the DOW to reach 36000, gold to reach 5000, etc..
Don't get super greedy.

This type of censorship would be the last thing you would expect from fans of bitcoin. Following the same logic you should have banned all the "to the moon" posts and memes historically. This is just wrong.
