Fwiw they integrated Spotify and accept payment in Amex points. Pretty aggressive development, so maybe! Plus there's a Braintree connection.

Do some studying before buying. Coinbase.com and circle.com are reputable, but if you buy a significant amount be sure to understand the concept of and reasons to use **cold storage**.

Your instincts about bitcoin are good, but keep in mind it's probably going to take 10 *more* years for the market to develop. $600 is kind of an unfortunate price. I don't think anyone can successfully argue that late 2013 wasn't a bubble.

I suppose an IRA can obviously hold an ETF but now I'm wondering if a self-directed IRA can directly hold bitcoin.

The smallest possible pledge is 0.175 BTC due to limitations of the bitcoin protocol. See the Lighthouse FAQ for further explainations.
Lighthouse FAQ:
Why is there a limit on how many pledges I can collect? Why is there a minimum pledge size?
Currently you cannot accept more than 684 pledges for your project. This is due to limitations in the Bitcoin protocol - the final contract that claims the pledges is a single Bitcoin transaction, and thus is limited to 500 kilobytes by the Bitcoin block size and protocol relay rules. Lighthouse therefore enforces a minimum pledge size of whatever the goal amount is, divided by the max number of pledges. The more you try and raise, the larger the minimum buy-in becomes.

Just based on the trend and sentiment, I think we'll see &lt; $150 again.

Isn't the issue here that there's probably no easy btc--&gt;local currency exchange? It's either that or widespread btc acceptance.

The ETF will charge a continuous % fee. Not worth it unless  desperate for exposure to the price or perhaps for an IRA.
"... an IRA can legally own real estate and a lot of other alternative investments, too, ranging from private equity and promissory notes to gold, oil and gas and cattle."

Andy Kessler made a ton of money with a sweetly timed hedge fund exit in the 90's tech bubble. If I remember correctly they just said "we're out" and returned everyone's money.

This is kinda cynical. Plenty of people are attracted to the design of the system from an engineering perspective, its interesting use cases, etc. It just happens to be money as well.

I saw the talk on this in person and couldn't understand most of what he was describing. I came away thinking that he knows Ethereum might not scale and is digging for solutions. Maybe it's just over my head though.
