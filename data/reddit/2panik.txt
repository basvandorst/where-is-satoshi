Look at this link at exchanges:
Binance is there with 369 million USDT.
Now let's say from some reason USDT is no longer $1, now is $0.60. Everyone will want to sell and get a peice of what is left from that value.
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:09:44
All major exchanges use USDT. All buy orders on them are USDT.
If USDT is zero then most buy orders are gone so price of BTC will go down very hard.

How much money do they want to transfer in your bank account? That is the money laundering you are doing for them... If this thing is real, and not a scam. 
The loophole of money transfers ends with you buying bitcoin for them. They will transfer dirty money through your bank account, and you are willing to accept for a cut... If this is real, and not some method of stealing your money.

2008 financial crisis has push someone to create this transparent yet secure network, were you can exchange property, unrestricted in any way, but so transparent that financial authoritys can monitor the flow of money, but not control it in any way.
This is an ideal financial system, but won't happen until governments will start using this network as it's main monetary infrastructure.
And I'm not talking about using BTC as money.  I'm saying to add or convert satoshi to properties, like cars, houses, land... and money. Like an official country database of propertyes and who ones what,  but not being in control of this network at all.
But won't happen because Bitcoin didn't evolved enough. Is just a speculative asset.

I'm no expert on their history and practices either. But I don't understand how you cannot see Tether as the possible lone whale. If the tethers are unbacked, then who is the owner of the issued USDT's, if not Tether/Bitfinex itself. You don't think they print USDT and send them to random wallets, do you?
Now, if you are an exchange like Bitfinex (in our case, but who is to say they don't own many more exchanges) and you can print "money" to buy clients BTC, ETH, LTC, etc., you are now in possession of many many coins for **FREE.**
Now with the BTC that own, you are going to buy **from yourself (no fees)** ETH, pumimp the price up and you still have the same amount of coins, but more valuable. Now, what do you do with the ETH that you just pump? Buy other shitcoins… and so on. Do the same with LTC, ETC, XPR... you get the idea, you have a bull run, without any money involved.
Remember the USDT’s that your clients are left with? Not much they can do with them, other than buy other coins pumping the price again.


If Tether has the money, they can prove it with an audit.
@_date: 2019-11-15 04:04:05
You have to get through verification steps. I don't think there is any other way to access your funds.
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:58:17
Let's use fictional round numbers to make things simpler. Let's say 1 BTC is $500 at this moment; marketcap is $500 x 17,000,000 = $8,500,000,000 | $8.5 billions. (remember that market cap is a statistical value from the last price, not the liquid money on the BTC market; you won't sell 17,000,000 BTC for $500 each in this case)
So Bitfinex prints $50 millions and manages to buy from the market 70,000 BTC, rising the price of BTC on exchanges to $1000. Now the marketcap of BTC is $1000 x 17,000,000 = $17 billions. With $50 millions they manage to double the marketcap of BTC.
Next Bitfinex prints $50 million and buys ETH this time. ETH is valued at $1 each. Marketcap of ETH is $1 x 100,000,000 = $100,000,000 | $100 millions. They manage to buy 12,000,000 ETH rising the price at $3 = marketcap at $300 millions.
So, in that logic, they have 70,000 BTC valued at $70,000,000. Now they can buy from themselves, ETH from thows 12,000,000 ETH thay just bouth,  rising the price and marketcap of ETH even more. And after that, they can buy the same BTC with the same ETH, rising price and marketcap even more, without any money involved, just from the value of these 2 coins. You see where i'm going, hope you see why this marketcap is a massive massive bubble.

You won't find honest answers here. Bitcoin is like a gold standars replica and It won't be a currency because we won't go back in the middle ages.

You pay with your work and your work adds value to a currency.

Gold is the usual safe asset in a crash, mostly because banks are the hodlers and are more disciplined then the average Joe.

Why would a business complicate it's financial risk with cryptocurrency? Because of decentrlized nature, no one is going to undo a mistake, or a dispute. And Joe needs security and stability, not what is happening now. Be realistic, is not going to happen.
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:51:36
The idea is like this. You send a number (in our case Bitcoin) from A to B in an unhackable, transparent (anyone can see the transaction) and decentralised network (a collective replica of the same transaction record). 
It is not an investment because, having and holding Bitcoin doesn't produce anything in return. You can only send it to someone else.

You are confusing bitcoin with block. 
The miner who solves the math problem, gets to create a block. And he has the right to include in that block, from the memory pool (which contains the pending transactions) whatever transaction he wants ( but not all of them, in the limit size of 1mb). He takes the fees from those transaction, and because of that, the miner usually choses the transactions with the highest fees. 
Right now, there is a reward for the one who makes the block. 12,5 Bitcoins. But this reward will end, and miners will create blocks only for fees. But the Blockchain will continue to grow in Blocks until the last miner.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:24:04
How haven't I've seen that ;)
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:41:12
1. Rumors claiming the price has to rise. This helps speculative adoption and scares ordinare business that need stability.
2. Lightning is in early stages, yet to be proven then adopted - a long road. Blockchain transaction are to slow for real world scale. "Technological advances" are theoretical not practical, yet.
3. "the fact that buy order books are full at present" - OK.
4. "Because BTC is sound money, even with the manipulation " - yea sure, everyone adopts financial instability, right?
5. "stupid fuckers that sell to people with money at a loss."  so people are stupid because they bought or mined Bitcoin and they do whatever they please they their money?


Yes please.

@_date: 2019-01-09 19:29:59
Blocks are not "found". Blocks are created, and will be created if there are miners to mine. But they won't create new Bitcoins, miners will be rewarded only with the fees from transactions.

Yes you are right. Now let's imagine that mining becomes unprofitable in such a way, that half of miners, more or less, decide to start fresh with a new chain, not necessarily a fork. Will this scenario steal half of the value of original coin and transfer it to the new coin?

So from this perspective, who benefits most from hash power? the one how makes it. Is in his interest that bitcoin is valuable, so profitable to mine and use their tools. But, the one that makes the tools can also use his tools to: increase the difficulty, collect Bitcoins and in the end sell more products. Do you see where I'm going?


With that kind of profits they can also pump the price of Bitcoin.

I think is about a lot more. Trade war is taking place because Europe is still supporting Iran in that nuclear deal, that means economic advantages for Iran (and Europe) and capacity to sell a lot of oil to China. Iran is also supporting Siria. 
So, Europe and China is supporting Iran economy, which is supporting Siria and pissis off Israel and Saudi Arabia, which probably want to sell oil to China. Europe also wants Russian resources.
So USA and UK are doing what they can to make their threats to Europe and China with economic war, because they somehow support Iran and Russia economies, country's that are messing their  plan's with Siria.

OK, but as a business you don't store your bitcoin, you have resupply/spend and pay your employees.
