We just need to fork bitcoin wallstreet to a new coin Bitcoin Reborn and dump the top to buy the new coin like Wall Street does. then we have a new reborn coin that is ETF FREE. remember when the majority dumps a coin for another, the other one dies (see BCH demise)

Are there any negatives about switching from GBTC to CXBTF?
 \- it owns no bitcoin. It is merely a promise to track the price of bitcoin. Remember those VIX funds that went to zero when there was lots of volatility? Same thing can happen here  
\- it is supposed to be 1/200 of a bitcoin  
\- there is a very small premium over the underlying bitcoin but the spread between bid/ask is 3% which is very high  
\- there is almost no liquidity. GBTC volume is 30X higher  
\- there is an annual 2.5% fee which will cause a large decay over time. 
can anyone confirm?

Scandinavia has social elements, as does much of Europe and the US but you shouldn't describe their system as plainly "Socialism" that's simply not true it's a mixture of capitalism with social programs and that's the sweet spot a nation should aim for. Neither hypermonopolies nor pure socialism is any good.

Well, yes but what are you afraid of? A true EFT? That would make BTC itself double. So it doesn't mean GBTC would tank. I also don't like the premium but tax\-free is massive and it's the only current vehicle on US Stock market. There's the Swedish EFT of course BTX or something.

I believe you haven't understood bitcoin at all if you make this statement. Quantum computing is indeed "experimental" and at this point fictional. POW is there so that we **do** have security and decentralization. 
This whole quantum computing argument is pointless. It's a boogeyman people invent so that they can sell their FUD. And if it does become reality, bitcoin will adapt. And at that point all encryption would be broken so online banking and 90&amp; of what we do on the internet would be dead, we'd be back to herding goats. But you're worrying about POW? It doesn't make sense to me.

Americans don't want to use their 401ks or IRAs to buy BITCOIN and be stuck with the weirdest filings ever for the rest of their lives. That's why they want bitcoin EFTs that won't ask them to spend 2 months on their tax returns.

Because Bitcoin strives to be a currency whereas stocks do not.

Lots of people mate. There are many fiscally conservative people that put money into a savings account. That's even more so the case in countries like Germany where investing culture isn't as big as in the US where people tend to buy real estate or stocks. I hope you understand the comparison now.
