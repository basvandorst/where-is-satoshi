Best solution will most definitely be to send it to my 'secure' wallet secure :-)
On a serious note though, I personally will invest in a couple of hardware wallets and split the amount between them. Get yourself say 4 Trezors, make proper backups of the seed words and split the amount between them.
I don't think the 'wallet' and or method is that important as long as its 'secure'. More importantly will be the backup method used to ensure that you can always do a full and proper recovery.

From the information provided it does not seem like a Trezor would be at risk. From my understanding a Trezor receives a transaction and signs the transaction without revealing the private keys to the machine used to do the transaction. A Trezor is not and does not work like a usb drive. 
If you however make use of usb drives to copy signed transactions from an offline machine to an online machine then there might be risks involved as far as this malware is concerned as it is able to hide itself on usb drives.
The article however does not mention whether or not the malware could target wallets. I guess it could if one looks at what it was designed for.

If you sell it at the increased price then yes, you made $200. If you don't then you only made an unrealised profit meaning a profit which has not been realised yet.
If you are subject to capital gains tax in your country then yes, you will be subject to taxes on the increased value i.e. the capital gain.

The keys are not just stored in my head, as mentioned, there is a way to recover them from the available information and there are also steps in place in the event of both of us passing so that it can be recovered without our assistance but with the assistance of three other parties who each have a part of the puzzle.
If all else fails the loss will be big but it will only be around 15/20% of my wealth. First rule of 'investing' is to never invest more than you can afford to lose followed by never to put all your eggs in one basket. 
Bitcoin at this stage is still a very speculative investment, at best, so any 'investment' in bitcoin should be done with the knowledge that there is quite a big probability that there might be events which can result in the investment losing half and or all of its value.

Tested it for a couple of days but left it due to the large quantity of bandwidth it consumed. Not sure whether this has been fixed yet but sure something to keep your eye on should you make use of this wallet.

Trezor linked to Electrum on desktop and to MyCelium on mobile. Provides best security without affecting the ease of use and or accessibility of funds.

Have a Trezor and love it. It however seems, and this is just personal opinion, that other hardware wallets are advancing at a quicker pace than Trezor.
Where Trezor was always the leader or 'the' hardware wallet it now seems to be lagging behind others i.e. Ledger already has ETH integration, KeepKey which now incorporates ShapeShift etc..
Not included or mentioned here yet is the one from the guys of Jaxx, the IceCube (think that is what they called it). I think this is one to keep an eye on. The Jaxx wallet is already becoming a very popular wallet. Its fully cross-platform, does BTC, ETC, DASH and more to come. Now throw in a custom designed hardware wallet into that mix and you have a winning combination.
One of the major problems for me personally with Trezor is the fact that there are no wallets to support the coins that a Trezor can handle. There is a couple for BTC, Electrum-LTC for LTC but for all the others there is no software wallet that works with the Trezor resulting in you not being able to use those coins on the Trezor.

Glad I could help, they are apparently working on a desktop version and if not mistaken there is an iOS version in the works as well.
You might also want to keep an eye on Jaxx. Currently only supports BTC and ETC but Dash support is coming in the next week and Monero is also in the works with others to follow. Its cross platform so will run on iOS, Mac, Win, Linux, tablets etc.. It also works with a single seed.
A hardware wallet is also in the works which is planned for early next year.  Source code is also open source and has gone through a security audit a while back.
@_date: 2016-08-14 06:44:01
Have you looked at [Coinomi](
Its a multi-currency open source wallet and all wallets work from the same seed so just one seed to remember for multiple  wallets. It currently supports around 40 different coins.
@_date: 2016-08-20 10:51:02
The point I was trying to make was that if you have a Trezor that you are completely dependant on third party software in order to use the Trezor. So a Trezor on its own does not provide all the necessary 'tools' for the user to use the Trezor to its fullest.
In regards to DASH, yes it works but not if you are a Windows user. The Windows version of Electrum for DASH does not support Trezor. Apparently this has been sorted out but there is no official Windows build out, yet. So if you do not have the technical knowledge to build your own Windows release it means that you still cannot use Dash with Trezor on an Windows based system, so once again you are completely dependant on third parties to provide the necessary tools if you want use a Trezor to its fullest. Same with Doge, there is no Doge wallet that supports Trezor so no way to actually use Doge on a Trezor even though it 'supports' it.
The password manager mentioned was a great effort and I understand that we will see ongoing developments in that area. At present its a great concept but lacking in many ways when compared to other password managers. So much so that I've reverted back to Keepass as its just miles better and it works. So the password manager, in my opinion, is similar to the myTrezor site. It works and it might be great for most but its still lacking in many ways and does not provide all the necessary 'tools' to get the best out of a Trezor device.
There is no argument that a Trezor is one of the best hardware wallets but when compared to what others are doing and or offering I cannot help but feel that Trezor is slipping from its 'market leader' position. 
As said, just my personal opinion and we all know what they say about opinions.

Cannot remember the exact number but know it was quite a bit when  compared to other wallets. If not mistaken it was close to or over a 100MB while my Electrum wallet hardly used 5MB over the same period. I know the Electrum wallet is a single coin wallet so the bandwidth usage will be lower. 
I did make contact with you back then and think you mentioned that the number of servers Exodus connects to could be decreased which would result in lower bandwidth usage.
@_date: 2016-08-19 17:54:03
Nice to see the constant improvements and ongoing development. Jaxx has become my wallet of choice.
Still making use of Electrum though as I have a Trezor and at this stage Electrum is so to say the best companion for Trezor.
I'm however keeping all eyes and ears open for any news on the hardware wallet being planned/developed by you guys. The addition of a hardware wallet will complete the picture nicely.
@_date: 2016-08-28 11:52:58
Download the portable version. It comes as a single exe file. Create a folder on your USB drive i.e. Electrum, drop the exe file in there and run it. All Electrum files, including wallet files will be created in that same directory.
Once done copy your existing wallet file to the wallets folder created. You then have everything in a single folder and its portable.
Latest downloads can be found here, just look for the portable version

Agree, Electrum. Fast, easy, reliable.
@_date: 2016-04-03 09:21:46
Yes, when you get it there is nothing on it i.e. no keys. So the first thing you do when you get it is to generate a key pair on the device. Once done you will have the public key/address for the device and can then load as much as you want to onto it.
You cannot see the private key unless you break out the part on the board as indicated, only then will it display the private key. So the private key remains secret as long as the board is not broken.
What would have been very nice was if the board had a tiny battery and lcd display with a button one could press which will then display a balance on the lcd. In that way you can quickly confirm the balance on the device without the need for anything else i.e. plugging it into a pc/phone etc..

The 'fastest' faucets I know of is 
You can claim every minute so the total earned adds up quite quickly. There is also more faucets which pays to the same wallet at 
Some of them also pays every minute so if you hit all of them you can quickly get up in the 10's of thousand satoshi within around an hour or two. Not a fortune but will give you enough to play around with.
@_date: 2016-04-21 09:15:19
Also note that the fiat price being shown on Blockchain.info changes as the bitcoin price changes. So the price shown on the transaction will change the whole time. 
If you come back to it tomorrow it might show that $510 was transferred if the price of btc went up. If you move your mouse over the amount shown it will show you the price as at transaction time.

COMEX especially yes but it also applies to others. I'm speaking under correction but at present brokerages are only required to hold a certain percentage of the gold EFT's in actual gold. Not sure about the actual percentage but think its around 5 to 10%.
@_date: 2016-04-23 07:20:30
You may also want to look at BitMixer ( which is a high volume bitcoin mixing service. I have not used it myself but have seen some good feedback on their service. 
They basically swap your coins for somebody else's. Person A will send say 100 coins there and receive back 100 coins which was send to them by other people.
So if you for example send say 10 coins, they send you back 10 coins which belonged to somebody else. The next person who sends say 5 coins might then up getting 5 of the 10 you sent. By doing that they break the link.
See their website for a more detailed explanation.

That is correct yes but if you look at the picture of the Cryptosteel you will see that it only has place for 12 groups of 4 letters each. They say it can hold up to 96 letters so 24 x 4 but I only see place for 12 x 4 unless its in another layer.

Guess you meant **debit cards**, there are no credit cards I know off.
Of all the debit cards out there currently only two, AFAIK, are directly linked to your wallet namely Xapo and CoinsBank (Bit-X), forgot, think Shift/Coinbase as well. The others need to be preloaded.
None of these companies give you access to the private keys of their wallets. Best is to setup your own wallet on Electrum or similar and only transfer over what you plan on spending.
@_date: 2016-04-29 06:21:31

Zero. I doubt that they have forgotten their fiduciary duty and the transparency offered thus far are part and parcel of that duty.
Agree, they might have taken longer than some might have anticipated but as far as I know they are busy with a complete forensic audit on all funds and that might be part of the delay in getting refunds out.
At least everybody is kept up to date on what is taking place which is far better than other instances where no information whatsoever were forthcoming.

I've looked at BSave and like the idea of earning interest on any btc not in 'use'. There's however one problem and that is one of trust. Do you trust this company enough to put your 'nest egg' with them in the hope that it will stay safe and grow in months/years to come?
You have no control over your coins once sent to them meaning you do not control the wallet and or private keys. Yes you can withdraw at anytime but that is dependant on them processing such a withdrawal. If they close shop and disappear in the night so will your 'nest egg'.
One of the first lessons I learned with bitcoin was that if you do not own/control the private key(s) you do not own/control the coins.

@_date: 2016-04-23 15:20:46
Remember the golden rule:
If you do not own/control the private keys of the wallet then you do not own/control the coins within that wallet.
At Xapo you do not have any control over the private keys so you effectively do not own the coins on that wallet. If Xapo goes down so does your coins with them. So only keep the minimum required on that wallet.
Personally also have a Xapo wallet and debit card but I only transfer what I need for card purposes to my Xapo wallet. Rest of my coins are held offline on a Trezor.
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:53:34
The steps given has worked fine for me before without any problems. All I can think is that it must have something to do with the format of the keys, maybe Electrum does not accept the format you have.

I know all 24 seed word of my Trezor by heart and so does my significant other. This also applies to the pin and the passwords used. 
Additionally we also did the following as an additional layer of security as well as a means of recovery.
Firstly, I selected one of the books we have in the house. Its quite a common book which you are bound to find in almost any book store.
I then looked up words matching the seed words and those used in the passwords, took a while but managed to find all of them eventually. We then recorded these words as follows: 5-18|20-9|32-7 etc.. Meaning page 5, word 18, page 20 word 9 etc...
This string of 'code' (5-18|20-9 etc) was then written down and a couple of copies are kept in safe places. One copy was also engraved on a piece of aluminium which is kept in the safe. By itself this string of 'code' means very little unless you know that it was taken from a book and if you know that you still need to know which book.
 
Maybe overkill but the fact is that we have a means to recover the seed words without keeping the actual seed words in a 'readable' form and without having to rely on any electronic forms of encryption and or storage which might fail when most needed.

So at this stage I will not recommend that you download it until the final release is out, its a waste of time.
@_date: 2016-04-21 16:07:39
Nice thing about Electrum, for me personally, is that they release a stand-alone version. A single exe file. You can drop that in a folder on a USB drive and it will create all the necessary folders and files in that same folder. You can then use that usb drive on any other pc and have all the required files at hand.
**WARNING:** If you use that usb drive on an infected computer you might compromise your wallet and lose everything. So do not just slot that drive into any other pc unless you know you can trust that pc and even then, think twice.
I use Electrum with a Trezor so my Electrum setup is a watch-only wallet so nothing to compromise except for maybe privacy.

Just a note from personal experience.
I tried to buy bitcoins with paypal when I started out. The transaction was sent as a 'Friends &amp; family' type. I got scammed i.e. never received the coins. I reported this to paypal and after waiting days on end the investigation was closed and they refused to reverse the transaction.
Their reasoning was that it was a 'friends &amp; family' transaction so not a business transaction where I could claim I did not receive the goods. Fought with them for almost a month and eventually just gave up and closed my paypal account.
So be carefull with business type transactions as these can be reversed.

I do not think the 'sweep' function works as I could not get it to work either. I have however been able to import the private key(s) into electrum the same way you import the public key. 
So if you want a watch-only wallet you import the public key, if you want to access the funds then import the private key.
@_date: 2016-04-29 18:37:45
* File
* New/Restore
* Enter name for wallet
* Select 'Restore a wallet or import keys'
* Select 'Standard wallet'
* Enter/paste the private key and click next
So you follow the same steps you do when setting up a watch-only wallet but instead of importing the public key you import the **private key**.
This will create a standard wallet with the public address. You will be able to move any funds on that address as the private key is also in the wallet.
@_date: 2016-04-12 12:17:06
Not sure, I do however see that the sending address have quite a number of unconfirmed transactions. Maybe something with the wallet being used? As said, not sure.

Glad to hear they sorted you out, been with them for quite some time and only had two minor issues (which they sorted out quickly) so overall very happy with their service.

Been using Xapo for close on a year now and never had any problems. Nice thing about them is that the card is directly linked to your bitcoin wallet so no need to preload the card.
Also have a CoinBanks (Bit-x) card but have not used it in a while. They have a reward scheme where you get a certain amount of bits for every dollar you spend on the card. Fees basically similar to Xapo's.

If the card was directly link to your wallet then I might consider it. This card must also be preloaded and the loading can take up to a day before the funds are available on the card. These loadings are usually also subject to minimum loading amounts. 
Also, with most of these preloaded cards you cannot send funds back from the card to your wallet. Only way to get the funds out is to spend it or to withdraw it from an ATM.
With Xapo and CoinBanks (old Bit-X) the cards are directly linked to the wallet so no preloading required and no minimum loading amount. Fund will be available for card transactions the moment you have the required 6 or 3 confirmations (Xapo 6, CoinBanks 3).
There is also no worry to get funds off the card and back into your wallet as the funds are always in your wallet.
@_date: 2016-04-30 11:22:30
I'm speaking under correction but I doubt whether this can be done. In order to receive card payments you will have to signup with either a bank and or through one of the online card merchants which would mean no anonymity. In most cases you will also have to provide some form of account to them in order for them to payout your funds to you.

Also make use of a Trezor and also have all my btc on there. In addition I also make use of Electrum on which I have watch-only wallets setup.
I was thinking of getting another Trezor as a backup but do not really see the use as I can just enter the seed in Electrum and have access to all funds and the ability to move them should I lose my Trezor and or should it get damaged.
I guess one could split your holdings between two Trezors and keep only say 10% of your holding on a 'daily use' Trezor while the rest is on another Trezor which is kept locked in a safe. This will most probably be the way I will go in future as my holdings grow.

The one starting with the 3 is the Segwit address as already mentioned. 
There is also a Legacy wallet which will have your NON segwit addresses which starts with a 1.
The changing address is to prevent or discourage address reuse. If you give me an address to send funds I only know that one address of yours so I will only be able to look up any transactions to that specific address on a block explorer.
If you use a different address for each transaction it would mean that I will not be able to monitor your other transactions. If you however keep on using the same address then I will be able to monitor every transactions as I know the address.
So the changing address is to increase privacy.
The xpub address is your **MASTER PUBLIC KEY**.
If you enter the xpub key on some block explorers they can pickup all transactions related to your entire wallet i.e. on any of the addresses in your wallet.
For privacy reasons you should however be careful with the xpub key and not just share it with any site/person. Any person who know a single address/public key of your wallet will be able to see only transactions linked to that specific address. If that same person however know your xpub key they will be able to see any and all transactions in your wallet, no matter on which address the transaction happened.

1. Offers BTC, LTC, USD, GBP, EUR wallets (think there's more),
2. Wallets are directly linked to card i.e. funds can be held in BTC and will be converted at time of purchase,
3. You can link any or all wallets to the card and set the priority in which they should be used,
4. You get a cashback on all purchases made with the card,
5. Good mobile app,
6. Good security i.e. can block cards or set them only to work in a certain country or countries etc..

None as no information is provided. All it states is that the card will come preloaded with a certain amount but no information on exactly how much. Also that you can load the card in 20 days, guess that has to do with the upcoming ICO having to be completed first.
No further information i.e. how it works, the fees or anything else so no way one can give any opinion on the card.

2. Think you need to read a bit wider. Will see if I can find the article. Fact remains, if you do not understand the code behind it how can you know that you can trust it?

With e-Payments you can receive funds to your e-wallet through several different methods. From there you just move it to the card for free.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:52:44
You asked for an opinion and I gave it. You are using or plan on using encryption software that were shown to be full of flaws. Most of those **discovered** were fixed but as they say, some still remain unpatched. Also, how many remained undiscovered?
Question is how many flaws were not found? You know why TrueCrypt (from where VeraCrypt came) stopped? You know about their canary?
So again, you asked for an opinion and mine is that you cannot 100% fully trust the encryption software you plan on using and neither can you 100% fully trust the paper wallet generators.
If you are willing to risk your life savings on that then go for it.

Sorry to hear about your loss...bastards, as they say, there is a special place in hell reserved for these people.
Typical scam though, never ask for the funds, put the potential victim in such a position where he/she is the initiator of the transaction i.e get them to give you the funds without asking for it.

**Forgot to add**: You can use the xpub key (or could, not sure whether its still supported) on Electrum to make a watch-only wallet by only entering your xpub key. So no private keys and or seed is needed. 
A watch-only wallet is nice to have on an online computer as you can monitor any transaction without any risk of any private keys etc. getting hacked or stolen.
I'm sure there are other wallets where this can be done. I know Blockonomics, an online site that alerts you about transactions, used to let you enter a xpub key so your whole wallet could be monitored.

Just send funds to a new address each time, write the private key of that address down on a piece of paper, fold it up and drop it into an existing piggy bank.

Yes. Day trading involves more risk but it also results in higher returns. You might get a return of say 50% a year on your investment whereas a good trader can do that every week and or even couple of days if the market conditions are right. 
Also, not all traders are the same or rather they do not all use the same kind of strategy. Many are what's referred to as news traders who basically only trade during times of big news events. Others again trade on larger timeframes where they might only check their trades once a week or month while others might trade on the lower timeframes and they are usually not in a trade for more than a couple of minutes or hours. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 14:58:25
Very few traders actually make a profit and whatever they made will differ quite widely as it results will largely depend on their account balances as well as their individual risk appetites.
So telling you I made $100,000 actually means very little if it was made with a starting balance of say $10m.
Be careful if you plan on trading bitcoin. It's a very immature and unregulated market. Also, stay away from leverage as far as you can.
@_date: 2017-02-24 06:21:08
Doubt whether you will be able to sell that quantity without some kind of verification as well as initial limits being applied. 
Best bet in my opinion will be to increase your existing limits as you already have a history with them so the chances of getting increased limits is much better than if you go with somebody completly new.

Nobody thinks in 3 or 6 decimal places when it comes to currencies. Everybody has grown up with the current system which has 2 decimal places and because of that bits i.e. 100.00 instead of 0.0001 just makes more sense.

Agree, was just trying to point out that as it is now, it is already not viable for many of the world's 'poor' people OP referred to. So whether we stay on a 1MB block or not will have very little impact, we are already past the point where a 'poor' person can run a node.

@_date: 2017-02-03 09:17:48
Fees are based on the size of the transaction and not the amount.
I have not used Breadwallet, does it have a dynamic fee setting? If so it might be that the fee has increased due to the large number of transactions currently in the mempool. The number started shooting up since late yesterday and its presently in excess of 60,000 transactions.

No, that is what the etc... was for i.e. et cetera. It was meant as an example not as stating facts. But you prove a very good point i.e. tat I'm stupid and do not know the order.
People hate being made to feel stupid and most will avoid any situation where they might be made out to look stupid. So people tend to avoid things and or places where this can happen. Same with bitcoin, make it to complicated and you kill mass adoption.
I hear what you are saying but the fiat currencies are not divisible by more than 2 decimals so stating IF they were means little. The point is to make any transition from the fiat world to the crypto one as easy as possible.
When you travel to another country all you have to remember is what their currency is called and have a rough idea of the exchange rate. No worries about whether the other currency is divisible by 2, 3, 4 etc...
The same should apply with bitcoin. All you have to remember is that it's called bits and that the exchange rate is roughly xxx/xxx. Again, no worry about how many decimals apply to which unit and what each are called and having to do mental gymnastics every time when somebody types one of the several unit names wrong and or you forget which is which etc...
It might be easy for you and others but for most it will just be way to complicated and unfortunately when things are complicated people tend to shun it, i.e. no mass adoption. Nobody is going to go for a 'currency' where each decimal have a new name.
@_date: 2017-02-03 05:20:06
Step one, meet in a public or safe place.
Step two, know what the average bitcoin price is at the time of the transaction. The seller will most probably ask a small premium above the 'market' price. If you know the market price then you will know how much of a premium the person is asking and can thus decide whether its worth it or not.
Step three, ask the person to include a proper/high fee to ensure that the transaction confirms as quickly as possible. Rather pay a couple of cents more and get it through quickly instead of using a lower fee and waiting hours.
Step four, make sure you give the person the correct address and wait for at least 1 confirmation, more would be better if possible.
@_date: 2017-02-16 10:27:45
The moment you sell your bitcoin for anything else, whether cash and or another kind of security then the gain has been realised. As long as you hold the bitcoins then yes, the gain has not been realised.

Still tied into the legacy system. I'm however using bitcoin as much as possible but for larger purchases I still revert to fiat and mostly so for the 'protection' element. 
I used to revert to fiat (cards) when in a rush due to the speed and convenience but now make use of my Xapo or CoinsBank cards instead. Might not be 100% bitcoin but at least better than 100% fiat.

If you mean using the object as a form of payment then no. If you engrave the public address it would mean nothing to the other party as they can do nothing with it, they need the private address/key. 
If you engrave the private key then you sit with a trust issue. You know the key as well as the person whom you are paying. He/she would have to trust you as you can move the funds at anytime. Only way for them to secure the funds would be to sweep the funds from the key which would make the object worthless again.

What do you expect to happen on an exchange that is not regulated? If it's not regulated then there is in all probability no restrictions on things like manipulation so it's something that could and will happen.

Yes but it depends on how long you worked and or how long you stayed there. I know people who have three places between which they move each year. So they are only in a place for about 4 months each year resulting in them never ever being tax resident in any place meaning they end up paying no taxes.
Guess this is the kind of ideal situation if you have a job that allows you to work from anywhere and your income is of such a nature that you can afford to move around like this each year. It's actually not really that expensive if properly planned. Also consider the fact that you earn roughly 30 to 40% more as you are not paying any taxes. In the end the taxman basically pays for your year long holiday.

Not sure whether I understand you correctly, do you want the seller to send you a photo of your address when sending the funds as a proof that it has been sent?
If that is the case then yes you can ask that but it will mean very little as anything like that can be faked. If the seller did in actual fact sent the funds then you should be able to see the transaction almost immediately on one of the block explorers. All you need to do then is wait for the confirmations.

Not so sure about this. When you change your bitcoin for something else at an exchange there is a recordable transaction taking place. The exchange does not just swap the bitcoin for something else. A trade takes place and that gets recorded. So it's basically the same as going through a broker. The records are there.
Also, according to the taxman the transaction needs to be a 'like for like' transaction not to incur a tax liability meaning apples for apples and not apples for oranges. In their view a car and a truck is not even the same so the chances of bitcoin being the same as other crypto is still a gray area and it might not be seen as 'like for like'. Personally doubt whether it would be seen as 'like for like'.
If so then yes, there might not be a tax liability. However, as OP suggested:


This is not possible. How are you going to live off the bitcoin without selling it. You are going to have a hell of a hard time explaining that you 'bartered' the bitcoin for a house, car, food etc... Once again, like for like and in this case it aint so there is a tax liability.
I'm however no tax expert and the laws are different from country to country but common sense tells me that there is no way in hell you are going to make a gain and then just swap it around for something else and by doing so cancel out any possible tax liability. 
Like buying $500k worth of Apple shares, making a $500K gain on it, swap if for Google and then barter the Google shares for a house, car and food and end up not paying tax on anything. If that is true then sign me up for citizenship.

The security aspects of bitcoin is going to be one of its major achilles heels when it comes to mass adoption. All you need is a couple of people on social media telling about the thousands they lost due to this or that (no matter how stupid they were) and pretty soon the masses will drop bitcoin and or demand something else that is 'more secure' and easier to use.
People, in general, have not been brought up to look after themselves. They've been brought up to have everything done for them, just like sheep, and this is the one main reason why I cannot see bitcoin being adopted by the masses until such time where all this security 'friction' is removed.

Been with them for over a year now and have their debit card. Have done about 50 odd transactions on their card and so far never had any problems where the card did not work or anything like that.
Nice thing about their card is that you can set the account(s) from which the purchase must be taken. So you can select just your btc account or also include the ltc, usd etc.. accounts. So you do not have to just use btc which is nice as it can sometimes be a pain like yesterday when I ended up waiting over 5 hours for a transaction with a fee more than double the average.
Overall very happy with them.
**EDIT:** Not sure if you are aware or how long you've been around but CoinsBank is the old Bit-X. They at a stage ran lots of signature campaigns on the bitcointalk forum and afaik they were one of the first ones to bring out a bitcoin debit card.

I guess faucets are a good place for some to start if they have no bitcoin at all but the rates some of these faucets pay are nothing more than dust.
This particular faucets pays a 'reasonable' amount when compared to some others but it will still take you more than a month to reach the cash out level which is 0.012 which is about $5.
If you sit 24/7 and hit the highest payout each and every time you will end up making about $1.80 a day or about $0.07 an hour.
Just go walk down the street and pickup dropped change. I'm sure you will earn ten times this.

Depends on many factors and laws. US citizens are taxed on their worldwide income so no matter how long you have been staying in country x and how you earned the income, its taxable back home.
Other countries work on a residence based scheme where they take into account how many days a year you were present in the country. If less than say 6 months then any income derived abroad are usually not taxable but it may be in the country you reside in as you may be classified as a resident there.
Remember that being a resident of a country does not necessarily mean that you are tax resident. These are two different things. So might not be a resident but you may tax resident and thus liable for taxes.
You will have to give more accurate information as it chances on a case per case and country by country basis and as mentioned, just staying a day longer in a certain place can change everything around.
@_date: 2017-02-16 10:45:41
The question is at what rate do you get your bitcoins back? 
If you for example invest today at say $1,000 and in three months time the price is $1,300 do you get $1,000 plus the interest or do you get $1,300 plus the interest?
If it's the $1,000 plus interest then its a waste of time. I personally believe that the price will go higher this year and to lock it in for just 1% interest is not something I will do.

Xapo essentially make use of a single HD wallet and then allocate addresses in that wallet to each user. These addresses you give out and you receive funds on them.
When you receive funds they have to make a database entry of your updated holdings as that same address is again used when somebody else wants to send funds out. 
So when you send funds from Xapo they use any address with funds on and that addresses, in most cases, do not belong to you i.e. it will not be an address on which you received funds and or an address associated with you. So the bitcoins you receive is actually just a database entry on their side and I guess that is why they ask a fee for all these small amounts.
I think many people make use of services like Xapo for faucets and the like as there are no fees so you can easily move small amounts around and it may be all these small amounts that are keeping them awake at night.
**Just as a side note...** The way Xapo works with the addresses are not ideal as you never control the private keys and we know the whole story about when you are not in control of your own private keys, but, the way they work do offer some good privacy because you can receive funds into your wallet and again send it out without anybody being able to monitor it as you receive funds on addresses A and when you send out they grab any other address in the whole wallet to send funds out for you. So the address being used to send funds out will almost never be an address associated with you.
So a nice way to break the link from say an exchange address to your own wallet i.e. exchange ==&gt; Xapo ==&gt; Electrum or something similar. And you do not pay the fee for the extra hop.
@_date: 2017-02-15 21:39:40

The main thing however is to find out what gets reported, how and when etc... I'm sure the 50K could easily be spread out over time and different places but the thing is that there is still a paper trail and that is all the IRS, or similar, needs to start the hunt.

Fact is, you made 100 bitcoin profit on the exchange and withdrew it. The exchange would most probably have reported this. The taxman is not interested in whether you still have it, whether you lost your keys or whatever other reason you have for not paying your taxes.
You made a profit and he wants his share. If you cannot pay it from the profits made then you will just have to find the funds somewhere else, he does not care where you get it, as long as he gets his cut, with interest if late.

Wanted to post a reply but will it help..... Blockchain/info is just fine, if you are comfortable with their safety and that of 2FA then go ahead, keep everything crypto you own there.
Personally, I sleep better with everything on my Trezor. And in regards to losing it, have you ever lost your car keys? If so then a Trezor is not for you. I've never lost a set of keys in decades so losing a trezor is not a concern and even if I do it's easily and quickly replaced by another and or various other software wallets for the interim.
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:37:10
Trezor user for around 2 years now and very happy with it especially after the updates on the wallet site where Dash and ZCash is now accessible without having to revert to other wallets.
In regards to hardware wallets in general. Go for it. It's difficult to describe the change in the peace of mind to someone who has not used a hardware wallet before. Before I had paper wallets and offline wallets which were a royal pain to manage. Now it's just a matter of plugging the Trezor in, making my transaction and unplugging the device. Simple, easy, fast, and most of all secure.
No longer do you need to worry about how secure your computer is, is your antivirus up to the job etc... Believe me, you will sleep better.
@_date: 2017-02-17 06:36:56
I think this will change as the value of bitcoin increases to the point where the small amounts are actually worth more than say a cent. We can then switch to bits (or whatever other name is decided on) and start expressing 0.00000100 as 1.00 bit. This will then be on par with fiat currencies in terms of decimal places. So a full bitcoin would then become 1,000,000.00 bits
@_date: 2017-02-17 18:40:39
Invest in a hardware wallet, believe me, you will sleep better. The initial price might seem steep but it's worth it for the peace of mind it brings.
Before I had my Trezor I also had paper wallets, an Electrum setup on an offline machine and a watch-only Electrum setup on my main computer etc..
It was a pain in the backside having to jump through hoops each time I wanted to send something and always having to worry about security. Now with the trezor I just plug it in, do the transaction and plug it out. Quick and efficient and most importantly no worries about security. You can even use it on an infected computer without any worries. 
So my advice would be to get a hardware wallet. Trezor, Ledger, KeepKey.

3. [Coinomi]( Supports more than 20 coins but only available on Android.
@_date: 2016-03-28 13:55:18
Give Xapo a look. They are based in Switzerland.
Their fees are essentially the same as for Bit-X and Wirex. Xapo and Bit-x cards are directly linked to your wallet meaning no need to 'upload' any funds to your card before use. Just swipe and the amount comes off your bitcoin balance in your wallet.
Note that Wirex have limits on the max amount you can load onto the card while the others have basically no limits as its directly linked to your wallet.
Wirex limits can be seen here

This is like asking where the bitcoin price will be tomorrow.
If you don't want your stop to be hit then do not set one. If you want to make some profit then obviously it has to be above your average entry price. If you want even more profit then it should be even higher.

Doubt whether we will see a hike in rates tomorrow, just jawboning of the markets as usual with promises of another 4 hikes. However, inflation figures out earlier showed a YOY jump of around 4% which is BIG so we might just see a hike tomorrow.
But then again, as rightly mentions, do we call a 0.1 or 0.2% increase a hike? Guess so if you are sitting on trillions of debt, then each 0.1% can literally kill you.
But then again.... who cares.

The price movements are not normal so it will of course not feel right. Current price movement is driven by news and as such will be volatile and unpredictable to some extent. If you know what you are doing then you can make money no matter which way it goes but most traders will try to trade a single direction and will be take to the cleaners and or will suffer losses.

Firstly, your bitcoins are stored on the blockchain and not on the Trezor. Only thing stored on the Trezor are the addresses and private keys which prove that certain bitcoins belong to you.
In regards to the recovery. All addresses are derived from the 24 seed words. So when you do a recovery you enter your 24 words in the correct sequence and your Trezor does the necessary math in order to derive all the accounts/addresses/keys from those seed words. 
Once done your Trezor then, via the wallet software, scans the blockchain to see which coins belong to any of your addresses and this is then updated/displayed in your wallet.
Extremely simplified but hope it helps.

Agree on the problem with the lack of acceptance among brick &amp; mortar establishments. Guess best thing we can all do is to keep on asking that they accept bitcoin.
Whenever I pay I make a point of asking whether they accept bitcoin. If not I pay for the goods and then ask for a supervisor and or manager and ask them to please consider accepting bitcoin as a payment method. I do not go into a whole discussion about it, I just ask that they look into it. Hopefully this helps to plant the seed and guess if enough people keep on asking that some of them would eventually offer bitcoin as a payment method.

To be honest, you are wasting your time. It will take you about a month, if not more, to earn a dollar from a faucet if you sit behind your pc 24/7. In order to send any coins you have to pay a transaction/miner fee and that could easily be up to a $1 depending on the size of the transaction and also how congested the network is at that time.
It would be much easier to just do some odd job or something similar for say $10 or $20 and buy bitcoins with that.

With some wallets you can do that but the second transaction will not confirm as long as the first is unconfirmed. So A to B needs to be confirmed first before B to C will be confirmed.

Just a FYI, you can also recover the trezor wallet using other wallets, you do not need another Trezor to do so.
Also, storing the seed words in a single place gives you a single point of failure. I would recommend that you store them in at least two places and also that you encrypt them.
There is that ~~'SAM...' or something way~~ [see post below] where you can encrypt the seed words and then split it into three parts and you only need two parts to recover them. Cannot remember what exactly its called now, sure somebody will be able to name it here.

Sending from one address to another will not help. It's like sending an email from one address to the next. The trail it leaves can be followed.
In order to prevent leaving a trail you need to cut the trail by making a clean break. Like with the email example, to break that trail you need to print the email, scan it again and send it on. By doing that the trail stops at the address where you printed it out and a new trail which is not linked, starts with the address from where you are sending it again.
With bitcoin it's essentially the same. You need to break the trail. One way to do that is via ShapeShift. Think of them as the ones scanning your coins and passing it on to a new address thus breaking any link between your accounts/addresses.
I'm sure ShapeShift do keep records of every transaction so how effective this would be I'm not sure. Effective enough for prying eyes but maybe not for uncle sam.

It can be done where you have a trading platform/software which connects to an exchange. In such a case the orders are held locally on your trading platform and only executed once price hits that level. So the orders are not visible to anybody else as they are not 'live' in the order book of the exchange.
With coinbase and the other exchanges your order is placed on their order books for all to see and the system matches them so it will execute it immediately as already explained.
The solution would be if there was a software application that could interact with the coinbase exchange via their api. You can then place your orders on the application and only have them sent/execute to coinbase if the price level is hit.

Only way to get a 'new' recovery seed is to get a new wallet, so basically wipe your old wallet and setup a new wallet which will give you a new set of seed words.
With that said, you can have more wallets if you want meaning have a wallet you use on the device and then use the others as paper wallets. The way to do this is to create a wallet, write down the seed words and say the first three addresses. Now wipe the device and create another wallet.
The first wallet is still a valid wallet, it's just no longer on the device. You can now use it as a paper wallet and when needed just recover it on the device.
The same can also be achieved through the password function where all wallets are on the device at the same time.

It depends on the kind of wallet you are using. 'Light wallets' do not require you to download the whole blockchain thus does not take up a lot of space.
Have you looked at [Coinomi]( ? It handles a large number of different coins including Peercoin. Not sure about 'Monaro' unless you meant Monero or Mona coin. Mona is included but unfortunately not Monero, yet.
Coinomi currently only have an Android version out but there is a desktop version being tested currently.

The send from B to C will never happen as there is nothing to send from B to C i.e. no balance on B. The send from A to B needs to confirm first to create this balance on B.
So the simple reason why it will not work is because you cannot send something that you do not have i.e. no confirmed balance on B.

I agree and think it might just be the most secure of all mobile wallets [maybe desktop ones included] so I'm most definitely not trying to break it down in any way. At the end of the day however, a hardware wallet is just so much more secure especially considering the fact that it's actually offline most of the time. So your coins are in actual fact in cold-storage for almost 100% of the time.

Not sure but what did come to mind were the following:
1) Not sure where your btc comes from but if its from other people/businesses there might be a risk that they've saved an 'old' address and as such might end up sending coins to a wallet you are no longer monitoring,
2) Increased risk of losing your password/seed with the regular switching to a new wallet,
3) Increased administration, that is if you do keep track of all transactions. If so then you will essentially have to 'keep' all the old wallets for reference.

Fully agree with article. FX brokers have to accept deposits/withdrawals in bitcoin, if not they will be left behind.
Before it took me anything up to 7 days to get a deposit via wire (swift) through to my broker and same with withdrawals. Additionally you paid through your nose for withdrawals with the broker fee, bank fee, intermediary bank fee, local bank fee plus conversion fee etc...
With bitcoin it now takes me less than an hour to get funds onto the account and withdrawals are just as quick. Another **big advantage** is the fact that I now buy bitcoin with no fees and at market price. Every week I pull my profits to a sub account on my trading platform. Around 80% is withdrawn to bitcoin, moved to my wallet and cashed out. The other 20 odd percent I keep and only withdraw that if there is a dip in the bitcoin price thus buying in low. There is no fees on bitcoin withdrawals and the withdrawal is done at the prevailing bitcoin price. So no fees and no premium when I'm 'buying' bitcoins.

AFAIK you cannot do this with Trezor (not sure which one you have). Your best bet would be to import the private key into Electrum and then to send the funds to the hardware wallet.
**IMPORTANT** Before you do this.... Make 100% sure that your hardware wallet is properly setup and that you made a backup of the seed words. I will even go so far as to wipe the device and to do a recovery to make 100% sure I have all the words correct and that I get to the same addresses after the recovery. Only then should you send any funds to the device.
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:32:00
Get a Trezor. With a Trezor you can give up your pin and password **and even the seed words** and still walk away with your funds.
A Trezor allows you to have multiple wallets. The default wallet is protected by a pin. Additional to this you can setup wallets each protected by a different password which acts like a 25th seed word. To access those wallets you need both the pin and the password.
So if under serious duress you can go so far as to give up the seed words together with the pin as well as a dummy password for a dummy wallet with some small funds on it.
Once you are in the clear recover the wallet from your seed words, access the password protected wallets and move your funds out. The person who mugged you will be none the wiser. Just do it as quickly as possible and make sure your password is strong. Trezor allows for up to 25 characters for the passwords so it would take the person quite a while to try and guess it.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:43:46
AFAIK all they do is create an invoice from the information you provide i.e. address and amount. Any payment is still made directly to your address so they have nothing to do with the payment process so there should be no security concerns. Will be similar if you generated an invoice using Electrum or similar.
There is however possible privacy concerns in that you are disclosing an address which gets tied to you but for a business this should not be an issue.

You are sitting on 68 bitcoins and do not have a hardware wallet..... The very first thing I would do is secure my bitcoin as best I could before I even start worrying about a fork and or the security of an online wallet.
Breadwallet is good, make no mistake, but no matter how you cut it, it's still a hot-wallet. In regards to Coinbase, just one thing to be said, if you have a wallet there it's not yours, its theirs. It's only your wallet if you control the keys to the wallet.

I do agree to some extent that all crypto's will be affected if bitcoin fails but I doubt bitcoin will ever fail.

Do you trust the exchange enough to be willing to risk all your btc? If not then yes. 
An exchange is not a wallet and you do not control the private keys of the wallet so it's effectively not your wallet. If they for any reason want to freeze your funds they can do so and there is nothing you can do about it. Just look at what recently happened with the exchanges in China.

Address can be linked. Every amount you receive will be used again as an input for another transaction somewhere down the line so if enough information is available then one can start linking addresses to each other.
If you are registered at an exchange where you gave your identity and you made a withdrawal from there to one of your addresses then that address might also be part of the data somebody collects on you and through that can establish your identity as well.
In order to prevent this from happening you need to make a clean break. This can be done by, as you suggested, sending it all to a monero wallet, then onto another and then back to btc.

The two main advantages:
1. Attack vectors
2. Ease of use
With a hardware wallet your keys never leave the device and they are never 'shown' to your computer. Your wallet software will generate a transaction, pass it to the hardware wallet (HW) and the HW then checks the transaction, signs it and passes it back to the wallet software.
So at no time is your keys 'exposed' to your computer environment meaning that your computer can be infected with loads of malware and it will still be secure to use your HW.
When the HW is unplugged, which is about 99% of the time, your coins are essentially in cold storage. Its not connected to anything so no way to attack it except for stealing the physical device but then you still sit with bypassing the pin, passwords etc.. so also not a solution.
With paper wallets, wallets stored on USB drives etc.. you have several attack vectors or angles. You have to encrypt, store, access etc.. the wallet file or information thus leaving many kinds and angles of attack for malware. Also, going this route is a royal pain. I used to have an offline Electrum wallet and a online watch only. Create transaction on one, save it, load it on other, sign it, same process back again and send it. Always worrying about malware, security etc..
With my Trezor I plug it in, do the transaction, plug it out. I don't have to worry about security, its quick, easy, secure, no worries. I'm not worried about malware etc..
There are many other reason why hardware wallets are more secure and also how they protect your keys but best to visit their sites and read more as my facts might not be 100%. The above is just a quick overview of 'why a hardware wallet'.
Just for interest - Did you know that you can have password protected wallets on your Trezor? If you setup your Trezor the default wallet is protected by the pin code. You can then have additional wallets each protected by its own password. This gives you plausible deniability. You can for example put 0.1 btc in the 'pin' wallet and say 1 btc in the password1 wallet and then your fortune of xxx btc in the password2 wallet.
If under duress you can give up the pin so the other party will have access to your default wallet. If they understand a Trezor and know there is password protected wallets and your life is at risk then give up password1. There is no way to know how many wallets there are so they will have no idea whether there are more wallets or not.
If they really turn in the screws you can go so far as to give up all 24 seed words. They can then recover the wallet and confirm the seed words are correct. They will however still not have access to your 'fortune' wallet without password2 and neither will they be able to know whether there are more wallets.
The moment its safe all you need to do is recover your wallet from the same seed words, enter password2 and move your fortune to a new wallet.
So with a hardware wallet you can go so far as to give up all your seed words, your pin and a password and still walk away with your fortune in tact. **Show me how you do that with any other wallet**.

Had the same the other day. Recommended fee was 70sat/B and just to make very sure I added a fee of 129sat/B, almost double.
This was a rather urgent payment. Waited about 2 hours then did the payment via my bank account after arranging with receiver to send the bitcoin back once it arrives.
The transaction eventually went through 6 hours later. So seems a high fee is no guarantee that your transaction will go through quickly.
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:23:07
How will you determine the amount transacted? In many cases a transaction consists of one input and two outputs i.e. the address you sent the funds to plus a change address for any change on the transaction.
Some wallets also allow you to have multiple change addresses in the same transaction so it will be difficult to determine the exact amount actually sent to another party so you will end up paying a percentage on the total amount of the transaction, whether it was sent to yourself or not.

Not just compatible, you can setup your Trezor and Electrum together so Electrum becomes your wallet software.
So Electrum will basically hold a 'watch-only' version (that's a wallet without private keys) of your Trezor wallet so you can monitor the wallet on your computer without any risk of private keys being compromised and without having your Trezor connected the whole time. Keep it in the safe.
When you need to transact you just plug in your Trezor, do the transaction on Electrum, Electrum passes it to the Trezor, Trezor signs it and passes it back and Electrum broadcasts it.
When done plug out the Trezor and the wallet on Electrum 'reverts' back to a watch only wallet.

Every transaction you send includes a mining fee. This is to pay the miners to 'process' your transaction i.e. include it in a block. It mentions there that the fee seems high which it does.

Not sure how you are going to make more bitcoin by buying the dip, if it goes up with 50% [example] you will still own the same quantity of coins, each worth 50% more in value yes, but quantity still the same.

No or low fees you will only find with online wallets. Most of them have however started charging fees now like for example Xapo and Luno.
In regards to buying/selling, this will also mostly only be available in online wallets and as with all online wallets, you will have to provide your personal information in order to open an account.
Only way to get away from the KYC stuff is to use your own wallet like Electrum or similar. 
You might want to look at Mycelium on Android. I know they have a couple of additional services built into the wallet for buying/selling.
Not much help sorry.

Yes, bitcoin can be transferred from any wallet to any other wallet.
Most important thing with wallets is to ensure that you make backups. Write down the seed words and any passwords used when setting up your wallets. There is no way to recover a wallet should you forget and or lose those.

No because there will be sell orders below it meaning that your order will be filled immediately. If there is for example say sell orders worth 2btc on $2,000 and you enter a buy order for 2btc at $2,500 then the software will fill your order with the sell orders at $2,000. The work of the trading platforms/exchanges are to match orders i.e. match buyers to sellers.

What they want from you is an address where to send the bitcoins to so you need to enter one of the addresses which you will find inside your wallet.

Electrum shows you the historical prices. What you can do is create a new watch only wallet and then enter the xpub key of your existing wallet. This will show you all the transactions in that wallet/account together with the historical prices.

When you setup a wallet on your computer you will be provided with either 12 or 24 words. These words are the seed words and all your addresses are derived from them.
Make sure you write these words down as this is your backup. These words are all you need to recover your wallet. Store them in a safe place. Anybody who gains access to them also gain access to your wallet so its important to keep them in a safe place.
Once the wallet is setup you will be provided with a public address or list of public addresses. Any funds sent to these addresses will end in your account so all you need to do, as you mentioned, is send the Coinbase bitcoins to your new public address. Make sure you enter the address correctly as there is no way to reverse a transaction if sent to the incorrect address.
Once done you can check the transaction on a block explorer like blockchain.info. In your browser type in  with the xxxx being the address you sent the funds to.
And yes, your wallet needs to connect to the internet in order to scan the blockchain for relevant transactions and once done it will update your account balance.

Let me get this right... 
You have a wallet with institution A. You do not have control or access to the private keys of the wallet meaning that you do not have control over the wallet except for the functions corporation A allows for on their platform. Should they fail you will have no access to your funds and or any other alternative way and or means to get to your funds as you do not control the keys of the wallet. So in short, its not your wallet.
Not sure about you but think my statement stands, moronic or not. If you are willing to entrust your funds, insured or not (for what it's worth) then so be it. I sleep better with all mine on my Trezor thank you.
@_date: 2016-06-10 07:25:42
The only problem with the Trezor when setup with a second password protected account is that it asks for the password.
If not setup with a second password protected account it only asks for the pin so if one knows how a Trezor works you will know that there is a second account setup just by looking whether it asks for a password or not when its started up. If it does it means there is another account setup.
It should default to asking for a password whether one is set or not. If no password is set one can just click on okay with a blank password. Better yet, it should allow for two pin codes where pin 1 opens your dummy account and pin 2 opens your real account. No passwords and thus no way to determine whether there is another layer of accounts setup on the device.
@_date: 2017-01-19 09:22:18
Did you charge your friend interest? 
If you did not charge interest then it will depend on the tax laws of the country you are in. In some countries a low interest or interest free loan attracts a tax liability as it's seen as a benefit. If this does not apply then there should be no tax liability except for capital gains tax, if charged in your country, when you sell the coins.
If you however did charge interest and derived a profit from it then yes, there is a tax liability on the profit earned.

You order the card in the app. 
Just check whether they have started releasing cards with your name on it. The first batches was nameless cards which they said would be replaced with named cards free of charge.
In regards to the rates. Agree. I was initially interested in the card due to the fact that there was no foreign exchange fee of 3% like with most other cards. There have however been plenty of posts about the poor exchange rate being used, in some cases as much as 5% under market price so I've decided to wait before ordering.
**EDIT:** Wanted to add.... Coinsbank offers a solid card. Been using if for close on three years now with close on 300 transaction through it and it always worked as expected. Never had a problem with it when paying for anything.
Xapo has also worked well for close on three years now but had 2 instances where the card was declined for no apparent reason.

When the first rally happens there are many new entrants to the market. A large part of these new entrants invest due to the crowd behaviour i.e. everybody is going into bitcoin.
When the price corrects you have a couple of scenarios that play out. Some will hold, some will sell early, some will sell later and some will panic sell much later. This is how the weak-hands are shaken out of the market. Most of these late entrants will lose money as they will sell at a loss.
The wise money will only start re-entering the market once they are sure all the weak-hands are shaken out so they will wait for the bottom and then get back in, but not all in one go. They will buy in over a period of time and price ranges.
So a recovery is usually much slower than the initial sell-off as the sell-off usually involve some panic selling near the end which leads to some big movements. The recovery is based on money flowing back in bits and bops over time so it slowly builds. As it builds it will draw more investors who get their confidence back and they also start buying in and so it rises again.
The above is very simplified but gives some idea of what happens in most markets.

Check out TenX, Coinsbank and Xapo.
All of them work directly from the wallet meaning no need to load the card before hand. 
Xapo only works with Bitcoin. Coinsbank use btc and LTC as well as fiat wallets. TenX works with btc, eth, ltc and more, check their site.
Tenx charges no currency conversion fee but their exchange rate when paying in bitcoin is not good.
Of the three mentioned Coinsbank offers the best deal. Good exchange rate and you get a reward of 10 satoshi for every US$0.01 you spend. Depending on the bitcoin price this easily works out to around 5% meaning that the reward covers the 3% currency conversion plus most of the other fees. With the price going where its going it will mean that you will actually be paid to use the card.

Yes, I cannot remember the name of the product now, sure somebody will, its a small device like a USB drive onto which you load the coins. Nobody knows the private key, only way to get to the coins is to break a part of it so it is easy to see whether the private key was accessed.

The pin being asked when the Trezor starts up is the pin that protects your wallet.
If somebody steals your Trezor they will have to guess your pin before they can access your wallet. With each wrong attempt the time before another pin can be retried increases so each time the person has to wait longer before they can try a new pin. 
This should give you more than enough time to restore your wallet on for example Electrum and then to move the funds to a new wallet. Make sure that you select a strong pin of at least 6 digits or more.
@_date: 2017-01-10 12:59:58
There is only one pin and yes it needs to be entered every time you connect to the device. I think you can disable the pin but I would not do that.

Volume is an indication of the supply (sell orders) and demand (buy orders) and this changes minute by minute resulting in the fluctuating volume you see.
So in simple terms volume is a reflection of the number of coins being bought and sold within a specific time so the volume will constantly go up and down as the number of transactions and their sizes increase and decrease.

Ask yourself.... are there anybody other reputable establishment like a bank, brokerage etc.. which come even close to offering the same kind of returns this site is promising i.e. 3+% per day?
If not then ask yourself why this is the case. I mean if it can be done then why are the banks, brokerages and hedge funds not doing it. I mean they have some of the best minds in the industry with some of the most advanced systems and networks.
Now ask yourself again, is this a scam or not? 
3+% per day...... Can be done. Hell I've done over 50% in a day before BUT, and this is a big but, this cannot be done on a continuous basis.  In order to make these kind of returns you have to turn up the risks through increased leverage, larger positions and a larger quantity of trades. This increased increased risk is bound to come back and bite you, it's just a matter of time. 
If the bite is small enough you might be able to continue but eventually the bite will be big enough to wipe you out. So yes it can be done but never for an extended period of time. Maybe a day, at the outmost a couple of days and that is if you are very lucky and the markets are in your favour all the way. Eventually however the outcome will be the same.
So is this a scam, yes. There is no way they can make those returns on an ongoing basis so they will pretty soon start running a pozi where they pay investors out with money received from new investors until such time as the whole house of cards come down.

Should work fine but best to keep an eye on it. Wallets are not perfect and some might still get it wrong. If its an urgent transaction you need to go through as fast as possible then maybe best to just check it before you sned.
Also, there are times where the fees drop quite a bit. Some wallets may still charge you quite a large fee at these times so if you want to save a bit on fees then maybe just do a quick manual check each time.

Its a correction, not a crash. A fall back to double digits would be considered a crash. A fall back to 750 would be a correction of roughly 25% which is nothing out of the norm. 
An 'ideal' correction would be all the way back to around $400 which would be close to a 61% correction, the golden ratio. This will shake out all the weak hands and the chances of a strong rally from this point to past $2k is pretty good.

I don't think it's a risk that governments will develop their own coin, I think it's a given. They will not adopt bitcoin and or any other existing crypto as they have no control over it and control is not something they will give up. They'll want a coin where they can control everything about it. When this will happen is anybody's guess, I personally think we'll only see see the first government issued coin in about 5 years from now with full adoption stretching another 5 to 10 years from there.
What will happen to Bitcoin will be determined within the next 5 years. It will only be around if it can turn into something relevant within the next 5 years. Present levels of usage is not what I'll call 'relevant'. Some might argue but when something is used by less than 1% of the world population then it's not really relevant.
So the future of Bitcoin will be determined by the next 5 years, imho.

If you want to do this for tax purposes then first check your local tax laws in regards to the ownership of foreign companies. I know that in some countries their tax laws state that if you own more than 50% shares in the company, or if more than 50% of the shares are held by citizens of the country (to which the tax laws apply) then that company is seen to be the same as a locally incorporated company and thus get taxed in the same way. 
They also look at other aspects like for example from where the company is run. So if run from say the US but incorporated in HK then it can still be seen as a 'locally incorporated' firm as its managed from local soil.
These incorporations can get pretty complicated very quickly and the companies offering these services will and do not point out all this information to those making use of their services so best to find a very reputable company otherwise you might just be wasting your money and or worse face a major tax bill you were not planning on.
Also, don't think offshore means that your local authorities will not find out. Most countries have already entered into bilateral agreements in regards to the sharing of information in an effort to curb tax evasion. So each country essentially informs the other when ever one of their citizens are economically active in their country. Many of them start to do so electronically as from 2018 meaning all electronic records and databases will essentially be open to your local country to check. So your name will eventually pop up on a list in your local tax offices and that is when you better hope all was done properly.
Moral of the story, spend the time and the money and get it done properly.

This will work if there is only one party to the transaction. When more parties are involved you are bound to run into double spend problems.

Yes that is why you can run the same wallet on more than one device, like for example Jaxx. You can have the same wallet on Win/Android/iOS/Mac/Linux etc..
Also why it's so **important** to ensure that you make a proper backup of the seed words when you create a wallet so that you will be able to restore the wallet should you need to.
If not it will be similar to losing your key meaning no more access to the safety deposit box and its contents and no locksmith that can break the lock.

If bitcoins goes where we all hope for it to go then yes, this is more than possible. 
What percentage of the world population are currently involved with bitcoin and what percentage of those people currently own a full coin?

In short, confidence builds as the markets build. 
You do not get panic buying at the bottom of a market, that you get right at the top before the bubble pops. You will not get investors piling in here at the bottom once prices have fallen like they did. Who ever comes back into the markets now will not do so all in one go. They will buy in bit for bit until they are sure a bottom has actually formed. 
The uptick in the market from a bottom is usually slow because of this. As the bottom builds so does the confidence that it's time to get back in and as this happens so more and more funds flow back in and in turn the price starts rising again.
@_date: 2017-01-03 14:41:21

What you see as manipulation others see as speculation. There is nothing wrong with buying something at a lower price and selling it again at a higher price. That is how markets work.
Problem with bitcoin at this stage is that some have substantially more bitcoins than others and because of that can move the market with their combined efforts. Only way in which this can be countered is to have more people with more bitcoins on the same markets. Until such time the markets will be 'controlled' by those few who have deep pockets.

By creating the transaction on the online machine, saving it, copying it to the offline machine, signing it, copying back to online machine and broadcasting it.
There are other ways this is also being done i.e. sound, scanning of QR codes, mobiles without internet being used as offline wallets etc... When I had such a setup I made use of USB drives but apparently this was not safe so I eventually just bought a Trezor. Now I have best of both worlds, offline except when in use, when in use its secure, and no worries about infected computer systems. I now sleep much better.

Yes the protocol will take care of that so you can spend the change of transaction 1 in transaction 2 and both will go through once they are submitted. The protocol will however not prevent you from creating two signed transactions based on the same number of coins.
I think the only way in which this can work is if a wallet is coded in this way. So the wallet will allow you to do offline transactions i.e. create offline transactions but it will limit you to only create transactions to the same value of the actual coins in the wallet.

There will still be tax due. You started with $100 and ended with $1,000 so there was a gain/profit. Whether the tax man sees it as a capital gain after your shift and or as income I'm not sure but he will surely want his part of that gain/profit.

Agree, would be nice if there was a better way to enter the passphrase. I always worry that my passphrase might get captured when entering it on the computer. 
Maybe a scrambled keyboard which is split into two parts, one side a scrambled A-Z (4 rows of 6 characters) and next to it a scrambled 0-9 keypad but including some of the special characters i.e. @ etc..

Around 2%. All in all I usually come out around 4 to 5% under the market rate. I have a USD card but use it outside USD area 98% of the time so there is the foreign currency conversion fee, the actual conversion rate to USD plus then their bitcoin rate for the bitcoin to USD conversion. 
There is however a bonus of 10 satoshi (0.0000001) for every cent you spend on the card which gets paid to your wallet daily. At current bitcoin prices it works out to just under 3%. This means that my current transactions only work out to around 1 to 2% if the bonus is included. The percentage of the bonus however depends on the bitcoin price as its paid in bitcoin.
If the bitcoin price gets to $5,000 it would mean that you will get 10 satoshi or $0.0005 for every cent spent on the card. This amounts to a bonus of around 5% meaning that you will actually be paid to use the card as the bonus will cover more than all the fees put together.
In regards to the wallets; Coinsbank have bitcoin and litecoin wallets as well as fiat wallets. You can link any of those or all of them to the card. The transactions will then be taken directly from those respective wallets. So no need to 'load' the card, just send funds to your respective wallet.
The limits on the card is good if verified.

You provide your own entropy and create the private key when you setup the device. You can however not see the private key until you 'break' the device so not even you will know the private key.
If you don't want an electronic device then the only real option is a paper-wallet but then there will be trust issues in regards to the private key as you will know what it is and the person receiving it will also know that you know the private key.

I think the first thing you need to determine is whether this actually happened or not. The opening post mentioned that it shows on Blockchain but that it does not show on core, after it was synced. So did the transaction happen or not?
If so, the next step would be to make a note of the exact time it happened. Then its time to start digging for any log files or anything on your machine which could have recorded any information around that time. You said your wallet is on core which is on a linux VM. I'm not that familiar with linux but believe that there should be log files which should be able to provide more information on any activities i.e. was the vm started up at that time etc...
If you cannot find anything I would seriously consider wiping the machine and redoing it from scratch or just get a Trezor. Forgot, you don't trust them, maybe just do the machine over.

Yes there are fees payable to the miners on each transaction. It is important to make sure that the included fee is high enough to ensure that your transactions confirms as quickly as possible. 
The size of the fee is based on the size of your transaction. Most wallets already include a dynamic fee option where the wallets sets the fee for you based on recent market activity. You can however set the fee manually. See the site below, this site will give you an indication of how large a fee you should be including in your transaction.

There is no bitcoins in your wallet. Only thing in your wallet are the keys giving you access to the bitcoins on the blockchain.

Faucets are a waste of time and energy. I'm pretty sure you will consume way more in electricity etc.. in the time it takes you to earn just $1 through faucets.
In regards to bitcoin and missing the boat. We are still in the early days. The price might be quite a bit higher but the boat has most definitely not sailed yet. So best thing to do would be to start buying more. If you truly believe in it then just keep on buying a little each week, don't worry about the price. If it goes to where I think it will then buying in at $900 or $1,100 would make very little difference.

All to do with fees. Did a transaction via Luna (old Bit-X) about two hours ago and it was included 2 blocks later. Luckily they are not skimpy on their fees as I have never had a delay on transactions through them, even with the pending transactions as high as they are now.

Not sure about your setup but one thing to remember which many do not seem to realise, a VM or virtual machine does not necessarily increase your security. A virtual machine running with a wallet on it and connected to the internet is just as vulnerable as a normal pc setup. If not done properly then the VM part offers you no real additional protection.
Best is to take your wallet completely offline by running it on an offline machine or to invest in a hardware wallet and if to expensive for the amount of coins you have then to make use of paper wallets.

The transactions can be tracked from one address to the next address.It is however not always possible to determine to whom these addresses belong, if at all. So it might be able to track the funds flowing from the one address to the other it is not always possible to know to whom those addresses belong.
In regards to the balance, no way for a third party to know that unless they know every address of your wallet ~~and~~ or have access to the master public key of the wallet.

It will most definitely go up but if it does not it will go down.
This is about the best and most honest answer you will get. You are asking the answer to something nobody knows with certainty resulting in them having to venture a best guess and because of that the best answer you will get is nothing more than a guess.
If you are basing your trading/investing decisions on the opinions of others on whether the price will go up and or down then best you rather not trade/invest at all.

Have a look at Xapo or CoinsBank. Their cards are directly linked to your wallet so any purchase on the card is directly taken from your btc balance in your wallet. So no need to convert from btc to fiat to load the card. You just transfer btc to the relevant wallet and use your card.
CoinsBank has the added advantage that you have several different wallets i.e. btc, ltc, usd etc.. You can link any or all of them to the card meaning that funds for your purchase will be taken from a specific wallet and or all of them as required.
So you can keep your funds in either btc, ltc or usd and still use the card without having to move funds around.
Another nice feature with CoinsBank is that you can enable and disable the card. So if you know you are not going to use the card for a while you can go and disable it which adds some extra security should you lose the card. Just remember to enable it again before making use of it. This can be done from their mobile app.

I don't think it will be a matter of trust but rather of whether this could ever happen. Should it happen then I guess the answer would be yes if the institutions were elected properly and also because the ledger would still be public and open to scrutiny no any fraudulent activities could be picked up quickly. So the institutions could be watched and held accountable, which at present is not the case.
On whether it will ever happen.... I hope something like this would happen but doubt it. Every institution will try and run their own show i.e. issue their own 'currency'. For something like this to happen, on a large and or global scale, I think we would first have to see a global meltdown of epic proportions of the current financial system before something like this would be considered.

Wanted to add the following:
Think of each individual address as a separate bank account. The only way for a third party to know whether a specific account belongs to you is if this person can find a link to another account he/she knows belong to you.
So it's all about the transactions between accounts. If you want to keep a wallet (and all its addresses) secret then you have to ensure that any funds going in and out of that wallet is of such a nature that it cannot be traced back to you in any way. So you cannot go and use those funds to buy a plane ticket in your name as you are then linking that address to you as well as any other address that ever transacted with the address you used to buy that ticket.

All economies go through periods/cycles of boom and bust. This is 'normal' and it's how the markets constantly adjust to the underlying supply and demand which drives every economy. Most of the problems we have now were in a way created by the central banks  through their efforts to fight these economic cycles. Through their financial stimulus they are trying to prevent the economy from going through a 'bust' cycle.
If this was done with the resources they had available (i.e. savings) it would not be such a big problem but they are not doing so. They are using resources they do not have so they are creating more and more debt and printing more and more money.
There will come a point where those debts need to be settled and this is when the wheels will come off. Its already starting to happen.
A country making use of bitcoin will not be able to artificially create money like the central banks are doing now due to the fact that bitcoin is limited in supply. So no way to generate more monopoly money without any form of accountability. Essentially they will only be able to use the resources on hand so they will be forced to live within their means. No overspending and no spending money of useless projects etc..

Usually a bad sign. With a rising price you would want to see increasing volumes meaning that the price is being pushed upwards by more buyers joining in.
A decrease in volume shows some buyers are already leaving the rally and that the increase in price is supported by fewer buyers.

Electrum no longer support accounts. Each account must now be made into a separate wallet. Following from the release notes for version 2.7.0:
# Release 2.7.0 (Oct 2 2016)
 * The wallet file format has been upgraded. This upgrade is not    backward compatible, which means that a wallet upgraded to the 2.7    format will not be readable by earlier versions of    Electrum. **Multiple accounts inside the same wallet are not supported in the new format;** the Qt GUI will propose to split any wallet that has several accounts. Make sure that you have saved your seed phrase before you upgrade Electrum.

It's a good idea but most countries have some form of tax legislation in regards to donations where you are only allowed to donate a certain percentage of your income in a tax free manner. You cannot donate your whole income and then have no tax obligation. There will still be some form of tax obligation even if you give it all away. If not for you then most definitely for the one receiving such a donation.
Also consider the bilateral tax agreements between countries. If you declare your donations made to your friend the Chinese authorities would most probably be informed about the donation leading to your friend being liable for whatever taxes might be payable on that side, if any.
Should it however be discovered that this friend does not exist then the tax man might be knocking on your door again in the future asking for some clarification and or to come and collect arrear taxes and penalties and what not or in an even worse case scenario investigate you for tax evasion.
If you leave a trail it will be followed, it's always just a matter of time. So best solution is to leave no trail at all.

In my opinion a total waste of time but I guess it all depends on what you are willing to work for.
At the rate you mention, say 200 satoshi/5min it works out to **$0.0244 per hour** or $0.59 for a 24 hour period IF you hit that button every 5 minutes. 
If you call this real money and you are willing to work for that then faucets are for you. Personally I think the chances of you going to walk around in the city centre for an hour will be more productive as you are bound to pickup about ten times that in dropped coins.
**EDIT:** Just calculated the yearly income. If you hit that button every 5 minutes for 24 hours every day for the next 365 days you will earn a grand total of $215.35 which is at present around a 20% of a bitcoin. Hope that answers your question.

Yes, your seed words are your backup. You can use it again at any stage to restore the Electrum wallet.

You have 2 inputs for this transaction. One of the inputs however still have an unconfirmed transaction which must first be confirmed before this transaction can be confirmed.
EDIT: To clarify, you received funds and then spent it. However, part of the funds you received has not confirmed yet. So you spent funds which has not yet been confirmed. The received funds has to be confirmed first before the spending transaction can be confirmed. Usually the receiving one will confirm while the spending one can be in the next block.

The reason for recommending a hardware wallet is because of the ease of use and the convenience it gives you without compromising on security. 
Anything stored on the hardware wallet is essentially in cold storage the whole time the device is offline. When online it's protected against keyloggers and the like so can even be used on an infected machine without compromising your security.
Nothing wrong with paper wallets but when compared to each other they do fall short as there are times where you are exposed to certain risks i.e. when sweeping the wallet on a compromised machine etc...

Agree, had a transaction sent through Xapo about 13 hours ago. At that stage the recommended fee was 73 sat/B for inclusion in the next block.

The IP address is that of the node broadcasting the transaction. I was under the impression that it was from the first note doing the broadcasting but this does not seem to be the case. So the ip address appearing is anything but accurate and most definitely not your ip address. The ip address of the node could be for a node that is not even in the same country as you.

What you can also do is to send ALL your funds. So if you have say XXX on address A and need to send XX to another person then make the transaction to send XX to the person and the rest of your balance to the next address in your wallet.
In that way your whole balance is always moving on to the next address in line leaving the previous address empty after the transaction.

On the mobile wallet?
@_date: 2016-11-28 05:19:06
Addresses within the same wallet are linked as they are within the same wallet. HOWEVER, you can see this when you open your wallet as it will display all of your addresses, a third party however cannot see this so they have no idea which addresses belong to the same wallet.
All a third party can do is trace transactions from a known address and by doing so build up a picture of other addresses the known address is linked to.
So for starters they will need an address that they know belong to you, say one you posted on a forum or similar. From there it's a matter of collecting as much transactional data as possible to try and build a picture of whom you transact with and also possibly identify other addresses that belong to you.

Whether you make use of these online services does not matter. The people, i.e. Circle, are requesting information from their clients in regards to whom they dealt with. So your information might end up in their database even if you do make use of their services.

Blocks are like busses. There are a limited number of seats on each bus and a limited number of busses driving each day.
So when things get busy there is a big chance of you not being able to get a place on any of the busses unless you are willing to pay more than all the people who are also trying to get onto the busses. If you do then your chances of getting a seat is better, if not then you can end up waiting hours or even days for a buss where there are any seats available.
So there is a desperate need for larger busses so that everybody can get to where they need to go and to provide more room for the additional people who also want to start making use of the buss services.

Any HD wallet, like for example Electrum will give you a whole list of addresses when you create a wallet. Funds sent to any of those addresses will end in your wallet so you can make use of any address or even generate more if required.
In regards to faucets, it's a complete waste of time. I can guarantee you you will make more money in other ways than you will ever make with faucets, example, wash somebody's car for say $5 or more. It will take you a month if not more to make that kind of money on a faucet.

CEO of this company is Mbithi Kioko (according to the website) and Reddit username of op is mbithy, coincidence? I think not.
If its the CEO posting here ask yourself why he posts acting like a third party instead of just coming out and stating this is my business and this is what we do.
Business is based in Kenya and I see no information about it falling under any financial regulatory authority meaning that if they go tits up that you will have very little recourse to recover your funds.
There are other better established brokers who are regulated who offer bitcoin deposits/withdrawals and some also allow you to hold your balance in bitcoin. I'll be carefull and do my homework.
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:23:13
Your BitX and Electrum wallets are two separate wallets each with their own list of addresses so the balance of the one will not be reflected by the other. In order to see the balance on Electrum you have to transfer the balance on BitX to Electrum.
Of the two Electrum is more secure as you control your private keys. With BitX you do not have control over the private keys. If BitX should close down for one or other reason it would mean that you would be at their mercy to get your coins out as you do not control the wallet.
With that said, the security of Electrum is dependant on how secure your computer is. Make sure your computer is free of any malware etc.. and also ensure that you make a proper backup of the seed words when setting up a wallet. Without the seed words you will be unable to recover your wallet should it be damaged/deleted etc...

Yes a hardware wallet is like cold storage as it's always offline when not in use. So a person needs to gain physical access to the device for a start. If they do manage that they will however still need to get past the pin etc..
One way to store the seed words is with a [Cryptosteel]( if you are willing to spend some more.
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:25:31
Just a suggestion, do not buy for the full 10k in one go. Split the 10k up into say 5 parts of 2k each and then buy 2k's worth of bitcoin each week over the next 5 weeks.
If the price drops it will mean that you will get some bitcoins at a lower price which will bring your average buying price down a bit. The opposite however will also apply should the price rise over the 5 weeks.
You should however be able to get a better overall price if you buy over an extended period instead of all in one go.
@_date: 2016-12-02 06:43:10
Once you have encrypted the keys you then sit with the problem of how to save the password for incase you forget it. So basically the same problem again. 
Personally I will just go with a hardware wallet. I bought a Trezor just over a year ago and am very glad I did. No more worries about security etc.. All I need to worry about is keeping the seed words safe which is not hard to do. 
So I would suggest that you look into the hardware wallets currently on offer. Believe me, you will have more peace of mind and sleep better :-)
@_date: 2016-12-01 08:19:18
You need either the seed words or the xpub/xpriv key in order to see all transactions for a specific wallet. Without it there is no way to determine which other addresses belong to the specific wallet so no way to see all transactions for the specific wallet.

Never used them before so do not know. Checked MoneyGram's homepage and all I could find was the following:
"Money orders offer a **low cost option** for making payments"
So clearly there are still fees involved and I doubt whether they are as low as they try to make them out to be. No idea what the actual fees are though as there is no information about that on their site. So maybe best to contact them and get the exact fees involved.

And so the dots are being connected.... 
These online wallet providers [plus their 'friends', the IRS]  will pretty soon have a large database with the details of all the addresses together with their respective owners. **Whether these people are their clients or not**. If you transact with any of their clients then your information is bound to be included in this database as soon as their client provides the information to them.
So much for your privacy. 
EDIT: Guess we will in the near future read about how these databases were hacked with all the transaction details and personal information of those people being exposed to the world at large. Meaning, the keeping of such information will most definitely become the target of hackers at some point.

When it comes to Coinsbase then there's no problem as Coinbase knows which addresses belong to you. If however it's a 'private' wallet, meaning one you setup yourself, on say Electrum or similar, then only way for them to know will be for you to provide the information.

I think it will mostly depend on your reasons for buying. If you are looking at buying now in order to hold for the next couple of years then the current price should not be such a big issue as I believe it will go much higher in years to come.
If however you are in it for the shorter term, i.e. planning to sell for a profit in the near term, then it might be best to only buy on the dips which we are bound to see.
Maybe the best strategy is to split your funds up and to buy on each dip over the next couple of months thus giving you a better average buying price.

Since last week and will leave it there for a while. There is no time period attached to the trades, how long they will stay depends on what the price does. If it hits a support level higher up and there is clear support pushing price higher these buys will most probably be moved up higher or cancelled completely and funds used to buy in on smaller dips.
**EDIT:** Must just add, those levels are marked on my chart, the lower level orders are not actual orders on an exchange as I hold most of the funds off an exchange. So I wait until price comes within a couple of hundred $ from my levels before I will actually move the funds and enter those orders.

Its more a privacy than a security issue. Anybody who knows your address is able to lookup the address on any of the block-explorers and see all transactions related to that address.
If you receive say your salary on an address and also use that address for personal transactions it would mean that your employer will be able to view your personal transactions. Also, anybody else sending to that address or who knows that the address belongs to you would be able to view your salary related transactions and possibly be able to track your spending as well.

Yes, the passphrase is like a 25th word. So you can basically give somebody your 24 seed words and pin and they will still not be able to access your wallet until they manage to guess/crack the 25th word.
**Edit:** Forgot to add, that is why its important that you also write down any passphrase(s) you use. The 24 seed words will only recover the 'default' wallets. You then still require the passphrase(s) to access any passphrase protected wallets. Without those you will not be able to access your wallets/funds.

When trading I always spread my entries over several areas. This is mostly done to spread my risk and to ensure a better average entry point.
Example: I want to buy $10k in bitcoin.
I break this down into three parts i.e. 10% - $1,000, 40$ - $4k and 50% - $5k.
The $1k I then break down again into say 3 or more parts and place the orders within a certain area. In this case the $1k is split into 4 parts of $250 each and the orders are placed on 6,490, 6,495, 6,500 and 6,510.
If they are all picked up it will give me an average entry price of 6,498.
Same applies for the lower levels. Also, the lower levels are all larger in size meaning that my average entry price decreases the more orders get entered. If everything gets picked up I will end with an average entry price around the $5,950 for all the orders so that will be my breakeven point i.e. anything above that in future is profit on this batch of orders.

When you enter a passphrase a new set of wallets are created so you have your default (old) wallets and the passphrase (new) wallets.
To access the default wallets just enter your pin without any passphrase. To access your passphrase protected wallets you enter your pin and the passphrase.
Your coins are most probably still on the default wallet. You have to move them over to the 'new' passphrase wallet.

Biggest advantage for me personally is the 'ease of use' factor when using my Trezor. You just plug it in, do your transaction and plug it out afterwards.
When plugged out your coins are in 'cold storage' as its not connected to the internet and while connected you know that they are as secure as they can be without having to worry whether your computer, or the computer you are using, are infected with malware or not.

Both work directly from your wallet meaning there is no need to 'load' the card first, just send funds to your wallet.

Your 'sending' and 'receiving' address is the same thing. If you give address A to somebody to send you bitcoin then address A becomes your 'receiving' address.
If you send the funds received on address 'A' on to somebody else then the transaction will show address 'A' as the address sending the funds. So the receiving addresses becomes your sending addresses.
A transaction can also make use of multiple inputs where more than one 'receiving' address is used i.e. the funds are combined to make up the amount you need to send. In such a case the transaction will show two inputs or sending addresses.
@_date: 2016-09-05 17:17:58
Its the change amount. Each time you send x amount your wallet will combine several inputs to make up this amount. The input amount will hardly ever be the exact amount you want to send so the balance is returned to the wallet as change.
Example: You want to send 100BTC. In your wallet you have two inputs with amounts of say 80 and 90. In order to send the 100 the wallet has to combine the two inputs (170 total). It will then send the 100 to the address you entered and the balance of 70 will be returned to the wallet as 'change'.

There is also a delay built into the pin function. Each time you enter an incorrect pin the delay is increased. Following from the manual:
"All operations on TREZOR require the user to enter a PIN. The attacker would have to guess your PIN which is very difficult because with each badly entered PIN the time for entering it anew increases exponentially. For example, the delay between 19th and 20th PIN entering is 35 hours. Unplugging and plugging the device won’t help. The thief would have to sit his life off entering the PINs. Meanwhile you have enough time to move your funds into a new device or wallet from the paper backup."

I think the reason nobody is helping is because you are asking the most basic of questions which should have been answered for you already if you read some of the beginner documents.
Let me try and give you the bare bones here. In order to use bitcoin you need a wallet. A wallet contains several addresses. The wallet is essentially like a bank that you own and the addresses are all the account numbers in the bank which you also own.
Just like you I also have a wallet with all my addresses. When you want to send funds to me you need to have one of my addresses/account numbers, just like with a normal bank. You will then go to the send screen of your wallet, enter my address/account number, enter the amount of bitcoins you want to send to me and click send.
The transaction will then be sent to the bitcoin network where the miners will verify the transaction and allocated the bitcoins you sent to my account number, again, just like with a normal bank.
So you send me bitcoins and those bitcoins left your wallet and is now in my wallet on one of my addresses/account numbers. If I want to send it on to somebody else again I need their address which I then also enter and I follow the same steps to send it again to them.
In order to do this you however need funds to send. Without any funds you can obviously not send anything. So go and setup two wallets for yourself, wallet A and wallet B, set these up on the testnet. There should be a link to a faucet where you can get testnet coins, i.e. like monopoly money to play with.
Once you have these in your one wallet you can start sending it from the one wallet to the other.

If enabled Electrum will send any change a 'change' address. You can also select to have the change split up over more than one change address to increase your privacy.
If disabled (not ticked) it will return the change back to the address from which you are sending so it will not make use of change addresses.

I know paper wallets are different but saying that what you are doing is essentially the same in that you are creating a wallet, making a note of its seed words and then deleting the wallet so that it no longer exists on a device. So very similar to a paper wallet but less secure.
Reason for saying its less secure is because on MyCelium you create multiple HD wallets and then remove all of them except for the initial one. All those wallets were derived from the same seed just like the initial HD wallet.
If your phone is stolen then the person who have it might be able to gain easier access to the other HD wallets due to the main HD wallet still being there.
I think it would be more secure if you created the wallets as mentioned but then completely wipe all wallets from MyCelium and restart it with a new HD wallet.
But for all that trouble a paper wallet might just be that much easier to setup plus its quite easy to just import it into MyCelium as and when required without having to restore all those deleted HD wallets.

Last time I tried the sweep function did not work, I had to create a new wallet and import the private key and then send it to my normal wallet. I'm sure this has been fixed by now.
In regards to safety, if your computer is safe then I cannot see any problems.
@_date: 2016-09-20 08:27:28
You are essentially making use of MyCelium to create a paper wallet. This can be done in a more secure way than the steps you describe above. Just follow the steps posted on the net on how to securely generate a paper wallet. It will be far more secure than the way you are doing it now.
@_date: 2016-09-30 10:23:38
Sorry, think I'm confusing you. What I meant was that the Trezor, or any hardware wallet, works like any other wallet but with the added security. Meaning that there are no short comings when compared to other wallets.
The device alone however cannot operate by itself, it has to interfaced with either its own website and or be linked to some or other wallet software in order for the user to use it. Some think that you just need the Trezor and nothing else.

Not sure if I worked this out correctly but if your computer process around 2.5m combinations a second then it will still take around 2 years to test all possible combination.

Just a suggestion, this worked well for me in the past. Arrange to meet at your local bank where you have an account and where there is usually security personnel on duty.
Show the person the wallet/address/balance to confirm that you have the required quantity of btc. Let him then go and make the required deposit. The bank will check the notes etc.. for you and you are sure that the funds are legit and in your account.
Once done transfer the btc and wait for the confirmations.
IMPORTANT: As stated, make sure about your local laws. In most countries you need to be licenced in one way or another to act as a currency dealer/exchange etc...

Governments are quick to point out that all these financial regulations are there to protect you but what they do not mention is that it's also the ideal vehicle for governments to use to fill the depleted state coffers.

Yes but it will get processed as a normal transaction meaning that you will have to include a miner fee just like with any other transaction.
There is no way to 'move' funds from one address to another within the same wallet without sending it via the miners and having it recorded on the blockchain.
In regards to your other question about the seed words. I have a Trezor but I'm not sure whether one can check the seed words. I usually setup a wallet and before doing anything else wipe it and then recover it. If the recovery worked then I know the written information is 100% correct and only then do I use the wallet.
@_date: 2016-09-20 10:14:45
Sent where or to whom?
If you sent it to somebody else then there is no way to recover it, the other party will have to send it back to you.

Its change, think of it as paying with a $10 bill for a $6 item. You cannot give $6 as there is only a $5 and $10 bill so you give the $10 bill and the $4 is returned to you.
Same with your inputs for the transaction. You had 0.033 which was used to pay the 0.021 and the 'change' (0.011) was sent back to you.
There is an option in Electrum which you can set 'Make use of change addresses'. If enabled then the change will be sent to one of the change addresses, so a different address as where the funds came from.
If not enabled then the change will be returned to the address you sent from.
@_date: 2016-09-29 16:41:41
There is no way that I know off to see old addresses in the wallet. Guess best is to get one of those sites which you can use offline where you enter your seed words and see all the addresses that are derived from them.
The transaction should have shown up already, even on zero transactions.

No not directly over the bitcoin network.
I think you can still do this via BlockChain if you have an account there. They used to allow you to include a message with the transaction. These messages were however only available on their site so the receiver would have to know to go look there for a message. So its not a message that would pop-up on the receiver's side when he receives the transaction.
@_date: 2016-09-27 19:21:20
Not from what I can remember. Do they not pay the fees? If so maybe email them and ask them to up their standard fee to ensure quicker inclusion of the transaction.

The Trezor comes out with very little storage space on the device so its unable to store all the passwords on the device so it makes use of Dropbox to store the passwords.
All passwords entered are encrypted making use of the information on the Trezor. Not exactly sure how and what it uses but let's assume it makes use of the main private key to do this. So all password information you enter gets encrypted by this key and then saved on Dropbox from where it can be accessed. 
If you restore your wallet you enter your seed words which will recreate the wallet as well as the 'main private' key or whatever the Trezor used to encrypt all the password details so it will be able to recover all that password information from Dropbox so no additional backup required.
Trezor also functions as a U2F and Dropbox already works with this.
I'm also not sold on this password manager but it has more to do with the way it works than with the security aspects. I'm a Keepass user and it just works better and suits my needs better. I do however believe that the Trezor is more secure and will keep an eye on future developments of this password manager and might switch at a later date.
Also, I agree that the passwords should not be stored anywhere else except for on the device. But then again, any password manager stores it on your computer and some even online so not much difference. At least the Trezor does a proper encryption job when doing so and no need to worry about any additional backups.
EDIT: In regards to your question about how the passwords are changed, the application runs in a browser where you can setup and change all the relevant details for each site/account etc.. See the link I posted earlier.
@_date: 2016-09-30 08:18:33
Yes wallet is not the ideal term to be used.
Okay, so hardware vs. online/software wallet.
The main reason for a hardware wallet is for increased security. As you know, inside of each wallet are all your addresses and each of those have a privatekey associated with it. Anybody who manages to get hold of the private key of a specific address can control that address i.e. send funds from it. So if somebody manages to get hold of your private keys they have full control over your wallet and can take all your funds.
Online wallets are the least secure due to the environment they operate in i.e. online. With online wallets you have little or no control over the security aspects as these are handled by the parties hosting/providing the wallet service. 
Software wallets on your computer are better as they operate in a more secure environment i.e. on your computer and if you protect your computer with firewalls and such then your wallet should be safe from malware and viruses that attempt to steal your private keys. There are however still risks, as mentioned, viruses and malware.
Hardware wallets exist only inside of the device i.e. a Trezor. It is designed in such a way that it never reveals the private keys to your computer so any malware on your computer will not be able to gain access to the private keys. With a hardware wallet you still make use of some kind of software to interact with the bitcoin network. This software can either be the myTrezor website or other wallets like Electrum or MyCelium which has been designed to also work with Trezors.
The software however do not have access to the private keys like with a 'normal' software wallet. Each transactions gets created and then sent to the Trezor which then signs the transaction internally and sends the results back to the software wallet or website which then passes it to the network. So at no stage does the software see any of your private keys. Because of this you can use a Trezor even on an infected computer and still be safe.

Yes, your wallet will create a new address each time you receive funds. You do not have to use a new address each time though, you can use the same address over and over. It is however best to use a new address each time to receive funds as this gives you more privacy.


Yes. When you send funds a transaction is created with what is called inputs and outputs. The inputs will be the details of your address with the funds and the outputs will be the address(ess) to which the funds must be sent. This transaction is then broadcast to the network where it will get processed and recorded on the ledger/blockchain. So in simple terms yes, it will say 'this amount to be moved from this address to this address'.


Yes, not to get to technical but yes, there are nodes on the network to whom the transactions are sent. All these pending transactions go into a pool. The miners take transactions from this pool when they process the blocks that go onto the blockchain and include them in these blocks. When your transaction is included in a block its is 'processed' and recorded in the blockchain where everybody can see it.


You are thinking in physical terms i.e. me handing you $10 from my wallet which you then put in your wallet so a physical exchange. You need to think in terms of how banks works with their ledgers. If I send you money from my bank account to your bank account the bank makes an entry in their ledger to say debit account x and credit account y. If I go to the ATM to draw a balance the ATM queries the ledger and sees that there is a credit on my account and my balance is now xxx. Same with bitcoin.
When your bitcoin transaction is included in the blockchain its similar to a ledger entry stating funds came from address x and went to address y so the owner of address y now have xxx balance on that address. When you open your wallet it queries the ledger and sees the transaction related to the address which belongs to you and will then reflect this credit.


Yes, once included in the blockchain its official that the funds have moved from x to y and that y now have control over said funds.


When you setup your wallet you provide a password to protect that wallet and all the addresses inside of it. So you are the only person with full control over all those addresses. If I send funds to any of those addresses and it is confirmed through the blockchain then it means that only you will ever be able to access/control those funds.
@_date: 2016-09-05 15:12:11
The final balance is 530. That is after the 111.97 was sent. The 320 that was returned have nothing to do with the balance, its the change amount. Could have been anything else.
So the balance before that last transaction was 530 plus the 111 so around 641. The 111.97 was then sent from that address leaving the 530 closing or final balance.

1. the wallet is fully cross-platform (Mac, Win, Linux, Android, iOS, Chrome etc..)
2. its also a multi-coin wallet i.e. BTC, ETH, ETC, DAO, DASH (Dash being removed in iOS version) and more to come,
3. its open source and has gone through a security audit,
4. there is a hardware wallet on its way which is being designed by the same people so it should integrate well with this wallet making things much easier in terms of security for most,
you should give it a try.

Do you have the private key for that address? If so then you have to sweep the address to get the funds into your Electrum wallet. You do this by following these steps:
Wallet --&gt; Private Keys --&gt; Sweep
Enter the private key in the space provided and select the address to where the funds should be swept below that.
If that does not work then create a new wallet in Electrum by following these steps:
File --&gt; New/Restore --&gt; Enter wallet name --&gt; Select 'Restore a wallet or import keys' --&gt; Select 'Standard Wallet' --&gt; Enter the private key in the space provided 
This will give you a new wallet with a single address. Best to transfer the funds out of that address to your normal wallet as soon as possible.

Depends on your circumstances. I do buy to 'consume'. I buy plenty of bitcoin for the sole purpose of making money transfers so I buy it, transfer it and then sell it again. However, one can also say I'm exchanging and not buying.
Also, many see bitcoin as an 'asset', they buy it in the hope that it appreciates in value. So from their point of view they are not exchanging currencies but rather buying an item/asset. So I guess it depends on your point of view.
I get what you are saying but the buy/sell is so ingrained in trading that I doubt it will ever be referred to as 'exchanging'.

Have not used Electrum in a while but I know it had a setting where you could disable the use of change addresses. On a wallet with multiple addresses it would  result in the change being returned to the sending address.

There is no client that I know of. The closest you are going to get to this with Bitcoin is if you use BlockChain.info as a wallet. With them you can add a note to the transaction which will show on their site.
Note - It only shows on their site as the message is linked to the transaction in their own databases. The message is not linked to the transaction in the actual blockchain so it will not appear anywhere else.
The receiver of the funds will have to know that there is a message and will also have to know to go to blockchain.info to view such message.
The only other alternative is something like ShadowCash where the platform includes a messaging system where you can send encrypted messages to somebody if you know their public key/address.

Doubt whether these payments will amount to anything in regards to the amounts involved. Advertisers currently pay minute amounts for each impression and Brave will keep/get a portion which is then shared with the users of Brave.
The more Brave users the smaller that amount becomes. So I guess it will be micro-micro-micropayments.
@_date: 2016-09-30 06:41:57
Which wallet are you using?
In the wallet you will have several addresses. To get the bitcoins into the wallet you withdraw the bitcoin from the exchange. When doing so you will be asked for an address to which the coins must be sent. Enter one of your wallet addresses. Once done the coins will be sent to your wallet.
There is also a testnet you can use to play around with and from what you say it might be the best thing to do for now. Get a wallet that supports the testnet, like MyCelium (or the one in the link below) and setup a wallet on the bitcoin testnet and play around with that before starting to use real bitcoins.
 
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:06:18
In order to send funds you need to enter the private key of the paper wallet on your computer. Doing so could compromise the security of the wallet should you have any malware on your computer which will result in the balance on the wallet possibly being stolen.
Best practise is to send the balance to a new paper wallet at the same time or right after sending the amount you wanted to send and then not to use the 'old' paper wallet again.
@_date: 2016-09-20 11:08:59


True but you are still faced with the very same problems when it comes to storing the seed words for the wallet on MyCelium.
I have no problem with the concept you are sharing and think it is possibly a good way for those already making use of MyCelium, it's very similar to the password protected wallets on a Trezor i.e. 'hidden wallets'. I personally just think that there is more that can go wrong than with just a plain old paper wallet.

I won't say that a Trezor is misleading as it's a fully fledged wallet plus much more i.e. password manager, 2 Factor authentication, etc...
The Trezor however need to be able to 'speak' to the outside world and for that software is needed, either in the way of a website and or with it linked to a wallet like Electrum. 
There are hardware wallets like for example the Case wallet which works completely independently from any software on your computer. It links directly to the network through gsm/mobile connection.
Hardware wallets are really worth it, I have a Trezor and it makes life so much easier. No more worries about security and or infected computers and no need for paper wallets anymore. If you plan on acquiring a large sum of bitcoin I would seriously recommend a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2016-09-30 07:20:06
Same way the funds get to your bank card which is also in your pocket.
There is a ledger, just like with a bank, which have all the transactions recorded on it. So if somebody sends you money it does not physically end up on your card but ends up as an entry in the ledger.
When you swipe your bank card the bank checks the ledger to see whether their is any funds on that card and if so allow the transaction to go through.
With bitcoin its similar, in layman's terms. There is what is called the blockchain which is essentially a ledger of all transactions. So when I send bitcoins to you it is recorded in the ledger just like with your bank card. 
When you open your wallet or plug the Trezor in the software queries the blockchain/ledger to see whether there are any transactions for your addresses/account number and if so will display them in your wallet.
Does this make sense?
EDIT: So its not physical bitcoins being sent from person to person but rather journal or ledger entries being made, again, just like with a bank.
@_date: 2016-09-30 07:55:02
You've got it now. 
Yes everything is about the blockchain, the ledger. So all transactions happen there and your wallet just sync's up with that and shows you any transactions that took place involving any of your addresses.

@_date: 2016-09-17 08:35:13


Not as far as I know but what you can do is to make use of the password option on the Trezor. If you do, the Trezor combines the 24 seed words with the password to generate the HD wallet. So the wallet cannot be restored with just the seed words, you need the password as well.
I'm not sure if there's a limit on the password length but sure you can make use of a couple of words so in effect creating your own seed words which are then combined with the 'default' seed words.

If you want to sell relatively large quantities of an item you need to find buyers. Buyers buy so they can sell it again later for a profit. To maximise this profit they try and buy at a lower price.
So the sellers have to entice the buyers by offering the items at a lower price. If there is more sellers than buyers it results in the sellers competing for the lower number of buyers meaning they offer their items at even lower prices. The net result is the prices come down.
In times of panic this can get so bad that sellers want to get out as fast as possible so they drop their prices quickly and also in larger steps which results in prices 'crashing'.
The opposite is also true. If there is more buyers than sellers then the buyers compete with each other by offering higher prices in order to entice sellers to sell to them. So prices keep on going up. If there is a large number of buyers it could result in sharp price rallies.
See supply and demand for more details of how this works.

The use of a certain wallet has nothing to do with the 'decentralization' of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-25 07:07:08
Yes, the main or default wallet is only protected by the pin you setup. So whenever you plug the Trezor in you are asked for the pin and after that the password (if passwords are enabled on the device).
To access the default or main wallet you enter your pin and just click on okay on the password screen without entering any password. This will open the default wallet i.e. the one not protected by any password.
If you however want to access the wallet protected by a password then you enter your pin and on the password screen you enter the correct password and click okay. This will then open the respective wallet protected by that password.
You can have as many of these password protected wallets as you want. So you can have say the main wallet which is protected by pin only, then wallet 1 with password 'wallet 1' (just an example), wallet 2 with password 'wallet 2' etc...
So the Trezor device will open either the main wallet or if a password is also supplied then the wallet protected by the respective password. 
If you do use passwords you must make sure to keep a copy or make sure you remember them. Without them you will not be able to access those wallets. The seed words will restore all wallets but you will still need the passwords to access those restored protected wallets.
**EDIT:** What is nice about the password option is that it allows you to hide wallets. When a Trezor is started up one can see whether the password option is enabled or not by the fact that it asks for a password. So if the government agencies ever force you to show all your wallets you can enter the pin and show them the default wallet. If they are however clued up and understand about the passwords then you can enter say 'wallet 1' and show then wallet 1. There is however no way for them to know how many wallets there are on the device so they will not know whether there is a wallet 2, 3, 4 etc.. 
So when setting up the Trezor the ideal would be to setup the default wallet and use this for everyday transactions and to also setup say two password protected wallets. The first as a dummy with some smaller transactions and some btc and then the second password protected wallet where you hide the bulk of your btc if you wish to do so. If ever forced to disclose those hidden wallets you give the password for the first dummy wallet and keep the second one hidden.

I think it has more to do with the way we speak.
When we say we exchanged an item for another we 'see' an exchange transaction i.e. I give you my bicycle for your skateboard, we swap items.
When we acquire something and use money to do so we buy it, we do not say we exchanged our money for something i.e. I went to the market and exchanged my money for groceries. In the same way most of us say 'I had to buy some dollars as I'm going to the USA next month'.

Think I just have to clarify my earlier statement. Cards issued by Wavecrest will work outside the EU area so they can be used anywhere in the world HOWEVER, these cards may only be issued to people residing within the EU area. So in order to get a Wavecrest card you need an address within the EU area. If you have then you can apply for such a card and the card will work anywhere in the world.
If you however reside outside of the EU area then Wavecrest is not allowed to issue you with a card. If they did then any such card will stop working on the 15th of October.
In regards to your link... No, I have a Coinsbank and Xapo card. Your link is for a Bitpay card. If that card is issued by Wavecrest then the same will apply. Best would be to contact them to find out. As said in my earlier post, Coinsbank also made use of Wavecrest but have now contracted with another card issuer for the issuing of cards for clients outside the EU. Bitpay might have done the same. So they might not state it on their site but they might also be making use of two card issuers.
Best is to check with each. Also check out Tenx. At this stage it seems to be the best offering as there is no currency conversion fees on the card so no 3% per transaction if used outside the cards monetary area i.e. using a USD based card in say the EU. You also get rewards on the amount you spend on the card.
Coinsbank will be my next best choice. Very good exchange rates and you also get a relatively decent bonus paid in bitcoin. They have btc, ltc and fiat available in their online wallets and you can use any or all of those accounts for your card payments meaning that you can hold funds in btc, ltc, USD, EUR etc.. and just link whichever or all those to your card.
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:59:52
Have a Coinsbank and Xapo cards and both will stop working on the 15th of October due to the Wavecrest story. Xapo has not announced any plans for their users outside the EU so I take it they don't give a **** about those clients. Coinsbank have a new issuer on board and I've already ordered a new card which will work outside the EU.
TenX had similar problems as they also used Wavecrest. They managed to get a new issuer on board and will be issuing 'new' cards to those outside the EU. Just not sure why they take so long as delivery is only expected in November. Coinsbank went through same process of getting a new issuer and their new card will be on its way by next week so expected delivery is around mid October.
In regards to the space getting crowded... I agree. The number of crypto users are very small, I think less than 1% of the world population. Of that I guess around 2 to 5% might get a card. Some of these companies, like Tenx, have very high hopes of signing up millions of users and doing billions of transactions. I think they are overestimating the actual demand. It might be possible but not within the next couple of years as per their white paper.

Wavecrest was the card issuer used by Coinsbank, Xapo, Tenx and some others. Wavecrest issued card to people outside the EU but apparently its mandate/licence only allowed it to issue cards within the EU area. 
Not sure who took them to task, most probably Visa/MC so they had to stop this and all cards issued to people outside the EU had to be cancelled. So all those who received cards and who are outside the EU area now sit with cards that will stop working on the 15th of October.

Trezor user here so cannot comment on the quality of the ledger etc. but from what I've read it seems to be good and reliable.
Reason for posting was to say that getting a hardware wallet is really worth it. I also started out with software wallets, first just on my computer then main wallet on offline machine and watch-only on the online computer, paper wallets etc........
Was a royal pain until I bought the Trezor. Now it's a breeze to work with bitcoins, just plug in the Trezor, do the transaction(s), plug it out and go on with my life. No worries anymore about wallet setup, security etc....
Quick and easy and well worth it and I also sleep better :-)

I've always said that the central banks/governments will be the main drivers of crypto adoption. Personally think this is but the start.

You will not get the private key, they do not give private keys out.
What you have at Xapo is not like a normal wallet. All Xapo users essentially share the same wallet. They only allocate you with certain addresses as required i.e. addresses in the wallet are allocated and tied to your name/account. Any funds received on those addresses will be allocated to you but those very same addresses will be used again when somebody else send funds out.
Its for this reason why they will not give you a private key. 
All you need to do is send the funds from Xapo to an address in your Ledger Nano S and that's that.

Not all wallets work the same. Some will show an increased balance when a transaction is received while others will show the transaction amount as unconfirmed until you hit 6 confirmations after which its added to the balance of the wallet.

Its my understanding that this has to do with new EU laws. If this is the case then we can expect other card providers to follow, also, if Visa is doing it now then Master Card is sure to be close on their heels.

I'm actually glad my Xapo card will no longer function after the 15th of Oct. Their service over the past year have honestly become much worse. So much so that I've actually stopped using their card about three months back.
Had great service from my Coinsbank card and never had a single problem in two years. Unfortunately this card will also stop working next month due to the whole Wavecrest thing.
Only other viable option at this stage seems to be Tenx. Signed up but seems like I'll have to wait another 2 to 3 months for the card.

Yes. Works the same as fiat would in your wallet. If you buy something worth $20 but only have a $50 in your wallet you give the whole 50 and get 30 in change.
Bitcoin works the same. When you create a transaction it takes one or more 'inputs' to make up the amount to send. This amount will almost never be the exact amount you want to send so it will take the required inputs and then send the balance to one of your own addresses as change.
You can enable/disable the use of 'change' addresses in the Electrum wallet in the settings. When disabled any change will be sent back to the address you are sending from and not to a new address.

Only drawback of Coinsbank is that they only support BTC and LTC in so far as crypto is concerned but I'm sure they might expand this offering in future. There is also the 3% currency conversion fee if you use the card to pay in a different currency that of the card but at least you get a 0.5% bonus on all purchases which at least help bring this down a bit.
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:48:20
The term wallet is actually 'incorrect'. It should rather be called a key chain because that is actually what it is i.e. a collection of keys/addresses. 
When a wallet is setup you are given a list of seed words which is essentially your master key. All other keys/addresses are derived from that master key.
When using bitcoin you can make use of a single address if you want. It will however compromise your privacy as anybody having your address can view all your transactions. Its for that reason why HD wallets were created so that a new key is used for each new transaction.
If you want to consolidate your wallet a better way of doing it would be to send all funds with each transaction. So say you have 1btc on address A, 0.5 on address B and you need to send say 0.2, you then create a transaction to send the 0.2 to where it needs to go and in the same transaction you send the balance of 1.3 to your next address.

Do yourself a favour and read through the manual. It should not take more than about 30 minutes.
Not being condescending, its just that many people buy the device and it seems like they never read the manual and then come on here to ask some of the most basic questions and often they are given the wrong information.
If you bought a Trezor I assume that you did so as you already have, or plan to acquire, a large amount of crypto and want to keep it safe. If so then reading the manual and familiarising yourself with the device should be the very first step to take. 
Using the device is very easy and straight forward and the manual is easy to understand and follow.

When you select 'Receive' it takes the next address in line. As said, check the address tab, all your addresses are on there. IF you do not see the address tab then click on View--&gt; Addresses.
When you find the address right click on it and select the option to view it online (not sure about he correct wording). This will open the address in a block-explorer. You should be able to see the transaction on there. 
The reason you are not seeing it in your Electrum wallet might be because it is not synced up to date or the transaction has not been broadcast to the servers your Electrum is connected to. It must still come through so you should see it in a while.

More than 90% of traders lose money trading. The 1 or 2% of traders who actually manage to be profitable over the long term, on a consistent basis, usually only achieve this after 3 to 5 years of trading. Trading is not a skill you just pickup overnight and or a skill that somebody else can show you within a matter of a couple of hours.

From a consumers perspective bitcoin is more expensive as there are no fees on cards when making a purchase and there are also hardly any fees to get funds onto a card to make such purchase. With bitcoin the fee is paid by the consumer and there are usually fees involved in obtaining bitcoin in the first place so double fees.
From a merchant point of view bitcoin is much cheaper and well worth it but at this stage large scale adoption have not taken place yet...

**Coinsbank** - Busy with a new issuer to issue cards to international users. Not sure about when 'international' cards will ship for new users as it seems like they are first replacing all cards that stopped working on 15 Oct. They do offer expedited shipping so once you can order you can have your card in a matter of 2 to 5 days.
**Tenx** - Apparently already have a new issuer on board but seems international cards will only ship towards the end of November. No expedited shipping so expect a delivery time of anything from 3 to 6 weeks depending on your country.
**Monaco** - Announcing their VISA (or other) partnership in the next couple of days. According to them will be able to ship international cards. You can sign up already for their different cards. Not sure when and how fast shipping will take.
**METAL** - There is a card in the works but I have not followed them in quite a while so best to check their site for information on the card etc.. Not sure whether they will ship internationally, as said, have not followed in a while but they might be another alternative.

The firmware on the device is signed and the device checks this signature on startup to confirm that the firmware is valid. If a third party flashed their own version of the firmware you will be made aware of the fact that there is a problem with the firmware.

Anything is possible but they will still have to get past the site i.e. the Trezor wallet site. That is where the checking happens when the device interfaces with the site. The site will alert you that the firmware is either incorrect or out of date.

The point I was making was that no site is secure and Reddit is a good example of this as emails are scraped/hacked from the site. That's why I said, use a throw-away address if you do not want your real email addresses compromised.
The fact that you are receiving spam has nothing to do with how secure your own setup is and or whether you used a VPN. That is not where the problem lies, it lies with Reddit itself which is not secure. So as said, treat everything on the internet as 'not secure' until proven otherwise.

If you use a single address then anybody who knows that address can lookup all your transactions on the blockchain. It would be like publishing your bank statements for all to see on the internet.
Using of a single wallet is not a problem IF the wallet is a HD wallet i.e. one that generates a new address for each transaction. I guess what was meant with using one wallet actually meant a wallet with a single address.
Most wallets now are HD wallets so they generate a new address for you for each transaction. This gives you more privacy as the other party to your transaction will only be able to view the single transaction related to the address you are using for that particular transaction. He/she will not be able to see all your other transactions unless this person also know all of your other addresses.
So its all about privacy.

True but with a hardware wallet there is no need to restore and or set it up each time, just plug it in and you are ready to go.
Also, you can never be 100% certain that the environment where you restore your Electrum is safe. With a hardware wallet this is not a problem as it can be used even on computers that are infected with malware.
In regards to your other question, yes, a new address is generated for each transaction as these devices use HD wallets.

Each bitcoin node has a full copy of the bitcoin blockchain. I think there are at present just under 7,000 bitcoin nodes running all over the world. You can also start up a node if you want to.
When you send funds you create a transaction. That transaction gets recorded in the blockchain. Once its recorded your address will be on the blockchain. 
Each wallet service make use of certain servers to which they connect and these servers either run as nodes and or connect to nodes. I'm not technically glued up on this part of things, maybe somebody else can provide more detailed info. Basically your wallets connects to the blockchain through these servers and retrieve all information relevant to your addresses from there.
Forgot: There are people who generate random addresses and then check these for funds. The chances of generating such a duplicate address is however very unlikely. I cannot remember the exact figures but its near impossible to find such a duplicate address.

In the article he predicted that we still had around 6 months left before everything starts to collapse. The article however came out over 4 years ago so we are nearly 4 years past that point.
Not saying the 'big reset' is not going to happen, in my opinion it will. It is however very difficult to predict when this will happen due to the fact that most governments are trying to prevent it by throwing even more money at the problem thus prolonging the inevitable.

Usually works on a first in first out basis so you have to compare each purchase price with its corresponding selling price.
In your case it will be a loss of $2,000 as you take your first purchase of $10,000 as your purchase price. If you sold the other coin as well at the same price it would be a gain of $2,000 giving you a net gain/loss of zero.
Where the headache starts is if you buy say 1 btc and then sell 0.2333 and later another 0.47 etc..... Also, your wallet most probably do not work on a first in first out basis meaning that your actual gain/loss might be different from your from a first in first out calculation.

Many think because they have their funds with a bank/exchange in another country that their own country will not find out about it. If you are one of these people then think again. There are at present over 150 countries who joined the OECD. If you are not familiar with this organisation then you better visit their site and read what it is that they are doing. An area that should concern you most is the automatic exchange of information between these 150 member countries, see link below.
So your country do not even have to ask for any information on its citizens in so far as offshore accounts are concerned, they will be getting all the information they need electronically.

True, you have no control over the private keys of the wallet. They do however remain one of the easiest places for newcomers to go and open a wallet especially if they are not technically inclined.
I often recommend Coinbase to those only starting out with bitcoin but also make sure that I carefully explain the fact that they do not actually control the wallet and that they should move over to a 'private' wallet as soon as they are comfortable doing so.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:57:38
If they have the seed words they will be able to recover the wallet meaning that they will be able to gain access to your coins without the password. The password only protects Electrum meaning that you only need the password to do any transactions on that particular installation of Electrum. You can however recover the wallet on other software with just the seed words.
You should maybe look at investing in something like a Trezor. When you setup the Trezor you can add additional wallets which are protected by a passphrase. In such a case the person will require both the seed words as well as the passphrase because the passphrase is made part of the seed i.e. like a 25th word. Without it you cannot access the passphrase protected wallet.
That means that you will still have time to move your coins should you find out that your seed words were compromised. Just store the seed words and passphrase in different places.

The wallet does not have to know or prove anything. Everything you see in your wallet, i.e. the addresses etc. are derived from the seed. So there is no 'wrong' seed. Anything you type will generate wallets.
To try and simplify, think of it as math like:
3 + 4 = 7
5 + 4 = 9
The 3 and 5 above is the seed. Whatever you type will provide a result but each result will be different if the seed is different. So your wallet does not need to know anything, it takes the input and produces an output.

Every bitcoin address consists of two parts, a public key/address and a private key. Works basically the same as an email address and a password.
You give the public address to people so they know where to send the funds to and you use the private key to access/control the funds.
Without the private key you will not be able to access and send funds from an address. Same as with email, without the password you cannot access the mailbox and cannot send emails.

Just looked this up, if you have been in Cambodia for longer than 182 days in the past year then you are already liable for taxes, so much for the good life.
As stated in my other comment, for this to work you need at least three countries between which to 'rotate' so that you never become resident. It is however important that you scrutinize the relevant tax legislation as there are many pitfalls like for example if you buy a burial plot in certain countries then the courts take that as enough proof of you being a resident or in others if you own property just in one place then that can be enough to classify you as resident even if you do not stay there the whole year.

Yes, if you have the private keys you are able to import them into other applications and thus access your funds. So if the wallet provider shuts down, disappear or stops development on their wallet then you can still get your funds.
If you however do not have the private keys then you will not be able to do this so your funds will disappear with the wallet provider and there is little you can do except for going the legal route in the hope of recovering your funds.

No way to see an escrow address as it is just another address. Escrow usually involves a third party who controls the funds and only releases it if both other parties have fulfilled their obligations in terms of the standing agreement between the parties.

All you need for a backup is the seed words. This is applicable to all versions.
The advantage of the portable version is that it creates all folders and files within the directory from where the exe file is run so it can be used on a USB drive. The other versions create their folders and files in the windows directories.
The portable version is just as secure as the other versions. There are however greater risks involved if you use it on a USB drive and then use the USB drive on other computers which might not be secure. So the warnings in regards to the portable version is to warn users not to use the USB drive on just any computer.

Yes. Making use of three wallets.
1. Default wallet, the one only protected by the pin for my everyday account. Receive almost all funds to this wallet and move it out to wallet 3 asap leaving only small amounts.
2. Passphrase protected wallet with around $150 worth of btc, for 'plausible deniability' type scenario's should I ever need it,
3. Another passphrase protected wallet which is used as my main wallet with more than one account. 98% of funds held here.
Have the same setup as above for eth, ltc, dash on the Trezor.
EDIT: Forgot to add, I also make use of two Trezors. One stays in the safe, the one setup as above, the other one goes with me wherever I go and only a very limited number of coins on there.

There are no guarantees when it comes to any form of investment. I personally do believe that the price still has very far to go over the next couple of years.
You must however remember that nothing moves in a straight line so there is a big possibility that the price will go down and most likely so just after you bought, that is just the way it is.
Best bet is to invest over time, do as you say and just keep on investing what you can spare each month and let it ride. Hopefully in 10 or 15 years from now you will look back thanking yourself for the best decision you have ever made.

"Opendime is a small USB stick that allows you to spend Bitcoin like a dollar bill. Pass it along multiple times. Connect to any USB to check balance."
@_date: 2017-05-10 06:41:54
No its not true, that will be like saying if you keep a dollar in the bank that it will gain more than a dollar held in your wallet. So a bitcoin is a bitcoin, no matter where its kept.
There is no disadvantage of using an 'offline' or your own wallet, it's actually prefered. With online services like for example Coinbase, you do not have control over the private keys of the wallet. This means that if they, for one or other reason, close shop overnight that you will no longer have control over the coins held in that online wallet as you did not have control over the keys of the wallet. You are thus dependant on a third party.
When controlling your own wallet like Electrum that cannot happen. If the developers of Electrum stops all development and or say their software stops working then you will be able to import your wallet into another wallet or other service as you have control over the private keys so you are in full control of the wallet, you are the bank.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:29:16

Yes it works but your main citizenship, or any other you aquire, need to be from countries where their tax system is based on residency and not citizenship.
Secondly, you need to ensure that you do not remain in one country long enough to be classified as a resident in so far as tax legislation are concerned. This usually means that you cannot stay in a country for longer than 6 months a year. Should you do so you will become tax resident and will be liable for taxes.

When you set up the wallet for the first time you are given 24 'seed' words. These you must write down and keep in a safe place.
The 24 words are all you need to recover your wallet. You do not need to write down any public and or private keys, just the 24 seed words.
When you do a recovery you will be asked for the 24 words in a random order. Once you have provided these the public and private keys will be generated from those seed words and the wallet is recovered/restored.

1. Bitcoins are not stored on the Trezor or inside any wallet, online or offline. They are stored on the blockchain as transaction entries like with an accounting ledger. So each transaction is an entry into the ledger stating which address owns what coins.
2. The Trezor/wallet only holds the addresses/private keys proving your ownership and providing you with the necessary control to do transactions, like holding keys for your house. When you connect it to your computer and or the Trezor website it provides the addresses to be checked against the ledger to see the address balances. This is done without revealing your private keys.
3. When you create a transaction this transaction is presented to the Trezor to be signed with the private keys and then returned to the wallet for submission to the miners who will process the transaction and include it in the blockchain i.e. make the necessary entry onto the blockchain to update the ledger. So everything happens on the blockchain.
4. The Trezor site is just an interface for the wallet i.e. it reads the information from the Trezor, addresses etc, queries that on the blockchain and displays the information. All of this is done without ever exposing your private keys to either your computer and or browser etc.. so its secure. No keys are 'stored' online or on the site.
4. When you send bitcoins to your Trezor you are actually sending it to an address held on the Trezor. The actual transaction takes place on the blockchain. When you connect your Trezor, as in 3 above, the information of that transaction will be shown. No need to have your Trezor present or connected in order to receive funds.
Ask away if you have more questions.

In total there is close on a $1,000 in the 'level 2' wallets, each around the $150/$200 mark (btc/eth/ltc/dash). The amounts are not static as I do use the wallets on a regular basis for transactions so yes, I do believe that it is enough for 'plausible deniability' situations.
It might not sound like a lot but in light of the general averages I think it will pass the test. Consider the following ([article/source](








So in light of the above I believe that around $1,000 will pass the test.
The funds on the 'level 3' wallets are very 'static' as I essentially use those for 'cold storage' or long term storage. There is also no direct link in transactions between the level 1/2 and 3 wallets.

Welcome to the world of **'market makers'**, where the market you see is not what you will get and or where what you see is not what's really happening.
A market maker, in the most basic of terms, is your opposition . They take the other side of your trade, that is how the market is 'made'. There is a direct conflict of interest between a market maker and its clients. Their win is your loss and your win is their loss.
Most brokers in the forex industry were market makers but many have now (or in recent years) switched to different models (ECN/STP) where there is no longer a conflict of interest. With these models the brokers are no longer a party to your trade. They just pass your trade through directly onto the markets where it can compete fairly on the open markets.
If you are looking for such an environment I would suggest that you trade btc through one of the established forex brokers and not through these btc exchanges until such time as they implement these same kind of models where there is no longer a conflict of interest.
You must however do your homework, there are still a lot of sharks left in the forex markets.

They will never delete all the account/transaction details and I doubt they are even allowed to do so. Your transaction(s) form part of their business dealings and their financial records which, they as a company, need to account for to the tax people and or regulators just like any other company.
They cannot just go and delete financial records just because you no longer want your name to appear in their database. Doing so would be against the law and would be considered fraud on their side. So whether you like it or not, your transaction history will not be removed.
It's like expecting Visa/MC/your bank to delete records of your card transactions just because you no longer want it to be there on their ledgers.

When you unplug the device while it's connected to the Trezor wallet site there is a dialog box that comes up asking whether the device should be 'Remembered' or not. You most probably clicked on yes resulting in the Trezor site loading with your wallet even if the device itself is not plugged in.
Your wallet is still safe as you will not be able to do any transactions without supplying the pin and passphrase where applicable.

Doubt it will work. Most banks will also require you to disclose the source of the funds and provide some sort of proof. Any discrepancy they pick up will be enough justification for them to freeze the account and any funds in the account.

You don't make sense. You say that your name is tied to the Virwox account and that transactions have been made through that account.
You then say that you do not expect Paypal to remove their records but you do expect Virwox to remove theirs????
Virwox needs to keep records of each and every transaction including the details of the person and or entity who made that transaction so they have to keep a record of your name, just like Paypal keep a record of every transaction you make.

Also have a look at [CoinsBank]( (old Bit-x) which also offers a debit card similar to Xapo.
Difference is that you can link any or all your CoinsBank accounts to the card. This means that you can link your BTC, LTC, USD etc.. account and funds for each swipe will be taken from those accounts.
They also offer a 'cash back' reward on each transaction. Cannot remember all the details and or the amount they give back to you, best to see their site for most up to date details.
Another nice feature they have is the ability to turn the card On and Off on their site and or on the app. Nice additional security feature especially in the times we are living in today. So you can turn the card on, do your transactions and then for extra peace of mind turn it off again afterwards.
**EDIT:** This from their [site]( in regards to the rewards
*For every cent spent on the card we reward you with 10 Satoshi daily. Keep an eye on the exchange rates and count the benefits!*

The main hardware wallets currently in use are the Trezor and the Ledger. I've been using a Trezor for over 2 years now and love it. Have not had a single problem with it in all this time.
If you lose your device or it stops working you just use the seed words to recover the wallets on other compatible wallets i.e. Electrum, MEW etc.. or you can do a recovery on another hardware wallet.

One problem, how do you prove that those address belonged to them? Just because you send me a couple of addresses does not mean they belong to me. In order to do that you need to give them full control i.e. supply the private key as well.
In that case watch them all just cash out, declare the proceeds and laugh all the way to the bank with your money.

Been using both Xapo and Coinsbank for 2 years now without any problems
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:37:36
Well the first is simple i.e. somebody stealing your actual paper wallet. Not everybody using paper wallets encrypt the private keys as they do not want another password to remember so they just print out the paper wallet with no encryption and keep that safe. The result if stolen is that all funds are gone as there were no additional security.
The second has more to do with the procedures involved with setting up a paper wallet or even any other wallet. This does not happen often but I've seen it happen where somebody write down the incorrect seed words and or address. They then wipe their wallets or send funds to the incorrect address only to find out later that they made a mistake and now cannot access the funds.
So more of a 'procedural error' if you can call it that.

Xapo only handles bitcoin. Coinsbank have BTC/LTC/USD(+other fiat) accounts so funds can be held in any of those. Any account, or all of them, can be linked to the card. Transactions will go off the linked accounts.

You are correct, hardware wallets function just like a normal wallet with the exception that the private keys are 'locked-up' inside the device and are never exposed/revealed to the system it's connected to. 
So yes, you can send any amount you want, just like with any other wallet but you can do so without any security concerns i.e. you cannot sweep a paper wallet on an infected computer unless you do not care about the risk of losing everything. You can however use a hardware wallet on an infected computer without a worry in the world.
In regards to which one.... I'm biased, have been using a Trezor for the past two years and have a second one on the way. Never had any problems with the device and will most probably order another Trezor if I need a third. They are robust and very easy to use and I consider it a must have if you are serious about crypto's.

1. If you have access to the wallets transfer everything out to a new wallet.
2. Check all the documents on the drive for any identifying information or maybe put up some fliers on the train/station saying you found it (up to you whether you want to do this but remember, karma is a bitch).
3. Owner should know exact balance or at the very least some detailed transaction information so use that to make sure its the owner before sending the funds back to them. Negotiate a 10 or 20% finder fee/reward.

You have a BTC/LTC/Fiat wallet. I think you can have more than one fiat wallet if not mistaken. Once you have those setup you select which ones to link to the card. You can for example link just your BTC account or say your BTC and LTC accounts.
Any card transaction will be taken from the linked wallets. I'm however not sure in what order this will happen as I have not tried this yet, always just had my BTC wallet linked. 
So idea is that if one wallet is empty that it will take from the next wallet etc..
In regards to the fees. The currency conversion fee is only applicable if there is a need for a conversion i.e. you have a USD card but buy something in EUR. If you have a EUR card and buy something in EUR then there is no currency conversion fee.

Not sure about the Ledger, I have a Trezor and on it the following is supported:
btc, ltc, dash, zec, eth, etc, erc-20 tokens, doge and namecoin.
You can have more than one wallet per coin and each wallet can have more than one account. I think the only limit on the number of wallets/accounts is the memory available on the device.
Also, all wallets can be on the device and active at the same time. Some think that you can only have one coin on the Trezor at a time, this is not the case, all the wallets co-exist on the device at the same time. You just select the coin you want to use from the drop down menu on the Trezor wallet site.

I think your best bet then is CoinTracking. It shows plenty of detail in regards to transactions and also shows you your realised and unrealised gains on purchases and sales etc...
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:23:57
**Example:** You bought 1 x bitcoin for $500. A couple of months later the price is at $2,500. You have an unrealised profit of $2,000. Unrealised meaning it's a paper/book profit which can still change until such time as it is realised.
If you **sell/dispose of** that bitcoin you realise the profit of $2,000. Realised mean that it's now an actual profit and not just a paper or book profit, an actual event took place that realised the profit. At this point you either earned an income or a capital gain. The country you reside in and the applicable tax legislation/regulations will determine which one would apply.
It makes no difference whether you sell the bitcoin on an exchange for USD or whether you use that bitcoin to buy something. The point is that a profit/gain has been realised and because of that a taxable event has occurred.
Many say/believe you have to sell your bitcoin for USD before a taxable event occurs but this is wrong. It has nothing to do with how it was converted but with the fact it was converted to something else.
**EDIT:** Just remember that the opposite also applies. Any losses and expenses (fees, commissions) are deductible. That's why it's important to keep track of everything especially service fees and commissions.
Also, in some countries I know they even go so far as to tax you on the full selling price if you cannot prove what you bought the bitcoin for. Without proof they assume a cost of zero and tax you on the full amount you sold it for. So you better keep any old wallets you used.

True and by whom where they regulated? Who had oversight over these industries and markets?


Yes they did stop a total collapse, for the time being. Have you kept an eye on the markets the past 5 years. Things are unraveling. The patches they placed on the dam wall is not holding. As said, nothing was resolved. The US fed came in with trillions of fictitious money covering over the holes but the patches are not holding. Like a house of cards standing in front of an open window with a storm approaching. And it's not just the US, the EU is a close second.
To make a long story short, this point is debatable. Yes they did prevent a financial collapse, but was it the right thing to do in the way it was done?? We can go on for months and still not agree. Fact is that they have devalued their currencies to a level where its worthless through their reckless actions. In short, we are paying the price for their actions.


I agree but when this same great power starts to disregard the rights and freedom of its own citizens and or use that power to interfere with almost every other country then it becomes a problem. Not sure whether you are from the US but if so then you just need to look around you, you are already living in a police state. You have already lost your freedom.

Easiest way I know is to make use of Electrum. Create a watch-only wallet with the xpub key from your Trezor. Once done enable the historical prices plugin on Electrum. This will show you the price at time of transaction in the history/transaction tab next to each transaction.
You can export the transactions to a csv file but unfortunately the historical prices do not get exported. Asked for them to be included in the export almost a year ago but seems like it's not a high priority for the developers of Electrum.

That other 0.1% of the time is far safer than any other wallet which is essentially online the whole time as it's on a machine connected to the internet. Also, the device is never truly online. Your wallet creates the transaction and sends it to the hardware wallet for signing. The signed transaction is then returned to the wallet. Similar as to what you would have done when using an online and offline wallet.
Also, the coins you say you would rather keep offline have to be swept into a wallet if you ever want to use them meaning that they could be compromised during the sweeping or the wallet you use may be compromised. With a hardware wallet you never need to do this so your chances of it being compromised are magnitudes lower than with a paper or any other wallet.
Also, the software used to create a paper wallet can more easily be compromised than the firmware running on a hardware wallet. Yes one can check the code but are they ever digitally signed after being checked? With hardware wallets each firmware update is digitally signed so you are sure that it has not been tampered with in any way. The device is also able to detect any firmware that is not properly signed and warns you about this.
I know nothing is foolproof but I would, and I am, trusting a hardware wallet far more than I trust any kind of other wallet, whether online or offline. There is at present just no better balance between security and usability than that you get from using a hardware wallet.

Look at TenX. Only card that has no currency conversion fee so around 3% cheaper than other cards. It also offer rewards of 0.1% on all purchases. Not sure about limits though. 
I have a Xapo and Coinsbank cards. Both have decent limits of $20k purchases per day and $2k ATM withdrawals per day and no lifetime limits (if verified). Both cards are directly linked to your wallets so your coins are only converted to fiat at time of purchase. You don't need to load these cards, just send btc to your wallet.
Xapo only works for bitcoin. Coinsbank for bitcoin and litecoin. TenX will support more, think btc, ltc, dash and all tokens if not mistaken.

I would not send any funds to the wallets after creation. The reason being that you should consider the wallet as compromised once you have done a recovery.
I would suggest that you do as you say, create some wallets and recover them. Also create passphrase protected wallets to see how they work. When doing the recovery do a recovery on the Trezor and also try to recover your wallet on say Electrum and MEW.
Once done wipe the device and create a completely new wallet. Make 150% sure you have your seed words written down correctly and then use those wallets in future.
Don't use the wallets you practised on again, consider them as compromised. 
Also, don't use the same passwords. Keep your 'real' passwords for the 'real' wallet. While testing just use simple passwords for the testing phase.

Jaxx is a neat wallet but some security issues came to light like the one about the seed words which could be extracted.
From what I've read it seems like this exploit is only possible if somebody has access to your computer. Not trying to say that it is not something that should seriously be looked into but if somebody gains access to your computer you are screwed on many others levels.
Last reply I've seen from a Jaxx person was that there is a new security framework being worked on. If all the security concerns are addressed through this then I'll make use of Jaxx again as a daily wallet. They have great plans for the wallet with future integrations so I honestly hope they can get these security issues sorted. 
In answer to your question..... Guess we will have to wait and see what fixes are released and take it from there. Until then I'm not using it.

When using a Trezor it's not necessary to have an online and offline wallets. The Trezor device is secure and it's essentially offline 99.9% of the time so it is basically an 'offline wallet'. The only time its online is when you plug it in to do a transaction. When you do all your private keys etc.. are protected by the device and it's never revealed to your computer so you are still safe.
When you set up a Trezor wallet on Electrum the wallet is a watch-only wallet as there are no private keys in the wallet. The private keys are on the Trezor device. So in effect what you end up with is your Trezor as the 'offline' wallet and your Electrum wallet as the 'online' wallet.
You can watch all transactions on Electrum but you cannot create any transactions. In order to create a transaction you need to plug the Trezor in which will then sign the created transaction. 
In regards to Electrum - you do not have to use Electrum, the Trezor wallet site is more than capable to handle everything you throw at it. Also, Electrum can only do bitcoin whereas the Trezor wallet site handles all the other coins supported by the Trezor.
I used to make use of offline/online wallets but it became a real headache resulting in me buying a Trezor. The whole aim of a Trezor is to simplify things without giving up any security. So you really do not need all these offline/online wallets when you have a Trezor.
Not sure if this answers your questions, if not please ask away, I'll try and explain it better.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:17:25
Electrum used to support multiple accounts per wallet. From version (I think) 2.7 onwards this is no longer the case. If you have multiple accounts in a wallet on your Trezor then you have to set them up individually on Electrum. So each account becomes a separate wallet.
Both Trezor and Electrum are still safe.

In order for a wallet to be updated it needs to go online.
What you need to do is have an online watch-only wallet and an offline wallet. You can do this with Electrum.
Use your Trezor and Electrum on the offline machine to setup your wallet. Once done copy the master public key and use this to setup a watch-only wallet on an online machine. You can then use the watch-only wallet to check your wallet and to get your addresses. 
If you need to do a transaction you create the transaction on the watch-only wallet and once done save it to a USB device. You then load this transaction on the offline machine and have it signed by the Trezor/Electrum. Once signed you save it again and then import the transaction on the online wallet which then broadcasts the transaction to the network.

With that said, don't write off Jaxx. Do a search on Jaxx and read what people have to say about the security exploit. Try and read through all the 'hype' about the problem. From what I could see it does not seem to be as serious as some make it out to be.
Don't make a mistake, it's serious BUT, certain things need to be in place for the exploit etc.. to work. Like me stealing your car. It's a risk but I first need to get to where your car is before I can even attempt to steal it. 
Not suggesting you ignore the warnings and not suggesting you use Jaxx. I am however suggesting that you read everything you can about it. I still think it's a good wallet and think it will become one of the best wallets as well as one of the most used wallets in future.
I've stopped using it as I have a Trezor which is my main wallet. Jaxx was always just a 'daily use' wallet which I used with small amounts. I've stopped using it but still have some funds on it. I'm waiting to see what updates come out and will then make a final call.

Would be nice to have such a wallet but doubt one exist (yet). The two wallets currently supporting the most coins are Coinomi and Jaxx but neither have a watch-only feature.
If looking at current roadmaps then it seems like Jaxx wants to take over the world. Posted on their blog about some major integrations of almost every coin as well as hardware wallets.
If I have to venture a guess then I would say that they will be the ones who will get closest to your needs, not now though, but maybe in future. Just a pity about the security issues but they are apparently working on a complete new security framework for the wallets.

Not sure, I always just used the function on the Trezor wallet site. Go to the 'Advanced' tab, you will see 'Wipe Device towards the bottom of the page.

If you started buying 5 years ago your average cost should be pretty low, that is, if you did not end up buying the bulk at the highs of last year. If that is the case you should already be close to 500%.
With that said, waiting another 5 years to see if you achieve 500% is honestly not something I'm at all interested in, who cares, there's no skill involved or anything that I can learn from it. Not trying to be condescending but buying something and hoping it works out is something any of the 7 billion people on earth can do so sad to say, it make you no more special than anybody else.
If you were actively trading to make that 500% then maybe you might have something to share.
And just for the record, I've been buying in since 2011.

A hardware wallet would be ideal. The ones on offer at present unfortunately do not store a large number of different coins so they might not work for you. I would however get one and store what I can on it.

**Short answer:** Get a hardware wallet. It's a no brainer.
**Long answer:** See below:
The choice between a paper wallet (PW) and a hardware wallet (HW) will mostly depend on your own personal circumstances. There is no 'one fits all' answer to this question. With that said, look at the following, hope it helps:
* Many consider PW's to be the safest way to store crypto's. The main reason for this is because PW are considered what is referred to as 'cold storage' i.e. stored offline. PW are however not risk free. There are risks involved when creating them, storing them and also when you extract your funds from them. You need to make sure that you know what you are doing especially when you create them and also when you extract your funds from them. You have to familiarize yourself with all the possible risks involved, failing to do so could result in you losing all your funds, either through possible theft or just because you did something wrong resulting in your funds getting tied up on an address you do not have the private keys for.
* HW, in my opinion, are much safer than PW. With a HW wallet you have the best balance between security and usability. You do not have the same risks associated with a PW and most of the HW's are essentially idiot proof meaning that it's far easier to setup and use. You can use a HW, like Trezor, on an infected computer without worrying about security. You can use it at an internet cafe without you having to worry about malware and the like. Your funds are always readily available and all it takes is a couple of clicks and you are done. You can use it on your desktop as well as on your phone. No jumping through hoops, booting up with linux, using offline computers only etc... Just plug it in, do what you need to do and plug it out, as easy as that. There is no risk to your funds should the device fail as you can recover your funds on any other compatible wallet or on a new device.
If you are only looking at moving funds to an address and leaving it there for years then a paper wallet might work for you. If you however plan to use crypto's on a more regular basis then get a hardware wallet. You can use the same device for long term holdings because you can have multiple wallets and within each wallet multiple accounts. So its easy to setup a daily account, one for work, a savings, a long term savings etc....
If the world was a safe place we would all just store all our money at home. The reality however is that there will ALWAYS be somebody who will try and take away from you whatever you have. Its for this reason why we take any and all steps to secure our money and one of them is to place the money in a bank. Banks make use of several different layers of security to protect your money. You might not even know or be aware of all these layers as most are invisible to the normal bank client. We just stick our cards in an ATM and a minute later we have cash in hand.
With crypto's there is no bank on who's expertise you can rely to protect your funds. You need to do all this yourself which makes things quite a bit more difficult. You need to make sure that you know your way around a computer in terms of security and that your computer is safe. Malware and targeted attacks will get more and more sophisticated as the price of crypto's rise. You will have to keep abreast with these new developments and best security practices at all times. You need to constantly double check everything you do when it comes to crypto's as any wrong step can compromise your holdings.
Or, you can just get  a hardware wallet and sleep better. Its worth it. It will be the best investment you have ever made. I've been using a Trezor for over two years and still think its the best investment I've made. So much so that I now have two and will most probably get any new version when it comes out. I'm done with all the paper wallets, offline wallets, malware protection and the like.

Would be nice to see it on something like Metatrader but guess it's not going to happen anytime soon as.

Best is to do your own research on both. I've been using Trezor devices for about three years now so anything I say will be biased towards them as I'm very happy with my two Trezors. Have not had a single problem in the past three years.
Many will say the same about Ledger devices. Never had one and never used one so cannot comment on it. I do however believe that they are just as good.
In my opinion either will be a good buy.
