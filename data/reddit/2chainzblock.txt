Do your research, tether is about to collapse: 
Not knowing things that should be common knowledge in the world of cryptocurrency takes away from your argument 
All CRYPTO'S FALL WHEN BIT COIN FALLS BECAUSE THEIR VALUE IS CORRELATES WITH THE VALUE OF BITCOIN.
Good luck with your theories.

Roger Ver is such a dork with his BCash. He copied the name from ZCash

Thanks for the explanation. So what happens if you are on the bar tab and you haven't settled yet, but in-between you make a purchase and empty your wallet. Does the bar tab reserve your owed amount at the bar instantly? 
and when the bar processes a batch do they pay the regular bitcoin transaction fees?

So which legitimate alt didn't dip with bitcoin? The USD Tether scam that's not actually backed up with actual currency?? :)

they all get their value from bitcoin or ethereum.
I was right about ripple just look at my other posts. I called it would burst a few days before it did.

thats awesome news. so the question is how, when and if it will be adopted universally? this isnt any kind of fork, is it a change to the repository?
