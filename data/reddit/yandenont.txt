3d printing and bitcoins have something in common. Something that can make the whole world change. So it's nice you're trying to combine it.

I don't think BTC atms are of much use now, however its bringing  public attention only, bringing BTC to mainstream

OpenBazaar seems to be a promising project. I still miss BitMit and think there is ample opportunity for new auction/listing-services in the bitcoin space.
However it's imperative that these new services focus on essential functionality and make participation as easy as possible - because most important for such services to succeed is ample participation by both sellers and buyers (the latter being even more important).

Why they should buy blockchain, I think that they will adopt bitcoin but won't buy any websites about it.

I don't see any harm that IRS can bring - O think it's a positive changing Bitcoiis going to be legal and that's good!

We should pay anonymous to DDOS them for a year.
Shame we can't use old miners to do this, ban BTC we attack you.

Etsy is the hosting website for independent vendors. View of this it will not be a problem!

I don't think he will under that alias ever. He seems like a very reclusive guy and doesn't want much light on himself.

Pricing things in fiat is easier for everybody. If I want £10 in btc for something the btc at the time I listed it might be worth more or less a few minutes later so you peg it to your currency of choice for convinience and simplicity.

I swear that I'll be there! What do you think how many people will gather?

Maybe I didn't get you right but what I have read here is close to the definition 'paper wallet'

As for me I have lots of time convinced that despite graphics shows some predictions there is always a big chance to another destination than usual (traditional) one accroding to theories and graphics

only time machine can help you to become a millionaire by farming BTC. no kidding :D

I think it's pretty effective marketing strategy. By the way it adresses to those who use dollars, not 100s.

Bitcoin Foundation, what had it done from inception to the present?
