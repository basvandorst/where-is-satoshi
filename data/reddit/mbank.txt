maher was supporting the nsa and against snowden back when that was a position to be had during the earlier days. not surprised hes dropped the ball on bitcoin too.

someone killed themselves because of this?
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:17:01
i like this idea. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:27:24
cash 10 mil for seans outpost though

(assuming this article is true which i do not believe) your wrong and gavin is wrong. the middle ground is that satoshi used his name in the whitepaper, therefore he has no reasonable expectation of privacy. if he had used an pseudonym then i would say he could claim some privacy, but its his responsibility, and he should have prepared for journalists. if its feasibly possible to find satoshi, then he deserves to be found for hiding himself so badly.

damn i love that tea. oi ocha. mm been a while since i had some, think ill pick some up today on the way home. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:32:48
thats a lot of white people
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:41:23
why assume he lost the keys? i don't think it is logical to make that assumption without any evidence, even if he has 250k coins and he needs 750k he is still in a lot of shit, in fact that may be motivation for market manipulation, although the fact the coins are still in old addresses sort of goes against that

very good, informative video, i hope this gets to the top of the page and maybe he will see it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:46:02


the reasonable conclusion would be the regulation was not enforced well which allowed him to do that... you have to separate regulation in practice from regulation in theory, no one is claiming regulation would prevent all cases of fraud everywhere. regulation is more for systematic fraud, madoff was more of a rogue criminal
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:28:16
even if its fake she got bitcoin in headlines, so good job leah
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:35:03
satoshi left that email address a long time ago, its in the whitepaper not a secret
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:55:20
ok, so corrupt regulation does not work, i agree. that doesnt mean good regulation wouldnt.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:43:08
if i was in the area id take him to lunch.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:59:21
my position is that the real satoshi cannot be found. not that he should or shouldn't be, i dont think it matters because if he did things right, he literally cannot be found with any reasonable amount of resources. if he can be found, then he should be. bitcoin is optional by the way, he is not forcing anything onto you.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:47:25
that third possibility is certainly bleak, however i think the blowback against the feds, if they were to do this, would be significant, and i dont think karpeles would fuck up his reputation to protect the feds
@_date: 2014-02-03 00:53:59
i didnt, sounds like they said that the nsa is used to get economic information so that they can make... effective i guess is the word..  sanctions for iran and others
they use the nsa to fuck up the economies of countries they dont like
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:54:06
not unless he signs a message do i believe it. accounts get hacked pretty easily.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:08:27
ok, this is now IMO ++90% chance of being hacked. ning AND bitcointalk were recently hacked.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:08:16
ok, what percentage did you lose? i don't agree with his argument about this by the way, however i thought it was known you had 100k+ coins
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:50:26
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:44:21
it doesnt prove it but it suggests it
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:36:36
i agree a little, the pibture of the house was just stupid, BUT, come one, if this is satoshi, he did nothing to protect his identity, i cant really think of him as a victim of obtrusive journalism when he publishes something with his real name and is then tracked down
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:47:49
whats irresponsible is posting this without any real evidence - the house picture is available on google maps and anyone who thinks that was crossing a line is delusional
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:22:07
this is so entertaining. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:53:20
translation: they (top 80 elite who are supposedly worth more than the rest of us, who legally bribe assholes like this senator) are scared of losing control of their hostages to an economic system of stratification
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:17:46
yep. its been a hilarious contest of misinformation on all sides.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:36:32
If your birth name was Satoshi Nakamoto, what are the chances you or someone you know will google your name over the years after 2009? (especially someone with a supposed family lineage he may have been interested in, and computer nerd coworkers/friends). hell, what are the chances a computer related person with that name wouldnt find out about bitcoin early? and if you did, you would be interested because you have a rare name and someone with the exact same name is famous, and you would find more about it. dorian nakamoto is most likely a case of this. he may have paid for that house with bitcoin, been seen at bitcoin meetups, etc. its because he was lucky enough to have the same name that the 'real' satoshi used, so he found out about bitcoin early. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:46:36
support! we just need the exchanges to switch and everyone else will. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:39:31
never assume conspiracy for what can be easily explained with incompetence
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:37:31
This guy took every step to not be in the shit storm he is about to be a part of. 
by using his real name?
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:34:27
agreed, if this dude is satoshi, which i don't think he is, he deserves to be found for using his real name. better by a journalist than a cartel member, it would have happened eventually
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:27:57
theres no evidence either way yet
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:32:26
i dont think its boring, i have been laughing my ass off all day. what you probably mean is its not a financially motivated means of using it, to which i agree that it would be strange for hackers to do this instead of say putting up a donations address and making a nice $10-30k. however i was thinking, since the bitcoin talk database was leaked, its possible satoshi's encrypted password was out there. now, a "team" of sql injecting teenagers are not going to be cryptography experts. its possible some more serious person who knows what they are doing and would not have immediate financial incentive decrypted his password. ive seen a guy decrypt passwords that i gave him randomly on certain forums who was VERY skilled, these were complex md5 passwords that were not yet known etc. there are people with skill out there is my point.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:31:29
agreed 100%, though i would say the journalist shouldn't have presented it like there was definitive proof. there isnt, yet, though it does look convincing.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:48:01
you get it man.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:35:25
what a fail at trashing regulation, especially ironic considering lack of regulation allowed this to happen. your argument against regulation could be applied against any authority including government, do you support anarchy? the selective application of logic and huge lack of consistency on all issues by right wingers never ceases to amaze me. 
your a nice (although overly sentimental and grandiose) writer but what you just wrote about regulation is nuts. its crazy, and thankfully your in the vast minority of elitists who can convince themselves of this sort of ideology. 
i could understand if you proposed an argument saying regulation in practice tends to not work well or in an ideal way. but to be completely against authority of any kind, even democratic authority (were talking about in theory here), is fucking stupid and crazy. maybe you were stressed while writing this, and i still enjoy reading your posts and think you can be a good advocate for bitcoin. but this specific paragraph is not cool and its one of the problems with the bitcoin community, although thankfully it seems you are losing the battle and bitcoin businesses become more legitimate and regulated like they are doing in NY and i believe California too.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:34:53
no, and its more difficult
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:50:38
no signature, no satoshi!
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:42:44
not happening, ever
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:41:31
your argument assumes this is the real satoshi, which i contend is far from proven fact.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:14:37
not sure why you got downvoted bro but i agree with you, it seems quite likely anyone with the name satoshi nakamoto who is not the creator of bitcoin would have heard about bitcoin early on just because their name is rare and they would have seen it on google. its the most plausible theory out of all the other stuff i have heard so far.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:28:40

i think the reason is the btc market is pretty small, people who would actually buy that can afford $100 generally(with the wealth disparity in the world there is no market for "middle ground" products, either really high end or really low end stuff is whats profitable), but its a good idea and i will look into it more
im trying to think about something that would, once you load BTC onto it, only allow them to be withdrawn/private key accessed if a button was pushed a certain way on it
i do agree that this would help adoption though, we need something so easy to use people can no longer say "its too technical" as an excuse not to get involved in btc
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:45:06
im having fun too man, dont get me wrong. however if you want to see why it think its quite plausibly not him(besides of course the bitcointalk admins or p2p admins could be doing this, but assuming thats not the case), 
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:49:43
i agree. it was satoshi's responsibility to maintain his anonymity, not that of journalists to shield his publicly available information from us.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:35:41
it is official, karpeles said it was real..
