Because these people don't know how to trade at all.

I'm apart of a trader group and on multiple occasions we've experienced terrible fills and one time couldn't even sell a 3x Leveraged ETF we purchased. Went to close the position and the order's literally wouldn't go through. Called customer service and not only were they rude they didn't do anything about it. We ended up losing about 7% on a trade that would have been profitable if we could sell because by the time their system was working properly again the ETF was trending down intraday. ( Just 1 example from my group out of many, and many other people I don't know also have issues with them.) If you're just buying and selling and don't mind using a discount broker with non existent customer service than Robinhood may work for you but if you're a serious investor or active trader it's just not worth the liability. Much better to pay a little bit and use a legitimate broker.

Buy at a discount? lol. This isn't a discount if ( and it will ) go down another 50/70%. THAT will be the discount, not this.

Duh. Nobody uses market order's. Their limit order's have shit fills. There's a reason it's a free platform.

If you're a day trader or swing trader, technical analysis is key. If you're an INVESTOR fundamental's are key.

You do realize you only commented only a tiny fraction of my post? Guess the rest is too complicated for you to understand.

LMAO. Meanwhile you're still going through broker's to buy/sell Bitcoin and people are using margin/leverage from banks and their broker's to buy/sell.

Robinhood has a long history of being a shit broker. I'd stay away. They have terrible fills and seriously the worst customer service ever. Just check reddit if you don't believe me, so many complains about their platform.

What's your point? There's way more volatile equities on Robinhood then a 3x ETF. If anything 3x ETF are easy to track due to the correlations to USD/Interest rates/ news , etc. We were testing the platform and as expected Robinhood performed terribly ( worse than we expected ). Like I said, if you're just trying out investing and not serious about it Robinhood should be fine. However, if you're using anything above a tiny size of funds, it's a horrible discount broker.

Wow, you can quote Warren Buffet. I'm so impressed.  
  


A 60% discount is nothing when technical's show this is nowhere near the bottom. You buy at the bottom for a discount / dead cat bounce. This is still trending down hard. Not the time to buy yet, you said yourself be patient. Follow your own advice would ya'? Bitcoin is still on the way down, buying now is foolish, buying when it's at the bottom and being patient for it to get there is the right play.
