Bitcoin is skynet. First it takes over our finances then destroys us.

If you have a group agreeing to a shared goal why use a bloackchain instead of a traditional database? If you have a goal that does not include decentralization, a blockchain becomes pretty useless compared to existing tech. Furthermore, the security of the blockchain would then be based on trust which again makes no sense. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:45:52
Quit trolling. Your post history shows you think BTC will go to zero and Bcash will grow. Grow up.

Tf you talking about?
@_date: 2018-09-16 03:27:40
How do you have distributed data without the monetary reward of running the blockchain? What is the incentive? A blockchain is a horrible database. Its use is in decentralization which I dont see how it comes about without the underlying currency. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:57:05
Looks like you have this problem a lot. Might want to lean how do do it correctly next time. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 14:50:58
I dont know why you are being downvoted to shit. Obviously crypto and blockchain are separable but then you are sacrificing a distributed ledger. The decentralized nature of a blockchain does not exist without incentive for miners. No decentralization means it would be built on trust when the entire point is for blockchain to be trust less. If you remove decentralization and the trust less environment you may as well use traditional databases since blockchains are awful databases. Maybe I am mistaken but that is my understanding. Rebukes?

That is just shark tank talk. If you have demand you expand

Considering that I have to look myself in the mirror every day, yes. I would without question turn over 40k.
To be fair I am in the (low end of the) 1% so 40k isn’t life changing money. 
Altruism does not exist but I try.
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:11:50
Yes which is why I mentioned it. NOT as a humble brag. 
There is a scale of  “dickness”
Dick move  ~ guy that makes minimum wage or jobless
Dick~ guy that makes 40k
Complete dick~ guy that makes 100k
Absolute Dick~ guy that makes 250k
Utter scumbag piece of shit~ Over 250k
Assuming you do not know the person you are taking it from you have to concede they are most likely a member of the middle class to upper middle class since by definition most people are not in the 1% and I am assuming if you have 40k you are in that range. With this information, it was a whole years salary.
If you were able to know the position of the person you are taking it from, say you knew that 40k was all they had  s 40k being meaningless to that person it changes the “dickness” scale.
I do not believe in absolute morality for this reason. The same action can be on a different level of morality depending on circumstance.
@_date: 2019-08-05 04:48:37
Low end of the 1% which is 250k+

I would be willing to pay $200 to find a person that would give $200 back in that situation. Call me a cynic, but I believe most people would just take the money and justify it to themselves easily.

Embrace the fees. Incentive for miners to keep mining after halvening compared to the other shit coin.

@_date: 2019-08-04 17:30:28
For comparison purposes it would be nice to know what % of fiat transactions are illicit. 
Transaction volume and overall volume are good metrics to know too. Maybe 2% of transactions and amount to 1% volume, maybe 50% of volume. A single metric is a poor data point for any type of conclusion.
@_date: 2019-02-07 13:12:13
How dare you.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:54:33
Do your own research is ALWAYS a bullshit response. You are making a claim you provide the source. Otherwise you sound like a moron. 
@_date: 2019-06-12 01:29:41
Other coin is a shit coin. Why the fuck would anybody keep mining it after the halvening? Can’t earn trans fees so they rely on the block reward.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:48:37
If BTC goes to 87k it’s going to have more than 46% dominance. Otherwise a RETARDED amount of money would be pumped into alts.

If you believe in the tech, or company, or person, you invest in them. The price means nothing. You buy on the way down and you buy on the way up. Pricing is a market trying to make money short term which almost nobody is good at. If you buy or sell something based on how others value it you are guaranteed to get wrecked at some point.

Your comment is pathetic. Somehow my view tells you I have a one bedroom shack? If bitcoin went to $1000 I would still have more money than your entire family. Same idiots that think it will go up forever at ATH show up saying it will go down forever when we are low. Learn how to actually make money instead of being an emotional sheep. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:35:18
If you dont have a solid idea of what you expect it to be worth you should not buy or sell. Do you expect me to be able to tell you?

We had a huge drop in difficulty with this latest adjustment. What would happen if all the hash power came back once the difficulty was decreased but leave again when difficulty goes up without the price of bitcoin moving? Wouldn't that create super long blocks for the following weeks since those miners would then be gone? 
I'm wondering if huge miners buy and sell in huge blocks in order to drive the market like the FED does to curb or increase inflation. I would assume if this was the case the price would bounce upwards over the next two weeks up to the next adjustment. Thoughts? Maybe I'm missing something since I'm no expert.
