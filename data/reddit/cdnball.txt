That might require drilling into the front ‘bumper’. This plate might be mounted on a bracket attached back in through the hole on the right (car’s left)

FYI they can pass new laws, and add new taxes. Someone has to pay for police, schools, and roads, so there will be taxes.

Why would it be out of reach? New investors just get smaller portion of a coin, yet they are still 'worth' more because the price went up. It's a currency meant to be spent.

They all use debit cards now. That took quite awhile. Ya who knows. My plan is to invest no more than I can afford to lose and then hold long term, then if mass adoption happens, I’ll be looking at a nice, comfortable retirement. Also disclaimer, I only started buying in a month ago. Still learning

when bottom?
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:26:30
how long ago? and do you think things (the bickering and payment issues) are getting better at all?

But that's your circle of friends. Do you hang out with mostly tech-savvy people? Younger, educated people? My circle is much more rural, and on the older side (over 40). I don't know how many people I know, but let's say it's around 1,000. (500 'friends' on facebook, plus the rest of the acquaintances in my life). I know 3 of the 500 own crypto, but there's maybe 10-15 more in my whole circle (1,000) that own as well. So let's be generous and say it's 25 out of 1000 or 2.5%. Also, the people I know haven't _really_ invested. It's a few hundred dollars here and there. 
I think it will take a long time for that percentage to go up, but when (if) it ever makes it over 50%, with people using bitcoin in their day-to-day lives (10 years from now? 20?), us early adopters will be rewarded.

Bitcoin should take the angle off their logo. It would make the angled one of bcash look more like a knockoff

20? Wow. Didn’t realize. I got in in April after the craziness died down. I’m down about 10%. So about 1-2 years of growth to make that back. Plus I entered with caution as I saw how risky it is. I’m probably quite a bit more risk averse than your average crypto investor

We are only 6 months past massive hype. Give it some more time. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:13:04
I don't think it will bounce up. There will be spikes up and down, but overall a slow steady rise.

In my circle it barely registered. It was something that made the news but nobody understood it. It needs like 10 years.

Agggh don’t broadcast that, bro! Whatever you do, keep them off exchanges. There are millennials out there that will steal them.

As a Canadian who bought last night - guilty :)
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:57:05
that's your take. other people will act on their own opinions. right now, I agree that most people would consider crypto even riskier that stock market.
