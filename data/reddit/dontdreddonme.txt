Bitcoin is basically useless as a currency especially proportionate to its insane energy costs

I'm not a greenie, bitcoin is just a disaster ponzi scheme

Those things can be used to produce things, they don't literally do useless work.

Energy harvesting requires expenditure and energy storage and use requires expenditure. Bitcoin is literally useless expenditure.

Just more astroturfing to make Trump unimpeachable

Yes, rough language is my soft spot, Ponzi guy.

Gold isn't useful? You're using gold to talk to me about your Ponzi scheme right now.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:41:31
You're using gold to type your nonsense right now.

Half a percent of human output doing absolutely nothing and requiring ecological disasters to produce the video cards and computer parts your useless Ponzi scheme drives the price of.

Energy use out of all proportion to its use as anything other than speculation. For quick dollars:

Chicken bones

Hot tubs are not .5% of human energy, hot tubs also relieve muscle spasms. Ponzi scheme transactions are useless work.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:46:31
So you agree bitcoins are ecological and social disasters that are valuable purely from speculation?
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:35:47
Exactly why people think you people are irresponsible morons

Bitcoin is not a global currency because 99% of people can't use it for 99.99999% of transactions. It's only value is agreement by the people mining it and is backed by nothing. It's useless work so speculative investors can make money.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:43:21
The process of bitcoin creation is literally useless work.
