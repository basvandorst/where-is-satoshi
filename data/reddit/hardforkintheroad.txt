No. After the halving miners will only be making 1800 BTC a day. Assuming they all neglected their bills and held those BTC, that's still only 1800 BTC - a small fraction of daily selling volume. There are other sources of supply than the block reward. 
If everybody just holds and doesn't actually spend of use Bitcoin then nobody sees the utility in them and the price ultimately drops. Currency only has value when you can actually spend it places and at such an early stage it's a dangerous idea to suggest people stop actually using it at retail and just hold them.

So you're literally just making up an estimate that assumes the highly competitive Bitcoin mining industry operates at a 70% profit margin?  If it were so profitable don't you think mining would be less centralized?  
I'd be interested to read the reports you reference. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 19:36:20
and years after release Bitcoin still has very few merchants accepting it - most of the ones that do only do so via an intermediary that ultimately provides them fiat. 
So why exactly are these merchants who don't accept bitcoin going to be expected to accept LN transactions? 
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:02:34
Assuming a conservative 3% fee on 1000 transactions with an average of, let's say $4 per transaction, that's $0.12 per transa tion in fees and a total of $4000 in revenue and $120 in fees
Now, six bitcoin sales with the same average. Total revenue was a measly $24. Maybe he saved a whole $0.72 in fees but obviously he can't live off of $24 in revenue. 
My point is that fees mean very little when the customers aren't there. A retailer paying 3% or even 5% fees accepting credit cards will do much better than a bitcoin accepting retailer paying no fees simply because of the larger customer base. 
@_date: 2016-04-18 21:31:35
It absolutely matters when the USD movement of each is wildly different. You have to consider what the percentages actually represent. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 21:04:49
No, it won't, because merchants have proven they have no interest in receiving BTC. Have you noticed the abrupt stop in merchant acceptance?  Why would they give two shits about the "Lightning Network" when Bitcoin proper brought in next to no salsa? 
@_date: 2016-04-17 23:57:55
Here's the problem - consumerism is about *the consumers*. Nobody rightly gives a fuck about merchant fees because the shopping experience is about consumer convenience. If people cared about merchant fees they wouldn't use credit cards, but their competition accepts them and it's supremely convenient *for the consumer* so they have no choice. 
Something like OB which favors the merchant at the expense of consumer convenience will never see success. That's simply not how our economy works, high fees or no. 
A merchant paying no fees on OB will ultimately make less money than the merchant paying "excessive fees" to EBay for their enormous customer base... At which point the fees don't seem so excessive.

@_date: 2016-04-13 22:35:50


Nah, they won't, because Bitcoin users have undoubtedly proven that they don't care to spend Bitcoin at retail, which is why places like OkCupid dropped support and you essentially never hear about new retailers deciding to accept. 
You can pretend that all these retailers are going to hop on once Bitcoin has scaled but that's just kidding yourself. Retailers aren't interested in accepting Bitcoin, the userbase is tiny and stagnant and stingy. Facts. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 11:46:53
Are you being naive on purpose or what?  Obviously there is a lot more supply than the 3600 coins produced each day, the 1800 less coins not being sold are not what's holding the price back from doubling today. Bitcoin transaction volume is buying and selling, the selling part of which makes up a supply. When you buy Bitcoin you aren't buying them directly from miners, you are likely buying them through a service that interfaces with the exchanges to acquire coins. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 10:59:21
It sounds like that transaction took 15x longer than an NFC payment with a debit or credit card. If you think 30 seconds is the "most perfect payment in your whole life" you ain't seen nothing yet. 
I'm not trying to troll you or anything but seriously there's nothing better for consumers then tap-to-pay. It takes literally two seconds. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 21:22:28
First of all, of merchants are saving fees, why would they necessarily immediately give the savings away?  I would think they would, at the very least, pocket 5% and then offer a 5% discount
Next, and as was already mentioned, EBay brings millions and millions of shoppers to your product. A merchant who pays 10% to sell hundreds of items will make more money than a merchant who pays 0% but sells 1 or 2. 
How are OB merchants supposed to advertise?  How can other merchants see the total sales volume and participation on OB to get an idea if its worth it?  
@_date: 2016-04-05 23:04:42


Not really? 
The "fractals" you're identifying are far from perfect patterns, history doesn't necessarily dictate the future and the dynamics of Bitcoin have changed considerably since the last pattern of yours. 
It's incredibly easy to deny that there's some repeating fractal dictating the price of Bitcoin independent of any other news affecting consumer opinions and adoption

The mortgage crisis has absolutely nothing to do with this but wicked hyperbole bro 


Who are you to declare what technology can and can't be used for?  Do you have more qualifications and credibility than the people working at Nasdaq and Intel and IBM?  Fucking no, you obviously don't. Blockchain don't need to be public or called "Bitcoin" in order to be a Blockchain. If it works *the exact same way* except privately it's still a Blockchain. What you're trying to do is basically say a car is no longer a car when you park it in a garage or drive it on a private road. 
If denial is all you got you're in for a harsh reality check, because private Blockchain are here and here to stay. Google "Linq" - NASDAQ has been operating a private chain for institutional clients for months that operates exactly like Bitcoin does but only for subscribers. You can go ahead and childishly deny that it's a Blockchain but you have no credibility and your claims are meaningless, just juvenile denial. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 10:37:54


Daily transaction volume is ~300,000 coins. The block reward is only getting reduced by 1800 coins. Downward pressure will be about 1% less, not 50%. Your math is way, way off and for some reason people think the block reward is the only source of supply. It isn't. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 15:00:08
You're making some ridiculous presumptions there. For one sentence you were reasonable and then went into several ridiculous assumptions about the teams working on these projects.

Your comment is funny for sooooo many reasons


No, they haven't


Remember when Bitcoin was going to end legacy banking? Remember when it was a financial revolution? Gosh now we're all so thankful banks are experimenting with the technology
But wait, they aren't using Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is centralized to chinese miners and developed by a bunch of children who endlessly debate over meager updates and stuck under 10 transactions per second
The fact that banks are using private blockchains means nothing for Bitcoin, it certainly doesn't mean Bitcoin has a bright future or that they're interested in buying Bitcoins. Probably worst of all, you're using the good-old Appeal to Authority argument - while referencing banks as the authority - as proof of Bitcoin's success. The same banks Bitcoin was supposed to usurp - who aren't using Bitcoin - are somehow proof that all arguments against Bitcoin are refuted? Seems to me like them using the underlying technology but not Bitcoin itself speaks more about bitcoin's inadequacies than it's qualities. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 11:05:51
You hoping Bitcoin can just run on the block reward charity forever?
By 2035 the block reward will be 99.5% expired. Even if the price does keep doubling and doubling before then it will still be dependent on transaction fees by that point if not earlier
@_date: 2016-04-14 00:34:17
Bitcoin is a push-based payment system - one of the main "features" of Bitcoin payments versus credit cards was that nobody can pull money from your account. 
That said, Bitcoin was not made for subscription payment systems. You'd have to get people to prepay for several months or only pay one month at a time manually, which are obviously not true subscription payments. 
Indeed, every fiat/BTC interface has to play by the same fiat banking regulations. You aren't going to find an unlimited anonymous BTC provider because that would be absolutely heaven for a money laundering operation. 
In addition to that, you seem to want customers to remit payment in fiat and ultimately receive BTC. With all the above caveats, why not just accept credit cards and buy BTC yourself with the revenue?  You aren't going to be accepting anonymous payments in bulk anyway so you may as well enjoy the massive userbase of credit card holders. People are unlikely to sign up for Coinbase or buy Bitcoin just to use your service 
@_date: 2016-04-08 03:24:02


It's only "instant' because everything has been prepaid. It's like if two people are in a room and both put $10 on a table. Then, without touching the money, they both pretend to trade pennies back and forth a hundred thousand times. After all these trades are done they settle out of the $20. The transactions *are* "instant", but only because money was locked up in the first place


See above example. There are no minimums because nothing is actually being exchanged until settlement has occurred. 


No, existing fiat systems don't require users to lock up funds beforehand. Visa can handle 56,000 tps without needing a customer to prepay a single dollar. 


With some hilariously low assumptions about people only opening or closing a channel once a month. 
Lightning is a fantasy solution, everything mentioned above is a "best case scenario" where people are willing to lock up weeks or months worth of spending in advance simply to use Bitcoin - there has been no indication that retailers are interested in participating in these channels
The amount of hope and faith people are putting in Lightning operating perfectly and solving all of Bitcoin's problems is downright dangerous. Bitcoin has very little usership to date and there's essentially no indication that future users are interested in locking up funds to use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 01:27:09
The tokens are to secure a public blockchain, if they had no value there would be no incentive to keep things honest. 
With private blockchains, the token is irrelevant. You only mine on a private blockchain by being given permission to do so, and any malicious actions will revoke your permissions. If you're an institutional client you don't want to lose your status. 
Private chains don't need enormous computer power, because there's no difficulty and no competition. 
"Efficiency" is where you lost me. Bitcoin is *massively* inefficient and by recent estimates uses as much electricity as *All of Ireland* just to process 3 transactions per second MAX. 
If you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer them. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 21:50:14
Not every blockchain needs a native currency,  nor do the "coins" need a public value. You're just showing how closed-minded and biased you are by decrying every blockchain except Bitcoin as a "shitcoin" - very juvenile. It's a technology, Bitcoin was the first but certainly isn't the last and may not be the best. If another blockchain can satisfy institutional needs better than Bitcoin than so be it, childish names aren't going to stop that. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 02:55:16
Of course they do, but not when their permission to access the private chain is at stake. 
If one business acts maliciously, the changes are simply rolled back and they are shunned from the chain and all the benefits attached. This is incentive enough to keep participants honest, because any problems they cause will be a temporary problem and a permanent revocation for them. 
Do you think NASDAQs institutional clients are going to do something to risk their membership? Of course not. Your statement is just hyperbole and I understand that, but really these business want to maintain their status in the chain and in many cases are paying subscription fees for access to it.

The problem there is that the biggest and most popular merchants (like Expedia and Dell) don't accept BTC at all, they allow people to sell their BTC for fiat via Bitpay or Coinbase and they receive fiat only. If they're unwilling to accept BTC nos, why would they involve themselves in a system that only works with BTC? They won't. 
Sorry but Joe's Tiny Bitcoin Soap Store is irrelevant to this conversation. The big merchants that matter and attract people go Bitcoin don't actually hold or use Bitcoin and so they absolutely won't be involved with LN. 
Go on and pay your Dish bill or order a Dell computer with Bitcoin but instead of using an intermediary demand their Bitcoin address to pay directly - they don't have one because they don't want your Bitcoin.

More volume in illegal darknet markets than Bitpay processed.

This is incredibly naive. NASDAQ has been operating a private Blockchain for institutional subscribers since October. Intel and IBM are both developing the technology - you think they don't know what they are building?  There's no rules that say if you're using Blockchain privately or ones that aren't called Bitcoin that it's no longer a Blockchain. That's like saying your car is something else when you drive it on a course or park it in a garage. It's a technology that works whether it's Bitcoin or litecoin or a private chain like Linq.

@_date: 2016-04-06 03:36:13


And obviously you never will, therefore these costs are $0 right? 


Who's bashing? You said there was "absolutely $0" costs involved in operating OB, you're already backpedalling and you don't offer refunds...do you expect that's a good option for consumers? Most merchants who "accept" BTC nowadays only do so because they recieve payment ultimately in fiat...so you're describing in one fell swoop why both typical customers would avoid your store (no refunds) and why merchants would avoid OB (no fiat payments)


Of course, because if you have issue with anything in the Bitcoin world you must be a paid troll or corporate shill, right? 
The bottom line is you don't have to work for EBay to see that OB isn't much in the way of competition, doesn't cist $0 to operate, isn't consumer friendly (no refunds!) 
@_date: 2016-04-16 01:26:11
Yes better than Bitcoins being created out of thin air, and also offering no rewards or the ability to chargeback...
This shift card is nothing but a debit card, something people have been using for decades. You buy Bitcoins with fiat and then use a service to sell them for fiat to use on a debit card. It's the exact same thing people already use but with extra steps. It isn't using Bitcoins, it's selling them.

Why are you denominating both currencies with the symbol of another currency?  Try your example again with a specific number of Euros of Bitcoins and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. You can't own $10,000 in Bitcoin because "$" denotes USD. You can own $10,000 USD worth of Bitcoin or $10,000 USD worth of Euro, but see what happens to the volatility of both?  Again, it's downright idiotic to claim a $20 drop in Bitcoins price is the same as the Euro or USD dropping a penny
Let's put it this way : When Bitcoin drops 5%, how much has it dropped on Euros or in USD? Do you see the difference between that and the difference in USD terms when the Euro drops 5% ?
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:46:22
No, it isn't. When you put them into percentages it may seem so but on a dollar basis Bitcoin is far, far more volatile. 
This same argument came up on bitcoinmarkets recently, claiming that Bitcoin was less volatile than the Euro because Bitcoin had moved less than 5%, but the actual dollar comparison was a $20 swing versus 1/10th of one cent. 
If Bitcoins were $1M each would you say a 1% swing in bitcoin's price is less volatile than a 2% swing in the USD? One is moving $10,000, the other is moving a couple of cents. Percentages can be deceiving but they are a ridiculous way to compare the volatility of two currencies. If bitcoin were actually less volatile than any of the aforementioned, including gold, the comparison would be made for the actual USD difference and not a percentage of the whole. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 18:43:33
Exactly this. Every discussion I've seen about how LN operates is an absolute "best case scenario" with no thought put towards logistics or incentives for use. 
If starbucks doesn't want to accept Bitcoin today, why would they want to operate a Lightning channel? if people already don't want to or need to use Bitcoin, why would they be interested in tying up finds? 
All this talk of "no fees" and "instant transactions" is laughable when you consider all the money is required up front. Use of LN is not unlike expecting people to simply buy gift cards for everything they need and, worryingly, promises to remove transaction fees from miners pockets when the current implementation of Bitcoin is supposed to be easing everybody into a solely fee-based system. 
I don't see any logical, rational reason why new companies or new consumers will be interested in participating in Lightning. Bitcoin itself failed to steal them away from legacy banking and now Bitcoin has admittedly failed to scale...so another more convoluted and confusing system is going to do the job? I don't think so

You think merchants value their own time at $0? Honest question. 
Does OB run itself, deal with customers, handle returns, troubleshoot, etc, all for free and automatically? Of course it does not. To say that it costs nothing to get established and operate on OB shows an insane naivete to the actual costs of running a business. 
Setting up OB takes time. Listing your items takes time. Dealing with returns takes time. If the value of Bitcoin changed since your return you've got yet another issue to deal with. If there's an issue with OB and you have to troubleshoot that takes time. Are you really that naive to the actual time and effort involved in operating the simplest of businesses? It absolutely does not cost $0 to operate a store on OB, unless you consider your own time worthless
@_date: 2016-04-14 04:16:01


First, if they aren't accepting Bitcoin then how can you claim they are receiving any benefits from it? The only thing they are receiving is the USD value of it. 
Second, LN is not like using a Bitcoin-fiat conversion like they are now - LN is nothing but a system to transfer Bitcoins. It has nothing to do with converting to fiat, so there's no way retailers are going to be involved with LN unless they intend on keeping some BTC or doing transactions in BTC. What you might be suggesting is that Coinbase or BitPay or whatever provider they use now will maintain an LN channel for them, but again that retailer wouldn't really be involved with LN in any way

Right, but as a buyer there's no incentive to use OB. It's a more complicated form of the same commerce they enjoy today without having to learn to use OB or shop on an unfamiliar and untrustworthy site. All the benefits are merchant-sides with a lack of incentives to compensate consumers for the hassle. Early stage or not shoppers are unlikely to buy bitcoins, learn to use them and learn to use OB just to save a percent or two. 
In theory it's a wonderful idea but in practice it's like asking shoppers to drive to the mall across town and across an off-road course just to save a few bucks - consumers are happy to pay for convenience and would rather spend a bit more than inconvenience themselves. 
If it's unattractive in the short term there's no real reason that's going to change over time.

Because Bitcoins value is volatile, you can make more interest with other investments, and you just plain can't expect people to invest more than they want to spend on a large scale. You're a devotee, a complete Bitcoin fanatic and you would do literally anything it takes to keep using Bitcoin at this point but for the millions upon millions of people already using traditional banking what you're suggesting sounds totally ludicrous. It's a pie-in-the-sky fantasy where every user is willin to tie up a years worth of coffee and grocery money to keep using Bitcoin - it's simply not realistic. Starbucks won't be opening a Lightning channel with their bean vendors and their customers just for the few Bitcoin sales they see and just to cover the shortcomings of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Fees are not a fixed 2.9% - they vary based on business type and volume. Amazon pays ~1%, many other large retailers only pay 1.15-1.5%
Credit card fees are relatively tiny, especially considering the incredible volume of sales they enable.

Sarcastic answer: obviously none, that's why they've invested in it, spent man hours developing and maintaining it and signed institutional subscribers to use it. What fools! Don't they know Bitcoin is the only blockchain that matters! 
Official answer:








Simplified answer:
Literally all the advantages Bitcoin offers with none of the downsides hampering Bitcoin. Blockchains don't need to be public, don't need a publicly traded token, don't need to be publicly mined and don't need to be transparent. The only benefit Bitcoin affords over private chains is trustlessness, but when parties are willing to trust each other (or have membership revoked to their detriment for malicious actions) a private blockchain is far superior to their need than a public one.

Right, and as I said, it may not be efficient scaling or useful scaling but 6 tps is still double the current on-chain capacity. You can't argue that raisin the block size isn't on-chain scaling.


Literally 100% more transactions than Bitcoin is capable of today. Take every current use case and double it. Bitcoin doesn't easily scale but some small gains are easy to achieve, one of them being a meager block size bump.

You can't. You can send a max 3 tps, and the fee is only so low because so few people use Bitcoin and the block reward subsidizes transaction costs. When blocks fill up fees rise or you get plain locked out. You're talking about driving on a mostly empty highway and trying to claim traffic will never be s problem. If mainstream adoption actually occurred your ten cent transactions would very quickly be priced out and the entire world would be fighting for those 3 tps. 


Locking up funds on LN is selling. You've locked up that money and if the price changes you have to close that channel to cash out. How you're trying to argue volatility is irrelevant in a prepay system is beyond me and totally idiotic. You can't blindly claim volatility isn't an issue on the idiotic assumption at nobody will want to cash out for several years. Do you really think that's realistic?


So you think businesses will accept BTC for payment and then hold it indefinitely ? That's not at all how it's been going so far so why would you assume that about the future?
I'm sorry but those slides are irrelevant. It's fantasy with unrealistic optimism. Considering you think you can send unlimited ten cent transactions forever I'm not sure you totally understand he economics behind Bitcoin or are even capable of understanding the severe limitations of the LN. You just want to wave your hands and pretend everything is working out perfectly


Oh the multiple-thousand transaction backlog that caused dozens and dozens of complaint threads about six and eight hour confirmations is over, I guess there's no problem ! As long as they aren't full *right now* we can forget the entire network is limited to 1MB

Neither document explains why Africans would buy bitcoins, experience volatility and then spend them just to do the same commerce they can do today without the volatility. Again, you have no clue what you're talking about. You haven't made a single cogent argument because you're incapable, all you can do is offer random irrelevant links and pretend you actually made a point. Pretty pathetic.

You're incredibly naive to not recognize the issue here. Six cents is obviously a very low fee...but Bitcoin has very few users. Its not six cents forever, it isn't six cents if you want a quick confirmation when there is a backlog and it won't be six cents if millions of people were actively competing for block space
As adoption grows the transaction fees will only keep rising or confirmation times will grow. It doesn't scale with 6 cent fees and that's the problem some of us can recognize while others make sarcastic comments. Fees have already risen high enough to prohibit micro transactions on chain and adoption hasn't even started (and may never).

This is a concerning evaluation of the demand for space on the Bitcoin blockchain - any spike in actual demand for Bitcoin use that Bitcoin evangelists have been clamoring for since 2009 is called unwanted spam, "manipulation" and hopefully a "one-off event" because a backlog this bad making the network either cheap or quick but not both at such an early stage is enormously unattractive at such a competitive time in the payment space.

The system Bitcoin runs on is called a blockchain, not a Bitcoin, not Bitcoin. 


And yet you provide little evidence of this. The fact is there are many ways to use blockchains more effectively than the 1MB, 10-minute Bitcoin blockchain. You can't jump between calling Bitcoin low-level and a settlement layer for everything underneath it. NASDAQ operates their own private Linq blockchain because Bitcoin's capacity was woefully insufficient, that's a very clear example of a blockchain (not a Bitcoin) being used more effectively than Bitcoin - a purpose-built blockchain, totally customized for its use. 
Until more efficient methods exist you don't need to keep talking about imaginary better ways of using Bitcoin, and you sound plain wrong calling the system Bitcoin operates on "Bitcoin" and not the proper "blockchain". It's obvious you're intentionally trying to portray Bitcoin as the only blockchain that will ever be relevant or useful as this is not the case.

This applies to most of your points but for brevity I'll focus on one
How do you know the cleaning was done? How do you know it was done well enough? The problem with these smart contracts is that most transactions require human intervention to confirm quality and completion of a task. My 21.co smart house could pay a contractor to renovate itself too but who knows if the work was done properly? It's a lot easier to claim your car can pay for gas and charge itself than to ponder the actual mechanics of it. 
Beyond that, imagine how many transactions you're talking about. With mass adoption that's more than even LN can handle and that's not including human transactions. 
I just don't see these smart contract transactions as feasible. People love to talk about how Bitcoin can eliminate courts and lawyers and banks but they're necessary entities when things inevitably go wrong, otherwise you come to your maggot-filled summer house and realize you didn't have a way to check if things were actually being done. Physical services aren't computer code you can execute upon completion and human involvement means there's always potential for dishonesty

Bitcoin confirmations take at least ten minutes and fees are only so cheap because a) the costs are subsidized by the block reward and b) practically nobody uses it.

Banks are insured with the FDIC up to $250,000 per savings account.

It's beyond me why you thought that rambling nonsense was relevant. Bitcoin clearly isn't a well-designed city and traffic does occur regardless of how well designed a city is. 
The fact of the matter is LN only works on the hopes and dreams that everybody using it only uses it an absolutely minimal amount - theres absolutely no basis for this assumption. 
By the way, have you been to New York? Have you *seen* the traffic ? You can't drive anywhere quickly because the streets are so fucking clogged because everybody wants to drive - the exact reason LN won't do shit. You're simply hand-waving away realistic concerns with totally unrealistic solutions. LN only works well if practically nobody uses it, just like Bitcoin and just like the highways. Your rambling misplaced analogy is beyond irrelevant in the reality of commerce, but nice try. 
Want another analogy? The streets of New York wouldn't be so busy if everybody only goes outside once a month. The busses of New York wouldn't be so busy if you only rode them once a year. It doesn't matter how you change it, the fact is Lighning only works for hundreds of millions of users if only dozens of them actually use the network on a daily basis - it's still hampered by the underlying Blockchain

No. They're reliant on the main Bitcoin blockchain. Their business plan is trying to kickstart the "internet of things" by placing small mining devices inside appliances or devices so those devices earn their own small amount of bitcoins which can in turn be spent to communicate with other "internet of things" devices
The big glaring problems with these plans:
The devices mine at a loss, they use more electricity then they earn in Bitcoins so it always makes more sense to just buy bitcoins with the money you'd use to buy the device
Worse than this, aside from mining at a loss you're mining in 21s pool, so they are using your electricity to earn bitcoins for themselves. 
Finally, devices don't need bitcoins to communicate with each other, fridges and televisions have been internet-capable for years now and you don't need satoshis to have them communicate. Granted the idea is that your appliances will earn their own communicative tokens but I've seen little evidence of demand for this

 &gt;You cannot have a blockchain without an incentive structure to promote good behavior, ie a valuable token.
Wrong. NASDAQ operates a private blockchain called Linq strictly for institutional users. The tokens used on their chain have no individual or public value but merely represent a transaction taking place. Participants of Linq risk losing transaction privileges with malicious behavior, and that is incentive enough. Should malicious activities occur any problems would be rolled back and the malicious actor would have their permissions revoked. This is how a private chain works without publicly valuable tokens
@_date: 2016-03-16 21:48:13
I meant the analogy as a more inconvenient mall than the one around the corner. OB is the mall in another town you can only access by unicycle and that only accepts Magic cards. Maybe the goods are a dollar cheaper but it's a hassle to shop there and a hassle just to use the only currency they accept. Saving that dollar is not enough to be worth the drive. 
This goes to a larger point - OBs real basis is that merchants, once they aren't paying CC fees, might pass those savings on to consumers but this ignores the root of why they are accepting CCs in the first place - consumer convenience. If they cared about instant settlement they would only accept cash but credit cards allow millions of shoppers worldwide to patronize their store. It's for the benefit of consumers, not merchants. Expecting this paradigm to change to one where consumers are inconveniencing themselves to save the merchant money is not realistic. 
In most cases you need a credit card or bank account to buy Bitcoins, so if they already have the means to shop and the price difference is negligible why would they add another complicated step to their shopping routine? They won't. Not in the short term and not in the long term because the incentive simply isn't there.

This shouldn't be difficult to believe. It makes no sense to spend Bitcoins at retail when the price will go up, it makes no sense to use Bitcoins for shopping when evrubody already has a credit card and it makes no sense to use Bitcoins for remittance when the recipient still has to convert the funds
The only clear and obvious use case for Bitcoins is anonymous online purchase and pretty much the only thing you need to buy anonymously is drugs.

Yes, they do. I would assume, at the very least, your Tariff Ttpe would change based on the massive additional usage which would nullify the plan. Honestly, you obviously aren't versed in legalese and just thought you discovered this One Weird Trick for Free Electricitt




You're a fool if you don't think their terms have been vetted by a team of lawyers to make sure they aren't taken advantage of. Do you really think it could be so easy as "use barely any electricity for 3 months and then I get unlimited energy all year"? 
The plan is to take a 3-month average of your bills and then charge you that. If you substantially change your energy usage afterwards you're no longer operating in good faith and have substantially increased your average, which would immediately cause them to reassess your use.

It's been seven years. Bitcoin services are just trying to emulate fiat services...but with Bitcoin. There's no incentive for people to abandon fiat. We are absolutely past the R&amp;D stage - there are Bitcoin debit cards, Bitcoin banks, Bitcoin exchanges and still no reason for people to buy and hold Bitcoin. 


I don't know if you noticed but VC funding for Bitcoin companies fell off a cliff several quarters ago. I can dig up links if you like or you can google them yourself. 


Aside from the fact that VCs realized months ago Bitcoin wasn't worth the risk, this is an irrelevant point. Just because an investment is risky doesn't mean it is good. It doesn't matter how much time you give it, Bitcoin remains an inferior option. This isn't premature because Bitcoin is working as intended. It's never going to offer charge backs or have a perfectly stable value without the third parties it was created to avoid, third parties like Visa and PayPal that people are already familiar with. At the root of this you're asking that people wait five or ten years for Bitcoin to reinvent the wheel and then for people to switch over to a system comparable to one they already use for no significant benefit. Consumerism and economics are about incentives and the only incentive to use Bitcoin for commerce is if you're buying illegal drugs or support Libertarian ideals of what money is supposed to be - a fringe group that will never make a significant dent in traditional economies. 
It's 2016. People love to draw the comparison between Bitcoin and the early internet because it gives them an excuse for slow adoption, but in today's world people are technologically savvy and can easily recognize the value in new technology and services. Uber, PayPal, Etsy, Instagram, Square, and countless other services have hundreds of millions of users within a few years because it's easy for people to recognize the convenience and incentives for use, but Bitcoin is simply trying to offer similar but more complicated services than are already available and it just doesn't make sense for people to bother switching to an EBay with Bitcoins when they don't need Bitcoins to use EBay and they can just chargeback a non-received item rather than deal with some OB moderator who may or may not be working with the vendor and also wonder what happened to the value of Bitcoin in the meantime 
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:45:05
The reason transfers are relatively quick and fees are low is precisely because the userbase is small, can't you see that ? When adoption occurs blocks fill up and Bitcoin is neither fast nor cheap. We've already seen this begin on a small scale with the tiny amount of adoption Bitcoin already has 
@_date: 2016-03-22 03:49:07
Where did you get the idea that a blockchain must be public ? Who made that rule? 
You're in denial. Hashchains don't really describe what Linq is. Private chains operate the exact same way as public chains and it doesn't lose status as a blockchain simply because it only allows registered entities to participate. By your idiotic definition a car is no longer a car when it drives on a private road because... Uhh...well because I don't like your car!
You're an idiot. I'm not angry with you, I feel bad for you. You're obviously being willfully ignorant here because you want Bitcoin to be the only blockchain even though many others exist, both private and public, POW and otherwise.

Nothing but financial incentive binds them. They have investments in equipment that only work for mining Bitcoins and are obsoleted fairly quickly without continued reinvestment. If an altcoin was more globally accepted and profitable to mine than Bitcoins they would instantly hop over - this isn't a charity operation and they likely have no sentimental attachment to keep the bitcoin network operating at massive losses
What's troubling is almost the entire miner revenue currently comes from the block reward they're all competing for. The transition from mining for the block reward to solely receiving fees is going to be fascinating. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 03:23:07
You asked for the benefits, I highlighted them for you. As a Bitcoin owner you have a strong bias to claim private blockchains are useless but obviously the institutions subscribed to Linq are seeing the many benefits I noted. A private blockchain is simply better than a private database, the people at Nasdaq and the users of Linq know what they are doing much more than you or I, friend.

What other payment method requires you to convert it again before you can spend it at 99.99% of local stores?  Only Bitcoin. What other payment method is limited to 3 transactions per second?  Only Bitcoin. 
You're not comparing apples to apples when you compare Bitcoin and fiat. Sending someone Bitcoins isn't the same as spending them easily usable money, which is why it has been a total failure for remittances and why retailers won't accept it without a middleman to convert for them
If bitcoin was being used as a worldwide payment mechanism, like fiat, with millions of transactions per second you could pay  tens of dollars per transaction to fit into the next tiny block. Nobody is using it so fees are low but they won't remain low forever, unless adoption never occurs.

Right..."pretty much". 


Imagination is nice in that it's not constrained to reality. Again, nobody knows how many TPS Lightning can actually achieve because it's still technically limited to the throughput of the Bitcoin network to handle the channels. The kind of commerce you're talking about would require some enormous blocks on the main blockchain. You're talking about how confident you are that Lightning can handle the equivalent of 100MB block transaction capacity while Bitcoin sits at 1MB. 


Replace Lightning with Bitcoin and this is exactly what people used to say about Bitcoin - now the goalposts have been moved to Lightning. Maybe when Lightning can't handle the thousands and thousands of TPS you're talking about some new network will be created as a third layer to lay all our faith in

Citation needed. 
You're talking definitively about something that doesn't exist - LN is not proven to scale for worldwide usage and is still dependent on the underlying blockchain. Everybody that talks about LN as a scaling solution is making ridiculous presumptions about absolutely minimal use, a sort of best-case-scenario of people only opening and closing a channel once a month or once a year when this isn't necessarily how it will work. Working with Bitcoin is already cumbersome, now we're asking people to tie up funds in some new convoluted system to cover its shortcomings ? I can see people abandoning the system altogether rather than use a complicated system inside dependent on and inside of another complicated system. 
If people don't use LN in an absolutely minimal fashion then it won't work at all they way you hope it does and won't result in any increased adoption.

Nasdaq operates a private blockchain called Linq they use for high-frequency trading among institutional clients. Being a private chain they haven't released specific tps figures but considering its use exclusively for HFT chances are it is one of the most capable chains.

"Bitcoin" (the system) is called a *blockchain*, not Bitcoin. Bitcoins are both a unit of account for and the name of one particular blockchain, but Bitcoin isn't the name of the system that Bitcoins run on. 
Now, ironically, there are plenty of ways to use blockchains more effectively than using the Bitcoin blockchain, because the Bitcoin blockchain is weighed down by the indecisions of its developers. The future (and the present, actually) hold other blockchains more suited to handling daily large volumes the Bitcoin blockchain will never be capable of. 
Why use Bitcoin + some other shit bolted on when people can use something else with no LN hub nonsense to deal with or better yet just stick with legacy banking?

I'm not keen on doing your homework for you, but I'll help a little bit


Where did you get the impression you aren't supposed to be able to trace bitcoin transactions? The whole idea behind Bitcoin is a blockchain ledger of every single transaction in plain sight. If you can tie a person to an address then you know how much money they've sent and perhaps also who it was sent to. 
Ross Ulbricht was recently sentenced to prison for his operation of a Bitcoin-based online darknet drug market, part of the evidence of which included Bitcoin transaction trees
In fact, many of the largest bitcoin thefts to date are essentially viewable to the public, but it is not known who has ownership of the destination addresses. There's a list of some of the largest thefts to date over on Bitcointalk


This isn't the kind of thing they'd usually want reported, but something you could mention are the recent Bitcoin "ransomware" attacks wherein computer files are encrypted and an anonymous Bitcoin payment is necessary to unlock files. Recently an entire hospital's database was held ransom by one of these attacks. It isn't clear who's behind these or who controls the money, which is in the millions now. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 01:03:35
You can't confidently state that the Lightning network can handle *X*. It doesn't exist yet and until it does and has been tested nobody can say for sure what LN can handle. I'm not saying it won't be able to but its not especially safe to pin your hopes on an untested and unproven solution. It wasn't too long about people talked about how Bitcoin could for sure scale to Visa levels, now we talk about how LN will do the work...but can it?  Will businesses be interested in tying up funds in a channel?

That is why. Darknet drug transactions made up more Bitcoin volume last year than the top payment processor, Bitpay. 
There's no need to be defensive about it, the only clear and superior use-case Bitcoin has today is buying drugs online. For every other type of transaction (remittances, retail shopping) people already have convenient and familiar options so it only makes sense that when people are buying Bitcoin there's a fair likelihood its for drugs. 
Browse r/darknetmarkets for yourself. There's a lot more activity there of people spending Bitcoins than in this sibreddit, and a lot of advice about buying and tumbling Bitcoins. 
Again, this isn't FUD or an attempt to discredit Bitcoins - they really are a useful tool for buying drugs anonymously online and less useful for most other types of use.

Sending bitcoins to China doesn't do a lot of good when you can't spend it anywhere. Sending bitcoins is not the same as a remittance. 
Again, I'll remind you, the network you adore so much is only cheap and fast because no one uses it. The more adoption occurs the more expensive and slow your transactions become. 
By the way here in Canada I can instantly wire anybody up to $6000 for $1.50 flat fee. No buying BTC or worrying about confirmations. When Bitcoin blocks fill up you either spend more or wait longer but the system bogs down no matter what. The system you call cheap is subsidized by the block reward and if the block reward didn't exist (it won't for much longer) transactions would be $5. If millions of people actually used Bitcoin regularly you might be waiting days for a confirmation. 
Again, you're bragging about how cheap and fast a system that nobody uses is, a system that gets slower and more expensive the more that people use it.

@_date: 2016-03-13 16:40:10
That's not necessarily true, it's one of those things about public blockchains like Bitcoin but private chains can be customized for any throughput or block size. The things dragging Bitcoin down are the need for consensus among a wide range of interests and not a centralized entity just saying "okay let's do 100MB blocks we can handle it" without concern for China. 
Honestly, as far as I can tell the main thing holding Bitcoin back is that mining has been taken over by the Chinese and now any changes have to see their approval 
@_date: 2016-03-20 05:08:12
It works because Bitcoins transactions are irreversible. You send Bitcoins to an exchange and that exchange gets "hacked" or disappears and your money is gone. You send Bitcoin to somebody to buy something and they never send the item, you have no way to retrieve your money. Your computers gets compromised, somebody sends your bitcoins to themselves and you have no way of reversing that.
Once they are out of your hands they are gone forever. You don't need access to a wallet, you just need access to a computer or to trick somebody into sending you bitcoins without sending them anything in return. 


Because hundreds if not thousands of Bitcoin users have irreversibly lost their Bitcoins. With traditional banking you can chargeback on your credit card or have your bank revoke a wire - with Bitcoin you are SOL.

A few qualms :


Bitcoin is neither decentralized nor unassailable by any government. Miners in China own this currency, that's a fact and the centralization of mining will only get worse, that's just how the economics of mining was always going to work. 


This is unrealistic. You can't make a profit on a Bitcoi without selling it to someone else down the line for more than you paid for. The line of Greater Fools is not never ending. Bitcoins value doesn't grow out of thin air. 


Again, unrealistic. Bitcoin, even with LN, can't handle a significant amount of person to person commerce, allowing machines to make micro transactions is just going to further clog the network. 


Simply untrue, the fault with Bitcoin is that decentralization (or at least an attempt at it) is crucial. A centralized entity can easily create a network to service everybody because they have no concerns for whether or not Chinese Bitcoin miners have the bandwidth for growth. Visas single layer handles 56,000 tps. 


Keep telling yoursel this. What's actually happening is he goalposts are moving, from Bitcoin will take over finance! to LN will handle the scale to -new layer- can scale Bitcoin !
It's naive to ignore that this has been the case. Bitcoin can't scale, LN is bolted on to Bitcoin and can't scale and soon enough some new fantasy solution will arise on top of LN to offer a new false hope of Bitcoin world domination


And all of those layers are still limited by the initial network, adding only another layer of confusion and convolution. 


No. It's just too far-fetched, you're stretching your imagination here to fit your financial and emotional investments. Bitcoin doesn't scale and LN won't really help. You're just pinning your hopes on moving goalposts. 


It certainly does not. You're reliant on miners in China processing your transaction and a third-party wallet to store your coins. Bitcoin is not censorship-resistant. You can hardly use it without an intermediary and indeed most Bitcoin users are reliant on intermediaries, likely yourself included. You can't spend Bitcoins at most retailers because they won't accept them without an intermediary to convert to fiat and that's a genie that's not going back in the bottle


This is some pie-in-the-sky dreaming, friend. LN doesn't exist. This capability isn't proven. Remember when Bitcoin offered instant fraud proof confirmations ? Oh look there go those goalposts moving. If Bitcoin fell so far short of expectations why are you so confident LN will work so flawlessly?

What ? Blocks aren't full? People wanting to use the blockchain aren't being called spammers ? What Bitcoin are you talking about?


First of all, I never said anything about five years. 
Second, I've read the LN white paper and assumptions about users only being able to open or close 2 channels per year
Finally, LN is limited by Bitcoin proper so on day one everyone is still restricted to however many transactions fit into a Bitcoin block. 


None of this has anything to do with volatility. Good job!


That's not the question, the question is how many times do you go to the grocery store and pay for your entire years worth of food? How often do you go to Starbucks and pay for your months worth of coffee? People aren't particularly interested in prepaying for a commodity they buy regularly and especially so when the payment vehicle changes wildly in value. You lock up $100 in BTC for coffee and maybe you've lost $10 to volatility before you can spend it. Do I really need to explain why this won't catch on for mainstream use ?


No, you're not sure, because you can't be sure of something like that. You *hope*. Seeing how few coffee shops accept Bitcoin already I don't see why they'd go through the additional hassle of locking up funds with vendors just to make use of LN. 


Considering you replied with completely off-topic nonsense earlier when I mentioned volatility and then totally ignored it here I have to ask - do you even know what volatility means ? Because the bitcoin these companies lock up to use LN changing in value represents a risk. You sure type a lot of words for someone that makes no sense and can't present a rational argument 


Tell me, are you ignorant or just disingenuous ? CNY volume for the last 30 days was over 100M coins.

The very title of the article denies the Silk Road comparison and likens it to a new eBay, so I strongly disagree with your assertion. I don't know how you can claim the article focuses on drugs or claims OB intends to be Silk Road when it starts with "OB is Not the next Silk Road"
As an aside, you may call them exorbitant but EBay provides a reputable, convenient and extremely popular centralized location to sell goods that requires no effort for consumers. PayPal offers a similarly convenient service. When combined this enables a simple online merchant to sell to tens if not hundreds of millions of people around the world...for a fee. The Cost of Doing Business. If you don't want to pay it your competitors happily will and they will eat your lunch as a result. This is the very root of why retailers accept credit cards in the first place, even with all the Bitcoin rhetoric about high fees and charge backs. 
Now, with OB, you might not have a fee but you also don't have any customers looking at your goods and an infinitely smaller base of potential customers based on the Bitcoin-only payments. When you compare the two, the "exorbitant fees" are the cost of enormous opportunity that doesn't exist with OB. You save yourself 3% or 5% or even 20% in fees but lose 99.99999% of prospective customers and suddenly the fees don't seem so exorbitant. 
Put simply, I'd rather pay EBay and PayPal the fees they ask and have thousands of sales than make one or two no fee sales per month. It doesn't take a genius to realize those fees are easily worth the customer base that accompanies them. Nobody is going to jump through the hoops of using OB and Bitcoin to save a few dollars except those who already own Bitcoin.

You dont live "full on BTC", you use third parties to sell BTC for that "goat shit" that everybody accepts and pretend you've used BTC. BTC was created to avoid middlemen but you probably use one every day

Better to pay a fee and have your product in the eyes of millions of customers than set up shop in a ghost town. A retailer paying Ebays highest fees will still see more profit than any vendor on OB considering you'll make more from 100 sales than 1 even with higher fees. 
Eliminating the cut of the middleman is only beneficial if you don't sacrifice a gigantic customer base in exchange

Segwit and the 2-8MB blocks being discussed for the near future are a pretty insignificant bump in transaction capacity in the big picture, though. We're talking about going from 7tps to maybe 35-40tps? That's a nice gain but still tremendously low for a top-level global payment network, even if just for settlements and lightning channels.

And yet NASDAQ has been operating their own Linq blockchain for High Frequency Trading without issue for months now. 
Private blockchains have their own purposes, the only people disagreeing have personal financial investments in the Bitcoin blockchain. If that's not a bias I don't know what is.

No, I'm bemoaning that there's no incentive for consumers to use it compared to familiar and trusted existing commerce sites. You can say it takes time to grow a base but if there no incentive to shop there and it's more cumbersome than the methods people are already familiar with adoption will simply never happen. 
Compared to shopping on EBay using the consumer protections of a credit card OB does suck balls. It's relatively complicated and the only benefits are for the merchant. Merchants serve customers and not the other way around. 
It just simply doesn't make sense for people to deal with learning to use a Bitcoins, buying Bitcoins, learning to use OB, giving up the guaranteed protections of their card all to potentially save a negligible amount of money, or maybe nothing at all for the sole benefit of the merchant. The inconvenience outweighs the negligible benefit, that's why the customer base will never develop outside of the totally insignificant number of "pioneers" devoted enough to Bitcoin to kid themselves this will be popular. If you're already emotionally and financially invested in Bitcoin it's easy to blind yourself to the truth of how strange and inconvenient OB is compared to what people are used to.

Microsoft never accepted Bitcoins in the first place, they only used it as a means of getting more USD and only accepted it because another company could convert BTC sales to USD. If Bitpay didn't exist they never would have started accepting because they have no interest in receiving Bitcoins or holding Bitcoins

But prioritizing transactions means they have to find blocks...which they haven't been. They don't have the hash power and didn't sell enough Bitcoin computers to gain the hash power they needed.

If we're forgoing the micro transaction aspect until some "settlement" when a larger amount is deducted then how is that any better than paying in advance for 100 pages or whatever?  It doesn't seem like the model you're proposing is using any of the benefits of Bitcoin anyway, the whole idea was not to wait for "payment thresholds" but to be able to pay for only one page on demand or even pay your employees every hour

That's all hypothetical, and all based on the ridiculous assumption that users are only going to need to open or close a handful of channels per year. Needless to say, theories about the most optimal LN use don't mean that LN will work under actual real-world conditions. As I mentioned before there's no proof that anybody is willing to tie up funds on LN or that companies are going to want to connect channels or use LN at all 
Like, I asked for a citation that LN would work under suboptimal channel use and you just posted some vague slides about how it can handle millions if not billions of transactions based on optimal use and everybody connecting channel, something that absolutely may not occur

You didn't answer my question at all. You can't send Bitcoin with SMS you need an active internet connection for any kind of transaction to actually take place. Nice try though.

I'm not sure why you're making that assumption when I never said we go from 2MB blocks to 8GB blocks but level with me here, if a blockchain is supposed to serve the entire world it makes sense to me that the blocks would be pretty large. It kind of saddens me that Bitcoin can't move forward simply because Chinese interests don't have the bandwidth or whatever
