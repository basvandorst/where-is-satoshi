exactly! i was talking about bitcoin and the investment opportunity , my mother was very interested so she said i'd give you kids some money to invest on bitcoins and you can keep the profit whenever you decide to sell them , so we bought 2 bitcoins (me and my older brother) and i said we should hold them in out paper wallet
but my genius brother said he wants to buy and sell on a website called Bittrex where you can turn your coins to USD instantly and buy again when it goes down a bit he kept doing it for 3 days and made like 30 bucks (/facepalm) then all the iranian accounts got disabled
i had strongly said that we shouldn't do this before he moved the coins like 5 times but he didn't listen i think we bought them at around 6000$ at the time and i was literally banging my head against the wall when it hit 20000$ i even called my family including my brother to my room and showed them [ when bitcoin was nearly 20k
we could have made 28k but instead we lost 12k oh man i was burning that day
TLDR: it wasn't my fault my brother did it! \*sad pepe\*
