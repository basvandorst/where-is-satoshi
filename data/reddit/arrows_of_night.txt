Indeed, sometimes we just need a break from all this worries. But I seldom got bored in online gambling because there are various of games I can choose from. Plus, there are event promos in every corner so I just play them whenever I am free. An example of site that I like the event promos is [VegasCasino]( About gambling, you wouldn't really get bored or tired from playing if you focus more on the entertainment value it holds rather than the potential income you can earn from it. Just enjoy the game I guess, earnings are just bonuses for me.

This would be the best strategy for me, after all, I play just for the sake of entertainment.

Indeed. Imagine winning a lot more than you gamble especially that the there's a bull run

Nothing comes easy, pal. But it is worth the time and effort. The bull run can greatly help us online gamblers to earn more through playing bitcoin gambling. Of course, the rate of success also depends of your skills as a gambler so sometimes, we are not lucky to maintain winning stakes.
So far, I don't yet get bored on playing online even though hours have already passed. Maybe because I shift to other games from time to time. If you've got time, you can check out [VegasCasino]( they have various games to choose from so I guess you won't get bored easily on this site. They also have promo for first time players when you deposit btc for the first time. With the sudden bull run, I think it will be a good deal right now. And  it doesn't stop there because they also have 2nd deposit bonus which I really appreciated when I was a newbie in online gambling. If you did check it out, feel free to tell me your feedback about it.
