Loaded 30$ worth of BTC onto my mobile wallet and went to one of the Farmer's Markets here in Little Rock today hoping to make my first purchase using it.  Didn't find a single merchant that had even heard of bitcoin, but one was very interested.

in the case of a decided fee, sure.  but not in the case of a voluntary tip.  and you can demand it back all you want, they have the right to refuse to make the return.  the extra was given freely.  If i say "keep the change", I can't go back later and demand my change.

hardly, the burden of care to make sure how much is being handing over is up to the payee.  bitcoin is designed to be a trustless algorithm.  I don't have to trust you to give me back my change, because I made the transaction happen that way.  I'm not saying they shouldn't ask for it back, or that the miner shouldn't give it back.  But it's entirely up to the payee to make sure that the transaction is set up properly.
I also see this similar to if the waiter brings my bill.  I put cash in the pocket to cover the fee and tip, and I get up and walk away.  Generally, and in most places, that is inferred "keep the change" no matter how much I left in the pocket.

I didn't intend to minimize the subject.  I'm sorry if I gave that impression.  
I am not surprised that a company with a particularly digital background would be willing to accept digital currency, especially when it positively impacts their bottom line.  (Reduced/nullified fees, etc.). 
Indeed, the detail tells me that other digitally oriented companies with armies of developers should be at least mildly interested, and that adoption is slowly increasing at the top of the proverbial food chain.  To me it's a no-brainier: Adoption by tech companies *should* be automatic and assumed at this point.  It's easier for them than for manufacturers, for instance.
It stands to reason that they would bring it to the masses.  It's their wheel-house.
A list of non-internet centric companies that accept or work with crypto-currency would be far more interesting.  It would tell us that they are actively pursuing adoption.  That is as opposed to obvious candidates giving lip service to considering their options.  (in my opinion, they have no other option.  It's going to happen sooner rather than later.)  It would also tell us more about where interest lies and what to focus on to further increase adoption.
Disclosure: I'm a dedicated hodler of several BTC, and my wife and friends are getting tired of hearing me "preach" about bitcoin.  Please don't think I'm trolling.
On that note, few that I talk to care much about digital goods or services, unless it enables them to receive media or physical goods. They buy on eBay or pay their cable/satellite bill online so they can keep watching espn, for example.  When they leave work, they are typically analog.  That is, except for the time they spend on Facebook or watching tv.
I man no offense, but focusing on this fairly narrow list of like-examples is akin to the preacher lecturing the choir.  We need to move on to finding ways to widen out.  
I don't see many employers offering to pay salary in bitcoin, for example.  Digital media is useful as a mouthpiece to spread awareness, but until a portion or all of their salary is paid in BTC these people aren't going to care a lick, incentive or not.

Most end customers, myself included, won't buy something sight-unseen.
I still don't see how this answers the credit aspect.  In the manufacturer I work for, when we start a new facility we "borrow" (i.e. on credit) the capital from corporate pools.  We haven't actually sold the product yet, but we buy material on forecast based on our market share incumbency and market outlook.  
This wouldn't be any different for a smaller manufacturer or even a retailer (i.e. a local woodworker or a manufacturer).  The retailer/customer hasn't bought the table yet, therefore the mill can't be paid to deliver without the end manufacturer borrowing against collateral or credit.  And it goes backwards through the supply chain.  The logger can't be paid until the mill gets paid, who can't be paid until the manufacturer gets paid...etc etc.
Your scenario assumed the Store is already established and has a pool of liquid capital...but how does a start-up get up and running?
@_date: 2014-02-22 16:59:01
The problem is that your BTC has already been spent by the (now-defunct) manufacturer.  The up-stream suppliers have doubtless already spent the BTC that was given them...etc etc.
This is the down-side of pre-sale and investment.  Its a crap-shoot.

This isn't exactly finders keepers.  This is more like meaning to leave a $10 service tip and accidentally dropping a $100 note.  Once the tip is collected, the transaction is settled.  Remember that the bitcoin transaction was digitally signed with the private key, pebkac mistake or not.

To what accusation are you referring?  I simply don't see how the correlation is significant.  
One should expect a company that provides content to accept as many payment forms as possible.  That would keep their product open to as wide an audience as possible.  At the very least, it doesn't artificially limit their revenues to a closed range of prospective customers.
It would be dramatically more significant if typically closed-minded organizations began accepting BTC for goods and services.

Not much, but that doesn't matter.  
If they wrote a paper and offered arguments in a logical fashion, and the point was to write the paper, they'd likely get a &gt;0 score.  Just because I don't agree with their viewpoint, doesn't mean their work was poor.

Let's flip that around, just for the exercise.  If the teacher believed in evolution and op wrote a paper supporting creationism, I think there's as much risk of getting a 0.  The athiest-evolutionist people I know are more dismissive of creationist beliefs, and are more aggressive about spreading their anti-religious information, than the other way around.

That article is a joke.  It says BTC isn't even the top choice...and what does Monero having lower transaction fees have to do with hackers choice to steal it?  
Theft of BTC, or even crypto as a whole, is peanuts versus $ stolen...

You just hear about crypto scandals more because its the new thing, and it's a direct threat to the financial status quo.  Everybody knows $ get stolen all the time, there's nothing newsworthy there.

There's no difference really.  Unless the student went completely off subject from assignment, the subject shouldn't have any bearing on the grade.  The point of the class is proper writing technique.  The paper doesn't have to actually change the instructor's opinion.
In this case, OP wrote a paper about a subject, and there is no reasonable argument against it being part of economics.  Yet the instructor threw it out because he just doesn't like Bitcoin and what it stands for.  Shame on him.
