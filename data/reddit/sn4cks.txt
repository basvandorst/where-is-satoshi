what is your favorite memory or personal experience pertaining to bitcoin?
best wishes on your cakeday!
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:05:57
Veldt Gold is pretty solid too from what I've seen! 
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:37:30
Not sure of the answer to your main question, but Fidor is an extremely bitcoin-friendly bank. Well worth looking into! :D
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:00:55
they sell tramadol, 150mg and 200mg ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I'm not disagreeing with you, but if I remember correctly Third Key generates their key independently and then splits it up around the globe.
Geographical diversity with the intent of hindering subpoenas in my eyes :D
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:00:55
I'm not gonna lie, I chuckled when I saw the Sea Shepherd website on there. It made me think of the South Park depiction of those guys.
And then I went to their website and saw that Pamela Anderson had just been added to their board of advisors. What is going on in the world..

Best wishes to the crypto community!
Thanks for spreading the word of good causes too!

you can get herb or snacks :D so exciting.
I wish I lived in Seattle
@_date: 2015-05-07 00:17:26
there is a very young subreddit worth mentioning - :D it launched just a few days ago so things are very much in progress, but it is a video hosting site that features direct tipping to content creators in BTC, LTC, or Doge. coming along nicely so far!
didn't see it mentioned after a quick glance through, apologies if it is a duplicate

gamble ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2015-08-31 12:51:04
might be able to help you out with this one

ZaZZZ is a medical marijuana vending machine that only accepts cash and bitcoin for similar reasons.
Also the first btc vending machine in NJ was recently placed in a bong shop. It could happen!
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:58:56
same ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:58:48

@_date: 2015-08-11 18:21:02
Not sure if you have checked out [Beepi]( but it is worth looking in to.
They accept btc and deliver cars to your door with a bow on them.
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:07:09
Damn! Sorry for the misleading info. 
Hopefully the situation changes and best of luck on the hunt!
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:18:56
I might be wrong on this, but after searching CoinBase support there was no noticeable mention of an age limit.
If you have a high school checking account, maybe you can link that? then print off an online statement to use as verification along with a photo ID.
@_date: 2015-07-17 03:58:05
somebody please make a rival crypto. name it Shiticoin.
I'd pump that coin.
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:41:23
1. go to the DMV and get a state ID card 
2. print out a bank statement with your address on it
3. ???
4. profit
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:14:36
No, full pump. I'd lose a fair amount of money just to read a headline that says something along the lines of 'Citicoin rival Shiticoin is dumping on the competition'
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:50:48
So what do you guys think about Palladium ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2015-07-24 01:32:08
meant that in the sense that Palladium has actual real-world uses, which gives me some peace of mind. Besides the recent drop Palladium has been doing better than the recovering bear of Gold
I love you though EDIT: and obviously Bitcoin  4lyfe. Just pointing out the benefits of other metals

HB 289 is the bill in question, going through the senate rounds now.
@_date: 2015-07-27 09:28:38
Impressive turnaround time on that order, especially with the steep discount! Location could indeed be a factor.
Has Purse made any changes to the operation recently? I ordered some stuff about two months ago at only ~%12 and it took about a week and a half.
guess that could be from less buyers at the time too.
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:25:35
I did some research on this bill when it was first going through the NC House of Reps, and you are 100% correct in your assumption.
If you want to do business with a North Carolina resident, you have to play by their rules.
It's funny because BTC is defined as property, so NC and their Office of the Commissioner of Banks are basically going against the IRS by treating it this way.
@_date: 2015-07-24 00:35:34
I would say probably not for that one. If you don't have a drivers license, no worries. You can go to the DMV and get an Identification Card for ten bucks or so? They are pretty handy if you are waiting to get a license but still need to prove that you are a person and whatnot.
Gotta bring the required documents, so check your local department website for what is required.
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:24:45
thanks amigo :D
@_date: 2015-09-07 05:40:33
it is a digital card, you scan the card from your smartphone screen. It's pretty much meant to be your main card for reloading and getting coffee with :D
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:20:43
THIS. PO boxes are cheap and an easy fix.
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:15:34
happy sunday buddy!
will be directing this satoshi to my twitch stream viewers :D
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:55:47
by the time you recognize bitcoin as a competitor, it's too late 
@_date: 2015-09-06 19:41:58
If it's for Starbucks, use [fold]( They also have a service available for Target gift cards!
And for anything else, I've always used [Gyft]( Solid website with many options.
@_date: 2015-09-16 14:02:18
could we at least say 'awkwardly frequent?'
there was another shooting on a college campus yesterday, those reporters got shot two weeks ago, and I'm sure there was one two weeks or so before that.

I use a torch from Lowes :P

can anyone vouch for the vid quality on popcorntime? I have only been able to find a terrible quality cam otherwise
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:48:12
seconded if anyone has some inside knowledge or insight into how this works. all I can tell is that our new plant overlords will give us btc if we grow new plants for them?
@_date: 2015-10-24 23:41:50
Good call on this one, I went back and read my post to realize it makes no sense at all.
I'm rather inebriated.
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:50:47
Upvoting for visibility, thank you for the transparency during all these shenanigans :D
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:47:24
After reading through the site I think you are correct about the plant being a representation of the DAO. Not entirely sure how this system works even after scouring the site hahaha

I use breadwallet personally, and in their most recent update they included a bit to adjust tx fees accordingly. It has been working well.
If breadwallet doesn't meet your needs I would recommend checking bither out. I haven't used it in some time but I have known them as a smart wallet choice in the past.
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:04:32
Fuck yeah man, thanks for the quick response. I know what to do when I get home now :D
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:03:53
If you can import the private keys from elec2 into a non-electrum wallet that might be worth a shot, but that's all I've got here. I wouldn't even take my advice - I'd be doing the same thing you are by asking for help.
Hopefully someone who has been in this exact situation will come through with advice.
Best wishes mate
