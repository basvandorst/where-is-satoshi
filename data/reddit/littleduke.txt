Combined with the elements of PERSECUTION in the story for a "don't shoot the messenger" sub-plot is just laughable!  
"Here go do this job, take it seriously and now because we don't like the answer you're giving us we're going to punish you for it!"
Right...a REAL report would have been generically on cryptocurrencies generally and not Bitcoin specific.
It totally falls apart here "...instead everything will superceded by bitcoin."

I think the system will likely accept the TX upon payment broadcast -- might be a good time to ping the Kriptokit guy's about adding in Litecoin and Dogecoin options for super easy "in browser" payment options?

I got one from Hormel in the dot-com era for having an "anti-spam" software/service...they have to do the token "defensive" moves -- I wouldn't sweat it -- they know that ANY PRESS is good press after a while...

This is a classic SHILL story pattern -- don't believe a word of it.  The fact that the author is now "traveling and can't comment" is another TELL.

It largely doesn't matter who Satoshi is.  Frankly wouldn't you rather it be a recluse like this over "a cartel of london bankers" -- or worse, Mark Karpeles?

Do you plan to mirror Coinbase ability to simply buy and hold Bitcoins?

Is your phone backed up to a cloud provider that perhaps got hacked?

Exactly!  I just used a similar analogy to explain Bitcoin to a 12 year old.  "Abbycoin" starts with 50 coins and account  sends 10 coins to account   etc.
I explained the reward as the means to start a new page in the spreadsheet by finding a number that when you add all the transactions together when multiplied by it gets a number that has N zero's at the end -- its a "challenging math puzzle" and who ever finds the number with the most zero's wins that round and the next page in the spreadsheet has 50 more coins in that persons account.

I'd like to see one of those guys buy them out -- crypto currencies aren't quite mainstream just yet and this would give them access to a whole new audience

Need more merchants transacting with each other using Bitcoin -- and less of the fiat/gateway drains IMHO

I see a "virtuous cycle" forming in charitable giving here!  
An artist gives a little to a charity and the charity promotes watching the video to it's members which is an easy way to help something go viral!

What better way to pay for your future re-animation than to create a currency that is inflation proof and has the best chance of outlasting you?

I have yet to see anyone’s math on showing that mining is more profitable than just buying and HODLing...
For one you miss out on forks when you flip to fiat to pay for power
Secondly even if you are not paying for power you have capital expenditures, repair and depreciation costs plus your time.
FWIW: i have been in space since 2009 and built the legendary “Octo-BAMT”

KYC only matters if you need to exchange your pure digital goodness for some nasty-ass filthy paper money backed by guns and debt...
You're better than that...

Yeah if you like paying for overage and excess bandwidth for ZERO benefit.
The Bitcoin protocol is broken!  We need:
1. Pay to Peer
2. Pay to Post

I nailed it again, 10 years running!  One year from today, mark my words, One Bitcoin will be worth 1 BTC!   You can HODL on that :-)

Here's the thing about Warren Buffett that most people do not know:  He owns several "Press Release" newswire services.  He has since the telex days, the fax days and now the internet days.
It means that old fraud has had the ability to see INSIDE information before the rest of the market for longer than you and I have probably been alive.   And trade on it without being considered an "insider".
He hates Bitcoin because he has ZERO ability to profit from it before anyone else.
His shitty Berk A shares represent a slice of a global conglomerate -- not a global economy.

Prediction!  In the future, 1BTC will be worth 1BTC!
