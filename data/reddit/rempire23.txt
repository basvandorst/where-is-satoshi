Yes, unless you think it’s a bubble that will inflate a bit more, before it will pop. Than the question is, when will it pop? The investment then becomes temporary, a.k.a. Trade. I do understand how fiat currencies work vs BTC. I just think that Unless BTC will re-invent itself and would instead of being built up from lost electricity, that it’s value would actually be more built up in some sort of real value, and that somehow each BTC, or better said, each Satoshi, would hold a endless intrinsic energy (value) to always pay for its own transactions, like a perpetuum mobile coin, or a solar powered coin. I think eventually the winning crypto will have to be cheapest and easiest to use as that’s where it’s real potential lays. Perhaps the big Tech giants will not be allowed to develop such coin, but I do think it would help if the public / users know and trust the people behind it and that they know that the coin can upgrade itself over time. A coin based on technology that wouldn’t be upgradable in the easiest and most efficient way, would in my opinion also be dead in the water. Can BTC do all of that? Or can any other existing coin do all of that? That would be the value of the coin, not how much electricity it took to create a coin that in fact is the same as the first ones created that hardly costed anything, like BTC. That’s exactly what a bubble is. Pay more and more for exactly the same until people realize what it actually is, or isn’t.

Thanks for your reply. I will put a sell limit on my final BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:10:06
And the bubble goes pop!
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:47:28
Please tell us your dip number U’ll be buying at?
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:20:07
At what dip figure will u buy?
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:12:29
If everyone was buying, the price wouldn’t drop...
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:35:22
We’ll see
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:19:47
So what happens when all BTC is mined, who will take care of the transactions then? Sorry for asking perhaps ignorant questions, I’m just trying to learn.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:13:04
Hilarious:) I bought my first BTC at $800 and probably own a multiple of urs;)
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:57:39
Please argue all my points if you can. Your answer means nothing and is not unique to Bitcoin. May the best coin win. I’ll bet you the final winning coins probably don’t exist yet.
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:10:05
What about usability? Why do so many bitcoiners think that just holding on to bitcoin will increase, or even hold its value. I bought my first BC for 800 usd and have been buying and selling, but still today it has not proven itself to be so useful. In fact, none of the crypto’s has proven to be useful, nor stabile. I actually think that the Libra might have a chance due to Facebooks users broad platform. If the Libra is smart and has some advantages over fiat currencies, then it could work. It doesn’t need to go up or down too much either, stability would actually be a strength too. People in all sorts of places around the world where local currencies are fucked up could then switch to it. It’s about users and usability. Bitcoin is not gold. Gold is gold. I ride the BC bubble until it pops. It might even go up to 20k, 30k etc. but eventually it will pop. Mark my words;) The real question for BC is what will it do over the next few days and that’s the only question you should continue to ask yourselves if you want gain some wealth, by trading that is. You want to hold on to something that gains value? Buy property in a good location, hell you can even do that with borrowed money.

@_date: 2019-07-16 17:51:41
I wish. I foolishly held on to mine... ;)
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:48:29
LOL, this is such garbage. It shows bitcoins flaws. The whole point of gold is that you can touch it and actually weigh it, therefore it’s not comparable with a invisible super unstable bitcoin that gets tons of bottleneck problems at higher use...
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:40:05
So it has no intrinsic value, right? You mean like a bubble...!
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:31:09
Ok, the keys are....
@_date: 2019-07-15 08:14:05
See me here:
1. What to do about more congestion’s in the future at a higher use? Why is there no buffer system built in for future trades / transactions? If the payment system is only real time and market based, what guarantees its speed and low costs?
2. Exactly, but this then goes back to my point 1 above. 
3. All of this still relates to my point 1... Meanwhile the USD and EUR are pretty stabile and payments work well. Not just one payment system, but many. I’m not saying I don’t see the downsides to that system, but I do also see the downsides to the BC system and find that a more interesting topic.
4. No one knows who started it all. What if the Rothchilds themselves did it? Nobody knows. I see no advantage for not knowing this...
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:48:05
Of course I agree, but I already said so much more than that. I explained why Bitcoin is weak and what a better crypto currency could look like. One with actual intrinsic value so payments are always fastest and cheapest, unlike Bitcoin. A bitcoin transaction is safe, quick and cheap, but not at all times. How does it even work when all Bitcoins are mined? Who will calculate each transaction? How will the speed and low transaction costs be guaranteed? Scarcity might sound attractive, but usability will win 100000000x over. The GBP (Great British Pound) is more rare than the USD, but there’s a higher demand for USD as it dominates the world trade. Bitcoin could easily be a scam, a bubble, like the famous black tulip bubble in the 17th century.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:22:55
That’s my whole point. A crypto currency should have intrinsic value like a battery that’s always charged, or automatically gets charged and therefore its transaction fee would always be 100% free of charge / paid for by itself. That should be the whole point (that and the other blockchain advantages). Look we can argue all day long about how holy bitcoin is, but one day a more perfect crypto will take over. Bitcoin being the first is like saying the Sony Walkman being the first.  People can small talk all they want, but believe it or not, I’m trying to have a real conversation here and I’m sorry if I hurt bitcoin’s feelings. People saying that bitcoin is the new gold, is ludicrous. Gold is gold because it’s tangible. Bitcoin is not even visible and is based on technology while technological innovation is accelerating and therefore is doomed. This does not mean it can’t go up. But what it does mean that it eventually will come down, the same way that the I-pod killed the Walkman and then later Spotify killed I-tunes.
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:38:57
1. Let BTC go down to 8.5k, then buy it.
2. Let BTC go down to 7k, then buy more. 
3. Let BTC go down to 4.5k... wait
4. Wait...
5. See BTC hit 3.2k .... wait
6. See BTC hit 1.8k ..... wait
7. Wait, regret, wait...
8. Regret...

@_date: 2019-07-16 19:17:31
Hey, let’s do some predictions and see where it goes. I think BTC could go above 10k again in the next 48hrs. What do you think?
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:08:13
Was in bitcoin. To make a profit and because I believe in the principle. Just lost faith in bitcoin along the way. The winning crypto needs to be more user friendly than fiat currencies. I don’t mind transparency, I’m pro paying my fair share of taxes and I’ve got nothing to hide, like the majority of people. The bitcoin echo chamber does not represent society.
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:54:02
Totally, I bought my first BC at $800 and have also bought at $12k. Like I say, ride the bubble, but I see BC still as a VHS video tape. Something that worked early, but was replaced by better systems over and over again. I’m skeptical about bitcoin because I see flaws and bottlenecks. What are it’s flaws according to you? And how will it’s problems be solved and how were existing problems already solved? BC is not gold as it’s simply not tangible. You can’t wear it around your neck and it is dependable on both a power grid and the internet. I’m not here to spread negativity, but I’m here to share my concerns and to learn. I feel that a large amount of bitcoin fans don’t know what they are talking about and are sheepish parrots in a echo chamber mostly dropping one liner comments. Meanwhile the markets are driven by a small bunch of big bulls. The trends show nothing more than that really. Please correct me if I’m wrong about that? If the community was so strong then let’s organize a bitcoin sell strike for 48 hrs and people only buy. The price should go up, as less people would budge. My guess would be this would have no affect as it’s all bull driven.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:27:37
What’s with the name calling?
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:50:49
Duh! But the trust holds its value, or at least 1000000x better than rollercoaster sooner or later pop BTC. Hey, don’t get me wrong, i actually (still own) BTC, possibly more than all you who commented on my posts.
@_date: 2019-07-19 12:36:33
As if that makes it the equivalent of gold or something. Gold does not have soon to be outdated technology embedded, you can weigh it and you can hang it around your neck. I wouldn’t compare let’s say empty VHS tapes or floppy disks with gold either. BTC is eventually not here to stay, but the real question remains, will BTC still go up before it eventually collapses? I’m starting to think that it actually might not and that more and more people will start to see BTC’s flaws and limitations.

@_date: 2019-11-16 23:09:59
Name me one technology that kept its value and wasn’t replaced by something better over time? Besides that, the actual functionality of bitcoin is not that great. It does not get cheaper to use if its use goes up, and it even slows down. Fail!
@_date: 2019-11-19 07:54:06
@_date: 2019-11-18 05:51:37
Because it’s not being used and not being useful. And if used then slows down and transaction price goes up. Fail!
@_date: 2019-11-19 05:28:15
The fact that this is worth talking about, says a lot about how pathetic bitcoin has become...
@_date: 2019-11-10 04:33:18
Not eating it and wasting food is similar to buying bitcoin and not using it and just wasting money, unless it goes up, which it won’t, especially if no one is using it. And if everyone would start using their bitcoins then the actual transaction costs would not be cheap, nor would it be fast; a.k.a. the big flaws of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:38:22
I’m gonna buy at 7.8, then buy at 7.4, then at 6.9 and at 6.5. Hell I might even buy at 6.2, I really don’t know when to stop. But my faith in bitcoin is only going to get stronger .Haha, I’m going to be rich!!!! lLamborghini, here we come!!!

@_date: 2019-10-23 19:14:59
If you look at the past 4 months you can see a downwards trend. Other than some blind bitcoin faith, there are no indicators for its improvements. So why buy now? If you are trading you could perhaps buy now, but don’t forget to sell when it’s a bit up. Also, even if bitcoin would again gain popularity, it’s still not the best and cheapest payment method, so any crypto that does that better can beat bitcoin. I would even put my bet on Libra, as I expect it to be a smart and efficient coin and already has a huge platform through FB and instagram.
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:20:59
