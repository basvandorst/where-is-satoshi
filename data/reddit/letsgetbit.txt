No crypto can compare to bitcoins scaling except ethereum. Ether is massive in it's circulating amount. Bitcoin has a tiny available amount on the market comparatively. It's much easier to move the price up on satoshi's coin. It's the ultimate hype coin. Bitcoin also pays dividends in hardforks and airdrops.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:23:31
Biggest network by many metrics, fully decentralized without a leader, longest track record of success, extremely low circulating amount, best reason might be hardforks. I sold free Bitcoin cash at $2,500. This took me 2 minutes to come up with.

people have been saying this for a while. Bitcoin will have it's pumps when the other Alts are dumping.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:45:28
Coinbase letting people buy Bcash and not sell drives up Bitcoins competitor. It's also becoming clearer to people what side Coinbase has chosen. 2018 will be the year coinbase tries to kill bitcoin. How many alts will they add?

That's what they said in May. And September. And December. Altcoins can't kill BTC especially one with 10 billion coins. XRP might be a quicker cheaper crypto but it's not nearly what Bitcoin is in terms of store of value. Math... It matters.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:11:39
Forks, Cryptos biggest fan base, no central leader (sometimes a flaw), trust of companies entering crypto (saw something on japanese employers paying partial salaries in bitcoin, stuff like that hasn't gotten too the altcoins yet. ETF and Wall street will likely buy bitcoin before feeling comfortable in this asset class). Ripple and all these altcoins just started scaling this year they don't have the trust or history that's required for conservative investors.

LN and Segwit? Soon?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:17:28
Cobinhood is way better with 0 fees anyway. Can't wait until they enable Fiat deposit. Binance is pretty awesome too. I'm looking into bitstamp and Gemini too.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:34:41
So Coinbase loves Bcash and won't let us sell it yet but still won't support segwit? Coinbase? more like Cashbase. Am I right?

I use abra over Coinbase now because ach bank transfers only take 2-3 days and they don’t charge fees on the buy. The price is usually a little higher by a dollar or 2, though. Tried BRD wallet but they use kraken’s horrible kyc company, glidera.

Crypto vs cash in Venezuela right now. You’re right. Think in terms of % and you’ll gain perspective. What % of the population of globe can’t use crypto? What % of the time can’t those people use crypto? Crypto works for 99% of the people 99% of the time. Can’t work with electricity. Cash works for 99% of people but is printed by central banks with no self control. Nothing is perfect. Keep everything in cash waiting for us to turn into Venezuela.

@_date: 2019-02-27 07:23:51
During a debt crises everyone is going to buy more government debt? The Fed hasn’t finished its automatic selling of us bonds too. We’ve never had a recession start with negative interest rates before either. Foreign governments are cashing in us bonds, social security is going to be cashing out soon, millennials won’t touch the things and hedge funds will be slowly selling as boomers draw on pensions and 401k’s.
@_date: 2019-06-05 02:35:59
Everyone needs to realize that right now Bitcoin isn’t anonymous. If exchanges are going to ban select bitcoins and governments shut down mixers then the community will have to push for anonymity through upgrades. The coders will have to do it. Or we can have XMR fill that niche but that seems like a temporary solution.

Wrong. Miners are sellers. Buyers generally hold. Miners pay bills by selling BTC. They are the biggest downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.

That fact that Bitcoin can’t be shut off by government or banks is a really big deal to a lot of us. A lot of people’s first exposure to bitcoin was to donate to Wikileaks. Wikileaks is partly responsible for Bitcoin’s price increase too. The two both represent liberty and freedom in two systems (financial and press) that are extremely lacking of honest choices.

I knew that Bloomberg was running hit pieces it’s interesting to see everything traced back to a blogger.

A deflationary currency is a terrible single currency. You and everyone else are missing the point if you think Bitcoin will replace the $. There’s room for both a deflationary and inflationary currency. Bitcoin will eat a lot of the global currencies up because the central banks have flooded the market with fiats. These $ have to go somewhere.

Yep. People freak out now at 3% interest, they’re sick. They’ve gotten used to negative interest rates.

A lot of fortunes would be lost if it was easy to short bitcoin. But yours makes sense. An asset that’s gone from sub $0.01 to 6k in ten years is a sucker bet. You’re better off buying stocks that can be printed and diluted at will.

Start using a wallet that lets you store your own crypto after buying like BRD or Abra. I love abra since I switched from CB
@_date: 2019-05-05 05:57:03
Yeah I use the same one but I still buy with abra so that I don’t worry about moving my BTC as soon as it clears. Abra is also faster for me at releasing my funds. 
The nano s only holds 2 or 3 cryptos and isn’t the easiest way to move them so I only keep a small chunk in my ledger nano s. I would have bought the nano x if I knew what I know now.

Don’t pay attention to the downvotes. You understand what crypto is about. Competition helps Bitcoin. Downvoters are afraid because they can’t clearly see the big picture. Bitcoin is stronger in a lot of ways from the forks. I sell BTC forks for more BTC. Forks, copies, and other cryptos were actually necessary in parts of 2017, when BTC was slowing down.

You might find cheaper and faster coins but they won’t be as trustworthy or known.  BTC’s history and leaderless ship make it slow to change but it’s a good thing. Eventually BTC is forced to adopt next gen tech, after its been proven. So much tech exists, or will, that is designed to lessen the load on BTC or swap between other chains. Scaling should keep up with a few hiccups. Bitcoin has been cheap and fast for most of its life. At some point you’re splitting hairs between these tokens. This ones pennies and takes 30 seconds, the other one is half a penny and takes a second. But to use the faster one I have to move my BTC into something called Bcash or Ripple? I’m fine paying slightly more and waiting longer.

Because of the high fees and barriers to entry in traditional markets. I don’t think of bitcoin as a currency, it’s more like gold than dollars to most of us. You’re looking at such a small sample size to get those stats. Over time bitcoin has proven itself. I ain’t scared but I’ve been buying bitcoin for 2 years now, every paycheck, bi-weekly. I’m still in the positive because most of the bitcoin I bought was under this current price.
