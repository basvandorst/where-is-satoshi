What are trying to say?

AHH! My first bits! Thank you.

As a salaried comedy writer I declare this to be a solid joke.

I'd use them at pizza hut. That's what I'd do.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:58:54
I can't think of anything cool to say. ):

Based on this comment I'll refer to you as " bitter Nostradamus".

It's interesting to read a digital photo of a print article about a revolutionary digital currency.
It's like talking on a cellphone to someone on a landline telling me about virtual reality.

I think you're missing the big picture. Bitcoin provides a new way of moving money around. This is very attractive to anyone involved in commerce.

Someone that fully understands this should update coinbase's Wikipedia entry. I just checked and it's not there yet.
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:25:24
This is a good step.

A certain level of form is required to manifest something. A bunch of smart but indecisive people can only take something so far.

In my opinion, the sequence of events surrounding and involving bitcoin are good things. The price flies, proving that it can represent serious value. Now, it gets exposure and becomes embedded in our culture. People begin stealing it and basically treating it like a real commodity, albeit presumably for short-term gain. Though, this doesn't stop the average person from seeing this as an indication of it's legitimacy. 
Now it falls and the average person now has more knowledgable and access to btc. 
This leads me to assume that the doom preachers are simply trying to scare people away. This situation couldn't be more advantageous.
How could someone honestly think it would simply rise rise rise? The current must move around and people must have experiential proof of it. The possibility of experiential proof is what separates btc from gold and other commodities. One cannot buy a coffee with a block of gold. The key is to take this out of the niche. The niche is a global currency's antithesis.

I'm not sure if you're pointing out my poor sentence or being incredulous towards my viewpoint.
Either way. Yes, in my opinion, the sequence of events surrounding and involving bitcoin   are good things.

Hey, are you trying to have some sort of insight type thing? Humanity isn't a "problem". Humanity is a word that symbolizes something beyond comprehension. This mystery is one of the fillings in a burrito that is even more obscure. Your attitude is, however, a major problem. First of all, everything your saying is boring and backwards. The whole thing is a bunch of reletivistic universal statements. What's with people reading history, making trite poetic generalizations, and then walking off feeling they've made some awesome point? You don't know shit, friend. Be an untainted  part of the fresh whole. Don't be the poop smeared gear you currently are.

Short sighted is better than blind.

People with poor syntax sure are assholes.
@_date: 2015-01-24 04:35:24
I agree. An impatient, ostensibly elitist attitude benefits no one. Bitcoin really needs communicators in the vein of Neil deGrasse Tyson.
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:03:04
Whoa! Imagine how much more you could change if you weren't obsessed with other people. You've been tricked into thinking statistics mean anything. Everything is about one very basic thing; emotion. People are awful when they are afraid. People aren't shifty for the hell of it.
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:10:20
Criticizing people for hypothetical wrongdoings isn't of any value. You're not being reasonable or helpful.
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:59:25
Coinbase doesn't own bitcoin in general. There is nothing bad about proving the legitimacy of block chain technology. Bitcoin is only a stepping stone. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:21:31
Haha! Thanks.

I'll trade an original bad joke for some bits? Why did the camping family hide their food in trees? Because they were bearanoid.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:24:40
Me want bits, please!?
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:25:44
Swanks!
