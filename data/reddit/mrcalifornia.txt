I'm pretty confused. I am likely not gonna hit any of the large numbers. Does that mean every time I buy something with Bitcoin I will pay .15% of the transaction cost as a fee (for now, and .25% after the intro period)?

Isn't this the point of step by step guides? I'm an expert in many subjects and a novice in almost everything. So if I need to learn something it's nice of am expert in that thing can lay it out in an easy way for me to understand. That's the first step in me becoming an expert in that new thing just like I did in every other subject I've ever learned.

Hence the "step by step". Obviously looking for the right order.

I would think the media publishing a bunch of "Bitcoin at all time high" pieces will cause some additional interest from new parties.

You need to have more money sitting in cash at Gemini than you have deposited waiting to clear. So if you keep putting in money each day and then buying you won't be able to transfer any. But if you sell enough to cover the last 3-5 days of deposits then you can transfer your BTC.

Rakuten.com is what used to be Buy.com. Global.rakuten.com is a separate site that is a place where Japanese sellers can list their inventory for sale in other countries they are willing to ship to. 
This news is just for Rakuten.com and not all Rakuten sites. 
Source: I used to be a PM at Rakuten. Good company. I would imagine they will spread this to the rest of the sites eventually but I'm out of the loop now.
