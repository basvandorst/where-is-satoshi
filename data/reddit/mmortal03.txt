Yeah, you're right -- 0.13.0 has a lot of cool stuff, but it doesn't roll out SegWit, so, as far as the more "controversial" issues, 0.13.1 would be the bigger deal. Even with 0.13.1, people don't *have* to upgrade to it. One guy's opinion on the matter that I just came across:

It's difficult to say. I'm not in the business of running a crypto exchange. Off the top of my head, remaining conservative with the coins that you do add, and segregating access to them so that everything doesn't go down with the ship. Possibly even having independent sites for each major USD to crypto pair that you run, but, you know people are all about one stop shops and will say that that's not practical. 
I know that's not a very specific answer. It's a tough balance, because people want to trade "all the coins", but it's practically difficult to have the resources to run a secure exchange for all of them, because your security staff simply can't be experts on all of them.

I hear you, but it's still better than using the word 'blockchain' as an uncountable noun the way people often market it. When I hear people talking about how 'blockchain' is going to revolutionize finance, I think to myself 'blockchain' what?
As an analogy, back in the 90s it wasn't 'World Wide Web' or 'Internet' that were going to revolutionize things, it was *the* World Wide Web or *the* Internet that were going to do so. If you didn't believe that the Internet, specifically as an entity, was going to do it (similar to not believing in *the* Bitcoin blockchain), then computer networks or computer network technology would've been a fine way to describe what you thought would do so. 'Blockchain technology' fits in this same category, not 'blockchain'.

lol, the USA hasn't made an all encompassing ruling that bitcoins are a commodity and not a currency, but only if bitcoins were legally treated as a foreign currency might FDIC insurance apply:
"(c)  Deposits maintained by foreigners and deposits denominated in foreign currency.  The availability of deposit insurance is not limited to citizens and residents of the United States. Any person or entity that maintains deposits in an insured depository institution is entitled to the deposit insurance provided by the Act and this part. In addition, deposits denominated in a foreign currency shall be insured in accordance with this part. Deposit insurance for such deposits shall be determined and paid in the amount of United States dollars that is equivalent in value to the amount of the deposit denominated in the foreign currency as of close of business on the date of default of the insured depository institution. The exchange rates to be used for such conversions are the 12 PM rates (the "noon buying rates for cable transfers") quoted for major currencies by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the date of default of the insured depository institution, unless the deposit agreement specifies that some other widely recognized exchange rates are to be used for all purposes under that agreement, in which case, the rates so specified shall be used for such conversions.
(d)  Deposits in insured branches of foreign banks.  Deposits in an insured branch of a foreign bank which are payable by contract in the United States shall be insured in accordance with this part, except that any deposits to the credit of the foreign bank, or any office, branch, agency or any wholly owned subsidiary of the foreign bank, shall not be insured. All deposits held by a depositor in the same right and capacity in more than one insured branch of the same foreign bank shall be added together for the purpose of determining the amount of deposit insurance."

Actually, from what I've read, the code did not appear to have been written by a professional programmer.

@_date: 2016-08-03 21:28:15
Yeah, essentially, people can't access their ETH, ETC, or LTC on Bitfinex because their BTC accounts were hacked. Coinbase has also added support for ETH, so, if either their BTC or ETH accounts are ever hacked, it will bring down access to the accounts of the otherwise unaffected coin, impacting the price of that other coin. Not only does this link multiple cryptocurrency *prices* systemically, but it also requires exchanges to keep tabs on how to properly secure more than one, *and* to track security exploits for more than one. At least Coinbase isn't yet adding "all the coins", but the more they do add, the more they will have to keep track of to be able to responsibly hold them for their users.

Yeah, the sooner that a significant number of such individuals not ideologically opposed to SegWit are running it, the lower the fees will be for everyone (until we approach the limit again) -- and that's even for the people who don't upgrade. So, the only reason I can think of that bigblockers would be against it is that they *also* see SegWit as part of some evil Blockstream conspiracy.

No changes are necessary to the GUI of *any* Bitcoin wallet to *send* to a SegWit address. Coinbase just needs to have their backend generate SegWit deposit addresses and present those to their users to deposit to, which the Bitcoin Core backend already supports doing.

If they implement it, it will help reduce the cost of transactions even for people not using them, because we still use the same blockchain.

Regarding what?
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:19:25
For sure, *no* company can do *everything* at once. They all have to prioritize. Part of the criticism has revolved around *what* they've prioritized. We might assume that their backend is in such bad shape due to unforeseen issues from past development decisions that it's made it especially difficult to add another deposit address type. If that's true (and it's just an assumption), hopefully they've recently brought on some quality devs to fix that soon so that they can add SegWit deposit addresses. Batching transactions, however, is something that is long overdue.
Based on things that Brian Armstrong has said publicly, though, it doesn't seem to be just unforeseen technical issues that they've run into that's caused this situation. The tweet saying that they'd have to hire more developers before they could implement SegWit seemed to demonstrate that they hadn't even started to work on it, let alone working on batching transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:48:53
Those are givens, though, for *any* company. Having devs *separated* from those areas and working on other goals is also important and happening, and where *that* dev work is spent is what people are talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:57:08
lol, no, don't misunderstand me, I'm not happy with them dragging their heels on this. Me suspecting that Coinbase will wait until then is not me endorsing their actions. Quite the opposite.

The good reason was to get the backend working first so that businesses could add it sooner. The GUI is almost there, but no changes need to be made to Bitcoin wallets to *deposit* to P2SH SegWit addresses, which is what people are asking Coinbase to add.


Whatever problems you are talking about, they don't affect exchanges using P2SH SegWit deposit addresses, as any Bitcoin wallet can send to those without updating.

No, I don't think it means that there is something wrong. It doesn't faze me that an open source software project has to make fundamental improvements at some point and then has to deal with getting others to adopt those changes to take its functionality to the next level.

I just tried it, and the price was something like 1.2% above the GDAX price, so it seems to be in the ballpark of Coinbase. Btw, when I went to buy, I had to give them my name, birthday, and last four of my SSN. To withdraw, I had to take a picture of my driver's license and then a photo of myself (this verification is currently in progress, so I haven't withdrawn the BTC yet). I read in a comment above that they are currently paying the Bitcoin transaction fee on withdrawal, so that's better than Coinbase (of course, GDAX also pays transaction fees for you). I'll be interested to see if Square is batching their transactions or not.

@_date: 2018-01-02 20:45:03
For Coinbase to help significantly reduce their contribution to the block weight, it doesn't require people to have SegWit addresses in the Bitcoin Core GUI at all. Coinbase just needs to implement SegWit address generation on *their* end, on the *backend*, which *any* Bitcoin wallet can then deposit to. Bitcoin Core already supports generating SegWit addresses on the backend. They prioritized this first so that businesses like Coinbase could then implement it.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:39:13
My previous post was from over two months ago, so I don't know how exactly you came across it, but I'm still willing to reply. :)
Actually, Bitcoin Core already *does* have the ability to generate SegWit addresses, on the backend. The devs specifically focused on that first because that's what businesses can use as a reference (or directly) to generate SegWit addresses, not the Bitcoin Core GUI. It was also more practical for blocksize reasons to release something that businesses could use first to set up deposit addresses, because that's where much of the volume is, and any Bitcoin wallet is already able to send *to* a SegWit address that a business generates.
For many *individuals* who would like to *receive* Bitcoins to a SegWit address and would like to use the Bitcoin Core GUI, they can currently generate a SegWit address in the console menu, but I'd actually suggest that they use a hardware wallet like Trezor for that. It'd be great to get the Bitcoin Core GUI to the point where more people would be willing to use it, but, practically speaking, having the backend code be solid for Bitcoin service providers makes more practical sense right now. That's not to say they haven't been working on the GUI. It's coming along, too.

Businesses like Coinbase don't require the Bitcoin Core GUI to implement such features, they use the backend, which already *does* have SegWit address generation support. Core prioritized the backend implementation first, so that businesses like Coinbase could then go and implement it. Every Bitcoin wallet that already exists, including Bitcoin Core, is capable of *sending* to a SegWit address, no update necessary.

Yeah, you've stated before your very conservative block size perspective, and that you'd personally rather not have SegWit addresses used, but is this the perspective of many of the other Core devs? 
I agree with you that SegWit addresses enable a block size increase and not a real gain in efficiency, but I think in the short term, getting the big players to use it will help reduce fees, motivating fewer people to opt toward using less secure coins that have lower quality devs such as BCH, and help to motivate businesses that make their money on volume to stick to devoting their limited dev resources to Bitcoin rather than devoting it to implementing some other altcoin. 
In the long term I don't think this will hurt your emphasis on decentralization to any significant degree. I just think that getting the bigger players to use SegWit addresses until we have Lightning and other scaling solutions implemented is a good compromise to work towards right now, rather than have Bitcoin industry support continue to fragment and degrade.

Here's an example for you. I've been trying to sign up with Gemini, but I use FreedomPop as my cell phone service provider. FreedomPop makes use of the data network of Sprint for both voice and data, and then provides their customers the option (for slightly more per month) to use some older AT&amp;T voice bands when out of range of the data network. This combination works out to just $18.98 per month for my cell phone bill, much better than other phone packages. FreedomPop assigns their customers a number from a range of VoIP numbers, and then provides SMS over their app only (so you can't use a third party SMS app like Signal, but I'm okay with that). 
However, because my number is from such a VoIP range, Gemini detects my number as not being a standard cell phone number, and won't let me get past the Authy 2FA step of the account sign up process. Because of this, I can't even get to where I might extract the Authy key to do what you're saying above. I contacted them about it, but they told me that they can't make an exception, for compliance and security reasons. Keep in mind that every other cryptocurrency service that I use allows Google Authenticator. I wouldn't have a problem with Gemini forcing people to use 2FA, but forcing it to be tied to a standard U.S. cell phone number for the purposes of Authy shouldn't be the only option to be able to maintain full security and compliance.

Outside of possible insider trading, they did damage to their customers by releasing it as a surprise announcement, giving people no ability to plan ahead on the price action of any of the coins listed. People made panicked trades due to the laggy interface conditions and the flash crash on the other three coins, where they wouldn't have if they'd known in advance. There should have been a prior announcement of the date and time, and more preparation by GDAX so that the interface would be able to handle the increased volume. GDAX/Coinbase says they pride themselves on doing things in a conservative and secure fashion, and this definitely wasn't that. They just don't seem to respect their customers.
If this were some outside event that caused things, it'd be different, but, in this case, the conditions were caused by the exchange itself choosing to do a surprise coin addition immediately onto their exchange instead of responsibly handling things to make sure they caused the least amount of surprise market impact for their customers as they could.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:44:10
The Bitcoin Core client *does* natively support SegWit address generation *right now*, it's just not implemented in the GUI.  Why? Well, one of the main reasons why the Core devs focused on implementing it first in the backend was *because* Bitcoin services like Coinbase actually don't use the Bitcoin Core GUI to implement their services, they use the backend, so the backend needed to be done first. Actually, the GUI in Core has almost *always* lagged behind getting the backend right first. It's never tried to be the first out the gate for ease of use or most feature rich from a UI standpoint.
Also keep in mind that we'd likely already have it in the GUI by now if the Core devs hadn't had to re-prioritize some safety measures prior to the 2x hard fork. It was supposed to have gone in on 0.15.1, but was delayed until at least 0.15.2 for this reason.
I think the pull request for the GUI implementation happened recently, so it shouldn't be much longer.

@_date: 2018-01-14 20:48:14
Speaking of libraries/backends, I suspect Coinbase will, unfortunately, wait until after Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 is released, just to spite the Core devs, even though they don't need it to be released to implement it, given the above (and other exchange examples). :(

There was this thing, but I don't think it was fitwear:
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:27:26
I have my opinions about BCH, but that's not my main concern here. It's not good business by a financial exchange to have people go by just hints or rumors. That just isn't a responsible or professional way for a financial exchange to do business by. It's fine to tell people it might happen in five months, but once it's actually ready, you still let people know of the date and time so that people can prepare and so that it doesn't adversely affect the other markets that you already offer.
Coinbase simply doesn't seem to be learning from their mistakes, like that ETH flash crash where they refunded people. That was good of them, but that doesn't make what happened yesterday not a mistake. It was all their own doing, and simply irresponsible on their part. I don't understand people defending them for this when it goes against any responsible financial exchanges procedures to handle it the way they did.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:53:21
Yeah, I'm referring to the whole site locking up making it harder for enough people to set limit orders to maintain liquidity, and then the whole thing flash crashed and anyone placing market orders got rekt.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:13:54
I think you're referring to this: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:05:47
No, the interface was definitely an issue, it was lagging and overloaded while the price was dropping on the other three coins, causing people to panic. This caused low liquidity on the order book of the other coins, and people got rekt on any market orders if they sold, directly caused by the exchange not being prepared ahead of time for the volume, and by them creating an unnecessary rush to the exchange before they had the capacity to handle the volume. This idea that any lead time would have led the same effect is false, because people would've gone into it with a more prepared mentality and the order books would've had more liquidity ready. Pissed off customers who don't want to be surprised by a major change by their financial exchange is *also* bad for business. There's clearly a lack of respect for customers here.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:42:46

@_date: 2017-12-13 22:18:42
You guys must be referring to this sort of situation: 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:51:19
That's fine if you don't like people critical of them adding BCH, but if they are growing at a high rate, it's even more of a reason for them to be conservative about rolling out a new product in a rushed manner without warning when their platform has already shown itself to be unable to handle high volume on the coins they already support. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:21:06
lol, of course, I'm not complaining about the fact that there were leaks/rumors, those happen, and I'm not complaining that savvy investors are going to have some sort of edge, they always will, what I'm saying is that a financial exchange shouldn't be leaving the notification of new product releases up to leaks/rumors, they should be setting a specific date and time so that people can prepare ahead of time. Even a week's notice, while a very short timeframe in the financial world, would have been better than this. And this is not about me being mad for missing out on something, I wasn't even looking to buy or sell BCH, it's about its impact on the total market and the users of their platform being impacted, even those who didn't care about buying or selling BCH. It also substantially impacted the other coins on their platform.
Simply put, no legitimate, real world financial exchange does surprise releases of new financial products/instruments. I don't even understand how this is an argument.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:54:31
No doubt I'll be doing so, but it doesn't mean that they didn't harm anyone by botching things in the way that they did. This idea that "the free market works and it is by far the most effective and ethical way to distribute wealth to the ones that deserve it, voluntarily" misses the point that having laws against fraud and other wrongdoing is not a bad thing. Laws can work to protect people so that the ones who do the right thing *do* attain the most wealth. Companies that manipulate things and do insider trading and the like can very well run off with people's money if there wasn't any law against that, and they wouldn't "deserve it" just because they succeeded in gaining that money in a free market.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:55:46
Not all regulations are bad, but there doesn't even have to be regulations for Coinbase to still set the date and time for releases.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:58:38
Even if no direct fraud is found, responsible financial exchanges shouldn't be doing surprise releases of new assets directly onto their platform with no specific date and time announced, especially when it's obvious that their platform can't handle the coins they already have at high volume. Exchanges shouldn't be surprising people, they should be announcing changes ahead of time so that their customers can prepare. Government bailing people out is one thing, but respecting your customers and doing what's responsible as a business is yet another. They talk about being conservative with their changes because they say they value security and stability, well, this wasn't that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:32:02
Right, we need more quality exchanges for one.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:42:13
No, it's not enough. Any responsible financial exchange would inform their customers of the specific date and time it was to go live so that people could prepare for it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:27:59
No, it still matters. Some ways of managing high traffic are better than others.

Please feel free to contribute to the Core code (even the GUI code) if you're a capable dev. Unlike Coinbase who can pay for talent, Bitcoin Core is still able to benefit from having more quality devs contribute.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:19:13
Yep, and when it's finally ready, they should still announce to their customers the specific date and time so that people can prepare, not saying you don't agree. Exchanges shouldn't be in the business of creating surprise events like they did.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:29:15
That's why having other exchanges and brokers is key. Hopefully this will cause more business to flow to some of the alternatives.

First off, I don't know that we should jump to any conclusions about someone getting to Cobra. 
As far as the argument he's making, he seems to be assuming that first layer transactions would only be made by banks, but I don't know if it would be the same as today's banks, and having settlement only by large entities isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as the censorship resistant properties are still there. If Lightning Network nodes became these so called "banks", but they weren't, by way of the underlying technology, easily able to censor transactions in any practical way, then it wouldn't necessarily be the same thing. Banks don't have to be all bad.

@_date: 2017-12-21 03:47:45
Oh, come on; it's not that at all. No responsible financial exchange in the world does a surprise release of new products like that, for good reasons. Them saying that it would happen at some point before 2018 doesn't solve the problems that they created yesterday at all. Yes, people knew it would happen at some point, but that's separate from it being necessary for a responsible financial exchange to announce their new products with a specific date and time once those products are ready, giving their customers and the market a chance to prepare.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:09:21

@_date: 2017-12-20 20:03:50
Yep, exchanges should be trying to avoid creating surprise conditions for their customers and markets, regardless of which coin it is, and *especially* if their interface already can't handle the volume. Like the OP said, GDAX talks about prioritizing stability and security, but then they go and do the opposite by generating panic conditions for their customers that could be totally avoided by not dropping surprise announcements live on their trading interface. It's not just about the BCH, people also were impacted by the flash crash and laggy interface that it created on all their other trading pairs.

The responsible move would've been to announce the date and time in advance and prepare their interface for the additional volume, not do a surprise announcement, playing with people's emotions, combined with a lagging interface that can't handle the "surprise" volume, causing panic conditions with the coins they already support.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:02:08
Sure, what I'm saying is that a responsible exchange shouldn't be in the business of creating surprise events on their platform, full stop, but especially when you do that combined with having a trading interface that still can't handle the volume of users that they're getting. We already have enough outside factors causing market events in this space, we don't need exchanges creating even more issues for their customers all by themselves by not letting people know about the date and time of new additions in advance. Exchanges should be making conservative decisions for stability and security reasons, just like they notify people specifically when there will be scheduled maintenance on the platform. Not doing so is probably still legal, but that doesn't mean it's what's best for everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:31:06
And that all the customer volume caused major lag and a flash crash on the other trading pairs, too, showing they weren't prepared, and gave no one else time to prepare, either.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:42:19
Stopping trading after the fact doesn't make up for the problems they created for their customers by releasing it as a surprise announcement with no ability for them to plan ahead. There should have been a prior announcement of the date and time, and more preparation by GDAX so that the interface would be able to handle the increased volume. Doesn't GDAX/Coinbase say they pride themselves on doing things in a conservative and secure fashion? 
A number of their customers probably panicked and lost money on market orders when the other three coins listed there quickly dropped in price, with the laggy interface conditions playing into people's emotions. If the cause of this were some outside event, it'd be different, but, in this case, the conditions were caused by the exchange itself creating a surprise event instead of doing things conservatively and responsibly.

Yep, on the contrary, the Core devs have been quite trustworthy in their conservative approach to maintaining the code and protecting Bitcoin's unique strengths.

You're forgetting the problems they created for their other customers by releasing it as a surprise announcement with no ability for them to plan ahead on any of the other coins listed, not just BCH. There should have been a prior announcement of the date and time, and more preparation by GDAX so that the interface would be able to handle the increased volume, and that consistent liquidity would be there ahead of time.

It's not just about BCH. Don't forget the problems they created for all of their other customers by releasing it as a surprise announcement, giving them no ability for anyone (but insiders) to plan ahead on price action on any of the other coins listed, not just BCH. There should have been a prior announcement of the date and time, and more preparation by GDAX so that the interface would be able to handle the increased volume, and such that consistent liquidity would be there ahead of time. 
GDAX/Coinbase says they pride themselves on doing things in a conservative and secure fashion, and this definitely wasn't that. The laggy interface conditions and flash crash on the other three coins was also directly caused by the unprofessional way that they handled this. They don't respect their customers. If this were some outside event that caused things, it'd be different, but, in this case, the chaotic conditions were caused by the exchange *itself* choosing to do a surprise coin addition immediately onto their exchange instead of handling things conservatively and responsibly as any exchange should.

Not to mention GDAX's lack of preparation for the customer volume when *they* had over five months to prepare.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:19:13
This situation?: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:16:53


That's fine, people are free to do that, but it's not like Coinbase and GDAX, who are supposed to be about stability and security, have to create surprise events on their own system. They would still get theirs in fees once they finally debuted it, and would also maintain the respect of their customers by giving them time to prepare. This idea is just false that an early Coinbase announcement would make no difference. Doing things to generate good customer psychology and allowing people to be prepared ahead of time so that they don't panic makes a big difference. It's just the responsible thing to do. Their interface currently hasn't even been able to handle high volume external events on the three coins they already have, let alone a surprise launch of another coin of their own making. We already have enough volatility and panics in this industry to also have exchanges creating these events themselves. If they're going to talk about stability and security, then they shouldn't be creating surprise events when there are obviously better ways to handle things.
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:41:01
You're right that it's a misnomer, and I don't think you've really said anything that deserves getting voted down. However, it definitely shouldn't become the standard naming convention. The Bitcoin currency's name is simply not the same as any one of its node software implementations. The Bitcoin currency is called the bitcoin or BTC, and has \*multiple\* node software implementations or clients, including Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots, Bitcoinj, etc. "Bitcoin Core" is simply not the name of the currency.

That's technically true, but it's still the responsible and professional thing to do for any exchange to let people know the specific date and time once it *is* finally ready. An exchange should be trying their best to not make any surprise announcements, especially when their interface can't handle the volume, as it exposes their customers to unnecessary adverse conditions that could be avoided.

If they're going to talk about stability and security, then they shouldn't be creating surprise events when there are better ways to handle things.

In the meantime, would it not be reasonable to do something like the following? Take Coinbase at their word, that they currently don't have the devs to be able to implement SegWit deposit addresses (whether or not that's actually true), and offer to have some of the Core devs advise them (and other exchanges) on implementing it? It would come across as a good faith gesture, showing people that the Core devs want to be good stewards of Bitcoin and want to help get the issue resolved. Like I said, it wouldn't have to be an offer to just Coinbase, but to any exchange struggling to implement it. Just trying to think outside the box here. I mean, they say that perception is reality. We know that it can't be that difficult to add SegWit deposit address support, but that doesn't change the current reality that we currently have centralized entities like Coinbase inefficiently using the block space, which is impacting the practical use of Bitcoin for everyone, not just for themselves.

In terms of your after-tax calculations, in Euro terms, yes, it can be considered fixed, as you simply pay a lump sum in taxes each year, a proportion of which goes towards maintaining the financial system, and then you receive, in return, an unlimited number of "free" transactions.
Obviously, with a progressive income tax, the richer you are, the higher lump sum each year you pay to maintain that infrastructure. 
Everyone also pays for it as a sort of opportunity cost over the long term, in terms of whatever percentage of their Euro holdings (or Euro-denominated earnings) have devalued over time due to inflation, which goes towards paying off the debts of the governments that maintain the system. 
Mind you, because your bank transfer system is centralized, it is also going to be cheaper than maintaining a decentralized system. :)

No, I'd argue that OB won't offer anything special in such a scenario. If you project to have any real consumer traffic browsing your store, and this is assuming a "world economic collapse" doesn't significantly harm people's Internet connectivity, you'll realize that you'll need to trust a company to run your OB store on their servers, as your home Internet connection won't cut it. 
OB isn't going to magically generate robust supply chains and best pricing for the world population if the "world economy collapses". Sure, people might use bitcoins to transact in such scenarios where their nation's currency is no good, but OB would need not have anything to do with that.

That's what I'm saying, though. It should be much higher now per transaction, given that we have many more transactions now, unless people truly value their BTC transactions that much less compared to back then, or we've got a lot more free riders that don't value the service that the miners provide to them. Not mutually exclusive, of course, and there may be other reasons.


No, I still think it's fair. On a per transaction basis, there's not necessarily a reason to suspect that just because the value of an *overall* bitcoin was worth more, that the random fractions of BTC that people were moving around then were somehow valued more by them. If anything, you'd think they'd have more of a reason to not pay a transaction fee back then, if there was a good chance that it would still be included.
Sure, maybe there's some sort of irrational exuberance at play here, but when someone is transacting $5 worth of bitcoins today, I don't think they are thinking, "Man, as a percentage of the $5 worth of bitcoins that I'm sending, I'm now less willing to pay a certain dollar-valued transaction fee than I did in 2013."
We'd probably have to look at the median transaction fee paid back then, in USD terms, compared to that being paid today to explore this in more depth.

It's a fair point about the psychology surrounding Mt. Gox, but your point doesn't seem to have any bearing on whether to measure in USD or BTC. It comes across to me as a non sequitur. Can you elaborate?


It really depends on what the platform is built upon. Does the service provided to us by miners cost them anything? Is there a limited resource involved? It shouldn't boggle your mind that fees might rise if demand increases, and access to a resource has or technically requires limits placed on it to preserve that resource.

I think your priorities are mixed up. It's *your* blanket statements that are the problematic ones, such as "the people invited to the event are working hard to make the world a better place", and "there are better targets to make fun of than these people".
*How do you know* that the people invited to the event are working hard to make the world a better place? What is *your* proof of it? And, who *are* the better targets to make fun of? What is your proof? 
From my perspective, the default position in Bitcoin should *not* be to assume that everyone is doing good, but to be skeptical. When's the last time you put yourself on the line by being the unpopular guy in the room who actually asks the hard questions? Junseth has done this many times. In Bitcoin, believing that people are here to make the world a better place is a great position to take... if you want to get scammed.
The default position should be to ask hard questions of those who are wanting to sell you something. For whatever reason, many Bitcoiners would prefer to get scammed. They don't want to hear any hard, skeptical questions. They think it's being impolite. It makes them feel uncomfortable.
And the scammers love this. They just *love* it when they're treated politely by you, and especially once you hand them some of your bitcoins. Then, once they've exited with those bitcoins, you'll be provided with the very kind of *proof* that you're asking for.
Junseth operates differently. While you may not like his style, he's very good at spotting scams (and their enablers), often ahead of time (when it matters), and he's  good at calling people out on their bullshit. He's a human scam detector. He's got a very good track record of this. If you want to know who he thinks are the scammers that attended the event and what his proof of this is, ask him. You may not like his answers now, but you'll probably thank him later.

Talking about the price of one BTC in USD reaching "parity" with one ounce of gold in USD is absurd, because comparing these two units of measure is a completely arbitrary comparison. 
For instance, one bitcoin is currently worth about *31 times* the value of one *gram* of gold, but no one is talking about that, for obvious reasons. 
Possibly the total market cap of each market might be compared, but comparing the prices of each at unrelated units means nothing.

"This feature is intended to save peak block bandwidth for nodes, reducing bandwidth spikes which can degrade end-user internet experience. However, the centralization pressures of mining exist in a large part due to latency of block propagation, as described in the following video. Compact blocks version 1 is not primarily designed to solve that problem.
It is expected that miners will continue to use the Fast Relay Network until a lower-latency or more robust solution is developed. However improvements to the base p2p protocol will increase robustness in the case of FRN failure, and perhaps reduce the advantage of private relay networks, making them not worthwhile to run.
Furthermore, the experiments conducted and data collected using the first version of compact blocks will inform the design of the future improvements we expect to be more competitive with the FRN."

What I believe is that the best minds in this space have concluded that the primary layer of Bitcoin is best suited for providing immutability and censorship resistance through its decentralized nature, and that maintaining and expanding that decentralized nature, which is a limited resource, is paramount.
I think this idea of the said portion of the world, whose daily pay is less than a dollar, needing to use, and actually participating in, frequent on-chain, first layer, immutable transactions is a pipe dream, one that even 8 MB blocks would not be large enough to handle, and one that would necessitate further centralization, especially at this current point in time, given the current technological constraints required to run nodes sufficiently at that capacity.
*Of course* that set of people that you're referencing couldn't afford to run a node if they couldn't even afford to make an on chain transaction currently, but that still doesn't take away from the fact that we should be prioritizing things like the performance improvements of 0.14.0 (on top of the needed SegWit from 0.13.1), which make it *less* expensive to run a node, while enabling the possibility for 2nd layer solutions like the Lightning Network that the individuals you've referenced could more likely use at a lower cost per transaction. It's absurd to think that going into the near future that we should expect frequent, immutable, on-chain transactions at a very low fee to be sustainable. The universe doesn't owe us that. There are real costs involved.

It's fine if we have a fundamental disagreement, but it seems like you're playing semantics, unless you can tell me why your framing is more useful or descriptive.
I would contend that \*both\* capitalism and socialism are economic systems with distinguishing features, and most governments/states implement something that is not purely one or the other, but take on qualities of each.
To better understand where you're coming from, let me ask you this: What counts, to you, as a socialist system? Can a socialist system, in practice, integrate capitalist ideas? If it can, then at what threshold do you differentiate between a socialist system with capitalist ideas and a capitalist system with socialist ideas? If a socialist system can't integrate capitalist ideas, then how do we properly describe real world examples of ideas that come from socialist thought that are integrated into a capitalist system, or ideas that come from capitalist thought that are integrated into a socialist system?

No doubt it has the theoretical capability to do whatever you want it to do, but that's simply *not* what I'm talking about. I don't misunderstand Turing completeness, you misunderstand the problems involved with introducing Turing completeness into a blockchain-based system.
The smarter route that I'm talking about isn't referring to the theoretical capabilities of code that's unimpeded by resource constraints, it has to do with the smarter management of the real-world, limited resources and incentive structures that are involved with maintaining a successful blockchain-based system; that is, one which *doesn't* allow Turing complete code to be run on it being smarter than one that does. 
I'm talking about the smart design of a blockchain-based system, not the theoretical smartness of a system capable of running Turing complete code.

Where do you imagine that ends up, in terms of the level of decentralization of the mining and the amount of hash power securing the network?


It does, because it sets the value of the base block reward. If the base block reward is low in real world terms, or has mostly been mined, then you have to make up for it in fees.

In my mind, they might want to find out who it is, so that they have more options to be able to damage Bitcoin if they ever feel the need to do so.

It wouldn't technically destroy Bitcoin, but it'd be one additional tool that they'd be able to make use of.

Yep, divide and conquer. Playing both sides. It's very short-sighted, but the people doing these attacks likely don't care.

Correct, but I'm not talking about that. What I'm talking about is if you use LTC as your medium to transfer value to Poloniex to buy, say, XMR, your BTC cost basis for tax purposes is not impacted. If you're doing FIFO reporting, you can leave your BTC holdings untouched for the long term, and not calculate capital gains and losses on them until you sell.

I see what you're saying, and I'm probably missing something, but it seems suspect to call something a soft fork when "legacy" nodes' blocks would deliberately be getting orphaned by the newer nodes' software rules. This would, be definition, require more than just a modification to all nodes' signalling code to have them remain in consensus.  Maybe I'm having a brain fart, but my understanding is that with SegWit, "legacy" format blocks are still fully supported, so you don't get forked off for forming and propagating such blocks. No new consensus code other than just *signalling* for SegWit needs to be run -- you don't have to run any further SegWit relevant code, you just have to flip a signalling bit.
With what you are proposing, unless other code than just the signalling code is modified, previous nodes could reach a point where *their* chain would have found and added blocks more quickly, becoming the longest chain to them, as they would be able to mine blocks faster on the EDA, and they would *even* be able to do so with a technical *minority* of the hashing power, given the EDA. 
I guess my questions for you would be: How are you defining the majority, and based on what difference would newer nodes know to orphan blocks produced by legacy nodes?

If some rogue NSA agent/analyst could take advantage of such a theoretical vulnerability and not get caught, it would be interesting to see the effects of that.

, Bittrex is stretching this thing out by requiring 20 confirmations on BCH deposits, but it looks like my short term theory was right -- as soon as it was announced that people could deposit BCH, the price dropped significantly.

Nothing, I just happened to come across your comment and thought I'd mention it. 
You said, "there are plenty of people who identify as "democratic socialist" who do align themselves with Che and Marx."
Well, I've heard people making the distinction enough times to understand that there's a sought out difference there, even if a lot of people don't realize it. It's also not something that is 100% agreed upon by everybody, of course. I can completely agree that there are plenty of people out there who don't know the differences in their own beliefs in *all kinds* of areas. This wouldn't be the first. 
If you're interested in more depth on the distinction, check out the sources next to the following on Wikipedia:
 
"The term "democratic socialism" is sometimes used synonymously with "socialism", but the adjective "democratic" is sometimes used to distinguish democratic socialists from Marxist–Leninist-inspired socialism which is viewed as being non-democratic in practice.[4][5] Democratic socialists oppose the Stalinist political system and Soviet economic model, rejecting the authoritarian form of governance and highly centralized command economy that took form in the Soviet Union in the early 20th century.[6]

Bittrex has re-enabled BTC withdrawals, so now people seem to have a way to sell their virtual BCH tokens that mirror whatever BTC that they had left on the exchange *and* withdraw that value as BTC. If there's no caveat to this, then we should now see some further pent up interests come into play on the price. 
You could be right that the current price is the closest guess to what it will turn out to be, but, given the general advice that was going around, telling people to pull their coins off of exchanges, I get the impression that there are now many more people interested in depositing back into exchanges their BCH to sell than there are waiting to buy at "their favorite exchange". If you really want to speculate on BCH, you can go ahead and buy it right now, even if you can't withdraw it. Why wait until people can deposit and withdraw it before buying some... unless you think the price will drop at that point. :P

Word to the wise -- always try depositing a small amount to an exchange *and* go ahead and actually try to trade it before depositing significant amounts, because it seems that they'll gladly accept your funds, but will give you no indication that they have trading disabled on your account until right at the worst time -- when you're executing a trade. :(

There are a number of omissions in the Bitcoin Core GUI. The Core devs are aware of this, and know there are more user friendly wallets out there. If anyone supported getting SegWit capabilities in the GUI sooner rather than later, though, it would be who is one of the Core devs that strongly supports people using a full node as their Bitcoin wallet. If he's not pushing to getting SegWit transaction capabilities added to the Bitcoin Core GUI soon, maybe he can suggest another full node implementation that *will* be supporting them sooner?

If BTC withdrawals are back up, that would make things interesting. Bittrex, for instance, has re-enabled BTC deposits and withdrawals. I get the impression that all the people that had their BTC sitting on Kraken and Bittrex before the fork can now sell their virtual BCH tokens that were split from their pre-fork BTC holdings... and *now* withdraw that value as BTC. I suspect that the price will adjust accordingly, *before* anyone else can get their outside BCH in.
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:12:23
Thanks for the explanation. What isn't clear to me based on your explanation is what would happen to the miners still following the EDA, mining blocks with an easier difficulty. If it's backwards compatible, it would seem to be the case that those blocks would *also* still have to be accepted, meaning that it would continue to be more profitable to mine on the EDA, not go with the majority of miners choosing to ignore the EDA rule. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:55:30
I did think certain miners might want BCH to remain viable, to have as a fall back option and use as a sort of leverage or negotiating tool for the upcoming SegWit2x hard fork debate. But maybe Bitmain doesn't, themselves, want to take on that opportunity cost, just hoping that others might. Or, like someone said in the twitter thread, they're trying to have the difficulty gamed down first. You'd think that BCH wouldn't be over 100 blocks behind BTC at this point if Bitmain really wanted to hedge things by keeping BCH viable, but gaming this first difficulty adjustment may be critical, too.

My statement wasn't wrong, because my point was leading in exactly that direction, that to have an at least "okay" situation, you have to have mining end up in such a way that it's sustainable *while* not being highly centralized or extremely easy to attack. I wasn't arguing against the idea that, yes, you can have an unreliable BCH network persist in a centralized and/or easy to attack manner. As long as no one attacks it, yes, of course, you can have it persist.


No, as the problem doesn't start there. The problem just gets worse as you approach that point.
Also, you said:


Look, fortunately, there's been a BCH dev within the last day or so already talking about a way to modify or remove the emergency difficulty adjustment, so we'll have to see how soon that happens -- but, no, it's not clear to me what point is actually moot, when we're talking about shortsighted, rushed decisions that people even said *ahead* of time were a bad idea and that actually haven't been fixed yet.
The fact that it might get fixed such that those long term, most problematic results aren't actually realized doesn't mean that it isn't a problem -- it's clearly a problem, and one that could have been avoided entirely. 
This is not to say that there aren't any problems with Bitcoin that I'm allowed to just wave away as being eventually fixed, and thus claim to be moot like you're doing -- no, the difference is that there are *fundamental* mistakes like this continuing to be made with Bitcoin fork initiatives that are total rookie moves. Somehow, while the fundamentals continue to get ignored with these initiatives, at every step of the way, you have these guys coming over here oblivious to any of that, supporting XT/Classic/Unlimited/Cash, and brushing aside all of their own fundamental, novice mistakes, thinking that, because they can play gotcha on technicalities with Bitcoin, that they somehow know better. This is why we can't have nice things.

Eleven years is a lot lower than 123 years, and, keep in mind that BCH supporters complain about high fees on Bitcoin, but you'll need to have higher fees on BCH sooner to sustain miners within just 11 years, unless the BCH price skyrockets.
@_date: 2016-11-02 16:44:04
Is that you :P
@_date: 2016-12-08 10:26:34
You can, but it takes more clicks, you have to do the math in BTC terms, and it leaves you holding the BTC yourself for however long it takes you to go to the final step of sending it out. Even if it takes only a few seconds, Coinbase still logs whatever small price change that happens as a capital gain or capital loss in your account, which, while we know are likely small values and only for your tax convenience, would be completely unnecessary figures to keep track of and clutter things up if it was simply handled the way Circle did it.
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:28:10
It's currently better for sending smaller transactions to save on fees until we get second layer solutions on Bitcoin. Mind you, now that the mempool spamming has stopped on Bitcoin, Litecoin doesn't have quite the advantage on fees that it had a few months ago, but it's still cheaper for now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:40:50


but you'll need to have higher fees on BCH sooner to sustain miners within just 11 years, unless the BCH price skyrockets.
lol, I definitely did say that, but you're just reading into it *one* literal interpretation, when I meant a different literal interpretation. :P :P 
Let me present it to you again, providing more explicit context for you, since you aren't willing to steelman anything I'm saying yourself: 
You'll need to have higher fees on BCH sooner [than Bitcoin does] to sustain miners [that is, to keep the less profitable miners from dropping out, as the faster halvenings arrive] within just 11 years, unless the BCH price skyrockets [which would also keep the base reward high enough such that the miners wouldn't have to drop out]. 


The price has nothing to do with the size of fees.
Your statement was false. Whatever else you think happened, did not.
Like I said, it does, because it sets the value of the base block reward. If the base block reward is low in real world terms, or has mostly been mined, then you have to make up for it in fees [or else less profitable miners will drop out, which brings us back to the previous point that I reiterated for you in more explicit terms].


If that is the case, then why would a BCH dev want to remove it?  Anyway, if new evidence shows that leaving it in wouldn't cause substantial inflation and faster halvenings over the long term, all things equal, then I would happily cede to you my argument regarding the long term hypothetical problems, and still be able to stand behind other arguments stating that it's been a bad, disruptive decision in the short term. It could've been handled in a less disruptive way, and you still could've had your fork (as stupid as *that* is for other reasons).


I just re-read it, and I explicitly said, for example: "If the base block reward is low in real world terms, or has mostly been mined, then you have to make up for it in fees."
Key words there are *low* and *mostly*. These are relative terms. You're introducing unnecessary conditions to this discussion. There's nothing important to what I'm saying that magically changes once *all* base coins are mined. 
The emission schedule in this context is asymptotic. We all know that the lower and lower the base block reward gets, as more and more of it has been mined, the more you'll have to make up for it in fees, or else you will sacrifice miners. The faster the inflation rate, the sooner that happens. 


No, it definitely is a bug, because there are better ways that it could've been handled from the get go, and there are better ways that it can be done going forward. You're also *assuming* that the oscillatory behavior is already damping itself out, which is fine for you to argue, but it could just as well pick up again, given the gameability of the EDA.


Having very long block times and then very short block times, and having an unpredictable emission schedule, are not positive things when there are better alternatives.

Circle had the ability to instantly send USD value from a debit card to a BTC address. It's my understanding that with Coinbase's fiat wallet feature, you still have to deposit USD first, which is an extra step.

It would have more utilization if more services hadn't needed to devote resources to supporting all of these unnecessary forks. If these services don't implement support for SegWit addresses now, *they* will be the ones stalling.


Bitcoin is still usable, but if I want to do small value transactions right now for lower fees during times when the mempool size is high, I don't mind using Litecoin for that.

You can use Litecoin for that. There was no need for a fork when there was already a broadly accepted alternative -- Litecoin. It's absurd that Ryan X.

He wouldn't have even needed to use SegWit transactions on Litecoin if he really didn't want to, and Litecoin already has broader support, but, nope, he had to go with something that more directly spites Bitcoin.

Are you saying that adding support for all of these forks hasn't cost services development time and money? Since you're acting as if you know what you're talking about, do you know of a way that adding SegWit deposit addresses would cause an exchange's system to be compromised? Yes, services always need to put time into testing *any* change, but is there anything special about SegWit addresses technically that you feel is an impossible mission for them to implement? Don't just spread FUD, give specifics if you know what you're talking about. Also consider the fact that other wallets and services *have* already implemented SegWit addresses, so it must not be an impossible, security destoying mission.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:13:12
My understanding is that you could have a Lightning Network without SegWit, but you still would want a solution to transaction malleability, and SegWit does the best combination of solving transaction malleability and achieving other goals.

Right, it's something like the Dunning–Kruger effect.

@_date: 2017-11-09 20:44:58


I think I did misread part of what you said there. First of all, let me say that I'm personally not a fan of OpenBazaar's ecommerce concept. I think it's trying to do something that's largely unnecessary. That said, does it really need to be tied to one particular coin in the first place? If you really want to use just Bitcoin for it, there are different things you can do. You can find ways to help other industry players move toward using SegWit addresses, you can contribute to Bitcoin Core in various ways to help move other scaling optimizations forward in terms of implementation or testing, etc. There's not one answer.  


If they choose an alternative that has a good balance of similarity to Bitcoin (SegWit is already on both), and something that already has broad acceptance (LTC has fiat on-ramps), once Bitcoin *does* have lower fees again, it won't be difficult to switch back. But choosing one or the other for ecommerce seems to be a false dichotomy; there are a number of services that make it easy to accept any number of alternatives. Can you be more specific about why you think short term ecommerce applicability should be getting more emphasis from Core right now? Is this problem actually more specific to *OpenBazaar's* vision of ecommerce?
Anyway, my perspective has been that Bitcoin shouldn't try to solve all problems for everyone in the short term. Hard decisions about what gets done first have had to be made.
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:46:29


Services don't use the GUI, and it's already available in the backend, which is the area where Core was focused on getting it done *given this very fact that services don't use the GUI*.


Don't ask me -- it's what the services are using as an excuse. And as for Bitcoin Core development, you must not follow it very closely, because hardening Bitcoin Core to prepare for the various hard forks has most definitely taken time away from other areas.

After the BCH fork, people were getting connected to Bitcoin nodes instead of BCH nodes. To avoid that kind of thing happening to Bitcoin after future forks, along with some other reasons as far as avoiding wasting network resources on an incompatible fork, the Core devs modified Bitcoin Core so that Bitcoin nodes would detect and disconnect from 2x nodes preemptively. Following that, my understanding is that 2x made additional changes to their code to circumvent this. Then Core followed up with further changes to deal with their circumvention of it. There was also some other work that was done in addition to this, but I've not had the chance to look at it in more depth.

Once your bitcoins are held in a SegWit address, the next time they are spent  they won't contribute as much to the overall block weight, so miners that include them can fit more into that block. This should make them cheaper relative to a non-SegWit transaction.

These are miners that were signaling for Bitcoin Unlimited's Emergent Consensus proposal. They were recently still signaling for it on the Bitcoin network, with about 30% of the Bitcoin hashrate. That just dropped to zero, which is interesting because up until this point they had still been signaling for it on Bitcoin, even with Bitcoin Cash around for them to mine, which uses a similar approach.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:47:44
If developers of wallets and exchanges hadn't had to spend most of their time of late supporting all of these forks, more of them could have already added SegWit receiving/deposit addresses, which would've already increased the capacity of each block even more than what we've had. Every time another fork happens, implementation of features we already have are getting delayed, just so that another unnecessary forked coin can be supported. And the people creating these forks don't have to do the actual work to get the new forked coins added to every wallet and exchange, so they don't care, and they won't take responsibility for their impact on delaying progress on Bitcoin itself.

@_date: 2017-04-27 00:42:18
The problem might be that there hasn't been anything disincentivizing such a situation in the way that Bitcoin works. If miners aren't incentivized to care enough to take action by way of, say, sourcing from various hardware makers, or if the hardware makers themselves dominate the hashrate by mining on their own hardware, what's stopping it from continuing? Indirectly, by way of the community calling out the miners, and the price dropping from fear of such a hack taking place, you may have some incentives there, I guess.

The thing is, if we do a SegWit soft fork now, and later on there is no progress in a reasonable time frame with the LN, or there are simply continued problems that come up with no better solution than raising the block size further, it would seem to me that big block supporters would be more than capable of threatening a hard fork again, with the likelihood at that point of *more* support from the rest of the community than they've so far had.
@_date: 2017-04-30 05:07:48
If they're not against SegWit, then it doesn't make sense to block SegWit for some sort of supposed fear of Core.  If SegWit + LN + further optimizations don't solve scaling along the way, and Core has nothing else to offer at some point in the future, *that* would be the time to protest, and they'd have more support then.

Not if things like Schnorr signature aggregation, side chains, and the Lightning Network keep being developed, implemented, and are successful. Ultimately, we may reach a point where all such optimizations aren't enough, when some or all of these may not be optimal when limited to soft forks, and, at that point, there will likely be a need to do a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-04-27 07:05:34


Well, I don't know how it might come across that way, as I've been following this debate for years. 


Who, Gavin? You seem to want to make it sound as if there weren't any good reasons for these individuals to be pushed out.


Besides the fact that the "Core team" is made up of many individuals, it, collectively, continues to do a great job, better than all the rest. Deciding "it's no longer about segwit", that is, essentially holding up progress regardless of what is presented on technical grounds, is not reasonable at all. If you can't trust the "Core team", then you definitely can't trust the BU team. Anyway, stating that there is a "loss of trust" is simply not a legitimate argument. It might be descriptive of how Jihan Wu and Co feels, but it's not a legitimate rationale. The SegWit soft fork code should stand alone and speak for itself, regardless of some arbitrary feelings regarding "Core team".

So, something like Gavin's code to cap signature operations and signature hashing would only keep such transactions from being operated on past the cap and then being included in the block, but it wouldn't be able to avoid any operations up to the cap?


That's an interesting point. I'd like to see someone provide further information on this.

When discussing Bitcoin nodes, "archival" usually refers to storing *everything* contained in the blockchain (instead of just the UTXO set), however, to simply spend your bitcoins, you just need to connect to a node that has a copy of the UTXO set, right? When you say "some archival tier of the network", you seem to be describing a future not where a person storing some *data* in the OP_RETURN might have difficulty accessing their data, but simply someone with a paper wallet having difficulty spending their bitcoins. Can you be more specific?
@_date: 2017-04-27 05:13:34
I agree that it isn't likely just one solution. Keep in mind that nullc said something about even looking at the code you might have missed the potential maliciousness in this, so even fully open source code can have bugs. But I don't think this was even completely open-source on the non-mining code, because there was some sort of hard coded variable involved that would block you from changing what it does.

With the Lightning Network, or other second layer solutions following SegWit's implementation, we will have both. It's not Core's fault that the science demonstrates that the first layer is better off if it is conservatively scaled, so as to maintain dencentralization, which, of course, is where the censorship resistance is derived from.

I'm sure this has been discussed elsewhere, but here it goes:
I'm just trying to imagine the circumstance where the data storage technology of the future would make it any more costly to access a Bitcoin UTXO from 50 years back versus a more recent one, given that data storage space is so cheap and continues to be improved. 
In a future where storage space is cheap, it might be no more costly to store the entire UTXO set on whatever data storage medium is being used than some subset of it.
As long as the medium that it is stored on is not significantly more costly to keep online than one with smaller capacity, it shouldn't matter whether it's a block from 10 minutes ago or from 50 years ago, as the amount of energy required to access it would be roughly the same.  
It makes me think of this: 
Correct me if I'm wrong: Is the UTXO set's growth rate supposed to outpace practical online drive storage capacity by some prohibitive amount in the next 50 years?

In the short term, we still have more adoption of SegWit addresses to come (first P2SH-wrapped, and then native SegWit in bech32) as well as having more services adopt batching. 
Next, there are various payment channel possibilities, which doesn't just include the more fully distributed LN option. Even if these sorts of solutions aren't the ultimate answers to life, the universe, and everything, they can, at least, provide *a lot* of optimization in various areas.
After that, there are still things like Schnorr signature aggregation combined with MAST (including Taproot and Graftroot) to further optimize things, and sidechains may open up another area of expansion.
If we put all of that together, and it still isn't enough, I don't doubt that further improvements will happen. At some point, a base blocksize increase as a hard fork with other improvements added could be done. I think there's still a lot of optimization to come.

You need to have the token of value to incentivize the proof of work which is what enables the trustless consensus of the blockchain to work.

Yeah, but this is not just any normal money transaction. When settling on chain with Bitcoin, you can't do a pull payment, you have to do a push.

My opinion has been that everyone can't magically just get their way with no work involved, and, unfortunately, these forks socialize the technical work involved in supporting each fork. To be sure, for users who think BCH is the better direction, they sure aren't showing this by way of transaction activity. I'm not saying that they should have no voice, but they don't seem to be the majority to me. As far as 2x is concerned, do you not mean SegWit2x? Because even with SegWit2x, SegWit transactions are supported, so it would make sense for exchanges and services to go ahead and add support for SegWit transactions now, as people will benefit now, and then they won't have to duplicate that part of the work later on for any successive fork.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:36:16
Xapo hasn't added support for SegWit receiving addresses, either, have they?

Have you seen this?
Roger Ver: "So, there's been lots and lots of internal politics and fighting within Bitcoin, but if you read the Bitcoin whitepaper itself, it clearly defines Bitcoin as a chain of digital signatures. The SegWit version of Bitcoin gets rid of those digital signatures, so by the very definition given in the Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, a SegWit Bitcoin transaction is not a Bitcoin transaction. So, from my point of view, Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin."

They've been up to 18% of the total, and we've had many larger than 1MB blocks, but what's holding it back is sites such as Blockchain.info, Coinbase/GDAX, ShapeShift, BitPay, Poloniex, Gemini, Bitfinex, and Purse.io still haven't added SegWit receiving/deposit address support. You'd think they'd all want to do it, if only just so that they, themselves, could save on transaction fees -- not to mention being able to sell their users/customers on the ability to save on transaction fees. Please contact any of these companies about adding SegWit addresses if you genuinely want to help solve the problem, as it's something that they can already do right now.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:26:59
It's much more likely to be Coinbase and Bitfinex, not because 0.16.0 was released.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:48:50
Right, for those entities that are genuinely working toward it, it's unfortunate that they've also been pressured to support Bitcoin Cash, when all of their technical effort could have just been applied to adding SegWit support.

Well, if they do spread it out, then part of the liquidation is going to happen around the time of the 2x hard fork, which has its plusses and minuses. Honestly, I'd prefer that they get it over with ahead of that, but I guess it couldn't hurt for them to be depressing the BCH price during the fork.

A trick has been to move the BTC to GDAX (which is within their system and free), and then you can withdraw it from there without a transaction fee.

It'd be good to know if they're actually in the midst of adding SegWit receiving address support, or if they haven't even started working on it yet. If they've been avoiding it for safety reasons, we know it's working great at this point, we just need more high volume Bitcoin service providers to add it:

It actually has helped, because we now have had blocks consistently larger than 1 MB. We're getting close to breaking a 1 MB average for the past 7 days: 
Anyway, if you genuinely want it to help achieve bigger blocks and lower fees *right now*, ask Coinbase, BitPay, and various mining pools to enable SegWit receiving addresses.
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:04:06
They said they'll e-mail each person when it's enabled.

Is ShapeShift planning on providing SegWit deposit addresses? It would seem practical to do so, as it would help to increase the block capacity now, helping to lower fees across the network, and no fork is necessary for this.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:06:56


There's no way to know where the peak will end up. The current drop is obviously because a bunch of coins stored in non-SegWit addresses moved due to the BGold fork situation.

Actually, if they implement it now, they won't have to re-implement it for SegWit2x, it'll already be largely done.

Unfortunately, sites such as Blockchain.info, Coinbase, ShapeShift, BitPay, Xapo, Poloniex, Gemini, Bitfinex, and Purse.io still haven't added it. You'd think they'd want to, even just so that they, themselves, could save on fees -- not to mention their users/customers.
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:51:28


Humans are so tribal.
Would you say that you're not tribal on this issue? For example, would you support Coinbase, BitPay, and ShapeShift adding support for SegWit receiving/deposit addresses, given that this functionality would help to increase the block capacity *now*, no further fork necessary, and would help to lower fees across the network? If you would support this, have you communicated this to them?
Some people have made the off-hand suggestion that it might difficult to implement, which would be fine, but then it'd be nice to just get an indication from them that they're even, genuinely, working on it. I know I haven't heard anything from them about them working on it, and we already know it's possible, given that the hardware wallet companies have already integrated it, and Electrum 3.0 will also have it soon, along with a few of the other software wallets that already have it.

Similarly, a number of NYA signers such as BitPay, Blockchain.info, Coinbase, Purse.io, and ShapeShift (and even NYA non-signers such as Poloniex, Gemini, and Bitfinex) haven't, to my knowledge, added SegWit receiving/deposit address support, which would help to increase the capacity of each block, and reduce fee pressure. You'd think they'd all want to do it, if only just so that they, themselves, could save on transaction fees -- not to mention being able to sell their users/customers on the ability to save on transaction fees, as well.

Various Core developers have said that they are not against ever having larger than 1MB blocksizes, nor have they collectively said that 1MB blocksizes are large enough for eternity. Keep in mind that with SegWit, which they developed, we *already* have larger than 1MB blocksizes. Also, the LN is not seen as the only future scaling solution. It's not "a savior", though it can do some great things.
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:03:18
So, they tell people to *not* deposit BCH to the addresses. That's not a reason to implement SegWit addresses. It would help their business to provide a service that saves them and their customers on fees.

It is supported, just not in the GUI. Most Bitcoin transactions are not made using the Bitcoin Core GUI.

I'd also like to see some of these companies/services, like Blockchain.info, Coinbase, ShapeShift, BitPay, Xapo, Poloniex, Gemini, Bitfinex, and Purse.io add SegWit receiving/deposit address support. It seems political at this point why they haven't added it, so I'd like to be proven wrong.

@_date: 2017-10-16 00:09:12
Yes, but what would be even better is if they added SegWit receiving addresses, which would help to help reduce the overall mempool and transaction fees across the network, regardless of what happens in the upcoming fork.
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:52:59
This has nothing to do with batching, which is independent of SegWit address usage. It's *very* likely to be Coinbase and Bitfinex adding SegWit deposit addresses, not 0.16.0.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:06:40


lol, and you believe him, as if they took a poll of all of their customers or something. No, your claim is, by definition, wrong, as *I've* been one of their customers, and *I* wanted SegWit, and I'm not the only one, so their customers *did* want SegWit, lol. 
At worst, some just didn't know how helpful it would be, as *unlike* Coinbase's devs who should understand the technical merits, we shouldn't expect their customers to understand all the technical aspects involved.


You're being disingenuous with "months". SegWit has been enabled on the network since August, not  just the *two* months that you're referring to ("two* being the minimum number of plural "months" that you can correctly, but disingenuously state as "months", if that's even when they actually started), and SegWit code was available and working on testnet for even *longer* than that if they needed to use it as a reference and test their implementation. No, SegWit receiving addresses should have already been implemented by them many "months" ago.


No they didn't. The necessary code to do SegWit address generation has already been available in the Bitcoin repository for much longer than two months. And, it's not as if Coinbase was having to reinvent the wheel here, so just give me a break. The only reason that full SegWit functionality wasn't completely checked in to the Core GUI as a release yet, and tied with a bow (which, mind you, isn't used by businesses' backends, anyway) was simply because the Core devs have had to focus on *more* than just GUI level wallet stuff, and had to re-direct their priorities to some other emergency items in the last few months. None of this should have impeded Coinbase's implementation, as can be seen with other exchanges, including Bitstamp, having already implemented it for "months".
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:04:46


Why haven't Coinbase and BitPay added SegWit receiving addresses, then?
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:52:37
I don't think it's going to take years to enable SegWit addresses on exchanges. How are you coming up with that long of a time frame? Keep in mind that the hardware wallet companies have already integrated it, and Electrum 3.0 will also have it soon, along with a few of the other software wallets that already have it. It'd even be nice just to get an indication from Coinbase, BitPay, ShapeShift, etc., that they're actually, genuinely, working on it, given that they, supposedly, want lower fees for everyone. It's already been on testnet for a while now, so you'd think they'd have come up with something, sought out help from the community if there's issues, etc.

Their ticker for BTC could eventually represent the price of B2X. Speaking of things they *aren't* doing, they haven't added support for SegWit addresses, which is unfortunate, given that this functionality would help to increase the block capacity now, no further fork necessary, and would help to lower fees across the network.

Then please contact sites such as Blockchain.info, Coinbase, ShapeShift, BitPay, Poloniex, Gemini, Bitfinex, and Purse.io, who still haven't added SegWit receiving/deposit address support. Having them implement it would help to increase the capacity of each block, and reduce fee pressure in the range that you're talking about. You'd think they'd all want to do it, if only just so that they, themselves, could save on transaction fees -- not to mention being able to sell their users/customers on the ability to save on transaction fees. Please contact them about adding it.
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:18:02
GDAX currently pays the transaction fees on withdrawals, so they would attain a higher profit margin by lowering transaction fees on the network.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:02:04
So, in other words, they actually didn't care about getting a block size increase in as soon as possible for their customers, and, instead, care more about politics. This is like cutting off the nose to spite the face.

It's definitely true that these things can hold sway on the direction of Bitcoin, in the sense that they can decide to sell the side of future forks that they don't like, and send their shareholders a distribution for that. GBTC shareholders are going to be voting soon to enable the Trust to provide distributions from profits received due to forks. This follows the announcement earlier this year that those who held shares prior to the BCH fork would be getting a distribution of some kind to represent that value.

Hopefully this will change somewhat with their SegWit implementation. It's crazy how quickly median fees jumped back up to over $2 in the last day, even though we obviously don't have to pay that much to get into a block: 
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:24:38


The absurd thing about this is that you have some miners currently not including SegWit transactions right now, even though it would increase the amount of transactions they could get per block, because it actually increases the block size. You also have exchanges and services that were supportive of the NYA that haven't implemented the use of SegWit addresses yet, even though it would lower the fees for them and their users and would use more block size.
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:06:47
Another example is SegWit address support. It would help a lot with fees *right now* if sites such as Blockchain.info, Coinbase, ShapeShift, BitPay, Xapo, Poloniex, Gemini, Bitfinex, and Purse.io added SegWit receiving/deposit address support. You'd think they'd want to, themselves, save on fees.

Frogolocalypse , I tend to agree with you on a number of things, but it's the *accumulated* hash power/difficulty that people are talking about, which BCH isn't even close to having. I'm with you on the question of how they would calculate it with two different algorithms, though. They'd have to compare them by converting them both to the estimated amount of accumulated energy burned, which still doesn't matter if a person considers hash power only a determining factor among *valid* chains. I saw it quoted the other day where even Satoshi said something like you could have another cryptocurrency that burns more energy, and it still wouldn't have the name Bitcoin. (trying to find the link now) Also, another example, when Ethereum moves to proof of stake, how will it be possible for them to know which chain is still Ethereum? :P @_date: 2017-10-25 20:41:16

Yep, unfortunately, sites such as Blockchain.info, Coinbase, ShapeShift, BitPay, Xapo, Poloniex, Gemini, Bitfinex, and Purse.io still haven't added SegWit receiving/deposit address support.

I don't know which wallets, exchanges, and other services use the Bitcoin Core daemon's wallet functionality directly in their backend, but I suspect they weren't all waiting idle-handed for 0.16.0 to drop, and then just plugged it in. It's possible that some were testing integration behind the scenes as 0.16.0 got closer to release, and then flipped the switch right as 0.16.0 was tagged, but, more likely, we haven't seen those instances come into play quite yet.

No. it's a valid concern, as the option to use a secret ballot in the United States is still widely available for those who need to use it. As far as being able to verify how you voted without others knowing how you voted, that means that you can also choose to verify it *for others*, if they are buying your vote. Do you doubt that absentee ballots allow for more votes being bought than if it were only secret ballot?

Here's a direct quote, and the full video:
"So, there's been lots and lots of internal politics and fighting within Bitcoin, but if you read the Bitcoin whitepaper itself, it clearly defines Bitcoin as a chain of digital signatures. The SegWit version of Bitcoin gets rid of those digital signatures, so by the very definition given in the Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, a SegWit Bitcoin transaction is not a Bitcoin transaction. So, from my point of view, Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:53:09


Their spare time views seem to be relevant, because the Bitcoin service that they offer hasn't even added the option of using SegWit receiving addresses yet, which would help to increase the block size *now*, which would help to lower fees across the network, no fork necessary.

I can read sarcasm in what you wrote, but, yeah, we have people arguing that we must somehow stick to the exact letter and word of Satoshi's "vision" based only on the original whitepaper (regardless of any new evidence that comes into play), but these same people aren't arguing that we shouldn't change any of Satoshi's original intentions that we might surmise from his original *code* or other statements. Things like an asymmetric emergency difficulty adjustment, for instance, were not in Satoshi's original code, because they can be gamed to screw with the emission schedule (the inflation rate). I'm fine with not assuming that Satoshi was some sort of oracle, but if we're going to try to consider what his perspective was, at least try to weigh all the evidence.

It's true that not all nodes need to be fast block propagators, but it would be preferable that more can be, because it would make the network more robust in the sense of decentralization, which is what we want to promote. Given that mining is a core component of Bitcoin, and the miners are currently relying on the Fast Relay Network, which is centralized, this makes the FRN and similar centralized solutions a potential target. The idea is that this sort of centralization pressure needs to be disincentivized as much as possible. If the Bitcoin protocol itself had a more capable, decentralized method of providing what the miners need, there wouldn't be such the incentive for them to make use of the FRN. I don't know if a decentralized system can ever propagate blocks as fast as a centralized system, but we should be shooting for that as a goal. Currently, Core has been moving in that direction by implementing Compact Blocks, looking for further ways to enhance propagation, staying conservative with any block size increases, and making way for secure transactions to scale off-chain like the Lightning Network.

The thing is, a lot of the stuff being claimed to have been done by the Core devs or Blockstream or Bitcoin supporters has actually been done by BCH supporters. I don't have the time to re-hash this all out at the moment, but I do have an opinion on one other thing mentioned: "In our story, Core claims Segwit has fixed the block size debate when it is really the transaction volume that has dropped."
Except, we already have had larger than 1MB blocks for the four months prior to the recent drop off in activity (which has happened across the board, no just with Bitcoin), and those four months happened even without certain major transactional entities such as Coinbase having implemented SegWit addresses or doing batching yet. This means that the next time we have a spike in transactions, there most definitely will be more capacity available. Furthermore, this isn't something that by itself "fixed the block size debate", that's a strawman, as no one reasonable claims that further optimizations aren't needed.

@_date: 2016-10-30 14:33:15
Just because you are capable of keeping your copy of the blockchain up to date on that machine is not the same as your setup being capable of making a significant contribution to block propagation. Raising the blocksize causes even fewer nodes on the network to be able to propagate blocks fast enough for mining purposes. Even the addition of Compact Blocks, even at the current 1 MB, still doesn't get the decentralized protocol to the point where it can sufficiently compete with the latency and throughput of the centralized Fast Relay Network, but at least it gets us closer.
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:52:53


That's not all we care about. Though getting SegWit by itself would be great, this isn't just SegWit, it also increases the blocksize further, is from an untested dev team, and, like you said, doesn't seem to pay attention to any of the technical details.

There are good arguments for having the primary (settlement) layer function like digital gold, and then build the digital cash layer (e.g. LN) on top of that.

Thanks for the links. Looking through that, the tl;dr is that you've got to use txindex=1, reindex the blockchain, and then run the ElectrumX server using Python 3.6, alongside your full node. This means that you'll be running your own Electrum server. I'd taken your original post to mean that Electrum could somehow connect to a full node directly now, without running an Electrum server. 
Anyway, since I use Electrum from time to time, I might as well take the time to get this set up, that way I'll have a trustless setup even with my Electrum wallets.

Speaking in the context of ASICBoost, I saw Thomas Zander sent a e-mail yesterday to the dev mailing list stating, "Miners have agreed to the SegWit part of this compromise."
Since, like you said, there's been no detailed specification for this proposed compromise, is it not reasonable to question whether he's necessarily accurate in making synonymous the miners agreeing to SegWit with the miners agreeing to block ASICBoost?
P.S. I also noticed in Section 8, point 2 of Jeremy Rubin's paper on ASICBOOST such an interpretation being presented:

It's essentially a sybil attack on UASF, and was inevitable. Any potentially legitimate UASF node growth is now dwarfed by this. At least this is obvious, whereas a better attack might've been to try to spin up sybil attack nodes more gradually, with their locations better concealed, to make it look as if UASF was legitimately gaining, and then shutting them down right before August 1st.

Right, but what's not clear to me is that on this, after the SegWit soft fork, people are saying that there's still the possibility of users going against the 2MB HF.

As for now, some of the Core team still seem in pushing for the low prio SegWit stuff, even though a structural block size fix would give us SegWit and a reunited community in the progress.
I don't know why you believe SegWit to be low priority based on engineering principles, so you'd have to explain that further, but given that it provides a block size increase along with fixing other issues, it's not clear to me why you'd be against letting it go through, given that having it *also* doesn't block future additions/features. Also, can you specifically define what you mean by a structural solution?


What is impossible, increasing the maximum number of transactions without increasing the block size? No, we know that's possible. As far as what people are advocating, Core is advocating exactly that, and then raising the block size in the future as we hit the limits of other scaling enhancements.

Right, I'm pretty sure I completely agree with you on that. I'd argue that the measure of immutability is on a spectrum, and that Bitcoin's approach to immutability, due to its "consensus through PoW" and "permissions layer", makes it have *stronger* immutability, or, say, it more closely approaches "true" immutability on the asymptote, than what we had seen before. You might say its level of immutability puts it in a brand new category. The persistent data structures of the past simply couldn't approach this level of immutability.

""Bitcoins don't care what people want" bitcoins are not a conscious entity and they don't get to care or not care."
No, but bitcoins have certain properties that impact how they will be utilized and priced in the market. The way Bitcoin works is not completely arbitrary or up to the whims of its users just declaring it to be a certain way.  For instance, the core devs aren't going to just go and increase the total amount of bitcoins in the future. There are simply certain properties of Bitcoin that are, for all intents and purposes, fixed.


First of all, not all bitcoiners want it "to be a currency and not a commodity". I happen to be just fine with it behaving as a digital commodity and not maintaining a stable price as a currency. 
I'm very skeptical that some set of bitcoiners can just decide that bitcoins are going to act as a stable currency and this will just magically be the case.
The way I see it, the price of the bitcoin is ultimately based on what the market is willing to pay for the utility that each bitcoin provides. This may simply not be a stable value. 
Bitcoin's utility is derived from its fundamental qualities, which include its deflationary reward schedule, as well as the immutability and censorship resistance capabilities of its blockchain. It enables regulatory arbitrage. If such properties aren't conducive to maintaining a stable price in the world marketplace, then it simply won't be stable and useful as a unit of account, whether you like it or not.

Another theory to add (not my own) is that the miners' actions are somehow a way for them to generate the most money in the short term, but are in a way that may ultimately cost them users in the long term, and will, thus, come back to bite them. 
It could also be the other way around, though, that their actions are a way for them to generate the most money in the long term, but are in a way that may cost them users in the short term.

I wonder if Jihan and his cohorts have ever owned a surplus of ASICs, enough that turning them on would have put them at greater than 50% of the Bitcoin hash rate. If they were ever hesitant to run them, lest Bitcoin be seen as *actively* under a 51% attack, then there would have been no other use for them. Now, they'll have something else to direct those toward. The thing is, I guess they've long been able to just direct surplus ASICs' hash power at other mining pools, so, either way, it'll be interesting to see what happens to the Bitcoin hash rate soon.
Edit: lol, I guess they could also always just *sell* any surplus ASICs that they have. :P

Regarding the question of what can be given to the other side, it's pretty unfortunate that, though we've reached a point where the top Core developers' long insistence on doing SegWit as a soft fork, and doing it ahead of a hard fork, may end up succeeding in practice, their stance on this issue may end up having them cede something substantial to the other side; that is, ceding their de facto role as the most influential, most meticulous developers of Bitcoin's consensus rules to teams of less experienced developers. If that happens, I hope we can somehow arrive at a way for the top Core developers' experience and development practices to be passed along. I hope they aren't shunned by the other side, or find themselves driven to walk away. We need them to stay around, continuing to facilitate good testing and development practices, conveying their knowledge and understanding of how the system works to others, if they end up losing their de facto role.

In my mind, his support for SegWit2x is superficial. No doubt that he's publicly acting as if Bitcoin Cash is an altcoin. He's hedging his bets by publicly saying one thing, while keeping his options open privately.
We know that he delayed SegWit as long as he could (which was until the UASF came along). Then, as an out, he went along with SegWit2x to delay just a little bit longer (instead of just signalling for BIP141). SegWit2x allowed him to superficially *act* as if he was willing to compromise, *and* it left open a possibility for him to attain more power over development of Bitcoin if the SegWit2x hard fork *does* ultimately become popular. 
Behind the scenes, though, he was working on getting BitcoinABC pushed forward. By *publicly* saying that it isn't him looking to go ahead with the Bitcoin Cash hard fork on August 1st, it provides him with cover. He can continue to publicly act as if he supports SegWit2x, while privately still pulling strings to help BitcoinABC/Bitcoin Cash gain steam. It leaves options open to him.

Even if you believe that this is essentially banking, with censorship capabilities, it's not a bad thing to enable potentially more trustless ways of doing things that approach the things that we see in banking, when compared to just storing funds on exchanges to act as a Bitcoin bank for you to enable certain off-chain functionality, versus the flip side of that where you would have to do everything on chain. This opens up some in-between capabilities to conserve blockchain space.

Not if they didn't believe in your inflexible perspective on social agreements needing to necessarily trump any new discoveries.


You know that this wasn't about Core not wanting to solve any of that. This was about a subset of miners that wanted more control over the direction of the project (for various reasons), with this subset of miners being too stubborn to not give the Core developers the benefit of the doubt, and, instead, manufacturing a scandal over it. If these miners had, instead, gone along with SegWit in good faith, and then, down the road, they still saw no longer term scaling solutions making any progress to deal with the aforementioned problems, these miners would've had much more community support behind a hard fork at that point in time. Instead, they decided to start this long, drawn out process of tit-for-tat, superficial bullshit. All they had to do back then was just take a step back and say, "We have our doubts about SegWit, but we're going to give it a shot and see where it takes us." Instead, we've had this ridiculous campaign of propaganda and insincerity arise.


Keep in mind that the idea of avoiding a hard fork as much as possible has not been deemed as blasphemous here -- we may well be able to scale a good deal more without a hard fork -- but no, it would really depend on the circumstances. I'm sure that if all Core scaling proposals weren't moving along as previously thought, that in less than two years from now a conservative hard fork would be considered. By that point, there could be a number of reasons to do one, and we'd have solid data on a number of the alternatives by then.

It depends on what you want to call a full node. We can already prune the blockchain in various ways, but pruned nodes can't, by themselves, seed from scratch new, fully validating nodes.

This idea of Jihan feeling betrayed by Core having not followed artificially set deadlines is a joke to anyone who understands software development.


This is false. Core did have it as part of its roadmap, and they have also said that they will support future hard forks if necessary. In software development, however, when issues are found and/or better ways to go about things are discovered, roadmaps can change. Your idea of software roadmaps being some sort of inflexible, immutable contract that must be adhered to *or else* is not a practical perspective.

Hmm, that seems to be a different level of immutability than what Bitcoin provides. The kind of immutability mentioned there seems more akin to a constant variable in a program, where the programmer could still go into the source code and change the value if he wanted to, or shut the whole thing down if he didn't want it to exist anymore.
With Bitcoin, the information on the blockchain is stored immutably in more of a "real world" manner, as even the core devs can't just go in and change it, or shut it down if they don't like it.

I don't believe that Wright is Satoshi, but people may find the following from the LRB piece relevant:


Weeks later, I was in the kitchen of the house Wright was renting in London drinking tea with him when I noticed a book on the worktop called Visions of Virtue in Tokugawa Japan. I'd done some mugging up by then and was keen to nail the name thing.
'So that's where you say you got the Nakamoto part?' I asked. 'From the 18th-century iconoclast who criticised all the beliefs of his time?'
'What about Satoshi?'
'It means “ash”,' he said. 'The philosophy of Nakamoto is the neutral central path in trade. Our current system needs to be burned down and remade. That is what cryptocurrency does – it is the phoenix …'
'So satoshi is the ash from which the phoenix …'
'Yes. And Ash is also the name of a silly Pokémon character. The guy with Pikachu.' Wright smiled. 'In Japan the name of Ash is Satoshi,' he said.
'So, basically, you named the father of bitcoin after Pikachu's chum?'
'Yes,' he said. 'That'll annoy the buggery out of a few people.' This was something he often said, as if annoying people was an art.

"They" was just referring to anyone using a method to distinguish between the two, and I was asking how "they" are doing this.


That's what I'd like to know more about, if that, in fact, is the case.
In my mind, spoofing can be a disinformation method used by people opposing the thing they are spoofing with wild node counts, to try to show that it actually doesn't mean anything, in contrast with the ideal case, which would be where all actors did act truthfully (which, of course, we can never assume).


In my mind, up until the point where the best, bug free version of the proposed upgrade is available, "spoofing" the latter type of these nodes (not the uacomment) with the node software with the most trusted *current* code, for the purposes of signalling intent isn't malicious, at least.

I don't disagree with that. I'm not saying we should cater to the *lowest* common denominator. Yes, the "9600 baud HAM radio links" option would be absurd.
I also don't disagree with your data center distribution argument. The important thing to look at in this regard is what the real world figures on data centers have been as far as contributing nodes to the network over the course of time, on how that has trended, and on what optimizations can be made to incentivize maintaining what we have, if not growing it.
Mind you, regardless of where the data centers situation stands, an important issue which remained to prioritize was getting optimizations like Compact Blocks in there sooner rather than later such that we could get away from the centralization of bluematt's relay network.
By our not immediately prioritizing a blocksize increase, the Core devs have been able to use the opportunity of having blocks be essentially at capacity over the short term to collect data on how the fee situation actually behaves in the real world, which has not been the end of the world as Mike Hearn predicted, and this will help the devs make science-based decisions for the long term.

Right, but it's just when they *expected* it to be released. It's simply taken longer, due to fixes and thorough review. They merged it into the master ten days ago, so it's been getting final reviews. Peter Todd recently pointed out some issues with it. I think the following may also be holding it up: 
At the same time, unrelated to SegWit, the Bitcoin 0.13.0 RC cycle is supposed to begin on Wednesday last I checked, and there has already been a code freeze on new features for a while now on that release, so I suspect that even more attention will be directed toward finalizing SegWit soon. My understanding is that SegWit will be applied to both 0.12.2 and 0.13.1, not too long after 0.13.0 is released.

Sure, but it would demonstrate that he is actually *in control* of the key, which would rule out the idea that he just came into possession of the Sartre document pre-signed by the real holder of the key.

Interestingly, according the the LRB essay, it was MacGregor's assistant that went and got the new laptop when Gavin believed that it needed to be done on a fresh machine, so it wasn't, as some have believed, an assistant of Wright's who could've tampered with it (unless MacGregor and the assistant were also in on it): 
"So we waited a bit while an assistant went to a computer shop and got a brand-new laptop.’ The idea had been MacGregor’s. He said the tension in the room was unbelievably high. Wright was refusing to do the one thing that would guarantee the success of his mission. He hadn’t seen it coming, but Andresen wouldn’t blindly trust Wright’s hardware, and Wright wouldn’t blindly trust Andresen’s. The solution had to be a fresh computer straight out of the box. MacGregor called his assistant and gave her the task. ‘This is how you get your One,’ he said to her. (In his company the best score you could get in a staff appraisal was a One.) It was just before 6 p.m. on a Friday night and they needed a brand-new laptop in Covent Garden. The assistant got hold of one and rushed over from Oxford Circus to the hotel."

Right, the users matter, but not all equally; that is, this is not a democracy. What matters to the miners is the market value of the new bitcoins and fees that they are rewarded, and how any actions that they take might affect that value. So, the users that would matter the most in that equation are the ones that most sustain the current demand for bitcoins, which keeps the price where it is, not just any user voting in some poll, or any vocal support on the matter from a Bitcoin business. My question is, in what ways can we objectively measure ahead of time that a certain change will actually increase the market value of the block reward?

That would be great, but we can't expect that people will choose to do that, or follow advice like "don't be a dick".
Tangential to this, I've been saying that if the miners that were blocking BIP141 had just, in good faith, gone ahead and activated it within the last year, and then *later* felt the need to push for a further block weight increase and/or hard fork, they could have actually gotten *ahead* of all of this and attained more support *then* from the overall community. They'd have been able to say, "See, we told you so." Unfortunately, they did not do that, because, like you said, we cannot wish for people to be "nice", or take one for the team. We cannot *expect* people to work together. :(
Basically, either people will  be *economically* incentivized to work together for the good of Bitcoin or they won't be. Either Bitcoin's economic incentive structures will work sufficiently, or they won't. I guess we'll find out.

"No one from Core will even discuss why they don't relieve pressure by raising the block size limit first, and release SegWit when it's good and ready and everyone agrees it's the right solution for the issues at hand."
Actually they will and they have discussed why, and *not* everyone agrees that a hard fork first to raise the basic limit is the right solution.
Two explanations from one of the Core contributors, luke-jr: 
You assume that there's an urgent need to raise it, but there isn't.  Mike Hearn was wrong about the following: 
"In fact, if Core were to raise the block size limit first, it would go a long way towards addressing criticism that they are in the pocket of Blockstream."
No it wouldn't. The critics would claim that the Chinese miners forced Core's hand or something of the sort.

I'd say that there are, practically, levels of immutability, though, just like there are levels of anonymity. Nothing is 100% immutable, just like nothing is 100% anonymous. Data stored in the UTXO set is more likely to approach 100% immutability the more blocks that are subsequently mined. However, Bitcoin could theoretically die, and people could start to delete copies of the blockchain. Someone could always be left holding a copy of it somewhere on Earth, but then an asteroid could hit that person's computer. :)

You really must not have read what they've written. I can't do that for you. I'm sure that they get tired of repeating themselves and have to get actual work done. If they had unlimited time, they could write a manual on the topic, with charts and explanations customized just for you, giving them the ability to say, "chinawat, RTFM!" Until then, you've got to dig down into the dev chats, mailing lists, github, and reddit discussions.


It's not a simple yes or no question. I personally don't think it should be out of the question to reduce it, but I'm not as adamant about doing it as he is. Other solutions which improve upon the network's decentralization may be enough. You have to look at the numbers, and you also have to have experience working with the numbers. They have that. The Core devs have looked at the numbers more than you, and more than me. I can only re-iterate these things up to a certain point of competency.


To focus our limited, competent developer resources on the most important issues. To make sure a more important variable doesn't get harmed by modifying another less important one.


Yes, given that miners currently rely upon a centralized relaying network. Developing solutions to move us away from needing it is more important than increasing the block size limit, in my opinion. The Core devs have analyzed various solutions for this, and they've moved forward on what they think is best. 


False. That simply doesn't make logical sense, given the variables.


There are probably diminishing returns at some point, but we're nowhere near that yet. As it stands, critical parts of the network are *not* decentralized. There isn't just one quantity of decentralization here. It actually depends on which parts you're talking about. For instance, losing some ideal decentralization in terms of node counts is fine, as I could cut off my Bitcoin node today, and it wouldn't hurt anything, because I currently can't run a high capacity node with the setup that I have, anyway. As optimizations are made, that may change.


Like I said, it depends on which parts you're talking about. Where we are now is badly centralized in the aspect already described.


I referred to what *he* wrote. The Core devs and others have laid this stuff out in many posts. I'm not here to rewrite what's already been written by others. The answers are out there. Do your homework.


I don't have an explicit citation on these resources, but the evidence is out there to look at, and I can tell you that core devs have posted about it in the past on various mediums. What you've interpreted as having caused no disasters is not the same as having no vulnerability. We've moved from the ground up over the course of Bitcoin's growth, from very small blocks to where we are now. There existed, in the beginning, idle network resources in terms of the average real world networking throughput/latency that Bitcoin could benefit from, until the needs of the network eventually surpassed this, as blocks grew and mining intensified. To put it a different way, at the beginning, more nodes were capable of contributing substantially compared to now, because the resource requirements were simply less.


That chart means nothing in isolation. There are other variables.


Based on what evidence? I can play this game, too. Btw, you don't need to show me your evidence, show it to the Core devs. They're the ones doing the best science here.


Democratic votes are not scientific. Would you suggest putting to a vote the best variables for building a bridge, or would you ask the experts? You talk about idealized perfection being bad, but then you want some sort of community vote that's other than what the aggregate of economic incentives is actually, currently voting for.

That's how they keep the value stable in the short to medium term, as they can control the supply. No one suggests holding fiat over the long term is smart. If you just want to beat inflation, you can hold TIPS. 
In my mind, there's still a valid place for fiat, bitcoins just provide a useful value storage alternative over the long term, as a sort of digital commodity.

You seem to be using circular logic. You said earlier that gold has a "fundamental" price, due to its production cost and its non-speculative demand, but now you're saying that the causality goes the other way, that it's worth what people will pay for it.


There *are* technical differences between Bitcoin and any altcoin, but there are also economic differences. Bitcoin has the first mover advantage, a much larger market share and mind share, more infrastructure and companies behind it, and greater intellectual capital behind it than any altcoin. Obviously, all of this could change, but that doesn't mean it will.

Is it necessarily a contradiction to like what gives Bitcoin its censorship resistant, regulation arbitraging properties *when applied to certain things*, but also be in support of trying to regulate its use in areas *where avoiding the regulations makes running scams easier*? I mean, it's clearly the case that once you have actual names attached to something, like many of these ICOs, that just because the Bitcoin (or Ethereum) system can't easily be shut down, means nothing in terms of protecting ICO scam creators from being put in jail. 
Just because bitcoins can be used by scammers (or even terrorists) doesn't necessitate that we should be against bitcoin, but it *also* doesn't necessitate that we should be against trying to stop scammers (or terrorists) that use bitcoin. Chris knows that the SEC can't stop Bitcoin, but he also knows that they very well could stop a number of these ICO scams.

Probably BAT, but it's still early on to claim this with 100% certainty. What's important is that not doing anything about potential scams until they become clear to be actual scams after the fact is a mistake.
First of all, there are numerous ICOs with token valuations above and beyond anything that would be reasonable for the type of future products and services being proposed, especially when the value of the capital being raised is essentially all up front with no strings attached. The incentive structures are just all wrong here.
The people putting forth these ICOs can even have great intentions, and that won't matter if the incentives aren't right. Most of these ICO CEOs will, by nature of the incentives involved, ultimately walk away before they've created anything that matches the value of the funds that they were supposed to be stewards of, given the belief here that there should be no mechanism to stop them other than maybe harming their public reputations. Time and time again, these incentives have acted in such a way that these people conveniently find a way to engineer their exits to minimize the harm to their public image, while still not actually taking the project to anywhere near what was promised. 
Furthermore, the people speculating on this stuff don't even seem to think that any of that matters, as long as they can sell their token to the next greater fool for a higher price than what they paid. 


By stating it this way, you seem to be wanting to just brush aside the reality that scams have *always* been a real thing in this space due to the incentives involved, and you're wanting to assume that ICOs have some sort of magical properties that couldn't possibly make them any different (or worse) than what we've already seen here.
Enabling people to be paid fully up front for future efforts, in a system where they aren't even supposed to be held liable to complete these efforts, isn't enabling some all hallowed new source of innovation -- it's enabling scammers to run rampant. These people can just take the tokens and run. And if you remove the public facing component and try to do this process anonymously so that the CEOs themselves can't even be taken to court because no one knows who they are, that'd be even more ridiculous, but at least more people might not be *so* stupid as to send their funds off to some anonymous person, unless there were some other mechanism to keep that person on task. (Keep in mind that with services on the dark web, for example, at least there's a concrete product or service being purchased, and some semblance of a review system and escrow that is involved, and even then you can still be scammed if they just decide they've profited enough personally and it's time to exit.)

You would hope so, and that would have to end up being represented in the stock price, which would be interesting. I've never gotten the full scoop on who could actually redeem their shares for the underlying bitcoins. My understanding at some point was that it was possible, but I'm not clear on how that process works. 
An extra complication that may or may not matter is how the shares were created. Accredited investors were the only ones who could originally buy in, and they had to hold their shares for a year before they could sell those to non-accredited investors on the OTC market (pink sheets). How and whether those accredited investors, and/or the non-accredited ones, could decide to trade their shares in for the actual bitcoins backing it up is what I want clarified. Also keep in mind that there's currently a very large premium on GBTC shares versus the underlying BTC price. If only Barry Silbert were here to answer investor questions on Reddit! :P

Weeks later, I was in the kitchen of the house Wright was renting in London drinking tea with him when I noticed a book on the worktop called Visions of Virtue in Tokugawa Japan. I'd done some mugging up by then and was keen to nail the name thing.
'So that's where you say you got the Nakamoto part?' I asked. 'From the 18th-century iconoclast who criticised all the beliefs of his time?'
'What about Satoshi?'
'It means “ash”,' he said. 'The philosophy of Nakamoto is the neutral central path in trade. Our current system needs to be burned down and remade. That is what cryptocurrency does – it is the phoenix …'
'So satoshi is the ash from which the phoenix …'
'Yes. And Ash is also the name of a silly Pokémon character. The guy with Pikachu.' Wright smiled. 'In Japan the name of Ash is Satoshi,' he said.
'So, basically, you named the father of bitcoin after Pikachu's chum?'
'Yes,' he said. 'That'll annoy the buggery out of a few people.' This was something he often said, as if annoying people was an art.

Your laptop hardware from 2008 being able to keep up with downloading the blockchain is not the issue.

It's often more about your Internet connection than your hardware (unless your hardware is outdated), but your laptop, or other machines (more generally) which don't have quite as capable connections, could be better contributors to the network once optimizations like what the Core devs are working on are made. That's the point. We want more machines to be capable of contributing in as robust a manner as possible, such that the network has more redundancy and doesn't develop centralized points of failure -- that is, to be relegated only to locations with the most expensive hardware like data centers. It's always going to be true that data centers will have more resources than a home Internet connection, but things like Compact Blocks can help to shorten the divide.

Yep, if a price drop happens now, it hurts all miners, including Jihan, but if that happens, and it's combined with Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin in market cap and volume, it might spur more miners to signal for SegWit.

I don't see total annihilation happening, but it could definitely impact the ETH price, given that demand for ICOs has contributed to the price run up.

@_date: 2016-07-04 23:34:28


I agree with his position that we need to prioritize decentralization over bigger blocks, and that we should do it in a well thought out way, backed by hard evidence.


It wasn't optimal yesterday. Did you even read what he wrote?


It's simply because there was some slack in the average real world networking throughput/latency that could be benefited from. That slack is gone. Compact blocks will help this, but there are multiple concerns.


I won't admit it, because it's not true. If we want to build up a network that offers protocol level miner and node decentralization capabilities that are actually robust, then the universe doesn't owe you a network with zero fees, even now. The block reward subsidy is doing just great, for miners who use centralized relaying and are skipping validation, but that's not what we should be striving for.
The protocol, as it stands, already isn't helping to make or incentivize the running of effective, fully validating nodes less costly. Just because you can run a fully validating node at your home in a first world country and be caught up with the latest block *still* does not mean that you're running a robust and effective node that's fulfilling the kind of redundancy in upstream throughput and latency that we should be shooting for. Increasing the block size limit right now moves us even further away from that goal, until other things are done.

I'm not one to say that they haven't been pressured. One difference, though, is that at least more people in Bitcoin seem to care about centralization pressures.

I sympathize with this, but I still think that if it turns out in the future, when looking back, that increasing the Bitcoin blocksize and getting SegWit added in were simply too contentious due to various circumstances, that these circumstances won't necessarily have demonstrated a fatal flaw in all cryptocurrencies. 
Keep in mind that such a Bitcoin will still have the benefit of less blockchain bloat by way of having not achieved a further block size increase, and this could end up being a feature, not a bug, as anyone will still be able to run a full node.  As other chains inevitably become bloated and take on higher transaction fees, while having to combat their own free rider problems, people may realize that it was actually a feature, not a bug, to not have a geometrically or exponentially increasing blockchain size, and could come back to Bitcoin. 
It may also be that, say, Monero, with its dynamic scaling and anonymity features, could take the lead, or even Litecoin, given that it was able to lock in SegWit before things became too contentious; and then Monero or Litecoin could gain more miner support and become a lot more secure and successful before they ultimately become too difficult to have changes made to them.

Of course it can't be proven that nothing bad will ever happen to Bitcoin, but it must be pointed out that the economic incentives behind Bitcoin *are* different than those of Ethereum. 
For example, one argument for the Ethereum rollback has been that once Ethereum goes PoS, they simply couldn't allow having that many Ether tokens in the hands of the attacker. This decision to transition to PoS has been decidedly part of Ethereum's roadmap. It's already being planned for in the code, for instance, in the way that the mining difficulty will increase, and their community is all for it. Having this be the direction of the project clearly is a motivating factor on its community to act in a certain way. 
Bitcoin isn't susceptible to this particular economic incentives flaw. Might Bitcoin eventually become susceptible to some flaw of its own economic incentives structure? Possibly. Many things are possible. But I don't think comparing it to Ethereum will help us uncover such possibilities.

This part isn't completely accurate. The moderate increase *of SegWit* was thought to be safe enough, as a sort of trade-off, given the malleability fix that it provides and the second layer capabilities that having the malleability fix will make easier to implement.

Something I saw elsewhere: "If Bitmain decides to hard fork (and takes their hashing power with them), and BIP148 activates with ~40% of the network's hashing power, the legacy chain (non segwit chain) will more than likely be reorged onto the BIP148 chain. This is because BIP148 is a soft fork."

Bitcoin could use some competition. Maybe all the miners (running ASICs which can only mine Bitcoin) that are not signalling for SegWit  will become motivated to finally signal it, lest they continue to lose potential money on where the price would be with SegWit.

You're assuming that the reason it takes six days on the ACH system is a technological problem. It's not. It's a regulatory problem. Banks already have the technology to do faster transactions, they just don't do it currently for non-technological reasons. Also keep in mind that the banks don't want to deal with a company that controls a massive amount of XRP. If the banks like the underlying Ripple technology for some reason, they'll just create their own BankChainRipple network, no different than what Stellar has done.

@_date: 2017-06-21 18:09:46


To assume this perspective, in and of itself, is to favor large mining cartels to a certain extent, because large mining cartels are more capable of maintaining for themselves a faster, more exclusive, centralized block propagation system such as a Fast Relay Network. Systems such as an FRN are also more prone to being attacked, given the more centralized nature that such a system depends on. Mind you, it may be inevitable that we have large mining cartels choosing to use a faster, more centralized block propagation method to gain yet another edge on smaller, more independent mining outfits, but when designing a system that depends on its decentralized nature, it's important to try to counteract such centralization pressures, and targets for attack, as much as is reasonably possible.

An argument against this is that the total value of your prior BTC holdings post fork will become the combined value of the coins that you now hold on *both* sides of the fork. As long as there's a market for both, the combined value could still end up being higher than what you had before.

I suspect that the reorg risk can be dealt with in SegWit2x, given that it is a hard fork. There's no need for all this other nonsense and changes that Bitmain has decided to tack on with their "UAHF".
Edit: Wait, if the hard fork part doesn't happen for six months, then I'm wrong about that. However, they could just propose a hardfork where everything else that was agreed upon for SegWit2x happens immediately as a hard fork, instead of the wholesale changes they're threatening with. But then we get back to circumstances where there isn't going to be enough time to test that properly, and it'd be best for everyone to just go with what is already supported by most of the nodes as a soft fork, and then hard fork at a later date. :(

"Despite this agreement, the UASF (BIP148) astroturfing movement continues to get lots of airtime on censored forums, many of which are controlled by single anonymous individuals. Many of the software developers who work in a software project called “Bitcoin Core” are also supporting it. BIP148 poses a significant risk for the Bitcoin ecosystem, so we are preparing a contingency plan to protect the economic activity on the Bitcoin blockchain from this threat."
Specifically (emphasis mine): "who work in *a* software project called "Bitcoin Core"", as if people haven't heard of the original, and predominant, Bitcoin client software project. Yep, just *a* project.

None of that fits the parameters of the Bitcoin blockchain, at least on the first layer.

This isn't necessarily the case: 
Also, he may have decided that he's going to lose in the end, and is now only choosing the options that will take the longest to roll out. In other words, he may support 2MB+SegWit as a delay tactic, not because he likes it, but because it's the best of the worst options for him, instead of just signalling for SegWit now, which he can do at any time.

Porting the EVM to Bitcoin has already been worked on in the past on Counterparty, so it's not like it's a new concept, and my understanding is that it's going to be done on a sidechain with Rootstock.

There are other blockchain projects doing something similar, not to mention Ethereum Classic, which is a cheaper solution than ETH at the moment.

The universe doesn't owe anyone the ability to settle microtransactions trustlessly, with censorship resistance, on the first layer of a blockchain, that everyone else must then store in perpetuity, and have it subsidized by others, until the end of time. Second layer solutions may get us there, but this is still an experiment. Maybe the universe doesn't owe it to us on second layer solutions, either. Until we get there, there's nothing wrong with free riding on Litecoin's blockchain if you really need to pay for your coffee with a transaction record that will forever exist.
