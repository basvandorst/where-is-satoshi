These look like block hashes. The first one is Block 
They are not private keys.

Nice to see mainstream media setting the record straight. It pains me when they associate Bitcoin with funding terrorists. Just sloppy reporting and playing to the audience's prejudices.

Not a single person here who listened to Gun on Andreas's show or ever heard him speak will make that mistake. 
I'm talking about Paul fucking Storcz. The idiot who could not pull off Truthcoin even though the Core devs gave him a freaking blueprint.

Yeah, Cornell professor versus an abrasive dude with an econ degree who is still trying to figure out sidechains and is pushing a shitty altcoin. I'll take the former.

So, failed academic with an econ degree from a second tier school, shit-talking first-tier computer scientists? Got it.

Weird. You sound jealous that he's not spending his time on your pet project, in a thread where he actually spent his time on your pet project.

Geez, you're making me question my choice of username now. I don't wanna be in grad school for life! Not all usernames are true! Are they?

Is this where we gloat, because he is educated and made a mistake in his analysis, and we're all low-life trolls who gloat at other people's mistakes?
WTF is wrong with you all? The guy made an error. Everyone who has traded cryptos has made a bad call. Are you all so uneducated that this random adjunct professor making a bad call is so important to you?
Get this shit off of the front page, it makes us look like lunatics.

You don't get the concept of "profit." Or "accounting."

Lots of people deserve my ridicule, but giving it to them makes me look smaller, so I don't engage in that kind of juvenile behavior.
I suggest you do the same. I suggest you all grow the fuck up.

So what?

You don't have profits until you sell. Did you sell? No? You have no profit.
I have some coins, but I don't pretend I have "profits." If I did, people who understand how the world works would make fun of me, like I'm making fun of you.

Did he sell? If he did not sell, he booked no profit at all.
