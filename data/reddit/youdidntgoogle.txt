Oh those can be verified through RFID reader. Go get a RFID reader. Nice one off Amazon. :) They are worth a little more when they are physical coins but the price changes so who know/s.

If BTC is bad because criminals then I argue then using Internet is bad because criminals. 
I know many criminals who use English to communicate they should switch to Japanese if they want to use the "if criminals use" arguments.

Your question is "will bitcoin increase in value?" ignore all the other shit in your post.
My answer: don't give advice to anybody if your source of info is a mildly autistic subreddit.

....You probably shouldn't be doing anything with bitcoin. You don't seem to get it...

Wait what?


Umm..... So.... Nobody is saying/preventing women from getting involved with crypto. 
Are you protesting men to "allow" women to buy crypto or are you protesting women to get more involved? I am confused. 
And why is nearly your entire post history deleted?

For BTC it's not possible your GPU isn't profitable. Even if you had the right equipment your friends are not enough. All of you together don't know that yet, which means all of you together should research considerably more prior to proceeding.

It's called Math. There's calculators for it on a thing called Google. Your posting right now because you didn't/cant do any math.
The only honest answer your gonna get from me is not to mine at all if you need help with math.

Yes yes yes and at what point do you add in "JESUS WILL SAVE YOUR SOUL."  "HELL IS COMING" and "REPENT" because I feel like your shit lacks the weird Jesus vibe.

It's complete bullshit. For anyone who doesn't want to double check. Coming from a bullshit account.

"I had money nearly a decade ago, dunno who what when or where but can you get that for me? Thanks." 
When you get married a wife will help you manage your money, that's the only good news your getting. If you have the records why the hell you asking us. If you don't have the records, still, why the hell...
