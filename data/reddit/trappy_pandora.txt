The third one may involve me having to have a talk with the administrator, but I'm certain that you'd be allowed to peddle your shirts there too. Have you ever tried a bitcoin transaction using multiple signatures? Unlike Silk Road 2, these markets offer escrow protection.

With a nation subsidizing it? They could theoretically make a competitor that could enter the US market!

If forex exchanges try to clamp down on bitcoin because of this, I will cry.

Their propaganda arm is strong, I feel that would translate into strong marketing prowess during a foray into the US market. They would of course never achieve parity with native US card companies, but they would feasibly be able to compete strongly with smaller US based payment processors by offering a better service at a lower price.

It's changed the drug trade for the better too. @_date: 2015-07-26 06:08:46
I'm glad that circle has been kind to the customers that **I** sent them.

Mining? I didn't think that was still profitable.

Its not something that can be confirmed, exchange employees might be free to resteal the bitcoins with impunity but they would never release dox or else their exchange suffers.
I'm assuming that the main wallet belongs to btc-e because their exchange works over tor, although many exit nodes are banned.

What is the time table for state level actors to be able to crack bitcoin's crypto? Are there plans for improving its cryptography?
