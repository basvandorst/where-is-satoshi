Not really... the reason for the long lines don't have to do with currency. 
In Peru, the average person does not do Internet transactions. A lot of people don't have access to the Internet and if they did they would not feel safe exchanging money through it. 
The people standing in line are there to cash their checks and pay their bills because they don't do online stuff. Some of them may not even have direct deposit setup or even debit cards because they'd rather cash their checks and take the money home. 
The average person would not be technologically or financially able to use Bitcoin. Smartphones are expensive and not even that ubiquitous yet.  
I feel like in countries like this were the internet has not been widely adapted by everyone, Bitcoin will remain a niche "luxury". Yes, **luxury** because in order to use it, one not only needs to have access to the internet and have portable "devices" but also the technological know how that comes with interacting with computers on a regular basis for all things.  Some places may start accepting and using it here and there but then that will be a tiny percentage of the population.

You are right. Long lines at banks happen because of a combination of people paying their bills and cashing/depositing their bi-weekly checks. Some people don't like banks and prefer the cash so they don't do "direct-deposits".
However, I think this could be a bank right next to a government building. You get long lines in such cases because all processing fees for licenses, ids, birth certificates, etc. have to be paid at the "Bank of the Nation". After you paid, you take the receipt to back to the Gov branch and complete your transaction. There's usually a branch of this bank right next to gov buildings for this reason. 
So basically this is like the line at the DMV.
