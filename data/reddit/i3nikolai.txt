Then you have to assume they are already dominating the market and so are still barely break-even. But we also know that the vast majority of of mining happens in industrial operations that most definitely have to pay for power and which make very low margins. 
In the "perfect sphere" scenario the profit margin is epsilon. But this argument works just as well if the profit margin is very high, say 10% (which is clearly much higher than reality).
The purpose of this discussion (I'll be reposting it occasionally) is to reduce the number of plug-your-ears reactions. Can I count you in the "it won't happen" camp?

Hmm, this suggests a strategy: prepare a one-time difficulty reset hard-fork which is activated under specific conditions, like if average block time goes over 20 minutes in the first 4 hours or something.

I don't think you really understood the argument if you say this. Once profit margins are thin enough, the halving will cause a large enough proportion of miners ("all of them" adjusted for realities, so maybe 75%) to simultaneously drop off, which massively increases the time interval until the next difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:33:48
The halving is in about 6 months. The fees are currently under 1% of block reward. I think you're in denial =\

It mostly has to do with the fact that I obsess over this technology anyway and my productive output is much higher when I work on this. The fact that I'm effectively my own boss on a day-to-day basis is another huge plus - I didn't really like my internships at other tech companies because my work ethic is manic-depressive and doesn't fit normal schedules.
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:49:12
You have it pretty much right.
1) 50 BTS + transaction fees per block. Block timing is deterministic so this happens once very ~17 minutes.
2) Delegates set their pay rate at registration, and can lower but not raise it. By default delegates have 0% approval meaning you have to actively be voted in, harder than just not getting voted out.
3) yes
4) "enough" people were cool with it (though technically I would only need 1/3rd of the approval I have now to stay in the top 101).
At current rates (~50 BTS every ~17 mins) it turns into about $2,500/mo. Not at all close to google, but what we didn't mention because it makes a less exciting story is that I have a short runway and some extra BTS from I3 (company that crowdfunded initial development but is now mothballed) which makes it at least comparable to a tech startup with a salary/equity tradeoff. In exchange I agreed not to campaign for more than 1 delegate spot for a while, the idea being we should grow the value of BTS so that eventually 1 spot is enough for 1 full-time salary.

I claim mining is one of the worst forms of distribution possible because miners are a network *cost* who will sell coins on average more than people who precommit. NXT works off of one of the worst pure POS distributions possible.

Only to a minor extent. The closest you can get is to make an easy tool for BTC stake-polling, so that you can see what the "shareholders" (bitcoin holders) think of any particular effort. Unfortunately, bitcoin cannot perform this polling on-chain (as part of validation logic), and even if it could, it cannot direct BTC away from miners to "real" work because it would violate the deeply established consensus about what BTC is.
Or course the bitcoin foundation could do all their stuff on their own independent blockchain+token, but that token would have its own independent value and its not clear how the incentives would work between BTC and the foundation.

Sort of - it would have to make a few big changes that would make it less appealing:
* Traders would not tolerate ~10 minute confirmation times after seeing 10 second confirmations on DPOS.
* Orphaned blocks are a much bigger problem for exchange transactions than for normal transfers, since the vast majority of the time you cannot migrate them and so your effective confirmation time is stretched to multiple blocks.
* bitshares guys are extremely value-conscious (the founder coined the term "proof of waste" which makes us very unpopular among bitcoiners =P) meaning they would not tolerate having BTC be the stake or bitasset colllateral.
But, the high-level bitasset mechanism could work on any sufficiently powerful blockchain (so a sidechain with custom validation could work).

Maybe I'm confusing the architecture with something else (treechains?) - but I thought a sidechain doesn't get "truly" confirmed until bitcoin miners approve it. This means you can have multiple blocks on the sidechain, but you don't actually know if it will make it into the main chain until the next block.

Depends on what your risk assessment about centralized institution insolvency vs massive price collapse of a free-floating asset with subsequent undercollateralization of the bitasset.

The first two failure modes you described are totally different. In the second case, it's not a *failure* if your *goal* is to track USD price with interest that beats inflation using only the tools of a cryptocurrency. The first failure mode is because of bad systems which can be made transparent and publicly auditable on a blockchain.

But it would be so horribly inefficient compared to ethereum unless you made drastic, fundamental changes to bitcoin's protocol. Actually, all bitcoin has to do to be turing-complete is implement a single JMPZ op in the existing bitcoin script language. But since that seems like it won't happen any time soon, we're stuck with "interpretation-only" protocols riding on bitcoin (XCP, MSC), or forced to make separate blockchains.

They're collateralized at least 2x by BTSX, the underlying crypto-asset. They're created by someone going short USD against BTSX and are destroyed when the short buys it back to cover (or is force called).
You don't redeem BitUSD for USD, you redeem it for $1 worth of BTSX. Of course for the average user, there would be gateways that can convert USD and bitUSD back and forth for a fee, so then the answer is "you redeem bitUSD via coinbase / bitpay analogue".

No - delegates are not the ones holding the collateral and the delegates are selected by approval voting from stakeholders which means they cannot control the protocol without stakeholder consent. Putting bad price information requires a 51% approval from *shares*, not delegates.
DPOS appears "centralized" because delegates are individuals, but I dare any delegate to try any sort of collusion or manipulation. Much less likely than a mining pool or a ripple unique node deciding to do something bad.

Delegates can set their pay rate as a % of maximum possible pay. I was the first to get a 100% delegate - prior to that everyone had the "standard" 3% you get for being a simple block validator. Now there are still mostly 3% delegates with some 100%'s and a few in between.
@_date: 2014-12-14 00:55:58
The real answer to your question is that if BTS falls by 300% nearly instantly and stays that way, your bitUSD would be worth the average collateral per bitUSD at whatever the BTS market price is.
But you can have BTS fall by more than 300% if it does so "smoothly" - everything bitcoin has experienced in its past would have been fine.
Right now it is half the price it was a month ago but collateralization is well above (300%/2 =) 150%. Margins get called on the way down, so total collateral is reduced but also bitUSD supply is reduced to a lesser extent. Shorts which have not expired that need to turn over are constantly buying back bitUSD and re-entering with fresh collateral, and they must actually have $3 worth of BTS at market price at the time they enter.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:58:43


I agree about "disrupted" but not "coopted". You worst you can is have clients freeze up and say "there a longer fork but I'm not switching to it because I'm not rolling back more than 300 blocks - please pick which fork you'd like to stay on". With DPOS short-term security is better than POW (probability of double-spending with a decent fraction of stake/hashpower is close to 0) and with TAPOS+checkpoints long-term security is better than POW (you will never ever be to trick existing clients to throw out that chain).

Yes, efficiency always goes up before cost, that's why the "real difficulty" is always below the "adjusted difficulty" except for the very recent first-even diff drop. But the point is that miners ALWAYS catch up.


If they made a 1% profit margin before, and now they make 5%, that's an opportunity for more people to mine profitably. Knowing this you jump on the opportunity to expand back to make your 1% margin and stay in business for the next adjustment. 
And even if you don't, the difficulty will drop and other miners who couldn't mine profitably will start.
The expenditures will always tend towards the costs (expenditures include the employee salaries who *might* keep some in BTC), meaning no matter what the vast majority of mined BTC must be sold.

Let's say 1 BTS = 1 USD for simplicity.
You place a short order with 3 BTS. If it fills you now have 4 BTS, 3 of which are locked up. Some other guy, who did a normal bid, ends up with the bitUSD, which he bought with the 1 BTS you now have. You hope the price of USD falls because then you can buy it back for cheaper than 1 BTS and so you made a profit.


Not if you're paying for leverage! Why does bitfinex charge you to short, when you are required to also put down collateral?


If demand for holding bitUSD grows, its price will grow relative to BTS. If 1 bitUSD is worth more than 1 real USD then there is a profit motive to short because there is nothing supporting the price of bitUSD for any value over $1. The only reason most people ever "issue" (short) bitUSD is if it is overvalued so that you can profit from correcting its price.

I'm not saying that risk isn't there, just that nushares and bitshares have different mechanisms for turning the counterparty risk into systemic risk. Nushares socializes the losses among all NSR holders, bitshares forces the guy who took the short to eat the loss.
By the way the actual answer is "the market engine force-settles bitUSD holders into BTS" which is not good news for the holder, it's just the last resort mechanism. In practice the total supply of bitassets goes to 0 before the collateral becomes insufficient. How extreme a price drop has to be is up for debate, but the important thing to realize is that it is the drop *speed* and not *magnitude* which matters. BTS has suffered roughly 5x loss form its peak while maintaining collateral ratio of about 250% because shorts are forced to turn over.
@_date: 2014-12-31 04:09:29
Bitcoin needs a healthy derivative market to be able to grow in value without huge bubbles like we have seen ~3 times already. Being able to short BTC (or leverage up on BTC for that matter) lets capital move into the market while spreading the effect of increasing the price over time. Centralized derivative markets are always vulnerable to manipulation and undercollateralization.
BTS holders benefit from people speculating on the relative direction of BTC compared to fiat/gold/silver/bts inside BTS in the same way that bitfinex does when you trade on bitfinex. BTS just lets anyone play the role of bitfinex shareholder. BTS is not intended to be a replacement currency for BTC.
The only real "danger" is if bitUSD and other bitFiats gain commercial success, while BTC fizzles out. But if that happens I really doubt BTS would be the cause (though it's very flattering if you think it would). Ripple already exists and is ready to take the blockchain fiat market anyway, and its 10x more successful than BTS at the moment. BTS is like a more decentralized ripple.

Correct. Centralized entities can still gox you! The option to have a freezable IOU changes nothing.
bitUSD is not bitstamp USD, it is the new market mechanism that lets you have a fungible CFD / no counterparty risk. These are what cannot be frozen and are the real value proposition of bitshares! The gateway assets are just that - centralized gateway assets. You can never stop centralized gateways from goxing you. Don't use their IOUs, stick with bitUSD.

It is vulnerable to an extreme BTSX flash crash but it isn't analagous to a run on the bank at all. 100% of bitUSD users could choose to cash out all at once and it would be fine. The problem is only when BTSX has a catastrophic loss of value but bitUSD holders hold ("catastrophic" like far in excess of any volatility we ever saw with BTC - current collateralization levels could have handled the old $30 to $2 collapse gracefully if it were riding on BTC).
It's a risk tradeoff which I'd accept for the interest I get on bitUSD (from shorts paying to short and from transaction fees). To each their own though, obviously you cannot have a USD derivative without risk.

Nushares has a slightly different approach, there is no individual's collateral backing the asset, instead the entire nushareholder base votes on when to buy back nubits by diluting nushares. This post appears to be describing bitshares/bitUSD without naming them.

It's not an IOU from an individual, it's an IOU from a chain which has on-chain collateral backing it. You can have more confidence in it than in a user-issued USD token.
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:32:40
The collateral requirement is 3x the dollar value. The example 3 was because we assumed 1 BTS was worth $1. The price feeds are used to set this initial collateral requirement.
The contract is not between two parties - the long position is fungible and the short doesn't care which bitUSD he uses to cover. The shorts are required to cover every 30 days, meaning there is constant buy pressure up to $1 per bitUSD, but the bitUSD holder can choose to *never* let go. Whenever he does, he should expect a buy wall around $1, because you're guaranteed that price within 30 days and so there's opportunity for market makers to buy up discounted bitUSD.
Finally, regarding interest: This is set naturally by the market because shorts at the price feed are prioritized by what interest they offer. Right now the highest interest offered by a short that hasn't executed is 8%, but the majority of the bitUSD supply has come out of shorts with interest around 1%.
@_date: 2015-01-05 21:28:22
This is a good point, one thing that partially mitigates this is that you can place a feed-relative order meaning market-making can be effectively free for simple strategies
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:17:38
The price is ultimately guaranteed by the price feed which forces margin calls (margins are well in excess of real value, 300% initial collateral), but on top of that you have market incentives to push the price towards the feed because you can profit.

I think you have it backwards. A BTS holder who wants leverage on bts can go short USD. He already has $3 worth of BTS based on the established price from external exchanges. He can lock that BTS and sell a brand new bitUSD into the market. This collateral is part of the pool that supports the bitUSD price, as the guy who shorted has to take that $3 (or more or less) and buy back one bitUSD in order to reclaim the remainder of the collateral. The turnover rate of the shorts ensures that there is enough collateral to buy back the entire bitUSD supply and then some at all times.
Going short is *like* being given a loan in the way that a bank "gives you a loan" - it prints some dollars and tell you that you better repay them later.

You only go short if you expect BTS to grow against bitUSD, you are not loaning BTS, you are borrowing dollars because you are already long and want to buy even more BTS. The blockchain *gives* the loan, the bitUSD shorter *borrows* the bitUSD but effectively instantly sells it. So actually the person going short is the one who pays the interest (shorts are prioritized by offered interest rate) and the bitUSD holder is the one who gets the return.
Same way bitfinex requires collateral and charges you interest to "print BTC" into their order books, except the role of BTS and USD is reversed in this case.
All that volatility is forced into BTS, because the price feed forces settlement at $1 and so anyone who doesn't want to speculate gets a "free" return by pushing it to $1 and no other price. The only conclusion is that maybe BTS shorters are fools for paying such high interest to go short at such low prices above $1.

@_date: 2015-01-05 22:34:47
You should look into the design. Inside BTS itself, you only hold bitUSD, bitGOLD, bitBTC, etc - price-tracking assets that come from a fungible CFD, which means there's no counterparty and nobody who has to follow AML/KYC since the backing is provided by thousands of independent short positions.
Now the *gateways* have to follow all these rules, as do external exchanges. But they only need to hold funds for very short periods of time.
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:30:12
Sure. They're basically the long position in a CFD against BTS (300% initial reserve) but they are fungible and there is one market engine managing the margin/collateral.
In the beginning, there is BTS, which is an altcoin just like bitcoin. It has wide initial distribution and is traded on many liquid markets, so we know its "true" price. This price is fed into the system using price feeds from delegates, which are the most approved block producers by stake-vote. Once a short seller and a buyer are matched, the bitUSD is created and given to the buyer. He can hold onto it as long as he likes or trade it like a normal cryptocurrency with normal buy/sells. The short position has bitUSD debt and BTS locked in collateral well in excess of that debt. If the price starts moving against the short or if the short position expires, the market will buy back bitUSD at any price up to the price feed to force the short to cover. This creates systemic demand for the asset. The asset's price remains pegged because the farther it moves from the feed the more profit there is to be made by bringing it back and waiting for the shorts to turn over.

Put another way, bitcoin only lets me shoot myself in the foot in a few well-understood ways.

@_date: 2015-08-04 15:41:37
The blockchain does, because it can lock up (volatile) crypto. The basic idea is:
1) keep excess collateral locked up on-chain
2) use market incentives to keep collateral levels high (you're either leveraged long and so presumably willing to buy in more when you are getting low, or you cover fast before prices move to hurt you)
3) iterate to reduce systemic risk
Probably the only people who you could convince this is a "guarantee" are those that are willing to accept there is more than 1% chance of a major sovereign defaulting each year. If you want *real* fiat guarantees, that is a legal concept which crypto cannot do.

No, the backing token and the volatile token can be different assets. So you can back BTC with ETH or USD with BTC or whatever.
You cannot *guarantee* it, only assure it will retain its value with a high probability per unit time, using certain financial instruments. At the end of the day that is what the real banking system does, since your deposited dollars never just sit there, they are used for something else. The main difference is that these crypto solutions have excess reserves instead of fractional reserves.

With private money you'd no longer have monopoly pricing on financing, which cuts directly into the banking cartel (and so the state's) profits. If you took this away then their resources would all have to come from taxation.
I don't actually want to argue that it'd reduce money laundering. The idea of money laundering is just a tool to help enforce other crimes (not paying taxes, mostly). It's too bad that's the starting example because it confounds 2 points I'd argue separately.
I'm more concerned with straight up theft in the form FRB+interest. Bitcoin, as bad as its economic fundamentals are, is the first thing that might actually keep them honest.

He didn't say it was a problem. "Companies putting profit before people are just rational actors" sounds bad until you remember companies are made out of people! I would rather others be concerned about how to generate profit for themselves than to be concerned about "putting people first" and not producing anything.

Margin traders will margin trade, whether on bitfinex or a highly regulated exchange or an underground exchange.
If bitcoin is at risk because of financial instruments people can build using it, it was fucked to begin with.

When you aren't an expert in some subject matter, there are a lot of heuristics you can use to infer what you might think if you were, based on what other people are saying. It's not perfect, but it's still pretty reliable.
One heuristic is that someone with a valid and cogent justification for their position will *NEVER* want to engage in censorship.

Because you can confirm it's following the rules. You realize your questions are exactly like some of the most common questions people ask about bitcoin, if you say "bitcoin is a public ledger maintained on a decentralized network".

i can't believe this is literally happening and people are still confused about whether and why bitcoin has value
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:31:07
bitcoin provides a service (transmitting value) and has a cashflow analysis (its income comes from transaction fees, it's expenditures are 100% of its income and then some via inflation). You certainly could take the company metaphor and conclude bitcoin is an extremely unprofitable company

You're being snarky but there are real advantages to using a blockchain even if control is centralized. The transparency and instant settlement are still valuable.
@_date: 2015-04-03 06:37:12
So are you saying banks have blockchain research teams just to capitalize on the bitcoin hype? What do you think they're up to?

Why is vote buying bad? There's already a $ value on swaying a vote via advertising campaigns. Why can't that money go straight to me? If I can vote for someone just because he's black, why can't I vote for someone just because he wants to give me $100?

You mean 51% of miners? Miners are a very very tiny subset of bitcoin users

The video you linked has to do with vote-buying in congress (and other bodies of government other than the general election). Can you link to resources related to vote-buying of the general public's votes?
Second question, is it *morally acceptable* for me to choose to vote however someone offering me $100 says I should vote?
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:17:44
The voice of the people is still being represented - the people chose to vote for the guy who gave them $100. Don't encroach on my freedom to vote however I want!
It's the same as now when the politician promises to give them $$ of government benefits, just with less bullshit in between.
I guess I'm preaching to the choir though.

Looks a lot like bitshares and the process for creating bitUSD and bitBTC. The debt/collateral has its own market price and is denominated in an independent cryptocurrency which "owns" the exchange, like equity.

BTS needs to trade on external exchanges to have price discovery for internal assets to be able to track, at least until gateways are online (which would still be centralized). The point is that bitAssets are decentralized in the sense that they don't have a counterparty and can't be frozen / shut down. It's still the only option for decentralized dollars or gold or whatever. 
Love you too!
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:49:32
It's not decentralized unless there are n+1 gateways, where n is the number of gateways online

If you just want to be able to hold and transfer then it doesn't matter. If you want to be able to "trade bitcoins for USD" as OP wants to do then you would have to trust an exchange which means you can't place orders without exchange risk. With nubits if I want to hold large sums and quickly convert to and from BTC I basically have to hold both in an exchange.

How does segwit enable new opcodes? I meant opcodes that manipulate Bitcoin, not new interpreted layers (I can already run the "EVM" via counterparty, ha ha). Am I missing something?


I'm also welcome to rewrite the OS I'm using to develop, it has a few issues
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:58:01
Thoughts on integrating bitAssets on BTS network (bitUSD, bitCNY, bitGOLD, etc)? bter, btc38, and yunbi have all integrated, seems more popular in China than in the west.
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:44:05
I don't get the title, it made it sound like a negative piece, but then it was a totally pro-BTS article.
@_date: 2015-02-14 21:39:46
bitshares.org is exactly what you want, absolutely no centralized counterparties or legal entaglements, but you can get price exposure to USD and BTC. So you'd convert BTC to and from bitBTC instantly via a bridge and then trade bitBTC against bitUSD directly on the blockchain.  search "bitUSD" on coinmarketcap, also see the other assets here:

-.- I *want* to shoot myself in the foot, please! You can tout the deliberately stunted trx language which requires the entire network to review each bit of new functionality as a "safety" feature, but then you can't say bitcoin is suitable as a target chain for complex dapps. I really did try to think of how to make bitcoin suitable for this task. That's ok, bitcoin is still digital gold, nothing will fill that niche better.
