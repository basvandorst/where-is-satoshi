Pretty sure it was was the mixture of the anime posts and random replies with emojis and strange formatting that prompted for the tempban for suspicious activity

what the best way to sell the B2X?

ITT: People all trying to guesstimate the lowest point of the dip and buy Bitcoin then. 
Just do the 10-Day investment plan. Find out how much you want to put into Bitcoin and divide that by 10. Every day for 10 days invest that tenth, over the 10 days you will get the median price over those 10 days.

Gemini then.

How so? I assume all he's missing is a bank account. Even then he can set one up through e-trade for free and sign up at any exchange. I don't believe gemini needs a bank account either, only a debit card.

You can setup a exchange account and use a prepaid debit card to purchase.

Interesting, I also found out a few days back the Gemini (the crypto to usd exchange platform) is owned by one of the Winklevoss twins (the guys who claim they originally created the idea for facebook).

We've thought of that aswell :)
Currently everything on our database is encrypted with exception of the email address, and the wallet address with bcrypt and are only held so that users can have ease of checking their balances. To send transactions users must A. Maually input their private key, or save the private key on a seperate external database.

"You can try to hack a coldwallet, but it will be incredibly difficult. That's the point of it being "cold" (Not connected to any network). You can steal it if you know the private key, though it is tough to guess, and certainly over a billion people would of surely attempted this by now including some heist pros."

Well, according to the article it says:


So this isn't in immediate effect, however with this not being regulated as a currency I'm curious what differences it has from being a currency vs commodity.

website can be a wallet, as far as I'm aware a wallet is software that houses cryptocurrency address' and keys.

If you expect to find any pro's here consider this. This is like asking Republicans what are the pros and cons of Sanders being president. Your going to get biased answers. Read online yourself and sort the pros and cons without biased feedback.

This comment is nothing but facts, but it hurts so much.
A moment of silence for one costly mistake.~

That's a dangerous statement to make in this part of town.

Starting off small and simple, as we learn more we'll be doing more!

I think I understand but can you elaborate on what type of timelock? From what I've read there are hold timelocks where you can't spend coin from a wallet until a set date. There's time-of-day timelocks that only allow you to trade at a set point during the day. What specifically do you mean, all of those options would be easy to implement.
