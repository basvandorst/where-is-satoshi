Why would i be happy with bitcoin at 50k if i hold altcoins?
Imagine, Bitcoin bull run, all alt money goes to btc. Alts go down in sats. Then, btc reached 50k but what no one is mentioning, it will fall back again until what value? In the mean time, alts will be rekt again.
I dont want btc to be 50K, i want it to be steady.

I still can’t understand why people are not getting their bitcoins back and he can sell this with enormous profit while this belongs to the previous owners.

I don’t care a F for bitcoin, but that it can destabilize the complete crypto market is beyond absurd.
So many good projects are being developed, all being crashed.. 
Can we finally detach altcoins from bitcoin so every project can grow or shrink to its true value?

So, it’s not good?

So it will have more exposure in advance. I could imagine NYSE customers start buying themselves on exchanges too.

Again? Did i just missed something?

Could be many things why they removed it
- it is placed somewhere else (perhaps they use it at several locations for a short time)
- i will be replaced by a new one soon
- people who decided to remove it have only a short term vision / interest
- atm could be stolen
- they think bitcoin price is tanking because of the particular atm

You don’t get it. So you only pay with fiat for stuff you need, and careful save your bitcoin?
Why not buy more bitcoins, spend equal value of btc what you would spend with fiat and hold the same amount of btc like you planned to?
See what i mean?

I wonder, who is paying for the advertisement?

People are anxious to spend their bitcoin while there is no reason to. 
Whether you pay cash or bitcoin, you have to pay anyway for services or goods. It doesn’t make any difference how you pay for it for the value of your holdings.
Just exchange more fiat for btc and start spending it. Just don’t spend it all, like you wouldn’t with your savings either.
You won’t miss out on spending BTC as long as you keep buying it.
