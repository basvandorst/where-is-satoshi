I would love to be part of finding an acceptable solution, but at this moment I have no creative idea for that. Maybe we would need to offload the transactions somehow to secondary chains... 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:07:40
get ARK or NEO for that instead of BTC.... but if you simply hodl your BTC they will most likely increase in value anyway
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:59:08
Might be, but for a new coin to properly serve as a store of value it must have a limited supply, no pre-mining and be decentralized... I believe that BTC complies to this and 2nd/3rd layers could be implemented by something like Cardano or Ark with a tight integration of the BTC blockchain into their systems

What are you trying to say? Nothing in cryptocurrency trading is regulated, and gladly so IMO... Forking Bitcoin to update the protocol is expected behavior and the weaker chain (market decides which chain that is) was supposed to die off. So it didn't die off because both chains seem to have value... there is no scam in that, only competition (I don't expect neither BTC nor BCH will die off now, both have their merrits).

First of all take a deep breath and relax. There is no need for panic, you almost doubled your initial investment in a couple of months. You did good, but you might want to learn about stop-loss orders. 
You could set a buy order for a price below the point where you sold and just wait. The market is volatile enough IMO that we will see an other dip... might be today, this week or next month... nobody knows (we'd all be trillionaires if we knew).

I don't see the problem and fail to understand whar you want to do about it. 
I installed the app, created both a BTC and BCH wallet that conveniently have the same address. So it doesn't matter if someone sends me BCH/BTC... I am protected from being dumb enough to give the sender a wrong address. Problem solved.

My impression of Ver is that he is opportunistic enough to go where the wind takes him and knows how to create an environment that will benefit him first. That being said, he is only one guy (true, who controls a % of hashrate). If he were to stand alone in this game, the BCH chain would have died off.... but it is being mined and did create a true value. I don't expect it to drop to 0, nor to go to 0.5+ BTC. I don't see people buying a BCH as being scammed, they do get a coin with a certain value and especially one that will benefit them when retailers/service providers start to embrace BCH... 
Does this mean I agree with marketing BCH as BTC? Nope, BTC is Bitcoin for me and BCH is Bitcoin Cash.... Do I prefer to use BCH over BTC when buying a coffee? Yes, as things are at this very moment I do (also mainly because VTC isn't widespread yet, I would buy coffee woth VTC if possible).
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:10:16
That is the main problem with this whole discussion: immature kids trolling, maybe you should just listnen when the grownups talk and maybe learn something for a change. It doesn't matter which address I give for someone to send me that 1 BTC... big difference . If I am careless and give them my BCH address it will work out fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:58:14
Now you are actually making a point for BCH instead of BTC. BTC is not as easily accessible at the moment with long times to confirm transactions....  And to avoid a % of the population to be misled we better ban all  advertising in general than BCH vs BTC.... way more people that need to be protected from tv commercials than the 1 or 2 who think BCH is BTC
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:02:31
wether we like it or not, BCH is not going away anymore, too many people have too much to loose if it did... seems like even Coinbase will make it available per 2018... also Bitmex already put in the engineering time to make the BCH futures available
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:51:43
For me it doesn't really matter wether BTC or BCH is 'the Bitcoin'. Both have their merrits. 
i also believe that it doesn't matter what Satoshi had in mind when he wrote the whitepaper, this is not religion. Times change, the market changes and Bitcoin should be able to evolve. BCH is probably a better fit to the whitepaper and surely a better fit for my personal needs. Then again, I own both and have my reasons for that (as I have motivations to also own other coins).
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:59:48
It is exactly the same, only at a much larger scale... 10 Days ago a lot of people let greed get the better hand of themselves and they sold their BTC to buy BCH in order to make huge profits... now some managed to do this and others lost... but by all means it's their own responsibility. Nobody had a gun against their heads when buying BCH...

Cryptocurrency hasn't had much traction so far and 1MB blocks already proof to be a problem...  1GB is only 1000x the capacity we have now with BTC. Storage is not the problem, but transmission will be an issue and processing power to mine a block like that as well... 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:54:48
up until the fork BTC and BCH where 1... so per protocol upon forking one of them was supposed to die off and the other be BTC... in that light it kind of makes sense that BCH calls itself BTC... both chains are Bitcoin by DNA, the market will decide which is BTC. I expect that is already settled actually as BCH is BCH, the real battle now is about acceptance (and I don't see why a shop wouldn't be able to accept both chains). 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:34:43
The main problem however is that this problem could occur at any moment again and that it is ignored because at this exact moment all is fine. Wouldn't we all benefit from a BTC that is more robust and where the pool can deal with this sort of spam?

@_date: 2017-11-20 09:41:16
Nobody is being mislead by a fork. People who are smart enough to invest in cryptocurrency are smart enough to read about BCH and BTC. Or are you saying that everybody is so dumb that they can't? Now that would be a huge insult to any investor....

Here in the Netherlands only 125,000 out of 17.5M population have invested in cryptocurrency... most of them for less than €100... and they don't do many transactions.... so 1000x the current transaction volume isn't really far fetched once we get mainstream adoption...  If we like BTC/BCH to do anything more than store value we do need to come up with a different way of scaling than simply keep expanding blocksize. We do have some time to figure that out, as I don't expect to reach this kind of volume anytime soon... but nevertheless it's smart to think about these issues and plan ahead...
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:45:15
Wait a second with that party: Bitmex is a business, so they want to maximize their profits... so why is it more profitable for them to give clients BTC instead of BCH? after all they should simply have the BCH laying around and could hand them over to the clients without any efforts... but still they go through the trouble to convert them to BTC first... What is the catch?
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:58:53
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:11:06
I don't think that we are inflating a bubble, BTC (and other cryptocurrencies) do have a value and that value will increase when more people want to be part of it. Scaling is essential to make that possible... as quoted from the movie Jaws "We'll need a bigger boat!" to be able to accommodate larger volume. At this very moment BCH is better equipped to handle a larger volume, but I have no doubt that BTC will also find a way to scale. BCH will also need to evolve as simply making blocks bigger isn't a sustainable solution either... If you are holding since before the fork, than you should own 1 BTC for every BCH and you will benefit from either which chain goes up... if you decided to trade one of them you have had the free will to swing left or right and accepted a risk...

Et voila: they are identical in this wallet....
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:34:33
Gladly it doesn't happen every day! But if a group of people decide to do just that today, there is nothing stopping them. What is the BTC defense? We (community, not you and me) should come up with a defence mechanism against such an attack and let the BTC protocol evolve. 
Let it be clear that I would love for the BTC protocol to be able to retain it's funtion as both a value store and a p2p currency. Likewise I am glad to see BCH evolve into a serious cryptocurrency. I couldn't care less which of them  evolves to become 'the Bitcoin'. Personally, coinwise, I believe more in BCH than in LTC (technical aspect more in VTC than BCH, but VTC still lacks organization). 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:56:32
For this moment it is viable, but it's not an endless trick... Somewhere there is a maximum blocksize that is workable and that causes a hard limit on scalability. I know blocksizes of 1GB have been tested, but that is too large IMO. Not only for storage, but also for transferring and for computing them... So BCH also will need to come up with something else at some point in time.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:16:14
technical yes, we could program something like this from scratch and make it available as opensource... but how to get it to overtake the BTC+several other marketcap especially with all the current political games?

yeah, sadly same here... I guess more people using their servers now and they were not prepared for this wave of additional volume... they also have the CloudFlare DDOS protection activated, that's an other sitnal that their infrastructure is used to the limit (and they should add additional servers)

Oh, you actually are a 12 year old and it's not an act. In that case ask your mommy if she can look twice when paying your allowance in BTC so she doesn't mistake it with BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:37:29
You are actually making it more complicated... 
People buy BTC or BCH (BCC in Bittrex, that actually is a problem to be solved).... So BTC goes up 20%, BCH goes up 15%... if they bought BTC they are better off in this case, but if they bought BCH it's still 15% up.... (and lower fees when moving them, so maybe even better nett gains).

spending and storing wealth are two very different aspects of money.... there is no need to do both with the same tool
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:46:50
in theory.... but now we have BCH and BTC who both will live on. (and possibly a few miners forking SX2 on their own and the BTG scam).
Problem is that any fork with a little support is valued at too much from the start to die off... Consensus between miners has proven to be essential for upgrades to a blockchain and shown to be unlickely to achieve on anything mayor (Segwit, SX2, DAO at ETH, etc)
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:34:19
Cryptocurrency is still 'wild west'. BTC went up 43% or so in a month... People investing in it should 'DYOR' and read/inform before doing anything. BCH is no scam or counterfeit and should not be underestimated. I dont like forking either, but It is how cryptocurrency works...BCH is probably not going away anymore and if you dont like it then ignore it.... I own both BTC and BCH (and a selection of other coins). BTC at 8100 is a smile on my face, BCH at 1300 also a smile... 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:07:00
That's why we will use an other cryptocurrency for day to day transactions and BTC for storing wealth. After all not every person on this planet owns gold or silver but does use fiat for their expenses...
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:19:41
quoting the article:
"As a result of the larger block size, higher levels of mining and storage equipment are required to run a node. The greater barrier to entry could lead to mining centralization."
- Could lead... so nothing is certain
- If it leads towards centralization you are assuming that would happen in China... 
Big difference from already centralizing in China...

3 or 4 days ago people were copy-pasting a badly translated rumour where China would ban or limit mining due to misusage of electricity..... Since China already limited trade, it wouldn't be impossible that they would actually crackdown on mining. Next we see countries like Venezuela (virtually free electricity and hyperinflation) take an interest at mining... 
In crypto nothing is obvious or written in stone until it actually happened.

I think if you or I would fork a chain, it would die off per protocol as not a single miner will follow us.... and that's a good thing. 
BCH has forked off to evolve the protocol.... wether or not you believe that change in the protocol is an improvement doesn't really matter as the market has decided that it is worth something (at this moment just under 1200 US$).... Whatever Roger Ver thinks also doesn't really matter as the market will decide what the place of BCH is. I see an advantage in the BCH protocol over the current BTC protocol, I also expect the BTC protocol to evolve (actuall both will evolve). And that is why I own both.... financially a flippening would benefit me as my current portfolio balance is about 1 BTC per every 3 BCH ( per 30 VTC)... but that is a whole different story and can change any moment I feel the need to move left or right...
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:03:56
I can replicate to create new wallets with the same address: add new wallet -&gt; advanced options -&gt; Wallet Key: copy from wallet... works between BCH and BTC no matter which you created first

Bitcoin is by far the biggest cryptocurrency, but there are 100s of other cryptocurrencies. The others are called altcoins.

Isn't that what is happening already with the whole BTC/BCH drama that's playing now?
