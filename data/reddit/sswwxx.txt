You sound like someone who unknowingly likes to compliment people.

No, that's just the propaganda in your groupthink bubble.  Your platform is illogical.  Pretending to be for poor Americans but wanting illegals, low skilled immigrants, open borders, eliminate ICE, sanctuary cities, etc.  That's real harm.  Just because you have good intentions doesn't mean the outcome of your illogical platform isn't going to be negative.  The vast majority of people have good intentions.  The openly accepted racism of the left that requires Asians and Whites to outperform blacks and Hispanics is also real harm.  Good intentions means nothing.  The left embraces a lot of racism.  That's why it litters online outlets.  The NYTs has no problem hiring people that were outwardly racist towards whites.  No harm from the high horse leftists though.

If you want to see the shitty leftists news networks called out daily then search Tim Pool and Timcast on YouTube.  He's a center-left journalist and exposes their crap daily.

You are in a bubble because you support Republicans. Logic. Lol.  I use to support the left till I realized how illogical the platform is and that the long-term consequences of it are catastrophic for the country.
Dems could easily come together with the Republican party and create laws.  Trump isn't preventing that.  Dems virtue signaling for votes against the interest of Americans is. That's why their platform is illogical.
Republicans not going into a church to arrest someone is pretty much the most irrelevant point one could make.  Hillary was running on importing 500k refugees from inbred countries.  That would piss me off.  Your point is insignificant and irrelevant.
But the Dems do and they will virtue signal on it.  They will paint anyone including yourself as a racist. Anything to divide Americans.  Which is exactly how they present issues regarding immigration by conflating illegals aliens and legal immigrants.  They paint racist narratives.  They'll do the same with affirmative action.

Can't callout bias news narratives without someone that digested the narratives getting on their high horse to disparge others.

"Nazis".  You should have put quotes on that.

If they collapse the country who is going to take care of all Africans?

He does interviews on YouTube.  Because Patreon is a shitty company that shows obvious political bias when it comes to banning users.  Therefore many (over 120) of his Patreon supporters are cancelling their donations.  He is giving them other methods so the terrible practices of the company doesn't hurt him.

He lives in a bubble and thrives on this stuff because it makes him feel superior to others.

I don't have a list of their nonsense but I've read multiple stories already that shined enough light for me not support that company.  They aren't much different than many tech companies though.  Most people will keep using them for the time being.  Rubin deals in the realm of politics which is why the people donating to him will be the first to exit the platform.
