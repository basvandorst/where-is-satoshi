But you wrote please refrain from posting mtgox databases as they were obtained by illegal means. 
That is what I was commenting on.

If Mark was the only one with access to the cold wallet, that lends further credence to the theory that he lost the keys or some how lost access to the wallet. Outlined here:  and similarly by kraken CEO earlier.

This is great news for Bitcoin... Regardless of your views on drugs and money transmission, those things are ilegal under US law, but there is an implicit defense of Bitcoin here...
From the [Press Release](
"...when Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of currency for illicit purposes."
What you are seeing there is an ACCEPTANCE of Bitcoin as legitimate, and a challenge to the commission of crimes.

Damn it, first Gix rendered all my bitcoin worthless, now Citibank was done the same for my dollars! Fortunately, I still have my Beanie Babies &amp; Franklin mint collectibles, At least until eBay.com fails!

You have no knowledge of how the data was acquired, and an a priori blocking of publication is a terrible precedent.
