BAN DHMO "The Invisible Killer
Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and kills uncounted thousands of people every year. Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death."

Right now i'm fairly certain that the number of shares available are based on previous investors willing to part with their restricted shares that finished a lock-up period (held for a year etc.). This limits the float. My understanding (and I could be wrong) is that they ceased looking for accredited investors ($25K+ blocks) because they anticipate listing on NYSE.  The NYSE I believe will not have this float restriction -- i.e. it will be an actual ETF.  Again the NYSE ETF has to be approved.....

@_date: 2017-01-21 00:53:20
It does sound cumbersome. But as it reads now it does not explicitly say they will be selling forked on your behalf and distributing as cash dividend. If (?) it states they will distribute the coin then that's what they  are required to do (if S1 is approved as is).
If Bitcoin is stored by Xapo then Xapo need only split the coin right? I believe (?) authorized participants only have Shares (IOUs) which represent a fractional interest in the Bitcoin.  That said the Authorized Participant may redeem the shares in large baskets for actual Bitcoin. That's my understanding from Winklevii (without going back to double check /doing the research again -- and assuming applicable here)
@_date: 2017-01-21 00:25:17
yup we discussed this...
however it appears to be "physical delivery" of forked coin back to shareholder ...and not a sale and cash distribution.....

VanEck is known SPECIFICALLY to making physical delivery of gold an option to their ETF Holders... I wrote about it in the article linked to the tweet
"Although it {Winklevoss filing} doesn't appear that ETFs are convertible into the underlying asset at the individual investor level, there are ETFs that are trying to let investors do just that.  Van Eck is one of those companies.  Kitco Metals Reports in “Proposed Van Eck Gold, Silver ETFs Would Allow Redemptions Of Metal” that:
"Several analysts told Kitco News that it appears the main factor differentiating this planned product from the majority of the existing ETFs in North America is the ability of investors to get their hands on physical gold or silver whenever they choose to exit, although they could also cash out."

"I'm concerned that there's such a large spread between the market price and the theoretical NAV. This makes me think that their system of Authorized Participants isn't actually working well."
This is because the way it is set up now it is NOT an ETF. There were until today shareholders of restricted securities that after 1 year lockup period had the choice to sell these shares as "GBTC" into the market which restricts the GBTC float. Just today they announced that they are no longer accepting private placement which puts a hard cap on the possible float.  This is the primary reason for the spread.

Q: What other ways are there for making decisions about what to add or not to the code?  A: If there are kind of critical high-risk security things, on those kinds of things Satoshi and I might just unilaterally decide this is an important enough fix that we just need to do it. No discussion. So, we will be benevolent dictators.  Q: What's the check on your benevolence?  A: Everybody can see the code that changed; people could simply refuse to download the new version of the software. If not everybody downloads and uses the new software then the change doesn't happen because what people are actually running defines the rules.

BTW my previous thoughts on the ETF: 
@_date: 2016-10-13 21:54:08
I think what the SEC is looking for here is to protect investors of the ETF so that they know what they are buying and that they know all available choices to the administrators of the ETF.  In this regards its important to disclose not only choices they are making.. but choices they are not.  If the ETF chooses not to do a 'poison pill' this is information that must be highlighted in their prospectus.

Bitcoin Hard Fork 'Poison Pill' via ETF with comments by @_date: 2016-10-13 02:11:28
Headaches are worth it if part of the distribution goes toward general administrative expenses.
For example " The Bitcoin Investment Trust™ charges an annual administration and safekeeping fee of 2.0%, which accrues daily"
I believe this impacts Bitcoin per Share ...currently 0.09414055‡

Re:  it only matters if they get some of the economy to go with them.
While the sponsors have a fiduciary duty to the holders (to get the best price for a forked coin) - if its in the form of a 'poison pill' the bylaws would likely indicate a timeframe that all the coins would have to be sold.  Since these ETFs hold a substantial amount of coins they would effectively nuke the price of the forked coin and could make the argument that they are increasing the underlying value of the ETF.
If there is no economy moving with the fork, then its a non-issue ---no? Deminimus would be defined. 
I would recommend changing 'discard' to 'Selling' the coin and issuing a dividend and possibly pay for general administrative expenses of the fund.
In any case the ETF must state how they will store and/or liquidate the forked coin etc.

"There are now no restrictions on the types of properties that foreigners are allowed to buy in China, and they can buy through an agent or directly from the developer or owner. Foreigners need to have worked or studied in China for more than one year to buy a property in China."
"Under the 1982 Constitution, urban land in China is owned by the State and the collectives own the rural land. Since the local and central governments administer the rural collectives, it can be construed that all land ownership is under control of the State. **However**, the Constitution's Amendment Act of 1988 to Article 10 adopted on April 12, 1988, states that a land use right may be transferred in accordance to law. Based on this statement, a land use right becomes divisible from land ownership, **thus making land use right likely to be privatized. Individuals,** including foreigners can hold long-term leases for land use. They **can also own buildings, apartments, and other structures on land, as well as own personal property."**

[0306] FIG. 32 shows two views 3200 and 3202 of a Curated App Rewards Store restricted to purchases with virtual currency or credit. In some embodiments, the Curated App Rewards Store does not require password entry before every purchase. As previously described, corresponding virtual currency can be obtained by purchase with real funds through the parent account's payment gateway. Once purchased, the currency can be disbursed by completing learning activities, or be rewarded to children upon progression or completion of tasks on the Chore List. Offerings in the Curated App Rewards Store may include some if not all the apps that would be available for purchase in the Curated App Store to this particular user profile. The Curated App Rewards Store provides simple categorization of games, apps, and music.

Something has to have value in order for it to be seized.  By seizing bitcoin they have officially declared that it is an item of value.

“…Products can be specified for which the token cannot be used to purchase. For example, a limitation upon the use of the token can specify that the token cannot be used for the purchase of alcohol or cigarettes. Rather than not allowing such items altogether, a limit can be placed on the amount of such purchases in a given time period. For example, $20 worth of beer and $10 worth of cigarettes can be purchased in one week…”

To be fair: via Mastercard:  Bitcoin Makes the Big Time—Journalistically Speaking
Theodore Iacobuzio | May 8, 2013
Anybody with an interest in the future of payments must read the Wall Street Journal’s interview with the lead software developer for the virtual currency, Bitcoin.
It’s easily the best piece to appear so far—Payments Perspectives blogs excepted, of course—on the subject of the stateless currency. The developer, Gavin Andersen, is bright and engaging, and goes right to the heart of the matter: what makes Bitcoin special is that it’s untethered from any government.
Of course, there’s always Warren Buffett’s 89-year-old partner Charlie Munger, who characterized Bitcoin last weekend as “rat poison”.
But read the Journal piece, it’s long and worth the time.
