Oh they soon will, this is only the start though; first the investment institutions will fold, then the walmarts and amazons of the world, and finally, your jobs. They'll start offering you the choice of pay through crypto, or your countries inflammatory fiat monopoly money. Who do you think people will choose? The dying worthless replicatable monopoly money? or the growing secure unreplicatable digital currency? That's when stability and steady growth will increase, as every federal note of any countries currency is automatically flushed into crypto by the companies that pay us; they'll be made to switch it for us so they can pay us in crypto when we choose to do so, then an ever green flow of all the worlds currencies and assets will go into the future of currencies; 5 quintillion in a US dollar value, all free falling into the market. Anyone know what 5 quintillion divided by 21 million is? We might not see it in our life time, but then again maybe we will. One thing is for certain, if you hodl even one bitcoin for your grandkids to use, those lucky little fucks will have almost 50 million dollars in value at their disposal.

What is it?

That's what I'm doing now. I'm sure future me will appreciate me living a normal life rn so he can live a crazy one later. I make enough now to live luxuriously but what would be the point if I was screwing over future me? Rather not make the same mistake I made when I was partying it up in 2010. That past me screwed current me, I won't screw future me.

Ohh, I know what your talking about. Had a friend try to get me into that shit, I was like why don't I just use the money I'd use for that to buy crypto? I never believed in renting, not my car, not my house, not my bitcoin mining.

This is true, it's one of the things I liked about my parents country, like the land they own in Mexico, no taxes ever owed for the property my dad inherited.
