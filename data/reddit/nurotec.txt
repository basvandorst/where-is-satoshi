Hey so at first most comments are not  very serious.  
1. The value of bitcoin is based on nothing but the amount somebody is willing to pay for it. Same goes for all currencies but since countries are usually try to hold a balance you don't see so much movement.  
2.  Currently bitcoins are mostly a speculative asset. People are betting that it will raise or fall with special investment tools(  shorts/longs/futures) those are in general risky, others buy and hold. Or buy low and sell when the price is higher.  Then they hope that the price goes down so they can buy back again. The last one ist most likely the best way for beginners the the risks are limited.  
3. The price of bitcoin was once  0.001$  and and was 1200 $ at its peak. Some belive it will crash and be worth nothing others belive that a single bitcoin one day will be worth 30000$ so if you are not into trading you can just buy a bitcoin and hold it may be you loose the money maybe it makes you richer. 
4. If you trade never invest money which will hurt you if you loose it. This is speculative and risky. Always be prepared for the worst. It will save you sleepless nights. 
5. About the stability.  This is a young tool I told you about the range. And we are right now in a relatively stable phase. But things can get messy or at least strange relativly easily. 
6. If you want to pay with bitcoin the use  price you pay in the shop will be converted into the price of bitcoins at the exact moment of your purchase.  Long term stability will be usefull for this. But right now it is almost completely about spekulation.
