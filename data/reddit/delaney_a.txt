The easiest **safe** method, since unfortunately PayPal is nowhere near as difficult to game as bitcoin is, is to [turn the bitcoins into cash first]( and then deposit to your PayPal acct.  So many bad stories from people who tried to do the BTC-&gt;PayPal transfer directly and got burned, as corporate policy is to decide against the bitcoin user in case of dispute.

Yes, plus they can convert the BTC into fiat for [&gt;10% over market value pretty much anyplace](  Actually businesses are perfectly set up to sell bitcoins as well, since most of them have business checking accounts that permit cash deposits in large quantities and are more secure.  Do this a few times and they'll never have to worry about volatility again.
