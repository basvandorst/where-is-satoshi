Your Greek analogy isn't right, we're not taunting enemies and bitcoin isn't a Trojan Horse.

I wouldn't call it blind optimism. A lot of us believe that bitcoin (or some alternative) is akin to any new technology that has come into the world. There was a point in history where buying a radio seemed pointless as there were so few broadcasters. "What's the point of radio? There's nothing to listen to." Despite that the believers invested in radio manufacturers and radio broadcasting. The steam engine, the telephone, electricity, cell phones, cars...look around you, every major innovation in history has had its naysayers and critics.
I look at bitcoin and see something that may one day be ubiquitous and mundane. At worst I'm just wrong (that's fine), not blindly optimistic.

He made it a secondary point but the longer record times are the key reason why VHS won over Betamax. As he pointed out, very early there were no videos to buy or rent anywhere, the *only* purpose to buy one of these machines was for recording.
Betamax is often cited as a superior product that lost to an inferior one but geeks and engineers are using a different criteria. To the consumer, the longer recording time of VHS made it superior.

The possibilities seem endless, a series of questions that if answered correctly would be the seed for a private key, a custom app would automatically sweep the private key at home. Multiple choice questions that you pay to answer, the funds from people that answered incorrect would then go to the people that answered correctly. You could still have participants as in a regular game show but now they're also being helped or hindered by the audience at home who have a stake on in whether he/she is correct or incorrect. They could be trying to influence the topic or the difficulty of the question etc. As far as I know, prizes for puzzles are not considered gambling, that's why we so often see "Fill in the ____ for a chance to win..."

I've held bitcoin for a year...you're amazed I'm optimistic?
Take a seat sonny and let me fill you in on a few things you need to know. You see the naysayers and haters aren't new to bitcoin, they've been there since day one.
"It has no intrinsic value."
"It's too volatile."
"If the price is going to go up why would anyone spend bitcoin?"
"It's too difficult to use."
~~"It's too difficult to get any."~~
~~"There's no where to spend it."~~
...there's more of course but you get the point.
You're unoriginal, you have nothing to bring to the discussion that hasn't been rehashed over and over and over and over again. It's not your fault though, you have no way of knowing this, how could you? You see the haters and the naysayers are like cockroaches in one respect, as soon as we hit a new ATH they scatter back to from whence they came. Unlike cockroaches however, they stay gone until a brand new batch arrives fresh from the sewer, as repetitive and unoriginal as the last batch.

Allow ranchers in Africa to be secure in their property and own the land they work. Bring the ivory market into the light of day and stop making it illegal.  African ranchers will have every incentive to preserve and cultivate their rhino stock if they are allowed to profit from it. 
There is still a need for security in this scenario but who better to protect rhinos than ex-poachers? I expect the majority of them would much prefer steady employment over a very risky and inconsistent income. The people funding helicopters would find it cheaper to buy ivory on the open market.
Making something illegal increases the risk *and* the reward but it does not stop people from doing it, you can buy drugs in prison. Making something legal removes violence from the market, see Amsterdam and Portugal.

The number of bitcoins is increasing by 25 every ten minutes. Econ 101 tells us what an increase in supply does to the price.

We are approaching "blood in the streets", this is when little guys unfortunately hand their money over to big guys.
Whether or not 500 holds I can't say for sure but if it doesn't I'm guessing institutional money will start buying at 450, right when even a few die hards are beginning to fork over their coins.

Absolutely, there is far more mining activity at the moment than the bitcoin economy warrants. At the moment.


Agreed but Swanson failed to envision what happens when ASICS are almost as cheap for the man on the street as they are for mining operations. Right now having access to ASICS is the biggest competitive edge in mining, *then* power and cooling costs come into consideration. If the specialized chips used in SHA256 hashing catch up with modern chip manufaturing processes and scales then the biggest advantage in mining will be cheap power. However it doesn't matter how cheap they can get this power, anyone running a smaller operation with the same cheap power that doesn't require industrial cooling will have an edge over large operations. In otherwords, when thermodynamics is the biggest hurdle to mining, SHA256 hashing will meet *dis*economies of scale.


I think this is recognized, gold has been used as a currency very rarely. As a store of value however (another function of money), it has a six thousand year history.


This is somewhat putting the cart before the horse, the tribes Swanson mentioned earlier that traded through barter would not suddenly become wealthy by employing futures contracts. I would suggest that production leads to financial instruments, not that financial instruments lead to production. I would like to learn more about this as there is definitely a feedback loop.
Many of my fellow bitcoiners do indeed make a purchase with bitcoin and then instantly rebuy bitcoin under the belief that this helps the bitcoin economy, I argue that consumer adoption is what counts the most, not merchant adoption. With that said, I would like to see the author buy a pair of shoes from Iran trying to use dollars, or calculate the foreign exchange fees when buying from an international vendor. There are some cases where using bitcoin and then repurchasing from Coinbase make sense.
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:22:16
Ever heard of a Swiss wallet? Many people in Europe were accustomed to dealing with multiple currencies and were even savvy enough to purchase items priced in different currencies that offered the best deal. In poorer parts of the world it isn't unusual to see two or three  prices on an item for local currency, US dollars, neighbouring currency etc.
People are fairly adept at gauging purchasing power, we know how much a hundred bucks should buy without much effort. There is room in our pricing ability for multiple currencies, multiple currencies is actually the norm for most people today and through history, not the exception.

Uncertainty and negativity seems to be in full force lately, I find it very intriguing. If these things really do move in cycles then we must be close to the nadir. I'm not very familiar with these things though, just one bitcoin "bubble" as an observer and one as a holder.
I'm not sure about the mechanics behind it, at first I thought it was news driven but there seems to be a bias as to which news has meaning based on where we are in the "cycle". Bad news bears more weight than good on the down slope and good news bears more weight on the up slope.
The number of trolls, haters and naysayers in this subreddit is truly staggering. They seem to be an indicator just as sure as novelty account like ToTheMoonGuy. I expect them to vanish on the up slope just like the last batch. It's a shame because I get a childish pleasure out of telling them "Fuck you because my ROI."
We've witnessed bitcoin take some serious blows lately but from my perspective the fact that it's at $550 is a serious testament to its resilience. If a technology this young, this cumbersome, this insecure and this contentious is just a fad that is going to die off then what on earth does it take to kill it?

Why are computers getting cheaper but bread is getting more expensive? Are we *worse* at making bread than we were 20 years ago? With technology we can look at that industry and say that our ability to produce electronics has improved faster than the rate of inflation. I know that things like flat screens and SSD's get cheaper over time. Clothing doesn't.
Technology isn't the only sector in our economy, since 1970 we have had a computer revolution, an internet revolution and forty million women have entered the work force yet now it takes two wage earners to raise a family of two but in 1970 it took one wage earner to raise a family of four.

People often put the cart before the horse on this one. Bitcoin can only be a currency if it is viewed as an asset first, all currencies are assets but not all assets are currencies.

It's the kind of stuff that will cause it to rise again in the future. Though the price is absolutely affected by news there are times when any good news will cause a price increase and bad news will have no effect. There are also time where the opposite is true. 
In short, news often affects price but at times all news is good news or all news is bad news.

Are you really this dense? You think you're the first critic, hater and naysayer about bitcoin? *Every criticism you can level at Bitcoin has been repeated a thousand times.* Including criticisms you can't even level at it anymore "There's no where to spend it, what can you even buy with Bitcoin?"
You're new at this so let me fill you in a little, this isn't the first time sentiment around bitcoin has been low. This isn't the first time people have dedicated *scary* amounts of energy towards a technology they don't believe will succeed. You have predecessors that you know nothing about. The reason you know nothing about them is because they stopped posting here in November last year. Then here comes you in what? January? February? You show up and it's like the last batch never even left because *it's the same old tired shit*. You're not clever, you're not novel, you're a clone.

It depends on your expectations, the price of bitcoin doesn't need to be high if it's only used for internet gambling or drugs etc. By those criteria bitcoin is already a success. Many of us though are struck by the world changing potential of Bitcoin and hope to see that come to pass. Price is a reflection of demand and if Bitcoin is going to be a world changing technology demand will increase dramatically.

I'm not saying Rockefeller was a saint or that he wasn't competitive or even underhanded. You're still missing the key point. Rockefeller, the man some claim is the richest man to have ever lived, could not monopolize the commodity he specialized in. *The richest man that ever lived could not gain a monopoly*. Standard Oils market share fell from a high of 95% to 60% *before* being targeted by anti-trust laws.

I don't know where the fear of "other people" comes from but you encounter strangers all day every day. No one is afraid the guy behind him in line wants to cut his throat but whenever we apes consider "society" all of a sudden all of humanity is just one law away from all out slaughter. It would be funny if the results weren't so damn horrible.
Try and convince a libertarian that the people of Iran are an enemy and a threat to the "free world", you can't, that's because libertarians have seen through the ape think and understand that "society" is made up of people that prefer peace and plenty over conflict and privation.

It's true, with the exception of serious miners and very early miners, the best returns on bitcoin have been made holding bitcoin. All we can really know from this though is that many investors have undervalued bitcoin as is, without further development. If all development and improvements to bitcoins infrastructure ceased today it might not mean the price of bitcoin will be less in one year than it is now. This is why I liken bitcoin to an undiscovered element suddenly introduced to the world out of nowhere and that people aren't sure is useful or not, we really are in uncharted territory here. It's damn near impossible to gauge its value today because we don't know how many people will want it tomorrow.
We all know that exponential growth can't last forever though.


This is where we'll disagree, it's true I might not invest in a website but I will want to take profits. Let's say (unrealistically) I'm making ten percent a year on my bitcoin for the rest of my life. Does that mean I'm never going to spend any bitcoin and realize any gains? I'm just going to sit there counting my wealth and planning my world trip for a time when I'm not making gains? I'd die before I got any where.
It's important to realize that saving for consumption in the future comes at a cost, that cost is denying yourself consumption today. A great example that backs up my claim is something we're all familiar with...technology getting cheaper over time. Technology is one industry where we have seen huge innovation and growth yet prices have consistently held steady or decreased over time. Consider flat screen televisions, smartphones (cellphones in general for that matter), computers, video game consoles etc. etc.
What do we see on release dates for exciting technology? People camping outside stores so they can be the first to get it. I do this too, early last year I bought a Solid State Drive *knowing* that if I waited a year I would be able to get it cheaper, the cost of having one now was less to me than the cost of not having one for a year.
Right now, I don't consider bitcoin deflationary in any economic sense, I consider it as a new asset with limited supply and increasing demand. If ever a time comes when bitcoin can *truly* be called a currency I do not fear deflation then as fears of deflation are mostly bogeymen when it comes to sound currency. Deflation is absolutely devastating to debt based currencies but I see that as an argument against debt based currencies, not an argument for inflation.
If you're still not convinced look at the period after the US civil war and before WWI in America, it is the fastest increase in human standards of living the world has *ever* seen yet prices plummeted during this time and it all occured under hard currencies.

A logarithmic chart displays exponential growth as a straight line instead of a curve. This is useful because large values can hide meaningful information. For example a change in price from $10 to $20 is 100%, a very significant change, but it would only appear as a tiny blip on chart that has values in the thousands.

At some point it will become more profitable to sell the chips rather than mine the coins and then we will see a greater distribution of mining. It's a new market right now with a greater incentive to use ASICS for yourself rather than sell them but once running costs hit equilibrium with profits there will be more money in selling cheap chips than using them for mining. I'm not sure what the end game looks like though, obviously it doesn't make sense that every one in the world could just turn on their computer and make money.

Actually they were very clever to let prices get so high. Instead of taking one million orders and accumulating a massive back log while the manufacturing was still being developed they sold less units at a higher price. If they had kept the price down by now there would be a few thousand upset redditors demanding an update every thirty seconds and screaming scam. Now that production is underway they can focus on improving ouput and bringing down the price.

The day I'm waiting for is the day bitcoin hits mass adoption with just one sector of society that has lousy banking and lousy currency. I'm talking about the people that already have contempt for their governments and disregard the laws imposed on them in regards to trade.

It might "hurt" the video game economy yet it is thriving. The argument against deflationary currencies is that all investment and consumption will degrade into a deflationary "death spiral." Time preference, if you understand it at all, shows us that people will consume when the cost of delaying consumption outweighs the benefits of deferring consumption.
As we can see with video games some people do defer consumption until later but we also see people lining up *for a week* just to get their hands on the latest console. If people were correct about deflation, none of them would be there.
There has been no "death spiral" for flat screen televisions, smartphones, computers or gaming consoles, they have been the largest sectors of growth for years yet they are deflationary.

Not quite, right now ASIC improvements are outpacing Moore's Law but eventually they will catch up to modern chip manufacture processes. At this point all the biggest gains in design that can be made will have been made, the industry will change from making *faster* chips to making *cheaper* chips.  This is where the miners will meet "diseconomies of scale". 
Imagine you're a chip manufacturer running a mining bank of 100,000 chips and you just completed making another round of 1000 chips ready to be installed but before you fire them up you run some numbers and find that the expected return of running these chips until they fail will net you a 3% return on the cost of making the chips. Then you look at the retail market and find that you can expect to make a 5% return on the cost of making the chips by selling them to others. This is the point at which wider distribution of hashing power will begin.

It would only be the marginal miners that drop off of the network and other miners would switch off their marginal units but a 50% cut in the block reward wouldn't necessarily result in a 50% reduction in hashrate.

I just shared a very similar sentiment with CNNMoney-
Q. Have you lost faith in Bitcoin?:  
A. No. I am unabashedly one of the bitcoin "True Believers". My perspective is that the world is desperate for a technology like bitcoin, it just doesn't realize yet. Bitcoin isn't the first technology that wasn't packaged complete and ready for the world to see its full potential. Pick any advancement in technology that you wish and you will find skeptics and even opponents to its advancement. I'd bet the first person that attempted to harness an ox to a plow was ridiculed. Governments and the church hated the printing press, steam engines were to prone to failure, no one would want a home computer and the internet is just an advanced fax machine....look at any major invention that you wish and you will find critics and naysayers. Bitcoin or some alternative, or alternatives, will one day be as mundane and widespread as radio but long before that day arrives there are going to be many, many days that are far more dramatic than the day Mt Gox closed. This isn't knitting frames or buggy whips after all, this is money.

It's got to be hard for the people Goxed, the Gox posts just can't go away until the status of the coins is known with certainty. Karpeles has a lot to answer for by keeping people in limbo like this, it's despicable.
 For those that were Goxed could I suggest perhaps starting a subreddit for the issue in the mean time? The Gox theories and investigations are completely understandable but we're already starting to see the other half of the community begin to lash out against Gox threads dominating the front page. Can we skip the inevitable drama and solve the problem before it becomes a problem?

It's a common belief that price movements have to have a known and identifiable reason but most of the time the best answer is to shrug and say "I don't know. People buying?"
Less sophisticated "analysts" will see a price movement, look for corresponding news and not finding any will claim "market manipulation". 
The truth is....someone started buying big and then other people started buying (this also works for selling). It's not a very sophisticated answer but 99% of the time it's going to be accurate.
This isn't to say that news never impacts price but even then I would say that in most cases sentiment drives news not the other way around.

This is where Murray Rothbard shines brightest, his book "What Has Government Done to Our Money?" is a fantastic introduction to monetary theory, banking, fractional reserve banking and central banking.


Gold has a six thousand year history as money, you can't learn much about money without learning *why* gold became money. It's like trying to learn about flight but ignoring wings.
Alternately Rothbard has another book, "The Mystery of Banking." and though it takes a closer look at banking and is often recommended I haven't read it myself.

No but we're seeing things from a different perspective. Wild and sexy experiments like Bitcoin don't challenge my belief in free markets, rather mundane small things confirm that belief every day. When you hear "free market" you might think crypto currencies but I think...bread.
But don't laugh...the process that gets bread on the tables of millions of people every day is wondrous beyond comprehension or imagination. The more you learn about it, the more you realize that no intelligence on the planet could improve on it.

Deflation doesn't occur without reason. Consider what deflation represents (from an Austrian perspective), it's an increasing number of goods being traded for a relatively static amount of currency. Under these conditions the investments had to occur in order to produce the extra goods in the first place, without investment, there can't be deflation. 
It is the investment of capital that causes deflation *in the first place*.
If all investment ceased because of deflation then deflation itself woud cease. If deflation ceased then investment would once again be an attractive means of making a return.
These very early days of bitcoin don't represent what would occur if bitcoin became a global currency. It is more apt to think of bitcoin as a brand new commodity (although digital) that has been dumped on the world for the first time. Demand has been increasing at a far greater rate than supply since its inception but if we are speaking of a time when bitcoin has reached a far greater level of saturation then concerns over deflation vs investment become moot because you can't have one without the other.
EDIT: "Than" to "then".

Arbitration is typically the word I use in these conversations, we started with the word court so I stuck with it. Often people back out of prior agreements to arbitration and go to government courts because the cost of government courts is so much higher the party they are in a dispute with will settle instead of defend themselves. Arbitration companies can come to a finding in weeks, government courts can take years.
Private security agencies would handle investigations and either determine guilt themselves or ask a third party to confirm their suspicions...I don't know. That video is very pertinent to this conversation if you should get a chance to watch it. There's every reason to believe there would be great economic and personal repercussions for punishing an innocent person. Again as far as punishment goes your guess is as good as mine.


If I own property downstream of your waste I have every reason to seek damages and see to it you pay for damage to my health and property. As do all the other property owners downstream of you. My protection agency would negotiate with your protection agency or they would go to an arbitrator to determine how much you should pay. Before you ask yes, if you do hire a protection agency it does have an economic incentive to negotiate a settlement when one of its clients pollutes someone else's land...

Locking millions of people in cages for victim less crimes and hearing jokes about the rape that they suffer. Prison rape is real but haha don't drop the soap.

Seeing my money taken away for providing something useful to the world and then used to bomb weddings and funerals. Children are getting blown to bits but oh well, that's just collateral damage.

When I speak of private courts I'm speaking of dispute resolution between two parties over who owns what and who is entitled to what not necessarily determining guilt and punishment for acts of violence.
How murder is handled today is probably a good indication of how it would be handled in a free society...People of Europe tend to look disfavorably on capital punishment for example but people of Texas tend to favor capital punishment. Punishment for murder would be a reflection of the society you live in...we'll never live in a utopia where everyone agrees to everything.
As for establishing guilt I would expect a private court or police agency to have far more incentive than modern police and courts to get it right. Unlike government agents of today *everyone* in a free society is held responsible for their actions and unable to hide behind a badge or a set of black robes to justify the wrongs they commit.

If the number of new bitcoin users remains the same but supply halves it would have an impact but I would say it's priced in even this early in the game.

3. The Chinese people have already been subsidizing our lives because of the Chinese governments economic and financial policies. They deserve to benefit from their labour as much as anyone else.

Peter Klein is spot on when he says the problem isn't the state but statism however I think something like Bitcoin can *demonstrate* that a hard and uncontrolled currency would be hugely beneficial. He did mention specifically Western Nations but that still leaves billions of people that have no illusions about the "benevolence" of capital controls, the benefits they stand to gain from Bitcoin are far more exciting to me than the benefits for people in developed economies.

I'm not talking about a new chain.
Don't get stuck in bitcoin think, there's other ways to be secure, private and instant as Open Transactions is working on. As things are now Bitcoin isn't suitable for stock or bond exchange but neither is physical gold. If you think of bitcoin as the "money" an exchange could issue an instant currency 100% *backed* by bitcoin and though this exchange is fully auditable publicly ensuring that 1 "Beetle" is issued for every 1 bitcoin (for example) the "Beetle's" themselves will be fully private, secure and instant. This function is *complementary* to bitcoin and adds to usability. A high volume stock exchange could function very well on Beetle's in this example, without wondering if your buy or sell order is going to take, ten or twenty or thirty minutes to complete.

I look forward to this service but I would require the following - 
1. A panic switch held by the company in case of a government crackdown or raid. The switch would send all bitcoins to a backup wallet held by the customer. Governments may be a bigger threat than hackers.
2. A vault fee sans insurance for transactions in and out of the wallet, not a monthly fee for insurance. Or at least that option.
3. One wallet per customer with the public key known to the customer for "watch only" purposes and deposits.
4. Greater options on the time range for cancellation. 
Location is key, I just wouldn't be able to use this service if it's based in the US, they will consume the last drop of honey from the last pot before they're done, unfortunately there really is no good place. Bitcoin needs a Switzerland, this might happen as that Switzerland will benefit greatly.

There is no scenario in which bitcoin doesn't encounter volatility while it's getting established. I just don't know how you could imagine that it will be predictable or steady for the immediate future. While this severely impacts bitcoins use as a *store of value* as long as it can be exchanged quickly for a unit of any stable currency then it will succeed. As more and more people start using bitcoin volatility will decrease to a much more manageable level.
I don't know what's in stock for the future of bitcoin but I can tell you one thing, it won't be smooth and steady.

The contrarian view is honestly the best gauge of bubbles.
How do we know gold isn't a bubble? All the talking heads and people on the street are saying gold is a bubble.
How do we know bitcoin isn't a bubble (not that it isn't prone to volatility). Everyone is afraid it is a bubble.
When every man and his dog is saying that bitcoin isn't a bubble because of factors xyz blah blah it's time to worry.
If you find yourself scorning a small minority that is warning of a bubble it's time to reassess.

NXT is not just another blockchain copy cat, it doesn't require mining. 
There are two major hurdles for me to get excited about NXT, it *is* pre-mined. The coins all belong to the 71 people that poured bitcoin in to the "genesis block". It is also closed source atm, this is to prevent copy-cats according to the devs.
I don't own nxt and won't be buying any until it is open source and a little better understood but I won't be dismissing it either. It is fundamentally different than bitcoin, though that doesn't mean it will be better it does mean it will be worth examining.

Economics just doesn't work that way, does it make sense that in this super productive world 20% of the people will still be working forty hours a week and retiring at 60? When one need is fulfilled, we seek to satisfy the next most ~~desirable~~ urgent need. In wealthy countries this means entertainment and art industries, in poor countries this means once your belly is consistently full you can send your child to school instead of to the field.
There is no scenario in which we are productive enough to feed and entertain the worlds population but there is only enough work to keep 20% of the population employed. It just means people will work ten hours a week and retire at forty (random numbers). It also means there will be some new and novel industries that can not be supported at todays level of wealth.

Yes, it's quite easy to generate your own wallet. If you don't intend to transfer or spend your bitcoin regularly I recommend an offline wallet. If you do intend to keep some accessible you are at greater risk of having your private key accessed by a hacker. There's no great solution here, there are online wallets but their servers are subject to hacking as well. If you want to use an online wallet the most trusted would be blockchain.info. If you want to have the private key only on your own computer the two most used and recommended wallet clients are Armory and Electrum. Unlike QT you will not need to download the entire blockchain to use them. I would recommend a linux install or purchase a mac if what you want available is a significant amount. bitaddress.org is the simplest solution for generating an offline wallet but Armory and Electrum can be used, it is just a more complex process.

I'm thirty three and remember the rise of the internet.
The first time you heard about it, it seemed like an esoteric past time for uber computer nerds, which were few and far between back then.
Then there was all this confusing terminology, like **e**mail, it's been a long time but that was a strange term once, hypertext (ooooooo), world wide web, search engines (wtf is a "search engine?"), even the term "internet" was strange.
Parallels might be blockchain, Bitcoin, nonce, proof of work, mining etc.
Any time talking heads on tv spoke about it the question was *always* "Is it a past time for nerds or world changing technology?" Ring any bells yet?
Opinions abounded, there were plenty of dismissals and naysayers about the impact the internet would have. Krugman is on record for dismissing it as a fad in 1996 - quote "We just don't have that much to say to each other." Facebook, twitter, reddit anyone?
My first exposure to the web was in '94 I guess and really the big question after all the hype was still "What is it?" I thought it was cool but didn't really see what all the fuss was about, mind you this was a twenty minute demonstration in a classroom.
During all of this, there were those that insisted that the internet was going to change the world in dramatic and revolutionary ways. That sounded good but it wasn't completely convincing. Starting to sound familiar?
It was in '95 or '96 I got to sit down and use it, a friend of mine had connected me to a chat "room" where I spoke with someone over the tubes for the first time.
Mind blowing. I had never in my imagination considered that I might one day have a conversation with a complete stranger from somewhere as exotic and mysterious as Malaysia. Yet there I was. That might not sound all that exciting but our ability to perceive technology as miraculous one minute and mundane the next knows no bounds.
Of course back then you had to walk five miles in the snow to change websites, you kids these days don't know how good you've got it.

Bitcoin is of a huge benefit to people in modern economies but the really, *really* exciting thing is what bitcoin means for people in less developed parts of the world. People that have not only never had sound money but have never had access to banking, sound money *or* communications until now.
I can't wait to see what happens when they start using bitcoin.
These are people that have zero illusions about the "benevolence" of governments and capital controls, it won't matter to them that bitcoin is illegal any more than it matters to most westerners that have ever smoked pot that it's illegal.
Our lives and prosperity depend on markets, the history of civilisation is a history of trade. We have seen over and over and over that when our survival depends on it markets go underground and the laws of the overlords are just so much wind.
Capital controls are already in the Western world but they are going to get worse, much worse. When that happens the rewards for breaking the law will outweigh the risk for more and more people. This establishes a feedback loop in which the ever greater numbers of people doing what they have to decreases the risk and increases the reward. Crypto-currencies will lead the way.

I swear to christ I don't how people can spend so much energy looking for ways to avoid spending energy, lazy people are the hardest working people in many ways, they spend *all* their time hating their job, watching the clock and looking for a way to do less.

Computers prices aren't "depreciating", they are subject to deflation, specifically "price deflation". Keynesians predict "monetary deflation" if "price deflation" was widespread. "Monetary deflation" is typical during the bust phase of the business cycle, "price deflation" *should* be typical of things we get better at making or providing. 


We (humans) have been getting better at making computers faster than the rate of inflation. That's why they get cheaper while most goods get more expensive.

I felt like dancing in the street when I learned about OT, it has potential that exceeds that of BTC yet it is a *perfect* complement to BTC. My tepid attempts to explain it have shown me that its potential is not as obvious as I believe it is. Thankfully Fellow Traveler himself found this thread.

I keep saying this to those with an austrian bent that dismiss bitcoin.
The only thing you need to know is that bitcoin is valued. You don't need to know why, you don't need to know how it happened. If you believe the best commodity suited to being money will emerge as money then bitcoin will one day be money. The only arguments I see from them today amount to "Bitcoin can't be money 'cause Menger said so." They don't even try and make a praxeological case any more, at least none that I can follow. The worst thing is they sound like Marxists, "You don't understand because you're not smart enough to understand". They just repeat weak appeals to authority *despite* empirical real world evidence to the contrary. They definitely lack the one trait I admire most in austrian economists, humility. They won't even consider that they might be wrong. It took me a long period of skepticism before I accepted bitcoin had potential, it was one of those rare "aha" moments in life but during the time I was unsure about bitcoin I was never arrogant enough to flatly declare "Bitcoin can't be money".

It's important to keep in mind that as the price of btc goes up the value of a Trezor does as well. There's more to launching a product than just making something for x and then selling it for x plus a little bit.
 It's not like they can produce 100,000 Trezors in a day so if they were selling them below whatever the market price is you still wouldn't be able to get one because of the waiting list unless you bought one on ebay, where you would probably be spending 1btc anyway...
 I'm glad the profits are going to the guys that made the product, this gives them the capital they need to increase production before lowering costs. It is very smart of them to ration the Trezors with high prices instead of building up a huge list of back orders.
If you *really* want a Trezor at least they are available, if you just want one but not at that price then you will have to wait on your schedule and not Trezors.

The narrative of modern day economists since the great depression is that deflation leads to less spending and investment. We can check this narrative for ourselves by looking at deflationary periods in history and looking at industries that are deflationary today.
First let's look at the period 1865 to 1914, the period after the US civil war and before WWI. This is actually the most exciting period in economic history (to me). While the developments aren't quite as sexy as the twentieth century like aeroplanes, radio, cars, telephones and so on it is a far more meaningful period for more basic needs. During this period people in the US saw truly *massive* gains in literacy, calories per hour of labor, life expectancy and things like clothing, light, heat etc. In 1865 it cost more than a days labor to buy a candle to light your home but anyone born in that year saw their grandchildren buying Model T Fords. 
This was all under a deflationary currency.
Today we constantly see the price of technology going down so if economists are right shouldn't we see no spending at all on technology because every knows it's going to get cheaper in a year? Look at the adoption of flat screen tv's. *Every one* knew ten years ago that they would get cheaper over time yet people continued to buy them and now they are ubiquitous. Smartphones are another example, we all know the iPhone will be cheaper in a few weeks yet people line up for the release. Video games, if you wait a month or two you can buy a video game for a very significant discount, on the night of release two months ago GTAV sold over $800,000,000 *on the first night*.
It's time to spell out why people spend under a deflationary currency..."time preference". We don't want to wait forever for goods and services. I'm not sure what your interests are but let's say you like video games and I'll make you a deal, I'll sell you a PS4 for $5 in the year 2018. There, now you have absolutely no incentive to buy one until 2018....except if you like games you probably don't want to wait until 2018 before you buy one do you? You see even though some things might be cheaper later, every day you don't have one is a cost itself. At some point the cost of not having one outweighs the benefit of waiting for a lower price.
Right well that covers consumption, what about investing?
While it's true there would be less credit available under a deflationary currency *this is a feature not a bug*. Credit was *easy* to obtain during the .com bubble, credit was *absurdly* easy to obtain during the housing bubble. You can expand credit forever under a printable currency. What this does is divert resources and labor into industries that can grow faster and larger than a hard money would allow, there are no brakes, there is no limit...until there is. You end up with more "investments" than our ability to produce can actually support. When it crashes the investments that are the least valuable and sustainable are abandoned, people lose their jobs and spending tightens.
Under a deflationary currency there will still be credit, if deflation is two or three percent (for example) but someone is willing to borrow at four percent then instead of a two or three percent increase in purchasing power you can achieve a six or seven percent increase by funding the loan. There will still be an incentive to lend and as long as the borrower believes his business or idea can achieve ten percent etc. What this means is that only the most *profitable* and therefore only the most *desired by consumers* industries receive credit. Credit will only find its way to sustainable and needed industries.
What will be undesired will be taking a loan out for *consumption* which is not a bad thing at all, while it's true that our time preference might desire a jet ski or an RV today at the cost of interest payments our ability to consume should reflect our ability to produce. Keep in mind that people will still borrow for consumption if their time preference demands "I have to have it now".
Here is a seven minute video briefly explaining the role of interest rates and lending according to Austrian Business Cycle Theory...
