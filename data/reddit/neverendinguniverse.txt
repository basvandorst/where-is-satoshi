Is that really true, though? Honest question... Monero offers anonymity, ethereum smart contract features, etc.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:42:16


Thanks for the reply. If nothing happens, isn't this a big problem because of increasing fees and transaction times? Honest question...
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:44:03
Is there any evidence that the halfening had a direct correlation with higher prices? Honest question, I'd love to hear more than opinions.
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:22:37
Say one has 1 BTC now, will you then get 1 + 1 or 0.5 + 0.5?
That's not ideal, of course, either way. How do you know which one to keep or drop, since one will win. It sucks.
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:14:19
when you say "oad up on unforked BTC" do you mean buy the current bitcoin? What happens at a fork, do we own both?

Hi, bitcoin.tax looks great. What privacy and security implications does using your service have? How much information do I have to share for the SaaS to work as intended? Thanks
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:03:01
That's an interesting answer. Can I ask: What's your biggest annoyance or inconvenience right now with buy/selling, paying, connecting? 
Something like Coinbase seems easy, are there issues with it you don't like?
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:41:10
I think you're spot on, buy and hold. May I ask: Why 2020? Is that based on something specific or do you only mean long run? Is it the halfening (previous ones had little direct correlation with price increases, no)?
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:02:57
That;s fun. Venmo is free (no idea how they make money to sustain the app) so I wonder how a Venmo for Bitcoin would keep the lights on, too.
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:46:41
Do you think it's needed for faster transactions, because it's cheaper, or for other reasons?
@_date: 2017-03-09 05:09:45
That's fascinating. How would a decentralized exchange work in your view?
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:02:10
Interesting for sure. I wonder if existing laws in the U.S. would interfere with the last will idea. e.g. a blockchain will might not be enforcable because 1) a lawyer is legally required to create it (that's the case for prenups for example)
What role do you see insurance companies have and what do you mean by intangible assets? Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:30:59


What's that?
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:25:07
That's interesting - devil's advocate question: Isn't a major benefit of crypto the more or less anonymous transaction though? Why would people (or why would you) prefer connecting with friends (easy transfer)?
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:02:58
Cool, I love that thought. I think the biggest problem right now with mainstream people using this would be 
1) Joe Customer doesn't know what blockchain/bitcoin/crypto is and therefore wouldn't trust it
2) It's really complicated to move money from say USD which would be required to do e.g. recurring payments
What are your thoughts on that, would love to hear more about what you think.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:56:16
That makes sense.
I guess what I am asking is, there seems to be very little correlation between halfings and sustained price increases. They are disconnected at best, so what's the point of focusing on halvenings?
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:33:58
Thank you
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:46:56
you say:




I think is actually asking a smart question.
Let's say you're right and supply goes down from the halfening and that translates into price going up. Ok, fair enough. But that completely disregards DEMAND, which is a MUCH stronger force. People losing faith in Bitcoin, etc can completely override any supply side effects.
What evidence is there that, as you say:


Really asking, would love to find out..
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:26:56
Got it.  On-chain transactions would be amazing, but I am not sure how that could be implemented, if wallets and exchanges can't do it.
@_date: 2017-03-09 06:22:18
You mean other than Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-09 05:09:20
Makes a lot of sense
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:42:18
There are taxes in the country you live in. I was looking for a tool to prep reports for that and somebody recommended it.
Wonder if its good or bad...
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:03:53
Why won't there be a fork? Thanks
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:45:33
Yeah, that's an issue (unstoppable blockchain).
Check this out:
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:09:16
Fascinating. Could you elaborate a bit please? How do you see the instant transactions to work, ideally?
Don't exchanges and wallets already offer that (essentially) - almost instant and pretty cheap?
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:08:16
Super interesting, love your thoughts on this!
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:59:00
Thanks. Is Coinbase available in Germany?
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:38:31


Could you please explain why it's a tax advantage to use a Roth IRA for Bitcoin rather than a 401k?
Thanks for your help!

I created a live aggregator for my own use, you're welcome to use it too :)
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:40:56
Currently, to the best of my knowledge, buying alts looks like this:
Get Coinbase or similar account // Buy BTC or ETH // Transfer to another exchange like Poloniex or Bitrexx // Buy Alt Coins // Transfer again to wallet
That's a lot of accounts and steps. A service could offer all that management and you would simple deposit money and see your portfolio, withdraw any time.

@_date: 2017-05-23 18:52:40
No. I wish to solve one of my own problems, see above.
Edit: some more details for you. It's currently very time consuming to buy and hold the top 15-30 coins. I know, since I've done it. Many exchanges, wallets, and other steps are required - making it either impossible or very inconvenient for the average person to participate. This is normal in an early technology, but also keeps people from entering and supporting crypto. I don't like that inconvenience and would like to solve it for myself and others. I get the counter-party/middle-man issue and philosophically agree with you but there may still be a possibility that a trustworthy service could help. Anyways, just asking for opinions - thanks for sharing yours.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:08:38
I fully understand your point though, essentially one of the amazing things about crypto is to remove the middle man, so yeah there is a balance perhaps between that and convenience for some people?
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:15:14
This is great, thank you very much for putting the work in to write this!
@_date: 2017-06-24 00:45:53
That's incredible, great points. Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:26:53
That's interesting, but yeah, not really evidence. Still... pretty entertaining :)
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:29:12
You're misunderstanding. I am talking about scaling exchange capacity. There have been a LOT of outages, delays, and downtimes as demand grows.
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:14:38
I think that's a fair and balanced opinion. 
I stilll like Kraken and Coinbase, though the downsides are high fees, slow support, and no auto-diversification. 
Currently beta-testing this  which so far is fantastic. That's also the reason I'm totally shilling it on Reddit here, true believer I guess :)
TLDR: Maybe give Kraken another chance if you liked their service so far..
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:44:58
Could you elaborate why Yuri?
