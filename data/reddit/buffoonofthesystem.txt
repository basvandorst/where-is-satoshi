I don’t even give a fuck if that’s true, you convinced me with your confidence, Xir.

Thank Dog I’m a dogillionaire.

Just think, you could have bought at 19k.

Omg I’m going to become a BTC farmer in WoW Classic.

Welp guess I need to move.

We certainly did tire of looking at a “plywood” box...

Same. Keeps me buying.

It seems unlikely to be used as a heavily circulated currency when, at the moment, every transaction is a taxable event. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:46:07
It still seems inconvenient to spend and replace if every time you spend it’s a taxable event though, or am I wrong in thinking this?

ELI5 how this is related to a bull run?
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:43:21
“Something similar”

I set up automatic buying a few months ago. I basically don’t look at the price at all anymore unless someone I know irl says something about the price going one way or another. We’ll see how well this works out in a year I guess...
