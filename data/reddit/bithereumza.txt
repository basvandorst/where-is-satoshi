On CMC you can click on Markets, to see the price on all markets they pull data from, I believe the average price of all those markets is what you see on CMC.

It has hard to leave this country, it really is. I've personally been trying for the last 5 years. It's not only too expensive to leave, it's hard to start over and give up everything you've worked your ass off for.
I've already moved from a big city, to two different coastal towns, back to a big city to try and avoid getting robbed. It hasn't helped. Each time I made a moved it got worse. Each time. I. moved I through my life upside down.

I'm a java developer with around 13 years of experience, I definitely have the skills. don't u need qualifications in the US for that though?
I also assumed the new immigrant policies would make it nearly impossible for me to go there, the exchange rate also makes it difficult, i. e. what you pay for 1 cup of coffee can get me 10 here. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 02:19:56
You're right, It's funny you mention it - I do actually remember a similar story (grew up in Pretoria) and someone in the suburb next to ours blew himself up. I was still in primary-school though, so between 1994 and 2001 but I remember sitting in my house and hearing a loud thump noise - the window in my room was vibrating from it, I mum told me later the evening that someone had explosives in his house and committed suicide. Would be interesting to know if it was the same area.
Yeah, the squatters are ridiculous - about 2-3 years ago someone here bulldozed his house to sell it to a company to build apartments, he left the country for six months came back and there were shacks setup everywhere on his property, took him years to get the cops to get them to finally leave, it made our entire neighborhood look bad - they trashed pretty much everything. Eventually he did manage to get them out though. I'm guessing he had to handsomely grease the hands of some of the cops.
Yeah look, you're relatively safe in this country committing any type of crime, rape, murder etc. are all fine. There are only 2 crimes that you should never ever commit here and those are:
- pay your taxes
- pay your tv license
Skip one of those and you're in for years of pain.
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:32:11
Hey, sorry that is disgusting I agree, personally I haven't seen it anywhere in the news or actually heard of it happening anywhere.
Please do not get me wrong, I believe our country is a shit hole too, I've been through my own pains, but I also know that a lot of us tend to blow things out of proportion and make it seem worse than it is. Obviously from what you just said that's not the case for you and I apologise.
Where did this happen though, in which province? I'm guessing it was not in Gauteng otherwise we would all know about it. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:05:07
sheesh, that's only about 2 hours away from me, wonder how I haven't heard anything about it anywhere.

We have this birth right thing, I'm not sure that's what it's called, but my grandfather came here from Italy and I can get citizenship ship and an Italian passport. The problem is I've been waiting months for my unabridged birth certificate which is a prerequisite and our government handles that, after I get that the rest is done at the Italian embassy, which should be a smooth process. but then it's the issue of money, plane tickets are expensive and you need a fund to keep you alive for a couple of months after you move until you can find a job. I'm assuming that not being qualified for anything would make finding a job hard too, so that fund needs to be a big one. 
The exchange rates are also problematic here, our money doesn't mean that much anywhere else, so saving up to move is hard. 
Moving around inside SA is obviously easier, I was just trying to make things better for myself, even if it was just a little. I cant tell you how sick I am of either being robbed or just being scared at night.
Yeah, I hear you, but in 1994 I was only 6 years old. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 01:57:05
no need to apologize I get it. employment was definitely my biggest concern, so I'm very relieved to here that. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 02:23:16
I know what you mean. People do have a right to safety and freedom. We live in prisons to try and keep ourselves safe. Nah, no "thumbs-up" to me; I'm rather miserable here, I'm working hard on a way out. I got some good tips today on making extra cash to get out.
I'm curious - if you don't mind sharing, where did you move to and how hard was it to get everything in order, visas - passports, finding a home and employment etc. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:38:20
yeah, there are universities here, but how do I goto a uni and study while I'm a full time employee?
That's good news though and thanks for responding, any idea where I can look for remote work?

Really, are you even reading, you were debating the fact that Coinbase’s Wallet is not a wallet, when it is. I am not saying not having access to your Private Key is good! Use your common sense, if you had your physical wallet in your house at the time you wouldn’t have access to that money either - would you? That doesn’t make your physical wallet a not a wallet. 
We aren’t saying that Coinbase has a good wallet or that is preferable over using a wallet where you have access to the private key!! Merely saying that is IS a wallet.
You should really really really really(yes one more really then you had), learn to read - because you are making a fool out of yourself.

@_date: 2017-11-23 03:02:45
I agree, Coinbase is not Bitcoin’s killer app, Bitcoin is - one thing I must say though, is that Coinbase allows normies to get involved without understanding even the most basic principals of cryptography, if it wasn’t for services like it my girlfriend wouldn’t have bitcoin today.
We just need something better and decentralized that’s easier to use - I just don’t know how to compete with someone as big as coinbase, who is literally paying $10 per signup for affiliates. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:18:24
And if the goverments police comes in arrests you and takes the wallet out of your pocket do u still have access to those usd?
Then your wallet is not a wallet.
No one is saying its a good idea to use the wallet or put all of your funds in it, but it doesn’t make it not a wallet.
EDIT: Changed policy to police.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:25:31
Well in my opinion you don’t waste development time on a fix that you do not believe is a permanent solution. Bitcoin for me has been synonymous with antifragility, why risk an upgrade to temporarily increase transaction volume on a chain that hasn’t reached mainstream adoption yet - I mean who today really gives a sh’t about buying coffee with bitcoin? At the moment its main use is transferring funds across borders, an investment or simply a store of value.
I’m not saying it’s all it’s supposed to be used for, I am just saying at the moment the majority of cash in the ecosystem isn’t traded like that. 
Just my opinion, I think they would rather try and find a different solution more future proofed, I mean if people really wanted an 8mb block why didn’t they buy BCH months ago and use it to pay for coffee.
I mean for me the two have different use cases, I would still rather keep my investment in BTC, because I believe the upgrades are safe, when I spend money I’ll use something else. Bank vs Wallet.

Payfast.co.za is a south african payment gateway that supports bitcoin, they have 33k merchants that accept bitcoin as a result - our biggest online retailer takealot(our version of amazon) supports it, and our biggest grocer (pick and pay) will accept bitcoin soon. I think our adoption is looking pretty darn good. Now if only I could earn enough BTC to spend it!
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:34:26
Ok bro, I take it back you are right, your physical wallet and coinbase wallet is not a wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:39:16
yes, like i said you are right bro, we are talking about bitcoin wallets, and we are also talking about  plastic fiat wallets and not the leather ones, just to be clear.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:44:36
Absolutely agree

I disagree, I believe Bitcoin should be called Bitcoin (not Segwitcoin and not Bitcoin Core and not Segshitcoin) and Bitcoin Cash should be called Bitcoin Cash (not Bitcoin, Bcash or Btrash). I believe cryptocurrencies are still in their infacy and at the moment the “smarter” herd is here, when dumb money enters and gets confused they will learn a lesson and not fall for the next Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Red or Bitcoin Yellow.

@_date: 2018-03-06 04:03:07
There is something here that isn't taken into account, playing a guess on the powerball costs alot more than playing a guess on a Bitcoin private key.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:20:22
The consensus was as far as I remember that it's primarily used as a store of value and due to the scaling issues on chain,  a offchain scaling solution like lightning would restore and improve it's ability to be used for common payments for everyone. The fact is that a 1mb block limit is not enough for the entire world to use it. That's a fact. So a solution like bigger blocks or offchain scaling is needed. Bitcoin chose offchain scaling and Bitcoin Cash chose bigger blocks. It's up to you to decide which you want to use. 
I don't understand though, if you don't want to use it at all, why are you here?
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:51:44
Well BCH has dropped more than BTC. additionally there is a war between CSW and Ver, neither of them are "core" supporters,so I honestly don't know what you're trying to say. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:21:10
Absolutely, I agree. If they manage to somehow kill BTC , which I highly doubt they will be able to. Then the people will have no choice (That's if it's even possible to outlaw a currency - right).
If these criminals can ban Bitcoin, they can ban other forms of trade too. I'm still optimistic on Bitcoin though and I don't believe governments can successfully kill it, but we shouldn't become complacent while they try.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:41:52

Old money won't go down without a fight, Bitcoin will be attacked in every conceivable way. The thing that's important is that we don't give up when the price crashes, that we HODL and that we spread the gospel!
A government controlled cryptocurrency would be bad, it's a simple way to eliminate all privacy by eliminating  cash - they will enslave us, we need to refuse and we need to resist. We need to stay strong and HODL. We were born at the right time to fight for this cause and create a better future for our kids. If we don't we will all have a bad time.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:11:26
The need for lightning isn't only for lower fees on Bitcoin. It's also for enabling micro or nano payments. Which is not currently possible anywhere else. Besides usage will increase with more adoption. When there is a huge number of people transacting again it will be needed.

The thing that annoys me most about this video is the fact that he claims he understands it fully without giving any proof of that claim, he just calls everything intricisies.
Absolutely nothing in this video made me feel like he truly understands the technology.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:56:36
Not entirely true, a cryptocurrency is defined as a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency. 
A government controlled decentralised cryptocurrency cannot exist. "Cryptocurrency" in itself by no means implies that it's decentralised.
Hell, a private bitcoin block chain with only one node is still a cryptocurrency, it's just centralised. 
We can argue about the definition if you like, but it doesn't matter - the point is that it will be attacked by all governments because it's a dangerous threat to them, the exposure that the public has will make them more susceptable for accepting a government controller digital currency (if you prefer this definition), one of two things will happen:
a) Bitcoin - or a deviation of it (i.e. 99.9999999% of all other decentralised digital/crypto currencies) will win.
b) We will all lose.
Thankfully, it will take a coordinated effort from all governments to effectively kill it, which would be *insanely* hard to pull off - the effort from mastercard/visa is a bit of a scare though - hopefully we get to the point where no one cares what they do, because merchants  will use BTC, or let's hope more merchants will stop accepting FIAT.

Well, I just spent cash on a hoodies, it was pretty awesome. The only bit I disliked was opening the channel, took over 30 minutes. I guess it's not bad if you open a channel once a month.
But damn once that channel was open it was impressive, it cost 0.05 ZAR to send 40USD and it was almost instant.
Ordered from bitcoinshirt.co. :)

in the same way as stock or currency and bitcoin is a currency depending on who defines it.
