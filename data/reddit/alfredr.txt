Adding on, there is no centralized registration of addresses. Private addresses are just random numbers and are generated off network.

It's designed to maximize the expense of the ASICs. Look at the table on page 14 for cost comparisons.
Basically the algorithm does so much random (i.e. non-sequential) memory access that you're more-or-less forced into a general purpose computer to implement it.

I agree with your initial point -- that changing the hash doesn't stop the 51% problem. 
But scrypt ASICs are hard. Scrypt is designed to require lots and lots of RAM and this greatly increases the required physical size of the scrypt circuit on silicon. Net, this means far fewer copies of the circuit on a single chip (thus lower hash-rate per chip, and much more expensive chips).
Further, Scrypt is a sequential memory-hard algorithm which makes it impossible to parallelize efficiently.
I'll quote the [scrypt paper]( on my way out


sequential memory-hard function takes twice as long to compute: As long as there
is enough random-access memory to compute the function on a general-purpose
system, doubling the time spent asymptotically results in the cost of computing
the function in hardware increasing
four-fold, since the time and required space are
both doubled.

Litecoin makes a poor choice of parameters. This isn't a problem with scrypt but a problem with Litecoin.
Going forward as GPUs become more general purpose (better at non-local memory access) they look more like CPUs. So in the long term GPUs are probably viable anyway -- the point is that low cost ASICs are out (with suitable choice of parameters) and you will need something more expensive.

Right - You need a suitable choice of parameters.

Right. I'm not talking about what coin is better, just about properties of hash functions my friend :)
