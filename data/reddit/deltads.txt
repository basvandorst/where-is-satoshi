How does one make sure this won't just stole your btc ?
@_date: 2019-07-28 11:26:32
I mean it is cool and stuff, but can't you accomplish the same thing with a cheap Android phone and a app?
I was just thinking, if someone deploy it and the vendor of the hardware someday drop the production of new units and I'm out of the possibility to build a new PoS of mine ever get broken

100k is actually good for Bitcoin in the long run

Most of people live paycheck to paycheck and don't have money to spare so doesn't matter if someone have the keys or you do, those who care already figured that out.
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:09:35

Even the hard way, we talking about what 6^9 (~ 10 million) iterations and checking if there is a valid private key in it ?

@_date: 2019-06-22 14:23:31
yeah, but the thing is that no one cares about surveillance or permission here anyway, if you do you wouldnt be posting in the clear-net. neighter would be printing your opnion on reddit.

@_date: 2019-06-22 14:20:56
dont do that, diversify on others assets, dont need to be crypto-only. Stick to the backup-theory: "if you have one - you dont have nothing, if you have two - means you have one"
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:52:22
Indeed, pretty easy to solve with brute force and couple hours of coding

Oh shit, here we go again
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:44:13
That is why we need to setup multiple HAM radios acting as relays so you can send a encrypted Morse code messages to all of them, they will be plugged to a raspberry pi's plugged in different ISP on multiple Geo locations with a software that can act as a proxy to the encrypted messages on the Morse code channel.

Ok, here me out, people don't use btc as a mean to make transactions, ppl hold btc as any other stock. I know the idea of btc is remarkable. But btc will not be the currency on point of sales, btc will be the gold. 
Normies just care if it work or not and if is easy to install. And btc is not this, Libra on the other hand already has the Messenger and WhatsApp user base, I'm happy about it? No would love to see normies use ng btc as It was intended to be, but 10 years in the future, none of us was able to build the killer app on Bitcoin.
As harsh as it can sound, we are the ones holding the key of Fort Knox and not the next "credit card".
And I don't know if people care if others know where and what they buy online and offline, most of us use our debit and credit card in a daily basis and the last thing that goes on our head is if we are been recorded on a database. So if I would guess, I guess people don't give a sh!t about privacy and other stuff.

So you are telling me if Marky himself DMed you and asked if you wouldnt join the party you would refuse because of a cypher dream ?

Back in my day we had to rely on DNA to pass genetic modification based on our environment and how fit we got to survive there
@_date: 2019-09-13 12:56:57
Probably because normies don't trust it enough yet

the point is, you do not need a Application Specific Integrated Circuits , to mine anything. Of course the hash rate is in the moon, but you wouldn't mine anything on 21 anyway.
IMO this a vendor lock-in just as the OP (mentioned
