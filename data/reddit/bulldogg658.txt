25k coins was $6.2 million this morning, fat cats fuck everything up. This is why I never feel so good hearing about the winklevoss twins. Had bitcoin just been average people it would probably function fine, but when you start attracting big money players that can throw around huge sums with no conscience, market manipulation is the name of their game and we go back to being crops for them to harvest.

Well if you say so, I suppose you know me best after reading a few lines on the internet. Though if I had had a say in this decision, I'd have said nothing in wealth appeals to me. The [self entitled cruelty](  that seems so popular these days. Manipulating peoples lives for a bigger return and looking down on them for it. All the while still worrying about higher dollar versions of the same stuff. I would have said that it's more valuable to me not to be that person, than any amount of money that could be offered. But then you've got a better view up there on your pedestal, you're probably right it's just shitty self esteem.

A lot of this is a coin toss. Warren Buffet has proven to be very good at guessing them but they're still coin tosses nonetheless. If you take investment advice from anyone, Buffet or Reddit, as anything other than an educated guess, you're doing it wrong.

I'd rather be broke than be part of the problem.

Dogecoin is like having Elmo be the spokesman for Mercedes-Benz. You're not garnering yourself a lot of credibility. Cutesie names and mascots are how you sell candy, not a word wide currency system that already has enough hurdles to jump.

You damn whippersnappers don't know what it was like back in MY day. I bought at $90 and it went to $1200 a few months later. You're gonna have to do better than $73 to rustle my jimmies, I'm still up 400%.

I got one for $100 in 2013. If I sold it even now it would cover my rent for a month, be gone, and I'd be heartbroken if it went really high. If it hit 2 or 3k I might consider it, but mostly I'll hold it as insurance so that if it ever does something crazy I won't have to say "god I wish I hadn't sold it back then." Until then it's still just $100 to me.

Bubble? I bought at $90 and a few months later it hit $1200. You young whippersnappers don't know nothin' 'bout no bubbles!

I don't know why you're getting downvoted. I won't touch TPB anymore. It got raided, went down for weeks, they publicly fired their staff... and then they magically came back up without a word. There are old pirates and there are dumb pirates, but there are no old dumb pirates.

I was about to go make a deposit at BOA for my first bitcoin with them, should I wait and see if it comes back to what mtgox is at?

I demand the backstory to this!

I feel like the publicity of these 2 is going to hurt the acceptance of bitcoin. And really, aren't these the type of people that bitcoin was meant to circumvent?

Wow thank you, you guys didn't have to do that. Don't mean to punish you for your generosity by asking questions now, but I hate to flood the sub with individual posts. Now that my wallet balance registers some amount... what exactly do I have? I mean, if I have a nickle, I have a little silver piece of metal that represents that. Is it just a unique string of numbers stored in the system that equates to this amount?

Would it be more secure to keep the wallet.dat on a flash drive and only put it back on your machine when you need to use it?

Unrelated question, but how would I convert it back to cash? Say I make a $100 deposit tonight and before I get home btc tanks and I want my money back rather than buy any. Or say I come home and buy a btc tonight and it jumps to $1000 and I want to cash out. What's the process for that with bitfloor?
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:27:47
Sorry I meant bitfloor, for the direct deposit you mentioned.

Additionally, how should your address list be organized?
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:32:09


When they handle 80% of transactions, isn't it, kind of?


A billion dollars of spending power disappeared overnight. I suppose it depends on what your definition of "compromised" is.

Thanks, reformats are nerve wracking enough, I wanted to be sure this one doesn't cost me $130 too.

Do I have a separate private key for each address, or is it 1 key that works across all addresses of mine? In which case, is using a paper wallet and you had a bunch of addresses, it seems like it would be easier to have all btc in one address rather than have to enter all of them. I mean, if I had $5 in one address and $10 in another, $20 in a third, and wanted to pay someone $35, I would have to enter all 3 addresses to make the payment, right?

I've got you res tagged from what you did for that headphone guy a few weeks ago, its good to hear you did well.
@_date: 2013-03-20 06:25:46
It doesn't cost to move it around does it? Other than the paranoia from bitfloor being hacked before, is there a reason I would rather have it in my app wallet or somewhere else rather than in bitfloor?
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:42:10
Thank you very much.
