Buy every dip and then never sell ever in your whole life is how you make the most money. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:29:30
I sold half at 4K, so yall are welcome. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:49:58
I had been DCA for awhile so I dunno, will just buy another dip and report this loss so I am actually happy. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 13:10:55
You ruined my sale at sub 4K sacrifice, asshole.
edit: /s for all these sensitive people. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:04:54
Whoa are you seriously suggesting I skip starbucks everyday? 
edit: good advice for serious people though

Oh my god I am a fool for buying btc! I am panicking and going to sell everything!! Why did I invest my rent money into this?!?!
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:58:21
It is and it isn't. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:50:06
What a great time to buy :)
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:26:09
You're an idiot. You should be ashamed after re-reading your own comment. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:47:17
Thanks dad!
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:24:13
lol! My lil homie who is a huge loser nerd HATES not only miners but those who invest or use btc as well. He always cries that videocards have skyrocketed in price.  I am gonna send this photo to brighten up his day.

I'm sure OP appreciates your judgement and two cents.  Did it occur to you that all that stuff might be taken care of and then some?
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:38:00
Hey was thinking about selling a few of my bitcoins, could someone tell me what the price is going to be next week?
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:35:23
I saw a lambo outside the valet at the mall just now, felt entitled to it. Finagled my way into the valet box when the kids were on a pot break and grabbed that lambo key fob. Happened to see a rich ass Persian dude walking up looking around for the valet. I casually strolled over and whistled for attention. "Hey, take care of her for me" I said as I tossed him the key to my lambo.

My bookmark to the price charts on my browser is stuck at 6338.00/btc. :(
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:49:17
I'm just here for the tech.
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:27:51
Tattoo the wallet address on their tummy. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:30:23
disable your vpn
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:01:14
Hell yes just bought some more at that sub 10K price
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:39:52
You just fucked up my head. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:44:44
11K is imminent. *crosses fingers* 
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:13:46
So it is and it isn't?
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:23:51
I just bought more for the hell of it. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:26:40
Try googling around for an ATM if you need it immediately. Credit one bank credit cards work but charge a cash advance fee, I have not had one over $5 and it is immediate purchase. Sometimes when you sign up for a CC they give you the info and you can purchase that day edit: I am talking specifically about coinbase here.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:50:29
You ain't too bright are ya fella?
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:29:12
Guys &amp; Girls, I think btc will do what it gone do today but maybe not. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:42:30
I'm not at all. 
Just the right tool and I'm sure they had it pried open in seconds. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:23:27
Double pay day today my glib globs!!
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:42:11
I knew I should have bought a little more at sub7K prices, but I am also glad I didn't because the price jumped. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:28:27
How do you think bitcoin will look next week? I am waiting for some funds to hit an account. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 16:07:10
Not true, you can only pay for illegal things with crypto on the dark web. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:12:38
This is great
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:26:42
What would you recommend for a free wallet? I want to keep it digital too, not write some shit down. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 23:19:54
Bro if you can't figure out that was sarcasm, you should hire an assassin off the dark web with btc to kill you in your sleep.
edit: or use fiat IDK
@_date: 2019-05-03 13:38:01
You get it.
