Show me the evidence.

Which is totally irrelevant. You are angry because trump won, but it was hillary's fault, not assange's. Hillary was an even worse criminal anyways.

I am not. Also I'm not reading your links.

No one is talking about that orange pig. You seem traumatized.
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:24:26
It is tho.
@_date: 2019-04-12 06:44:58
Did they lie about it? You realize how stupid your argument looks to any non american?

Just like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, right?
Bitcoin is valuable not because of idiots fomoing in, but because it is the reinvention of money in a sound, permissionless, censorship resistant form. Every time a country fucks up their monetary policy, Bitcoin is going to be there sucking in the value from people exiting the currency wars. These bubbles are just the massive redistribution of wealth from the first world middle class with get-rich-quick-mindset to the few people around the world who understand why to hodl.

So your whole argument is because less people heard about ethereum losing 95% of it's price, and more people heard about bitcoin losing 85% of it's price,ethereum will be the winner in the end?
State run cryptocurrencies are going to fail for the same reason state fiat currencies fail. It is because the monetary policy is subject to the whims of the state. Decentralized cryptocurrencies are neutral, that is why they are valuable.

Of course the yare bitter because they bought in at a very stupid time to do so. Just like the last 6 times the exact same thing happened. Tell me, what could take the place of bitcoin, other than another cryptocurrency? And can you name one that is not volatile and subject to manipulation, and fomo bubbles?
