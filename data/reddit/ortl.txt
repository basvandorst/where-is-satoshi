I'm trying to buy bitcoin to then try to buy other coins in other exchanges.  The desire to get a small amount is so I can finally take action - basically I've been waiting for verification on some of these sites for the better part of a week (basically since the 27th).  With the exception of coinbase which I started last Friday.
The month of December has just been me vacuuming up information about other coins, how exchanges work, etc.  I'm also fully aware of the fees associated.  Basically I'm looking for a fix to get me started.

Were you able to purchase any coins?  I was not.  It prompted me for ID verification.

I understand that.  But like I said, I'm in a state of pending verification on all those sites.  I'm getting the impression that verification isn't going to happen soon.  Unless you are talking about paxful.

I'm nearly 30, so I don't think it's my age.
At first I thought it was the quality of the photo.  My laptop's webcam sucks.  Coinbase allowed me to use my phone to take a photo of my ID, and I do understand that they have a backlog.  I'm just anxious to get started.

Once I'm verified and work my way through the cryptocoin landscape I'll be inclined to buy and hold.  Just like another person mentioned, I do want the experience of buying other coin and speculating.
I'm eager to get started since I've always been interested in bitcoin, but only recently have I decided to pull the trigger (getting much closer to 30 than 18).
