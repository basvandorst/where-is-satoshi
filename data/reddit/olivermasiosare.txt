I am very interested in Russian and middle Eastern culture.
I would love to exchange a few words with you and coordinate some efforts. To spread bitcoin and cryptocurrencies adoption. I won't correct your mistakes, rather I hope we can immitate each other.

im a bitcoin junkie need my dose thanks for your generosity
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:42:36
its relevant because highlights the unsustainability of the current market hype. bitcoin is 5 billion in market cap and works efficiently, the international markets need to be fed 200 billions every 3 months to stay alive. that's why its relevant to bitcoin.

I will say that if you see problems with mining centralization should look at alternatives, proof of stake is a possible solution. Making mining available to anyone. Proof of stake has however some problems, there are people working in int.... See rat 4

@_date: 2014-02-21 21:07:18
yes, but they lack this huge audience, besides there are a lot of spanish speakers who want to spread the holy word of bitcoin =), and actually i am doing just that in the r/ mexico
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:53:52
You should try r/dogecoin
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:04:06

@_date: 2015-05-03 10:30:09

@_date: 2015-01-28 09:34:11

Giving tips to apple users is frankly stupid. There are some poor but techonogically open guys using android.

@_date: 2015-01-28 08:48:49
i difined it already as a centrally planned economy 
@_date: 2015-01-28 08:41:22
cheese on crackers rot. one bitcoin is forever XD or until you see a profi..... if any
@_date: 2015-01-28 08:45:52
its true you wont convince someone, the purpose is to inform. and to try to bring arguments you dont hear often. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:00:50
true, i will emphasize that the government decides what to produce, how much and who gets what .
 
and in contrast a decentralized currency will allow everybody to produce  and trade their assets creating a better distribution (assuming none tempers with the market which is the whole idea behind cryptocurrency) 
i am sure this statement have flaws i am open to a discussion.
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:48:46
I am not a charity, but I am making a bitcoin/  blackcoin video to spanish speaking people.... I will be doing a giveaway too so Any bit counts 
Here is my trello submission.
Thanks for the tip
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:37:27
true, which is why we are waiting for the new bitcoin aplications of which we already have decentralized smart contracts (check bithalo/blackhalo) they need volume they exists. these apps eliminate the temptation of corruption or at least diminish it 
@_date: 2015-01-28 08:15:35
true, i should change the idea to cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2015-01-28 08:19:21
you unmasked my true identity a nazi trapped in the body of a brown mexican. i hate you Mengele!!!!
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:28:23
hello its an amazing work what you are doing here.
the past giveaway you did i mentioned my work in spanish ... i finished. thanks for your tips i know first hand how time consuming it is now
@_date: 2015-01-28 07:50:52

@_date: 2015-01-28 09:38:41
synthesis yeah... its interesting at least a good mental exercise .
@_date: 2016-01-07 08:29:24
Sorry for your loss man, i get youI,  lost my wallet last week, 80 bucks (or .17btc) , I know its my fault but family saying be careful with your things and similar obvious crap is just vexing. 
Which coins were you trading?.
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:15:16
it feels that way, you seem to be a bad trader like me. my strategy is to trade altcoins i find valuable that way if i they devalue i buy more.... eventually rise. if i sold and keep apreciating i wait for them to fall. it requires real nerves not to sell low or buy high XD.
good altcoins: dash, Blackcoin. peercoin litecoin(but boring) and doge. 
what are your altcoins?
@_date: 2015-05-21 03:48:47
i would not be impressed if he joins ripple
@_date: 2017-01-18 08:46:45
so much for Bitcoin Jesus.
@_date: 2015-07-24 02:57:04
thanks man, i dont know russian, but i certainly am interested in spreading the word, i too made some translations to spanish of andreass antonopolous, it was a real pain to synch the audio and the subtitles and i was veery slow but a lot of people found it useful which to me is all that matters
if you are looking for  videos to translate here are my two cents
quick explanation video

@_date: 2015-10-05 21:59:58
This is really something..... Although famsa is a lower bracket predatory business for the average "Juan" its exposing bitcoin to the kind of people who really need to know what is bitcoin, I'm talking about people who make 5-15 dlls a day.
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:07:33
wiser words have never been uttered before
@_date: 2015-10-11 22:36:29

1 its not Spanish, its Portuguese man. He is explaining what is bitcoin, you know same old internet money, satoshi etct.
@_date: 2015-03-09 01:35:32
i am not not advertising toilet paper, Rap News is an amazing witty show that is in need of support, they tell important information relevant to human rights, transparency and other important issues.
if that kind of phrasing makes you sick you have bigger problems than this post.
