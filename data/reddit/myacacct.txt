Institutions getting their position so they can "predict". Once it goes up say 10 percent they will dump, and it will crash hard.

No, if anything, that would be Iota, and it's so weird, there is literally no reason for a coin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:42:20
This is literally what a free market looks like guys, come on.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:43:06

Okay, but say it stays at 200 forever, all the people who bought &gt;200 are just fucked? Like great HODL. I understand the technology and theory behind bitcoin, but come on.
