I wouldn't spend everything at once, but jump in and stick it in a paper wallet.  Maybe $5k now, and then average in with the rest over the next month.  Watch charts and try to catch it when it's cheaper.  Make a deal with yourself that you won't sell for at least X months and stick to it, the paper wallet helps with this.  Good luck!

Separating a mineable currency from a blockchain removes any incentive to use a blockchain at all.  The mining incentive is what keeps it decentralized and incredibly difficult to manipulate.  
A blockchain without (public) mining would have to be controlled by private entities to prevent everybody from manipulating it and now you're back to the old banking model.  Might as well save the trouble and skip the blockchain as it really provides nothing of value at this point, just extra complication.
If you just want secure transactions then public/private key encryption is easily accomplished without a blockchain.
Edit: see Ripple for an example of what this looks like: 
"Instead of trusting random validators, we choose specific validators who we 'trust to not collude to defraud us'."
Don't overlook this important feature:

Thank you.
I agree with the bitcoin devs, this doesn't belong in the protocol.

You can interact with the bitcoin network through a variety of languages.  I would personally choose BitcoinJS as a core and node.js as a server-side technology to build a new bitcoin application.  Javascript is the language of web browsers and can be used to build mobile applications as well (see Titanium).

It's a fixed number to avoid manipulation.  Adaptive systems can seem simple on their face but have unconsidered implications.  Simpler is generally better.
Another thing to consider is the cost or value of transmitting a bitcoin transaction as a resource itself.  This should be easily predictable, much like the mining rewards.

I understand where you're coming from, it's hard to see why everyone isn't using it.  I think back to when Mosaic and then the first version of Netscape came out.  It was amazing and so easy to use compared to gopher and lynx, I couldn't understand why everyone didn't use it either.
But to be fair there wasn't a lot of content out there yet.  It was neat technology, and we understood it was going to change things, but it took time for people to adopt it.  You couldn't even buy things on the early internet, imagine that! Nobody believed it would ever be a threat to things like newspapers, much less the music, television and movie industries.  We could imagine that world but it wasn't there yet.  It's here now, and we still use browsers that are very similar and even share ancestry with the first browsers, we still use the HTTP protocol and the SMTP protocol, etc., so it's not much different today than it was back then.
I believe bitcoin adoption should be similar, and that's what we're seeing.  Slow but exponential growth.  Be happy you're in during the early days.  Look around at all of the growth and investment in the space.  It's coming.  Maybe not as fast as you'd like, but it is coming.

Against the current implementation? Global transaction limit of 7 per second for starters.  Obviously the interfaces are lacking and security is a big issue.  I believe difficulty retargeting should happen more frequently, although this hasn't been an issue yet, as hash rate hasn't really fallen.  Once it does confirmations will slow down.  All of these things are flawed but all addressable within the Bitcoin codebase itself.
Edit: clarification, I'm referring to security issues on sites such as exchanges, so this wouldn't be something you fix in the Bitcoin codebase itself.

The bitcoin blockchain is the most secure blockchain, surely the author is referring to it, but there are many examples of alternative blockchains.  Namecoin is one of the more interesting examples in my opinion.  However, the point the author of the tweet is making is that you can't separate the incentive from the technology.

@_date: 2014-10-14 23:40:24
A blockchain without incentives simply doesn't work.  The blockchain exists to provide open trustless access secured by mining.  People won't mine without an incentive.  If you want neither open nor trustless access then you simply don't need a blockchain, it offers you absolutely nothing over existing systems.
You simply cannot divorce the two concepts and be left with anything remotely useful or secure.
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:14:48
Businesses should pass savings from using Bitcoin to consumers, and consumers that have trust in a business don't need to pay extra for consumer protection on that transaction.
For example, a World of Warcraft player might save $1 off his monthly subscription and wouldn't miss the consumer protection offered by a credit card because he trusts Blizzard to provide him with a month of product.  He doesn't need that consumer protection insurance policy.
Businesses in the 'high risk' category, generally ones that sell virtual goods (or dating/adult/etc), pay a minimum of 10% per transaction.  Minimum.  This doesn't include chargebacks.  10% savings for using bitcoin is fairly significant!

I think you have absolutely fair points, and I'm not arguing that everything about Bitcoin is perfect, but what is really? You could make the same argument about the Internet in general, how much energy is wasted watching Youtube videos or browsing reddit? You need to cut down trees to print books.  All of these things require an energy trade-off, and I tend to believe there are bigger environmental issues in the world right now than Bitcoin.

At this point in time, bitcoin is an inflationary currency, but it has nothing to do with the decimal place.  25 new bitcoins are created every 10 minutes.
Increasing the digits after the decimal place is simply dividing the same amount of bitcoin into smaller pieces.  It is neither inflationary nor deflationary.
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:09:07
Bitcoin and blockchain technologies are incompatible with the concepts of central banks and fiat currency.  Let me count the ways:
* There would be no public mining on BankCoin.
* As a result, banks would be solely responsible for maintaining hashrate.  No incentive to contribute.
* Now you've got an easily attackable coin, so nodes can't be public, there must be a gatekeeper / payment processor in front.
* There are big problems with banking and shared public ledgers.  Not going to happen.  And why should it? The nodes can't be public, see points above.
* Now you have to get all the banks to agree on the system/protocol and how it works.  Who has control to distribute funds? Who holds the premined coins? Etc.
* As a consumer making international transactions, you're still trading fiat for fiat at the end of the day and taking the conversion hit.
* All transactions must be cleared by the bank for regulation / FinCEN purposes or the bank could be liable.  KYC and all that.  Not all transactions will be instant by necessity.  Accounts will be frozen.  Funds will be seized.
So what's left? Something that looks an awful lot like the current situation.  I don't see how a blockchain solves anything for banks.
The only thing that might make sense is some sort of private/public key scenario with credit cards, where you have to sign every transaction instead of sending plaintext credit card credentials.  Some consumers may appreciate this but I have a feeling most will see it as an inconvenience, and really the concept itself has nothing to do with blockchains (and is nothing new).

@_date: 2014-03-12 18:23:00
You really think they'd try to start a coin? I'm trying to figure out why that even makes sense.  Fixed value isn't going to attract miners, will they mine it internally? Will the outside world even have access to the network? How could it when there's not enough miners to secure it?
So assuming they use Bitcoin technology for internal transactions between companies or banks or something.. how is that any different from what's done today?
I just don't see how this technology can be used effectively without the incentive based mining network, which can only exist with a floating exchange rate on bitcoin, or else once you hit parity there's no incentive to mine.  So you've got your weak network out there in the public getting forked by multipools or people with lots of hashing power just for fun? Doesn't seem like a winning strategy.
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:32:55
Really wouldn't recommend this, the profit margins are *tight* when they exist, which is usually never.  It's all based on buying cheap enough time to barely offset the cost at the time of mining.  You might as well just buy the coin directly if you're going that route.
Much better to experiment with an existing computer's GPU, get a handle on mining, and decide if you want to invest in your own hardware.  Rent-a-hash and Amazon mining are both terrible ideas in my opinion.

I replied to a couple of them saying 'be nice' or something to that effect, but jeez, I don't know who has the time for it but some dude decided it was his life mission to say something nasty to every new poster.
I guess what I'm saying is sometimes the vocal insane minority makes it look like we're all a bunch of jerks, but really it's just a few people.

* Forward port 8333 from your router to the computer
* Edit the configuration and increase maxconnections, I'm running 20.
Note: this is under Linux, and you can certainly use the Windows Bitcoin-QT client instead of compiling it yourself.  The same port forwarding and maxconnections information applies.  You can find more detailed information with a few quick searches, but this is the basic procedure.

There is a certain wonder I feel towards cryptocurrency, like there's still so much to discover about it.  Same feeling I've had about the Internet and BBSes before that (and computers in general really).

Consider it only takes one new client as a result of accepting bitcoin to ROI on that $400 investment--a client that would've otherwise found a lawyer that did accept bitcoin.

Convert bitcoin sales to cash immediately, don't hold bitcoin, don't refund bitcoin.  I know, "well if Bitcoin is a currency...", it's too volatile right now for major retailers to hold it and try to use it like a currency.  If it ever achieves stability, that might be able to happen, but it's still beneficial to bitcoin to just accept it as a form of payment.  Start there and then the company is well positioned in Bitcoin if it continues to grow, and can adjust their strategy as things change.
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:14:08
Indeed, the Internet has evolved a lot.  It's still mostly the same at its core (TCP/IP), but on its face, the Internet of the 90s looks nothing like today's Internet.  My parents couldn't possibly use the Internet of the 90s, but they use it today with hardly a thought.

I think it's an implied step between it being a threat and it failing, namely that it will be fought.  I just don't think anything can fight bitcoin and win.

Indeed, this is not your fault, I've been on the other side of these integrations, without going into too much detail I'm guessing TigerDirect keeps the order information in their cache for 15 minutes, assuming this is enough time to receive the callback from BitPay that you paid.  This is an arbitrary value and should be raised.  Blocks don't confirm on the dot every 10 minutes, it varies, and I haven't looked it up but I'd imagine 15 minutes between blocks is not unheard of.  I've integrated with Coinbase and have seen delays of up to 15-20 minutes between sending Bitcoin via an external wallet and Coinbase considering it confirmed / sending the callback to the site.

A fully distributed ledger has to be secure by more than just encryption, you need incentive for people to provide the work to secure the ledger, aka "mining", or it will be open to all kinds of attacks.  If you remove the mining then you're describing a web of trust model which is exactly how banks operate today, where trusted gateways validate transactions, not the proof of work system of a blockchain.  In a web of trust security model the concept of a blockchain really has no place and makes no sense.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:18:37
The want to coopt it but they don't get it.  You don't just coopt the technology and expect to have something of value.  Bitcoin is valuable because there's fucking petahashes of mining occurring on its network.  You don't just start a new coin and automatically get the security of petahashes of mining power, and the technology isn't all that useful without enough miners to secure it.
Fixed price exchange rate, LOL! Same reason as above.  You don't just stand up your own distributed ledger.  You could, but again, without miners you're susceptible to major problems.

I'm not really interested in blame, but what is strikingly apparent is there should be a de-facto "industrial strength" client designed for running an exchange or other high traffic site.

Well, I certainly don't have the answers, but off the top of my head there may be potential in Proof-of-Stake algorithms (but I'm not betting on it, literally, I don't hold any PoS coins).  I think over time we will improve clean energy production to the point where the actual physical environmental impact is minimal, but I don't see actual energy consumption being reduced.  It could plateau at some point when there's "enough" mining power, but it's hard to estimate what "enough" is, and I believe it increases over time.

* Comparing cryptocurrency to precious metals is like comparing the Internet to a telephone.  There's a lot more there than just buying stuff.  Think cryptographically secure escrow, automated contracts, autonomous corporations.  This is programmable money.
* Analogy time - Bitcoin is the Internet of money.  It's new, people don't really know what to make of it, most people think it's a fad, but the ones that truly understand it and can extrapolate its implications on the world realize there's much more here than just another currency.
* I was on the Internet in the 90s, my Gramma wouldn't have the first clue what was even happening if she saw it.  She still doesn't use the Internet by the way.
* Digital security is a relatively new field -- indeed not very many things in the digital world are secure.  The cryptography securing Bitcoin is sound, but users can and will absolutely lose their wallet keys.  The solution is fairly simple however, private insurance of the deposits.  I believe companies are already doing this.  It's not widespread yet, but it's by no means an insurmountable problem.  In the meantime use a paper wallet.
Yes, it's new.  It's difficult to use.  It's easy to lose your bitcoins.  However, all of these things are solvable in a relatively short period of time.  The Internet of the 90s hardly resembles the economic behemoth it is today, but the protocols driving it are essentially the same as they've always been, and I believe Bitcoin's story will be similar.

I think what OP is getting at, and I tend to agree, is that the concept of cryptocurrency is the Internet.  The individual implementations are the companies.  Yes, even Bitcoin itself is nothing but the first implementation.  Bitcoin certainly has a head start and overwhelming network effect, but it is not the Internet.

Being an "IT dude" I had heard of bitcoin very early on.  I never thought it was ponzi or malicious, honestly I just thought it was goofy kids doing goofy Internet things and didn't think much of it.  I remember it was the subject of many of our jokes after a few of us caught wind of it--an article was written or something.  None of us really looked into how it worked, we just assumed it was another 'doomed-to-fail' crazy Internet idea.  To be fair, it was.  I'm still amazed where it is today.
I started to change my mind when I found real utility -- I was having trouble finding pot.  Somehow I stumbled upon Silk Road, and low and behold, they use Bitcoin.  What the hell? This is when I decided to look at how it really works.  At this point I had my 'weekend' or whatever where I absorbed absolutely everything Bitcoin.  This was right when Butterfly Labs announced the ASICs, so must've been the summer of 2012.  I spent about a week or two absorbing everything I could find on bitcointalk, which seemed like the only decent resource at the time.
A week or two later I found another pot hookup and promptly forgot about all this stuff.  It was interesting, sure, but I still didn't see it really going anywhere.  To think of Bitcoin as mainstream in summer of 2012 was pretty ridiculous, and I was having second thoughts on trying to buy illegal drugs over the Internet.  I had mined about 190 Litecoins with a few CPUs in those 2 weeks.
When I really got big into Bitcoin was in April 2013, I heard about Bitcoin's big run and something in the back of my mind said "hey, what about Litecoin?" Sure enough, $4 or $5 each.  I immediately converted all my Litecoin to ~4 Bitcoin which I used to pre-order Avalon chips (bad move!) At the same time I set up a scrypt rig (good move!) and started trying to acquire as much as I can.  This is about the point when I realized this is going to be something big and I put a good chunk of money on the line in addition to the hardware purchases.
In all of it, my only regret is not going in bigger sooner.

I would hope more computer science students at the end of their undergraduate program would:
A) Already be somewhat aware of bitcoin or have at some point looked up how it works.
B) Be able to offer at least some insight or proof of internalization of the ideas, not badly regurgitate the information.
C) Present their reactions from the standpoint of computer science implications.
D) Write better (maybe it was a quick type-up of handwritten notes, I would forgive it if that were the case, but if these are copy/pasted...)
Maybe I'm being too rough on them though.  I am happy to see this nonetheless.

It feels like the tactic on bitcoin is to shift focus from the technology itself to the people that use it, as if that somehow invalidates the technology itself.

Really good counterpoint.  I agree with the basic premise, and we're seeing that unfold right now probably, but I have to believe there is a point of saturation.  I'm incredibly tired of following new altcoins, and I believe in altcoins.  There's only so many my brain is going to deal with before it no longer gives a crap.  I don't think it goes to infinite altcoin inflation / $0 market cap for every coin, or $50 as he says.  Nobody wants this, I believe there's a point where even the biggest altcoin supporters will say "enough" and be satisfied with the coins they hold/support already.  This seems like the inverse of the argument that everyone will gravitate to one currency--such absolutes are rarely how things behave in reality.

If it starts to become a problem implement a simple block size increase based on something like Moore's Law or Kryder's Law, much like the reward halvening, but increasing exponentially.

I was there in the 90s using gopher and telnet and lynx.  I don't think it was that people didn't get it or couldn't get it, they just didn't see the point.  It took a lot of imagination to get to today's Internet.  Some people had the vision, and I'm still amazed at how far things have come in such a short time -- my first connection to anything was a 2400 baud modem.  To think we have the equivalent of "T1" lines directly to our house as a standard service in just a few short years still blows me away.  Now I'm just rambling...

I find it generally dangerous and wrong to think in absolutes.  To say all altcoins will crash and burn in a wave of broken dreams is probably about as accurate as saying all altcoins will blossom and grow forever.

It's not bad, I think it's inevitable.  The question comes down to priority.  I think every reasonable person on either side can agree that the block size needs to be raised at some point in the future *and* that we need layer 2 solutions.  I don't believe the rift is over the question of if, but rather when.
The way I see it, the reasonable larger block perspective is that blocks are full now and it's causing problems for individuals and businesses trying to use it today.  Since raising the block size is an inevitability, and we're having problems right now, why not prioritize raising the block size to something workable, say 2MB-4MB, and reduce some of the pressure.  I don't think any reasonable larger block supporter thinks layer 2 solutions are inherently bad, or that we need 8GB blocks tomorrow, or that every transaction must be on the blockchain.
From the small block perspective you want to encourage research and development of layer 2 solutions.  If the block size is raised to reduce pressure it takes pressure off finding these solutions.  This creates a situation where layer 2 solutions aren't needed and maybe aren't prioritized, and they're absolutely correct in thinking you can't solve the scaling problem long term simply by raising the block size.
A more subtle point is the exponential nature of block verification and opening DoS attack vectors by raising the block size to the point where it takes 20 minutes to verify a malicious block.  This is not an issue to take lightly, but I think reasonable short term solutions exist.  I think an upper limit on the number of sigops allowed per block is perfectly reasonable and can be considered as a consensus-level DoS rule much like the block size limit itself.  I don't see any reasonable activity being hindered by such a limit, it'll simply prevent the possibility of these types of attacks and allow the block size to be safely raised to a reasonable level in the interim between everything happening on-chain and ubiquitous layer 2 solutions.
Personally I think a modest block size increase paired with a focus towards developing and deploying layer 2 solutions is the only reasonable way forward.  I think the majority can agree with this but unfortunately a large rift has been created and people have taken almost ideological sides.  This is resulting in a stalemate where nothing can move forward and it's very disheartening.  The mischaracterizations of the arguments on each side coupled with the demonization of well meaning people in both camps have created a nasty untenable situation where nobody's willing to budge an inch and thus we have two subreddits of what appear to be people in opposite camps when in reality we probably have a supermajority that would be willing to find a middle ground.

The gist is this:
1) Install/compile bitcoind.  Run it and configure it so rpc listen is only on 127.0.0.1 (or appropriate LAN range).
2) Write your code, use an appropriate bitcoind RPC wrapper for the language you're using.
lifeboatz makes a good point, you should be very mindful of where private keys are stored.  Probably not a good idea to store them in your bitcoind instance wallet -- it's not necessary.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:23:41
I advise you to take every security precaution you reasonably can.
However, the easiest/most secure way to store your bitcoins is to go to  and generate a normal address.  Load the website and go offline if you're feeling extra paranoid--it generates addresses within your browser, not through a server, so the private key is never transmitted or known by any other computer.
Don't save the file to your hard drive or any device, print the page on a printer that you're sure doesn't store copies of what is printed on it and close the browser.  If you absolutely can't print the page then you can probably write down the private key, just be very, very, very careful that you write it down correctly.
Avoid any urge to save the private key to any hard drive or thumb drive in any form and you should be fine long term.  Make sure you understand how paper wallets work if you decide to spend some, especially issues with receiving change.
Practice a few times creating wallets on  and importing into blockchain.info until you're comfortable with the process.

If you're in the US, the easiest way is coinbase.  I've used them for a few months with no issues.  They can ACH transfer to/from your bank account.  You will have to jump through some hoops and wait a few days for the bitcoin to fund to your coinbase account, but I believe you can make the purchase as soon as your bank account is verified and 'lock in' your price.
Make sure you enable 2-factor authentication! I use Authy on my cellphone, it works well.
Even though I trust coinbase, I don't keep much bitcoin in coinbase itself, just in case.  I would recommend transferring to a paper wallet for long term storage/investment.

I don't want to get you too excited, but if you actually bought between the timeframe of April 2010 and June 2010 then you may have paid as little as $0.008/coin or less, according to this page:

You might end up with &gt;$308 worth of bitcoin in a year or two, but it will be a very small amount of bitcoin unfortunately.
I have 20 GH/s running right now.  It makes about 0.02 BTC per day, so you can expect about 0.005.  This is at the current difficulty--expect that amount to halve about every month.  You should study these sites:
So it may pay for itself in time vs. its cost in dollars, but consider bitcoin was around $100 each in July, $300 worth of July bitcoin would be 3 entire bitcoin, or about $2100 right now.
I'm really not trying to be a jerk here, I bought miners too, but I'm hoping to help illustrate these ideas for others who might be considering getting into mining--learn from our mistakes, just buy the bitcoins instead.

Regardless of your opinion on the value of altcoins, they are not Bitcoin.  I can create an altcoin right now, but I can't use that coin via BitPay or Coinbase.
On the other hand, you have Dogecoin, and everyone sees how popular it is and thinks of all the value leaving Bitcoin and going to Dogecoin.  Here's the problem with that thinking: Dogecoin fans wouldn't buy Bitcoin anyway.  We didn't *lose* anything.  It's like the RIAA calling music downloads "lost sales".  It's not exactly that simple.
But what we do have are a lot of new people using Bitcoin software with a Doge logo slapped on it.  They're being trained to use Bitcoin and becoming accepting of the *technology*, who gives a crap what meme or image or name you slap on it.  It's a net gain for Bitcoin.

I think it's incredibly unlikely that any alt coin will become more valuable than BTC in the short to mid term.  I also think LTC has the potential to become much more valuable than it is right now.  
LTC has good fundamentals in my opinion: solid development team, traded on quite a few exchanges, strong mining network, enough differentiation to make it relevant, you can actually buy things with it.  It's potentially higher-reward at this point, but also much riskier.

It seems the hard part is done, in that bitcoin exists and is recognized as having value.  There really just needs to be reputable money changers at either end to complete the transaction.  I'm quite sure this network is already growing in pockets around the world.
In a way, simply having exchanges in either country is enough.  An individual's remittance to China seems relatively easy to accomplish right now with nothing more than the exchanges.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:37:47
It's a pretty simplified way at looking at things, but in a way, yes, assuming everyone acted rationally (ie. turned off their miners when no longer profitable).
I have a litecoin miner that's been running for months through the price slump, mining has been great even if the value of the stash hasn't been so hot.  That's been changing the past week or so though.  I kind of hope the price falls back down for awhile so I can get a few more coins before it's time to shut it down.
The problem with this logic is if the coins are cheap, just buy the coins and save yourself the trouble, and miners are kind of a pain to keep running (not to mention the heat/noise).  I definitely don't recommend anyone start mining at this point.

Thanks for sharing your story and I'm sorry to hear about your losses.  This is a fantastic lesson for any would-be day traders.  If you aren't a shark and you aren't a whale, you're a fish, and when fish play with sharks and whales they (eventually) get eaten.
A few points to consider about these alt coins:
* The coins, in many cases, are literal copy/paste jobs using a tutorial you can google for.  These coins are not maintained by developers.  If there's a bug, it's over.  Updates from whatever code base they originated from are rarely applied.
* For many, the network is literally "secured" by 50-100 GPUs (and I'm being generous here).
* Many are 'pre-mined'.
* Some have extreme block rewards that halve quickly, giving early miners ridiculous amounts of coin while trying not to look like a pre-mine scam.
* Many of these coins were never created to achieve anything more than short term profits for the "creator" (I use that term loosely).
Obviously I'm generalizing here, Litecoin seems solid and I believe in it long term, NameCoin and decentralized DNS is a fantastic concept, Quark is crazy, some of these coins offer legitimately interesting ideas and some have legitimately good developers behind them.  But if you don't know what you're dealing with then it's really best to either stay away or at the very least educate yourself first.

I understand being excited about new systems of credit, at the same time I don't see how it's having any real impact.  You say it's older than bitcoin, and it still hasn't caught on?
"Isn't it the same for bitcoin?"
Actually, no, that's kind of the point of bitcoin.  It's a trust-less system.
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:42:39
Bitcoins are transferred and accounted for using a system of inputs and outputs.  The only time a bitcoin transaction can have no inputs is when it's mined, and in that case it's awarded to the solver of the block.  This is the only way bitcoin can be created.
When you have bitcoin in your wallet, you have it because somewhere along the lifetime of those coins they were transferred to you and have yet to be transferred elsewhere.  In other words, somebody with the private key for an address that was sent coins used that private key to set new outputs on those coins -- namely your wallet address -- and submitted it as a transaction.  The network picked up that transaction, included it in the block chain, and now you have a positive balance.
Bitcoin balances are calculated by following the chain of transactions from a coin's inception (when it was mined) to the present, or the current end of the block chain.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:35:06
If this is a paper wallet then you should import it into blockchain.info or some other wallet software.  This will handle the change issue, but be aware that the change will be in a new address that your wallet software controls.

I won't answer your question with a riddle, I'll simply say in my opinion Yes, Buy The Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:03:32
You may have to break it into little tiny chunks.  The size is related more to how many incoming transactions make up your balance (ie. actual size in bytes of your transaction) than the number of bitcoins you're moving.  Once you've moved them it will sort of 'collate' them down to a smaller set of transactions though.

That sounds like a fantastic use of $10K.
I will say that $700-800 bitcoin seems expensive, but so did $160 when I finally broke down and just bought some.  I still find it hard to pull the trigger at $700-800 myself though and haven't bought over about $180.  I think I need to get over that myself as it seems like those days are long gone.

Fair enough, I did some quick reading, as a decentralized open-source currency exchange implementation I see potential value, but I don't see how you monetize it? Or how I, as an average person, in any way benefit?
Let's see, step by step guide...
"NOTE: Ripple is in Beta and the currency exchange is only available to users with active accounts and XRP reserves."
I understand beta testing with funny money but they're actually proposing it as a real currency.
"Ripple Labs will hold half of all the XRP in existence, in the hope that they will gain value."
The whole XRP concept just reeks to me and otherwise I don't see how this can possibly benefit me right now as an individual? Please enlighten me if I'm somehow missing something.

The Miner's Fallacy.  If you spend that $274 today on Bitcoins and the price goes up, you'll have more bitcoins, hence more money.

You should be fine.  It says it'll confirm in about 2 minutes, so keep checking.  I moved approximately this amount to a paper wallet last night, and it was very nerve wracking, but it eventually made it.
One interesting thing to note about the 'size' of transactions.  This isn't related to how much bitcoin you're sending as much as it's related to how many incoming transactions you've received.  So if you received your coins in chunks of 0.05, and you're sending 25, that's a whole lot of information to broadcast to the network.  If you simply received 25 bitcoin in a single transaction and sent it, you probably wouldn't have to pay a transaction fee.
Moral of the story is you can move large amounts like this in small chunks and generally avoid transaction fees.  I probably shouldn't encourage this though as miners could use all the help they can get! :)
Edit: OK, it is a little strange that it's been sitting for so long, and the time estimate on blockchain.info keeps moving around.. I'm curious as well, pretty sure it'll all be fine but I'll be keeping an eye on this.  My guess is transactions with higher fees relative to the size are jumping ahead of you in line.  At some point you should hit a lull and get your transaction confirmed in a block.

What does "believing in the value of Bitcoin" accomplish ultimately? On the other hand, accepting Bitcoin on a large online retailer, even if converted directly to fiat, greatly improves the utility and thus value of Bitcoin.

While I'm not a fan or in any way advocating for it, if indeed the company is not legally required, I think they may be trying to future-proof the design for anticipated regulations.  It still doesn't explain why they wouldn't just disable it for now.  Maybe they will if there's enough backlash?

I work for a fairly large company that is in the process of releasing bitcoin payments currently.  Here's our thought process:
Adding bitcoin to an existing array of payment options is easy and low risk.  It's not overtaking traditional payment methods anytime soon, so the vast, vast majority of revenue is still flowing in from normal avenues.
This is an easy way for a company to invest in bitcoin.  Just hold it for a year, why convert it to dollars immediately if you don't need the cash?
If bitcoin continues to take off we are well positioned for that influx of business--we're already well acquainted with the nuances of the system.  If bitcoin fails, so what? Move on to the next thing.
Some of our customers also appreciate the degree of anonymity that bitcoin can offer (similar to pre-paid debit).  We know it's not 100% anonymous but it's a far cry from line items on your credit card / bank statement.
tl;dr low risk to adopt, big potential upside

We can build our own network, just like we built our own currency.  Check out Project Meshnet, the bitcoin of centralized ISP control.

This calculator lets you run scenarios of various difficulty increases to see how much your miner is making at points in time in the future.

Use the 'Custom Send' feature of blockchain.info to send from a private key typed in.  You can also import the wallet using the QR code, by far the easiest way.  Many bitcoin clients will also import paper wallets in various ways.  After you import a paper wallet, you should move your remaining balance to a new paper wallet that has never been imported.

Simply put, it's hard/impossible to get USD out of Gox right now, and it's been this way for awhile.  The 10% difference is the Gox risk calculated in.

I can sympathize, I have also had a transaction cancelled due to being high risk, and this was after a few successful transactions (I did have 2 pending transactions at the time one was cancelled, this could be what triggered it).
Luckily I was still able to get in fairly cheap and am fully verified now and have had no problems since.  I've purchased bitcoin instantly a few times now with no trouble.
I still recommend Coinbase to new users because there's just no better alternative in the US.  I just also recommend that if they're thinking about buying bitcoins, they should start the Coinbase process now and not when they decide to buy (they still haven't done it--they'll see).

Calm down, friend.  Being a jerk isn't going to help bitcoin adoption.

Nice! I wouldn't even try to high-brow it, something like:
"I got into bitcoin a few years ago myself.  At one point I had over 5000 bitcoins.  Unfortunately I made some bad investments with them--especially that ounce of medical-grade hydro on Silk Road.  Turns out that wasn't a good trade.  It was a FUN trade..."
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:05:08
I think if you want to quantify the intrinsic value of a cryptocurrency, a good short-term measure is the hashing power of the network.  It's a measure of the security of the value stored in that network, much like gold is secure because of its scarcity and the security of that scarcity.
You can easily fork the bitcoin software and make "bitcoin 2.0" (or litecoin, etc.) but you don't have any value unless you have miners, and you don't have any miners unless you have value--it's really a catch-22 that I believe will keep bitcoin in the lead for a very long time, if not indefinitely.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:49:38
My aha moment was when my weed connections ran dry and I heard about this Silk Road thing.
Never actually bought any weed on Silk Road but instead got big into Bitcoin (and Litecoin, the only thing I could mine at the time with my CPUs, this was 2012).  Mined 190 Litecoins, forgot about it (got another weed connection).
Come April 2013 bubble and I find my LTC worth a decent chunk of money.  Re-invested in ASIC hardware, a GPU miner for litecoin, and eventually just bought a bunch of bitcoin as well.  No longer planning on buying weed with them though (I have a medical card now so that's been solved).  Would love to see the dispensaries start accepting Bitcoin though.. would make a lot of sense for them.

Actually, it does have monetary value, about $5.40 each at the time of this writing.

Yes, the actual address generation is javascript that runs in your browser.  Keys are never transferred.  You can go offline and the page will continue to generate addresses.  You can file -&gt; save as the web page code itself and load it on an offline computer for more security.
The only potential question is 'just how random are those keys'.  I haven't seen a very good analysis of this unfortunately.

Depends on how far said government would be willing to go.  I don't think it's likely, but let's assume a government wants to stamp out cryptocurrencies in their country, some sort of "war on crypto".  It wouldn't be difficult to sniff all Internet traffic, something we're all aware is already happening, and identify/arrest people participating in the networks.  It's really as simple as that.
People will eventually find ways around the snooping.  Mesh nets and Hyperboria are already under development.  Consumer-grade electronics can be converted into personal networks and encrypted tunnels on the real Internet can connect these personal networks securely, as happens today with Tor and similar technologies.

"Bitcoin will never be a mature store of value because it's not a mature store of value right now."
Volatility is decreasing as the currency matures.  You can't have it all day one.  Even gold has volatility, and thousands of years of history backs up gold as a store of value, *despite* the fact that you can't really do anything useful with gold except make jewelry.  It's scarce and people like it, so that seems to be enough.

Really a great idea with a good plan of execution.  My only advice is to look into coin security.  I'm a professional software developer, 10+ years with a Bachelors' in Computer Science, and I'm still paranoid about my coins.  I can't stress it enough, for long term storage find the most secure solution that works for you.
I personally have 99% of my coin in a paper wallet (just a regular one, no brain wallet or nonsense like that) and a small amount on Coinbase for spending.  Coinbase itself may be a very good choice too, it sounds like they have strong security measures, but I still have trouble trusting 3rd parties to hold my coin at this point in the game.
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:37:15
Haha! It could even be more than 1850, it could be 4000! Either way you did well.  Whatever you don't cash out I would store in a paper wallet, it's about the easiest/most secure way to store coins long term.  Oh, and congratulations!!

Buying is a bet on bitcoin's price rising.  Mining is a bet on bitcoin's price falling.  
If the price goes up, more miners go online, difficulty goes up, and you mine less coins.  If the prices goes down, miners get discouraged and turn off their rigs, the difficulty goes down, and you mine more coins.
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:45:35
I really don't understand the specifics, but I do understand that it's 100% pre-mined and controlled by central parties.  This makes it completely worthless in my mind and I haven't bothered to read any further.

If you were in the process of downloading the blockchain and had this other wallet imported, you might see transactions made on the imported wallet go by in 'fast forward' as the blockchain is downloaded.

Godspeed, Ripple.
Trust in the network and source code, not trust in individual people.  If the bitcoin developers go rogue and push nefarious code, the community will quickly fire them and fork their own clean version.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:31:13
Bitcoin does have a mechanism to combat this, if users decide to use it: transaction fees.  This could incentivize ex-miners to turn their machines back on.  It's still a bad situation.
I think quicker difficulty readjustment is a good idea.  If you've spent any time in the alt-coin world you've seen miners ride the 'difficulty waves' -- jumping from coin to coin as difficulties adjust down.  The coins that readjust faster seem to be immune to this.  Is there a good reason for the current readjustment rate?
