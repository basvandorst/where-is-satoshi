I can relate to this. Going to bed now and looking forward to the candles on my screen in the morning

you should atleast try btc-e as someone mentioned. and someone also mentioned Localbitcoins which has escrow features
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:37:28
your wallet software should keep you synced when it is running. i'm not sure i understand what you mean by "find" your bitcoins

That was the deal in Germany recently, but it depends on which country it is. In Norway i'll have to pay 28% in capital gains no matter what

thanks for this, but any tl;dr?

It depends on what exchange you're using. Bitcoin is either mined or bought from someone at an exchange. There's not *one* market value

i agree, Kraken looks super nice and has a very clean feel to it. just wish it had more volume :/
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:34:56
but has gone through a couple of reboots and iterations :)

i have to echo this. implementation on the exchange i don't think is too hard, but the security is way scary

It's not free. It was made so EU transfers would be quicker and cheaper, but not free

But then he *should* leave them because it's not right that they can discriminate against things they don't *like*. I have money in a bank to keep it safe and be able to transfer it
