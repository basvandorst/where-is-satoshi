how does it matter what the transactions were for?  bitcoin transactions are a transfer of value, regardless of the purpose or intent.
it's wonderful that this little experiment is able to fight for space on the same chart as an industry giant like paypal, even if paypal transactions represent a more limited scope.
but you're right, it probably is dishonest leave out that bitcoin transactions include someone moving money from one hand to the other
i think journalism today is more about "honest enough," bitcoin or not
@_date: 2014-12-26 14:48:15
scaling is a difficult problem with difficult solutions, but it misses the point
bitcoin already solved the unsolvable part.
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:28:25
because this is one more check box under the tyrannical column, and it's getting pretty crowded in there
what need does this fill?  if people trusted/wanted an entity to perform this task, wouldn't a private company have capitalized on it?  if the government compels me to be a part of this program, i'll want to understand why
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:20:09
i'm not sure about decades
we're "due" for another recession, and they only just ended QE
but anyway, hopefully the innovation surrounding bitcoin allows people to transition off fiat gracefully instead of a painful economic collapse-- sort of like a voucher transition to a new "red dollar" except naturally instead of from desperation

society will mock you as you mock us.  technologies that take over seem obvious in hindsight.  I remember in the 90's as a teenager, being faced with the same critical mindset and fear from my peers and elders as bitcoiners face now--even though it was obvious to me what was happening (despite nothing nearly as useful as google or myspace).  now facebook is for *parents*.
really, do you think we'll be using wads of cash and vulnerable bullshit numbers 10 years from now?  keep in mind that at that point the chips that can fit in a smart watch will be more powerful than current gen video gaming systems and even the youngest baby boomers will be facing retirement

I remember I had a package delivered to my door from USPS before, and I had no idea that they even did that (I thought USPS was mailbox-only).  I asked about it the next time I had to pick up a "sorry we missed you" package from the post office, and I was told "the postal worker only does that if they care about customer service."
Thank you, the one who cared.

@_date: 2014-07-25 12:13:12
uh, he released it on the crypto mailing lists, and even they more or less ignored/laughed at the idea
you talk like cryptography was always a superstar of computer science, but that was so very, very far from the truth until AFTER bitcoin proved itself to work.
if you really believe bitcoin was created with the sinister intentions of one evil genius planning to get mega rich and destroy the world--despite all the evidence that he wanted to provide new level of freedom to humanity-- even that is far less malevolent than controlling the printing press (and destroying the world).
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:44:18
no, the opposite of bitcoin
if anyone ever sees your credit card number--which is displayed on the thing's face and gets punched into every shitty website you visit-- they can access your credit at will.  and there's nothing i can do about it.

Being on AOL, chatting with other kids my age and being on the web all the time was just a given for myself and the rest of us on there.  But according to the adults and peers in my life, the internet was scary and for perverts (which of course, teenagers are ;).

right, alot of us were skeptical at first and asked questions like "is this a scam?" and "how could this possibly work (computer science-wise)?" and were so impressed by the answers we became.. enthusiastic.
(no and the blockchain, btw)

yeah, his explanation can be paraphrased as "it's hard and stuff cause bitcoin"

Household debt is optional?

"As the government draws its income from much of the population, government debt is an indirect debt of the taxpayers."
Please, enlighten me.

A child born in the USA this moment is responsible for paying a share of the $18,141,444,135,563.30 national debt.
Only a system run by sociopaths would condemn a nation of unborn generations to debt slavery.  In order to fund wars they don't ask congress to fight, and jail pot-heads.

How is that number nonsense?  I'm not sure what you're saying here.
I think the current state of nearly everything government related is to do with the national debt and what it represents.  The magic print button has let america focus on throwing money at things with the illusion of infinite resources.  When money is limited, no one wants to be the fool to waste it.

For generations to come.
I'm not enjoying it much at all.  I won't be getting social security--a system I've paid into since I was old enough to work.  Every time I've voted, I've felt used relatively quickly afterwards.  I feel let down by a public education, and the state subsidized education that followed.  I feel violated by flagrant violations of privacy, and I don't much appreciate the bold lies when confronted about it.  I'm sick of seeing innovation stifled by inexcusable government policy.
I cherish what crumbs the free market can sneak through, but I wish the promise of a *better* future would get on with it, already.
