Thanks for posting this.  Even though I should never be tempted to do what you just did, I am tempted ALL THE TIME.  It takes constant reminders for me to HODL.  
I learned a long time ago that if you try to time the market, you'll time yourself right out of your position.
Even though I know this, humans are weak, stupid creatures.  I'm no exception.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:12:12
Right.  No, I wasn't saying it was all bad.  And honestly, it's good to see some guys cashing out a bit.  If I was one of the guys who had 89,000 coins from 2010 I might think it's a good time to start living a bit too

Was just chatting with folks who have relatives in India on how easy/difficult it is to get money from India to the US.
Their opinion was that it was exceedingly inconvenient, at best, and very difficult at worst.
Bitcoin?  Click of a mouse.  Money is moved.
If you don't see the utility in that, I'm not sure you'll ever see any utility in this, regardless of how many examples you're given.
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:57:01
Is there any way for you to set up an account with Coinbase?
Do you have a relative in the US who can help you?
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:28:51
that would suggest either one large or several smaller sell orders at $2,200 or 2,000 GBP.  We're not going any higher until all those sell orders are filled.
that's the thing with bitcoin. That could mean 5,000 coins or 100,000 coins. There's no way to know.  A lot of the guys there at the beginning hold an insane amount of bitcoin.
But the sale is necessary and has to happen.  It will also lead to stability in the future as those coins go from one (or a few) folks with a mountain of coins to many, many people with a more modest pile.

The tulip analogy is apt and instructive.
The reality is that anything is only worth what people think it is worth.
I love guitars. The same guitars that sold for $200 when I was a little kid sell for $30,000 today. Some of that is inflation.  Most of it is just that people perceive that they're more valuable.
Intrinsically, a guitar only has the value of being something a person can play and make music on. But you can do that on a $300 guitar perfectly well.  So, the UTILITARIAN value of a guitar?  Let's call it $300.
Anything above that?  Anything above that is a premium that people place on the item.
Dutch tulip bulbs?  Worth nothing, really.  Intrinsically, they're worth the satisfaction you would get from planting them and then seeing them bloom into something that smells good and is pleasant to look at.  So, maybe not "nothing", but certainly not very much.
Bitcoin?  Has an intrinsic value.  If you had $100 and needed a way to get it across the country to your grandmother because she needed a way to buy medicine?  That would be worth SOME money to you.  How much?  Hard to tell, but it's a small amount.
But what if you had to send remittances home from the US to Mexico? And Western Union is expensive. And Trump now doesn't want to allow remittances, etc.  How much is bitcoin worth to you, now?
It has value.
Beyond that?  It has whatever value people give to it.
No different than any other form of currency, but i's more powerful with intrinsic capability that other currency doesn't have.
A US dollar?  Intrinsically worthless.  It truly has no worth at all.  Just like bitcoin, in a post-apocalyptic world where we have to kill for our meals?  A dollar would be worth nothing.  Gold?  Probably the same.  Go back 3,000 years and try to get something in exchange for a dollar.  Probably worth something as artwork, but that's it.
You'd be better off going back 3,000 years with a disposable lighter.
So, is there a silliness aspect to the idea that bitcoins are actually worth something?  You bet.
But it's the same silliness that lets me take an essentially worthless piece of paper and buy a hamburger with it. 
Money is only worth what people think it is.

FWIW, I think you have at least a 50% shot at being in the black this year.

Okay, you need to have your friend set up a coinbase account.
He can deposit money into the account and then buy bitcoin with it.
Or, since you will be working with your friend, maybe it works this way:
1.  You wire your friend, say, $1,000 for him to put in a bank account.
2.  Your friend sets up the bank account.  Then, sets up a coinbase account.  He links the account.
3.  You can then have your friend use the money in the bank account to make purchases in the coinbase account.
That's how I'd do it.  Of course, you'd need a friend you can trust.
You could also virtually take control of the bank account:  change passwords, etc., so your friend can't access it.
Only downside is that your friend would be subject to US taxes when/if you sell at a gain.  
But that's the general shape of it.  Have a friend set up a US bank account (probably in HIS name, but maybe in both your names if it's allowed?)
Wire transfer money into that account.
Link that account to a coinbase account.  (In fact, if you can access coinbase from India, you can probably set up the coinbase account yourself, unless there's some sort of law against it.)
You could even buy the coinbase bitcoins, then transfer them to India where you sell them at Indian rates.  
Buy at US rates, sell at India rates.
That's what I'd be thinking in your shoes.  
Best of luck.
As for legality, I can't advise you there. There's all sorts of laws regarding movement of money, but I don't think there's much in the way of restrictions on moving money from India to the US.
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:49:13
Okay, I must not have set it up properly, then.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:12:37
Seems to me the price is stabilizing at about $2,200.  
So, the opinion of one idiot on the internet says yeah, we found support.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:11:01
My personal opinion?  You have a better than average chance of doing well, financially, and a nonzero chance of being really, really rich.  Best of luck!!!!
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:23:54
Thanks man!  I wish you continued good fortune!
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:31:37
Was sorta wondering the same thing myself.  If not the week chart, maybe the month chart?  Which, frankly, would be an astounding win for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:24:20
I wish I could help. I use coinbase but only because they were the first safe one I heard about 3 years ago.  I'm sure you can probably find some by googling "Bitcoin exchanges".  Some of them sound better than coinbase
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:38:05
That's a really important question.
To me, with the amount of bitcoin I hold (not much), I think my first point where I'll be tempted to sell is at $20,000.
Until then, I'll probably just ride this thing. And frankly, the next runup we have could hit $20,000.  (This latest blip?  Wasn't even a runup.  2x?  BWAHAHAHAA!  That's not a bitcoin bubble.  A bitcoin bubble is usually something like 10X.)
So, I'll probably sell 1 BTC at $20,000.  At that point, I've recovered absolutely everything I've ever put into alt currencies.  I'm playing entirely with house money.
After that?  I will probably sell 1/3 to 1/2 of the remainder when it hits $40,000.
After that, I hope I can just let it ride.
But right now I can stand pat because even if I sold ALL my alt currency, I could, at most, get like enough money to buy an inexpensive new car.
But when we start talking about six, or maybe 7 figures?  At that point, that's life-altering.  It's foolish not to realize this and take some money off the table.
Bitcoin will ALWAYS have a risk of going to zero.  That's hard to take if you have $30,000 worth of bitcoin.  But it's much harder to take if you have $1,000,000.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:12:54
Yeah, that's the crazy thing.  Seems like the best way to get money out of India is to buy bitcoin with it.  Haha!
Somebody else told me this today, too.  So, yeah, I believe you. It's apparently not that easy to get money out of India.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:41:37
So, was there a lag between you setting it up and it showing up?
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:21:23
Some folks got excited.  Bought some btc.  Caused price to go up.  Other folks got excited.  Piled in. Buyers dried up.  Price is coming down.
I know that sounds like a smartass answer but it is absolutely the whole truth about this.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:10:01
I'm curious about your thesis, here.
What do you think has changed?
(Not being a smartass.  Sincerely interested in your views, here.)
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:06:37
That's all we can do, really.  It's a helpless feeling, but this will give us something to look forward to every time it drops. Haha!
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:37:15
If I had that sort of insight, I'd be too busy with supermodels on my private island to post on reddit.  ;)
My advice is that if you like something that you think will appreciate, get in and forget you have it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:50:05
I'm buying a small amount at each $100 increment it falls.
That way I don't have to lose sleep over one GIGANTIC buy at a specific price.
I think the price will not stabilize for a while.  Might even fall for the next year.  I am implementing regular weekly buys in anticipation of this.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:36:29
Premature to call it, but looking at the charts, this looks an awful lot like where the turnaround happens.
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:41:17
That's actually a fantastic point.
Yep, never thought of it that way, but once bitcoin is mature and we don't see these 10X runups and crashes, it'll actually be a stable currency.  There won't be a need to sell it because it'll already be money.
Thanks for being the mind=blown of the day for me.
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:21:48
Everything you're talking about makes sense.  I can't remember how long it takes for coinbase to set everything up, but that plan is very sound.
and even better:  you can immediately transfer the bitcoin to a wallet in India and sell it on the Indian market for an immediate profit!
Sorry, I don't know how long coinbase takes to verify funds.  But coinbase isn't the only place in the US to get bitcoin, either.  I'm sure their website could tell you.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:37:05
I think what happened is that somebody gave a papa john's gift-card to the person trying to get a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:22:32
Okay, first:
1.  Yes, you are already losing money.  The price of bitcoin and etherium can go both up and down.
2.  Never buy just $20 on coinbase.  Their fees are like $2.99 up to like $200 or something.  So, you paid a really high fee on your purchase.
3.  If you did  this to make money THIS WEEK, this is not a good thing to do.  If you did this because you have a use for bitcoin or etherum (like sending money overseas), you made a good decision.  If you did this because the price may appreciate over time?  Only time will tell, but you'll need to wait months or probably years to really know for sure.
Good luck. Yes, you lost money in the last few minutes. Hang on, you may make money in the next few.
If you like this long-term, consider doing what somebody else suggested and set up regular buys every so often.
NO MATTER WHAT YOU HEAR nobody knows or can know what the price of anything will do in the future.  The best anybody can ever do is guess.
And if you are trying to trade for short term profit, there are richer, smarter guys than you who will essentially cheat and take all your money.
Buy what you can afford.  Hold for a long time. You might be happy in the long run.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:42:50
Exactly. At some point in the future, this will be crystal clear.
Right now, there's no way to know whether this is just the first sell-off or not. Because lots of things on that chart could be the first sell-off.
Previous bubbles hit multiples of like 10x and 20x.  This one never came close to that.
Which tells me that even if it is a bubble, it's likely to have a softer landing.  Who knows. Even if we settle in at 1,800, I'm going to be happy.
And accumulating.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:49:20
Other folks have given pieces of this puzzle, but I'll just try to summarize it, here.
Current miners?  Not likely to become whales.  They have to expend WAYYYYY too much effort to mine even a single bitcoin.  
Literally, if you tried to start mining bitcoins, today?  Chances are you'd pay more for the electricity required than you'd get in bitcoin value in return.
That's why so many miners (like 70%?  I think?) are in china. They get electricity for free because they're near big hydroelectric power plants that sell or give away cheap electricity if you're nearby.
So, the miners aren't the problem.  
The problem, as somebody else pointed out, is that the whales are the folks who were doing this in 2010 and such.  There are people out there with bitcoins in the hundreds of thousands. Probably even millions of bitcoins.
If they decided to dump all those bitcoins on the market? Yes, they could crash it so bad that it essentially renders bitcoin worthless.
Figure the crash of 1929, but instead of markets involving millions of people, we're talking markets being destroyed by 2 or 3 people.  
But ask yourself:  why would they do that?  If a person has a million bitcoins, that person is worth $2 billion dollars.
I can see why they would sell SOME of their bitcoin.  
But I don't see why they'd try to destroy the system. If bitcoin dies, their $2 billion goes away.
The smart play for them, if they wanted to be in regular money and not bitcoin, would be to gradually sell their bitcoin so as NOT to cause a crash.
Which leaves, the question:  are there guys so big that they can cause a crash?  
Yes.  There are. Especially now that you can place limit orders.  They can release blocks of bitcoin to be sold that will cause a panic.  And during that panic, they can then run around and buy up bitcoins for a fraction of their former value.
Bitcoin is FAR more subject to manipulation this way than most things, because most other things have at least some regulation.
Bitcoin doesn't.  Which is why it's important, if you want to make money in this space, for you to ignore short-term fluctuations and hold (HODL) for the long-term.
That's true with even conventional investments like stocks.  But it's even MORE true with bitcoin.
So, yeah, you have to account for the whales, but they don't want to destroy bitcoin. That would be self-destructive.
But they might want to cause a panic now and then to get your bitcoins on the cheap.  Thing is, they can't make you sell.  So, if you don't, you don't become one of their victims.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:10:39
Hahahaha!  Yeah.  Or sell.  Or buy.  There are no wrong answers here.  I'm actually looking to add to my position.
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:51:44
That's what I'm suspecting. That it'll show up, but that they're probably up to their eyeballs just trying to keep up with this current volume.
Thing is, if the price goes up, I'll probably cancel my order.  I only wanted to buy if we were headed for a period of prolonged low and languishing prices.  At $2,300 and higher, buying $150 a week seems pretty pointless.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:03:54
totally agree.  
Somebody with 1,000 bitcoins probably just decided its time to be a cash money millionaire and dumped his coins on the market all at once.  
It's already climbing back.
This tiny dip didn't even really manage to wipe out the gains from THE PAST 24 HOURS for perspective.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:42:07
?  What?  He just transferred Bitcoin To a different wallet.  There's a fee for that?
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:37:09
Anybody who says they know where bitcoin will be a year or two from now is lying or kidding themselves.  Nobody really knows.
I'm in bitcoin because I believe the demand will outstrip the supply.  If that happens, the price will increase.  There is no way to know by how much or when.
Anything beyond that is a guess.  AND on top of that, bitcoin could always go to zero.
Best of luck!
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:44:00
I don't think the HODLers are saying "never sell".  If you got 1,000 bitcoin in 2011 and can now retire, screw it.  Do it. Sell it.  You've reached the point we all want to get to.
The HODLers are trying to talk people into not panic selling.  It's just human nature to want to sell when things look bad.  Unfortunately, that's half of "sell low" and if you bought on the runup, you completed the other part of the formula by "buying high".
In all sorts of markets, not just bitcoin, the only folks who really come out ahead in the long run are folks who buy and hold.
i mean HODL.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:11:26
Yeah, I'm not advocating either for or against. That's a decision each person has to make for him/herself.  Only they will have to live with the consequences and only they will reap the rewards if there are any.  I think that bitcoin will, at some point in the future, be worth six figures per coin.  Or zero.  No telling which one.  I honestly don't know.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:16:15
Coinbase will let me buy and initiate a transfer with my bank.  So, I don't need money sitting in the exchange.  Works for me.  I don't "trade" altcoins, per se.  I just buy some now and then.  (And by now and then, I mean I buy about once every 2.5 years when I get all excited about the most recent runup.)
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:03:32
Right. That's why I really want to know how many people are using this stuff.
Realistically, this isn't going to replace fiat.  I mean, not everybody in the US invests in Google stock.  
When everybody is in, there's no new money to drive valuations higher.
But right now, the penetration in the US, China and India are pitiful.
Korea and Japan?  maybe a little better, but even so, it's still got a lot of room to run in those 2 countries, alone.
When I start hearing things like 5% of chinese and Indians have bitcoin, that's when I'll know that this thing has run out of new buyers.  Heck even at 1% or 2%, I'd start to be afraid that there are no new buyers out there.
But we're soooo far from there.  I still think 10X or 100X are possible.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:36:38
Okay. Stop.  Breathe.  
Your mom?  I hate to say this, and I don't know all the circumstances, but your mom is a grown adult who is responsible for herself and her actions.  
Maybe it's time to set some appropriate boundaries.  Like, you don't expect your mom to pay your bills and you won't pay hers.  I don't know.  Family relationships are complex.
But if you bought 10 BTC and sold them because times got tight, that means you were buying BTC with money that you couldn't afford to lose.  The money you bought your BTC with was money that you would need the first time things hit a bump in the road.
What you've lost is maybe $25,000.  You sound young. That sounds like a life-altering sum of money, but I'm telling you that it is not.  If you're like me, you'll make and lose sums of money like this many, many times over before your time on this rock is over.
So, if you still love BTC, then buy what you can afford. Even if it's $100 worth.  But make sure it's an amount you can afford.
Use your other money to DEFEND that position.  Overbuying into bitcoin is pretty much just as bad as underbuying.  If you are putting in money that you will need in order to eat or go to school, you're putting WAY too much money in.
Put in a modest sum.  This is not really an investment.  You can call it that.  You can think of it that way. But it's an asset like Gold that has very little intrinsic value.
It's only value is as a store of wealth or a way to conduct financial transactions.
Bitcoin could be worth $0 a year from now.  I don't think it will, but nobody can guarantee that it won't.  I always say, bitcoin will be worth $100,000 or $0.  Maybe even both at some point in time.  You can't know.
Buy back a little.  Don't let anybody know you have it, including your Mom.  Buy a little more every week or month.
I don't know your finances, but if you want bitcoin, buy $20 a week.    Buy $50 if you can afford more.
You feel like you missed out on this train and a once in a lifetime opportunity.
I'm telling you, that's not true.  I have felt the way you have felt countless times in my life.  
But other opportunities will come up.  We don't know when, or even what they will be, but there will be other opportunities.
And it's not too late for bitcoin.  You didn't buy in thinking that the run was going to be over at $2,800.  If this thing is going to run, it's going to run a lot farther than this.
So, buy back with what you can afford.
And for what it's worth, you sound young.  I wish I was as woke as you when I was your age.  Microsoft had its IPO in 1986 and if I had invested, I'd be a retired gozillionaire by now.
I didn't, because I had no clue about tech company IPOs when I was 21 years old.  Didn't even know what they were.
You are light years ahead of where I was at your age.  
So, even though you're not asking for advice, my advice would be, if you're young:
1.  Keep looking for this type of opportunity.  You spotted it once. You'll spot it again. 
2.  If you want to be in bitcoin, get into bitcoin.  You didn't get into this to quit when it hit $2,800.  If it gets to $30,000, that'd be like a 10X return on your investment.  That's just good money, I don't care who you are.
3.  Make sure you are investing in YOURSELF!  More important than bitcoin is to make sure you're continuing and furthering your investment in the most important thing a person can have in a knowledge economy:  your mind.  If you're not in college get in college.  If you graduated from college, get a graduate degree.  Make sure you're earning a living that gives you money that lets you defend your position in your home-run swings like bitcoin.
4.  Learn your lesson.  Get back in if you want and HODL.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:01:56
It wasn't stupid.  Heck, if you HAD bought into bitcoin, where would you have kept them?  Plenty of stories of people who bought bitcoin and lost the passwords or the hard drives or whatever.
If you had them in mt gox, they'd be gone.
Nobody knew for sure where this thing was going.  
But you know, now.  Or you should.  You can't do anything about the past.  That's something none of us can do.
All you can do is take the information available to you RIGHT NOW, TODAY and act on it.
(This is not, by the way, saying you should buy bitcoin. Only you can know that.  It's just saying you shouldn't beat yourself up for not buying bitcoin back when folks had no idea what it was or if it'd even be around in a month or two.)
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:50:49
Yes, I think it's very good news if your goal is to hold bitcoin and see it appreciate in value.
It will appreciate in value so long as demand exceeds supply.
If one in every 10 households in the US had a bitcoin wallet, I'd be thinking this is the end of the run.  Bitcoin would be huge and stabilizing.
But so long as bitcoin only occupies a SMALL portion of the global ecosystem, then that means there are a lot of people who are NOT into bitcoin today who may get into it tomorrow.
When we run out of people who are going to get into it, we won't see these big price runups.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:14:10
I'm exactly where you are.
If I put $1,000 into BTC, I don't really increase my bitcoin position by very much.  But if I run into a bump in the road, financially, and need that money?  I just screwed myself.  Might have to sell my BTC during a dip.
So, I like to think that my other money is used to DEFEND my position in bitcoin.  The stronger my financial position is, the less risk I have of needing to sell BTC to meet some crisis.
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:20:01
This is still in the early adopter phase.  I am literally the only person I know who holds any bitcoin.  There are only a few million people in the world who have ever held any. There's a lot of runway ahead of us.  :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:53:25
2,550 on coinbase.  
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:23:43
Unfortunately, bitcoin exchanges are local and bitcoin doesn't have the infrastructure to have the price the same on all exchanges at once.
Although you are PAYING more in Korea, if this situation continues, when you go to sell, you can SELL for more as well.
Best of luck to you.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:06:38
Good luck to you.

Great to see, isn't it?  We won't know until hindsight when we can't do anything about it, but there's a chance we're headed up now.  If so, that was the mildest bitcoin crash I've ever seen.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:51:32
Comments on the recent price action:
* Well, still remains to be seen, but it looks like the folks who predicted a crash might not get their wish.  Looks an awful lot like we're settling into a trading range above 23,500.  Could be wrong, this is bitcoin after all.  (CBWTIBAA).
* Looking at the price chart, it looks like somebody is buying big blocks at even price increments.  That looks a lot like institutional buying.  (For instance, the price will stay at 2,500 for a while. Then, at 2525 for a while.  Then at 2475 for a while.)
This is bad, too, since it means whomever is buying those big blocks is finding more than enough folks willing to sell.
I couldn't figure out whether this indicated institutional buyers or sellers, but I think at this point, it looks like buyers. That, of course, means a lot of sellers.  (You need a buyer and a seller for a transaction.)
What this means long term?  IDK.  Depends on how much they're buying.  Hahaa!
* Looks like maybe a weak double-top which would indicate a crash through previous support.  So, for chartists, it looks like maybe we'll see prices below 2,350 soon.  IDK, though.  I'm not willing to bet either for or against this.
* Saw SOOOO many posts in the past few days that were like, "I bought at 2,700.... this thing is going all the way down!  I sold this morning."
Ummm... so, you locked in a $400 loss.  If you'd just held on, you'd have made up half of that in a day.  
* I will advise folks who haven't thought about this, that humans have been conditioned for hundreds of thousands of years to do EXACTLY what you can't do if you want to make money.
Humans will want to sell when the price is falling. Humans will want to buy when the price is rising.
This is our very nature as human beings.  We would not have survived as a species if we weren't drawn to good things and repelled by bad things.
Trouble is, with buying and selling stuff in a market, this leads us to act exactly opposite of how we need to in order to make money.
And lest it appear that I am some wise person, the reason I say all this stuff is that I am the opposite of that.  I'm the idiot who stands in a room of people who say "don't touch the stove, it's hot" and then touches it anyway because I have to see for myself.
These are lessons learned the hard way.
Final parting words:  the class of investors who does best?  
Dead people.  
Yep.  Folks who die and can no longer **** around with their investment choices outperform almost every other class of investor.
So, buy it.  Forget you have it.  Don't **** with it.
You can't time the market. Anybody who claims you can is stupid, naive, or lying.
Best of luck, everybody. Buy ONLY what you can afford.  As far as I'm concerned, Bitcoin has only slightly better odds than blackjack.  
In blackjack you can win about 48% of the time.  That 2% is enough that the casino builds a giant castle to live in.
Bitcoin?  I figure it has about a 51% chance of making me rich.  Which I also figure means it has about a 49% chance of losing money.
Live your life.  Don't be dumb.  Throw a tiny amount of mad money into bitcoin and enjoy the ride.

Well, I did do it now, and I probably will regret it tomorrow.
Sometimes you can do both, but I'll be doing small weekly buys rather than making one big buy.  That way I won't lose sleep over the timing of the purchase.

good question. I'm hoping the support level is 1800, but I'm guessing, just like anybody else.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:22:49
I'm going to presume that this post is real and not some sort of put-on.
1.  NO, JESUS CHRIST, ARE YOU INSANE?  DO NOT PUT ALL YOUR MONEY INTO BITCOIN!!!  
if you have $500,000, then yeah, maybe put $32,000 into bitcoin.  But FFS, do not put everything you have into this.
2.  Others have suggested this, but you should diversify.  At a minimum, get a low-fee indexed mutual fund account.  If you're in Belize, IDK... can you get banking with the british somehow?  If you want to be risky, stick a quarter of your money into a russell 2000 indexed fund.
3.  Put a quarter?  So, maybe $8,000 into bitcoin if you REALLY want to take a home-run swing that could end up losing you all your money.
4.  Keep some money in cash and cash equivalents.  Maybe you have no expenses, now, but who knows.  Next year, you may meet a young lady or man and want to start a family.  You'll want something on hand.  Maybe there'll be an emergency.  Who knows.
So, short answer:  no.  Only a fool would do that, and only a fool would advise you to do that.
Put in a quarter.  Or maybe a half?  You're young and you can recover from losing all your money if you do.  
But put some of it into something more substantial.
Best of luck. And the more I type, the more I'm sure this is a put-on.

@_date: 2017-05-25 21:24:15
A speculative bubble, where overly exuberant people bid the price of something up beyond what's reasonable, then it crashes down afterwards.
In the past, Bitcoin would ROCKET up and then come crashing down to a more reasonable (yet still higher) level.
This time, though, we're nowhere near the runups they had in the past (yet.)
Like, if memory serves, most of the runups in the past were huge, from like $20 to 300 or from $150 to 1200.  Haven't had one since that 1200 one in 2013. Some folks think this is one, but really, this runup is mild compared to the ones we've seen in the past.
Might be a bubble.  Might not. We'll know for 100% sure after it's over and there's nothing we can do about it.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:43:06
Hmmm... Okay, think of it like this.
You have a market. Forget bitcoins.  Let's say the market is... IDK... bananas.
and you're at a market and there are 20 bananas available.
and you have 20 customers, each wanting 1 banana.
And everybody thinks that bananas are worth $1.00, each.
So, in that market, bananas will exchange for $1.00.
BUT, now we have 2 more people who want bananas.
The sellers can't satisfy everybody.
So, they raise the price of bananas.
And then, somebody else says, "oh, wow, I have 100 bananas.  If the price ever gets to $1.20, I'll sell my bananas."
Until those 100 bananas are gone, the price of bananas can't get higher than $1.20.
Once those bananas are gone?  Depends on a lot of stuff. Did people get discouraged and decide they don't want bananas anymore because it was just a little too nerve-wracking to buy a banana that day?
Did everybody who needed a banana get one?
When somebody puts a huge block of bitcoin for sale, that means that they're basically putting a cap on the price.  
What happens after that huge block is gone?
Depends.  Are people now discouraged?  Did everybody who wanted a banana get one?
There's no real way to know.  Depends on way too many moving parts for anybody to ever really guess.

@_date: 2017-05-26 21:20:30

@_date: 2017-05-29 14:59:46
Actually, I can't really buy that much BTC these days, relative to what I already have.
But I was bored during the dip.  So, I played a game where I allowed myself to buy every time it crashed through a $100 increment.  it was NOT a lot of buying.  I just don't have that much money.  I added 3% to my bitcoin position with my little game.
(The game, btw, was not about money so much.  It was more about finding something to do to keep myself occupied so I wouldn't get bored and tempted to sell.)
Now, we've stabilized over $2,200.  I made 9 purchases at pretty much every price level.  (Including one buy at like 2380).  But overall, my purchases, if you look at all of them, are in the money as of today.  I'm up 3%.
So, that's a good illustration of buying on the dips, though, honestly, it's insane that I'm back in the black so quickly.  
The key, I think, is to be disciplined.  If you want to follow Buffett's advice:  be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.
Human nature tells us to BUY!  BUY!  BUY!  When the price is rising.
Human nature tells us to SELL!  SELL!  SELL!  When the price is falling.
That is a recipe to buy high and sell low.  
So, on the runups, I'll probably just watch.  When the inevitable correction happens, the smart thing to do is nothing.
I'm not a smart man.
So, the 2nd smartest thing to do is to NOT do something that equates to buy high, sell low.  I'll try to be greedy when others are fearful.
In this case, I set up a game where I bought a little when it fell.  A little more if it fell a little more.  A little more yet if it fell even more.
In that way, I was trying to re-wire my brain to EMBRACE the fall, not to panic during it.
It worked this time.  Maybe it'll work next time.

I kind of agree with eustan that trying to guess 10 years out is a little crazy.
in 10 years, honestly, I think bitcoin will be worth somewhere between a million dollars for one BTC or zero.
Seriously.  In 10 years, it'll either prove to be bullet-proof and have destroyed all other competitors, or some flaw in bitcoin will have destroyed it, or it'll have been surpassed by a competitor.
So, $0 and a million dollars.  That's my opinion. Chose a value somewhere between those two and you're likely to be right.
However, if you have some mad money. Seriously, money you just want to **** around with?  Like you don't need it for school or food.  You have a little OTHER money that you can use if you hit some sort of emergency in the short-term.  
If you have MAD money, hell, throw it in here and in 2 years maybe it'll be 10X what it is today.
Or it could be zero. Which is why you only do this with mad money.

@_date: 2017-05-28 14:32:55
Mine is maybe 40% crypto, but not because I PUT that much in.  I bought some crypto 3 years ago.  At the time, IDK, it was maybe 10%?
Crypto has grown far more quickly than my other stuff.  And I can only put so much money into my other stuff all the time.
Probably depends a lot on where you get in or how long you've been in.  If you're somebody who got in at less than $100, then you might be way overheld in crypto.
If you just consider it mad money and let it run, who knows where it can take you.
I do know this:  my other investments have a good chance at allowing me to retire on schedule.  
Crypto?  has a SMALL chance of allowing me to retire early, and a small chance of being worthless.
So, as long as I'm funding my other investments, I feel as though it's okay to have a home-run swing with crypto in there, too.
But another few runs like this and my crypto will dwarf everything else I've got.

Holy cow, folks.  If all you're trying to do is make 10% intraday, wow... you're going to lose all your money.  All of it.  
I was buying today.  If it drops lower, I'll buy again.  I don't see it breaking through below 1800 and if it gets there I'll buy a lot.  
Long-term I think we all got a glimpse of what 10,000 per bitcoin would look like and we know it's not that far off.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:00:14
that's actually my biggest realistic fear on this.  That the price will drop to... IDK... like $1,200 over the next few months, then languish for months and months, eventually selling for as little as $600.
That's what the last runup did.  Lots of things different this time, though.  We'll see.
The runup wasn't nearly as severe and the time table was REALLY compressed in 2017 versus 2013.  So, more of a blip than a bubble.  
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:35:53
Unlike people who guess, I actually do survey people on this topic every 6 months.  Out of 200 students who I teach about dark web and cyber currency, maybe a quarter at most have ever heard of Bitcoin every semester.  These are millennials who are way more tech savvy than older folks.  
YOU think everyone knows about it because YOU know about it.  
Instead of guessing, just informally ask at your next family gathering.  "How many of you have heard of Bitcoin?". I bet you get a quarter at best.
If you then ask "how many of you know how to buy Bitcoin?". It would be surprising if anyone other than you said yes.

I think even if they SOLD, they'll be the ones who take us to 10K.
By that, I mean, let's take a person who bought at, IDK, $2,500.
Lots of folks did.  
And now they're kicking themselves. They lost 20%!!!!
So, they sell.  They lost some money. They're licking their wounds. They're telling themselves that bitcoin is not real.  It was stupid to buy bitcoin. They'll never fall for that **** again.
And in a year or 2 or 3, when bitcoin hits like $4,000, they'll be sitting back thinking, "OH ****!!!  Why didn't I hold on to my bitcoin!!!  Oh well..."
And they'll sit there and watch it break $5,000.  Then, $6,000.  Then, they'll pile in.
And it'll hit $12,000, then crash all the way back to, IDK... $4,000...
But they'll finally understand what it means to HODL.
Folks on this board forget, that not only doesn't everybody own bitcoin, but the vast majority of people have no idea how you even go about buying any.
You have to pop that cherry before they can become a pornstar.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:38:37
No, not at all.  Honestly, I'd never advise anybody to get into bitcoin unless they want to be in it. This is a risky, speculative asset that absolutely could go to zero in the future.
And just trust me:  I own very little bitcoin. So, encouraging others to buy is not going to have any impact at all on my finances.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:41:05
My personal opinion is that it all depends on India and China. They're both HUGE countries and they're populated by savers.  Once bitcoin reaches any sort of penetration in those countries (doesn't have to be 100%.  Honestly, once you have even 2% of folks in China and India storing their wealth in bitcoin, the valuation will absolutely skyrocket.)
The risk factors are:
1.  Maybe bitcoin won't ever really catch fire in those countries.
2.  Maybe there'll be a technological glitch that kills bitcoin.
3.  Maybe some other alt currency will surpass bitcoin.
All 3 of those are realistic concerns.  
But if none of those happen, bitcoin will be unlike anything we've ever seen.

That quote is hilarious!  I agree.  Linux.  Yep, it went away... so, if you were one of the fools who bothered to learn it 10 years ago, you're probably only making like $120,000 a year as a linux sysadmin right about now.
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:42:30
It was actually making me crazy. So, I had to do something.
I wanted to buy, but catching a falling knife is dangerous and difficult.
So, I let myself buy a tiny amount every time it broke another $100 mark.  (So, buy some when it went below $2,400, 2,300, etc.)
Now, of course, I'm regretting that I didn't buy MORE.  I barely accumulated anything additional.  But it served its purpose:  kept my mind occupied during the downturn.  It wasn't really to try and score a quick profit.  It was to keep my mind occupied until things weren't so frothy.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:27:16

I will not say that you should or should not buy bitcoin.  My personal opinion is that bitcoin will go to either $100,000 or to zero. And frankly, I find both possibilities to be realistic.
That being said, I've been on this rock a few spins and one thing I know for sure:  you cannot time the market.  
If you want to buy something, the time to buy is now.  
(Or as the old saying goes:  the best time to buy an appreciating asset is last year.  The second best time is now.)

They do, and the people who are into bitcoin love it.
The chinese government hates it.  You can't manipulate a currency that you don't control.

Listen to BashCo.
A few things to consider:  
1.  Anybody can say anything on the internet.  
2.  Even if a person is telling the truth, there's no way to know if they knew what they were doing or just got lucky.
3.  Only YOU will have to live with the consequences of your decision.  Make it wisely.
4.  Just a word of advice (and yeah, blow it off... this, too... is advice over the internet), but almost nobody is built to make money trading things.  If you follow your gut, you will buy high and sell low because you will want to buy when the price is climbing, then sell when it is falling.
5.  Treat this like a mad-money bet.  Be okay with the idea of losing 100% of anything you put into bitcoin.  The bitcoin road is littered with people who lost everything.  Bitcoin exchanges have crashed.  People have lost access to their wallets.  Bitcoins have been stolen.  
This is the wild west.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:11:39

To me, the best part of this is how MODEST that increase is. Saw another article where India is adding 2,500 bitcoin wallets a day.
In a country the size of India?  Or 40,000 relative to a country the size of the US?
This is AWESOME because it means we're STILL way early in the early adoption phase.
Folks STILL don't really know what this stuff is.  It's still basically a secret.
Go to your typical middle-class working person in America and ask them if they hold any bitcoin. They probably don't know what one is, but they sure as heck don't know how they can buy one.
When everybody knows how to buy one, that means that we're running out of buyers.  
Until then, unless something takes the legs out from under this, it's got room to continue to run.

@_date: 2017-05-28 16:30:29
Yes. That's exactly what you should do.
My story?  Overbought Bitcoin in 2014.  I ended up selling most of it because I ran into some bumps in the road and it was the only money I had.  What I sold, I lost money on.  Lots of money.  Like, bitcoins I had bought for $550, I was selling for $350.
I put 10 bitcoins into the vault at coinbase.  Then, literally forgot I had them.
Fast forward to today.  Bitcoin is going nuts.  I'm beside myself because I WANTED to hold, but was just too poor to.  I open up my coinbase account to see if maybe there's at least some bitcoin dust in there.
Lo and behold, I've got bitcoins. Didn't even realize I had them. Had forgotten completely about them.
So, yes, your plan is, frankly, the smartest thing you could possibly do.  
(The only other thing and I don't even know if this was possible when I was buying this stuff back in 2014, is to set up a recurring buy.  So, you by, IDK, $100 every month or whatever you can afford and won't miss. That way if bitcoin goes into a long slump, you'll still benefit. And bitcoin DID go into a long slump after I bought.  Like I said, I bought at like $550 and it did a slow glide-path down to $250.  If I had been buying $200 worth every month for the past 2 years, I'd be even happier than I am today.)
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:38:29
At the risk of sounding racist, Asians are savers.  (I am Asian, BTW.)  If they get to the point where bitcoin is the tool they use to save, this thing is going to go nuts.  India and China, if they got even the tiniest penetration in this space, would drive the price to 6 or 7 figure valuations.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:39:02
No, not kidding.  Bought some bitcoin 3 years ago.  Have only started paying attention to it this week.
So, if you go to buy a sandwich, you're looking at a multi-dollar transaction fee?  Yeah, that's a problem.

I agree that millions is a bit crazy.  Like... yeah, in 50 years if it outright replaces a handful of currencies?  IDK... pretty much EVERYTHING would have to go right for this to happen and that's just not a realistic thing.
But honestly, $2,000 bitcoin was a fantasy 5 years ago.  Like a crazy-ass, you need to get professional help type fantasy.  
And now, I think we have a taste and see that $3,000 bitcoin isn't a crazy thing.  It's more likely than not.  Just a question of whether it'll be in 2017 or 2019.  No way to know.
And if we can have $3,000 bitcoin, we can have $10,000 bitcoin.
So, use your imagination.  I agree that a million bucks for a bitcoin is nutty.  But hell, you used to be able to have a silver dollar that contained a dollar's worth of silver.  Now, that same amount of silver is like $18.
If we get an 18X runup in bitcoin prices?  That'll be a life-altering sum of money for me and a lot of other HODLers.

Looks like we may break through $2,000 support on coinbase. Ready to buy when that happens.
I don't know which rung on the ladder will be the lowest one, but I'm buying on each rung we fall.

All we can know for sure is that what you just said has been accurate so far.
Driving by using your rear view mirror is a shitty way to drive.
But it sure as **** beats driving without being able to see anything at all.
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:48:06
I'm cautiously optimistic with you.

Funny how we're seeing resistance at every increment.
Obviously, a bunch of guys who had a ton of bitcoin had told themselves they'd sell some at $2,800.  Same will happen at $3,000, I think.  (I doubt it'll happen at $2,900... that's just not the way human minds work.)
So, there's probably a giant ton of coins available at $2,800 which will keep the price from punching through for a little bit.
Then, when it does, I anticipate a smooth run to $3,000.
I'm also thinking this runup has the markings of institutional money going into bitcoin.
What I mean there is that in a typical bubble, people are all worked up and are like, "OMG, MUST BUY NOW!!!" and throw money at the asset.
You can act that crazy if you're investing small sums.  (Small, being relative. That could mean $100 to some people or $10,000 to others.)
But if you're an institutional investor who is going to move, say, $10 million into an asset, you don't dump in one gigantic buy order at whatever the market price is.
If you do, you drive up the cost of the asset and then it immediately plummets when your buy order is finally filled.  That means you lost money, immediately.
Institutional investors, when placing a gigantic order, move into the position smoothly so as not to cause a disruption of the market.
This move up is not like the ones before where something increases 10 fold in a day.  This is a smooth gradual runup.
I bet it's mostly Australia and Japan driving this, with a few big institutional investors getting in before this thing takes off.
Also, once the Winklevoss brothers create an ETF, you might see things like 401(k) plans buying into this thing.
The potential is just amazing.  I don't think talk of six figures is crazy at all. And a long-term potential for seven figures is not out of the question.
Just my personal thoughts on the matter.

Have you considered that maybe you should put your money in something that's not quite so speculative and volatile?
Not trying to be a smartass, but this isn't for everybody.  
Don't buy into things that will make you lose sleep.  
Throw your money into an S&amp;P indexed fund with Vanguard, or buy some shares of Alphabet and sleep soundly at night.

Haha!  Well, you know I hope you're right!  Looks like we might have gotten our feet under us, finally.

That's actually pretty much the mildest Bitcoin bubble ever.
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:32:13
+1 on the "greater than 4% or zero".
My opinion?  2 or 3 years from now?  Bitcoin will be worth more like $20,000- $50,000 per coin.  
Or zero.  This is a high risk, high potential yield proposition.  And it could be zero.  Don't put money you need into this.

farrrkkkk... god, I've been getting ripped off in coinbase.
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:46:41
Yeah.  It cost me an unnecessary few hundred bucks, but this will be more important in a few years when I cash out so I can retire.  ;)
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:32:04
Good luck man.  I am buying eth now, tho
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:08:55
No, I won't be able to retire on my eth.  Not unless it goes to 5 figures
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:03:25
can't debate with you.  I agree with you.
