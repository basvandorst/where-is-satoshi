Yeah, $1 trillion might be the market cap but you have to realize that it'd be a deflationary system, not inflationary like a fiat currency. Although you may be right, gold may not be feasibly subdividable for such an economy. Bitcoin is suitable, though, and with a maximum of 21 million coins it has a market cap too.

Wanna x-post this to We don't get very many quality posts and this is pretty relevant.

Oh wait, it's peaceful when guys with guns prevent me from voluntarily trading with people who reside in a different geological location than I? Huh

How big is the image? Should it run on a 4GB SD card?

Sorry I was unclear. I do believe that 300 BTC and also the stock thingie should be supplied. Why can't one (or all) of us supply the bitcoin and he buy the stock? Shouldn't matter, right?

You said it only matches up in one out of every eight ways. But wouldn't it be one out of four? 
Or does the code need to be vertical for it to register? (Sorry I'm not familiar with QR)

Libertarians were the first to hop on the bitcoin train Btw, and has been on the sidebar since the beginning.

That's a really nuanced argument my friend. 
If this were the 1960s, would you have told MLK the same thing? I bet you would have. 
Moreover, the moral obligation is not for the aggressed upon to remedy the situation, it's for the aggressor. If the mafia comes to your neighborhood and demands tribute from you and your neighbors (and for whatever reason you can't force them out - ie they bought out your local police or something, doesn't matter) why should you give up your home? The mafia are the aggressors, why is it up to you to leave when you're not committing the wrongdoing?

So Jeff Bezos is the CEO of bitcoin then.

Nah those probably aren't real downvotes. Reddit has a vote fuzzing algorithm that automatically adds upvotes and downvotes to mask the real values. It's a bot prevention thing.

Oh sorry I think you were late to the thread (I just read the edits). At first OP wanted to supply 300 BTC and someone else to buy the stock. But now I see that changed :)

Bulldogs are great dogs. I had one for about ten years before she had major problems and we had to put her down. Such a good (if smelly!) dog

I think you underestimate how big a dummie I am.

Right but it's winner take all. As long as both parties supply equal funds (ie one or the other BTC or the stock thingie) then why does it matter who buys what? It doesn't.

Cause I only have like 1.2 Bitcoin and I didn't think it was worth it - I'm not a market expert I don't magically know when it will go up and down

Bought in at $900 so fuck me. I'm just going to hold and hold and hold and hold.

No that is not government. Governance =/= government. Government requires a monopoly of violence (ie police and army forces) to exist. Free market DRO's could provide laws to abide by and protection, while not forcibly stealing from its constituents.

Wrong. The opportunity cost of losing the coins is $46k, not $50.

Any other ideology practically unanimously endorsing bitcoin?

I'm willing to bet it's exactly 1000 mBTC.
