Define soon?

Accurate from my POV. Given the breadth of currencies abound, though, how does one sufficiently spread and balance their investment?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:51:15
Yeah, I tend to agree.

Lightning will make or break Bitcoin, IMO. If it hits next year then the price should surge. If not, I can see an overtake until it does but think it will still surge after. Distributed base of ownership and the most name recognition.

Can you source that? I found this: 
This indicates a decentralized ownership base with no majority influence possible at current time. Though, that said, it appear bitcoin cash, while less decentralized, also has a broadish base of ownership.

What crypto do you see people adopting which offers a distributed base of ownership, name recognition, and a finite enough supply to enable high scale ROI numbers? There are so many altcoins. I see ripple as interesting but the large pool negates the high ROI and others do not have a great space in the pack. Large scale adoption is the metric which I see success tied to. Perhaps a “fed coin” will end up doing that.

I agree. The field is moving quickly.

Good arguments. I'm transitioning into an altcoin, maybe two, which have good whitepaper fundamentals and market potential. There are multiple roads down the path. That said, it is eye-opening how many coins exist in the market right now without solid fundamentals. The hype train is real.

I meant ownership of coin to influence the market as we saw recently with the concerted push against Bitcoin by Bitcoin Cash which caused a destabilization effect and forced correction.

My issue with bitcoin cash or Bcash is the lack of decentralization of ownership. When a large percentage of the coin is owned by a few, and being manipulated aggressively, the small investors are left at the whims of their choices. The Blockchain increase is a perk which Bitcoin doesn’t currently have but it is also a stopgap measure and not a true solution.
As a student and lower income investor, I hope bitcoin slumps, so that I can buy up to a goal amount, before lighting is implemented. If it can be implemented successfully, I see the years curve of valuation continuing.

Remember to throw up the finger in parting. Gotta keep it classy.
