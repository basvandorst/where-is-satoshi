What problem are you having on what part of the instructions?
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:18:48
Someone should compare the rich list before and after the price drop.
@_date: 2011-06-10 20:26:01
What price did you buy the majority of your coins at?
@_date: 2011-09-18 21:19:04
This site will get "hacked" and you will lose your coins.
@_date: 2011-06-07 22:28:28
There are free transactions and the 0.01 that occurs sometimes is being reduced in later client versions to something like 0.0005.
@_date: 2011-06-08 10:01:11
I just told you the site is still up, keep spreading misinformation though.
@_date: 2011-08-29 12:56:49
brave move
@_date: 2011-06-07 14:12:41
It's probably mtgox or a mining pool or some other group effort.
@_date: 2011-09-17 18:40:45
What are solidcoins?
@_date: 2011-06-08 09:17:41
*dark pool. lol
@_date: 2011-06-10 00:06:19
Why would I send you anything?
@_date: 2011-08-17 22:59:36
End up at that value or touch for a second some time before then?
@_date: 2011-06-04 21:17:19
I am also quite fascinated by Bitcoins. Are you Jewish?
@_date: 2011-06-05 18:47:49
adjusting the price to match the exchange rate and selling the coins could be a problem
@_date: 2011-06-07 15:31:45
From 2010 when the price was very low. Misleading comment.

It's scary how news articles can be so inaccurate. If the reporters/editors don't fact check it's no better than a random tweet.
@_date: 2011-06-07 22:26:29
Huh?! The dollars come from other users who have paid to deposit them.
@_date: 2011-06-07 14:41:17
Where's the Mtgox quote from?
@_date: 2011-06-10 11:57:35
What about the mining pool transactions?
@_date: 2011-07-10 11:16:21
cool idea, needs more description though
@_date: 2011-06-15 17:12:02
Please would someone link me to the story about the guy who lost half a million?
@_date: 2011-06-10 18:43:34
There are transaction fees though.
@_date: 2011-06-05 21:34:10
Yes this is not a small risk and likely reason for the higher price.
@_date: 2011-06-05 21:29:53
It's only a problem at the moment and only for people who can't automatically adjust their prices easily. Selling is only a problem for novices.
