When I ran for state senate in the Austin area 8 years ago I raised $15,000. A little over 1/2 went to a campaign manager who set up events for me and also helped out by responding to the media while I was busy with my day job. I also made campaign posters, stickers and DVDs, however the campaign items were difficult to distribute.
I had a blast and ended up with just under 20% of the vote in a two way race against former mayor Kirk Watson. The highlight for me is that I got to debate Watson and a number of his supporters who were on hand admitted to my supporters that I won the debate. However I could not get the media to admit to that or even report on the debate even though I sent out many copies of the event on my campaign DVD.

I played a week's worth of poker in Vegas (including some at the WSOP) and successfully used the Robocoin ATM at "The D" downtown which means I didn't have to fly into or out of town with my entire bankroll. I am not highly recommending the ATM for a variety of reasons, but at least it worked fine accept on the one day when it was out of cash.The D also accepts bitcoin in their gift shop, restaurant and front desk. Their diner on the second floor is pretty darn good.

Wikipedia says: "Fiat money is money that derives its value from government regulation or law. The term fiat currency is used when a fiat money is used as the main currency of the country."
Ergo bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to date are not fiat currency.
There is a cost to transactions in crypto-currencies including bitcoin. It is small compared to credit cards for a variety of reasons which you can research easily enough.
There are countries looking seriously as adopting crypto-currencies as their primary currency, but these may or may not be true 'fiat' style currencies depending on whether or not the country retains the right to "rewrite" the rules on the fly with regards to the creation of new coins.
As long as the ROI for political contributions returns about 20 to 1, there will be problems with campaign finance. Reduce the scope and power of government and therefore the possible ROI. In my opinion that is the best way to address the root cause of corruption in the political system.

It is impossible for you to win this particular race due to the "Straight Party Ballot" voting mechanism in Texas. However it is great that you are running in this particular district as there are many people in that area looking for alternatives.
Now your opponent could be attacked on corruption charges as the evidence for that is out there, but I think that there is no real point to doing that. Instead you should be finding ways to engage individual voters and help them to understand why your positions make sense. Winning the hearts and minds of influential people in the community and other base building activities should be the primary focus.
If you can locate other strong voices for liberty in your district, think about giving them an official title in your campaign. If you can raise enough money to hire a part time campaign manager and/or event coordinator that would be good (assuming that you have the time to actually attend events in person.) Don't worry about the mass marketing stuff like signs or pamphlets unless you raise a lot more money than you anticipate.
There are a lot of former and current LP candidates and campaign workers and even some current and past office holders in the greater Austin area and so be sure to reach out to them if you get hung up on any details.

When I go to Vegas to play poker I take half of my bankroll in cash and half in bitcoin. If it turns out that I need to dip into the second half of my bankroll, the ATM at the D is very handy in case I can't find a local bitcoins or other willing trading partner.
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:18:08
Thanks for making that clear. Let me clear up another thing that your example got wrong and that some commenters do not seem to get. NASDAQ will not be using the blockchain (aka colored coins) to track trades on their public exchange. The trades that they will be tracking are private placements for not yet public companies. These securities are generally not traded once they are obtained and they are later redeemed for actual shares in the targeted company once that company goes public. (It is also possible for already public companies to make private placements, but it is not clear whether or not the blockchain will be used to track these securities.)
Now it seems that using colored coins will make these securities tradable, but it is possible that this will not be allowed since there are restrictions on who is qualified to hold these securities in most cases. Rather the intent is to take advantage of the transparency and reliability of the blockchain to track these holdings replacing the current scheme that uses spreadsheets managed by the lawyers and accountants in charge of the private placement.

The user interface definitely does some rounding for presentation purposes. For example, the Coinbase FAQ says that the accounts with over 5 BTC have their total BTC rounded to two places.
Remember that the purpose of coinbase is to gain traction with less sophisticated users and showing a large number of places is not something that most people would find comfortable. Now if the API returned rounded numbers, I would not like that at all.

To say nothing of rampant inflation in China as well as a general preference for gold and other precious metals in a number of growing Asian economies.

I was 25 and already an experienced pro programmer when I got my commodore 64 which I used to learn a bunch of different programming languages including assembly language. Later I switched to the Amiga because I could make my mind up for myself about new technologies.
I got into bitcoin when it was under $5. Again I simply evaluated the tech behind it for myself and it seemed to me like it would work and it was useful. I also liked Satoshi's view on politics which were in line with my own. I have never really invested in bitcoin, but I have used it several dozen times to buy and sell goods and services and as a useful way to move money when I travel.
I have done some coding around bitcoin 2.0, but since I live in the US I have never been enamored with having to deal with financial regulations and so I have never pulled the trigger on launching any bitcoin related projects. So sad that the "land of the free" is not really the best place to be for bitcoin coders. Still in all bitcoin has been a useful adjunct to my various hobbies and so it has been a useful enough technology although not really life changing. It works and that is good enough.

First, I have bought BTC from coinbase when the price was rising and had no problem with the transaction.
Second, Coinbase is handling a crush of orders with only 2 people in the company. They do this by relying on a software-based fraud detection algorithm that admittedly occasionally ensnares people trying to make honest transactions. They are tuning this algorithm so that it throws fewer and fewer false positives and, in the meantime, they are dealing with customers who have issues on a case by case basis.
Obviously they are not giving out the details of their fraud detection algorithm, but some hints have been given including: start with a small transaction; keep them small and occasional for the first month; don't significantly ramp up the size or number of transactions until 30 days have passed from your first successful transaction. Also I believe that using the slower bank verification process (small deposit and etc.) is better for avoiding their software tripwire.

You cannot design my solution for me. I reserve that right. I just pointed out to you that there is a fair system for independent order matching when you said there is none. Do not confuse my existence proof for a generalized solution.
The algorithm used needs to match the characteristics of the market. NASDAQ is in the process of changing the matching algorithm for ECN trading to a best price earliest order system since their best price largest order system was not cutting it. I don't pretend to know enough about the particulars of the bitcoin marketplace to suggest a best algorithm for a full service exchange, but there are different possible choices and they affect the implementation details.

@_date: 2013-04-12 19:00:33
You can shout all you want, but without specifying the required characteristics of the matching system and the algorithm employed to match those requirements, you cannot know for sure the extent that locking is required. There are a variety of mechanisms available to discover, negotiate and execute closely matched orders. Some allow for limited foms of distributed processing. Others do not.
Regardless, you are assuming that the Mt. Gox bottleneck is in the order matching system. I do not. It is entirely possible that the bottlenecks being addressed are in creating and maintaining in increased number of user sessions. If this is where the bottleneck is occurring, then you have to admit that incrementally buying new computers is not the smartest way forward. Sure you want to grow your server farm over time to reduce cloud expenses, but you keep the exchange operating smoothly with expandable cloud-based resources. It is the way things are done in the real world of the modern internet.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:46:03
Personal experience. I have helped several dozen third party candidates with their campaigns and run a few myself. The disclosure and reporting requirements are easily the biggest impediment to recruiting more and better candidates. On top of that, many of the more onerous rules kick in after you raise more than $5,000 or $50,000 (depending on the office sought) and this fact encourages many third party candidates to purposely raise little or no money meaning that they are not running serious campaigns.
On top of all this, the commission that oversees campaign finance reporting is made up of 1/2 Democrats and 1/2 Republicans. They often dole out little or no fines for campaign reporting infractions unless you are running as an independent or third party candidate. In that case you are slammed.

@_date: 2013-04-12 17:17:12
There are commercially deployed order matching systems that do not require a database to work. They handle more volume per unit time than Mt. Gox has ever handled.
Building scalable systems is hard. I never said otherwise.
The modern way to provide scalable performance without touching a system is to automatically bring more instances online when they are needed and drop them  when they are not. That is a far cry from Mt. Gox's approach to scalability which appears to be rather adhoc. I am sure that replacing non-scalable RDBMS backends with better technology is going to be a major theme in the remainder of my career.

Hmm. I recently purchased some coins using coinbase at roughly $15.5 and by the time the transaction cleared they were worth a lot more. They didn't cancel the order nor did they try to welch out of the deal in any way. Of course I didn't leave the coins on coinbase. I never do that since they are not an online bank AFAIC, just a service provider.
Before using coinbase the first time, I read all I could find out aboiut the operator. I noticed his background in credit card fraud and so I realized that some people with poor credit and/or have a history with credit card abuse or such were going to have problems with coinbase, but frankly I think coinbase has to be ultra-conservative about their operations to make this thing work on such sim margins. The service has worked well enough for me that I am willling toi give them the benefit of the doubt for the time being.

Jeffrey was brilliant but got a few details wrong. For example, bitcoins do not scale infinitely. Maybe 8 decimal places seems infinite, but it is not.
Also I have tried to wrap my head about what it means for a bitcoin-based company to go public and, frankly, there are some interesting challenges with that. Corporations will manipulate their shares (which is their own private currency) all the time and only heavy regulation keeps that practice to an acceptable minimum (although, in many cases, the regulation is not enough to prevent abuse. Many chinese/penny stocks get away with highway robbery.) Since bitcoin tends to resist regulation and government oversight, it will require new software inventions to create tradable corporate shares.

The idea is to use EC2 "on demand" for times of high transactions. When the market cools down, the extra servers are taken offline avoiding the higher costs of the amazon instances.

@_date: 2013-04-24 18:12:25
Institutionalized corruption goes back way before the Super PACs. It was the forced reporting of campaign donations that showed up in 1972 that allowed corporate bosses to impose their political preferences on their senior executives (I.e., your donations better show up on the campaign reports and fall in line with the corporate preference or else your cushy senior exec job career will be in jeopardy.)
Of course before that the wealthy leaders would just write big checks themselves. However don't think for a minute that all of the campaign finance reporting laws have had any effect other than to increase the concentration of power in the federal branch of government. The increase in campaign money is a direct consequence of that concentrated power leading to the fact that investing in politics has been one of the best investments that a corporate entity can make. The power and the money go hand in hand. Personally I see no way out for the citizenry.
