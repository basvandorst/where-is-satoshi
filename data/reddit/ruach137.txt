I understand and agree with the sentiment here, about a government seeking to pacify its population. However, I think pegging that to gun control is a little misguided. I used to be much more "pro gun" despite being pretty liberal (I'm from the South, so old habits die hard). Originally, the right to bare arms was a measure for people to combat a tyrannical government, which is what you are outlining here. Back in the late 1700s, it was largely musket v. musket (+ a few cannons on the military's side). But these days, the idea that a loosely organized militia could take semi auto assault rifles and use it in open resistance to the most well funded professional army in the world is pretty laughable. Never in military history have civilians been so outmatched by the military. 
The truth is, firearms can really only be used effectively against individuals: whether that be self defense or terrorism. If citizens ever became the enemy, there wouldn't be much of a fight. 
I've had to come to terms with the fact that my pro gun leanings stem from the fact that I just like guns. I grew up with them, target shooting, hunting...Some of my friends spout off about how "we need guns because the govt has guns". That makes me laugh. If the government ever openly targeted civilians, a gun is the last thing I'd want to be holding.

Yeah, despite plastic's many serious downsides, it has done A LOT for our development and wealth. It wouldn't be used at all if it didn't have real utility.

That really sucks...
Have they discovered any kind of purpose behind this attack?
Are there any vulnerabilities where players might have lost some of their bitcoins/had them stolen?
