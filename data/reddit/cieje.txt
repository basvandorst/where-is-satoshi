I secured my wallet today pretty well. Here's what I did:
* Using truecrypt, I created a local truecrypt container file/volume of 2GB. 
* I mounted this as a drive letter. 
* I copied the contents of my Bitcoin appdata\roaming folder to the mounted drive.
* Adjusted bitcoin client shortcut to: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\bitcoin.exe" -datadir=X:\Bitcoin (X being the mounted drive letter)
* Launch shortcut to make sure it's working. 
* Make sure to disable bitcoin's client from auto starting with windows.
* Close bitcoin client completely
* Created another truecrypt container on my dropbox. This time about 10MB
* Mounted that new volume as a different drive letter
* Made a batch file that does this: "copy X:\Bitcoin\wallet.dat Z:\wallet.dat" (X again being the 2GB volume, Z being the dropbox volume)
* Dismount all volumes
By doing this I have my entire bitcoin data/wallet encrypted on my local HDD and an encrypted backup of my wallet on my dropbox. This does need to be done manually though. To do this I:
* Mount 2GB bitcoin encrypted container
* Run the now modified bitcoin client shortcut
* It updates transactions, I then completely close client
* Mount dropbox encrypted container
* Copy wallet file from 2GB container to dropbox container (via batch file)
* Unmount all volumes
I don't know if this is the best way to do this... but it seems fairly secure. That way I never have a loose wallet file on my pc unencrypted and accessible. It may also be a good idea to copy the file from dropbox to multiple locations such as email, a flash drive, cd, whatever.

Here's 2 calculators:
neither one takes into account the eventual increasing difficulty rating (meaning less profit for the same amount of hash processing), but it'll give you some idea.

I think they're all about the same. If you're using windows then guiminer is pretty straight forward.

is that with phoenix? for some reason I can't get phoenix to work at all. I just sits there and doesn't do anything whenever I try to use it. 
@_date: 2011-06-14 19:58:58
to answer the question, the 6750 or 6790 most likely
@_date: 2011-06-14 22:09:07
have it solo mine. Maybe you'll get lucky and score a block =)

I personally think it's worth it. Even with the difficulty increase. Using this calculator:
You can set the difficulty, hash, price and see the bottomline and how you like the outcome. Even at 1000 Mhash/s you still make over $700/mo  
@_date: 2011-06-18 01:42:09
exactly. Since a GPU has other use for the normal user, and most likely better resell value
@_date: 2011-06-18 19:02:19
umm no. At least not in the USA. cash it out and pay her with that.
@_date: 2011-06-14 03:48:50
The dremel mod is because that MB is almost half the cost of something with 3 16x slots. by removing part of a 1x slot you can simply put a 16x card in. It's just a cost savings for something fairly simple... but you would be voiding your MB warranty so that's something to consider.
And again, the 2 power supplies I think is because of cost. a 1000W supply is most likely more expensive than 2 standard PSUs
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:41:14
if that's true, as you describe, it's impossible for mtgox to let kevin keep his bitcoins since they're not even real.

So far I think it's more stable than 11.7 was.
win7 x64 1x5830 w/ core OC sometimes between 926 and 970
@_date: 2011-06-14 15:04:57
sure, if it's free why wouldn't it be worth it? could be like 1-15 Mhash/s depending on the cpu. 
I find guiminer to be very easy to use. YMMV
@_date: 2011-06-16 03:05:25
as long as the bitcoin stays at about $20 it should pay for itself in about a month, and then be making more than $15k per month. looks pretty good to me
@_date: 2011-06-17 15:45:18
have you ever gotten any funds?
@_date: 2011-06-20 13:49:09
with the mtgox problems you never know. The closer we get to 6 blocks/hr the lower the difficulty change will be. It was 9.93/hr yesterday and today it's 9.63. The day before it was over 10

I don't know. If by some miracle I end up having $500k worth of bitcoins in my wallet I sure as hell am pretty worried about my bitcoin wallet. 
I'm not really worried about someone specifically having access. I'm more worried about infections/scripts designed to find/steal the wallet.dat file in some automated way. Also worried about deletion, corruption, or hardware failure of some sort.
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:49:40
I proposed in the livechat with MTgox: BitGate - mostly because I think there's more in the story we have yet to hear...

what is it you'd like to know?
I'd say decide on how many Mhash/s you're interested in based on your budget. In a single physical PC, non-water cooled, you're somewhat limited to 3 GPUs at most IMO.
Common desired video cards: ATI 5830, 5850, 5870, 6950, 6970, 6990... and everything in-between those models TBH look at this chart:
Here's a guideline: 
1GPU 500W PSU, 
2GPU 750W PSU, 
3GPU 1000W PSU, 
3x6990 1200W PSU.
Get the cheapest CPU for whatever MB you select. Select a MB based on how many video cards you may ever want. You only need 1 stick of RAM, 1-2GB depending on linux vs windows.
Hope some of this helps

I was there too (dabomb in chat) and I felt that everything TH said in the first hour sounded very scripted between the host (bruce) and adam, the TH rep. However, the "email guy" from Mt Gox sounded genuine with all of his responses and was more fluid with his responses.
However, I am still unclear why an auditor was needed or what an auditor was doing with this sort of information. So it sounds fishy personally. I don't think I'll continue doing business with Mt gox unless their response/tone changes in some way.
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:46:04
without miners there wouldn't be any more bitcoins... how is that food for thought?

it's "pray" tell not "prey" Prey with an "e" is what you are to a lion with a bloody limp out on the Serengeti.
@_date: 2011-06-18 01:44:38
as long as the store can verify you have available funds... and no outstanding unresolved trades exceeding the amount required... should be ok
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:43:48
I just know that I remember reading that Mt gox would work with authorities etc etc... and all of a sudden they have an auditor... a government auditor? who knows, but it all sounds fishy
@_date: 2011-06-15 11:37:22
In my case, I have plenty of spare motherboards, ram, cpus, psus laying around (at least enough to build... 10-15 1-2 card rigs). So all I need to invest in is appropriate video cards.
I can't speak for OP or others. But if you try to keep it on the cheap and maximize your potential appropriately I think you can make profit for the new 6-12 months as long as it stays after say $10 or so.

using guiminer I'm getting 240ish at stock (800), 280-285 at 926 and 290-295 at 960.
I find that if I want to watch h.264 content or play any games (such as swtor beta ;) ) I need to use stock core or the driver craps out. But when the PC is idle I use 926.
I have the PC in a room that is not air conditioned during the day, I live in Florida, so with fan at 100% it stays under 73C at 926 and gives me decent Mhash/s
@_date: 2011-06-14 20:49:35
OP said "Ability to buy in bulk at large quantities." so you couldn't do that with a 5830 or 5850.

Thanks for the info. I'll make sure not to rely on it as my only backup.
@_date: 2011-06-15 18:12:53
just computer repair. people decide to discard old pcs for various reasons; that they are old, they had a bad HDD, bad MB, too costly to repair etc. So I have quite a few full desktop PCs with PCI-Express x16 slots that just need some TLC or maybe a couple capacitors replaced etc.
@_date: 2011-07-13 18:13:46
nice, throw some casters on it and you're good to go!
@_date: 2011-06-15 15:38:07
Get like a 6950, 6970, 6990 (whatever is in your price range) that has 2 or 3 pci-e x16 slots spaced out decent. Get one or more (your budget) and add in later if you desire to increase Mhash/s capability. You'd also be able to crossfire any in the same series for increased gaming capability.
that's my .00000002 BTC
@_date: 2011-06-15 15:00:55
yea... sorry doesn't seem like a good idea to run something like this. Make the source code all open and put it on github or something and let the masses determine how useful/valid it is
@_date: 2011-06-17 15:31:05
does your bitcoin client show connections? is this the only bitcoin client using this wallet/hash? 
I just cashed some out from MTRed last night and it went through I think within 15min at the most
@_date: 2011-08-26 04:01:37
Just go to goodwill or snoop around on craigslist. All you need is a working system with 1 pci-e slot (doesn't even need to be 16x). I'm sure you can get a whole system for under $50.
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:37:42
@_date: 2011-08-22 21:46:43
Umm yea... $400 or whatever for something equal to like a $50 video card? no thanks. It would have to be at least 1:1 Mhash/s vs USD before it made any sense I think. Right now, power usage not included, A card can easily do 3:1 perf vs price. There's no way that investing in like 20 of these cards is as profitable as 20 video cards at 1/3 of the cost but triple to quadruple the performance. Sure, the power may be a lot less, but on a short term ROI the video cards are way better. It's not like we'll be mining for 10 years or something.
@_date: 2011-06-18 01:45:46
I believe there is a setting by default under options to enable it
@_date: 2011-06-15 02:34:07
internet connection has no baring on mining aside from provided the needed connection; speed doesn't matter.
computer rig doesn't even matter, it's all about the GPUs, specifically ATI/AMD based.
@_date: 2011-08-23 13:20:15
I get nearly 300 Mhash/s for $130 on my 5830. the device in question seems to do 100 Mhash/s for $400. I don't think it's out of the equation to assume people are doing 3:1 on their video cards (with like a 6990, or a better optimized card than mine)
@_date: 2011-06-15 13:39:09
I'm slightly confused by this. If I set a password on the wallet file will the bitcoin client be able to write information to it still?
@_date: 2011-06-21 16:19:32
sounds like you should start your own show.
Part of their "shtick" is it's a 24/7 live entertainment/news/discussion online tv station. They want to show transparency or something like it.
@_date: 2011-06-16 02:47:25
The network rules are such that the difficulty is adjusted to keep block production to approximately 1 block per 10 minutes. Thus, the more miners engage in the mining activity, the more difficult it becomes for each individual miner to produce a block.
There may or may not be a correlation between difficulty and price... maybe somebody more knowledgeable than I can chime in concerning that fact. What I do know is it is possible for the difficulty to stay the same and to even fall; it has does this in the past.
@_date: 2011-06-14 03:54:50
(he's crapping his pants right now...) $785/month!&gt;!&gt;!?!?!?
@_date: 2011-06-13 15:18:08
check the time/date on your computer
@_date: 2011-06-17 15:50:14
well, assuming you copy/pasted your payment hash... I would personally backup the wallet.dat file... install the client software on another PC, move that backed up wallet over, and see what a different pc does.
process of elimination. That way we eliminate where the issue isn't
@_date: 2011-06-15 14:55:03
most people will say to buy bitcoins.
If your power is free, I think mining is without a doubt still profitable. If you pay for power... it could be a wash depending on exactly how you plan out your rig and how much you spend on it.
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:53:34
I kept saying in the online interview... why can't TH or MTgox just be open source so everybody can agree on what should or shouldn't be done...
@_date: 2011-06-18 01:41:05
it's true. If they would just secure the bitcoin client and it's data on the client side it'll help a lot. Then if the market websites can get secured well enough everything will be honkey-dory
@_date: 2011-06-17 15:27:41
nice, thanks
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:57:14
in the interview... I believe Mt Gox said that was an internal xfer of bitcoins to a non-server location (like moving to a wallet)
@_date: 2011-06-16 16:37:34
If we do some general estimates: let's say $20k in equipment. 20Ghash/s. 20000W electricity. (200W per card x 100 cards) 0.10 kWh energy cost. That's 13729.52 USD gross before electric and 12268.52 USD after. So yes, more than 1 month to break even at those numbers. However, based on the picture, this is possibly in a data center/industrial type of location. So power consumption may be much less if even a factor. Also, I estimated 200 M/hash/s per card; it could be more than that. The cost could even be $5k or less than quoted.
@_date: 2011-07-13 18:05:32
no 5830? :-/
@_date: 2011-06-16 04:19:49
it'll still be profitable. And if it goes above $20... it'll balance out or even be more profitable. 
@_date: 2011-06-18 19:39:13
I personally think that by 4th Q 2011... it'll only be huge operations that farming with these. The little guys will be gone by then.
