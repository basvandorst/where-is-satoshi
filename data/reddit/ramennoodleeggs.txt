Does anybody have the feeling that the govenment Is behind cryptocurrencies and they dropped Bitcoin on the world when they were good and ready? Here me out. They would have alot to gain by colluding with other governments and covertly introducing something like this in an environment that they control and have clear access and whatnot. don't get me wrong if the government was behind it then they probably secretly want it to succeed. It will be very useful for people to use as proof of an alibi and stuff in court. What if cops start doing Micro payments when they pull people over as a "proof of Fine/ticket" or whatever. It just seems fishy to me to think the Governments were not aware of the possibility of a new paradigm in Cash which conveniently coincides with everybody getting Smart phones over the last 10 years (product saturation) of recession and suppressed wages. now Without the trouble of fixing the Broken financial system (which has become entrenched and parasitic and has infiltrated the government) We can shed all that with some new borderless systems and this will hopefully ease some of the Burdens on our populations for the common man in a gentle way that is more of a smooth transition into a new world economy. Its Obvious that Decentralized Self sustaining Programmable Opensource Blockchains are soon going to be coming to Usurp Clumsy assed Government systems. It will probably take 15 to 25 years Before we see some nice Government implementation of Blockchain for govenment services
