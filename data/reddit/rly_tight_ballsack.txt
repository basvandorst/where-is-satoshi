There’s a lot of pros and cons, and a whole big picture to look at. Didn’t mean to come across toxic.
These silly fees are a necessity for the health of the network. There are advantages and disadvantages to increasing the block size and making fees less, eg. When block rewards become less and less in the future years, the transaction fees must be an incentive to keep the network secure. (Stack sats)
And then you have lightning, which will benefit you when you want to buy bubblegum.
DYOR and understand the marketcap of BTC compared to the likes of gold.
Security of the network is paramount.

Yea u rite. Halving in just under a years time and 0 fungibility. 3.5-6k my prediction. ��

There is no free transactions to family or friends or anyone. The minimum fee is 1 sat/byte, no such thing as free. If you do send a tx with 0 fee it will be in a never confirming state and will return back to the origin wallet. (This is why bitcoin isn't 0-conf and you must wait for atleast 1-6 confirmations + you have replace by fee)
The fee is there to keep the miners honest, if there was no fee or if it wasn't worthwhile, they would make more money going rogue.
This is the reason why Bitcoin is the most secure decentralized ledger to date. And to add a little extra, nodes are just as vital as miners. You help with decentralization of the network and keep/distribute an honest copy of the blockchain. (Bitcoin Core is a node/great wallet)  
If you want to go deeper, and talk about the negative enviromental aspect of mining, there is none. Clean energy like hydro is becoming the norm including solar + wind. Proof of Work will always be most secure algorithm compared to Proof of Stake, take Nano for example. I don't hold Nano but its PoS, instant, feeless. Sounds amazing but Binance holds a great deal of weight and "could" collude with another high weight representative. (deny transactions or render the network unusable) - With PoW this isn't likely as there is the incentive to be honest.  
Fact: if Bitcoin today was running on the Proof of Stake algorithm, Apple alone could render bitcoin worthless just by holding a majority stake.
Apple Market Cap: 920B
BTC Market Cap: 192B
I'm baked as hell but I hope you learn something.

Fuck it, buy high sell low for maximum returns.

No point in selling at all, price is irrelevant.

The list may be a little outdated, i've just checked coinbase pro and to deposit BTC they offer the wrapped segwit address - begins with '3'. So you can send to coinbase pro from your bech32 address and withdraw to bech32.
Legacy addresses begining with '1' can't send to bech32 addresses  
Compatibility addresses or wrapped segwit begining with '3' can send/receive to both legacy and bech32 addresses  
bech32 'bc1' can send/receive to '3' and 'bc1' and uses less space compared to legacy addresses &amp; wrapped segwit addresses
Hope that helps :)

Scroll down to see a list of exchanges that support native segwit bech32 addresses.

I’m also having problems solo mining on 0.18.0.
Though I don’t use stratum, just cgminer -&gt; core, it’s showing as waiting for work. 
Works fine on 0.17.1, any help please?

I’m not disagreeing with you, I’m just stating the facts which you consider implications.
Storage + Bandwidth are not a problem, even if the size of the blockchain was to be 16Tb in 10 years time, as an example. Node sync will not take any longer as by then we may have 1Tb download/upload and storage is becoming cheaper.
The problem we have is on-boarding. Everyone must go through layer 1 to reach layer 2. You have to bare in mind that the world population isn’t using bitcoin at this moment and already we see layer 1 is congested. This will prevent mass adoption, as Bob isn’t going wait 3 days to top up his LN wallet. 
Something needs to be done.

The chain won't be too big in the future with increased blocksize, storage space is not a problem and never will be.
