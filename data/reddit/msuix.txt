funny guy
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:55:19
Yeah its been 2 hours. Lmao why did you even post.
Nobody likes anxiety.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:57:26
Your code is most definitely incorrect.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:57:42
he really doesn't think of the consequences after all!

$16k was my initial investment, though the actual value at time of closing was closer to $40k.
I will tell myself I lost $16k and sleep somewhat better.

This is not really worth it guys. There isn't even a guarantee that the password is what he says it is. Think about it.
Lets assume we're using the wordlist used in OSX after cleaning non-ascii words and garbage:
cat /usr/share/dict/words | python cleanwordlist.py | wc -l
**229084 words**
We then break up the words by length:
    "1": 26,
    "2": 160,
    "3": 1420,
    "4": 5272,
    "5": 10230,
    "6": 17706,
    "7": 23869,
    "8": 29989,
    "9": 32403,
    "10": 30878,
    "11": 26013,
    "12": 20462,
    "13": 14939,
    "14": 9765,
    "15": 5925
Then we determine all "3 word" possible word lengths that add up to 17 characters (18th character is a single digit 0-9). From there we also include all possible **ordering** of these words, and all possible 0-9 variations tacked on the end of each possibility.
**Simplified:** *Each entry includes all orderings of those words using the words of those lengths in the wordlist. Meaning [1,1,15] includes 1,1,15, 1,15,1, 15,1,1, and so on*
[1, 1, 15]: 240318000 possibilities
[1, 2, 14]: 2437344000 possibilities
[1, 3, 13]: 33092872800 possibilities

Let's assume a 50% success rate estimate (similar to vanitygen) and even use a modified vanitygen to utilize the efficiency of C. Vanitygen on a quadcore 2.4Ghz Xeon I had laying around was about 1.27M keys/s. Unfortunately that is not an accurate estimate for our use case, as determining a brainwallet and jumbling memory of all the word possibilities takes more of a toll than simply randoming x bytes for a private key.
As someone previously mentioned in the comments a feasible 173K passes/s (which is fairly realistic IMO), lets run with those numbers.
**Total: 787221499456800 possibilities / 2 = 393610749728400 tries for 50% probabalistic success.**
At 173K/s, thats:
12481314.99646119 **Years.**
If you tried to narrow it down to most probable combinations, like a set of these:
[4, 5, 8] : 97043012510400 possibilities
[4, 6, 7] : 133684586268480 possibilities
[5, 5, 7] : 149877604206000 possibilities
[5, 6, 6] : 192427795216800 possibilities
[3, 4, 10]: 13869607123200 possibilities
*That's 586902605324880 possibilities*
At 173K/s, thats:
*18610559.52958143 Years. (50% - 9305279.76 Years)*
If you want an exercise in bruteforcing, sure knock yourself out. These can obviously be reduced by throwing more machines at the problem, but is it worth 6BTC? No. Is it worth 6BTC on the word of someone on the internet (I suppose according to comments a known troll) that could just be pulling your leg and sending you on a wild goose chase? **Absolutely not.**

Peruse these tweets and make your own conclusion: 
Let's watch what unfolds.

I love that people are downvoting a legitimate discussion topic where people can come and be up to date on all the relevant information of the allegation.
really is a circlejerk of only positive news. hah.

If this supposed large sum (0.75M bitcoins) was really unaccounted for / missing / stolen, then one shady individual has a massive, massive share of the bitcoin ecosystem. I fear this cannot be good in the longrun for liquidity of our precious infant Bitcoin.

thanks for the kind words, I'm sure we all appreciate it.

Have you talked to your lawyer yet? I'm falling asleep. If we're talking about a realistic release in 8 or more hours from now, please do us the service of letting us know (and me personally, for some shuteye).
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:44:54
Waiting on the rest I guess. Doesn't look like too bad of a plan. Let's see what happened.
