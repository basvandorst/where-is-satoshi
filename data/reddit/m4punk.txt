I have a rough estimate of my monthly profit expectation based on the kW/h, hardware costs and pool fees of a couple pools I am looking at. I guess a lot of people don't do their DD here and you are assuming I haven't either. Regardless, your comment doesn't really answer my question.

While the bigger miners would prioritize large blocks (if that's even how it works, I'm really not to sure) the small pools would focus on the smaller blocks. Everybody is happy, transactions take seconds to confirm and everybody is making money.

I was thinking something along the lines of blocks expanding and shrinking based on the demand at any given time. Miners wouldn't control how large or small blocks are. But yea I could see that being a problem if the miners could control the size of the blocks.

So I was thinking volume would be a good measure of "demand".
