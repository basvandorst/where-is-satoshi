*Dat comeback tho!*
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:46:35
So as with everything it all was underestimated, and reality always surprises!
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:34:35
So in which case you *do* get the forked coins?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:11:43
The last dip i have never bought in was 9100 about 3 weeks ago, that feels like an illusion now .

when you think of yourself as a 'global citizen' you're more willing to contribute :)

25K next week easy!
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:44:32
Nice one! Why don't you buy some real estate though ?
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:30:57
Anyway, i didn't look proper into Quantum Computers ability to wreck Bitcoin, but what are the eventual risks? Can Bitcoin really become obsolete in a blink of an eye one day?
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:18:51
Exactly. Still i see a lot of people attach themselves to that 'original' vision and purpose which has evolved long since.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:34:04
ok 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:29:27
I bought in for the first time two days ago when it dropped to 15,700 ! Yesterday i made my second purchase at 14,000 ! i'm chill and hodling, this is exciting, scooping them dips !:-))))
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:40:03
why does Reddit have only two stickies available?
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:20:33
Perfect catch!
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:54:30
Can a purpose evolve and change over time?
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:23:29
Perfect catch!
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:23:12
don't think soooooooooo, don't take off your spacesuit just yet!
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:31:39
you can sell to me no problem !
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:33:22
xrp is very attractive, but their vision contradicts the potential high increase of the xrp price. do you really think it's going up to $1 or 20$ within a year or two ?

25K by Feb, HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:45:05
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:43:59
in 4K too! this post made me watch it from that timestamp, and the ending is developing to a ridiculous extent lol
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:44:39
Bitstamp is dope!
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:24:19
buckle u-u-u-p!
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:31:42
don't you see any reason to cash out completely and buy some real estate for example ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:24:18
15K today feels like everyone is holding their breath
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:41:51
So i started watching from that moment, and this movie is pretty epic :D
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:27:30
haha i love this community, honestly
with such commitment bitcoin is invincible!; )
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:42:33
Thought the same, observed the price on Thu dropped to 9100, now it's back up to 11k+ and not sure if it makes sense to wait for it to drop again. I guess it's another wave up now !:)
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:44:18
more like 12.4 kg ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:29:40
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:27:07
Sorry what is bictoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:34:33
you will discover yourself and realize your creative potential bringing something unique of yours to the world and making it a better place; )
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:11:34
So how much can you expect say in 1 year ?
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:07:54
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:44:25
bro, i saw the stupid links in the description and closed your vid instantly. Just stop :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:18:08
Don't know how you made this, but it looks dope, ridiculous, nice !:D
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:01:30
not at all: 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:28:39
good question! there're 180+ moons in the Solar System!
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:17:16
So when is the best time to declare the bitcoin victory thou! :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:19:16
Oh yeah, of course it was much more recently than it actually feels with these fluctuations! That dip was basically last Thursday, ha!
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:34:49
Why didn't you mention the full vid this clip is from? :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:18:42

RemindMe! 1 week "What's bitcoin price now?"
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:31:17
Interesting. Curious to see where it all goes in the next years.
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:11:46
Don't wait for correction, wait for another 3-400 dip and get on-board &gt;&gt;&gt; profit???
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:34:46
Which exchange would you recommend?
And do all exchanges require ID verif?
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:34:20
In times like this, always remember the guy who paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas !
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:29:38
WOw, really ??
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:50:22
Let me know if you get your fiat back. Apparently lots of people having issues withdrawing their cash. Please share your updates as you go along solving your situation.
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:13:23
I don't even see any correction upcoming, were there any corrections before? Looks like only short small dips are happening which gives a quick opportunity to buy-in, but other than that there's a huge influx of cash and the wave only keeps going. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:18:33
I feel the same, there looks to be only small dips every now and then, and the major upward wave just keeps going. The exposure for bitcoin only increasing, and everyone jumping in. It really seems like going to the Moon!
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:16:19
Drop a 500 and forget about it until 2020-s. I guess you'll be very thankful to your past-self .
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:41:26
How about you travel around the worrrld. Twice!
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:10:57
This is not investment though isn't it. When you buy a phone or a tv, do you consider that an investment as well ?
@_date: 2019-08-30 06:51:37
Such a brilliant country in many levels!
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:21:45
Bro, i hope you get so rich that you can continue your hobby forever! This is awesome.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:29:21
i even got an acc on bitstamp and use their tradeview, but got carried away with my daily stuff, only hearing about the major milestones being breached again and again, and now this, 10K, wow! hoping for a quick dip in the next week or two, then i'll start DCA
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:13:15
I hesitated to buy since 3K lol. WTF
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:22:01
That's really neat!
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:37:27
If it goes to even 8K so many millions will pour into so it'll fly high  again quickly
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:06:17

Just found this, read on:
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:22:32
So much new knowledge is very illusive for uninitiated !
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:31:00
Can i start GDax right away?
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:48:15
I'm in UK. Registered previously with cex.io and deposited some cash, then read all the reviews about them. Now can't get my money back out of them, lol. I'm looking into Bitstamp, do you have anything to say about them? I'm loving the tradeview so far, but haven't registered yet.
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:41:26
Now just don't go to sleep!
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:52:58
thanks captain obvious
all in!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:24:24
what is this magic? this is mega cool, So how do I make one?
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:58:12
bro, i've seen a similar post here already. this looks too sketchy imo. the guy expects people to PM him , like people usually do on similar posts, and who knows what happens next . or is it just a fake post for karma?
