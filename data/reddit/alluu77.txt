Thanks that helped a lot, I got reddit not too long ago and used to think it was a bunch of retards but now I’m actually learning so much new perspective from all you cognizant redditers out there.

Yea you guys are honestly all right. Bitcoin is is moving a billion dollars everyday, users are increasing by the millions, hash rate is increasing despite these dips the past few months.
One the reasons I did invest in ETH though is because of all the other coins using its platform (which would raise value of ETH) and it’s different structure that allows you to do real world things that bitcoin can’t.
Really leaning towards BTC after all the feedback thought. Thanks!

So basically the power of quantum computing could hack private keys and infiltrate the blockchain but not until they become much more powerful which won’t be for decades? ( I skimmed through them btw, a little busy right now and didn’t read the whole thing so I might have missed something)

Hey everyone! I’m looking for some advice about my crypto portfolio.
Currently, 75% of it is in BTC and the other 25% is in ETH. 
I’ve been thinking of going all in and putting everything into BTC.
Should I do it or not, and if I should or shouldn’t, why?
Edit: My apologies if this is the wrong question to ask in this discussion. It’s my first time here.

Why is it physically impossible to create that many qubits?

I see what you did there, best answer ever, kept in the shortest way possible and I completely know what you mean. (no sarcasm)

Damn, thank you, I never thought of ETH’s platform and it’s influence in that way. What I’m taking away from your thought is that it’s basically like a 1000 companies  “Shit coins” trying to copy a product that only one company (BTC) makes. But that one company has a few patents on the product and no (shitcoins) will attain its value and features.
Would that’d be right?

So you think I should put it all into BTC eh?
@_date: 2019-12-03 00:31:54
Very logical, I guess the FUD just got me a little paranoid. Got to keep emotions out of this market.

I put my seed on a word document and then put that document on a USB.

BTC reasons: limited supply/scarcity like no other form of investment created before, it’s been around for 10 years now with no hacks to the platform, halving cycles continuously increasing scarcity in turn increasing demand, all the companies/countries/big money investors putting their fiat into it
ETH reasons: In my opinion will most likely bring in a higher ROI (at least in the next bull market), the smart contracts and things it can do that BTC can’t, all the other shitcoins using its platform which would therefore increase the value of ETH

You’re talking about the cryptographic of the block chain right?

Yea I was thinking of the same thing! Idk how I feel about the market right now, it’s been pretty unpredictable these past few months. However, I also definitely think ETH will rise soon enough.
The thing is when it does go up, BTC is also going to go up at the same time which means depending on the ratio between them you may get more or less BTC when you trade the ETH. 
If I do trade it I’m going to find a good period to do it. A period where there’s a good ratio between ETH and BTC. By ratio I mean:
Say ETH is at 100 and and BTC is at 1000, then you would get 0.1 BTC from your trade.
But say if ETH is at 100 and BTC is at 500 then you would get 0.2 out of your trade getting more than the first scenario.

Yea I feel you on the ROI thing in the next bull market, that’s one of the only reasons I’m holding the ETH. But I also feel like BTC will be king long term and no one’s going to care for shitcoins.

Yea his comment gave me a different point of view but I completely agree with what your saying too. That’s actually one of the reasons I chose to invest in ETH.
