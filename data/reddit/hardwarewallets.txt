I can also recommend Cryptosteel for a save backup of your Recovery Seed of your hardware wallet.

I wrote a german review about the digital bitbox and I also noticed some of your points: 
Just wanted to add that U2F support is now given with the newest firmware 2.1.1 :)

Does this setup work with a dynamic public ip address? Each day I get a new IP address from my internet service provider, do I have disadvantages?

He said that he entered the public key to watch his addresses, not the private key. Can't see a problem here because it's watch-only. Could only be a privacy issue when someone can connect all your transactions.

Most secure way would be a hardware solution. 
You could try Opendime, which is a little device that can receive bitcoins. Then you give it away like cash. To release the private key to be able to spend them the device must be physically cracked by the receiver. But the balance can be checked at any time.
But for smaller amounts the app solution is totally ok in my opinion.

Can't wait for the ledger blue to be in stock again

The software of hardware wallets like trezor or ledger also shows the current value in USD or any other fiat. But you have to connect and unlock your hardware wallet to see the balance (except trezor wallet which can remember his device at trusted computers). An other option is to export your extended public key of your hardware wallet which is a watch only option for your wallet. You can import this key in any app which support them. But be aware that maybe the developer or hacker can maybe now see your transactions history too, so this could be a privacy issue.
