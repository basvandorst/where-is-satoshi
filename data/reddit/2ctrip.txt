@_date: 2018-05-23 11:45:36
bitcoin doesnt generate anything

Okey so what the fuck?
You think people will use a ponzi scheme(by definition its greater fools scheme you need new people to join to keep the price up) to keep their money "safe".
Would you rather have money on your bank account or in cash or in internet made value that fluctates 20%-30% monthly and is currently crashing.
How is money fucked?
Why are you looking at zimbabwe or venezuela some shitholes?
You think eur or usd will become worthless overnight?
Or will this happen to bitcoin that is alredy crashing daily?
How can money drop by thousands of percent? hahah im pretty sure it cant drop more then 99.9% lol.

it failed to break 10k, there is no volume we are still in bear market with small pumps here and there, you can see this with bart charts.
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:53:57
so instead of losing few % every year because of inflation you would rather lose 70% overnight?
yeah im sure everyone will use this

did eur lose 70% of its value in 3 months? does eur drop 10-20% each day?
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:41:44
lol are you so dumb that you cant understand the diffrence before it went mainstream and after?
it ran out of greater fools nobody is buying it anymore the hype is over.
everyone who was dumb enough to fall for the speculative bubble alredy joined and lowt their money and people are not coming back.
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:30:43
are you delusional? you actually think bitcoin will still recover after everyone realized it has no value and is not used for anything?
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:58:16
This is why the price crashed and will never come back.
Because of dumb guys like you who think that its a fact: BUTTCOIN WILL ALLWAYS INCREASE IN VALUE! Its allways dumb to sell.
What the fuck is wrong with you people?
Why would It allways increase?
Is it increasing at all this year?
Would it really be so dumb to sell it at 19k?
It was a bubble that popped,all hype no product or value.
Beanie babies,pokemon go,harlem shake,bitcoins. All just trends that people forget about in few months and they move on.

You delusional idiot, at that prices marketcap was tiny.
Past years have nothing to do with current market, all previous drops happend because of bad news.
Now its collapsing because people are rushing out of the sinking ship before it sinks completly.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:59:43
You never made anything, you only saw money on your digital screen.
You lost everything and now you still think you are not to late to get into get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:12:54
Lmao 
You mean every stupid gambler and taxi drivers?
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:55:45
lmao delusion
@_date: 2018-06-28 08:31:19
So you felt nervous when your magic tokens were worth a lot of real money, and now when you lost most of your money (70% ) now you feel calm?
You are delusional, you got lucky and got in early and you were to greedy to get out.
Now you are on a sinking ship and still wont get out with whats left of your money.
