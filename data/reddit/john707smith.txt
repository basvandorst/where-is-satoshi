The vision is that somebody can print this out and put on a bulletin board. I want this to be Bitcoin news at a glance, anywhere.

Human desires are not static. Bitcoin's price is not stable for that very reason.

Historically, computing power has not declined with price. In fact, it continues to rise regardless of price. 
It makes Bitcoin valuable because it makes Bitcoin hard to destroy. Yes, the value of Bitcoin comes from other things but those come after Bitcoin is actually sustaining. 
Bitcoin is backed by its computing power as other currency is backed by its governments. 
Additionally, miners have incentive beyond mining. Some are hobbyists that just like helping the Bitcoin cause out. 
The Bitcoin network will never just phase out due to lack of profit. The miners came before there were exchanges, remember?
My point is Bitcoin can have value and grow in value because of its computing power. To argue otherwise is ludicrous.

Bitcoin is held together by computing power.
That's all I ever meant.

Their verified status doesnt make them any better than Chang Noi's mining companies.
Take a look at Tygrr bonds.
Also, lol at thinking fake scanned IDs mean anything.

People desire security in their assets. They want something tangible enforcing its existence: That tangible thing is the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network is the strong sentinel that holds Bitcoin together. 
Many people value that. You may not.
I mean is it not rational to value Bitcoin based on its strength and will to live?
Is an asset that cannot be destroyed valuable based on that alone? Would a weak, inflatable currency be less desirable than something that cannot be destroyed?

Include all mining companies and let the people decide what they want to invest in then.
