blaming it ALL to Wall Street is delusional. They may have some play in there but it's not all that.
100% of my friends sold all of their coins due to tether uncertainty. go figure it out yourself.

Many people suspect bitfinex is printing ghost money (usdt) to hold btc price at the moment.
I am not in a position to tell whether it's true or not. well if it is, they can't do this forever. when they do down, everything WILL follow them. I cashed everything out of gdax and coinbase a few days ago. better safe than sorry.

if you trade on GDAX or Coinbase, then Fidelity is the way to go. They seem to have close relationship. It took just 1 day to transfer 10K+ from Gdax to my Fidelity brokerage account. I have never seen a hiccup.
Plus in terms of customer service, Fidelity wins hand down.

LN doesn't matter as long as the ghost of tether scam is still there.

with just $60, buy ARK instead, this coin amazing survived thoughout 2 week of turbulence. I am really not sure why, any one here cares to explain?

bittrex is the safe and easiest exchange for this coin.

it's totally up to u if u want to wait for a definitive news on tether's death to make the move. but I think most of us understand that it's extremely risky to hold tether on any exchange at the moment.

tell your bank to stop doing that because it's not cool.

I can smell that Fidelity is about to jump into Cryptocurrency trading business. This is huge.

FYI, in Vietnamese, "LON" refers to women's private part in an extremely insulting manner.

This Bitcoin thingy has proven to be even bigger than a country. Buy now and HODL, you will make more than your loss within a few months.

Based on this: 
"This implies that Bittrex might soon dump its Tether pairings"
No matter what will happen on Fed 6, anyone who hold tether should dump it asap.
