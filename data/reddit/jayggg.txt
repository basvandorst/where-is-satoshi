If you didn't keep it at 800 you wouldn't have kept it at 5000.

Did someone say Frappuccino? 
@_date: 2014-09-18 00:45:24
It's great and it's impossible to rip. Once gave me the new wallet somehow the old one got ripped to shit though? 
That's Tyvek for you.

It's ok, once bitcoins are worth $1 billion each this will have been totally worth it. Chin up, guys!

Coinkite is the only company I would trust with my coins, as they are being paid monthly to keep coins safe. I would not trust Coinbase, it really seems like amateur hour over there. If they didn't have VC backing I imagine they would have goxed us all by now.

Sent. Just the tip.

If I threw my bills in a furnace, or like, dropped them in a sewer, or like had them stolen by a transvestite hooker with scabies, could I get them back? 
@_date: 2016-03-31 04:14:51
Yeah, let's make ANOTHER product where you can steal money by bumping up to it. Oh no, but wait, it gets better, it's IRREVERSIBLE!

Baseband? Have you heard of it?
@_date: 2016-03-31 04:29:04

I'd rather donate in bitcoin, thanks for facilitating! When will the money be delivered to the red cross?
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:07:54
This is awesome, I can't wait to see the cheque with "from the bitcoin community" on it... &lt;3 So much love in this community!
