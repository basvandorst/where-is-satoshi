Can anyone link a good introduction/advanced video? 
I've been following the whole affair since ~2 years in kind of a on/off relationship and recently bought my first coin, but I feel that I'm missing something very basic which I can't quite put my finger on.
Also: Does the recent price drop have something to do with an US auction I read about some days ago? (I'meaning the last few days ~540eur-&gt;510eur) Or is this just normal volatility?
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:19:53

It's in an identical crisis, like people sometimes. Usually people who undergo such crisis are tougher at the end. Or dead sometimes. But not in 95% of cases. 
Let the system mature, I'm keen on what's happening.  
It really is fishy how Jihan (and Ver maybe?) tried to pull the hardfork off, but also I don't really know how much of an echochamber r/bitcoin actually is.
I favor the "core" solution more atm, simply because of perceived integrity. 
BCC can surely crash really fast, but on the other hand  I don't have information on which miners switched to mining the other chain in the meantime.
E: kk I will check accounts before I post something in the future. Should just have downvoted.

Apparently lots of newly released altcoins are more investormoney/kind of standard-stocks (from my marginal understanding) instead of actual payment systems.
On the other hand, some of them offer different solutions and applications of blockchain implementation. 
But what is the value of btc derived of tho? Or fiat money? We value arbitrary numbers.

9100$ at most. I don't think the 10k dip will be a heavy as anyone expects. But it's just a feeling, as always. 
Other scenario is that it just straightly chews through it to 12k then dips to sub 10k again and goes back up some days later.
In the back of my head something tells me that a lot of people will throw money at btc once it reaches 10k because fomo, then it will top out at 12k or something. I also think we are entering Mainstreammaniaphase, but 'm not sure if we actually are already into that phase by now.
Christmas conversations in families will have a big impact I think.

Who will run out of bitcoin? Do you control your private keys? If so, your dad can't do shit and you are in fact making your own decision. Nobody can take btc away from you if only you know your private key.
Also: Do YOU think it will be 0$? If the answer is no, then see above.
