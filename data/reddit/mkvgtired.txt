He regularly posts on Alpha as fuck.
Edit: next time you want to destroy something with a gun, check out Tannerite.

I don't have it unfortunately. On my phone right now, but that was the reasoning behind this video. 
It was only the first 5 people though.

Not sure if you saw the topic yesterday, but someone on was buying Nexus 5s for people that destroyed their iPhones. He wasn't doing it for karma.

There is an off brand at cabellas. I used a 2.5 pound container and had to reassemble my dads railroad tie backstop. 
is basically a bunch of 15 year olds that make fun of 'beta' guys and talk about 'getting pussy'. 
Alpha as fuck bro, you're clearly beta as fuck.

Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to have their head examined.

Inflation of their local currency and scarcity. People dont trust the Peso, so they are hoarding things they believe will be less inflationary. Here [is a chart]( of the official and unofficial exchange rates for USD/ARS. The price of dollars is soaring there as well, in Peso terms. That is the key distinction.

A major difference between Argentina and Cyprus is Cyprus' currency is a reserve currency backed by many other economies. Capital controls are really the main problem you guys ran into. 
In Argentina they would most likely have similar capital controls to what you guys had, but with a plummeting currency as well.

Dont have any funds in my account, but campbx seems to take security very seriously. They even offer Google Authenticator which has a constantly regenerating numerical key sent to your smart phone to log into your account. 
They also have features like stop-loss orders. I'm in the US so it works for me, but they only trade in USD which can be a downside for international customers (although they state they have plans to serve the Eurozone). 
I am not affiliated with them in any way, but they seem to have the most robust platform I have seen, and it seems like they take security seriously.

I think this will be much worse than Cyprus because Argentina has a national currency and Cyprus had the Euro to fall back on. So not only will the nation try to curb capital flight with capital controls and trading restrictions (like in Cyprus) but the Argentinian Peso will be plumiting in value compared to other currencies. 
I will be a very bad situation, probably more similar to Argentina's financial crisis in the 90's. 
Was reading another news source that said (from memory), "although not officially announced, it is assumed that these changes were directed by the government."

If you're concerned about people killing themselves why do you keep insulting them?
I agree that people investing in any asset should read a book on both technical analysis and quantitative analysis. Bitcoin was exhibiting perfect signs of a bubble. That said, if you know a bit more about the subject than people on here maybe you could try offering them advice that might help them in the future instead of insulting them.

I am looking into CampBx. It is based in the US. It does not trade in Euros yet, but they stated they are trying to offer service to the Eurozone (maybe via a subsidiary based there?). They also have daily tests by McAfee and you can use Google Authenticator to access your account. It is basically the new version of those old regenerative code keys people used to carry around. 
It also has a more feature rich platform that allows stop loss orders, etc. Emailed them about funding, but thats probably where I am going to be trading.

What is the black market exchange right now? I decided to take classes instead of go to South America, but was definitely adjusting trip costs in Argentina based on the fluctuating black market rate.

From what I have read this was not capability installed by the hardware company, but rather the result of NSA hacking.
So even a new brand would be susceptible to the same thing.
