Merry Christmas! I would love one of these. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:52:00
What's the alternative?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:50:52
Says $250 for me.  Thanks for the response.  Has been impossible to get help from coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:51:34
Did you just sign up?
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:33:25
So I have to spend that amount and then wait for a month for them to increase it ?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:12:57
Just trying to distract myself from the upsie downsies. =]
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:09:09
Have had a ticket open for 3 days now, no response. =[

"Localbitcoin" is essentially dropping cash into western union to an unknown person or business. All the other major sites, even with CC require ID checks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:10:20
Did exactly the same!
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:48:33
Jesus Christ those prices !  Thanks for the link though.

I wasn't able to sign Up with them. I'm from Texas and they're not authorized to give me an account.

A governmental collapse/ country in post war doesn't mean the end of the world man. Lots of places with ultra inflation and ultra corruption or are recovering from a devastating war still have electricity and internet.

Jesus.  Wtf!

Power in major cities would take a hit and be spotty for sure. there would likely be enough people around wanting to keep their food cold or run AC they could figure it out.

Doubt this fuck tard even owns crypto.  His very short time on this account has been mostly nay saying on @_date: 2017-12-15 01:57:28
Ever since I signed up for coinbase / gemeni I am CONSTANTLY getting text message spam from companies trying to sell me drugs. 
Prior to signing up i maybe got one of those texts once every 6 months?  Now I get them twice a day.

Was that for a cc/debit? Or a bank widthdrawls?
Still can't figure out why mine is only $50 a week.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:02:07
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:53:10
New accounts have a $50 limit per week.  Or at least mine does.  Any way around this you know of ? I'm fully verified. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:11:43
Instead of writing a paragraph condemning me you could have rephrased my snide comment directing OP to the coinbase FAQ.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:24:01
Why do you think it's going to crash to 5k?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:49:39
Thinking about using a card. Coinbase won't let me take out very much from my bank account because it's a new account. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:37:43
I have done that. It says I need to spend "$xxx" to increase limit. It's a large number. Like $860.00 (not actual)

Some complicated info or user experience can be clarified by another user but this is bitcoin 101... less than that even. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:56:08
Hey isn't the point of bitcoin to store stuff off the grid in the event of government collapse? Might as well keep it fool proof safe just in case!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:47
Ah. Good for you. You get nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:08:59
Cool thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:06
I don't know exactly but I know there will eventually be a finite amount.
I'm very green but seriously considering a purchase. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:06
I understood some of the words at least. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:08:44
Also looking into fire proof boxes.  Any you can recommend ?  Don't need a big one.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:00
What is the MAL acronym?
