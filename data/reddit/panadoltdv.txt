yeah, I actually try and engage with the argument. I was calling you out specifically on your argument

**Were** on a subreddit about bitcoin on the internet, not your ivy league debate school. You knew exactly what he was saying and you added nothing to the conversation. 
*"how else to call someone out for BS"*
Isn't it obvious? How about actually engaging with his argument and coming up with a counter? Instead you just spout white noise

Lol it's not about to little or too much man, its about actually making an effort to understand, rather than just dismissing them as dumb or in my case, just a troll. But Jesus man, look at what you just wrote, that's pedantic. You overreacted, insulted a guy and sounded like a dick. But yeap, i'm a troll and hypocritical because I called you out on it.
Re-read what you said then what I said. It's not a catch-22, you just can't see it I guess
Haha I work in mental health dude, thank you for explaining my job to me. Have you done anything recently other than correct peoples speech (as usual) to help out?
Where are you going?! You obviously love getting the last word

What, suddenly you want government regulation?
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:13:13
sure, asking for citations about grammar is an extremely not pedantic  thing to do

No, I'm accusing you of having nothing to add, unoriginal joke included. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:15:20
Uhh yeah, it's single note because you have not said anything off substance. You grasp it but seem to not realise how useless you are. Instead it's just all "oh yeah! Takes one to know one!"
Get this, you are one of the worst, because you said the words "then" and "than" to correct someones grammer on the *internet*. 
And you couldn't let it go, you went after it, "cite sources!" "study linguistics!" "you are wrong!". 
Yeah nah, "just a joke about word misuse".
Bringing it up in any conversation, unless in the context of sticking to a style guide in a professional or academic setting, on the internet or otherwise, makes you look pretty pathetic. You just enjoy being right no matter how little you have to add.

**your** a internet genious, im convinced in you after u owned that guy on grammer rather than having a argument
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:50:43
This is like the 3rd time you've just repeated what happened, and still all you care about are technicalities.This isn't the oxford school of semantics, you don't get a prize for being right. It's about the fact that you are a twat for attacking someone with a non-sequitur and then getting super aggressive even though he posted a fairly reasonable response.
He raised some decent points like, language changes due to use, dictionaries are descriptive rather than prescriptive, English is confusing due to its traditions. And yes, there are cons to a "world language" but I doubt anyone really believes there will be one language that dominates all like its the parasite virus from Metal Gear Solid. 
And there's my point, your ignoring the social aspect of language by failing to realize that we are on the internet. Frankly while he was wrong I can see where he was getting at. There can be a good argument to be made that the internet will simplify alot of English as it has become one of the most important methods of communication and has a quick and casual nature. In critical theory there is a concept known as the Medium is the Message which I find applies here.
Re-read it, he does get things wrong but it is still a pretty nuanced opinion on language that you just missed in your rush to make personal attacks against him. Nothing he said warranted that much aggression and maybe if you read and thought about what he said you might have been able to have a discussion on language.
But I guess you already know *alllll* about linguistics, as evident by how you like to name drop things like *the blending of regardless and irregardless* and *the debate over the oxford comma*. Interesting topics im sure, and they do not make you sound autistic at *alllll*.
Hahaha *"i'm technically not the very worst person"*, you just can't help being pedantic can you? Yeah nah, your defiantly the worst ya dickhead
