Unable to get it out. It’s stored alright!
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:41:26
That’s nice and big. Scores of uses.
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:22:34
That’s a problem I welcome ��

I had a pi 3 lying around. Pi zero would be a good call if building from scratch. You need the pins headers on / soldered to use the Pimori

Brexit, what a joke. Rich people playing their seedy games.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:43:17
Thank you, super glad the community like it. ��
@_date: 2019-09-03 11:21:48
They are the manufacturer the device is called the inkyphat
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:52:00
Love tendies.
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:26:12
If and when that happens, I won’t give a damn. Il be on a beach somewhere ��
@_date: 2019-09-03 11:22:34
Nah. Takes a few seconds [video](
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:21:01
Good point. Such a great little piece of kit
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:58:56
Oh yeah. I’m sure you’ll find what your looking for with a bit of googling. Some super guides on sites dedicated to raspberry pi’s

@_date: 2019-09-03 09:24:13
I dig it too. Thanks ��
@_date: 2019-09-03 11:20:05
Thank you ����
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:25:54
Nope ��
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:58:32
It takes 2-5 seconds to refresh. So not bad at all.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:36:40
It’s a good idea. If I get time Il have a tinker. Thanks ����
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:48:12
That’s beautiful. Got a build and guide?
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:06:52
Each and everyone is entitled to their option. I respect yours. ✊
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:51:07
What’s cool is that they have a bigger one too. Might experiment with that one. I think another chap has a guide online somewhere for that one.

Great British Pound. Doesn’t have the £ in the font yet.

Thank you ��
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:41:16
You can get the pi from amazon as well is a the inkyphat. Give it a search. Or do you mean the assembled working device?
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:45:26
Thanks. It’s e-ink and takes about 2-3 seconds for the screen to flash back with the new up to date price. It refreshes every 2 minutes 24/7 
 Thanks ��
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:52:07
Thank you ��
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:01:56
That looks awesome. Maybe my next project! Running a node is on the list ��
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:08:36
That’s a problem I welcome ��
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:32:00
Coindesk at the moment
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:19:14
Had a raspberry pi lying around and the e-ink screen is £16 so not bad
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:04:48
Il reply with it once it’s uploaded.
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:18:27
And we’re off!

@_date: 2019-09-02 20:53:33
Awesome! And quite cheap. I think Il invest, super clean.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:35:49
You might be right. It’s a work in progress ��
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:19:40
Fun little things
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:50:02
The setup of the pimori is simple with their guide on the site. From there I can post the code on a git for you all.
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:47:57
That would be pretty slick. Not sure I have that kinda time on my hands at the moment to work that one out. Good idea tho
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:43:47
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:19:30
Thank you ��
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:36:25
@_date: 2019-09-02 23:08:49
Praying ��
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:25:30
It’s accurate. That was an earlier pic.
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:24:58
Cost - £50 or so
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:17:40
LCD maybe your best bet then.
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:25:33
Cool gear! I like the bigger one more. Forgot the name
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:41:26
It refreshes every 2 minutes, it works for my needs
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:18:41
Agreed. The font doesn’t have it surprisingly
@_date: 2019-09-03 11:20:24
Coindesk. Their api was quite easy for me
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:24:52
Give it a go. The LCD option is next so it’s live pricing.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:07:51
2 colours. Red and black. You can get yellow too.
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:40:32
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:48:56
Nope. It’s in its infancy. I need to do some work on it.
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:21:50
Lol. 1 frame per minute ��
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:43:08
You are correct. Not sure how that happened.
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:20:32
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:23:06
Each to their own. Thanks for the participation ��
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:16:35
Gotcha. Better late than never
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:42:01
Yeah. Mine was also lying around. Put it to good use ��
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:17:24
Convenience is key. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:39:35
This is all very promising, seeing merchants and business owners embracing the technology. There has to be that one catalyst that prompts the everyday user to embrace it. Time will tell. At the moment using a contactless chip card with visa and MasterCard will continue on due to the ease of use. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 12:41:19
Might as well use google
@_date: 2018-12-23 12:43:34
That’s not profitable. �� 
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:03:42
Don’t get me wrong it’s convenient peer to peer. Aren’t we all learning �� all the time. Life, what a wonderful thing. Anyway, I didn’t come to flame or start something. Just get some opinions.

Thanks grumpy sausage. Have a great day. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:40:59
Thank you. I must have missed it. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:54:20
Not my particular taste, albeit a strong piece. The use of excrement is especially concerning as it has a face 
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:41:51
Thanks. Pop some my way friend ❤️

Coinbase has support staff in the uk 
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:05:13
Thank you, this was the thing I was trying to say. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:16:45
I agree, it’s the easiest. But what does the purchaser get in terms of an invoice for warranty purposes and so on?
