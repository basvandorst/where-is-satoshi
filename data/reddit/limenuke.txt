The difference between 5 and 8 billion to the parties who would consider fucking with bitcoin is nothing.

Are they going to end up being mom and pop traders  / generally not knowledgeable? 
If so, I think you're as dim as you're making your parents out to be. 
If not, maybe you should just show them a couple of videos and link them to seekingalpha/bloomberg/etc.
Mostly, this is speculation - not really an investment. This isn't simply a game. Don't fk with your parents' money if you don't have a real clue of what's going on. Especially if you take all the advice on seriously...

I post in and it's the only place people will answer questions - even things that are potentially not doge. They have bots that guide you to their mining subreddits if you post a mining question but guess what - nobody will grill you for posting a mining question in dogecoin. They'll contribute regardless.
It's so friendly to everyone and that's why people love it. :D

What other exchanges can you reccomend that are relatively easy to set up? I need my BTC-&gt;USD through mining T_T

Good point. It seems had those "regular assholes" added in by default right from the start, though.

So it is ideal, but that's relatively unsafe unless you know these people in person...right? Are there mediators out there?

Guys, 400k is not a lot of money.

Sure. But people can still make money. People who are doge mining are aiming to make money. Some may believei n the currency, but nobody takes it too seriously and there's not nearly as much pride. The only people who have a case of pride on DOGE are the serious miners. The people who have pride in BTC is everyone who invested a few hundred dollars. And so, the enviornment in is much more toxic.

Ack, but I have to exchange from DOGE to BTC usually...forcing me to use cryptsy. Coinbase doesn't handle DOGE (i didn't mention this part in my original post)

Also, those who are technically inclined and want to mine, know that dogecoin is one of the most profitable scrypt currencies to mine. You can't even touch the BTC mining market with non-ASIC hardware now. But you can with LTC/other scrypt currencies.

I'm in the US with a completely verified account, with absolutely no option to instant buy.
