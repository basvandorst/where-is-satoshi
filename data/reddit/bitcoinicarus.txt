Thanks but I don't think I'm worthy of such a large tip yet :)

Thus, there was no 2FA protecting his wallet.

The 2FA prevents blockchain.info from handing over the encrypted wallet.
If you get access to someone's encrypted wallet, and their password is weak enough, then you can bruteforce the password and gain access to their funds. 2FA prevents you from being able to even try this.
In the case of the OP, it was his gmail that didn't have 2FA, and he had a wallet backup in his gmail.

I just googled BIP0038 and if I found no link on the first page of the search that would help me understand what a paper wallet is, or how to make/use a BIP 38 wallet if I were a newbie.

Sure they do. They just don't *only* use bruteforce. Bruteforce is often the easiest way when the password is weak.

Are you assuming routers are compromised at the hardware level? I find that unlikely.
For software, just use open source router software like DDWRT, Tomato, etc...


Do you have any evidence of https being compromised?
"cookies are compromised" doesn't really make any sense and makes me think that you don't know what you are talking about. Cookies are essentially just text files.
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:46:08
Yes, in the software, not the hardware. Replace the software with DDWRT, Tomato, or any of the other dozen or so 3rd party softwares available.

He messed up other even more basic stuff, like:
- dont send fake IDs to yourself
- don't stick around after the DHS knocks on your door
- don't write about the Silk Road on your LinkedIn profile
- don't administrate the Silk Road from a coffee shop around the corner from your house every day
