IMO the IMF's 'advice' has nothing to do with the value of RMI having their own cryptocurrency and everything to do with the stranglehold the US has over the RMI in all aspects of their existence.  It is implicit in the nature of the advice, which did not identify what the problems would be of having a sovereign currency, but of the problems that would come about through the US removing support and financial aid.
It is true that the RMI relies on the US for a great many things, most of which should be guaranteed under the compact.  But the US continues to screw them on this, providing the bare minimum to appease oversight committees, the UN, etc.
The RMI is worth a lot to the US strategically and what the Sovereignty Act does is threaten to loosen that stranglehold as well as impact the global dominance of the US Dollar.
It is for this reason I see the cryptocurrency aspect as a red herring and I believe the IMF would equally have warned against RMI proposing their own fiat currency.
The overall problem with having their own currency, whatever the form, is backing.  The RMI have virtually nothing to back a sovereign currency which makes it practically worthless (hence the Venezualan Petro failure).  That said, crypto is understandable as the costs involved are minor compared to minting and curating physical notes and coins and would not be so easily sanctioned against (should it come to that).
Given the relative success of Bitcoin, it is also understandable that many see this as an easy route.  Of course it is not.  Bitcoin survives on its reputation as the original crypto, whilst other cryptos, with real purpose / function and/or backing, still struggle to survive.
And as for why not adopt Bitcoin.  Well, they couldn't.  Their currency needs to be controlled and have encrypted features linking it to an RMI issued ID in order to maintain the RMI sovereignty required under their new law.
