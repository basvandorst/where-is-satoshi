ETFs will definitely help bring in institutional investors along with a large number of average investors. However, we're still in the early adopter phase, and an ETF won't change that overnight. We're several years out before we can effectively counter whales through market diffusion alone.

Another great article. The Bitfinex shenanigans are not good for the long-term health of the community. People should seriously consider moving funds off the exchange and somewhere more reliable.

Wash trading with the kind of capital that Bitfinex has access to is way bigger than bot manipulation.

The why is easy: to make more money. Manipulating the price of a crypto allows whales to accumulate more of a token at an artificially low price, or sell for profit at an artificially high price. For example, a whale could place a massive buy order, use an alternate account to sell into that entire buy order (known as a wash sale), and then wait for the price to explode (thanks to the artificial price movement and ensuing FOMO) before selling for huge gains.
Coming up with suspects is much more difficult. It's probably more profitable to ask "what do we do about it?"

You don't think more BTC are leaving circulation than are entering circulation? The amount of BTC permanently lost due to reformatted hard drives, lost private keys, mistyped sending addresses, Satoshi never spending his stash, etc. has to be pretty staggering.
