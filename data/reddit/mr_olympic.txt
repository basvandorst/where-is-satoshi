What's so special about the H4?

Is it likely that the price of BTC will drop, as it did after the 2011 spike? Or is it more likely to only grow, and therefore I should jump in ASAP?
I realize that there's no way to know for sure, but I am very interested in being a part of bitcoin and its future, I'm just worried its not economical to get involved now.

Cool, thanks for clearing that up for me.

You could try finding a local face-to-face seller, and trade physical cash for a private key. This is of course somewhat risky, and they will probably be selling higher than mtgox due to the "convenience" they're giving you.

I assume you're talking about online poker? If you're sitting around the same table, what's the benefit of using bitcoins instead of paper money?

[Localbitcoins, in Germany :)](

That was my thought as well...

Yea, normally about $400usd.

I like it, I'm on my phone at the moment but ill be looking into it in greater detail when I get home. Nice work.

Looks like we found our culprit! ;)

I assume that you've already invested, at least somewhat. If you were starting from zero, would you start this week?

I've got a couple fractions of a bitcoin from some of the free websites, and it has been a lot of fun so far. I'd like to put in around $100usd, and just see how it goes. Whats holding me back is the uncertainty that maybe its going to plummet, and my money can be better spent in a week. So I'm stuck checking the price hourly and wondering about if its the right time...

How could they tell when a transfer was made to a non approved address?

So in order to help with the security/stability of the system, a person would need to actually mine?
@_date: 2013-04-30 05:27:57
Yea, I'm certainly not quitting my job to fill out captchas all day. I've done it mostly to test out the wallet system and get used to the process

Thanks for your input man, it's nice to hear from somebody who's excited about the potential. As a bitcoin newbie there's a lot of discouraging information out there. I'm probably going to continue watching for a little while, but I'm feeling more confident after seeing the responses here.

Also $23 for .1 BTC is a bad deal, even with the benefit of using a credit card.

Maybe I don't fully understand how it works, but doesn't downloading the client and synchronizing help verify everyone else's blocks? So actively mining discovers blocks, but you can help the system just by downloading the blockchain?

Google bitinstant, it'll allow you to deposit cash from 7-11 or banks etc. It's one of the easiest ways (that I've heard of, no experience) to deposit cash from the US.

Wat.
