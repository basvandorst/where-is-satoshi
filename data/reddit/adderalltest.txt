could get there. just saying an investment based on getting rich quick, will fail when people stop getting rich quick. its not if its when

ya im on r/bitcoin the place to discuss bitcoin. no one here wants to here it because everyone knows how much risk there is of it failing and no one wants to deal with it.

Maybe ur right, but it's not gonna be bitcoin.

ya i do think the price will go up. but exactly what u said, eventually there isn't gonna be a greater fool to sell to

ya i do think there's a chance cryptocurrencies are gonna be the next thing, but it aint gonna be bitcoing

not really a paradox because it will still be used as a medium of exchange especially in illegal markets. I said any investors tryna get rich quick is gonna sell.

did i say i was an expert? It seems people here don't like hearing any doubts about bitcoin.

the last person to buy won't make any money cause they'll have no one to sell it to. I'm confused by what you are saying.

Well I said I would guess these are the percentages.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:48:39
No I said I'd guess 14/20 (70%) people are using it as an investment, 5/20 are using it ilegally and 1/20 are using it legally. i based those numbers off the 20 people i know that have bitcoin.
