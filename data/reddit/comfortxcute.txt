No way. The Sautéed Garlic fork is the one that is going to cause all the trouble. They are making such a stink!

One of the trending posts on all right now is about a guy who’s brother committed suicide over BTC so people might be a little more sensitive to these types of posts.

You can lead a horse to water...

This is correct. It works exactly like the stock market. The computer will just keep trying to fill the order as best it can. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:47:20
That’s the attitude. Never bet with more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:07:18
Futures is not for everyone. It’s really complex and not easy to get into. I would not recommend going that route.

Even if you make up your mind right now, you are missing out. Money takes a while to transfer to the exchanges. You could be looking at days, and those are banking days. 
Otherwise you have to use credit cards but unless you have the cash to pay it off 100% do not put gambling on credit cards.

It’s set by the price at which people are willing to buy and sell at that moment. Works just like stocks in they regard. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:28:47
But it doesn’t work because of how slow the transactions are. You could be waiting for hours. And that won’t work in this scenario. 
But feel free to try it. It will be an expensive lesson. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:52:21
Please let us know how this goes. 
Right this second with 200k unconfirmed transactions I don’t see how this would work. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:29:09
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:38:32
I hope so too. I’m more afraid we will see a dip because all the Wall St folks short BTC and force a dip. 
I’m fascinated by the two futures products. I’m hoping more info will trickle out so we can see the mechanics of how they price. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:44:22
It’s a ton of work and it doesn’t work due to how slow the transactions are. 
But it’s up to you. It will be an expensive lesson.

Welcome to capital gains taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:48:44
I’m worried about the influx of newbies.  I’m afraid people are underestimating how big of a deal it is that Wall St is going to start betting on Bitcoin. This is game changer never before seen shit. Be ready. Make a plan. Stick to it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:53:12
Start at Coinbase. Same login. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:37:41
You bought at 18k. Day trading is not for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:09:01
The hours. This is hilarious. They are going to set hours when trading is allowed and set price limits on how much BTC can fluctuate. 
These guys don’t get it. How will this survive when BTC is traded 24x7. 
What am I missing here? Can this really work?
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:47:36
It’s lost forever.

Smartphones (old models) dominate in many of the countries were land line infrastructure is shit. Cell phone towers cost way less than laying hard line cable.

When China bans, buy more. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:48:29
The transactions are too slow to make this work right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:09:05
So true.  Investors are really paying attention to this and having many conversations about future strategies. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:01:35
Buy more. HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:36:30
U.S.A.: yes.

Mine took 8 banking days. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:01:22
I believe in the theory of the tech. I’m unsure if the exchanges can handle the volume and if the fees and transaction times will cripple the network. That’s my red flag. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:29:57
I assumed this. I’m very interested in how they price the contracts. I’d love to get a hold of that info.  Any leads?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:36:57
Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:36:12
Limit orders. They still go through. Only way to catch the flash crashes. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:43:27
This is super complicated to do on the tax side. Stay away. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:03:18
Mine took 8 banking days. It’s drama. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:54:53
Volume is crazy right now. Network is slow. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:03:03
There are some big whales. If I owned a significant amount of BitCoin I’d be jumping at futures too. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:05:04
You’d pretend you won a huge lottery jackpot and take all of the above steps.

As a HODLer, I want it to go up. But as an investor I know that this is literally a crap shoot. Maybe we will roll a 7 first roll, but it’s a gamble at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:39:31
Each exchange creates its own mini market with different buyers and sellers. Because each exchange is unique and not centralized, prices will always be different. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:14:59
Diversification is always good!
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:27:17
Things are slow. They have different buyers and sellers.  The market isn’t centralized so each exchange “sets” its prices by what sellers are willing to sell at and buyers willing to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:42:06
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:46:09
These guys are right. You need serious money to do this. 
Many people who are playing in this space are also accredited investors and get invited by brokers to join in.

$10,000 is happening today. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:33:37
It’s insane. The stock market is insane. The US is insane. 
Might as well profit from the madness. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:15:22
They will not be combined. The ones you hold in Coinbase remain there as do the ones in GDAX. 
It’s free and easy to transfer coins between the two. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:42:28
You pay even more. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:30:34
No way. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:31:58
Yes. If you can. 
If you can’t afford Bitcoin (and you want to buy full coins), stick with the ones sold on Coinbase.  Lots of people are going to google Bitcoin, think it’s too much, then maybe throw a couple hundred at ETH and LTC.
I think LTC will benefit most from the media OMG Bitcoin is 10k because most people can’t buy that. They can buy 1 LTC for under $100 and will see that as an easier intro into crypto.
