This could trigger a big bull run in the six months or so before May 2020 - so starting say November this year it starts going big as people price in the halvening - would not be surprised to see 50K, maybe 100K by the time we get to May 2020.  After that point we probably plateau a bit.

What is "Lindy Effect"? Reference to Charles Lindbergh? IE, his flight across the Atlantic helped consumers adopt commercial air travel? So need a similar high-profile event to get people to adopt cryptocurrency?

I hope to HODL, let BTC go up, and eventually sell my winnings and buy muni bonds with it (which generate tax-free interest) in order to set up a retirement safety net. I guess it depends how much one thinks BTC will go up in what time frame to tell one how much one needs. I think 500,000 USD put into muni bonds is a good floor to have - even 4% of that is 20,000 tax free interest money per year, which admittedly is not lap of luxury but, combine it with social security, and you are looking at half-way stable retirement at that point. I mean, the sky is limit, but think about floor you need first. Using 500,000 as the example, then even having just 1 BTC might eventually get there, if it becomes a new gold standard. Lots of moving parts of course - but basically think what you need first for financial stability, then you can always worry about "wants" later on.
