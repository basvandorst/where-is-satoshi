No, I use Electrum's default remote servers. But you could set one up locally and use that.

1) Nothing :P I just don't have a NFC capable device, so coding the NFC driver would be pointless because I can't test it.
2) The customers device would receive payment data (amount, address), create and sign a matching transaction, send the transaction back to the terminal and the terminal then broadcasts it to the network.

The only thing you are sending to the servers are single public keys, whereas mytrezor.com theoretically has access to the master public key.

Other than the docs [here]( I haven't seen any, and this one isn't very good.
Actually Obelisk can also communicate with JSON encoded messages over TCP, so ZeroMQ isn't always used. I've figured out the JSON commands/syntax mainly by looking at Electrum's traffic. Because it's JSON, that is very easy, won't work with ZeroMQ though.
EDIT: Electrum doesn't use Obelisk, they use a custom protocol, got that one messed up...

Powering it via USB sounds great, since is has a USB port already built in. I used a type B plug, but this can be changed in following designs. Since the USB port is required to update the firmware, it could also be used as an alternate power supply.
I haven't done precise measurements, so I can't tell if the 500mA provided by regular USB hosts are enough to power the device.

I've done verification of firmware (~200kB) using ECDSA on a microprocessor much slower than the one used in the Trezor.
When signing large amounts of data (such as firmware), you don't sign the data itself, but only a hash of the data. That is because the signing/verifying algorithms are slow, but hash functions can be very fast.
@_date: 2014-01-16 01:13:40
To be honest: no. I focused on getting a proof of the concept running, that is also why I haven't released the sources yet, just because it is a mess right now and I want to give it a structure to be at least a proper alpha release.

They have a custom webwallet, you have to install a plugin to enable the browser to communicate with the Trezor. Doesn't work in Chrome though, but they are working on a better solution.
I use my Trezor with Electrum, because I don't like a browser plugin between the Trezor and my coins. Works flawlessly so far.

15 minutes is the time you have to wait for the transaction to be included in a block. It then is "confirmed" by the network.
However, as long as most of the network nodes aren't malicious, it is safe to accept small transactions with zero confirmations, because good nodes won't relay a transaction that tries to perform a double spend.
As the risk of a successful double spend is very low, it is deemed secure to accept smaller transactions immediately and only wait for confirmations for large transactions.
Coinbase accept zero confirmation transaction for a long time now and they never suffered from a double spend. I remember them stating that on this subreddit, but unfortunately can't find the link right now.

Yes, accepting transactions with zero confirmations is a risk, that's why it is only recommended to do with small transactions. But I agree, if bitcoin becomes more popular, that is a problem that has to be dealt with with force.

The terminal only stores public keys. Right now they are hardcoded into the program, but in the future the terminal will act like a BIP32 wallet and generate a new address for every transaction.
Detecting incoming transactions is basically real time. That's what is shown in the video. When the POS software's screen clears, the bitcoins have already arrived and the terminal told the software about that via the OPI interface.
OPI is very common in europe, but I don't know about other countries. But as long as protocols are TCP/IP based, then can be added to the terminal.

2: the idea behind a brain wallet is that you only have to remember the passphrase. Hashing the passphrase gives you your private/public key. So you don't have to remember the private/public keys as long as you remember the passphrase.
The downside is that you need a strong passphrase. There have been attacks where the attacker was hashing random strings of words and gained access to some bitcoins.

Ok, didn't know that. When I took a look at their site a while back it was still possible to trade completely independent from the site, so just cash in exchange for Bitcoins directly to a wallet you choose.

I agree. My first programming experience was with small microcontrollers before arduino was around, so learning C was the only option.
For me C is to programming languages what latin is to "real" languages. It is hard to learn, but if you managed it, it is a great entry point to other languages.
@_date: 2014-05-26 22:06:53
Well, yes, you are correct. But the whole idea behind a brainwallet is that you don't have to remember a string of 64 hexadecimal characters, because you simply can't, at least not reliably for a longer time.
Instead you remember something like "correct horse battery staple". It has to be easy to remember, but hard to guess, so the above example would not be a secure passphrase. When you then take the sha256 hash of that string, you always end up with a 256 bit number, which is a valid private key. The string can be of any number of characters, the hash will always be 256 bit long.
So the chain of derivation is PASSPHRASE-&gt;PRIVATE_KEY-&gt;PUBLIC_KEY. Both PRIVATE_KEY and PUBLIC_KEY are hard to remember, but PASSPHRASE could be the lyrics of your favorite song backwards or something else. You just pass that through to the hashing function and get your private key.
(Never use passphrases that could be guessed by a computer with access to enormous word lists.)

I looked around a bit, but I found no 3d printing company with a better price. The problem for me is that they do their prices by the volume of the object. So cases in general are expensive, because they have a lot of hollow space inside. Because I have to separate the base of the case from the top (to prevent them from sticking together), that increases the volume even more.
@_date: 2014-05-23 05:27:35
It already is a private key. All 256 bit numbers below the value mentioned above are valid private keys. Some wallets, eg armory, can import them straight away.

Modern microprocessors have settings to protect the flashed code from being read/written via the standard programming interface.
You can restrict access to read only or disable the interface completely. The only way to update the code is from within the code that is already loaded into the Trezor.
If you're interested in Code Protection on the STM32F205RE (the controller Trezor uses), take a look at [this PDF]( especially chapter 2.6.
While this practice can make sense, I don't think it is necessary for the Trezor if everything is implemented correctly. AFAIK the bootloader checks the signature of the firmware and on success boots it. There shouldn't be anything strange to hide...
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:06:08
Fees may reduce the risk, but one could try double spending by sending another transaction with a higher fee to make it more likely accepted by miners.
I've thought about this countermeasure:
When the terminal receives the payment, it keeps looking for transactions that were send from that address. If a double spend transaction is broadcasted, it sends out a warning.
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:35:57
[This]( is my project.

@_date: 2014-01-16 01:45:38
People who use zero confirmation transaction basically rely on the bitcoin network to recognize double spend transactions and prevent them from being broadcasted.
So if the terminal waits some additional seconds after it received the first valid transaction, the probability of being ripped off by a double spender is pretty low, just because the eventually transmitted second (invalid) transaction doesn't make it into the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:29:09
Yeah, I am working on a project with an LPC2387 (512kb flash, 64kb RAM) and I use trezor's crypto library. I am sure you would have to strip it to an extend where it would be pretty much useless, if it is possible at all.

For now it is a hobbyist project. But if there is feedback and demand, I may look into the possibility of making this available for others.

@_date: 2014-01-16 01:09:25
Yes, BIP32 is the key. I would never support storing private keys on the device, because one could just grab the terminal, run away and loot your bitcoins.
With BIP32, you can keep the private keys on a save offline machine, while generating the matching public keys on the terminal every time a new transaction is requested. It also adds a layer of anonymity, because you can't link the incoming transactions to just one receiving address.

The bootloader checks the firmware for a valid signature, so any flaw in the bootloader could have severe consequences, for example execution of malicious firmware.
If everything is done right, there qould be no reason not to publish the code, assuming they don't use some proprietary way to verify the firmware. So my guess is they want to reduce the attack surface.
