In a perfect world both subs would try to be as objective as possible and try to win folks over their side by stating facts. I mean I’d rather show people why my shitcoin is better than their shitcoin instead of telling them their supporters or developers are ugly. It just doesn’t promote proper dialogue.
Then I realize Im at reddit. Both bitcoin subs would’ve reacted that way.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:31:45
Hacked? Sources please or you’re just full of shit.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:06:55
legit question, why do people think high transaction volume in the bitcoin network is spam? doesn't it just show that people still use it despite the intolerable fees?
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:55:57
This. Every time something bitcoin cash related is mentioned majority of the folks throw shit at Roger. I’m not a fan but if you guys want to win the arguments be objective at least!

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:34:45
It doesnt matter if you are rich or not. The fees are high and thats the problem. How is the network under attack? Are you telling me these are all “spam” transactions again? That’s getting ols already.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:59
Im from 2013 too but didnt experience this obscene amount of fee. I held BTC through ups and downs but man saying this is always how it was is just wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:51:24
I believe some exchanges allow for bitcoin shorting. Bitmex and bitfinex comes to mind.
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:35:35
This is not the bitcoin I signed up for. Old videos I watched showed bitcoin says I can purchase stuff assuming merchants accept them. Payment systems exist, fees are just outrageous that BTC is becoming a lot like gold. People buy it but don't use it.

I think it was designed to be that way it was just not maintained properly. That was what the whitepaper stated. Why veer away from the whitepaper?
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:29:44
Life indeed is simple. I can just wait for btc to be usable. Holding is not an issue for me. :)
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:38:08
If the original goal was to replace fiat why cant we use btc to buy anything we like? Why should I even change my btc to any other coin if I believe btc should have been capable of doing this a long time ago.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:01:20
Im not whining. Where did you get that? I simply stated the fact that bitcoin at its current state is unusable.
What I meant when I said "this is not what I signed up for" is that this was not how bitcoin was pegged before. It was supposed to be used for transactions regardless of how big or small that was.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:20:18
I think the 90% was integrations test? I've read that here as well.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:15:54
And both subs (and hate each other so much. They just plainly hate on each other without even thinking that what they are saying against the other also applies to them.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:24:22
Then it will explode when it mines BTC too
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:40:01
Wish everyone could be as objective as you sir.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:26:55
Thanks for explaining without having to include politics in the explanation. Nice to have a good exchange after some time. Good day sir :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:12:15
Not the person youre asking but office apps are already available both in android and ios
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:30:04
You could have sold it for 1.7k now! Missed opportunity!
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:19:59
Got it. So technically only miners can spam the network and normal uses like me can’t do it (did I get it right?)
So the fee market that was supposed to help ease our issue with clogging the mempool seem to have incentivized spammers more instead of helping us.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:38:18
correct me if I'm wrong but didn't the mempool already had issues with transactions piling up way before BCH existed?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:07:41
But wouldn’t that cost them to “spam” the network? And won’t it harm them too while doing that? I’m not trying to defend any side here, I just want to understand how do we determine a transaction as spam vs a regular transaction?
Let’s say for example I get my mining payout daily amounting to ~5mbtc. I get it daily roughly around the same time for example, will it be called a spam? Or for example I have a hardware wallet, and I transfer 1-10mbtc per bet and I transfer multiple times the whole day to nitrogensports since I dont want to leave all my coins there. Will it be considered spam?

saying “that is the public perception” is still a bit skewed dont you think? Cryptocurrency had its fair share of media coverage recently so I think there are already some folks who have done their due diligence and checked out what cryptocurrency is.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:22:40
Just pm me if you have questions. I love trying to get people into crypto even if the environment is very volatile. Glad to be of help :)

Assuming you are on coinbase and you have a verified bank account then you should have no problems.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:51:59
Coinbase is different. Genesis offers cloud mining while coinbase is a place where you can buy bitcoins
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:08:06
Genuinely curious how increased blocksize will lead to centralization. I've been following both subs but I guess I have missed this discussion. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:08:00
There a saying in the crypto community which says: “If you dont control your private keys, you dont own your coins.” Basically for coinbase and all other exchanges this is the case. Since they dont provide you the private keys for your wallet they can suddenly go dark and you lose all your coins.
In terms of fees, yes every transaction in the bitcoin network has fees. So if you will be withdrawing your coins from coinbase there is a fee.
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:12:44
Mining is good if you have solod background on how stuff works in the crypto area. However for a more “bang per buck” it would be better to buy coins instead.
For the long term I have bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and litecoin. I’m also betting on Iota, Siacoin and Stratis to become big in the next few years.
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:00:16
Glad to be of help. :)
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:18:39
Lol where have you been the past few years?
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:43:09
Why do we need to hodl though? Shouldn't we be using our BTC and increase adoption rate? Or we're now pushing for BTC as a store of value?
I mean regardless what happens to the USD price, 1BTC will always be 1 BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:23:36
Thanks for the reply kind sir!
