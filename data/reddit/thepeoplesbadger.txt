Bitcoin is similar to gold. It can be a currency and also an investment. It is finite as well, unlike fiat currency.

Which country are you in?
For most countries there will be a YouTube video on how buy xxx coin with little to no fees.
In the uk it’s easy

No that’s the reason you are told. The real reason is that the elite profit from the initial inflation.
Money is simply a measure of wealth. You can’t print more wealth. It’s all based on every increasing debt and will eventually come crashing down.
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:08:36
I don’t feel that we can move forward with this discussion.
Money is not (in my view) what you’ve said it is. It is a measure of wealth.
It is an abstraction based on the market value of the work you are doing.
@_date: 2018-03-24 09:48:55
Argument from Authority. I guess I’ll just trust an anonymous person on the internet. No need to explain where I went wrong...
Is money not a measure of wealth?
Can you print wealth?
Does inflation happen instantly, or does it trickle through the economy slowly, such that the market absorbs it and adjusts?
If so then the people who first get to spend the inflated money have more purchasing power, as they are using at current market rates (i.e not adjusted to the new supply).

1) buy a legder nano s (it’s a type of hardware wallet). Move your funds from coinbase to gdax (youtube tutorials).
Send btc to your ledger for free.
*Note. Do your research on all of these steps and only send a test amount to begin with.
Read through the posts of people losing their funds because they either transferred to the wrong address or lost their private key.
I cannot stress this enough.
2) coinbases 60 dollar price difference is because they are listing the average of the buy and sell price.
The buy price is higher and the sell price is lower.
3) use an intermediary to move money onto coinbase for free. I use revolut (youtube how to do that).
Then you can move onto gdax for free. Then do a limit order so you aren’t paying any fees whatsoever.
DON’T pay their fees unless you have to for some reason.
4) be very very careful holding tether. It could be a scam. There is a lot of info out there about the risks.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:48:09
It’s practically nothing 
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:11:46
Well gdax is coinbase’s trading platform.
And coinbase is the wallet.
They are the same company. 
If you want to buy just using a simple app and your credit card then you pay for the service.

@_date: 2018-03-30 18:50:27
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:49:52
Not really. 1 btc = 1 btc
If crypto isn’t mainstream in 30years then it’s a failed experiment.
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:15:19
Because you want to have bitcoin when the dominance is rising, then sell for alts when it starts declining.
More bang for buck
@_date: 2018-03-26 00:07:52
That’s the sad part. No one really does unless they are a programmer and can check the code.

Sell a portion of your stack, then if it keeps dropping just buy back more

Have you not heard the nsa conspiracy behind btc? That it was a government project used to create a global currency.
Public ledger of every transaction in the world....
Not that I believe that at all, but it’s much less anti government than most people realise.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:48:24
They don’t have money because their purchasing power is being eaten away by inflation.
If everything was based on % then inflation would be fine, but wages are kept the same while goods and services increase.
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:50:17
Bitcoin will be used by governments to track you. Monero and other privacy coins are the place for ancaps to be involved in.
@_date: 2018-03-25 10:40:42
Nope, there are multiple theories of economics. Keynesian economics is a justification for certain political views. Austrian economics is based in reality.
Edit: I also want add that if you don’t understand what money is then there’s no point in us moving on.
@_date: 2018-03-25 11:55:41
I’m a lot further down the rabbit hole than you think.
The reason those countries are shit holes is not because of Austrian economics.
Central banks are a cartel so obviously they will dominate the world. Look up the list of countries without central banks. Coincidence that they are always labelled as bad guys?
Actually most countries didn’t use Keynesian economics until recently. Fiat is a curse on the masses and a tool for control.
You’ve swallowed the globalist propaganda.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:58:28
Depends where you are in the world.
I’m in the [UK]( so I use this.
But basically put money into coinbase, move that to gdax. Use a limit order.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:34:46
You can trace history back on the blockchain
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:24:08
I’m willing to bet not.

What do you mean “worth less”?
Why is a fraction more useless?
1BTC is an arbitrary number.
1BTC = 100,000,000 satoshi
Do you mean in order for it to reach $1Mil you would need a lot more people buying it?
That’s roughly 100x from where we are at now.
That’s how things grow. Sharp increases at the very beginning, then diminishing returns as it progresses.
We’re still at such an early stage in adoption.
If you were to divide global GDP by 21Mil BTC you would see how high the price/BTC could be (not saying I think it will reach that point, but theoretically it’s possible)
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:23:45
Years later the loss won’t really be something I care about.
But the gain would change my life.
High risk/ high reward.
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:08:52
Well there is a small amount of BTC left to be mined so of course there’s a bit of inflation.
But with fiat there’s potentially limitless inflation. 
If BTC becomes a global currency then it will be a better store of value than fiat.
Of course we might never reach that time.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:34:25
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:56:02
Cool. That’s actually a great tip. I’m always moving between fiat. But now that you point it out, there’s no benefit to that
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:52:26
Not if you use gdax limit orders
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:11:05
I wanna have a go!

Bank fees + inflation

You can buy fractions of a Bitcoin. You don’t have to buy a whole Bitcoin.

I only put in what I can afford to loose. Loosing this money is worth the risk of it 10x-ing.
I also believe in the tech. I could jump ship then come back in on the rise. But I want to support this space.

What do you do, Eth/Btc?
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:25:40
If they know who you are then they can still imprison you. Self employed people have to comply to pay taxes. It still happens.

An error has occurred 
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:57:22
Yeah I haven’t paid any fees at all. 
And gdax covers transfers to wallets, so I’ve practically paid nothing to buy crypto and move it to my wallet.
Well worth the small hassle.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:32:20
Use gdax and it’s free
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:28:11
There are lots of ways of avoiding the fees
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:25:43
No one knows lol

The tether will be on the exchanges on peoples accounts 
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:17:13
This might [help]( 
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:35:48
Coinbase/gdax is great. No fees if you move money in the smart way
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:01:11
If they use your dollar to buy btc then they are doubling the demand.
If they print many times more tether than the dollars they receive, then they are inflating the market. When many people cash out fiat the price will collapse.
Edit: basically you have to trust them. Fuck that
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:52:32
Until you sell at 10400 and then it bounces up to 12500-13500
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:47:25
Yep, just look deeply into whichever HW you choose and be sure you’ve dummy tested so that you don’t end up like others on here who’ve lost their funds.
I personally recommend ledger nano s
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:02:06
It will cost more down the road though 
@_date: 2018-03-11 11:12:37
Surely by that time there will be a lot more people (or a lot less)
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:09:39
Problem is when you sell high then it goes up higher and never returns to what it was
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:07:50
Bcash supporter and he’s clearly biased/misrepresenting the topic.
LN is a network. Looking at 2 or 3 channels is useless.

It’s a longterm type of game.
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:05:31
Haha that’s too much for me. It would play on my mind.
I’m still too overexposed in crypto though. I’m risking *a lot* more than I normally would.
But this is the opportunity of a lifetime. 
So long as I keep working I could afford to loose it.
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:10:56
1btc = 100,000,000 satoshis. It’s kind of arbitrary. At some point we will value things in terms of satoshis not btc.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:35:45
I’m hindsight you’ll always wish you put in more
