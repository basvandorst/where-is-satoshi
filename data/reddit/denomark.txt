Thank you. 
The article title misleadingly says "could". It already has.
From the article, citing a specific case of a doctor who had undergone conventional treatments, failed, then rTMS:
"Four years after finally having a full course of rTMS treatment, Rossi by all accounts remains clean."
"Researchers also tried rTMS in people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, **posttraumatic stress disorder**, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, tinnitus, and chronic pain. Since 2009, they have been testing it against other addictions, primarily to nicotine and alcohol. More recently, prompted by the opioid epidemic, several groups including Hanlon’s have begun evaluating TMS as a tool to decrease pain among those at high risk for that addiction.
In 2008, the United States approved rTMS for attacking treatment-resistant depression, its only approved clinical use to date."
What's important, is without U.S. Federal bureaucrats giving it that "medically necessary" approval stamp, insurance doesn't pay throughout the country.
**PrTMS is a further variation on rTMS**, at a lower amplitude than what the article describes, refining rTMS to a map of the individual's brain performance, monitored initially and again throughout treatment.
On rTMS done in one campus of NIDA: "One morning this May, in a windowless room on NIDA’s Baltimore campus, Donald Baker, an unemployed 45-year-old" .. "The pulses cause the scalp muscle under the coil to contract; for about one-third of subjects, that tips into pain." He comments: "“It’s 3 minutes of pain to try to get rid of a lifetime of misery.”
PrTMS is at a lower amplitude and not painful.
