Had issues with them . Use Fidelity . I’ve deposited via ACH

What exactly are you trying to do? Just withdraw into your bank account? Withdraw and deposit?

Wouldn't it be easier to import your private keys into BCC's Electrum fork (Electron Cash) after August 1st? Or do you need to send to a new wallet before fork either way ?

I'm confused with this . Is there a tutorial ?
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:19:33
Haha

What is the average shelf life on a ledger?

Loving the dips. I'm a newbie and know it's a long term deal. Keep the panic alive!

ACH transfers/Bank deposits with take on average 5-7 business days.
LBC is a legitimate place. Coins are put into escrow an immediately released when your payment is confirmed. Of course, you'll be paying a premium.

I'm an American with CEX, Kraken, Bittrex, Yunbi, Huobi and Korbit.

Read that as well.

The rates seem decent. 
.75% exchange fee 
.0007 withdrawal fee

Nah. I'm a newb. Buying on the dips and will HODL. It's a long term game. Let others panic and take advantage of it.

Deposits were always canceled through ABRA.  Sucks because it seems great for those 'on the go' purchases
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:44:51
Xcoins? You'll pay a premium though

Glidera if you have a bank account. Wait for the next dip, then buy. Repeat cycle.

I was torn between BreadWallet and Mycelium. Decided to go with Mycelium.

Check out their subsidiary Glidera. Simple and easy to use. Cheaper as well. You may have ridiculously low limits like 100 USD a week but it's an option.

TEXTNOW is a free option for those who need a US number for SMS only. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:14:04
It depends on where you live. In the US? Which state?
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:15:26
Did you add your reference number?
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:57:02
GoAbra and Uphold come to mind. I
