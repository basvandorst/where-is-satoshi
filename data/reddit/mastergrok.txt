I already never ever carry cash. I love vending machines that take credit cards but they have actually just started charging a fee to do so. I guess I like the idea of a cashless world where I can digitally pay for everything hassle free, but I'm afraid I have to mostly agree with you. I'm trying to give bitcoin the benefit of the doubt here though.

Just so you know, you responded to the wrong person. I didn't say that quote. He won't see your response unless you respond to him.

How can people exchange for coins without a service? I understand there is a potential future where all transactions are in coins and we are all paid in coins, but until then we will have to exchange paper for coins.

Ya for all we know Bitcoin was created by someone he mentored and that is why the creator is using his name (as an honor to him). There are endless possibilities. Not all of them end with him being the real creator.

I'm opposed to the war on drugs, but I'm also not comfortable glorifying a guy who made money indiscriminately trafficking drugs. You can be against the war on drugs and still recognize that many drugs can be very harmful.

Please don't put words in my mouth.  I never said anything about him being evil.  I said I am not comfortable glorifying him.  I guess people read what they want to read.

To play devils advocate there was a time when it wasn't completely clear and the executives were intentionally withholding research that demonstrated that their products were harmful. Moreover, there was a time when they were lying about the harm in their products even though internal documents reveal that they were aware of those harms.

It depends on a lot of things including what state you are in. This is a decent summary if you are really interested. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:55:37
And? Are you honestly suggesting that we shouldn't convict people of crimes because other people get away with worse crimes?
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:24:39
Well I specifically conduct research on the harms of drugs and alcohol, so I care for lots of reasons.  Are you implying that we shouldn't be concerned about how things like drugs and alcohol affect our minds and bodies?  We should certainly avoid villainization of these things, but we should also follow the science.
On a personal level, I certainly care about my patients.  I do everything I can to help them get healthy.

If you give alcohol to a minor and he kills himself you will go to jail, although admittedly not for life.

Am I missing the sarcasm? You do know that governors and the president can do this. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:20:54
Why are you talking hypothetically? The president and our governors can already do this. They have already done this. Presidents have pardoned or given clemency to 10s of thousands of people in the last 100 years. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:13:56
It would only be corruption if the politician was pardoning a person to get money or power from that person. 
Running on a platform to pardon someone because you know that is popular position isn't corruption, that is democracy.

I don't think you'll find many people (especially on reddit) who are sympathetic with the war on drugs. I'm certainly not. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:29:01
Challenge accepted. 
Jimmy Carter said he would pardon draft evaders who had not committed violent acts in the 1976 election. Gerald Ford opposed a general pardon, but supported case by case pardons.

It depends.  When it came to nicotine, government rightly listened to scientists and ignored corporate interests.  The surgeon's general reports of the time were based on the best science at the time and ignored corporate influence.  "Government" is big and different entities are influenced by different forces.
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:49:28
Well we are talking about very different people here. One is corporate executives, the other is law enforcement.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:35:09
How is recognizing the harm of some drugs and alcohol playing the "blame game."  I'm honestly baffled.  Did you accidentally originally respond to the wrong post?
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:03:15
Ok thanks for clarifying, although I don't think you'll find many people who wouldn't like judgment for the bankers.

That isn't even close to the only goal. Moreover, the primary way to make prisons less expensive is to have less prisoners. Private prisoners actively lobby for laws that increase prisoners making them far more expensive.

Buying on a downturn only isn't risky if the long term prospect is an increase in price. So far that assumption has held true but it must continue to hold true for this strategy to continue to be profitable. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:09:17
Even the mechanics require an overall bull trend. You may think you are buying at a low when you are in fact only buying at the new high. Thus, your mechanic is entirely different contingent on the overall trend in the market. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:54:45
Except you aren't buying when it's low if the trend is that it will be even lower into perpetuity.  
You are engaging in the gamblers fallacy at its worse. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:41:30
You are completely wrong. It is not a good thing. It is a deliberate and unequivocal move by one of the economic superpowers of the world to essentially make it impossible for their people to be an active part of this currency. Unfortunately they actually have enough control over their Internet and money to follow through with this action. 
Could bitcoin still survive? Sure, but it's silly to say it is a good thing to cut out a massive part of the world economy. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:27:44
The Chinese have made their posture clear on this issue. If history is any indication, any attempt to circumvent their will on this issue will likely garner a swift lockdown of whatever means you were using to circumvent it. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:30:54
My thoughts are that they already have such a currency. It is called the yuan. Any digital currency that they made would not have the same characteristics that make bitcoin great. In other words, it would be indistinguishable from the yuan, which is already controlled heavily by them and is already available for trade in digital version. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:54:07
I responded to the goofball who took your post seriously, not you.  I thought your post was entertaining. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:34:25
It's a fun conspiracy theory but the reality is that China wants complete control of their people and their money. These actions are consistent with that reality. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:33:01
There may be individuals who do this, but the idea that nearly every bit coin investor in China would do this with the plan to all leave China is pretty silly. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:27:33
It doesn't matter what she told you. She was hoping to appeal to your greed in the hopes that you would want in on this Western Union deal. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:43:51
And what advantage would this currency have over the Yuan (that can also be traded online and be represented in digital form) for China?  Al the things we like about bitcoin are disadvantaged from a totalitarian regime's point of view. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:25:17
I would seriously advise against putting time and resources into a fruitless endeavor. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:20:11
Not I didn't think that nor did I say that.

The Chinese lock down communication in and out of the country via the Internet (and every other way) extremely well. No, a Chinese citizen cannot just open up a US bank account.

Sell offs have happened for much much less than losing the potential backing of one of the most powerful economic powers in the world.

BTC inherently has protections that take away their control. They control the production, distribution, and even price of the Yuan. They have none of that with BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:39:52
China has absolute control over the computer networks in the country. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:22:58
The scenario you described is incompatible. Bitcoin won't be a "widely used currency globally" while concurrently being rejected by China. China is a massive global economic power and they are singly responsible for a massive amount of the goods the world uses. 
I'm not saying bitcoin can't have success without China, but it sure as hell can't replace the US dollar without the cooperation of China. The US and Chinese economies are too tightly connected.

They are trying to scam you and the girl is part of the scam. She was feeling you out and probably quickly decided you wouldn't send them money and were not worth the time. I doubt you'll hear from them again. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:05:22
Ignore the answer all you want but China has no interest in bitcoin. They already have a currency they control absolutely. In order to make bitcoin attractive to them you'd have to change it so much that it would be indistinguishable from their current currency. That is my point. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:54:03
China has no interest in backing any currency they can't 100% control. In other words, there is zero reason for them to move away from their standard currency. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:48:10
I assume you are trolling. If not, please stop investing money you can't afford to lose. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:24:45
No one is claiming real money is a network. The OP is claiming bitcoin is more than real money.
