At its most basic, OpenAlias is a TXT DNS record on a FQDN (fully qualified domain name). By combining this with Digital currency related technologies we have created an aliasing standard that is intuitive and familiar for users, and can interoperate with both centralised and decentralised domain systems. Sending coins is as simple as knowing your coin.space address. Only some Bitcoin wallets support this today but all Coin.Space users can send to each right now. The format looks like johnny.appleseed.coin.space
