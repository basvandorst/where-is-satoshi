Nope. its ASICBOOST.
they will resist any solution that fixes this vulnerability.

The big money is not about whether they use ASICBOOST or not. The big money is keeping them as monopoly using this patent.
Even if they are not using it at the moment, it still threatens new companies from entering the market.
Even stalling a solution to AB as much as possible is much more profitable for them than a real fix which invalidate the patent.

As i mentioned in another comment, even if they do not use it at the moment, its still worth millions. it is a patent that prevents competition.

Asicboost is the only reason they keep fighting.

i dont think that they will take it, as you said its worth them millions, but i am ready for the deal if they do.
They shout out that they care about 100 different things in order to confuse the community..... this is a way to show: Nope, for them its ONLY about ASICBOOST. The other things they SAY that they care about.... are just time-wasting offers, since the more time passes without a solution, they profit

Oh and by the way i offered them $15,000 for them to come up with ANY REASONABLE SOLUTION. ANY! the only condition is that it blocks ASICBOOST.
I suggested to push this solution together with them. i dont even care about the solution, ONLY that it block ASICBOOST.
They didn't take it.
Update: I doubled the amount to $30,000

I am assaf_assaf and on 30/5/2017 i did offer $30,000 to block ASICBOOST.

agreed a thousand times.
This is the only reason they keep fighting and destabilizing bitcoin
