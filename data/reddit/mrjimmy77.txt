Have you ever heard of the guy that said “Bitcoin, not blockchain”. His Name is Andreas Antonopoulos.
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:31:20
Tone Vays is a sociably awkward ego maniac that is a rent seeking scam artist shilling his TA courses and his conferences. He calls everyone a scammer but is the biggest scammer in crypto social media. He calls himself a bitcoin evangelist but all he does is get angry on YouTube and claim he knows it all. He makes a living off newbies looking for answers. Just buy bitcoin and hodl. You will be fine.

Nothing bcash has done is good for the crypto community. The attempt to steal the name, the shady practices and lies. It makes the community look very immature and scammy.

Tone Vays is the worst by far. A self proclaimed bitcoin evangelist and expert in technical analysis. The guy looks like a loner that can’t get a date, and since bitcoin people think he is smart because he got it before the bull run. Don’t waste your time with this guy. He will annoy you and get you in a bad mood.

@_date: 2018-06-04 16:55:15
The only point I wanted to make was Tone has built a reputation calling everyone scammers and being rude and obnoxious to his viewers. He should be exposed the same way he tries to expose other scams. TA’s (and Tone is not a real TA) convince themselves that they have the ability to tell the future. I call bullshit on Tone (full of shit)Vays
@_date: 2019-08-30 16:24:33

@_date: 2018-06-04 15:02:34
Tone Vays was a school teacher that had a very short career in the financial field. He uses a very common numerical indicator that he has modified a tiny bit and now claims it is his now. tone will bash every crypto project as a scam but is doing the exact same thing as every other crypto project in the space.  Making a miner change and claiming to reinvent the wheel. 
Tone Vays likes to go the other way. If the masses say up, he says down. If the masses say black, he says white. And on the odd occasion that he is right... he taps his own back so hard that he risks breaking his arm. 
Tone is an anti social idiot that is trying to make a name for himself in the space. Thats all. He is socially awkward and makes me feel uncomfortable the way he talks to Lea Wald.
