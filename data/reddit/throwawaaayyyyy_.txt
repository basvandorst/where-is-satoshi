Well his point was specifically at retail, where instant processing is possible since the risk of double spending is so low.

There is no reason merchants can't utilize an instant verification system and either absorb the risk of double spending (which is extremely low for retail transactions) or pass the liability to someone else (ie: point-of-sale company, insurance). Instant systems will eventually be standard for sure.
 &gt;Digital security is WAY behind digital currency
If you don't lose your private key, your money is 100% secure. Right now we have a lot of amateur companies being trusted with private keys (ie: Mt. Gox) because there aren't many options out there. However, if Bitcoin gains adoption we'll have plenty of companies who actually know how to implement security and these kinds of leaks will fade out.


Same deal. Many amateur companies out there which is a risk we accept *for now*.


We could always have a hybrid model where, say, "BitPay Secure" acts as an arbiter for all transactions sent through it and collects a fee to provide that protection. If there is enough demand for consumer protection then people will use point-of-sale processors who offer it. Untrusted companies would have to accept payments through "BitPay Secure" or else they'd lose potential customers.

None of the things he mentioned are a problem with the Bitcoin protocol but rather the implementation. I believe that all of these issues will [resolve themselves with time](
