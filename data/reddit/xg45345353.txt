You could do it with bitcoin.. I think that buying 300k's worth of BTC via campbx/dwolla or coinbase might take a while though. Similarly selling the coin probably on bitstamp for an EUR bank transfer might take a few days - deposit/withdrawl limits as well as you don't want to move the price by buying or selling too quickly.
Your UK bank account is unlikely to be of any help in this transaction either using bitcoin or for transferring to euros as you'll just end up paying extra fees to convert to GBP and there are no major bitcoin exchanges connected to the UK banking system and UK banks generally charge around 3% for converting GBP to EUR which is a complete ripoff.
I dunno.. it might be an interesting experiment, and you might even save money on it, but there's a good chance you'd lose out too.. imo unless you want to speculate on the price of BTC appreciating along the way it's not worth it. 
You should just use something like currencyfair.com which would cost you I think around eur1000 to move $300k into euros. Maybe also check out xe.com - I think they are cheaper. Even with the currencyfair example they're effectively charging 0.3% for the entire deal - coinbase for instance will charge you 1% to buy coins.. I'm not sure about campbx but they have fees and so does bitstamp.. total fees are definitely going to be more than 0.3%, so unless you catch some btc price appreciation while you're holding the btc it's not going to work out in your favor.
