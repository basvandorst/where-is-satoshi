If bitcoin follows a similar acquisition model of gold juxtaposed against the minor percentage of the existing money supply  (45 trillion for argument's sake),  BTC could be worth $514,000 at peak saturation. Granted, this is all hypothetical.

Ask yourself why they stopped tracking M3 after the 2008 crisis? You may not enjoy the conclusion. 
There are major sectors of the economy awash in funny money, namely real estate, healthcare and higher education. Meanwhile, Main Street is ravaged by the natural contraction of deflation, but the pet industries I outlined, thrive on through fiat.

Physically remove your dollars from a financial institution and wire it to an offshore exchange. Look, there are multiple ways to skin a cat. They tried to control gambling and look where that got them.

The propaganda that the governments of the world possess the technology to effectively ban crypto. It's a bluff. A VPN or proxy system can effectively evade any country wide ban.

Even an autocratic regime like China can't ban crypto. They are at their wits end trying to prevent its adoption.

Did the shorts buy long contracts at the last minute as a hedge?

At this point, only 10 percent savings interest rates could effectively 'kill' bitcoin and other crypto currencies. But given the fragile nature of our debt backed financial system, that future is a pipedream. People will continue to risk capital in order to escape the ravages of inflation and overregulation.

But do these teletubbies retain their value as time moves forward? Everyone seems to be lashing out at bitcoin instead of focusing their righteous anger on the individuals that made 20k btc a reality. Btc is a symptom of the disease as opposed to the cause.

Bitcoin has never been a bubble. With the world awash in trillions of unbacked dollars  some speculate that the true value of gold is actually worth $50,000 per ounce. Gold is manipulated by virtual supplies that don't actually exist. I surmise that a finite circulating supply of 21 million btc would justify prices in excess of 20k and beyond. 
Once again, prices are relative to the amount of unbacked currencies that been have injected into the global financial system at a staggering pace.

Human beings are so psychologically vulnerable to government propaganda. We had sk and Russian officials reaffirm that there is no realistic countermeasures at their disposal to effectively ban  crypto. It's virtually impossible on their end. Sure the banks can shut down transactions to exchanges, but that's one avenue of hundreds.

Sounds like the equity markets. Are stockbuybacks from loose lending practices considered true economic generation?

The momentum for this disaster was generated by the nonstop FUD two weeks ago. Perception  has turned into reality.

Us banks lose $100 for every dollar that is withdrawn. So they must try to kill the infant in the cradle.

The destruction this past morning shattered confidence.

True, but this entire Avalanche of fear was created by calls to entirely ban crypto from respective governments. Then the corporate media starts to peddle these lies to the technologically ignorant.

They are attempting to stop the virus. Sk crypto market is worth double of their struggling stock market. Who loses when crypto captures a greater market share?

There are numerous unsuccessful forks of btc with similar coding, but everyone keeps returning to the original brand.

Excessive demand exceeds a finite supply and the price explodes.

Because there are only 21 million of them available in a financial pool of 220 trillion dollars.
