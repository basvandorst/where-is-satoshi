Oh, I was hoping this was a "Tipping all Bitcoiners who have crusaders in Diablo 3" kind of thing...

Maybe we should create some sort of system. 
" 1 Middle Finger /u/ changetip"
After X amount of middle fingers from various accounts, you are banned from receiving tips for X amount of days. All tips that would otherwise be received by you can be redirected to a charity or something.

I'd just as soon see him panhandling with a bitcoin address qr. I might donate to him then. I donated to the last bum with a BTC QR. (Which just gave me the idea to set up panhandlers in Chicago with BTC QR codes.)

No regrets.
