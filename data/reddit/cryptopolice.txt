Google will even display a red padlock indicating when a message cannot be secured for TLS. This usually occurs when the recipient doesn’t have TLS enabled email services, but more and more email providers are adopting TLS.
The catch? Gmail is still not truly end-to-end encrypted, where only the communicators can read the contents of the email. It only works when the encrypted email is sent to a Gmail address. It’s been three years and Google still has no updates for its end-to-end encryption tool.
Want to take your security and privacy to the next level? Look into ProtonMail. This email service not only promises end-to-end encryption and open source code, but they also operate out of Switzerland and claim all your emails are protected under Swiss privacy laws. No personal information is required, ensuring your identity remains anonymous.

But some cryptocurrency coins are already classified as property and “assets” so the future is heading that direction. 
APMEX one gold is accepting cryptocurrency for gold. That means they want you to burn your dollar for crypto and then give them CRYPTO FOR GOLD. 
What happens when cryptocurrency is backed up by gold and not the dollar note that doesn’t mean nothing. Expand your mind my friend
