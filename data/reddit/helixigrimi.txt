The process is really complicated. They have an address converter on their GitHub so you can convert the payment address into an address your wallet can send to.

Because heavy studies have shown that some patterns and indicators have statistically yielded better results than just plain guessing.

Looks like someone solved it. Could you post the solution? I always like to see how people arrived at the right answer
@_date: 2018-05-20 02:54:13
I think bitpay has something like it. I don't know about how much they would charge but I think it would be a percentage of each transaction. Alternatively you could make your own.

Localbitcoins has the been the easiest for me. Requires minimal verification and I always use the same trusted seller. Paying in cash is also a bonus.

Are you talking the people in the picture?

Has anyone solved it yet?
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:17:26
Lol can someone explain
@_date: 2018-05-15 15:54:20
I'm pretty sure it already happened. If you look at the chart there are 3 big spikes on the weekly time frame. The first was the biggest rush and the one we're in is currently the smallest at about 50% rise from the bottom of it's support. From here it'll probably consolidate for a little but who knows, maybe a bigger one will happen.

Are you asking for help on claiming the Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:14:59
Just enter it into a wallet

In a wallet

I think maybe shapeshift io? I'm not sure though
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:53:29
I'm pretty sure you can add signatures and messages to transactions so you could have a program that signs it with their name or a ticket number

Do you buy them for more money or at a discount?

A specific example please? I'm having a hard time thinking of what you mean?

Not worth it in my opinion. 300% would only be like 60$, and 1000% would get you like 200$. And that's best case scenario assuming you do well. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:56:16
The block chain just verifies that wallet A sent Bitcoin to wallet B. It doesn't matter who sent it, if it was sent intentionally or not. Whoever has control of the private keys, has control of the wallet, therefore being able to steal the coins. As far as I know the only way to protect your private key is to take appropriate measures to encrypt it or if you have a paper wallet, to keep it in a safe place. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:15:01
As of right now, where do the transaction costs go? I was under the impression that they were going to miners already
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:16:15
Yea I'd go for localbitcoins. That's what I used when I was under 18. My personal recommendation is the seller AmazonExchange. You send cash in through the mail but I've never had a problem doing it this way and my friends did it this way too.

It's a lot harder now. Bittrex and poloniex used to not require identity verification but now they do. You can still use wallets but you'll need an adult for the exchanges

Your friend invested some time before August 2016 and you invested after january 2017

Yep. Hope you profited off of it ��

I would agree with the Dusting theory. I read that the IRS is really cracking down on people so they could have gotten your address through Mycelium giving it to them maybe? Either way I wouldn't combine it with your other funds since it's only 7$ and count it as a free breakfast.

Because I only started with 50$, and I'm not at my computer 24/7. Grew my account pretty big now tho so I don't have to trade a whole lot anymore anyway. 
TA isn't meant to be right all the time either btw. On top of that it's not possible to exponentially grow your capital to the point where you be a totalitarian. You can buy and sell 3000$ in a single trade on bittrex without having a big effect on the overall market, but buying 50,000$ and selling in a single trade is not possible. If you could then yes, it's possible that someone would be a totalitarian. And all the successful TA traders don't post their charts online for people to see. You want to base your trades off what other people are going to do, and if you post your prediction online then people will act the same way you will which then renders the prediction useless. That's why Wall Street trading algorithms are so secret. From my experience, the people posting charts and predictions online are the ones trying to create pumps, which is why these charts are often posted through social media where they can influence a large amount of people to prop the price up. 
With that being said, if what you're doing for you is making you money, then keep doing it. TA works for me, and I will continue to use it.

I thought so too actually, but I was following it on USDT-LTC. We'll see if it completes after this next dip

Once it gets off the exchange, there isn't much anyone can do. To track it you would just contact the exchange and they might let you see what address they withdrew to, and then you could follow it from there. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:00:14
Localbitcoins or Craigslist probably
