Yes, however I note that paying fees does not equate to paying more.
Consider for example that many brokers, particularly those with troves of reserved tickets sell them under face value whenever the market calls for it.
I've seen this in my local market with Miami Dolphins and Marlins tickets. For every high end ticket I could sell there were ten upper levels below face value.
In a really crappy season I even sell high end tickets below face value. Imagine going to the "local venue" and paying $75 and a $5 a ticket convenience fee for seats I could have got you for $40 all in per ticket?
I won't justify the industry I work in, but believe when I say I don't spend millions of dollars on lobbying, marketing, and PR to justify my industry by law.
The biggest players in the game, Ticketmaster and StubHub DO. But I don't operate like either of them and I stand by the quality of my service and the sufficiency of their outcomes.

I got the idea two years ago when a broker in Chicago was featured as accepting bitcoin payments.
Eventually I think it'd be great to have a direct payment method on our website, but as it is our website's utter rubbish, I do my best customer service more directly.

There are very specific industry/regulatory reasons why I nor anyone can undercut the convenience fees.
That said, many people acquire tickets at prices below the face value, sometimes well below. Certain brokerages have contracts which entitle them to thousands of seats to every event at some venues.

I don't mind that term, though unlike a walker in the venue parking lot I don't leave my office.
I also have an office, and a federal tax ID, and I don't break any laws in the course of  my daily business.

This is true, we need only look at Ticketmaster for the prime example.

We've been a bit all over the place, but if you ever want to consult, I'm pretty easy to get in touch with and I don't mind helping out even if it doesn't lead to sale, after-all sometimes you [i]can[/i] find it cheaper somewhere else, but only sometimes.

You raise an interesting point, primarily whether or not a refund in the event of a cancellation would be returned in BTC or USD.
I have not thought that through, mostly because it's a rare situation.
I will consider it further, thank you.

I specifically want to buy BTC in the USA, either in cash or with a bank account. You put a lot of links that don't work for the USA.
