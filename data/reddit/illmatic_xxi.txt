Wouldn't we become really vulnerable when there is no more physical cash? I know blockchain seems like a secure source but I just believe no matter the technology there will always be a way to tamper with it. Specially when we dont even know who created it.

What are other websites that you can buy and sell crypto? Coinbase isn't working for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:14:31
I just put some money in coinbase does that mean i still have to get a wallet or is that a wallet in itself?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:09:56

So i can buy bitcoin with credit? Let's say I invested most of my cash to bitcoin but ended up needing to pay extra on bills. Would I be able to take cash out of my investment?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:44:54
What would be the downside to just investing in a piece rather than a whole bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:11:26
Cool, thanks for the info. So what is this I hear about the bitcoin bubble might pop? What exactly does that mean. Sorry for all the questions by the way
