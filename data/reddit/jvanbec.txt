Bitcoin will only fork if there is more than enough consensus. The potential minority chain will be no more than a bad altcoin. Replay attacks can only be a problem for users of the minority chain, if that chain manages to stay in existence (a small number of stubborn miners would need to find blocks until the next difficulty adjustment)

Short story: Bitcoin is not able to process enough transactions to serve as global payment method. 
There are two options: 
* Make the blocksize dynamic , so the capacity can grow with the network needs
* increase the scripting capabilities for second layer protocols, so not all transactions need to be logged on the blockchain. 
For me it's simple: We need both. Dynamic blocksize so the capacity can grow when needed, and 2nd layer protocols to limit the need. Eventually a fair and adaptable equilibrium will be reached. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 09:22:12
The thing is, people start to realize they don't get affected by a hacked exchange. As long as you don't keep coins on an exchange any hack is in fact a slight profit 
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:18:45
If Bitcoin fails to resolve the blocksize debate, he will get his right. If consensus is reached however Bitcoin will be the number one coin forever

Who knows, it's up to the developer community(ies) to come to consensus for that. I imagine 1.0 will be created when 0. has reached a stable stage. 1.0 could be a cleanup of some historical inconvenient code constructions.

If prices rise linear everybody knows the coins he buys today will be worth more tomorrow , so they can risk buying more. 
Thus the price does not rise linear anymore. Instead the price goes up in rallies and then crashes on negative sentiment or when it's heavily overbought.  It's as simple as that. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 08:55:27
I don't understand. They say lack of liquidity results in less volatility. It's just the opposite I would say no? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 23:38:03
Basically it costs those peers (=miners) a lot of electricity to join the club of transaction validators. 
A miner would be stupid to mine an invalid block, because other miners would throwaway his block and he would have burnt energy for nothing. 
The idea is that no single party has enough money to control 50% of the mining power. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 20:44:17
There's only one problem with fiat, that the supply is unlimited. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 04:05:13
Not equivalent: In the first case it needs only 50% of the miners to make everyone 'donate'. In the second case every individual can be selfish. 
Still I don't support the idea. I do however support the idea to let dormant coins expire, to get a better view on the remaining supply
@_date: 2017-02-18 08:00:21
They could also mine (almost) empty blocks bringing the network to a standstill or start a long range fork

The variance could have been easily reduced by letting each miner calculate a chain of x hashes per block of lower difficulty instead of one with big difficulty like it is now.

Miners will be miners so as long as none is in the longest chain they will include the one with the highest fee
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:25:06
There are techniques where you can transact indefinitely between parties without putting the transactions on the blockchain. 
Only when the other party is not cooperating anymore you need the blockchain to resolve the dispute. An honest party never risks to lose his funds and in fact would gain free money if the other party is dishonest. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:23:31
Yep, we're on the Internet 
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:30:28
I can't read Chinese. Just sayin
@_date: 2017-02-04 02:18:32
The network would be split, and the smallest part would not be safe against double spending the moment the two join again. Miners on the smallest chain would lose all their fees since the split
Old, lost transactions could still be picked up in new blocks so a double spend would not occur automatically. 
But keep in mind your question is only hypothetical since it only takes 1mb/10min to slip through to keep both sides in sync. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 11:47:56

That's unfortunate to hear, but does make some sense. (although how could a xor of such large strings cause delays compared to hashing?)
Is it even remotely possible, in case of a useful (and proven) application these codes could be reintroduced but e.g. with a limited inputsize?

You should not see mining as solving math problems. Compare it to rolling a dice with a lot of sides. Whoever throws the six first wins some Bitcoin. But the more people join, the more sides the dice get

@_date: 2017-03-23 03:29:36
I follow you. Also, once there's a minority fork, hardforks on the majority chain are less likely to form a third/fourth chain so in that regard, the sooner there's a fork the better 
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:03:37
The key point is, with a soft fork the old chain has no chance of survival. It's silenced by the forked majority. 
With a hardfork there's no such guarantee. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:59:44
Someone will try
@_date: 2017-03-02 05:34:11
It's a milestone. Nothing more or less. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:37:27
You should sell now or after it has stabilized. You could easily end up selling at 600 with your 1100 order. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:44:52
The difficulty adjustment factor would have to change. Just as the block reward to prevent increased inflation 
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:43:14
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:16:46
Since the market caps are not comparable that's not a base to call it an alternative fact. There probably is an inverse correlation, but other factors are driving Bitcoin right now

@_date: 2017-03-10 14:50:54
But honestly, what was the real context for this gif? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:13:39
I never use stop loss for Bitcoin. If you set it too narrow your coins get eaten by normal fluctuations. 
If you set it too large there's always the risk you'll eventually sell way below your given price.
You have to realize, once your stoploss activates, it effectively turns into a market order "sell now to the highest bidder", but at that time rou're the last in line. You get an avalanche effect until there's a level with enough support to stabalize the price.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:46:47
What you mean stated? Is the number not hard-coded? If not how will they ensure everyone upgrades at the same time? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:05:39

I think this well decrease the potential for succesfull shorting on (fake) negative news.
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:27:02
I did not know this. How is the following then handled: 
* A and b have a channel.
* A wants to send coins to B.
* A already signs the transaction, but B does not (yet). 
Since B does not cooperate anymore, A wants to close the channel. However A cannot post the previous state, since B could then sign the last transaction and reclaim all the funds in the channel. 
I admit I only know the rough principle of LN
@_date: 2017-01-15 17:56:10
Then the opposite direction: A never reveals the secret value.
Can B and the intermediaries safely abandon the transaction without the risk of losing all their channel? 
@_date: 2017-01-03 13:46:26
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:57:06

@_date: 2017-01-10 00:47:32
This does seem normal to me. Who would deny a lot of the bitcoin community are hoarders waiting to sell at higher price.
I consider this a good thing as coins get more and more dispersed.

The thing is, bitcoin can never be blocked because of its decentralized nature.
@_date: 2017-01-14 13:02:27
You already gave the answer in your own question.
These GovCoins will be controlled by governments, so the additional value compared to the current system is not that big.
Bitcoin will always be an alternative to a regulated coin and therefore keep growing. Eventually all govcoins will fail. But in the short term they could harm the growth of bitcoin yes.
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:49:03

Original idea, but since miners are greedy they won't wait for these pre constructed blocks. 
There's also a flaw. If the proxy transaction contains a transaction that's included in another block in the meantime, the miner will get more reward than the validator will be able to collect. (I may be wrong, have not read in detail) 
But also for a miner it would be quite stupid to trust an unknown validator to consistently provide legal blocks.

Wait a minute i still see one possible attack/problem:
A sends to B with intermediary C.
* A does not reveal his secret value
* C wants to close the channel with A. However C has to wait until B has closed the channel, otherwise B could still pull out the funds if A does reveal the secret later on.
* A and B collide, so B does not close the channel. B is waiting until C gets impatient and closes the channel.
Is this possible? A and B perhaps are the same person, just looking to destabilize the lightning network so they don't care their own funds are locked for a long time
(sorry for the questions, I should investigate some more but too much on my mind to get into LN)

The difference with oil or diamonds is that they degrade after usage. This makes it possible to influence the price by keeping the supply low. 
 
With Bitcoin this is less easy because sold coins obviously stay in circulation. Still there is some effect, which you can see from the block reward halvings

Exchanges are tainting coins because they are obligated to by governments. Bitcoins are not fungible, and that's it's major flaw right now.
Fungability will be a great topic in 2017. Some other coins already support this natively. Bitcoin will need to adopt this in some form to remain decentralized. 
Still I find it a strange story. Yesterday you exchanged 10000 worth of btc in a coffeeshop, today you already want to cash this out on an exchange. Why did you buy the btc then? 
Don't blame me but this seems like a laundering operation 
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:30:07
So it is indeed ;)
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:38:44
Can you think of any reason they would lock your account? 
* Did you deposit btc with a possible fraudulent background? Did you personally use coin mixers? 
* Is the origin of your eur deposits clear? Could your govt possibly suspect you from laundering black money? 
I'm not accusing you, it just would be good for the community if we eventually know the reason. 
Something else I'm thinking: Maybe a hacking attempt was detected on your account, so it would be good to lock your account. Are you sure you did not receive any email from kraken? 
@_date: 2016-11-20 12:32:55
Once we reach 1000 it will be all over the news (don't expect frontpage articles but at least every agency will mention it).
From that point it will steadily retrace 8 to 12 days as new investors/goldseekers make a decision move their money. At a certain point buying pressure will win.
This intermediate low will determine how high we will go. The steepness will determine if we're set for a bubble or just continuing the bull trend. 
Off course that's when we don't get any hacks or other major disruptions along the way. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:43:57
This. If you have btc on an exchange, put a stoploss, otherwise keep it offline. If you want to cash out do it in bits and only initiate the next part if you received the previous part in your final account.

No reasonable person could be pro. Even if it was raised only by one bitcoin the value would immediately plummet to zero and never recover. (certain) scarcity and decentralization is what gives bitcoin its value. 
But I have no fear. Even if a government would "force" this the chain would simply fork with most of the hashing power on the current chain. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:06:11

If you would be able to prosecute your counterparty, I assume the bitcoin involved is not illegal from origin and declared.
In that case a centralized exchange is always the better option to trade Bitcoin to start with.
You can sell at a higher price in real trades, but that's only because of the risk factor for scammers is priced in
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:46:32
That's the clever/rude (choose one) part. Segwit blocks are valid for Segwit opposers. So they would have to hardcode the fork at a certain block (Essentialy they would be hardcoding a new genesis block -  with the current state)

Crypto to crypto in theory it should be possible with smart contracts if two blockchains can be aware of eachother and the funds are locked for a certain time to chain reorganisations.

No matter it was a scam or not, never trade such large amount in one deal.
Start with in initial amount of 500€ put it to the bank or verify yourself the bills are real.
Once you have that initial trust, maybe you can continue dealing max 2000€ per day.
Never trust the seller, even after several successful trades. Remember that's about a month's work for a regular job.

No, so once Segwit signaling reaches say 60%, they can theoretically start ignoring non Segwit blocks and force the fork much quicker. 
As they will gain more block rewards along the way, there is also an economical incentive to act so, so I'm curious to the outcome. 
Edit: To clarify, once Segwit really kicks in, the blocks are still valid for Segwit opposers. No matter what, they will always end up on the longest chain if they use the above method

Unless you're a skilled trader you should only buy Bitcoin for long term holding. There are much more skilled traders active on Bitcoin exchanges that will squeeze anyone with a too short timeframe.

@_date: 2016-12-13 12:08:39
I wonder, do miners have a built in algorithm to monitor performance of nodes?
* Are they currently able to detect if some nodes drop certain transactions (like low fee-transactions as stated abode)
* Are they currently able to detect if a node is not relaying certain blocks (like blocks who vote for/oppose segwit)
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:26:25
No. Currently interest is lower than inflation.
So putting your money in a stable bitcoin in the future would still be better compared to putting your money in a bank right now.
Also, if you want to invest it makes no sense to "give your keys to them". You would simply transfer the money to them and get a fee for lending it.
@_date: 2016-12-23 06:57:21

@_date: 2016-12-10 00:43:08
It's important to realize the main problem in a decentralized cryptocurrency: Agreeing on the order of transactions.
Bitcoin uses proof of work to solve this. The transaction history with the most proof of work is considered valid. (considered is maybe not the good word - it's more like a mass effects automatically resulting from proof of work)
In theory the network could work with proof of work per transaction,  but practically this is impossible. I could give several arguments but I think this is the most important:
- The chain head would be in a continuous forked state, making it very difficult to decide on what transaction to continue mining.
This would lead to a scenario where the biggest mining pool gets an unfair advantage and so there's an incentive to join this pool. 
Ultimately this will become the only pool left.
We need blocks and long block times to eliminate any advantage of selfish behavior. Any protocol where selfish behavior is profitable can only lead to centralization.

Why would you want a 1000$ transaction off chain?

- Creating an address

The miner chooses what he puts in the block with a cap of 1mb. Some miners enforce minimum fees or keep the size small for faster propagation.

So far? Or until last December?

I sold at 7000 after buying at 600. Not sure how to feel right now 
@_date: 2017-04-25 05:17:00
Until it's not. But for Bitcoin, it's still cheap now
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:15:21
Hype is over. Intermediate surges are people who put in life savings thinking they bought the dip. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:32:03
Why would you find it useful?
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:55:14
If blocks come in slower, a backlog will be created so fees will raise.
The higher fees will provide enough incentive to keep finding blocks

BCash usage is so low blocks are way below 1mb. If you would have forked Bitcoin and kept the 1mb limit in place you wouldn't notice the difference with the current bcash.
Because of low usage it's easy to manipulate the price. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:24:48
And now you get a more than decent price for it. Although it might be pumped again way higher it's a good decision.
I sold immediately after the fork
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:08:15
If that were possible, bitcoin is already attackable by 50% attacks so POW consensus would be worthless
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:43:42
No, mining is done with specialized chips who or optimized for these calculations (which is also the only thing they can do)
Your phone (or computer) has a cpu which is designed to run whatever you ask for. This is orders of magnitudes slower than Bitcoin mining equipment.
I can't give you numbers but I believe I have read somewhere all personal computers in the world combined wouldn't even be able to mine a single block in your whole life 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:18:22
First of all it's not in the pools interest to "step out". They don't provide the hashing power but earn a percentage of the reward. So al long as some miners are active, they won't go offline. 
But even if they do, miners will switch to another pool if they believe they can earn money.
Can you please also comment on my other bullets? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:42:13
The point of it could be an alternative scripting language. But indeed, except for currently nonexistent sidechains, it seems to me this cannot be maintained in a decentralized way. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:20:16
Bitcoin is scarce. Fiat money is not
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:07:49
Miners have quite a big profit ratio right now. But let's assume miners are really barely making profit just before that halving:
* some miners will continue to mine no matter what, because they are badly managed
* mempool will grow, so fees will raise until high enough to make it profitable again for some miners
* price will possibly increase because inflation is reduced. This is not certain
* some miners will continue to run anticipating a price increase 
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:13:15
If you don't upgrade your client you wont accept the 2x fork. The question is if there will be enough hashrate to keep that chain in progress. Otherwise a hardfork will be needed to keep the 1mb chain running 
But honestly, I am in favor of this fork.
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:49:35
Some consider it bad because
* It is a hardfork, so there is a risk of a permanent fork
* It is a blocksize increase, so less people will be able to store the whole blockchain
* Core is not in favour of a blocksize increase
* The 2x is pushed by miners, who were not supposed to be able to control the protocol
* ...
However, I believe if successful, it would be a huge milestone because bitcoin is able to perform hardforks to improve the protocol
(But I strongly believe the blockchain should be a settlement layer so further increases are unwanted)
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:27:52
Nobody is questioning the value of a fixed supply 
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:06:13
Did you have a similar opinion when the segwit-fork happened?
Because honestly, because that was a softfork there was no choice at all! Now at least there is the possibility to split coins if you really want to
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:57:24
It will all depend on the value users give to both chains. But, with what we have seen from bch, even a less valuable chain can become more profitable to mine.
Im very curious, if there is support by exchanges, both will stay alive no matter how slow the block rate will be initially. After the initial adjustments the cheapest chain will cycle through short phases of very fast blocks and long phases of relatively slow blocks. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:17:50
Probably yes. Bitcoin can replace the complex and expensive clearance mechanism currently in place and replace it by arbitration by traders
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:37:29
But what kind of bug could cause this result? 
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:05:49
You are right. But it won't work against a fork with majority hashrate because the end of the adjustment period still has to be reached (still I did not think of this way to do it) 
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:38:48
The one with the most hashrate.
The (average) hashrate will be determined by the valuation of the users
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:48:49
Who cares about China. Also Chinese will still be able to "buy" Bitcoin by mining for it.
They can't ban burning electricity 
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:58:20
It proves (or suppusedly will prove) miners are able to agree on hardforks.
This makes Bitcoin more robust against centralized solutions like ethereum.
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:49:26
As a store of value Bitcoin has better properties as gold. So it's not impossible if it's really seen as a replacement 
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:10:13
Yes, but the lower the difficulty, the faster the hyperinflation phase will be. After the next halving this will be even faster 
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:54:43
You can't 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:50:37
I believe at a certain point in time it will become so uncertain how many Bitcoin are either stored as long as long term savings or effectively lost.
It will become very difficult to estimate the value of a certain unit.
Either old txos will need to be excluded permanently or have to become minable again.
Mine them again is the most elegant solution I think and is still not inflationary. 
But off course that's only my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:35:02
The skyrocketing fees would fill the profitability gap somewhat, so the hashrate will still be enough for an acceptable adjustment period 
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:08:55
There is not really a problem from btc perspective. The lost hashrate is already averaged out in the two week's difficulty 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:54:57
Consider this. After the 2x fork, the value from the cheapest chain will be worth at least the value of bch. There is no reason to believe it will go below that value since most of the economy is currently committed to btc. Because of that alone the value of bch will even go lower. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:33:29
I am probably one of those weirdos who does not bother spam attacks. Bitcoin has to be spam resistant.
(so indeed, small blocks are part of that) 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:43:19
Really? Off course I was referring to the blocksize without the witness data.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:40:23
It would be a hardfork so I'm fairly sure at some point in time such fork will be proposed and emerge.
I'm not saying it would have majority hashrate. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:05:21
Lost forever.
However consensus could be found to hardfork a rule where coins who have not moved for &gt; 10years are allowed to be mined again for 50btc per block

Your explanation does not match the definition of scarce. Bitcoin is scarce. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:44:46
Don't you agree it would be possible (and in my opinion quite certain) it will coexist with the main chain, like bcash exists?
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:19:16
What about me. I installed the client, left it running for days but I was too young to realize the money had actual value.
In my belief were just some virtual credits, so I lost all of them when I threw away my pc. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:34:10
If electricity cost gets higher, a higher fee will be required to make mining profitable 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:26:43
The transaction is irreversible and there is no organization that refunds theft. Sorry for your loss.
Never put more then 50euro on a phone wallet

I'm hoping to find some information on the bug later on 
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:51:42
You sure you have a decent brain? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:59:17
The individual profitability of mining is not affected by the total amount of miners for a given difficulty. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:04:00
Good news. A bit unfortunate though the initial Bitcoin are not distributed well. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:58:03
No, because after a little more than two weeks the difficulty will drop
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:21:34
We don't and they don't 
@_date: 2016-10-31 08:14:34
I see you are new to bitcoin and thinking about the security. 
Welcome and good job! 
(still a little more research before doing such claim would do no harm) 
To be safe against a double spend, you have to wait for at least one confirmation. Depending on the amount it is advised to wait up to 6 confirmations. 
Also, remember performing a (succesful) double spend is really not that easy. For low value transactions the cost/risk is not worth it. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 17:46:11
Just keep holding and you're safe right now 
@_date: 2016-10-17 21:40:03
That's not true anymore. Where I live, bakeries are asking to pay with plastic even for a single bread. Fees for low value transactions are past. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:11:14
It's nice to have such coin, but you could never accept it as a payment unfortunately because you can't trust the seller to not use the key
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:54:23
Nothing different than the past few months
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:30:44
Indeed. The protocol should always run at full capacity 
@_date: 2016-10-05 22:41:41
In Europe it's free. Also when withdrawing from another bank 
@_date: 2016-10-31 00:30:02
Up too fast = bad. I would say let's build a bigger base before we go to the moon
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:27:48
Only invest what you can afford to lose. 
In a volatile and speculative market like Bitcoin putting a stop loss is really stupid. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 06:39:30
Just let your parents sponsor you 10k, end then withdraw the bitcoin to your parents account. 
(or don't, you should hold right now) 
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:58:46
Blocks should always be full in my opinion. If there are not enough transactions miners would have to fill them with dummy transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-31 23:07:41
I can already pay with qr code with my regular bank account. Also I can pay low amounts by just moving my wallet next to the device (near field chip included in the card) 
@_date: 2016-10-29 12:31:37
@_date: 2016-10-15 09:48:07
I like the idea, and from a technical point of view this will work. However the protocol requires trust in your organization. Unless that's backed by an extremely high stake I'm not willing to give you this trust. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 06:26:58
In that case the amount you sold can't be that big relative to the amount you still have? 
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:54:45
Mathematically, true. But the fact that the supply has a fixed limit is already priced in. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 00:05:33
I feel bad for you. Luckily the amount you lost is relatively speaking low. 
I feel very sad now imagining a future where an old granny gets scammed all of her life savings not realizing what she is doing. 
I'm just saying, for the end-consumer, we will need to have some form of centralization to have at least an insurance against these scammers. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:30:34
The question still holds. What would you consider a fair btc price for a bread e.g.
@_date: 2016-10-29 06:48:19
I got in February 2015 and made little profits by buying/selling while the price was stable. 
However I set some buy limits, with the biggest part at 175€. The buys were triggered and all of the sudden I had a stash of 20btc.
Shortly after the price was at 400€, I was sitting on the exchange doubting, but afraid to sell, I thought the price could go to 600€. Still I had entered a trade for half of my btc, but cancelled at the confirmation. 
Off course later that day the price crashed. I could hit myself for being such a fool believing the price would rise further. In a moment of weakness I sold all my btc at less than 300.
I told myself to never touch that thing called bitcoin ever again, because apparently I was too afraid to hold.
Now I bought back in at 500€. So yeah while I made profits, it's not what it could have been so I feel sad. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:32:49
I've got a sell order for about 35k for 1 third of my coins. The rest I'll never sell
@_date: 2016-10-18 06:31:05
0,2 percent means 0,004 euro for my bread. 
I agree this is Europe and it's different in other part of the world, But for how long? 
@_date: 2016-10-17 18:46:00
There seems to be a problem. 
If for example I had a store, this seems like the perfect use case for papercoins.
However, only part of my cashflow is really profit. With the remaining part I have to pay my staff, suppliers, rent, electricity,... 
None of these parties will want/need to receive paper money. This means for all these bills I have to make an on chain transaction anyway. Perhaps even more since a consumer normally will need multiple bills for one purchase. 
Why then would I not demand an on chain transaction in the first place? This would even make it possible to let the consumer pay the fee or split the fee between both. 
Tldr: Paper money is only useful for consumers. This means most bills would only have a life cycle of one payment. Making them more expensive then on chain transactions 
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:16:35
Omg. 2 years 6 months is already 2020!!
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:10:42
But still, why not continue to signal bip91 and orphan non signalling blocks? The agreement is locked in so this should not be a problem 
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:40:08
Loss of decentralization 
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:21:22
Indeed. People say Bitcoin has no intrinsic value but that's so wrong. 
I would even say cryptocurrency intrinsically is already the best form of money
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:52:13
Nodes are only verifying and relaying blocks. They have no hashing power 
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:12:01
Yes. But it would be public 
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:36:15
The miner of the block is allowed to insert one transaction to the block without inputs, but the output size can be as large as the missing amount from the regular transactions. 
You could say users destroy some bitcoin, where miners create the same amount of new bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:03:18

Let them buy, make us rich. 
Then we'll start a new decentralized Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:53:35
In theory the protocol could be upgraded to add some voting bits on each transaction. This has some disadvantages 
* "spam" transactions will be created just for the purpose of voting alone
* users don't necessarily have the technical knowledge to make a correct decision.
*...

It's not my phrase. It's the motto for the bcc fork. I was just pointing out the conflicting interpretation 
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:21:57
Well in fact I mean to say they will have taken control over the blockchain politics.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:15:47
The verification cost of a transaction is computationally independent from its value, so its logical the same transaction fee has to be payed. 
This automatically kicks out small transactions. The amount of transactions per second the blockchain should be able to handle is currently under debate
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:23:05
Yes that's the primary purpose. And because of that you can also save it for later use.
But I think your point is, if nobody believes it to be useful, it would not have value. Which is true
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:53:53
I don't think the 2mb plan will be dropped. When this 2 stage rocket launch succeeds, effectively a cartel of progressive miners will have taken control over the blockchain. 
Time will tell if this is either good or bad
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:23:01
Segwit off course. It opens up possibilities for more anonymous payments 
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:18:24
80% or more is very relevant for a hardfork, as it means the 20% remaining miners would have to mine stubbornly for 10 weeks to reach the next difficulty adjustment. The moment more miners loose faith that this point will be reached, the 10 weeks get longer and longer, until the fork effectively stalls. (unless difficulty is reset with a... Hardfork) 
The reason the ETC non-fork was able to survive, is because of the quick difficulty change (which I consider bad, although I also disliked the reason for the fork and the fact that it succeeded, as a side note) 
Also, since this fork will start with a soft fork, there will be a period where stubborn miners are forced to upgrade (the fork will outpace their blocks every time again in a 'legal' way). I am confident they will be smart enough to be ready this time for the 2mb fork
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:27:31
A transaction contains inputs (the origin of your funds) and outputs (the destination of your funds). The output is always a little smaller then the inputs. Whoever mines a block can claim all these shortcomings as a fee to himself
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:03:49
Some people hoping to gain some extra speculative money by creating a minority fork. 
Nothing to do about it but nothing to worry about too
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:17:25
Because the uaf would ignore certain blocks and therefore would not necessarily follow the longest chain. 
If the uaf would gain support of the majority of miners, there would be no fork. 
But would would would, sw will already be activated by the miners by then. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:38:02
The thing is, the consensus change is not completed yet. I do expect the 2mb to be followed, but still signalling should have to continue (and as stated, since it's locked in by the majority, non signalling should be orphaned) 
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:43:27
Definitely delusional 
@_date: 2018-12-09 11:41:31
The breakeven value depends on the difficulty level.
