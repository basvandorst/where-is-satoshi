I'm in no way trying to imply that this app isn't 100% legit, but I have a general question. With Google Play Store, do they go through apps to verify they aren't sending back user data they shouldn't be?
I'm always skeptical of keeping my coins anywhere but on cold storage, but does Google protect against apps sending your information back tot he developer?

What? How did you get that from my statement? Fairly certain Newegg.com is on the up and up.


Again...what? How would bitcoin be bad for sellers?


I made the purchase a couple of months ago, but the fees weren't that bad at all.
I'm going to go out on a limb and guess you didn't understand the statement "happily paid the fee as i didnt pay anywhere near the current value for my coins." so I'll simplify it to "i bought my coins a long time ago when they were cheap." Does that clear things up a bit?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:03:37
Luckily, with crypto being what it is, im not sure if my transaction used my currency purchased 7 years ago, or my currency purchased 7 days ago...I'll assume it was the new stuff and pay the 40% tax on my $1.48 gain.

This is a heads up for people getting off coinbase, not a statement in defense of them. 
Coinbase wanted $24 to transfer my BTC last night. I transferred it to GDAX for free instantly, and then to my cold storage for $0 charge. If you have GDAX setup, don't throw away money on fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:55:59
You're correct in that with current tends, the only benefit to buying BTC to then instantly use it, is anonymity. But buying it today, to use it in a year is a sound investment.

Correct, but a large part of that is due to the explosion in crypto in the last two months. Buy BTC, HODL BTC, Use BTC later for purchases. That system has done me well so far.

Bought 3 laptops for the family for Xmas, happily paid the fee as i didnt pay anywhere near the current value for my coins. 
Very much usable.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:43:10
If you're buying bitcoin in the present, are you NOT doing it in hopes that it will go up in value and you'll be able to use it in the future? I get some people are trying to short it, but the whole HODL concept is based on holding your bitcoin until its mainstream and usable. I happen to be an early adopter, who HODL'd and was able to use it to buy what I wanted. Sure, I could have sold the equivilent amount for USD and then used the USD to purchase the items, but I bought BTC with the intention of someday using the BTC.

When did you try and do it? I made the purchase a few months ago.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:18:47


I actually think BTC will become a commodity, like gold, and we'll deal in other cryptos that have a fraction of the value (am I allowed to say LTC here?)
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:36:04


Well unless my math is incorrect here, the $24 transaction fee I paid for the 3 $1,200 laptops, is below 0.5% of the cost of the laptops (doesn't factor in tax or shipping). Going a step further than that, even if the 15% you claim was accurate, I used a little over .2 BTC, which at  the time of purchase cost me about $0.25 when I pruchased it...so yes, I think you're right, and it was a great decision.
Alternatively, would you have suggested I sell the bitcoin and pay USD for the laptops? I wonder what % of my total the fees and taxes would cost for turning the BTC into cash. If we use your system of less than 1% being labeled as 15%, then I would be paying a fortune.


How does this frustrate the merchant? Newegg doesn't even begin processing/packaging your order until the funds have been confirmed. I guess maybe they would have to preiodically check for confirmation, but they could easily just setup a monitoring system for that.

Just playing devil's advocate here, but they also never planned for this country to be this massive and bloated.
This isn't just a matter of he over looked some small law. It also doesn't really have much to do with crytpo to be honest. This is a story about someone who was illegally operating a business, making unreported profit from it, and he just happened to be doing it with crypto currency.
If we rewrote this article and changed the instances of crytpocurrency to "euros", would you still feel the same way you do?


No, they left England to escape paying taxes. It wasn't necessarily the government overreaching, it was rich perverts going "i don't want to pay you money. Oh look, there's a huge chunk of land over there, and I have the money to start a life there. Bye". Its the same reason why corporations now days have headquarters in areas with lower tax laws. This country wasn't started by the poor huddled masses looking for some sort of freedom, it was started by wealthy people giving some sembladge of hope to poor, desperate people, in order to get them to develop this land into somewhere they'd want to be.

Money or not, you can't legally conduct business of buying things on comission without reporting your earnings. People are too focused on the fact that they mentioned he used crypto in this story.

The fact that he was using cyrpto is just a side note of the story, and honestly is super misleading and pretty much FUD.

Crypto is viewed as a currency. Even if it weren't, income from selling assets needs to be reported as taxable income. 
Now for the point you're overlooking, he obtained a commission for what he was doing, meaning he was providing a financial service (without a license), not simply selling some assets.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:29:27
No, what I'm saying is they're not getting him on a technicality. It wasnt like he broke rule 4,843 section 4, sub paragraph 32. He broke a very clearly defined law that anyone who has bought, sold, or traded cyrpto is aware of.
You're making it sound like he simply traded some bitcoin to some people for some money. Change out the word bitcoin for the Euros, and would you still be arguing in favor of him? He was charged with running an unlicensed money transmitting business, because he was performing currency exchanges without a license, and without reporting his income. The failing to report the bitcoin transactions is in addition to those charges. The fact is, anyone who has bought, sold, or traded crytpo currency is aware of the reporting procedure. You acknowledge it when you create your accounts with the companies providing the services.

If you give me $100,000 EUR and I give you the equal value in USD, minus my commission, there will very much be a problem. 
If you give me $100,000 EUR and I give you the equal value in crytpo, minus my commission, there will very much be a problem.
If you give me $100,000 EUR and I give you the equal value in either USD or crytpo, there will not be a problem.
The second you profit off of the transaction, it needs to be reported. Beyond that, if you're taking a "commission" that means you're not simply trading currency, you're providing a service, so now you're a business operating without a license.

Its generally traded as a commodity, which doesn't change the fact that he's selling things, for a comission, illegally.

It has nothing to do with the profit, its running currency exchange without documenting any of it.


Its legal, if you report it. There's a reason exchanges and sites that sell currency are asking for your personal information. 


Selling and trading crypto is treated just like selling or trading fiat currencies.


Because the same organisation who inflates it, also regulates it. Im hoping this was rhetorical since this concept is a huge driving point for crypto.

Yeah, it seems like a small number of people are of the belief that crytpo will bring an end to corrupt governments, and topple the system, and give us all a fresh new start. Banks will still exist as an institution to store and borrow currency. Credit card companies will still exist as an option to buy things beyond your means. The government will continue to exist, and will tax your earnings regardless of which currency they're in.
Crypto, to me, is an oportunity to take away centralized/privatized currency, and those remove some inflation...that's about it. I don't foresee crypto changing the world as we know it, companies and organizations will simply adapt to it...much like we did with computers.

Sorry, I'm not sure what you're referencing. 
If you're talking about some number of currency an individual is allowed to exchange per day, it wouldn't apply to this case. The charges aren't that he exchanged too much currency, its that he illegally sold (he took a commission for the exchange) currency, without following the required laws and reporting proceedures.
This isn't a case of him simply saying "hey, you have $1,000 USD and you're looking to get some bitcoin, well here's the equal value in bitcoin". He commissioned a sale of bitcoin to someone, and didn't follow the proceedure of reporting the sale. There's a reason why all the exchange and purchase sites online require identification, its because all the transactions and sales have to be reported here in the US.

How am i a slave for shopping on amazon? That's like saying you're a slave for shopping at the grocery store rather than buying directly from the farms that supply products to the store. Do you buy your produce and meat direct?
Many of us live in major cities, and the ability to acquire things without having to spend hours of travel time going from store to store to get the individual items we want is far from slavery.
Are you one of those people that think crypto is going to topple governments and change the world to a better place where were free of the chains of government?

So then let them rent a 3 office suite in Ireland for next to nothing and pay a lower tax to their country?

Because people in UK settle for it?

So you want us to force other countries to change their policies?

If you could stimulate the economy and provide half as many stavle jobs as Amazon does, I'd be willing to give you a tax break too.
Rhetorical question here, but have you actually looked at what percentage of your federal taxes are spent on military funding and boarder control, or do you juat assume that because there's a large budget it for it that it must be coming from us?

So im confused you used the credit cards for vehicles, and you're making 3% anually on them, but then what did you use to pay off the initial $100k? I'm not even sure its worth asking what you're doing with the vehicles, but I'm sure your plan is solid.

So what you're telling me is that on an extremely hot day, Amazon didnt want to let their customers down by closing the doors, but knew the heat could lead to a potential issue for some employees, so they paid to have emergency medical on stand by? That sounds pretty awesome. I sometimes have to work on high voltage in a precarious position, I wish my company would have emergency medical on site as a precaution.
Thanks for helping my point.

Ive had my btc since 2012. Ive sold a few, but am doing ok. 
I just don't have discussions of what crypto is. Yes it will be a future world currency, but it wont be some earth shattering change. It will simply change the median we use to exchange value. Its been done many times throughout history.

You're actually really bad at debating. Not only did I say contracted employees (amazon allows individuals to do deliveries with personal vehicles), but if you read more than the headline (don't worry, my mother's guilty of this too), you'd see its people who work for a delivery company, not amazon.
Yes, the company has a contract, but the employees are not contractors for Amazon, they're employees of the delivery company. 
Maybe next you can link me a buzzfeed article about amazon allowing cheaply made sweatshop merchandise to be sold on their site.

Correct, but it funding comes from other sources. I could be wrong on this, but there are policies that dictate things like 'we're going to increase taxes by x%, but 30% of that x% will sepcifically go to &lt;resource&gt;'
I believe military spending accounts for over 50% of our spending, but only about 25% of our taxes go to it. This pic is a couple years old, but has a breakdown of income tax spending.

Yeah, I hear the ROI on being in debt is incredible these days.

Oh no! A warehouse in the UK isn't treating their employees right!? The company must be evil! So i guess you only shop and local non chain stores that create their own materials? 


How many people work for Amazon, amf what percentage of them work in a warehouse? Does that factor in the independent contractors doing amazon delivery? What about the Amazon Turk jobs? I honestly think its hilarious that with a company as big as Amazon is, the issue you point out is a warehouse in the UK with people who think they'd be fired for taking a bathroom break. I'm not familiar with UK labor laws, but im fairly certain they'd have a caae for wrongful termination. Or does the UK have loose labor laws?
