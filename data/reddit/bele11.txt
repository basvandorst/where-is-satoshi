@_date: 2018-01-10 12:36:27
Amazing. Good bye shitcoins, I mean bcash
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:28:18
Like apple and google
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:59:39
We never forget scammers

Fuck the coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:38:10
Scam company
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:28:34
Bcash is centralized scammers nest. You should be so stupid to store value over there
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:15:24
They are scammers
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:10:43
Sure bitcoin is a store of value. Bcash you can buy on any exchange. Usually scammers like you call this crap as bitcoin. But it's just a trash coin like all fans of btrash.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:39:59
You are reading bullshit
@_date: 2019-07-10 10:21:13
Example? What alts what particular problems solving?
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:57:08
Nope. It’s a scam. Never use bitcoin.com
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:42:31
Hodl Bitcoin only. Alts is designed to steal bitcoin from noobs. That’s what happened for you. Just buy and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:46:09
Other coins are shitcoins. Only crazy can store value there
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:16:22
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:18:16
They finely run a scam site
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:52:56
./btc subreddit is a scammers ant trolls place. Avoid it
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:05:54
Decentralization is the main satoshi vision. That's what bitcoin have and not other shitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:12:51
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:17:03
It's already happening
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:42:53
Yes, but will be soon. LN on top of decentralized chain sounds like perfect solution
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:36:21
Scam company. Avoid them in anyway
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:12:28
All are centralized. Only bitcoin is decentralized
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:42:07
Bitcoin.com is a scam. Do not use it!
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:32:40
You should be blind by not seeing test versions. Ppl are working while you are complaining
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:26:46
Charlie Lee even told that litecoin is less decentralized than bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:50:44
Run your own full node
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:38:24
Bcash and blockchain.info both same scammers. Soon both will be useless and abandoned
@_date: 2018-09-20 18:03:40
Why can’t? I bought coffee with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:19:01
When segwit?
@_date: 2018-09-17 10:47:32
What’s your second choice for the internet?
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:16:53
No I guess Siat will be king
@_date: 2018-09-29 12:03:55
RIP bcash
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:36:56
Store of value is main purpose I would say. LN is good also to wipe out shitcoins with fiat
@_date: 2018-09-19 08:11:31
Updated. Thank you, devs!
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:13:50

Bcash is the real bitmain roger that scam. Deal with it
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:49:45
The real bitcoin is bitcoin. The real scammer is Roger Ver. Need more explanation?
@_date: 2018-08-07 10:22:30
Not to mention decentralization of nodes which is crucial for bitcoin to survive 
@_date: 2018-08-06 11:28:22
You will need to edit your username, sadly. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 06:36:53

@_date: 2018-08-15 09:40:31
Sorry for your disability
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:05:37
I run full node on my $150 laptop. It’s fast and cheap. I don’t see any trouble to run bitcoin full node
@_date: 2018-08-01 05:41:29
But their CEO is anti bitcoin and do anything to damage it. I would not use this service from principle
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:49:49
Yep no single trade since 2013 just hold and it works just perfect
@_date: 2018-08-06 10:41:22
So from Bitmain cash, they will only Bitmain. Very straightforward 
@_date: 2018-08-19 21:00:47
What a desperate looser. I’m sick of this fraudster. Can’t look at his shit face
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:36:13
Roger Ver is a criminal. His place is in jail
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:02:59
Majority of hashpower didn’t want segwit. But users stayed in front of miners and said fuck you miners, you don’t decide anything with bip 148 and they just did what users said. FACT
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:43:56
Bitcoin you should bought yesterday
@_date: 2018-05-25 08:35:07
Nope. Because users say so, miners don’t have power to decide
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:16:17
Miners follow the chain where users transact. Majority of users choosed original valid chain. Miners don’t have choice. They can mine different chain even now. But they don’t. Think about that, noob
@_date: 2018-05-08 06:34:35
@_date: 2018-05-08 08:21:24

Do it
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:53:08
Amazing respond!
@_date: 2018-05-26 07:49:30
GFY scammer
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:13:23
In a decentralized world nodes updates goes not instant ( like in bcash centralized ).  Still miners have 0 power in decisions. Otherwise bitcoin would be dead long long time ago. FACT
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:22:47
No just after some time change bcash to btrash
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:43:15
They do and a lot. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:12:00
Their coin is centralized. No matter what block size is. Could be 1TB. Shitcoin is still shitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:51:08
So cash is the real cash
@_date: 2018-05-01 10:04:09
I know. Looks like not the last time
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:39:05
We can agree he is a scammer for sure
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:52:58
You are missing the whole point. Users choose what node to run with rules. Miners just mines the chain what majority of users choose. Miners didn’t have choice like to activate segwit, otherwise they would loose billions of dollars in revenue. So by saying that miners decided to activate segwit is stupid. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:08:02
How you would pay by debit card if POS goes offline?
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:03:48
I already did. You are not
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:06:01
Same as register trademark ‘internet’. Lol
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:12:58
He meant bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:31:24
What if this happen in 5 years with abolished cash?
@_date: 2018-08-05 19:32:01
Moon is coming soon 
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:09:38
There is bitcoin and plenty of shitcoins
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:22:30
Your facts delusional. Try to refute mine
@_date: 2018-05-20 12:29:34
They took investment from scam actors. So it’s done
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:04:07
Brain wallet
@_date: 2018-10-21 10:01:18
What we know for sure is bcash a dead project. What’s related to bitcoin is all very promising. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:21:04
Becouse of freedom. Bcash is a centralized scamcoin
@_date: 2018-10-29 13:12:10
Bch too risky to use. Better stay with BTC only
@_date: 2018-10-28 17:54:55
Always buying. Fundamentals still the same
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:01:50

@_date: 2018-10-30 10:55:09
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:59:34
Any way to claim bcash from blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:39:49
Slush and bitfury best pools for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:49:59
@_date: 2018-10-06 13:12:41
Why debate scammer? Jesus..
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:28:46
Btc is blockchain. If there is an option to spend coins avoiding fees for greedy enemy miners like bitmain etc then I better will use LN channels and keep bitcoin decentralized
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:35:18
Bitcoin is bitcoin. Bcash is shitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:44:24
The only patent is asicboost for bitmain. Segwit nobody owns patent. What I want to say that bcash are loosers they even can't code their own code, fully centralized and you wanna store there your value? Only fools can do this.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:34:35
It's shitcoin, dom't buy
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:01:52
You shouldn't read forbes they are hacked and writing bullshit
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:51:51
I pick cheap and decentralized with LN
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:43:26
Yes, ordinary. Like ordinary altcoin not worth to keep more then 10% in your crypto asset.
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:06:52
He is rational smart guy. Perfect
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:15:22
Congrats. You are awesome. Just ignore these trolls comments
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:14:01
Yes, it's impossible to sell almost that's why some value still have
@_date: 2018-10-05 11:12:20
When jail, Roger?
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:01:54
How's going with bcash blocks? Working perfect? Lol
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:59:26
Yes, it is. Educate yourself
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:24:07
Bye. Have a nice day with your shitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:27:59
Coinbase mean bcash?
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:32:08
LN will compete against other. So in decentralized market on the long run only low fees LN networks will win. That's the point. No this centralized bullshit like we have now
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:51:44
They are playing against their own interest. They don't see big picture only short term interest. Their greed will lead to POW change and that would be good lesson.
P.s. Not all miners, just these from China mainly. Still exist great pools like slush, bitfury
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:18:59
You are a perfect example of this
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:35:14
is a sick subreddit of paid trolls mostly from China. They talk lot's of bullshit. I don't recommend to visit it at all it's too dangerous for normal people
@_date: 2018-10-25 11:02:29
Bitcoin never forked. You can run oldest node and you are fine. Some altcoins copy/paste bitcoin core code but it’s not a fork
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:03:55
They are clowns and do not understand that community need real btc not fake trash. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:23:59
Then you understood it wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:05:53
Only markets should decide which is true bitcoin not miners especally when it's so centralized.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:45:59
Miners like bitcoin.com, antpool, viabtc is causing high fees,, they are suppose to be friends but they are the biggest enemies in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:16:09
That's why we need segwit + lightening networks
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:05:18
You mean bcash?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:57:35
Soon you will be able to make micropayments very cheap, just wait :)
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:26:13
I would definitely agree with Luke to decrease block size to have fully decentralized system. We gonna have 2, 3 layer cheap transactions, so we don't need big blocks at all.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:35:39
You are talking about future. Still need some time for this
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:56:25
Ready to sell bunch of bcash for 300. Let's make p2p deal. As I can't dump this crap on exchanges, nobody accept it.
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:42:13
They let btc withdrawals without delays?
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:57:36
Sounds good. Thank you for sharing your experience
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:09:07
So? Don't like don't use. Who cares about you dumb trolls? Use paypal if you want cetralization
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:14:08
Or maybe not
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:25:47
Bcash = bitcoin cash = shitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:44:55
It's an ordinary altcoin. We have plenty of it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:21:29
You will be more old after it confirm :)
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:43:08
I use. Great wallet
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:42:03
Smart move
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:42:53
To dump this shit coin is a pain in the ass. Hope after 20 confirmations it will have some value left
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:04:56
Yep just sent btc with segwit. Took 4mins, 100 usd cost 3 ct. Very glad
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:36:11
Waiting best time dump it
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:36:41
This is room for scammers? I hope I will never visit it again
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:38:23
Do not use  to accept bitcoin, they are fraud now.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:09:47
Bcash is an alt coin, more known as shitcoin or scam coin who runs madness people. Some strangers call it Bitcoin cash..
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:48:51
Bcash is centralized, they can increase cap to any number. Only stupid can risk by buying it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:51:31
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:24:20
Dump 2x of course
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:50:48
Don't use wallets with high fees
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:12:12
But here cheapier
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:53:23
 blocks every 6 hours. You can get old by waiting payment to be confirmed :D
Segwit payment was cleared already with small fee.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:46:41
Ok. Bye
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:42:45
Have some common sense, you are supporting criminals
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:23:09
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:29:36
So? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:39:08
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:21:22
Dumb trolls
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:48:07
Thank's god they are leaving btc alone
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:36:25
Omg, bcash is dead no more new blocks
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:16:47
 you are amazing!
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:02:00
Lol. Nobody wants this scam coin
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:10:35
Yup, only idiots support bcash. I hope he is not
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:34:30
Slush pool and bitfury are the only real miners
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:50:09
Propoganda. I wish you to have more common sense and choose what is good or bad
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:05:52
Insightful. Lol
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:21:14
Not mining empty blocks and don't jump on every penny like a bitch to an altcoin which is an attack to real bitcoin, btw bcash created by these bitches
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:40:29
Already sold. Free btc
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:32:57
BCH is not bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:52:09
We get back to the main problem miners centralization. And it will stay for a long, damn..
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:05:39
You are too stupid for this system then
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:15:08
Bcash is useless, nobody use it, don't have savvy devs, just copy other code. In other word they are criminals
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:43:08
I don't think bcash will ever succeed
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:59:58
Altcoins are scam. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:00:59
Decentralized can't without consensus. In bcash case it's centralized and well known actors, dishonest scammers. So my advice would be stay away
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:37:18
FYI, It's not 2MB hard fork but it's 8MB!
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:50:40
Well done
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:41:01
They already hard forked. So stay with your bcash alone
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:41:46
Guess who gonna survive :)
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:13:11
Just like bcash, just sell all for real btc these forked crap
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:38:00
They want smaller blocks I guess :)
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:49:02
Real Bitmain is scam too
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:20:28
Again dividends?? BTC you are amazing!
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:28:43
Nice! I'll try hitbtc as well. So without kyc if you want to withdraw more you need just just accounts with different emails?
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:00:48
Try yourself and you will see. Like I said I can sell for 300 all
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:10:57
Never use bitcoin.com, owner is the biggest scammer
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:46:08
Will be better time, just wait
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:30:42
Just a reminder, Bitpay is a fraudsters. Do not use their service
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:22:40
Always were
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:09:33
Let's hope crap trolls like you will not be funded anymore soon
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:47:52
Of course not. Block size increase would cost centralization a lot in terms of nodes. If I can't run full node cheap then it's a problem in bitcoin. We well have lot's of hubs and they will need to compete to get users. So I don't see here a centralization. It's more a FUD from big blockers.
@_date: 2018-06-23 18:04:06
I’m saying hodl and accumulate more during bear market.  It’s amazing opportunity!
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:58:12
Bitcoin is the only decentralized coin. All other coins can be easily shut down or increase cap. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:16:56
Competition will fix all high fees issues on LN. And it's much better then no competition on miners side, aka centralized miners. And one more thing, it's a soft fork, you can use it or not, it's up to you. Segwit give us freedom
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:52:52
Sure bcash
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:20:10
Real bull run will be after halving. But believe me worth to wait.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:17:14
Why sell? Only buy
@_date: 2019-08-01 14:28:23
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:14:44
It have nothing related to bitcoin. It's an altcoin bcash
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:46:23
Greed is poison and he is full of greed
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:33:47
Not possible
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:48:58
Really? By mining empty blocks? By mining bcash at lost? They are just enemies to btc
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:35:08
Bcash is not safe. They have double spend issues.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:00:06
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:49:14
You can’t shut down decentralized network, just like torrent, otherwise it would be already done.
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:14:29
Detect and inform about bcash scam to noobs
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:54:49
Dumb money is selling. Smarts are hodling and buying
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:19:36
Let's fire Garzik!
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:20:39
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:13:11
You are right, this one special, have some flavour of scam
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:58:42
It's 8mb not 2!
@_date: 2018-06-23 09:01:52
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:51:54
.info and .com same scammers. Do not use their service.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:41:50
It’s a scam. Avoid this site
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:22:33

@_date: 2019-08-03 19:43:38
Because they didn’t buy it when it was cheap

Blockchain adoption? Wtf is that? Maybe you mean bitcoin adoption?
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:05:35
Outcome would be that miners loose money so they will switch to pools who let decide what to mine. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:18:51
I use core wallet
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:35:56
Very risky game, they need to be very wealthy to play such games
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:23:30
I never use service with bitpay payment processing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:53:34
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:21:25
Whole attack shit postpone implement segwit into core. Will be soon. They do not do business. Business wallets should implement segwit asap if they wanna stay competitive
@_date: 2019-06-09 18:26:46
What I know for sure bcash is dead
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:31:33
You can’t stop Mcafee from eating his own dick
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:14:43

Interesting what they gonna do with it :)

Bitpay is a  scam company. They were behind 2x attack. Do not use them!
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:25:39
After every difficulty adjustment they need to pump price in order to compete with bitcoin to get miners. You can check more info about profitability and difficulties here: 
Once big companies like coinbase will release all bch I guess price will dump dramatically 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:54:02
Bcash future is obvious, into trash box with all the rest scamcoins

@_date: 2017-11-07 06:59:09
Yes, sell air drops for bitcoin is perfect way
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:00:42
I recommend not use services who did't implement segwit yet
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:04:01
I wonder too

Hope so
@_date: 2018-11-10 11:02:30
1sat/byte is high fees for you? Segwit with shnorr signatures will increase block size almost to 4mb and without hard fork. Hard fork is very very bad way to increase block size.
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:02:12
And should hit $100 by 2018
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:20:57
Not crypto, Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-09 15:16:32

Yes, UX could be better. But by functional greenaddress is very good wallet
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:20:14
@_date: 2018-03-07 05:42:30
Yes, breadwallet is a shit wallet. Greenaddress the way better

It’s like build a better internet. Good luck with that
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:56:27
2x is a mist. It's done
@_date: 2019-01-27 06:07:27
LN is a solution. No need for altcoins anymore
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:05:33
Wtf miners agreeing all the time? They are so stupid to realize that in decentralized system there are no agreements. If it's more profitable you mine if not you mine other coin. It's simple
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:59:00
You can use layer one if you don't like layer two, it's up to you. Everybody should have freedom to choose. I personally want to use layer 2 for cheaper transactions
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:07:56
2x will fail like all attacks. Companies who support it will loose shares to other rivals. It's ok, we'll get just better services instead. That's why bitcoin should stay decentralized - to ban/ignore attacks.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:34:14
Great trader
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:47:22
Just hold and you will not loose anything
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:07:05
You even didn't activated segwit yet which should be priority number one. You had plenty of time to do so. From my pov you are fully supporting 2x and it's shame. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 19:16:24
Cool 
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:46:39
He is criminal
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:29:12
It won't. You need more objective readings I guess, stop reading this propoganda from china bad actors
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:21:26
Uninstalled this crap
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:56:48
It's an attack to bitcoin and bad actors are well know. But this it will not workout again for them
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:18:36
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:46:11
Or maybe goverments, central banks are behind these bad actors already?
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:21:24
Where is Luke?
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:06:58
Will run only core node. No2x!
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:31:16
 actually 1/5
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:41:46
This would be awesome. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:03:50
If you truelly support bitcoin you need to anounce now that you don't support 2x and will continue with core. Otherwise you are supporting those attackers as well
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:17:32
This is just FUD. You still can use transactions on chain. I want freedom to choose. Increasing block size impossible to scale bitcoin, and big blocks lead to full centralization. Read use cases about that.
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:19:27
If Roger would show dick in front of rbtc, they would support it
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:27:21
What about public statement that you do not support 2x? You will be loved even more from users. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:59:26
Bitpay is walking dead
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:43:48
At least litecoin not attacking bitcoin like bcash and other crapcoins
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:56:35
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:16:28
Move before split
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:41:37
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:07:35
Gosh, what this scammer Roger is doing here?
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:03:04
Who cares? It will be useless just like bcash. We shouldn't be affraid of such attacks. Bitcoin too strong to be taken by scammers
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:27:41
2x was fired.
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:20:34
Good thing that miners doesn't decide anything. They can mine altcoin, other miners will come to mine bitcoin. Mining cost a lot so they need to pay bills. They can't mine in a loss for a long
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:35:04
And miners and exchangers follow money. So agreements are useless. Users will lead them where to go
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:27:09
No no bitches, you will not get my bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:01:54
S2x is just a bullshit
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:16:02
educate yourself, noob. You are talking bullshit
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:11:29
Buy 100% btc
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:38:15
Not for you to decide when. You think permanent block size increase is a solution? And centralized nodes are ok?
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:51:07
I don't care about scam actors like Roger and Jihan. Just ignore them
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:25:15
So it's a one more reason to close your account with coinbase asap
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:05:18
Did they ban facebook, google? Yes they did. Do people use these services from China? Yes they do. Do they go to jail for that? No they don't. Did they ban btc in the past? Yes they did, several times. Did they unban it many times, yes they did. Why? Because they know that ban in this case not works. So I don't care about such statements. Let's panic more, I will buy cheaper coins, it's ok
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:55:28
Thanks god that satoshi added 1mb size cap, otherwise bitcoin would be dead already
@_date: 2017-09-26 18:59:59
We already have tons of centralized cryptos. Bitcoin is the only one worth value.
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:55:01
You are stupid or paid troll
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:10:43
Move out your coins from coinbase asap. It's a trap. They are gonna scam users
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:08:24
2MB? We already have close to 4MB.  NYA want a downgrade block size? Insane FUDers
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:11:46
You are stupid if you ignore risks without blocksize cap
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:14:42
Nobody cares about bcash it's just useless shit. Same will be with x2 coin. People are not stupid. And these attackers just burning money.
@_date: 2017-09-08 07:26:06
Amazing. Japan like always amaze!
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:14:03
Yes it is
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:54:41
Will forward this to anyone I talk
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:08:31
Never visit rbtc again. This sub was created by Roger Ver to spread propaganda and lies
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:15:22
Ver is a scammer. Don't listen him
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:30:34
But it is simple. I don't care about these scammers attempts. Bitcoin is decentralized and you can't overtake it. I will dump all air dropped coins as soon as I can safely split them. You should see big picture instead of reading propaganda.
@_date: 2017-10-05 05:42:57
Nodes valuable only which making transactions. So no point to run 20k nodes over night. Ant stop listening to s2x FUD. Just ignore them
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:23:39
Sell for fiat? Are you crazy?
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:53:20
Hash power doesn't matter. They can go away, it's ok. You can't break bitcoin. Others will mine
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:03:58
Sure we need fight. Educate users, run full node and make transactions over there
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:21:53
Do not use coinbase, they support 2x. Your coins will be at risk
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:29:51
Temporary thing.
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:15:14
Thank you for being sane.
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:56:38
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:20:47
Wrong. Bitmain the biggest evil of all this mess. But not for long
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:14:45
I don't believe in China statements, we already saw this in the past. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:32:10
2x is an attack to bitcoin. You even understand that?
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:37:26
Coinbase will bankrupt in this case. And miners will mine what is profitable
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:33:45
Ppl realized that USD is a bubble
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:38:24
Just ignore this idiot
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:15:39
Would be nice start. Only bad things happens from china
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:48:40
I just ban China
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:25:13
Paper wallet, trezor, ledger nano
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:41:04
So it's dead. To survive need more then 50%
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:23:01
Just ignore FUD and hodl bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:00:31
Yep we'll see soon
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:53:26
How stupid ppl should be to support bcash? Unless you are one of creator, otherwise it's shows stupidness
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:17:18
2018 will be the year when fiat currency will be dumped
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:25:45
I just wrote buy btc on one post and got banned for 14 days. Great sub! 
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:17:22
Miners do not have votes, they just mine which is more profitable. You still don't understand how it works? Try to educate yourself
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:45:30
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:31:00
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:31:10
Just ignore him. Not worth time
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:23:54
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:20:26
Some will mine, but not more then 30% hashrate
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:41:57
I will support bitcoin. Air dropped shitcoins I'll dump instant
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:05:43
Sorry for you, man
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:42:44
Redditor for one week? Nice try Jihan, Roger or whatever scammer
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:45:54
Fuck b2x and all their actors
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:06:43
Shit coin will stay shitcoin. And only shitty miners can mone just like bcrap
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:51:22
What can I say, lol
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:23:16
It won't. You need more objective readings I guess, stop reading this propoganda from china bad actors
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:50:38
It's esier to buy gpu then asics. Asics is a pain in the ass right now and miners are very greedy along with their ego. I would change pow for that asap.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:56:15
They ban for mention bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:11:03
Bitwala and cryptopay.me are decent as well. Xapo scamming for a long time. With their statement they proved it once again
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:01:05
Adam is doing amazing work. Fakesatoshi aka craig wright the biggest butthead in bitcoin along with other trolls like ver, jihan.. and you are same troll. Price will be stable just like after btrash fork
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:13:56
It's just impossible. How you will convince all users to move value to 2x? Majority support original btc. If that would be possible all these bu, classic, bcash would already be bitcoin. But where are they? Bcash dying slowly and nobody uses it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:04:51
It's dead by markets future
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:08:17
Your post is totally crap. Go learn again
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:59:20
So? Anyone can split. Btc still stays btc
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:53:34
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:16:07
Nobody believe in this fraudster. Just ignore him. He have some mental illness
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:44:42
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:43:07
AFAIK yes
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:47:10
I support POW change if it helps for mining decentralization
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:35:31
Bitcoin com is a big scam. Do not use them
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:57:13
Have a great day with bch, lol
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:44:41
It will list, if they add replay protection. But it will be one more bcash clone, useless just like bcash. Only real bitcoin is worth value
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:39:24
Bad actors want to overtake bitcoin brand. And mining centralization is very bad. Pow change would solve that
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:37:40
2x is shit
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:56:16
I will repeat once again. Miners will follow the money. We saw this on bcash. So don't write stupid statements
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:27:50
Miners is a bitch. Will do anything for money. No2x
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:32:10
Nope. You were. Or you try to do so. Use your btrash
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:14:23
With coinbase you will loose money. Better not to use them
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:16:57
Don't use coinbase, they are bad players and your coins at risk there
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:20:42
That would be the end for coinbase. Hope this will happen
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:20:47
Coinbase is behind s2x attack. Better move out your coins and close account
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:17:40
After 2x hardfork we will see how centralized miners are. If over 80% then pow instantly!
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:08:17
Bcash is just a roger's trash
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:06:47
Nope. Thats why they still mine main net. They decide nothing
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:38:59
Hitbtc for instance
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:20:21
Nope. We do not need bigger blocks. It's not a solution. Only gives centralization that's what bad actors want. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:43:59
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:11:15
Means that you are too stupid to understand
@_date: 2017-10-06 08:41:41
Miners follow the money. They can signal anything, still they follow money. So any agreements are useless
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:35:21
Luke worth much more then this
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:09:03
Bitcoin core write code, not propaganda. The only devs who really work hard to scale bitcoin. Jihan, ver are enemies to bitcoin and if you support them then you are enemy also.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:27:07
I support only bitcoin, no to scamcoins!
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:09:28
Miners decide nothing, they just mine
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:37:25
Why they join this scam company?
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:25:35
Do not look daily. Look monthly. Much easier
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:30:45
Just move your coins from coinbase until it's not too late
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:41:44
Or central banks, goverments?
@_date: 2017-10-07 12:50:55
95%? From where these numbers? Bitfury, f2pool, slush pool are out of nya. Before split many miners will switch to normal pools to mine real bitcoin. Actually only bitmain will try to mine at a loss but it's good, they just burn more money. I see win win situation here
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:44:04
Their CEO just made a statement that they are gonna scam users. So yes, they are scammers
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:50:23
King of scammers more accurate describtion
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:52:53
He support segwit. He mentioned that many times
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:04:38
Miners follow the money
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:42:54
No to bread wallet. I thought you will handle this better

Seems you need to read it twice. Or you see different reality?
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:30:06
Bullshit talk. Go spread your propoganda somewhere else
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:55:09
They singed NYA and have plenty time to cancel it.   Garzik visiting coinbase regarding 2x nodes? Looks like coinbase behind this shitty attack. I have closed my account with coinbase after they signed NYA
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:59:47
 I only see here a death spiral
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:17:41
I don't care about forks. I care about original bitcoin only. If biz will support only forked crap then fuck that biz
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:30:48
Every noob must read it and make decisions! Good read
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:50:58
Bitcoin will ban China more likely
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:41:15
That's why bitcoin will survive not forked shits
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:02:50
Miners will follow money. So b2x is dead from start
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:41:51
Go away from bitcoin cobra. You are failed. Nobody will trust you anymore
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:35:11
Bitfury have some deal have with Bitmain, that's why they still signal
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:27:11
Coinbase is one of bad actors who behind s2x attack. So better not to wait, just close account now
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:07:26
Wrong. It is the biggest attack we had. But it will fail
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:07:51
Very informative. Noobs please read it
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:09:39
They decide just one thing to mine in profit or in less profit and loose over competitors.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:56:32
No matter what they are banning. Who cares? They did it already many tines. So what? It's impossible to ban
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:00:09
Run full node if you wanna secure decentralized bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:55:13
They haven't activated segwit yet? Do they support NYA?
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:07:58
Oh really?
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:57:51
Bread wallet don't care about attacks and they will follow only the longest chain. So I wouldn't recommend this wallet. Better move your coins out of their wallet before split
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:07:21
Why people use coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:44:46
I guess 2x miners want to increase difficulty for main chain and after fork big % of hashpower will switch for a while to 2x chain and this will cause to a very slow blocks on main chain and start propoganda how core is bad etc.  But since market is rational so it's just a temporary disruption
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:44:16
 Bitcoin is upgraded version of currency, better.
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:02:50
Indeed. But that shows human stupiness. Propoganda works well
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:22:42
Yep, trezor is safe
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:48:27
Agreements are fired in decentralized world. You can agree whatever you want, but in reality users don't give a shit
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:27:46
Bitcoin 2years ago 500 EUR, bitcoin now 7000 EUR. Hmm tough choice what to hold better. Lol
@_date: 2018-07-22 06:41:14
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:24:38
Great explanation!
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:16:28
Xapo is a scam company. Do not use them
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:11:50
Bought bitcoins with lambo
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:47:57
Simple. Close your coinbase.com account, as they are goona to fraud users after November. And just hold your coins
@_date: 2018-07-14 11:40:17
Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:22:26
Ordinary FUD from ver's troll. Go try somewhere else
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:32:53
Segwit for sure
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:57:49
Or probably will hit 1 usd before it hits 1M usd
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:05:25
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:15:59
Stupid post. They are scammers everybody knows that
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:31:23
It does
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:07:45
Damn, bitcoin again dead
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:29:25
Why they never ban mining in China? Think about that.
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:31:09
Report as inaccurate information with some feedback
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:13:37
Avoid nya signed companies. Use newest full node.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:03:59
Never buy bcash, just dump it
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:32:32
Better buy bitcoin. And watch porn for free
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:46:49
Spam transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:43:55
Sorry english is not my native language, but still thank you for the tip.
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:21:17
But there are plenty of platforms with fiat support
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:08:13
Business will not support 2x bcs it's a suicide for them. Miners follow the money, simple. I ignored all these attemps to compromise bitcoin and what we see now? Bitcoin almost all time high. They want to brainwash ppl brains. Better ignore them
@_date: 2018-04-21 08:00:51
They are enemy of bitcoin, they supported s2x, this madness with bcash, CEO shilling with ETH. I would never keep btc in coinbase
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:34:30
Unstoppable scammer
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:30:46
Yes that's gonna be with B2x and all other attempts
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:37:04
Definitely not bcash
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:18:13
Bread wallet long time compromised. Stay away from them!
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:43:43
Bcash road map is dead end. You are missing the main point. But I don't wanna argue with stupid random incognito
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:47:48
Can somebody tell me, why ppl use coinbase at all? Seriously, why???
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:20:15
Sorry but no to OB. You made your mistake
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:36:00
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:31:06
Yeah. That's what I mean
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:55:03
Roger Ver should be banned from the internet
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:25:56
Yes. America is not a whole world. You need to deal with it
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:48:10
Doing this daily
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:27:53
Butpay got investments from fraudsters like Roger Ver and they became completed garbage. Do not use them, they are scamming users with extra fees and no segwit implementation
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:51:02
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:30:12
Goodbye scam, hello new scam

Stupid comment
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:34:10

The only one true mining pool. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-09 10:07:07
Bitmain cartel want to keep higher fees for big blocks debate, they don't wanna low fees. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 08:52:49
Very bad
@_date: 2018-12-03 08:12:48
And today difficulty will reduce by 15%. Guess who will come back?
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:59:12
Read wise
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:25:34
Worst company I have ever seen

Perfectly written!
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:55:20
You better hurry up :)
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:58:42
Sure it will. But not this year
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:34:42
Btcpayserver. No bcash and LN!
@_date: 2018-12-30 06:26:02
Bcash is scam
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:13:40
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:49:41
Real pump and dump, or maybe not
@_date: 2018-12-03 08:20:17
Good luck, SEC!

The best time to invest was yesterday. The 2nd best time is now
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:54:27
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:06:46
It’s not a wife, no need to love. It’s just a rational move to integrate the future of payments, and shitcoins killer aka Stellar or bcash
@_date: 2019-05-20 06:16:50
Very likely
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:48:58
Legend. Respect!
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:52:05
I guess they focus more on brainwash and scam noobs
