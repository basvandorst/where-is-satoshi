What Satoshi "intended" to happen is a highly invalid argument not based in any fact. People try to treat Satoshi's ideas like they are the ideas of a god. The christian god intended for people not to sin, should we follow that? Stop spreading a totally invalid argument. He/They were just normal people with a opinion, not facts.

These subs are like two sides of a coin. They have different opinions on the way in which bitcoin should go forward. Remember no sub has the right answer, both of these subs are dedicated to a different ideal. One is for BU, the other is for SegWit. Both with valid arguments but it usually just turns into a flame war when there is a debate, hence the two subs. I like to read both to have the best possible understanding, since you can't know whats right if you don't know whats wrong.

SEPA transfer to Kraken is how i've bought more after moving away from Coinbase, thats a 0.14% fee. Takes a couple of days, Thats the only downside.

How can Some americans be so arrogant, i cant even believe the stupidity sometimes. Does casting the world into financial crisis by subprime loans not deserve regulation? American Jobs are not end all be all. There are Jobs for people who are skilled enough, every jobbo out there does not deserve a job for existing.

Stop trying to justify your own opinion when people with knowledge of the US legal system clearly have stated it is not possible. If you want other opinions post to broaden your views by all means post, but dont be so ignorant.

Well yes for insanely small amounts of btc, it makes little sense to move such small amounts around anyway.

Im curious about the BU against SegWit debate since microtransactions would make bitcoin more useful for a large number of people, who would be against something so crucial in mass adoption? (Remember this is from an economists perspective)

Do you mean a Bear trap?
