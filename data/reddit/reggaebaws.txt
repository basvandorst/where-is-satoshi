Who are these fucking retards that are selling?
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:26:11
So... minor dip or big one? Can't decide if u should sell my alts in time this time or hodl.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:12:18
How will they survive?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:35:21
So will it continue to crash when asia wakes up in a couple of hours?
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:25:15
Please asia see that we are on a rebound when u wake up
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:18:45
Can someone please harpoon these fucking whales?
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:27:57
FFS can january and this shit just stop already.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:13:46
When it's going UP?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:51:05
I hope you are right:)
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:49:23
Why can't it seem to push above 12k? When it's near it dips back to like 11500 again.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:12:59
Why is it dipping again? Like who does that "ohh the worst is over and BTC is up to 12k again... PANIC SELLLL" ???
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:09:39
Which says something about many "investors".
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:40:24
Is this inability to break 12k worrisome?
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:02:47
Fast and cheap?��
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:14:07
So when will the price start going up instead of sideways?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:22:34
Pizza is 2$ where u live?
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:04:24
What is the best alternative to Coinbase for FIAT -&gt; BTC? In eu.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:56:30
So why is btc going sideways currently? U Think we Will see another dip or are we just waiting for the banks to open after the holidays?
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:02:00
He is going to start posting images to make it harder for bots.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:31:41
Buy now or wait a couple of days?
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:30:43
Will yanks wake up and FOMO this to the moon?  
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:16:29
Actually it was at 9987$ at CMC for a while.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:44:43
So the rise has cooled down. Will America gas it up when they wake up?
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:49:53
Climbing upwards again? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:22:30
Wrong way!
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:34:11
So how will EU react, pump or dump? We are waking up now. Im going to buy some.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:00:45
So... you guys think this has turned the tide? No reason for the crash to continue now?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:37:12
Have we found a bottom? It has been jumping around between 7600-7700 for hours now.
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:25:07
Buy now or when it dips to 50k.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:11:01
Wrong way!!!
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:55:25
Going to bed... up to asia if i wake up happy or miserable��
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:57:10
God... I have to stop looking at Delta in the middle of the night.. saw 11300.. got a dopamine high, couldnt fall asleep for three hours... and when I finally do I wake up to 10600. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:13:10
U that say we will dip to 5k etc, what do u base this on? There is no new FUD causing ppl to sell?
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:02:57
First! Predictions for today?
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:12:14
Thats what I like to hear!
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:26:32
... /s or just woke up?:)
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:22:09
Sorry but english isn't the first language of a majority of the inhabitants of this planet...
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:27:58
Any educated guess what the bottom will be? Waiting for the right moment to buy in.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:50:14
Its been above 8k for like 5+ days now except a short stop at 9k and 7900, isnt this a good thing? You all acting like 5k is inbound?
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:49:21
So how low does it go? Help me to not panic.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:29:12
We killed the asian rebound already, its up to the yanks now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:32:30
If Bitcoin goes to around 6500 I will be able to triple my alt coin holdings, assuming they keep following bitcoin movements. But don't know if I should be this greedy, and instead buy now. Will we see sub 7000?
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:57:12
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:59:41
I am! I am!!
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:39:47
Who is selling? People that don't like money?
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:19:56
Not really. Up 5x my initial investment (from 20x doh...), so I wouldn't have these cash if not for crypto. I will be able to convert what I need to fiat end of feb, but would suck if it is a bigger share of my folio than it needs to be.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:47:07
This means buying little bit everyday?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:22:47
How much truth do we think there is behind this new China FUD?
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:59:21
Lamborghini Aventador. Golden.
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:59:47
Because I need to turn some of my profits to fiat end of february and would be unfortunate if we are at the bottom of another "dip" at that point.
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:51:24
Why's it crashing now?!
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:35:40
So you guys think we will bounce off above 10k again after EU has had their morning coffee?
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:00:38
Okey, so who got the crystal ball? How low are we going? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:46:31
Hopefully it goes much lower, since I have tethered up.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:32:02
Tether or do you think we will bounce up soon? (inb4 downvotes because tether mention)
