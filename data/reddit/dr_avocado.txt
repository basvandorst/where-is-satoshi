No. It is a checking account. That means whatever you want to spend with the debit card you will get will HAVE to already be in the account. It isn't a line of credit. I think you're getting confused, because sometimes you can open a line of credit with a savings / checking account. However, poor credit has no bearing on if you can get a checking account or what kind of fees you pay.

I don't think Exxon-Mobil's profit plan is built around convincing you to come inside to buy a snickers bar. Yes they have low profit margins, but at insanely high volumes.

That's interesting. I suppose I could definitely see a small family owned station relying on you going into the store.

Please do me a favor; next time you go to the bank, ask them. Because there is no amount of common sense that is going to convince you. I don't know the specifics of your friend's case, but then again neither do you if you think he's being denied for a checking account due to bad credit.

Yes it is a current loss, everyone gets that. But if you bail out every time you're at a "loss" you're going to be one shit investor.

Umm, what? That's irrelevant. He's opening a checking account, not a line of credit.

Why not? Both are easy ways to pay online, why shouldn't they be compared? Bitcoin has an obvious flaw that makes it risky to use online until a system like Paypal or visa cards is made for them.
