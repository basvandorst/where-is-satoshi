Not a sockpuppet or a troll, but let this be a lesson to the rest of you junior Gordon Gekkos. 
This isn't the stock market, or a traditional currency market. This is bitcoin, and if you give up control of your bitcoin or other crypto by sending it to an address locked up by a private key you don't control its no longer your bitcoin. This is a mathematical fact and no amount of tears, lawsuits, or your government's guns is going to change that. 
Learn from the lessons of others and don't get goxxed again. Wait for exchange technology to mature or live on the sword edge and die by the same fate.

Well if any fucking future magic tech is on the table then no one can ever make a statement, a recommendation, or demonstrate a preference about anything. 
He's talking about the currently available tech, and because the blockchain is such an advanced idea and those ideas only come once every few decades it's easy to hypothesize that no other blockchain replacements will be coming soon. 
Therefore Odom has made an educated guess that the dominant version of this new advanced tech (the bitcoin blockchain) and its network effect will continue dominating. 
If you disagree with this premise then argue that but committing a fallacy by strawmanning his argument just makes you look dumb and those who upvoted you even dumber. Don't be obtuse.

His entire idea is building a low cost self driving upgrade kit for $1000 bucks. If he can do it using Chinese bullshit off of amazon that isn't even purpose built for his needs he can definitely do it with gear built to his future spec.


Well he's built a prototype with it and it's working. Maybe he should have waited a few more years and taken on some investors so he could buy a USB hub that is up to your automotive environment standards. Or, like everything winners like Geohot do, he can just build the shit now and worry later. 
You don't make a billion dollar unicorn startup by being a pussy. Which is why guys like you will always work for guys like him. If he'd even have you, which I doubt. Maybe your D-level ambition might be picked up by a C-level manager looking for someone to fill a temporary gap, but at least you got in before the stock options all but dried up.

Here's what would be necessary to bruteforce a bitcoin private key. Good fucking luck.
Imagine you built a perfect computer; forget about GHash and Megahertz.  
You built a computer which used the absolute minimum amount of energy theoretically possible to record a change in a single bit (1 to 0 or 0 to 1).  
We are talking about the limits of thermodynamics; nothing more efficient is even possible.  
Now imagine you used most of the natural resources in our star system to construct a dyson sphere and covered the entire surface of this sphere with a single star system sized super computer.  
Now imagine you could keep this supercomputer cooled at roughly absolute zero and could do so without expending any additional energy.
If you had that and captured (with no inefficiency or loss) the entire energy output of our star (not just in a day or week but continually until it burned out) you couldn't COUNT to 2^256 before you ran out of energy.   
Keep in mind this is simply counting.  
Just counting, not hashing, not comparing, not performing lookups just counting 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. .... 2^256-1.
This program couldn't finish even using all the energy in our star system.
These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.

Panel 1: Corporations own the government!
His concern is that because the government is owned and controlled by entities (corporations) that have different supposed incentive structures than government (i.e profit vs the "will" of the "governed") they will use their ownership to control government for their own gain.
Panel 2 A: They need to be regulated!
Corporations need to regulated from having the ability to own government. So that government is once again a well oiled machine for exercising the "will" of the "governed."
Panel 2 B: By whom.
Who should regulate the corporations ownership?
Panel 3: The government!
Completing the circular logic the third panel states that the government should regulate the corporations. This is akin to saying that a mistreated slave who is owned by a master who is mistreating him should regulate the master from further mistreatment.
If corporations own the government and need to be regulated to no longer have such ownership; how is a government owned by the corporations ever going to make a regulation which is against it's own self interested ownership?

This seems to be their fee for arbitration. 


Meaning that if there is no dispute between the buyer and the seller (90% of all online transactions) there is no fee. However if the site owner must put in time collecting the facts of a transaction and investigating it fully in order to deliver a justified judgement then that is well worth 4%.
That 4% fee also gives the buyer and seller incentive to be civil and not screw each other over.

Here's what would be necessary to bruteforce a bitcoin private key.
Imagine you built a perfect computer; forget about GHash and Megahertz.  
You built a computer which used the absolute minimum amount of energy theoretically possible to record a change in a single bit (1 to 0 or 0 to 1).  
We are talking about the limits of thermodynamics; nothing more efficient is even possible.  
Now imagine you used most of the natural resources in our star system to construct a dyson sphere and covered the entire surface of this sphere with a single star system sized super computer.  
Now imagine you could keep this supercomputer cooled at roughly absolute zero and could do so without expending any additional energy.
If you had that and captured (with no inefficiency or loss) the entire energy output of our star (not just in a day or week but continually until it burned out) you couldn't COUNT to 2^256 before you ran out of energy.   
Keep in mind this is simply counting.  
Just counting, not hashing, not comparing, not performing lookups just counting 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. .... 2^256-1.
This program couldn't finish even using all the energy in our star system.
These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.

    idea |īˈdēə|
    noun
    1 a thought or suggestion as to a possible course of action
In the same breath you call anti-fragile a made up word you make up the word "pseudo-idea" which lexicographically makes absolutely no sense. 
Anti means "opposed to" and fragility means "easily breakable" so anti-fragile means it's opposed to being easily breakable.
Your word "pseudo-idea" makes no sense because the word pseudo means "resembling or imitating" and idea means "a **suggestion** of a possible course of action" so how can something imitate a suggestion of a possible course of action?

(1 digit )*(26+26+10) = 62 possible combinations
This assumes that the last digit is the one he remembered.
However there are 51 characters in an uncompressed bitcoin private key (one that starts with 5).
So that would mean that in the private key on the right he would have 50 characters and the missing character could be any space in between two characters of the 50, 50 spaces assuming that we haven't tried the last character and he didn't just remove the 5. So the new equation is.
(50 spaces) * (1 digit) * (26+26+10) = 3100 possible combinations
You could probably crack that with a pen and paper.

Won't put ApplePay to shame but it would be a step in the right direction. What the typical consumer gets out of a relationship with ApplePay is less friction. They already know the experience of paying for apps on their iOS devices and Macs is seamless. Now they can have that in stores. 
The problem with Google Wallet is it's never been frictionless. It always seemed like a bit of a hack because the Google ecosystem is quite fragmented between hundreds of companies who all think their smarter than Google (I'm looking at you Samsung) and know better. 
This leads to a disjointed user experience which can been frustrating for the end user which leads to them looking for a better solution to their problem. In steps ApplePay and the advantage that Apple has being the only one who has iOS running on their own hardware. So the fragmentation problem begins and ends with them. Google can't claim that, for nerds like us it's seen as an advantage. For the common middle class American/European or upper middle class rest of the worlder it's seen as a hinderance.
Google adding Bitcoin integration into Google Wallet would probably end up forcing more large companies to jump into the pool and eventually Apple will be one of them. So I agree that it will be helpful for everyone if Google adopts Bitcoin for Google Wallet.

DPR was sloppy, I wish he had multisig, but he paid the ultimate price to show us what these bastards are all about. In a marketplace of voluntary interactions the government brought guns and violence to the party. He created a system that made people's live's safer. 
I'm upset that the US government thinks they have the right to point guns in people's faces and take their shit. They are no different than the millions of violent hordes that have existed since the first violent looter parasites and moocher hitchhikers latched on to the productive a hundred thousand years ago.
Bitcoin was created to put an end to this. It will succeed within the next two decades. Effort now has an objective value that can't simply be taken at the point of a gun. Good luck taking something you can't even prove I own.
All the weapons, tanks, bombs, drones, and jackbooted thugs ready to commit the government's violence can't solve a difficult math problem. Good fucking luck.

One night a school of white fish washed up into the shallow waters of a small costal town. Townspeople who were awake grabbed any container they could to fill with the white fish who were there for the taking. By morning there were still white fish left but not in the quantities of the previous night. After a day people had to get in little boats to catch the remainder of the school. After a week everything was back to normal and people had to go out to sea in large boats to get white fish.

It's a single digit, how long do you think it would take a computer to do an operation that inserted a character 0-9, A-Z, a-z into each of the spaces between two characters in the private key then compare that with the public key that is generated. Your phone could probably do it in 20 seconds.
The mathematical calculation of determining spent outputs to send a bitcoin transaction is far more taxing on your processor.
Also the rarity of valid private keys means that there would only be one private key that is validly generated so which ever public key that is generated would be his public key. That ring will be his undoing.

The Bitcoin protocol is based on the incentives and voluntary interactions of those involved.
The "Current System" is based on a few bankers in a room with no duty to the people, the congress, or the president. They make decisions on their own and force the rest of the world to swallow them.
With Bitcoin miners are always going to move to a pool to thwart a 51% attack because it will do nothing but bring their value down. The same with any large mining pool, why would they jeopardize the sell price and future success of bitcoin to attack the network. It's against their own self interest and therefore they have zero incentive to do so.
With the "Current System" bankers have every incentive to debase the currency because they can simply add more numbers to their own banks accounts and the accounts of their friends to constantly stay ahead of inflation.
Fiat is bondage, bitcoin is the future.

Deflationary spirals are a myth.
There's a simple reason why I would spend my money today rather than tomorrow (when it's worth more). Because I'm a HUMAN and I need food because I'm hungry and without it I will die. There is always going to be a market for food, water, shelter, time saving widgets/services, and other comforts that allow humans to live a better life.
The market will simply correct to provide those things that people want because they make their lives worth living. Things that aren't as essential, trinkets and other subsidized chattel, will simply be produced less or not at all according to demand.

Well that's just silly. The free market is punishing him for staying hushed up and not revealing solvency. If Mt. Gox ever comes back they will never reach the heights they previously did and therefore will never be a major player when bitcoin really takes off in the next 5 years. 
They've fucked some people in the short term and we are seeing the repercussions in their market price. People will continue to trade with the funds that they have stuck on the site but people aren't going to be trusting them in the future. 
More regulation isn't the answer and with smart contracts and distributed companies coming up soon no regulators will be able to regulate future businesses anyway. This is a reputation issue clear and simple, and Karpales and Mt. Gox will be radioactive if they are indeed found to be insolvent and he isn't telling anybody.

Bitcoin is a child of the free market. The free market is a natural, organic process like evolution, the fittest survive and thrive, the weak die and are culled. We need these weak businesses to die out so they don't come back to fuck us in the ass later, like Gox.
Stop keeping your bitcoin on exchanges and don't let anyone control your private keys but you. If an exchange disappears off the face of the earth and you lose your bitcoin then your weakness is playing right into the free market's evolutionary hands.

Well if you are going to make custom implementations of software to interpret a protocol that is still actively in development when the rest of the industry uses something else and you're also not following best industry practices for your custom implementation then you're going to have a bad time. 
Mt. Gox has a styrofoam foundation built out of desperation (to be first) and ignorance in PHP. Since then they have used bandaids, popsicle sticks, and bubble gum to repair that foundation rather than scrapping the whole thing an implementing a brand new site out of concrete and steel from scratch. It was a huge mistake.
Mt. Gox has been around for about four years and made tens of millions of dollars, they could have easily hired out for audits and gotten their code up to snuff but instead they decided to stay the course through sheer hard headedness and now they're paying the ultimate price with the loss of their brand and reputation. Sadly they are taking a lot of people with them. 
Hopefully they will be able to pay everyone back then vanish into that free market blackhole where all incompetent companies end up, so that they may be seen as a lesson for future generations and scrapped for their serviceable parts.

You take a picture of your credit card and iOS propagates that information into the correct fields. Because of how the secure data area of the new A8 chip works that data is sequestered and isn't exposed to Apple. They don't know your information and don't want it, nor do merchants have access to that information. Because Apple isn't an information technologies company they have little to gain. Google on the other hand is an information technologies company, and when your best asset is search, everything looks like a database.

I won't buy it and I'm suggesting others do the same. This product has a poor security model for a company with no reputation in the market, who is just starting out. I have no reason to trust them yet and neither do you. Maybe over the course of a few years they'll get there but this is a poor start. I'm knocking them using facts, reason and logic to formulate a coherent argument. 
You can't just tell someone to buy something else and then present no facts to support your argument. I say this isn't a secure product and you've done nothing to prove me wrong.

Case is extremely secure because it is built on top of a multi-signature, multi-factor architecture with no single point of failure. Your bitcoin wallet has three keys and two of them are needed to complete a transaction. One key is embedded on the device so it is secured by the possession factor. No one can gain access to this key without having possession of the device. However, this key isn’t enough to complete a transaction. A second key is stored on our servers and transactions are only signed by the server key if the fingerprint scan is a match so this key is secured by a biometric factor. That means even if your device is lost or our servers are compromised, your bitcoins are safe. A third key sits in an offline vault and is only used if you ever lose your Case to help your recover your bitcoins.


Don’t worry - your bitcoins are safe. Since only one of the three keys has been lost, whoever finds or steals your Case can’t access your bitcoins. If you lose your Case, just use our online recovery process. We’ll ask you to verify some information like your email address and phone number. This information layer will unlock the offline vault key. We’ll then mail you a fingerprint scanner that you can use to unlock the biometrically secured server key and recover your bitcoins.
They hold 2 of 3 private keys. The only ones you have access to are stored in your case. If compelled by the government or hacked by some means Case has the ability to steal your bitcoins. Be weary of this. Never store more than a bitcoin on this thing.

The fact that 21 can do micropayments because they have a large mining interest that prioritizes mining transactions from their 21 computers no matter the size of the transaction fee. 
So while you might be able to sell access to your API for a few bucks a month 21 can scale down to exactly the amount of API calls a developer actually uses down to half a Satoshi. So at the end of the day developers will be getting much more value out of buying API access from someone selling them through a 21 computer instead of buying them on a monthly, bi-monthly, or annual basis.

You can send bitcoins using blockchain.info wallets. Personally I wouldn't trust it, but one of the ways that it looks like they may have gotten past the Apple censor is by adding a license agreement when you toggle the send bitcoin option on which absolves Apple from anything that happens while using the app to send bitcoins.
If this app is still around in a month maybe blockchain.info could use a similar tactic to get their wallet app reaccepted into the App Store.

I'm starting to think that Mr. D'Angelo might not know what he's talking about. He spits a good game but putting 21 and Bitfury in the same category is ridiculous. 
21 is a company who has interest in creating a microtransaction and development platform for providing access to online services (API, Wifi, Cloud Computing, etc.) and allowing customers to pay down to the half-Satoshi for what they use from those services. To do that they have access to mining power to guarantee that transactions made for their services will be quickly included in blocks no matter the fee. 
Bitfury as far as I can tell is just a mining operation. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but they are both very different.

Fiat monetary systems have been a known concept for almost 500 years, they didn't come to the US in a major way until about 100 years ago when society reached a point of civilization that could handle such an advanced concept.
A situation where society crumbles to the point that a character like Mad Max: Fury Road's Immortan Joe could rise to prominence.
No one is going to be trying to build a fiat currency system when they can't even get water reliably. They will fall back to the most reliable and stable currency of the last 4000 years... Gold. 
Then fiat can come from that once everything settles down which would likely be several decades later.

The current understanding of a social contract is this: because I fell out of my mother's vagina at a certain geographic location I am forever enslaved and forced to give a portion of my productive wealth to pay for the lives of people I don't know, who do little and produce less. 
These ideas will keep us on this rock until the heat death of the Universe. Without crypto, encryption, and their by products that make it improbable that anyone will be able to steal my wealth in the future; we'd be doomed to your social contracts and bonded and beholden to peopke who don't share our values by unfortunate geographic accidents of birth. 
Organizing societies and cultures by whim and random chance rather than values does nothing but create strife and conflict between peoples of different beliefs who have no hope of ever getting along. Being able to separate yourself from people you disagree with and unite yourself with people you agree with will quickly allow competing cultures to figure out if their ideas have real merit or if they're just blowing smoke up each other's asses. 
Social contracts have nothing to do with any of this. They are simply safety nets which incentivize bad judgement with those who have good judgement footing the bill.

I wish Cook spoke more about what the government actually wants them to do.
Basically the court order states that they want a new version of the system software that would bypass the ten try limit for the entry of a six-digit passcode on the lock screen AND they want Apple to include a way for them to do that entry electronically so that they don't have to enter all one million possible combinations by hand.
Apple has no access to the phone's secure enclave (a hardware secure key storage on the CPU with is considered uncrackable). It has been stated in myriad other cases, in this case however Apple is also refusing to help the FBI to bruteforce password entry.
Apple has nothing to gain and everything to lose by putting themselves out there so publicly as champions of security. If they were ever found out to be colluding with the government in ways which are counter to their public persona they'd be toast. Unlike Google which makes its money from advertising and knowing everything about its users, Apple makes its money from hardware and puts its reputation on the line every time they come out with a public statement about privacy being their top concern.

Because the iPhone 5c was just an iPhone 5 in a cheaper plastic shell. It was a cheaper version of a phone which used all of the same parts they'd already had in inventory.

Bitcoin could potentially replace all of the things I listed and still use less power than those industries. 
I was taking the power consumption to its extreme and showing that the Bitcoin network would still use less power. I'd also point out that people making the decision to be miners and buy power for whatever they want is their business. They wouldn't be doing it if it didn't provide value for them. 
I'm just sick of these stupid power arguments as if it's a problem only bitcoin has.

Ethereum scales horribly and will continue to do so until they get their highly experimental Casper POS and even more experimental Sharding going. These are still up in the air as far as release dates.
As more of these ICOs and tokens join the Ethereum network it will slow to a crawl and transaction times and fees with skyrocket. 
The problem with building everything on one blockchain is that if any flaws are found in that blockchain then every token based on that blockchain is effected.
Because Ethereum is "Turing Complete" the attack surface for exploiting Ethereum is enormous. This is because there are really no limits on what the Ethereum blockchain can do (as opposed to the limited Bitcoin blockchain) there are also no limits on the potential attacks that might be carried out against them.
Good luck to them. Vitalik is a fucking smart guy and Vlad is a rock star. Ethereum is just now leaving the port and their boat is made of Swiss cheese is taking on water quick.

LTC has none of the same fundamental flaws that ETH does. LTC is BTC with a faster block time and a different hashing algorithm. 
It will never be the dominant coin however. ETH won't be either. Too much surface area for potential attacks. It's trying to do everything in one layer which means if that layer has flaws not only does it take down everything ETH related it also takes down all of the ICO tokens that are built on the platform.

In anticipation of the halving many Chinese miners are holding on to their newly minted bitcoins which has driven up the price. So it's the scarcity of bitcoins available for sale on exchanges has shot the price up in the last week. Hence lower volume but higher prices. 
Unlike stock markets or national currencies which can be created adinfinitum, there will only be 21m bitcoins and that scarcity makes the bitcoin market behave differently than fiat markets where the supply can change drastically by simple human whim. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:13:34
I thought the feds considered bitcoin property or was that just one competing department while another considers it money and another considers it a threat to their sovereignty and yet another considers it to be a potential method of payment for governmental fines and fees. 
This is all whim based posturing ladies and gentlemen. The whim of powerful people holding a gun to your heads and forcing you to abide by whatever arbitrary rules they decide on from one moment to the next. 
Get out of the US and any other powerful nation state while you can, with BTC prices going up so sharply you're surely going to get caught in the cross fire of the death of the nation state. This is the beginning of their end and they're swinging blindly trying to maintain control. They're swinging will become more violent and wide sweeping as the nation state gets closer to its grave.

Now there are more players in the space than I could name. If the prices in exchanges with currency control around the world are any indication (way higher than US prices due to lack of bitcoin liquidity on their exchanges) we're in a bull market that will take us to the kinds of numbers people have been dreaming about for years.

You're the one sitting here promoting a known fraud, who faked private keys to get people to think he was Satoshi, this is known and proven, mathematically by some of the top security experts in the world.
What credibility does he have or deserve after such an ass blasting?

A successful SegWit activation will bring a tremendous boost in price and with it more economic incentive for big chip players (Intel, TSMC, AMD, Freescale, etc.) to enter the Bitcoin mining ASIC business.
Also as the limits of Moore's law is reached, with regard to circuit miniaturization on chips, ASIC mining chips will become more ubiquitous, cheaper, and eventually easier to produce by even small manufacturers and integrated into all sorts of devices that we use everyday. 
Bitmain will lose its edge the same way all "big" bitcoin businesses lost before. By failing their users (backdoors/AsicBoost) and/or getting eaten up by larger corporations who have better economies of scale.

He's a cancer and we created UASF and BIP148 to be Bitcoin's chemotherapy against that cancer. In the end he'll go down with the rest of the bitcoin losers no one remembers. 
We just need to be smart and get Segwit enabled and then the rest of his advantage (AsicBoost) will come crashing down around him. All of the promises he has made to the Chinese state will be null and void and he'll suffer the consequences for bringing state actors into this decentralized movement.

I don't give a shit what you're afraid of. BIP148 is happening and if you're not prepared you could lose all. Replay attacks will lock your coins in place for fear that you might lose SegWit or Legacy coins, or both. 
Any exchange, wallet, or business that doesn't prepare for BIP148 is doing a grave disservice to their customers. They'll lose reputation and market share when customers lose, can't spend or split their SegWit coins.
This fear coupled with the benefits of SegWit and a larger block size is the reason why UASF and BIP148 win. SegWit is safe, tested, and proven to work and makes killing ASICBOOST easier. 
Staying on the Legacy chain has no advantages.

Did you set this up on brainwallet.org or bitaddress.org?
If you set it up on brainwallet.org there are several options that you can check to make the password to address conversion change (Uncompressed vs Compressed for example).
I'd suggest you try a few combinations of checking those options on brainwallet.org and see if the correct address for your coins is generated.
If that fails then your wrote down your password incorrectly and need to check small variations of your password until you find the correct one. You can't trust anyone else to help you in this situation without risking the loss of all of the coins associated with that address.

A 30% speed increase with a potential for another 15% is technical competition. I'm not sure what the speed ratio between libbitcoin and bitcoind was to start with but bitcoind is Mike Hearn's (The Foundation) baby and libbitcoin is Unsystem's (cryptoanarchists) baby.
This is a technical competition which is philosophically based. Much like miners buying up mining power to out perform their competitors and to maintain market equilibrium and prevent 51% attacks. I don't understand how you can say this isn't a technical competition. They are two competing systems that fill a similar market need.

It's very difficult to buy BTC with a credit card. There aren't many places that take credit cards or Paypal because of the possibility of chargebacks.

Do not keep your bitcoins on Coinbase. Put them into a blockchain.info wallet or keep them on your computer in an encrypted state at the very least.
Keeping your bitcoins on Coinbase means that if one day they were to disappear off the face of the Earth (unlikely, but it has happened with many "reputable" businesses before) your bitcoins are gone and there is no way you can access them. 
The bitcoin system is about removing trust from the equation of money. Don't ever let anyone else have the ability to violate that trust.

First rule of bitcoin: Don't talk about how many you have.
Second rule of bitcoin: Don't talk about how many you have.
The reason for this is three-fold:
* If you have enough for it to be worth a hackers time, you're opening yourself up to a world of hurt.
* If a government ever decides to crack down on certain civilians they are going to start with those that they can prove the amount of, and threads like this are testimony.
* Might make newbies feel bad that they didn't get in on this earlier and discourage them from buying even though we are still very early in the BTC game.

3. Not as easy to manipulate as gold and silver because anyone can start a bitcoin exchange online. This will become even harder with the advent of distributed P2P exchanges.
4. Bitcoin is resilient against FUD because the good outweighs the bad in terms of it's attributes. The second someone sees that they can send $1 or a $1 million in the blink of an eye to anyone in the world for a few cents they're hooked.

Why would Charlie talk about the five to ten fold increase in demand in just a few weeks then say that we're in for a correction soon.
I never understand this line of reasoning. It would be much different if the demand never went up but the price was going up. That to me is a bubble, but an instance where supply can't meet demand is simply a lack of liquidity which takes us to new price levels.

Because this is fucking bitcoin, a system like the one that you are talking about could easily be used for bad by the government to freeze the accounts of people that it wanted to.
blockchain.info could never even implement this kind of safeguard, their site works in a way that makes it impossible. When you put in your password it is decrypting a file that has all of your private keys in the browser. That file can easily be downloaded and bruteforced. blockchain.info has no way to access your private keys. They don't store your password on their servers, it's all client side.
This could be implemented on Coinbase or some other site where your private keys are not controlled by you. But why the hell would you use a service like that to store bitcoins for more than a few seconds after purchasing them?

There is no reason for a company like Coinbase with money in the bank to behave like this.

If you'd like to be controlled by central planners with guns that is well within your right, but it is not right for you to force those central planners on me.
Bitcoin represents the end of their reign and the beginning of the freest period in human history.

There's a simple reason why I would spend my money today, because I'm a HUMAN and I need food because I'm fucking hungry and without it I will die. 
So now that we know that there is always going to be a market for food and water and shelter and other comforts that allow humans to live a better life; won't the market just correct to provide those things that people want because they make their lives worth living and not provide things that people don't want to buy?

There is no way that Mt. Gox will settle for an amount anywhere close to $75 million. First off, they don't have that amount of cash on hand. They're still running a small business, up until this month they were still running everything off of one server, a very fast server, but one server all the same. Secondly, Coinlab doesn't have anything but vaporware and false promises. Remember they started out as a company who wanted leverage gamer's GPUs to mine coins (when FPGAs were mining and ASICs were announced) then did a 180 and became a bitcoin exchange. They are not a sound company and do not have sound leadership.
Also Mt. Gox is a Japanese company owned by a Frenchman. They have no funds in the United States and no one connected to the company is a US citizen. Suing a foreign company from the US is very difficult when they have no US ties. Coinlab is suing Mt. Gox out of desperation. They are going for a quick settlement.
However I do agree with you that when this deal was made BTC was sitting around $18. Now that it's five times higher the stakes are higher and Mt. Gox figures it's worth the trouble of dealing with US regulations without having a middleman like Coinlab and their shitty leadership muddling their largest client base.

21 million is a hard number. There will never be anymore (there could be if voted on by the miners, but honestly who would vote to have their incentive diluted?).
Theoretically the sun will destroy Earth in four billion years, yet it's not something we actively worry about today.
Bitcoin currently goes to eight decimal places and can easily be expanded to more. As long as there is one bitcoin left in existence the currency will continue.
Also current encryption schemes might be cracked using a quantum computer in 20 or 30 years, meaning old coin addresses will likely become the target of "treasure hunting" operations. People will invest lots of money the crack the private keys on old addresses.

Because they knew there wouldn't likely be much of a recourse if they couldn't pay up. Mt. Gox has enough problems, and has had fairly bad business judgement in the past. I'm not here to defend Gox, I think they are a mom and pop shop that have been around since the beginning and therefore have the place at the table they currently have.

That is a government that has connections (aid, banking, etc.) with the United States. Mt. Gox has no such connections. The owners of Mt. Gox aren't even American. This is going to be a long drawn out process spanning many years longer than anyone will even remember the existence of Coinlab. It's start-up desperation to show the VCs results so that Vessenes won't be blacklisted by them from ever receiving backing in the future. He can always point back to this and say that he fights tooth and nail to protect his investors.
Please remember that Coinlab's original business model was to install software on gamer's computers to leverage their GPUs and mine coins with them... this was after people were already mining with FPGAs and ASICs had already been announced. Coinlab then did a complete 180 and wanted to be a bitcoin exchange.

Blockchain.info just stores an encrypted version of a small wallet file. Everything is decrypted client side. Blockchain.info has absolutely no idea what is in that wallet file as there is no server side decryption. Blockchain.info could therefore never "tax their users’ wallets and transactions." It's literally not possible.
Coinbase on the other hand is a different story. 
Let's look at this rationally. If you had a bunch of bitcoins stored on a site that you knew was going to steal part of your wealth would you keep your money there? Of course not, this isn't the dark ages this is the bitcoin age, you can be your own bank and store your coins on your own computer.
If a site like coinbase started snitching to the government about your holdings they would die and people would move on to something else.
This "article" wasn't well researched and regardless of the bullshit that it spouts throughout bitcoin marks the end of the government, they cannot co-exist. As long as we have the internet we have bitcoin, as long as we have bitcoin taxes are dead (who would pay voluntary taxes to a wasteful government?), without taxes government cannot survive as they make no money on their own.

I don't think the globe will collapse I think that states and their monopoly on force and violence will cease to exist leaving room for voluntary interactions between free people. So bitcoin fits right into my philosophy.
Bitcoin wouldn't be crippled by exchanges shutting down it simply wouldn't have a dollar value that is as high as it is now, or maybe it will if Bernanke keeps inflating this money supply like a crazy person.
Also you must take into account that the world is a lot bigger than the United States.

I really like Coinbase as a company. However controlling your own private keys in a secured format on a site with an open source and JS verifier is far more secure than on some company's website run by some nice guys with a pro interface.
I've been around the Bitcoin community since 2010 and there have been a lot of nice people come and go. Some fucked people over (MyBitcoin/Bitcoinica) and others got fucked over by their own ignorance(Bitfloor/Bitcoinica). The only way to make sure they don't get you when they go is to take trust out of the equation. Blockchain.info does that, Coinbase does not.
Storing your coins on Coinbase is the difference between having a 40 ton safe in your house with a 20 digit code (blockchain.info) and storing your coins at your mom's house in a tin lock box (Coinbase).
If Coinbase ever got hacked, you're fucked. If Coinbase ever went offline for an extended period of time, you're fucked. If Coinbase ever decided to disappear off the face of the Earth with your bitcoins ala MyBitcoin, you're fucked.
NEVER STORE YOUR BITCOINS IN AN ONLINE WALLET WHERE YOU DO NOT CONTROL THE PRIVATE KEYS.
If any of the scenarios that I described were to happen at blockchain.info odds are your bitcoins would be protected by simply opening your backup in Multibit. With Coinbase there are no such backups, nor any level of assurance that your private keys and coins are secure.
All that said, Coinbase is a wonderful service to buy/sell coins, just don't keep them there longer than you have to.

The four horseman of the infopocalypse (terrorists, drug dealers, pedophiles, and organized crime) are definitely good boogiemen that they will use against bitcoin. 
However government's main weaknesses are inefficiency and slowness. By the time they actually get around to "banning" bitcoin there will be many more users. Among those users will be a lot of major financial companies who own politicians (lobbyists/favors) and dangerous types who want to hide their wealth from prying eyes (organized crime, drug cartel operations). These people will all have an incentive to keep bitcoin as free as possible, anything that negatively effects the price will not be tolerated.
These are just some of the potential problems that a government (specifically the US) will face in banning bitcoin.

There are many more companies than just Mt. Gox who sell BTC. A lot of this recent upward trend can be attributed to Coinbase making it so easy to buy BTC, which they get from Mt. Gox.

If coinbase goes offline, gets hacked, or disappears your coins go with them. 
NEVER STORE YOUR COINS IN AN ONLINE WALLET!
Just ask the people who got screwed over by MyBitcoin, bitcoinica, and bitfloor.
The instant that you trade them send them to a wallet you control the private keys of. I would recommend blockchain.info.
Coinbase is great for buying with fees at 1%.
blockchain is great for storage as your keys are yours and your password is the only thing that can unlock your coins.

I'm not saying that I disagree that they breached a contract. They quite possibly could have. All I'm saying is that Peter Vessenes is smoking crack if he thought it was good business sense to make such an exclusive contract knowing you would have little more than zero recourse had the contract gone south (which he is alleging it did).
Therefore it leads me to the conclusion that either a terrible business man (shocker) or the less likely conclusion that he knows exactly what he's doing and will get the $75 million he's asking for when his company has done nothing, is hemorrhaging money, made promises all over town, and has nothing to show for it.

blockchain.info wallets generate addresses clientside on the fly they don't store a large number of addresses ahead of time like the QT client.
You could change your password. Create a new address and send all of your BTC to that new address from all of your old addresses combined as one transaction and be alright. If you were playing it real safe because you thought your password was in jeopardy you'd create a new wallet altogether.

Wrong. Lincoln didn't give a shit about slavery. If this were true the Emancipation Proclamation would have started the "Civil War" not ended it. Ending slavery was a final fuck you to the Confederate States of America, a punishment for their rebellion. Slavery is the USA's greatest shame, but Lincoln deserves little credit for it's abolition, he was a white supremacist.
Thomas DiLorenzo lays the smack down on Lincoln in his book "The Real Lincoln." Here is an article with Lincoln quotes taken from "The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln." All quotations are cited.
Here's a sample:
**LINCOLN WAS AN OBSESSIVE WHITE SUPREMACIST**
"Free them [blacks] and make them politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of this . . . . We can not then make them equals." (CW, Vol. II, p. 256).
"There is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people, to the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black races" (CW, Vol. II, p. 405).
"What I would most desire would be the separation of the white and black races" (CW, Vol. II, p. 521).
"I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and black races . . . . I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong, having the superior position. I have never said anything to the contrary." (CW, Vol. III, p. 16).
"I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races . . . . I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people . . ." (CW, Vol, III, pp. 145-146).
"I will to the very last stand by the law of this state, which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes." (CW, Vol. III, p. 146).
"Senator Douglas remarked . . that . . . this government was made for the white people and not for negroes. Why, in point of mere fact, I think so too." (CW, Vol. II, p. 281).
**Until His Dying Day, Lincoln Plotted to Deport all the Black People Out of America**
"I have said that the separation of the races is the only perfect preventive of amalgamation . . . . Such separation . . . must be effected by colonization" [to Liberia, Central America, anywhere]. (CW, Vol. II, p. 409).
"Let us be brought to believe it is morally right , and . . . favorable to . . . our interest, to transfer the African to his native clime . . ." (CW, Vol. II, p. 409).
"The place I am thinking about having for a colony [for the deportation of all American blacks] is in Central America. It is nearer to us than Liberia." (CW, Vol. V, pp. 373, 374).
**LINCOLN ONLY RHETORICALLY OPPOSED SOUTHERN SLAVERY. IN PRACTICE, HE STRENGTHENED IT**
" I think no wise man has perceived, how it [slavery] could be at once eradicated, without producing a greater evil, even to the cause of human liberty himself." (CW, Vol. II, p. 130).
"I meant not to ask for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia." (CW, Vol., II, p. 260).
"I believe there is no right, and ought to be no inclination I the people of the free states to enter into the slave states and interfere with the question of slavery at all." (CW, Vol. II, p. 492).
"I have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists." (CW, Vol. III, p. 16).
"I say that we must not interfere with the institution of slavery . . . because the constitution forbids it, and the general welfare does not require us to do so." (CW, Vol. III, p. 460).
**LINCOLN CHAMPIONED THE FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT**
"I do not now, nor ever did, stand in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave law." (CW, Vol., III., p. 40).
"[T]he people of the Southern states are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave Law." (CW, Vol. III, p. 41).

I have recommended Coinbase to many big buyers in the past. My time is valuable and I don't want to be in the financial services market. I don't want to make a Coinbase competitor. I buy bitcoins from who ever I can as fast as I can and lately Coinbase has come to a crawl.
Buying at a price 5 days in advance and PRAYING that the price goes up and your order goes through and that you can still transfer your coins out of the coinbase site is a lot man. It's bassackwards compared to a lot of other sites and there isn't a good reason for it.
If you're presenting a professional product act like other professionals in your field. If you're going to change the game don't slow it down.

He sounds scared, like he's been under pressure to show results and when it wasn't as easy as he thought it was going to be he turned tail. It's been two months. You don't make an announcement like the one that Coinlab prematurely made unless you're desperate. 
If you remember Coinlab announced like two days before Mt. Gox even admitted there were ongoing talks.
This dude is desperate, the VCs aren't happy with the lack of results and therefore Peter is panicking to show them that their money is being well spent... on a lawsuit... with a company in Japan... who has no offices or connections (citizens) in the US...

Deflationary spirals are a myth.
There's a simple reason why I would spend my money today rather than tomorrow (when it's worth more). Because I'm a HUMAN and I need food because I'm hungry and without it I will die.
There is always going to be a market for food and water and shelter and other comforts that allow humans to live a better life.
The market will simply correct to provide those things that people want because they make their lives worth living. Things that people don't want to buy, trinkets and other subsidized chattel, will simply be produced less or not at all according to demand.

The more important question is now that the cat is out of the bag, how could the US government possibly stop it?
They can't even stop drugs and weapons from entering prisons. Bitcoin may not replace the dollar any time soon, but the US government would have to shut down the entire internet in the entire world to stop bitcoin and they can't even do anything about bittorrent.

You stealing someone's property is probably the most violent thing that you can do to another individual. If I caught you in my house stealing from me and I shot you in the fucking face to stop you, I'd be perfectly within my rights. If you stole them from my computer and I found you, I'd do whatever I had to to retrieve my property.
In this case the government is stealing the property of nonviolent people and locking them in cages. They have not acted violently against anyone. You, in your shitty analogy, would have been initiating violence by stealing my property.

I think having 750k people lose their lives is a far worse form of tyranny. Slavery is horrible, but the United States was the only country in the history of the world to go to war to end it. For the total cost of the civil war all of the slaves in the CSA could have been purchased from their masters hundreds of times over. Outlaw slavery, pay masters for their "property," free slaves, no organized murder, no Sherman's march to the sea, no death, no destruction. England did exactly this and they are much further along than the US in terms of race relations.

You sell something that most people nowadays consider to be free. 
You also don't have a lot of variety on your site. The majority is electronic music, which is fine but bitcoin is a niche currency and your site is a niche market.
I'd buy something if you had anything that interested me. There aren't even any descriptions of the albums or the artists, so I can't even be steered that way. I'd suggest you also get rid of the twitter bootstrap look and feel through customization and add some information about the items you are selling.

The "safety net" of government interference will be gone, but your life will be yours to do with as you please.
Twenty years from now we'll look back on a completely encrypted economy and internet and wonder how we ever lived without it. 
Revolutionary ideas such as Bitcoin and the internet are some of the most impressive and important notions ever devised. They will continue to enable privacy and self reliance in a world that seemed, for a while, to be heading in the opposite direction.

Storing your coins on Coinbase is the difference between having a 40 ton safe in your house with a 20 digit code (blockchain.info) and storing your coins at your mom's house in a tin lock box (Coinbase). 
If Coinbase ever got hacked, you're fucked. If Coinbase ever went offline for an extended period of time, you're fucked. If Coinbase ever decided to disappear off the face of the Earth with your bitcoins ala MyBitcoin, you're fucked.
NEVER STORE YOUR BITCOINS IN AN ONLINE WALLET WHERE YOU DO NOT CONTROL THE PRIVATE KEYS.
If any of the scenarios that I described were to happen at blockchain.info odds are your bitcoins would be protected by simply opening your backup in Multibit. With Coinbase there are no such backups, nor any level of assurance that your private keys and coins are secure.
All that said, Coinbase is a wonderful service to buy/sell coins, just don't keep them there longer than you have to.

Apple may not allow the blockchain app on iOS to be a wallet but it still functions as one after it connects to the blockchain servers. Piuk programmed some kind of switch in it that reinstates the full wallet capabilities even in the latest version despite what the release notes say.

This is exactly what bitcoin is supposed to be if it is to gain any prominence on the market at the international level. In order to be considered a currency that can compete and change anything you need a market cap of about $1 trillion (or less but for argument's sake). In order for that to happen each bitcoin, since there will only ever be $21 million must have a value of at least the lowest price that a bitcoin could ever have at a market cap is ~$50k each.
This has to happen at some point and I'm happy that I got in extremely early. This thing is nowhere near its peak. Jump on the train or jump off, because it's not stopping anytime soon.

When the US government decides they don't like bitcoin they have a single point of attack for 75% of the trading market. Mt. Gox was smart to get out of the USD market and put a patsy (Coinlab) in its place. When the government attacks the price will drop... for a while allowing those outside of the US to pick up cheap bitcoins. 
Those holding BTC from Coinlab in the United States will be put on lists and harassed by various three letter agencies.
The rest of the world will continue on treating the US as a radioactive site for BTC. You might even have two different prices one for a secret blackmarket exchange inside of the US which takes the risk of holding BTC in the US into account; and another USD market outside of the US which isn't worried about a government crackdown.
This whole situation is about to get even more interesting!

I really like Coinbase as a company. However controlling your own private keys in a secured format on a site with an open source and JS verifier is far more secure than on some company's website run by some nice guys with a pro interface.
I've been around the Bitcoin community since 2010 and there have been a lot of nice people come and go. Some fucked people over (MyBitcoin/Bitcoinica) and others got fucked over by their own ignorance(Bitfloor/Bitcoinica). The only way to make sure they don't get you when they go is to take trust out of the equation. Blockchain.info does that, Coinbase does not.
Storing your coins on Coinbase is the difference between having a 40 ton safe in your house with a 20 digit code (blockchain.info) and storing your coins at your mom's house in a tin lock box (Coinbase).

Thanks for the tip. I think you have a site with a nice backend (randomly generated addresses for each purchase and quick response) but you might want to change the name to open it up to new revenue streams. Calling it bittracks, not only limits you to music, it also limits you to bitcoin when there might be other crypto currencies that come to prominence in the future.
CoinDL.com is all but dead (hasn't been updated in forever) so there is a hole in the market that you can definitely take advantage of. Purchase and delivery of digital goods (ebooks, music, art, services, etc.) is something sorely lacking in the bitcoin world.

From 
Yifu had begun this process a year ago, as he was worried that if only one or two companies built ASICs, and they built too many of them for themselves, it would represent a threat to the Bitcoin network. What if those companies held all the chips and commanded 51% of the network? It was unlikely, but possible, and so Yifu set out to build ASICs of his own, knowing he could trust himself to get them into the hands of diverse customers. Decentralization, and all that.
While he knew he’d never be the first to market, at least he’d be protecting the network. As it turns out, Yifu’s competitors suffered delays, and a couple competitors dropped out of the market completely. Yifu eventually realized that Avalon would be the first brand of ASIC to actually hit the market, “I became the centralization that I set out to destroy,” he jokes.
He got into business simply to make the network not only more secure but also more distributed and he's getting paid handsomely for the trouble.

Yes if the bitcoins have been transferred out of bitcoin-24 and to a wallet that you control the private key for then there is nothing that a hacker of bitcoin-24 could do to access those coins at the new address that only you control.

Never store your coins on Coinbase.com 
You do not have access to the private keys for those addresses, if Coinbase were to ever go offline, disappear, get hacked, etc. you have absolutely no access to your coins. 
At the very minimum use blockchain.info/wallet as you can have an encrypted backup of your wallet sent to your email. If blockchain.info ever goes down you can always import those private keys into Multibit or other programs.
If you use blockchain make sure to use a strong password. 20+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers. Use a site like  to check your password strength.
Don't type your password into this site, type a password that is similar to yours. If you can't come up with a password that you can remember off the top of your head write a sentence that only you will remember. A lyric from a song, a line from a play, etc. then add numbers and symbols to that.
