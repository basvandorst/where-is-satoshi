Some GDAX customers have had wires to GDAX taking over a day recently. Why I don't know. Also GDAX charges $10 for a wire.

Wire transfer is the fastest way. Welcome to the world of banking and its stupendous slowness!
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:03:02
Are you saying that the balance in mycelium was zero, but you checked the mycelium public key against blockchain.info and there was a balance?
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:52:22
I stand corrected. You can do this as you ask in the OP. However, doing it the way I suggested will give you a better price for selling than Coinbase will.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:48:23
If your Coinbase account is linked to your bank then so is GDAX. They are one and the same!
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:26:30
After re-reading this reponse, I think you might be using a different (wrong) seed list. Check around for another seed word list that is actually for the ledger.
Good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:55:41
Currently you will get $14,529 per bitcoin using coinbase as opposed to $14,826 using GDAX.
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:54:49
Is your wallet encrypted? Do you have a mycelium password? What phone and phone OS are you using?
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:35:46
The way you suggest will not work. You can't send btc to a USD wallet on coinbase.
Here is what I would do:
Sell all your bitcoin for litecoin (just to move it faster and cheaper to Coinbase.)
Send the litecoin to GDAX.com (use the same login and password as you do for Coinbase.) Gdax is owned by coinbase and has fee free trading.
Once the litecoin arrives, sell them for USD on GDAX. 
Now you can transfer USD via GDAX to your bank.
Profit.  Just check that the litecoin and bitcoin prices on both exchanges are roughly the same. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:58:19
When you imported the seed into mycelium, did it show any balance (transactions?) Is it possible that you used a 25th word for a passphrase on your ledger?
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:48:09
When you select deposit choose wire transfer. Check the coinbase FAQ on transfer times. It is many days faster than ACH.

Doesn't matter much either way. This is because the futures are "cash settled" and for every long position, there must be an equal short position and vice-versa.

Once you sweep the paper wallet, is it then recoverable with the HD seed?

@_date: 2018-09-20 00:46:42
This is from your website and is completely impossible to accomplish before the explosion of our sun:

Can you give us some details on where you got the wrong address? It is possible if you give us more details about who owns that wallet and why you sent BTC there to begin with.
@_date: 2018-08-01 12:16:11

@_date: 2018-08-01 12:28:11

@_date: 2018-08-01 12:38:54
That sucks. Because it is gone then. Have you friend do a test and copy his address again, paste it and make sure it is the same after it is pasted. If it isn't, he has a virus. If it is the same, it is possible he is trying to bluff/steal or he doesn't know how to copy a bitcoin address. Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2018-08-01 12:24:52
What is that wrong address? Is it an old wallet you had, an exchange wallet, etc.?

Let me see if I understand you. 
Let's assume that all tethers have been sold for bitcoin to prop up the price. Tethers are found to be a complete fraud. Tether crashes. Bitcoin remains the same price because no one is selling bitcoin for tether. 
Your theory is that bitcoin tanks because there are no more tethers to prop up the price? If this is the case, then tethers are not being used to trade currently. This is wrong. People trade in and out of tethers to buy bitcoin low and sell it high. These people count their profits in tethers (dollars) gained and not bitcoin gained. Thus the need for more tethers.
 If tethers disappear, then traders will use another vehicle to trade. This could be one of the other altcoins including the new audited dollar pegged cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 18:48:37
Either you're trolling me (in which case, you can fuck off) or you have no grasp of what you are talking about.
If there are billions of dollars in tethers that people want to sell because no one wants them, then they buy bitcoin with them at market (which eventually will be approaching zero) if needed. If you can't sell them before they hit zero then you are screwed. 
However, many/most tethers will be successfully used to buy bitcoin. The price of which will rise significantly.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:16:08
Just take the value of 1 bitcoin (get that from an exchange) and multiply it by the bitcoin you have in your wallet. This will give you the value of the bitcoin you have. Yes, it is as easy as that!
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:49:19
What you are doing is a very good way to accumulate bitcoin. There is no magic way to get a bitcoin. You are buying with cost averaging and that is the best you can do. Only other option is to buy more each month.  Good luck!

Welcome. I would recommend that you take the time to read the links in the sidebar. 
But, your assumption is correct, you have to use real money (or real work) to buy or get paid in bitcoin. But, again, I highy recommend reading the bitcoin wiki (left side bar) before investing.

Bittrex wallet is currently offline. So, no you can't send btc to jaxx right now. I am not sure when they will begin allowing withdraws again. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:53:15
If bitcoin goes up in value on average $200 per month, it will take a long time to accumulate a bitcoin. If it goes up $300 a month, you will never get there at $250 a month.  [This seems logical at this time, but I could be wrong!]
Edit: This is not correct. See below.

I suggest you sell your BTC for something better! Then you won't have to fret over bitcoin being a niche market forever. Easy! Oh, and take a chill pill.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:39:22
I would recommend this:
1 Create new mycelium WALLET which will contain new private keys.
2 Send your BTC to the new mycelium wallet.
3 import your private key(s) from original mycelium wallet into a wallet supporting the new coin. 
This may be an overkill, but it is a safe way to do it.
Good Luck!

If tether fails, its holders try to sell it. If they could not get dollars for tethers they will sell tethers for bitcoin. Bitcoin would benefit and tethers would drop to zero as its holders fled to any other crypto.

Yes. However, you will not receive any BCH/BCC. It doesn't matter though. I doubt you could move it off of coinbase to a wallet that you own the private keys to or to an exchange that will credit BCH/BCC in time for the hardfork. 
Good Luck.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:47:57
Yea. Even will lots of inputs, you shoud be able to manually set a lower fee. Especially if it is not a priority transaction. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:09:21
Yes!  One will be the current BTC and the other wallet will be B2X or something.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:57:23
Good point HiTech...  
I think a wire transfer is $10, but quick! It might be a high fee, but longterm it will be cheaper. This is because on average in the past bitcoin has increased in % more than you saved in fees by waiting to buy at a higher price.
Sorry I know that is confusing.

Use this exchange (unless you prefer another) to exchange the coin for bitcoin.

It IS as simple as "Coinbase is crediting free B2X for already having BTC stored on their website during the fork"!!

@_date: 2017-11-06 18:17:56
Yea, you will get it, but you will have to export your private key to a different wallet and then follow instructions on how to split the coins to avoid replay attacks. 
If you are comfortable with that the you can keep them there. Personally, I would move them to a better wallet. If you send them to GDAX.com, they will be safely be split for you for free.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:08:52
Damn! You need to find a better state! ;)
Or, just keep the coins on coinbase and safely (with a fee) send them to your wallet after the fork.
good luck
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:57:42
Lower your fee before you send from wallet. If you can't,  you need a better wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:53:26
Sure. But, buyers will probably move to merchants where there are no such restrictions. This would cause the others to want to move where they have more liberty/freedom.

@_date: 2017-11-07 06:05:44
Anyone (even fast evil little bots) can replay the transaction on the other chain.
1,2,3 and 4 will not protect you. 
If you send someone BTC, they can replay your transaction and get your B2X too.

You are a hardcore bitcoiner! I like it. The file you need to backup is the wallet.dat file. It contains your private key(s).

@_date: 2017-11-05 18:33:08
With paperwallets you will receive all forking coins. Just be sure to split them before you spend any of them! This is due to the danger of a replay attack. However, if you don't do anything, your will be just fine!

It is possible that miners signalling 2X will not switch and continue to mine 1X.
I am not sure that double spending will be incentivized. 
Replay attacks are very concerning and users should split coins before spending.
Everthing else you state seems accurate to me.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:14:14
Set the price to one of the green numbers in the ever changing list you see there. Pick one near the top!  That is a limit order.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:48:16
Probably. The real question is can they enforce the ban.
The list of things banned in the west is staggering!

@_date: 2017-11-07 05:43:55
Several ways to do it. I am waiting until after the fork to find the best one that fits my situation. 
Can't split them now anyway so why pick a way yet?
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:25:23
A clean windows computer is short lived, IMO. There is no good way to ensure your computer is clean aside from reinstalling firmware on computer and then reinstall OS. That being said, run superantispyware on it and have an upto date antivirus. Then use mycelium wallet. This is my recommendation based on my knowledge.  Good luck!
You might want to put them on GDAX for fork. They will split the coins for you and you will have two wallets then. One with BTC and the other with B2X (or whatever it is called.)  
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:27:00

You will have to send a payment again for the next month. They can't debit more BTC from your wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:42:11
If you're wanting your private key from coinbase to get B2X coins, you do not need them. Coinbase will split the coins for you. 
If that is not the jist of what you are asking, I suggest that you check out this faq: 
Maybe watch some of these videos:  
I suggest you checkout those resources even if your question was answered.

Yes. However you should research this in orger to do it safely. (see replay protection.)

Tell them you will pay the credit card fees. Tell them that you are a minor and your country doesn't give much freedom to minors. They will understand and help you obtain them. If not, PM me (but, only after you try and fail to convince them).
Cheers 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:12:50
Oh. Looks like there might be a problem if they get data from GDAX. GDAX is splitting the fork into two coins one is bitcoin(BTC) and the other is somename(B2X). 
This is definitely going to be a problem as I doubt the prices will be the same.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:07:53
If you don't want to research, put your BTC on gdax.com. Leave them there until after fork.
Otherwise, just make sure you have your private key(s) and wait for splitting instructions after the fork. DO NOT spend either coin until you safely split them.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:08:52
Oh. I know how to make them anonymous. I was asking how you use/spend them and stay anonymous!

If you coded a new auto trading program that made you consistent profit, why would you give it/sell it to others?  It would be more profitable to keep it a secret and use it yourself.  I think this will eventually end badly. Just my opinion.

Are you sure that if you restore from seed, two factor will come with it?
Try restoring seed and see if you can access coins. Don't forget to reenable 2fa.

^ Do this. It is hard for wallets to provide fast transaction time and low fees in an easy format for users. When the network gets busy, the fees can skyrocket. But, if you are not in a hurry to get your BTC to its destination, you should use a lower custom fee. Especially if you are transfering a smallish amount of BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:18:37
Try removing/deleting the account/key from inside the electron wallet. Then close and reopen. It might make new account for you or you may have to add an account. Then try import again.

@_date: 2017-11-05 01:02:47
If you want fast and easy (online exchange risky?) use coinbase.
You will get the coins on your paper wallet though. It will just be a delicate process to get them split and safely on another wallet/exchange/etc.
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:41:58
No. I would avoid these type of businesses personally. Check and see what those redditors think.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:09:24
It won't change what you already have. It will add a new coin (sw2) to your account with the same balance as your current bitcoin. Just leave it there if you trust that coinbase won't be hacked or shutdown in the near term. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:32:31

The BTC would go to the B2X address, but on the BTC chain.
Whoever owns the B2X addy would be able to claim the BTC if they new it existed (they probably won't.)
If you sent it to a nice exchange, they will put it in the appropriate wallet if you ask them nicely and wait for a bunch of people that have the same problem. Because they want to  process them in batches.
Please correct me if i am wrong on this one.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:05:02
they are same. However, when you go to send your coins back to bittrex, coinbase will charge a fee and gdax will not. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:50:09
I have not seen any info on their plans about supporting segwit2x yet.
Will you ask them and let us know what they are doing?
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:27:33
Not sure I understand you correctly. But, you should probably wait to send your bitcoins from coinbase to a paper wallet after the fork. 
There are other solutions, but they are technical.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:07:38
Ok. Just beware of accidents.  Trip,  fall,  bump head and forget password.  It can happen.

You received 197 for the shapeshift transaction. The 39 is not yours. It is shapeshifts change address.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:27:05
Where did you get that TXid?
Are you saying that gatehub has not EVEN initiated (sent) the bitcoins to your coinbase wallet yet?
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:50:54
You are correct! 
Find a suitable wallet here: 
Then import your seed to the new wallet. Make sure balances are the same (older private keys may have to be imported seperately) and win!
A person "has" their wallet if they hold the word seed or private key(s). Make sure you are the only one that "has" the wallet too!  i.e. Delete your blockchain.info account after you have finished the import successfully. May not be able to delete, but you can make the password to that online account VERY strong.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:31:31
Same as with cash, except make sure it gets 1 confirmation before saying goodbye. Chat about bitcoin while you wait. You have something very special in common!
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:18:34
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:00:15
I would use mycelium instead then. They need not know your email.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:30:53
If you are backing up your private key(s) you should be ok. If it were me I would backup my seed phrase with it to!
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:57:22
It is my understanding that as more people start using segwit, the fees will continue to drop. I expect that fees will be much lower than "half" in short order.
We will just have to wait and see. I understand that a $2 fee is ridiculous to move any amount of digital currency.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:30:59
Yep. GDAX is the solution!  Use the same login as coinbase. Transfer coins from coinbase to GDAX (do this within GDAX website) then send BTC to her wallet fee free.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:41:21
You will have them either way!
Coinbase will probably be faster and definately easier.
Electrum : You will need to wait on instructions or an update from them to safely split the coins for you. If not, you risk losing them to a replay attack.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:21:08
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:57:14

Yes. But, it will take sometime to do that on most wallets. I think Mycelium might have a split update soon. CHECK IT OUT BEFORE YOU USE IT.  If you are not concerned about keeping coins on an exchange then I would use coinbase. If you plan on holding for a month then personal wallet is fine, IMHO.

Use GDAX.com for buying and selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:39:01
Fees are high right now. They should drop significantly in the next 3-6 months due to segwit. Also, lightning network may help lower fees too!
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:56:56
Use electrum to import the wallet.dat file. It doesn't require you to download the entire blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:07:10
You should not use a third party. It defeats the purpose of bitcoin. Make sure you have a P2P bitcoin payment method.

Duh! Sorry. After you get them to coinbase, move them to GDAX within GDAX website. it will let you send them back out with no fee.
Better yet, send them to GDAX to begin with.

Then Buy/send your BTC to gdax.com!  After the fork, both coins will be availble to you and be saffe to spend or trade.

Even then, this seems confusing to a beginner like me!
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:35:09
There will be tool/instruction to get them from your electrum wallet after the fork. So it is safe to keep them there. Just don't spend your BTC after the fork until you have used the tools/instructions to safely split your coins!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:21:46

Time of fork:
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:37:52
Many miners are greedy and try to only mine transactions with higher fees so they get to buy more expensive things. So, the transactions with the highest fees USUALLY get mined before the transactions with lower fees. Sometimes, an altrustic miner (who mines whatever it sees) will mine transactions with low fees or even no fee. 
It can be frustrating though if you are trying to send coins and they aren't coming through. In that case, it is best to user a higher fee for a quicker transaction.
Sorry for the wordy explaination and I probably missed something here. If you can help my understanding, it is welcomed!

A paper wallet is very safe until you have to load it onto a hot wallet to spend it. Also, you have to import/sweep the whole amount too.
A hardware wallet comes with a backup paper wallet (save from EMP attacks), plus you don't have to import to a hot wallet to spend.

Check here for info on what wallets to use:  
Wait until your wallet company or other tools come out with safe and specific information on how to split the forked coins. If you don't you will be subject to a replay attack that would result in a loss of coins. 
Edit: Removed Greenaddress as an option. It is their policy not to support hard forks!

I don't know man.. cutting it close. I would probably use localbitcoins. Get signed up and ready right now. GDAX might work if you do a bank wire. Be sure to have your account setup ASAP though.
Probably other ways too. redditors?

Try sending it with a very low fee like 1% of what you are going to send. It will probably get picked up within a week. If not, it will eventually come back to you. 
It is some math, with some guessing and even luck! That is how you solve the questions. It is that way by design. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:19:33
They are charging a premium for the convenience. That is a steep premium. As the price goes up a small % premium goes up too much. The ATM owner needs to adjust his fee % as the price rises. IMO
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:01:47
Replay attack are dangerous for users of either chain. BTC or B2X.  A replay attack can only happen after (evil bot very shortly after) you send either BTC or B2X. The other coin you didn't send becomes vulnerable to the attack.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:25:55
Are you sure he can still see his balance on the coinbase app?  Looks like the coins were sent to another address. Hopefully, an address he owns the key to.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:31:13
^ Do this.  No need to wait a month though. After the forked coins are in your new coinbase wallet, you are safe to send either coin.
and chill. ;)

If you fiddled around with that client you may have other *.dat files in same directory as wallet.dat that contain private key(s) as well. Back them all up!
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:50:54
No. But they will create a new wallet for you that contain forked coins (it will contain the same amount of coins you have in your BTC wallet). Probably called B2X or something. No one is sure what the value of the coins will be, but it won't be $7000 any time soon!  Actually, I think they are valued somewhere around $1500 at this time.

@_date: 2017-11-06 23:14:06
This is correct!
Also, if your wallet gives you access to your private keys, you will be able to manually split the coins after the fork. Don't spend anything until you split the coins or you will be in danger of a replay attack. Wait until after the fork for the best tools/instruction on splitting your coins safely.
If you don't have access to your private key(s), you better hope your wallet company has a plan or move the BTC to a better wallet!!!

@_date: 2017-11-05 22:28:59
if you don't split them both coins are vunerable to the replay attack. It just depends on which one you send. Because the other one you will lose.
If you do split them (using a guide/tool that wil come out soon after the fork) then they both will be safe and you can send and receive both coins safely!
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:32:02

They have the ability to resolve this. I doubt that it was sent to a tether address. It was most likely sent to a BCH address. I will probably take some time (days) for them to recover them for you. Maybe not though. I had this same issue with some other coins a while back. It took them weeks to help me.
Is it possible that the coin you sent just hasn't been confirmed on the blockchain yet?
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:09:06
Yes. You will get them on a paperwallet for sure!  You will just need to wait until a good splitting tool gets released to split the coins. Probably within a week of the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:43:42

You can ask, but nobody knows. It is my opinion that in the long term this will not be seen as a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:15:26
Yes. That is basically correct. In this fork, the main coin (BTC) will continue as it has been. The forking coin will create a new name (B2X?) and run on a new blockchain. But, you keep your BTC and get the other coin for free essentially.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:53:31
1 that is what it is mostly everywhere right now but adoption is coming quickly it seems.
2. That just means they will only allow Indians to buy  from them. However, the bitcoin they are selling is the same bitcoin that the rest of the world is using!!
3 Electrum can easily transfer to any other wallet. Even Indian ones.
4 that sucks. Sometimes you have to lose liberty to gain liberty!
5 Ask Zebpay about fork. You might be better off waiting until after the fork to buy for safely and since you are unsure.

Lots of good points and questions!
I am not sure if I understand exactly what you are saying though. So, I can't really upvote this. 
I would definitely make you have access to your private key(s) though and wait until after the fork for instructions on how to safely split them so you don't lose them!
I would also make sure if you have any BTC on an exchange you make sure they are doing something safe with your coins! 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:47:02
Are your BTC already on GDAX? If so, just leave them there until after fork. gdax will create a new wallet for you with the B2X coins in it on the GDAX site.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:03:13
And you help more transactions get into each block.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:04:08
If you had a strong password and google authenticator, you most likely have a comprimised email account. Do you use that "strong" password anywhere else? The reason I believe your email was compromised is because they would have had to had access to your authenticator credentials to login.
I would change every password you have into a PASSPHRASE! 
Turn off 2fa on sites that use google authenticator. 
Recreate a new authenticator seed
reenable 2fa on all sites again with new authenticator seed.
If you are concers about hacking while you have the 2fa off on the sites you use, use sms 2fa temporarily.
I would also check your computer for malware. You could have a keylogger and/or a screenviewer type malware.
Good luck.

I think BTC will be just fine. However, it is important to understand the risks associated with this attack.
Do you think people will lose BTC or B2X due to replay attacks? I wonder what it will do to their psyche.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:34:34
I would agree with you. It would only become a concern if the wallet was discontinued.

 You are approaching spreading FUD here. Some users will always be fooled. Fooled into buying BCC thinking it was BCH or even BTC. But, this will not do a damn thing to BTC. Your other attacks have been tried. 
Let me be clear on one point. If bitcoin has a weakness, it will be found and exploited. BTC could become a failed experiment. More likely, BTC will push a softfork fix like segwit. Because scaling is a threat. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:37:58
Yes. Just login to coinbase's trading site gdax.com with your coinbase login. Then move your bitcoins (from within gdax website) from coinbase wallet to gdax wallet.

From their blog:
We have supported segwit in our testnet environment for a long time now, and with segwit locked in on the main chain, we have deployed the changes needed to enable this to the main service. When you next log in to your wallet you will be upgraded to segwit and offered the chance to opt-out. If you don’t see the upgrade prompt, your client is too old and you will need to update it. Once segwit is enabled on your account and you have generated at least one receive address, it will be locked in and you will no longer be able to disable it.
Segwit is fully backwards compatible with the rest of the ecosystem, you should notice no differences with segwit enabled except cheaper fees.
Our testing shows that segwit fees are around half the cost of the equivalent non-segwit transaction. Lower fees kick in once you start spending segwit inputs, so for most users it will take a few transactions before you see the full effects. As the rest of the ecosystem updates we expect block pressure to reduce which may also lower fees further.
We strongly recommend that all users upgrade their wallet apps to the latest available versions to pick up recent updates and fixes and to ensure your transaction fees are as low as possible. Also we suggest that users get into the habit of checking their fees before sending transactions. When fees are high you can often save money by delaying transactions to quieter times like late at night and the weekend.

The bad thing about these paper wallets is that you might have malware on your devices. i.e. phone, computer, printer, router, etc. 
If that malware sees you printing wallets they might keep a copy for themselves. They could then steal any BTC you put on them. 
Please research safely using paper wallets and follow the instructions. If you find some good instructions. Post them here. They will get checked and if they are good, other prople can use them too.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:47:33
Yes, this is very confusing!
Take the time to research this.  if you want you could send your BTC to coinbase and they will split and credit you with an equal amount of B2X.  Also, don't send either coin from a personal wallet until you can safely split them. See Replay attack.

SPV nodes typically use 4 connection slots, and full nodes typically use 8. 
You will need to figure out how to change these defaults.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:59:02
Yes! Move it to GDAX.com ASAP. This is my opinion. After fork, consider a hardware wallet.
Do some reading, you will be glad you did:

It is SegWit1X not to be confused with the upcoming SegWit2X fork!  You are on the right chain too.

I believe you are mistaken. When the b2x arrives in new coinbase wallet, they will have already been safely split. This protects them from the replay attack. 
You will be about to freely spend and send both BTC and B2X
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:24:46
Damn dude. That is a conundrum! Do you have any friends that could sign up and then sell the BTC direcly to you.  Face to face purchasing is what I would try.
Good luck!

^ This!
Gdax just has free sending fees. You use the same login and password for both sites.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:39:25
Bank transfer fees to/from gdax are free. However, they take4-6 days. In that time, bitcoin can be much higher by the time your funds arrive. 
So, you could save some % in fees but lose a larger % because of the delay. The opposite is also true.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:03:41
Yes. It wouldn't effect that!
The reason I asked is that if you ever typed your email password on any device that had a keylogger installed someone could login to your email. They could request changes and then delete the emails. There are some other attacks too. To avoid that I would change your email password ASAP and turn on 2fa too.
Are you sure you are typing the password correctly?
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:47:10
That is a good question. You will be able to open an account and verify enough for limited transfer values. 
If I were you, I would signup on multiple exchanges to be sure I could buy it and more of it.
localbitcoins allows you to find someone near you that you meet at a bank or police office to exchange cash for bitcoins. use a reputable seller.
Good luck. Sorry I don't have any better info.

It would be a fork similar to segwit1x. backwards compatible, but if you want paid you better run a wallet that accepts mini-satoshis or I will shop with someone who does.

^ This.
Also, If your coins are on coinbase (or better yet GDAX) on :  , Then you will receive the new Segwit2x coin automagically in a new wallet. The balance of the new coin will be exactly the balance of your BTC at the time of the fork.

It is probably a false positive. However, I would consider yourself compromised. Backup your wallet file.

Nice write up!  Bitcoin should survive this attack. If it loses to B2X or BCH, then they will have to prevent that chain from a similar or better attack in the near future. May the best coin win.  Go Bitcoin!

@_date: 2017-11-06 05:52:03
I love it. It was a great learning experience about forks. But, I doubt it will replace BTC. It scares me a bit how fast they are ramming changes into it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:00:36
GDAX/Coinbase is only exchange that i know will split your coins for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:32:17
I don't know! I doubt anyone really knows. It would be bad if you sold it asap and then it gained value and overtook BTC. I doubt this will happen, but it is possible. IMO, it is best to hold both until it becomes clear who is mining what and where the money goes.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:02:35
People who fear bitcoin, will try to attack it everyway possible. This is a fact. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:34:59


I don't think that is how it works.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:12:34
Beware of cognitive dissonance. I agree that I hope and think BTC will survive this fork just fine. But, if a shitcoin is more profitable to mine, miners are going to mine it. I prefer BTC over all these forks so far.

@_date: 2017-11-04 04:32:12
Doesn't matter what wallet you send from. When there is a backlog of transactions, lower fee transactions just take time. Sometimes a nervous amount of time. You could send it with a higher fee, but since it is $10 you would lose a large percentage of your coins and it would not be worth it. The backlog usually clears up in a couple days. Maybe wait, check the backlog before sending to your bread wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:56:08
I don't know, but many of the people that bought the b2x futures have guns in their mouths right now and are debating on whether to pull the trigger or not.

Wait for good instructions on how to do this AFTER the fork happens.  If you are not VERY careful, you will probably lose coins.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:49:35
If it is in coinbase, I would leave it there until after the fork. They will split the coins for you to protect you from replay attacks.
Then I would go with a hardware wallet. You can probably do HW wallet right now too. The HW wallet companies will almost definately release an update for splitting the coins.

Lower the fee manually to something like 1-5 dollars total (not per/byte). Send small transaction. It may take a while to confirm, but it will. If it doesn't you will get it back.

It is legit. Sign up, get verified and find a reputable seller that is close to you. Meet them in a safe public place and trade BTC for cash. You can also do it via escrow online, but I doubt it will be fast enough for you.

If you are not sure, then store them on the  exchange. They are owned by coinbase so if you have a coinbase account, you can use the same login info for both.

If, after the fork, bitcoin can reach 1024 blocks and get a difficulty adjustment, it will win. If B2X has enough hash power and consistently attacks BTC by adding and remove hash power, bitcoin will have to change its difficulty adjustment code (hardfork). 
This is only if this is a coordinated attack. If hashing follows the market, like it naturally should, B2X will fail.
There are many other things that could happen here, but i think this is the one that will matter most.

We would need more people (entities) that want them. Since the earth doesn't have enough people, these "people (entities)" would have to come into bitcoin from another galaxy.  As long as we can transmit blocks via quantum signaling, the distance will not be a problem. Bitcoin really is a universal currency.

Recommended fees change constantly. Right now they are quite high due to a backlog of transactions in the blockchain. There are times when the fees are really low. You could (i have) send the bitcoin when the backlog (mempool) is empty, with zero fees. Either way a LARGE fee right now is like 3 dollars for a transaction.
EDIT: left out important point.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:37:57
This is not true. The transaction is only signed on the ledgernano s. To send it, you verify the address on the Nano's screen. If it is correct then you press buttons on nano to broadcast signed transaction.

They aren't against scaling. They want a solution that doesn't require an increase in blocksize everytime the blockchain needs scaled up (monthly/yearly). They are smart in that they want to do scaling once. Segwit 1x solved this because it allows for lightning networks and sidechains. It is a slower way to start scaling, but way better for the future of BTC IMO.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:55:57
Yes. But anyone can do that at anytime even I can split from the chain for a test or a concern I may have with the main chain. It is going to happen whether we like it or not.
I choose my poison. I think a contentious hardfork that Sw2x is planning on doing is poor design. They have been told that. They could put in replay protection for us non-believers, but they want a fight. A fight they knew would come. Let the fight begin!
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:04:22
Remember, BTC is valuable (and mined) because it is immutable and has had a 100% accuracy and success rate for 9 years. If another coin replaces it, it better be decentralized or people will not trust it. BTC is very trustworthy.

Mining is almost always a losing proposition. You are better off spending your money on buying bitcoin.
However, if you want better into, check here: @_date: 2017-11-04 18:19:32
BCH has larger block sizes and can handle more transaction volume than BTC.
However, BTC has way more hash power behind it. (Think Secure)
The markets will determine which coin is better and right now it is saying BTC is more valuable. 
Currently, it is much more difficult for businesses to accept BCH than BTC. 
BTH may have bigger blocks, but eventually (if it is used heavily like BTC) it will need even bigger blocks. So, it is kind of kicking the can down the road.
BTC has segwit and sidechain support now. Thus, we will likely see lower fees and other value add systems on it. BCH doesn't have this.

You will get them. You will have to wait for Trezor to provide instructions on how to split them so you can use them. This could take sometime after the fork.

Looks like they won't.  You could put coins on GDAX.com during the fork.

It is common practice for USA citizens to not have much liberty with money. If possible, move to a location where you have liberty.
That said, It is very common and has been safe so far for them to give this information. Their money and bitcoins are even protected by FDIC insurance. Not sure how good that insurance is though!

It depends on your device or if it is an online wallet.  Check them out here. Pick one that suits you. 
While your choosing a wallet, (you obviously have electrum and that is ok), you might consider sending them to gdax.com to take advantage of free safe coin splitting for the upcoming fork! But, you will be able to do it from electrum after the fork too. It might be complicated though.

Then you split the coins. However, you should take great care in doing this as B2X has no replay protection. This starts to get technical. However, there will be guides, tools and wallets that will safely do this for you just like it was done for BCC/BCH
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:15:20
You can't just wait 3 weeks and then safely spend them! They must be split first!

Yes. Not sure which exchange(s) though. Last I heard it was trading around $1500

Looks to me it is still in the mempool.  
Maybe your wallet is not behaving correctly?  reboot and reload wallet software.

Only your B2X coins would be in danger of being replay on the B2X chain. resulting in the lost of your B2X coins. If you don't care about them you can just ignore it. 
However, B2X coins will have some value :
If you want to claim those coins, you will have to run a replay protection splitting tool/instructions before you send any B2X coins. If you don't the corresponding BTC coins can be replayed on the legacy BTC network.

You should be able to find someone to sell you less than a whole bitcoin. Just ask them what their limits are.

Most professional investors dollar cost average. That means, buy 50 each paycheck!  I think this is sound advice. However, if you see bitcoin drop, some people like to try and buy a little when it starts going back up. This is risky though.
Good luck and welcome to Bitcoin.

Don't worry. Have patience.

Those that allow you access to your private key(s) or plan to implement update/tool/instructions on safely splitting the coins to avoid replay attacks.
If you find a good one, let me know.
Here is a list of wallets that have posted information about this fork that I know about:
* [BitGo](
* [Blockchain.info](
* [BlockCypher](
* [Bread](
* [CoinJar](
* [Electrum](
* [Exodus](
* [GreenAddress - Basic stance on hardforks is unsupported](

If you find one that is open source, let me know. Not sure I would trust a ticker widget otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:00:48
Will you ask them what their stance is on the SegWit2x fork is? 
Please let me know if you find out!
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:38:44
Did you have 2 factor authentication turned on?
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:32:39
This is not current, but this seems to be a trend. No one knows what in the hell to do. I suspect that the major exchanges will do as coiinbase is doing. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:16:36
You are right. You will be able to get the coins off blockchain.info too. However, it will take some effort. You will have to follow the instructions of manually splitting your coins for safety!
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:03:35
I will probably use 
But, I will spend my time choosing when we get closer.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:11:53
Use segwit and use custom fee of 50 cents. It will go through, but it will likely take a while.

For the uninitiated or for those who are still working on their reasoning skills (I am not judging, we all have been there!), this guy in the video may be a really nice guy, but he needs to update the firmware on the logic chip in his head. 
I think he really believes it, so I won't bash him too much. However, if you think he makes sense and understands what he is talking about. You should study up a bit on logic because what he is saying is complete BULLSHIT!
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:41:55
I would think they would list them on their website.
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:15:24
Just wait. There is a backlog of transactions and those with highest fees are confirmed first. Patience.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:37:22
No. You traded LTC to BTC correct? How much LTC did you send to shapeshift? Please let us know the exchange rate for BTC at the time you sent it.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:57:30
It is an exchange in so much as you can exchange one coin for another with a very low fee and at a good rate.  
Correct. They don't require KYC (although, they keep records of your transaction in case there is a problem with a transaction. Not sure how long they keep records, etc.  There is another similar exchange that I can't think of right now, that does the same.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:05:07
Oh. Sorry, I misunderstood you.  You could create an account then with minimal verification. If you have a low limit, you would just do some each day until you had all your coins out of GDAX.  GDAX has no transaction fees for sending BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:56:51
Yes. You will have to have an adult (parent,uncle, etc.) set up an exchange account and them have them buy bitcoin. You will then pay them for the bitcoin and they will send it to your wallet. You know own bitcoin. 
But first, you need to understand the basics. Read about them here: 
Also, if you like youtube videos, watch these videos: 
Good luck, welcome and HODL. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:25:26
It is safe to hold, spending will be the danger. Just wait until after the fork and use a well (yet too be) vetted tool/method to split your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:25:32
Really?  BTC has replay protection. It doesn't matter though. Both coins need replay protection for it to be secure.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:24:22
Check out bittrex. If they will be running during fork, you can buy tether (USD) and then get it to your bank or where ever later.
Good luck.

This is a time waster! Do not participate.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:39:24
If, after the fork, you send your BTC, you will probably lose your B2X coins! You may want to sell them instead of losing them. If so, you will need to split them!
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:47:22
Gemini is an exchange. Gemini will create a wallet for you to use (they actually hold the keys, so you have to trust them!) 
To learn more about wallets, check out this FAQ:

You made a cross-chain spend. If you swept your bch private address using sweepkey, which it looks like you did on blockchain.info.
Then all you need to do is wait and relax!  It will show up in one of your wallets and the other (31?) transactions will be rejected.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:47:11
Since you're fairly new, keep the coins on coinbase. Unless you want to do some research and you hold your own private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:33:29
I think Bread wallet has a sync option somewhere. Try that. Also, reboot phone.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:58:04
Take the receiving address and search for it at blockchain.info. You should find a transaction from your send addy to the receive addy. Check if it is confirmed or unconfirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:53:48
You could exchange it for say litecoin (insert any semi stable alt coin here). 
Maybe use changelly.com or shapeshift.io
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:30:44
Users need to learn to protect their systems and practice good security until copy/pasting of Addresses is no longer necessary.

Yep. You are correct. We will need bridges for oversea gaps, Wifi bridging routers for longer distances. guerilla run cell towers.  Ok. I will stop with the nonsense now.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:17:41
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:42:51
Good point. However, I would guess that coinbase will let users know which coin is what. As for users buying the cheaper coin, yes that will probably happen. But users, will be users and users make mistakes!
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:17:35
Oh. Thanks for the info!  I didn't give it a second thought, because of current barrier to entry/exit problems. It is tough in the beginning. But, I agree with you 100%. 
Hey ,  you should use direct peer-to-peer payments!  I know you coinbase is easy, but the easy way is not usually the best way! Please at least provide for the use of direct peer-to-peer option. Give a discount if people use it. By using coinbase (bank) you are defeating the purpose of bitcoin itself. You don't want to do that. 
Shit, just noticed simplysunshades uses coinbase as intermediary too. They make it so easy for people. This is going to be a problem for a while.  Hey please see above. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:03:03
I have no idea about price. I believe long term it is up. This is just based on my knowledge though. It might be smart to buy half now and then buy more later. You might catch a dip and you might not. This is dollar cost averaging though and is a reasonable investment strategy.
Good Luck!
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:48:23

I should have said Wallet ID instead of identifier.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:06:17
Yes. They specifically said they would not split BCH coins unless and until such time they are legitimate. I think the BCH coins (for coinbase users) are coming in next few months. However, for this coming split, they will split and issue you them right away. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:18:48
Unfortunately, for kids, there is no good option other than buy face to face from someone. 
Hey, you are someone that could sell them to her. Don't forget to take a small percentage for a fee.  ;)

You will get the BTC. However, It is possible that you could get both if the timing was by luck just right.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:15:25
^ This. 
Keep your coins on coinbase app until after the fork and just relax!
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:57:22
True. I would keep both coins or sell them both to cash. I wouldn't sell one for the other right away. This is just my opinion!!!
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:27:53
^ This. No Fees!
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:45:05
True! I hope that bitcoin adoption slows. It is not ready for public currency adoption yet!
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:33:29
I would not keep BTC on that exchange. You may not receive forked B2X coins that should arrive on  . Make sure you have your private key. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:46:23
Oh. My bad! I don't know.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:09:17
Use coinbases trading platform GDAX.com for transactions. They are free. You can use your coinbase username and password to login to GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:07:23
Which fork will the exchange follow or will it split the sexwit2x coins safely for you?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:29:08
By "just wait", I mean that it will probably go through before it gets returned.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:52:27
keep in electrum for access to new B2X coins in a week or month probably.  Move them to coinbase if you want coinbase to split them for you.  Either way you will get the fork coins.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:25:26
Me too if we are talking about less than $25.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:08:22
Will you please ask them what their stance is on segwit2x and replay attacks?
Please let me know what they say.  Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:30:18
Under the "From" pull down menu, do you see other accounts with balances?
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:12:55
True. It is a new chain that includes segwit and a blocksize increase to 2MB. This is all well and good, except it has NO REPLAY PROTECTION!
Mant non tech savvy users will lose coins if they transfer them after the fork. The coins must be split before moving either. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:17:41
You can buy during the fork (I doubt you will find an open exchange). But it is safe. If you get really lucky and buy just as the fork starts and you might end up with both coins.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:35:10
1. GDAX is where you should transfer to.
2. I don't think so. I think that option is only available on coinbase and you pay a premium for it. However, if you pay 5% premium and get them at that locked in price. It might be better than if you wait 4 days while the BTC price has gone up 10%.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:10:44
I agree that is a likely scenerio.  What if it went to 1 block per day? 
I am saying this is an attack on BTC. It is possible it could succeed.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:17:14
If this would work, then it will be tried. Let me know when it starts, so I can watch what happens.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:14:28
I am not wishing for this. I don't think it will happen. It is possible and I am just stating that fact. You are correct segwit2x could become BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:48:14
Maybe, but will you trade them for BTC or B2X?
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:41:34
It is crazy, but I don't think they have made any statements on how they will protect users from a replay attack. 
I did just ask them. We will see how quickly they respond.

If you move your BTC wallet there now, your B2X will already be on the exchange when it comes back up for trading!
Faster profit!  I don't recommend selling B2X coins ASAP though. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:57:08
That is NOT true!
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:29:49
Are you trolling me?  The vandalism would only be to the secret chain. It would be similar to vandalizing a rock out in the middle of a corn field. No one would see it. A secret coin can't steal any bitcoins.

@_date: 2017-11-17 01:47:14
If BTC is rising, it can be more profitable to buy via coinbase with a bank transfer (pay premium and fees) than waiting for funds to arrive via [inset other method]. By then the price of BTC is up way more. This is has been the long term trend and I expect it to continue.

Thanks. Are you affiliated with bread? I would hate to provide this information to other if it was unofficial.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:13:45
True. However, you only risk losing (to a replay attack) the coins on the chain that you did NOT move. If you move BTC, those coins are safe. What is not safe are your secret coins on the other blockchain that can be sent to the same address (again on the secret chain) that you sent the BTC to. But it doesn't matter, because you don't care if some steals your secret chain coins!
This is confusing for sure. Do you follow me?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:44:54

@_date: 2017-11-05 22:50:24
You probably bank at a small private bank or a credit union then.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:53:22
Whoa!!!  You are wrong on question 1.
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:37:31
You will have bitcoin(BTC). You will not get the B2X coin that is related to the fork. You will not be at risk of losing your BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-05 02:46:23
Yes. limited supply. Forks create new coins and thus new blockchains (i.e. not bitcoin) out of thin air. kind of like free coins.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:04:56
It is probably safe, but it sucks.
Other options are localbitcoins or find an exchange that doesn't have KYC requirements. i.e. an exchange outside US for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:00:14
Leave your coins on Coinbase. They will credit you with an identical amount of S2X coins on this date: 
So, you can relax and do some research on your own about it.

It is a lot of data!! Did you reach your ISP bandwidth limit for the month?
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:38:23
^ this
It may take a while, but there will be several ways to split coins within days after the split.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:01:32
If this happens, BTC will be a failed experiment and a different coin will take its place. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:02:43
You should probably put your BTC in GDAX if you want to be sure you get the forked coins.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:03:10
Same as you would do with any other wallet if the internet was down.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:10:17
Yea, The wallet ID would have been sent to his email address. Search his mail for it. Maybe he printed it or wrote it down?

If you do it via GDAX, it is also free.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:41:25
Try this:

This would be true of all alt coin then right?

@_date: 2017-11-05 20:53:58
They have a good history of providing forked coins for you automagically. However, they have not released any info on this fork!
You might want to find another exchange (gdax.com) to store your coins on during the fork. They claim support of the forked coin and will split them to a new wallet for you. Other exchanges are doing this too. I am not sure which ones though.
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:01:52
Someone will try to scam you!
Before you reply to anyone that  contacts you, talk to Dave at HTTPs://walletrecoveryservices.com
That said, answer the questions these people here have asked you, they can probably help you quicker!
Good luck. If someone IMs or emails you, you can be pretty sure they are trying to help you so they can steal your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:58:23
They will be on a different blockchain, but you will have the same private key on the new B2X chain as you do on the current BTC chain. you should not move either coin until you manually split them. If you want to avoid this technical mojo then send them to GDAX for the fork! 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:55:05
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:17:30
Research why it is better to use GDAX than Coinbase for buying, selling and trading bitcoin. 
Hint: It is much cheaper, the same company and used the same login credentials that you use for coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:37:07
Both GDAX and Coinbase will give you the coins all split up and ready to spend!
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:30:00
Yes. Just make sure you follow a guide on how to split forked coins. 
Use  to sell Alts for BTC.

It will probably get worse before it gets better!
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:58:59
Yep. This is an attack on bitcoin. We will see if it survives. I am betting it will. It will definitely be interesting.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:28:17
There are no fees to export a private key(s) from one wallet to another. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:07:33
Leave them there until after the fork. If you do, coinbase will create a new wallet for the forking coin and give you the same value you have in BTC of the new coin at the time of the fork. 
I don't condone keeping coins on an exchange, but this is an unique exception.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:32:12
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:08:18
Looks good. USDT would be faster to get out of BTC. Plus you could get into another coin if its market was growing.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:04:02
This is correct, IF you withdraw.
I am not sure if this is the worth recommending to bitcoin users like me that are not as tech savy!  It can be confusing.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:39:42
Yes. Thanks for making sure I was aware of this. I am looking for official info from armory on how they recommend their users reconcile the replay attack problem. I am making a list of these official announcments.  If you run across any, let me know. Here is what I have found so far:
* [BitGo](
* [Blockchain.info](
* [BlockCypher](
* [Bread](
* [CoinJar](
* [Electrum](
* [Exodus](
* [GreenAddress - Basic stance on hardforks is unsupported](
* [Ledger](
* [Trezor](
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:50:15
Your best option is to have and adult friend (mother, father, aunt or uncle, etc.) sign up at an exchange and buy bitoins. Then, you buy those same bitcoins from them. Keep them on a phone wallet or better yet a paper or hardware wallet.
Cheers and welcome!!
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:08:51
yes. but it is reckless to not include replay protection. I would say it is an attack even.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:24:28
You can't mess up splitting the BCH as it has strong replay protection built in.
Back to your question, I am agnostic on exchanges (for the most part), but coinbase seems to be the only one that offers a very simple solution to a complexish problem(at this time).
I would read their FAQ for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:27:40
Higher price and fees!
Next time use GDAX.com Coinbase owns it so you can use your coinbase username and password there.
Better luck next time!
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:53:52
You are a smart cookie if you do this!
Make sure to never connect it to the network!!!!!
Use a wallet that allows you to sign bitcoin transations on the offline cold storage laptop. The you take that signed transaction and broadcast it on another device that is connected. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:15:38
Sweet! Old school style. Just keep a backup of your wallet.dat file or your private key(s).

WHAT? This is not good advise.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:49:09
Yes, it should be clear which coin you are buying on an exchange.
Bitcoin will be BTC
Bitcoin 2x will be B2X or something.
You will be able to verify this by the price probably. BTC will be the one that is higher (just my opinion!!!).  ;)
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:01:03
I stand corrected. Neither has replay protection against the other. 
Optional Replay Protection is not Replay Protection. 
However, a secret blockchain could not steal any BTC via a replay attack.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:04:40
Go to Japan and look up Mark karples(sp). Ask him for your money back. He got millions from the settlement from a legal loophole.  You may have to wait in line. I suspect many people will be waiting to talk to him about their BTC too!
On a more serious note, NOPE!
I am sorry for your loss though. I had a friend that also lost from it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:45:46
Are you kidding me? Who was the aggressive attacker?
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:43:20
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:48:53
Just keep your private keys safe. You will have both coins with the same private key after fork. Don't' send either coin until you split them safely. 
Move your BTC to coinbase and they will split them for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:20:35
See if this helps:
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:10:05
I assume you mean B2X should add replay protection as Bitcoin Core/segwit1 has it.
Secret fork attack is not possible.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:10:16
Saving face whilst giving up.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:29:09
is it correct that all you need for a fork is 1 miner and 1 node?
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:00:12
Oh. Check to make sure you can export your private key(s). If you can, rest assured that there will be tools and instructions to help you split them safely after the fork happens. You must split them or you risk losing them to a replay attack.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:59:55
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:31:13

@_date: 2017-11-08 04:47:21
^ This.  Just to be clear, for number 2, leave your bitcoin on coinbase during the fork. They will automagically credit your account wuth a new wallet that contains your share of these coins. The are doing the SAFELY and for free!
Welcome to the frontier!

Why do silica packet exist?
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:43:33
Yep. This is a possibility. If natural market forces work, I don't see this working. But, if they move hash and keep it there regardless of profitability, then BTC has a problem.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:52:01
You will have the coin on both chains and I don't think you would even have to worry about the replay attack problem.  Yea. I think so.
Let me know if i am wrong. Blockchain logic is hard for me! 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:11:41
1) No one knows.
2) GDAX,com if you want the free forked coins nicely split for you into two seperate wallet. Paper wallet is safe, but it will take some time and effort to split the coins safely.
3) If you get lucky right away. But, probably days or weeks. Especially right now with a large backlog of transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:18:46
Won't know until it happens. Miners signaling may not switch.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:13:28
Good point!
But, then B2X would have to be better somehow. Otherwise, someone will do the exact same attack on them in the near future. Essentially taking control away from the B2X !
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:18:22
It is risky in that you won't hold your private keys for a while. It is risky to put your coins on any exchange. 
However Coinbase/GDAX.com are insured.  
Use gdax instead of coinbase for the fee free transactions. You can use the same login username and password as they are the same company.
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:57:51
I would be VERY cautious of this! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:26:45

@_date: 2017-11-08 03:29:42
So you better be a good chart reader before you try this.  I don't understand charts much. I think I will stay away. For me it would just be gambling.
Oh well. Thanks for the information!
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:34:10
Only bad in the sense that you will have to wait for your hardware wallet company to provide an update or tool to split the coins. You could always do it manually, but you will want a good guide and some tech savvy. Either way, you still get the coins. If you keep them on coinbase during the fork they will do all this splitting for you. There are probably other exchanges that will do this also. I don't know. 
Also, i recommend you move them because blockchain.info wallets are private wallets, but it is a wacky implementation. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:00:11
It is complicated. You can research it  if you like. If you want to buy bitcoin and not worry at all about fork, then buy it using gdax.com
Leave coins there until after fork.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:28:13
Yea. Many people swear by electrum. I can't believe they ask for your email though. Go check their subreddit and find out why.  Also, find out why it freezes there.
Good luck
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:16:49
You should move your BTC to a wallet that gives you access to your private key(s). You can also move your coins to a gdax.com account and they will issue you the new coins after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:45:37
Anyone can fork bitcoin anytime!  The problem is convincing people that your fork is better. Miners will only mine a fork that has value. 
Just ignore. Better yet, fork bitcoin yourself and start a blockchain amongst your friends! It will be a little bitcoin community that you all can use for bets, buying beer, etc. But, most importantly, you will learn a lot!
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:10:42

It is highly likely that you will be just fine doing what you doing. Just make sure that you are a good form of encryption and one that is open source. 
There is a small chance you will have some great difficulty accessing your private key in the long term (years.)
If I were you, I would also have my word list or private key on a paper wallet in a very secure location.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:35:31
Yea. It is surprising that miners would want a contentious hardfork that could result in a loss of value in bitcoin. It seems like something someone who didn't like bitcoin (or was afraid of it) would do.

Thanks for correcting me! So, it would (if nasty quick bot) hurt the person you buy the B2X from. How will they protect their self? If they used your method, how would the next one protect their self?
Interesting. I am not sure if this would be a good fit for my sense of morality. Just my opinion though.

@_date: 2017-11-05 16:43:44
You didn't answer my question.  Only transactions made on the secret chain could be replayed on the BTC chain. No one would make transations on secret chain because it is secret.
Transactions made on main BTC chain could be replayed on the secret chain, but who cares? It is secret and the coins there have no value. 
Do you agree?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:26:10

I believe that B2X is an irresponsible attack on bitcoin because they did not implement good replay protection.
That said, I plan to hold both until I get a better understanding of what is going on. I only have just over $500 of bitcoin though. Not sure what I would do if i had more.
Good luck

Bittrex was up for the BCH split. However, you could not send or receive BCH for hours because of the slow block times.  You could trade them though.  Might want to check to see if they plan on being up during fork.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:12:17
Yes. You will be perfectly safe doing that! 
One tip though: logging to gadx.com using your coinbase credentials. They are same company so same login username and password for both. 
Then within gdax, bring your coins over from coinbase. Now, you will still get both coins safely! But, when you sent the BTC to Kraken, you will pay ZERO fees!

They will need you bank routing and account number. They won't need your banks password. There are other ways to cash out small amounts of bitcoin. You can buy gift cards, for example. Take some time researching sidebar and searching this reddit. Lots of information to learn. The more you learn, the more comfortable you will be.

Could decentralized escrow smart contracts solve this problem?
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:23:51
Also, make sure your wallet allows you to export your private key(s) so you can utilize coin splitting tools to avoid replay attacks. Essentially, don't send/spend either coin until after they have been safely split!
It is possible your wallet will split the coins for you. You better check though!!!
Good luck and be safe.

I see the problem. It could be a problem with the jaxx wallet resending the TX or more likey a problem with blockcypher.

The "useless shitcoin" is called Segwit2x ot B2X. So, if you have access to your private keys, you will get an equal amount of B2X on or about the 16th. Make sure you follow instructions that will be available then on how to split the coins to avoid replay protection (theft). If you want someone to do this all for you put your bitcoins on GDAX/Coinbase and just wait. They will split them for you.
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:20:51
Still wildly dangerous even for the users of B2X, due to replay attacks on their BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:57:27
They can only replay the transactions (from main BTC chain) onto the private chain. There is no value in doing this and it is not an attack.

If you don't split them then you could become a victim of a replay attack.
For example: If you sent me .1BTC after fork, I could copy the TX from the bitcoin fork and broadcast it on the B2X for and I would get your B2X coins too! Essentially stealing them from you.

Just leave them. Don't move them until after the fork! They will create an additional wallet for you (during the fork) and place the forked coins in that wallet for you.
tldr; Just leave them on coinbase and relax!

Depends where you read that, but it is probably refering to the forking coin you will get for free. The B2X one!  LOL  This shitcoin has the potential to be disruptive to bitcoin though. If nothing else due to replay attacks. You shouldn't have to worry about those if you leave coins on Coinbase or better yet, GDAX.com
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:39:43
You are correct!  It doesn't matter if they are on gdax. You will receive the safely split coins. And since they are already in gdax, you can sell them quicker than the people who are holding in coinbase's wallets.

I am waiting until after the fork. I am sure there will be tools and instructions for several ways to safely do this. I will then pick the one I am most comfortable with.
Be safe.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:15:15
Correct. 
The difference with this fork (as opposed to the BCH fork) is that B2X is not including replay protection. 
To be safe and not lose BTC or B2X, do not send either until the dust settles after this fork. You will need to follow recommendations to split the coins so you can safely spend them.

I didn't think it was possible to sell BTC on blockchain.info. Are they an exchange now too?
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:54:55
If you want to buy cryptos that are not offered on GDAX/Coinbase, you need to find a different exchange. Don't confuse exchange with a wallet. 
That saidcheck here for some exchanges:  
Keep your coins off the exchanges when you are not trading.
Try Jaxx for a wallet for multiple currencies. Better yet, get a hardware wallet!
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:31:39
Correct. This is not the best way to split the coins. There are ways to do it safely though. I even suspect that the best way has yet to be coded/instructions given. The tools will be there when the fork happens.

bcash has a lot of support headed their way: 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:47:03
The simple and safe way is to send your bitcoins to your  account. If you don't have one, then create one. Once your coins are there, just wait until after the fork to move them. Coinbase will credit you with the forked B2X coins. 
Then relax!

This is what Electrum recommends:

No. It is an exchange. You are trusting them to hold your private keys. If they get hacked, etc, etc. you could lose your coins. However, they are FDIC insured so you should get them back. 
Coinbase has a "Vault" cold storage option. It might be construed to being a secure wallet. 
If you want really security, get a hardware wallet. Until then, try coinbase's vault. RESEARCH it first!!

Who knows. But if you leave it on GDAX through the fork, you won't have to do anything to get the B2X coins. They will automagically appear in a new wallet on gdax.

Yes. But there is one very dangerous thing you need to know about!
EVIL BOTS!  They will exist and they are fast little suckers. If they see you move those coins to say XMR(Monaro), They will try to replay the other coin on the other network. Even if you send both coins at the same time, they could still replay and if their transaction gets confirmed in a block before yours, you have lost.
My advice is to wait until after the fork to find a good answer to this.

You understand correctly. 
Just make sure that you have a backup of your private key (actual key or wordlist) stored safely on paper. 
I like paper wallets and hardware wallets for security.  if you're going to use a software wallet, use encryption and a password/pin.
I like breadwallet for iOS, mycelium for android or desktop.

I think you should research fungibility on bitcoin. 
Also, just because an amount of bitcoin (say 0.0135BTC) was once used to purchase drugs and it is now in your wallet because coinbase sent it to you, does not make it dirty/unspendable/etc.

So if BTC goes up 20%, I would be better just holding BTC instead of buying hashing?
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:04:50
Yea. You may want to try sending with a fee of 0. It will probably go through eventually. 
If it won't let you, you should try to export your private key(s) and then import them into a wallet. I don't think hardware wallets support this though.
If so, I would just keep your coins there! 
Good luck mate!

@_date: 2017-11-07 18:55:50
People will always have different opinions. Things always get political if they are valuble. People who fear bitcoin will try to destroy it. Increasing block size always leads to increasing blocksize again later. It is safer to be restrictive in changes rather than expanding in changes, because it create contentious hard forks.
Just my opinion. I am not that tech savy either!
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:09:04
If you hold your private keys, you will be able to split them after the fork. Doing so, will protect you from replay protection. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:46:48
Yes, but only if you send them or the B2X coins!, You!, likely if you and/or your wallet company do not safely split the coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:50:59
For beginners and the non tech savvy, yes. It is my opinion that would be a smart move. You could also move it to any other exchange that will split the coins too. I don't know of any yet.

Yes. Move them to gdax now, wait for split, wait for gdax to open backup (this could take awhile if things don't go too smoothly for them) and then sell B2X for BTC or cash.
Make sure you are allowed to have a gdax account. Some states and countries are prohibited. It may take a while for you to get your funds off of gdax because of limits due to KYC/AML laws in the USA. 
That should be pretty much comprehensive. Let me know if you find any errors.

You see the address on the coinbase website. You start a send transaction with the nano s chrome app. put the coinbase address in there. when you try to send it will have to send the address to the nano which displays the send to address on its own little screen. if it matches the address you see on the coinbase website, then you confirm it by pressing buttons on nano. nano then signs transaction with that addy. No way in hell to hack that, IMO.

If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Bitcoin is dependant on miners, but miners are greedy and will mine the most profitable coin. Since, I can't send small payments on bicoin right now, I use litecoin (been around and attacked for years without success) for small payments. 
That said, there is a fight going on and it is possible that bitcoin might lose the fight. I want the coins to fight it out so that they best coin wins. When a fight occurs, the smart fighters never show their cards until the fight is over. I am placing my bets on bitcoin, but I doubt they will use a POW change in this fight. Just my opinion.

in mycelium, select the account that had the BTC and BCC in it. Then in upper right hand corner select export.
select yes to continue. Then click to the right of public to select private (note: it may just be blank).  You will receive a warning. READ IT!!!
after you long press, you will see your private key at the bottom. Type that into electron cash import private key (I am not sure where this is look for it). Take your time, it is case sensitive and do not input the spaces.

Trezor will most likely have an update that does this for you. It may take a while for the update though. If they don't, it will still be possible to split them. You will just want to wait for a good guide and/or tools. Be patient and don't be the first one to try it!  ;)
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:38:29
Try ebay. The seller may ask you to send through paypal "friends and family" feature so you don't do a chargeback on them. 
BEWARE that they could take your money and not send the coins too! 
Use high rated sellers and do small transactions.
Good luck!

You will need an temporary wallet program for this. Install electrum app. It will ask if you want to import private key. select yes and carefully type in your blockchain.info private key. 
Here is how to get your private key out of blockchain.info wallet.
Login to your wallet on Blockchain.info
Click 'Import/Export' link in the second header
Click 'I Understand' to the advanced warning
On the left side menu click 'Export unencrypted'
Enter your secondary password
Select the 'Private Key Format' of 'Bitcoin-QT Format'
In the window underneath you will see a bunch of json formatted text (text enclosed in {} braces).
Search for the last few lines that look like "addr":"1Pd3","priv":"........"
Your private key will be the shown after the "priv" and will start with either the number 5 or the letter K
If that doesn't work let me know. About how old is your blockchain.info wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:32:49

@_date: 2017-11-05 01:06:32
Yes! Since they both share the same private key, you will need to split them before you try to spend them. This is especially true because B2X doesn't have replay protection. A week after fork there will be guides and tools to help you safely split them.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:23:28
Nice! I will buy some.
Good luck.

You can safely send from mycelium to your ledger (choose segwit when it asks you what kind of wallet you want) no matter what if you do it before the fork. Just like any normal transaction.

GreenBits has recently been updated with a variety of changes including UI updates, transaction limits, improved RBF and more validation to ensure users have backed up their mnemonics and are using the correct PIN.

Even if they don't support it, you will be able to export your private key to a soon to be created splitting tool/instructions. 
If you can bear the risk, put them on GDAX.com for the fork. Move them back to mycelium after fork.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:42:22
You can. Coinbase is insured. You will probably be safe. But, an important feature of bitcoin is that you possess the kkeys to the bitcoin on the blockchain. in an online wallet like gdax.coinbase, they hold your keys, so technically you don't really own them.

Bitcoin is going through exponential growth right now. High fees are a result of that. Segwit, sidechains and lightning network are recently available for programmers to fix the scaling/fee problem. It is possible that litecoin or some other coin will replace BTC as an everyday currency because of this. Maybe your coffee shop can take litecoin as easily as they take bitcoin today.

It is smart to invest in bitcoin. Just remember that you could lose it all!  
Bitcoin buying isn't really friendly in most countries. You probably will need help from an adult (I don't know why kids don't have more rights/freedom) like a parent or aunt/uncle. Someone to buy them off an exchange and then sell them to you.
If you have a bitcoin ATM, you could get them there too!
Either way, make sure you read about bitcoin and pick a good wallet.

It is complicated, but there is a process that you can use to get the bitcoin. Essentially, you need to establish the same private key (as the bitcoin cash one you sent it to) in a BITCOIN wallet. You will find the coins there.

You should just not spend anything (after the fork) until you have safely split your coins. Then you can resume safely sending and receiving.
Come back after the fork for some good info on how to safely split, etc.

The CME bitcoin futures will be "cash settled." This means that no bitcoin needs to be held in order to take a short or long position. All that is needed is enough cash to support your position. If you get margin called, it will be settled in USD and not in bitcoin.
However, due to this, every short position will HAVE to be matched (1 to 1) to someone elses long position and vice versa.
So, market makers will be those that have cash and not necessarily bitcoin. Also, you won't be able to short bitcoin unless someone has an equally long position that you can be paired with.
