As a Canadian I actually had the benefit of stumbling on this video earlier today on youtube and thoroughly enjoying its content. 
If you're a bitcoin advocate in any regard, I urge you watch the full 2 hrs because it is the most vital, critical and level headed conversation between an influential committee and a bitcoin prodigy I've ever witnessed.
It asked very important questions and came to a great conclusion at the end with foresight and tact.

As a printmaker that has sold work for dogecoin over at I am really enthusiastic about contemporary art and avenues for alternative commerce. 
I wish you luck with this website, as it looks incredibly promising. I believe artists will find cryptocurrencies a groundbreaking and valuable asset to their own practice as Bitcoin's viability and use becomes more pronounced in the future.

I wonder if at some point in the future all computing power would be used for minting crypto. 
That literally a person can't look at computers as multi use devices anymore and only look at it as a means for generating wealth.

What you linked is usually only for edging fabrics.
OP is a plain old embroidery machine, though also programmable.
