China is working on 'one road &amp; on belt' project (written in Communist Party Article) in a bid to integrate economies across Central Asia and even Africa. I think China needs to somehow has certain control over a RMB-backed cryptocurrency, which can facilitate free trades among these areas. I would assume many people in Central Asia or Africa do not have banking accounts to do trade with the Chinese. But they may have a cell phone to do crypto settlements.

USD360bn was the market cap for JP Morgan. Nevertheless, I noted that this number may NOT be a good reference to BTC's valuation as they are quite different in features (ie, BTC is commodity-like asset while JP Morgan is banking share which pays dividends and have vote in shareholders' meeting).

How many times do you think this "money out of thin air" (USD800m?) can be leveraged to buy cryptocurrencies? Traditional banking has about 10x leverage. Hedge fund may be capable of doing 15-20x. Assuming a multiply effect of 10x, this money can create purchasing power of USD8bn to artificially elevated BTC valuation way above the equilibrium level. 
What can be the catalyst to end this fraud? Liquidity crunch as people lose faith on BitXXnex? or simply government invention and arrest? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:51:36
Centralized organisations (ie, any government or even Tether) are always tempted to drop promises by printing more money than they are legitimately allowed. 
Who can audit this 'petrol' balanc, ensuring that the government is not abusing the system?

The bitcoin tank is too small for Wall Street sharks. So they are very smart to create the sea of "bitcoin paper" in order to capture the wave of emerging crypto assets. This will certainly dilute the buying interest for real bitcoins. 
But what if the "Bitcoin ETF" does not buy real BTC but just buy 'bitcoin paper' in future markets? 
That means we are just fXXcked to own real BTC?

Debt-hungry US may consider issuing BTC-denominated Treasuries, backing by tax revenue, which can be paid in BTC. 
Foreigners may not want to buy USD-denominated Treasuries. But foreigners may want to buy BTC-backed Treasuries. 
Indeed, Japan may be the first country to issue JGB backed by BTC, given BTC is already legal tenders. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:23:06
Japan is a bankrupt country with stunning debt loads which can never be paid back. They would be more than happy to print their worthless JPY to buy any other assets in the world. They are so desperate, thus willing to take a bet on digital currencies. This is why Japan is among the first of the developed countries to accept BTC. 
China still needs to control capital outflows to help stabilize domestic interest rate. I don't think they will open the gate to allow the Chinese to buy digital anytime soon.

I think BTC is just base currency. Once it has grown to the size of significant mass, there should be new business formations on top on BTC. I am thinking there could be BTC Bank, which accept deposits and make loans. They will be credit creation to support economic growth. Meantime, it also offer intrinsic value supports to BTC valuation. This is because LT holders could just earn interest revenue from their deposits to BTC bank. Just my 2 cents.

The tremendous price manipulation in BCH has also completely destroyed its creditability as either a medium of exchange or storage of value. Who would put his/her wealth in a currency whose prices can be so easily manipulated?

Adding derivatives to BTC will help complete the whole ecosystem, thus increasing trading volume. The greater the volume is, the higher the BTC prices.

Global savers, after experiencing years of being ripped off  by central bankers in numerous bailouts and money prints, have finally found the lifeboats with anchors to preserve wealth. The lifeboat (BTC) is so small with market cap of less than USD200bn. The early-moving savers are rushing onboard while the mass (led by institutional investors) will follow suit shortly. Enjoy the rride to 40K.

If US doesn't do it, Asian countries may be more than happy to leapfog US to launch future contracts to capitalize the first mover advantage and become the centre with pricing power over cryptocurrencies.  It's a competitive race to become the financial center of digital finance.

I think such rapid gains are normally captured by venture capitalists in the early development cycle of corporates or products/services. The mutual fund/hedge fund guys are NOT used to such a rapid pace, thus claiming in the mainstream media that BTC is only a bubble to likely end in tears. I think we are simple lucky to have a stake in disruptive technology at the early stage of developments. Enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:31:50
I agree with you. BTC prices have run ahead of its fundamentals. Further price upsides would depend on network scaling to expand  user base or growing risk aversion if stock/bond markets correct meaningfully.

Trading volume at BTC appears to be widely distributed. The breadth of market should offer supports on the downside. This is quite in a sharp contrast against Bcash, where 40% of trading volume was from a single exchange in Korea, a sign of price manipulation.

FIAT currencies are sinking to hell against BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:05:40
BTC has no intrinsic value. Its design is to ensure it can "survive" in any circumstances. It will survive when it's at USD1m per coin and it will remain existent if the price falls to USD1. Just reduced security. 
It's like "Noah's Ark". It has no intrinsic value (usefulness) in peace time. But when there is a flood (ie, fiat crisis), the Ark has tremendous value to help people store wealth. One has to pay a lot to get a ticket onboard the Ark.

I saw in the report that the estimated mining costs for one BTC would be RMB20K (or USD3K). Is this a fair estimate? If it's the case, USD3K would be the intrinsic value of BTC. Considering the other real-world utilities (payment, store value), there would be a lot of upsides for BTC to go in prices. 
Any person has any idea re. what will be the likely mining costs in 2019?

Is there risk control at all in Korea's exchanges where Mr. R &amp; Team buy and sell BCH for price manipulative? Would there be risks of "settlement default" that Mr. R does not have enough fiat to conclude all transactions intensively concentrated in last 24 hours or so?

Whichever exchanges offer retail investors margin trading facilities on BTC are not much different than the banks offering unqualified borrowers subprime mortgages prior to 2008. Sigh. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:45:23
Given that future contracts are settled in cash, it means that future market and spot market are not fungible with the other. I am worried that there will be two price points for BTC. The price in future market is determined by institutional investors while the price in spot market is by us retail investors. 
It's just like China's A share (listed in Shanghai) and H shares (listed in HK). They both represent the same corporate ownership. But the fact that they are not fungible, they trade in different prices, subject to their respective liquidity environment and market forces. To date, H shares (played by institutions) trade at discount to A shares (played by Chinese retails).

Will Jihan earn more mining profits if he reverts back to BTC (from Btrash)?

He was crying over half a million innocent people being murdered by reckless government decisions. I think he was even worse and more evil than the government. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:46:55
Is Jihan now making much less money in mining Bcash (rather than BTC), given Bcash trades at only 15% of BTC in prices and will likely to fall further as these coins are available for sales in next month or so. 
That said, will Jihan at the end quit Bcash and revert back to BTC?

With global economies inching closer to late cycles with risks of rising interest rate to ruin the party, I bet many institutional investors would rush to buy BTC as the "insurance policies" to protect downside risks from the pending market corrections or QE4orever, triggering another rounds of global currency competitive depreciation to the hell. 
Such "insurance policy of BTC" has only market cap of less than USD200bn, vs global financial market cap of USD700tn. I believe there exist huge upsides for BTC to go near term. Enjoy the ride. HODL.
