Serious problems like this make it absolutely clear that we need Free / Libre Hardware. *We* are the ones that should own our systems.  
  
Demand Libre Hardware. There is a campaign underway to have AMD Free their hardware and amazingly, the AMD CEO is listening. Find out more and add your support here:  
  
  
Please take this opportunity to [email](lisa.su AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, and propose releasing hardware under a Free / Libre licence. AMD is seriously looking at this possibility. Think what a win this would be!  
  
* **SUBJECT LINE: AMD+Libre**    
*  Full and Open DocumentationDrivers Released under a Free Licence
*  SupportDisabling of Platform Security Processor (PSP)
*  Enable GPU support in Virtual Machines  
  
These are a few goals that AMD could score with RYZEN.

The way BitCoin was set up there is a finite number of BitCoins that will ever be mined, i.e. produced. I believe there is a date for when we can expect the last BitCoin to be created.  
  
On top of this, a single BitCoin can only be subdivided into a limited number of smaller denominations. (The smallest unit is the Satoshi, named after the amazing inventor, it is said.)  
  
So the supply is limited and fixed forever.  
With paper money, there is no end to how many dollars one could put into circulation, for example.  It is even possible to mint a tiny, tiny platinum US dollar, and assign it an arbitrary value, for example, 100 trillion US dollars. (What an amazing way for the government to immediately eliminate the national debt, by the way. This happens to be a proprosal that has received serious discussion.)
