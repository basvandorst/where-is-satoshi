Another day, another (socalled) hack.
Japanese crypto exchange Bitpoint has suffered a $3.5 billion yen (\~$32 million) hack involving Bitcoin (BTC), XRP (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH) and 3 other cryptocurrencies. 2.5 billion yen (\~$23 million) of which belonged to customers and 1 billion (\~$9.2 million) to the exchange.

Basically, you are going to become a money mule. Most people who do it and end up in court/jail. People like you. You know it doesn't sound right but you like the idea of extra money. That is how most become money mules. Obviously, it's illegal.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:39:37
Now is not the time to buy. I bought some in February and March. Buy when low, sell when high. Never buy when the hype is on. It's going to crash. 
Mind you, I suspect BTC is going to go up again before the crash. The hype is not yet in full swing.
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:29:55
Why? Because it's European? Good to learn about trading?
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:57:08
The dip is over. Rising again. Paypay at €15 or €18k.
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:58:33
The dip is already over. Rising again.

25 bucks? Are you serious?
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:48:25
More like 50 years for the blindly greedy who bought BTC was it was at its highest point.
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:42:56
You can buy and sell on their site. So, this means it's completely secure (I think). I do think it's correct that you don't actually own Bitcoins or any of the other of 6 cryptocurrencies they offer.
One has to start somewhere, there seem to be a lot of scammers out there.
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:52:03
It's a start and it works well.
So, what do you use to store cryptocurrencies? Trezor? The most secure?
@_date: 2019-02-10 08:54:25
I plan on getting one within a month, Blockchain Lockbox. Just to learn about it.
Btw, does anybody know why Blockchain, after getting a copy of my ID, refused me to buy BTC twice. Both times, I used a prepaid Mastercard. Because they are prepaid? Skrill and another one.
It seems I will have to wait for verification and they buy them through my bank, with lower costs, it seems.
@_date: 2019-02-10 09:44:56
Well, I said Blockchain Lockbox because that would be the most logical at first sight. But from the little I've been reading... it seems that Trezor is a better option. The price is also higher. I still have to do some research before buying a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:40:31
It's 1.5% to buy, 1.5% to sell.
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:02:06
I do not plan to invest more than €100 pro currency, max. 10 or so. And do not plan to use any profits, but to take them out. So, if in invest in 10, my maxiumum loss would be 1k. I'm not going to end up under a bridge if that 1k vaporizes.
I do understand that cryptocoins are some kind of scam, but 'scamming' is the fundament of doing buseniss. So..
Yes, I do understand that I do not own on Skrill. But I used it as a starter.
@_date: 2019-02-08 14:01:11
The risk seems to be zero, as a starter. I already had a pre-paid credit card as an emergency, had to do nothing extra.
Works smoothly, very clear overview and very fast transactions.
But I'm sure that those who know all this stuff think it's not a great option. Security as a starter is the key issue with me.
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:20:35
Belgium, I will look into that as well.
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:07:31
I have a lot of reading to do, no doubt about it. But, I'm not sure what you mean by the above. Basically, what I am saying is that buying when a coin is very high and being hyped as hell is not a good idea.
@_date: 2019-02-10 19:44:49
I think that a mini-trading experiment with a little cash will help me to understand the crypto world better. If I lose everything, it's not a drama. We will see, not starting soon with that anyway.
I am a bit surprised by the nothing but negative reactions to trading, even on an experimental mini-scale. Nothing but losses it seems.
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:59:37
No, not thinking that it all. A profit should be possible if one knows what he is doing. It is also about learning everything connected to this crypto thing.
Wait five years? I will buy vintage/antiques and double my money within months.
Not that one excludes the other.
And one thing I did read and completely agreed with: don't use money you need. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:04:02
Who said that you paid 10k? I said those who paid 10k.
@_date: 2019-02-08 14:11:11
I have no idea what you are talking about but I'm sure I will as I get deeper into this stuff.
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:47:05
Well, yes. I want to learn what it all means and how to use. I do sell/buy little vintage/antique things and knowing all about crypto will be useful.
But I also believe it is some kind of 21st century Amway trick with scammers all over the place taking advantage of the blindly greedy.
@_date: 2019-02-10 10:52:59
I understand but I've got to start somewhere. 3 cryptocurrencies available, I will invest only €300 on Blockchain. My plan is, when I get the hang of it, to do some Day trading cryptocurrency on a mini-scale.
The amount of information out there is massive and I'm sure a ton of sites/companies are scams (just look at the chap who 'died' and millions who have 'vanished').
Segwit? No idead what that is. So, another thing to look up. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:30:41
One needs an exit strategy. For some or everything. I decided that I would sell some at €12K. Bought 10 gold coins at €12.1K, paid with BTC. BTC dropped over €2000 20 mins later.
Whatever, never panic. But then again, the money is made when the "masses" get involved and panic.
@_date: 2019-02-10 14:58:42
How common (and why?)  is it for users to use several companies? Thanks.
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:13:38
I'm sure that those who understand cryptos think it is silly to exchange them Skrill but it was my first step. I will probably think the same in some time.
I'm sure I will mess things up a newbie. But, who wins from trading then? Have you tried it?
@_date: 2019-02-10 07:48:46
There is certainly a lot of truth in that but... it also sounds very Amway. I attended a big Amway gathering in Germany way back when I was a marketing student. Same shit.
The truth of the matter is that few will make a lot of money and most will lose a lot of money.
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:04:53
Well, more of a testing out things with a max of 1k. I need to learn more about all this virtual money stuff.
I did figure out that a hard wallet is a must and the importance of a backup.
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:32:53
Yes, I was on such a site, a guy claiming he made 20 million and if you sign up, for $600, he will explain to you how to do it. There's a sucker born every minute. I'm not naive about these things.
Trading is a big word with 1k. Not only BTC but with several crypto-coins. Just to get to know things better. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 11:30:44
Yes, trading goods is also a reason I want to learn all about BTC.
Reading and thinking is all fine but nothing beats the experience, the learning curve. 
I have a degree in economics/marketing and worked in that field for many years. Not saying that is special, but it helps. Anyway, we will see how it goes. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:19:50
I had to look up Hodl. How is that working out for those, blinded by greed and joining the hype, bought BTC when the price was over 10k?
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:41:40
No, just convert. Min. of €10, fee of 1,5% in both directions.
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:34:57
I just have a credit card there and since it is now an option, I am just testing it out. I signed up for Blockchain and waiting to get approved. Bitstamp looks good as well, have it bookmarked to research it.
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:15:53
Some will buy at 18k, like last time, and will end up with huge losses and post HODL all the time here.
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:28:02
I'm with this bank. It was free and now you will have to pay 50 cents every time. One time a month is free. Quite frankly, I don't even withdraw cash once a month.
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:50:29
I just moved some money from Skrill prepaid to BTC.  + €135 'profit' in 20 days, I was lucky it seems with my timing. Btw, Skrill never screwed their clients as far as I know. You can't say the same of all those 'making better world' crypto scammers. Worse than banks, it seems.
@_date: 2019-02-12 11:25:22
Thanks. I'm bought €100 BTC on Blockchain. It's a start. Certainly have them bookmarked for when I want to try out another service.
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:09:36
Well, you're wrong. And there is nothing weird about the questions I ask nor my answers. Just put me on ignore, case solved.
@_date: 2019-04-04 08:32:53
Here, Thx:
@_date: 2019-04-23 09:57:59
What do you mean by "all your stuff"?
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:23:42
No idea what it is, but thanks anyway, mate.
@_date: 2019-04-05 11:18:51
Get ready. It's going up and will be doing so for the next 24hrs.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:30:28
I'll give you a final thought: cry me a river.
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:12:15
BTC is going to drop soon. Very soon. This is not the time, yet.
@_date: 2019-04-05 14:11:55
Actually, I'm as dissident as they get. Don't watch the tele, haven't bought a  newspaper in over 20. So, once again, you're wrong.
Not going to look into the case again, did it back then, and as far I'm concerned... he should have gotten the death penalty.
I don't consider ordering hits to be the worst thing about him btw. 
Non-violent crimes are often the worst and make the most victims (suicides, ruined lives, etc...). That's why I am for the death penalty for banksters and drug barons.
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:46:38
The guy is a complete scumbag. A typical do-gooder to the outside world while ordering hits on his opponents and whatnot. Good riddance.
Stop making Florence Nightingale out of him. 
and wtf has this to do with BTC?
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:23:34
No, that's a sectarian attitude and beyond stupid. For people to make money... a lot of people need to lose money.
@_date: 2019-04-07 07:45:51
Get ready because it's coming. And when it's coming, it's coming.
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:11:10
I said: most. And that is how it works. Buy when it is low is obviously the way to go.
Those who bought at 20k are fücked without a hype, it's the hype that created that 20k to begin with. 
You don't understand how it really works, friendo.
@_date: 2019-04-09 08:57:53
BTC is a magnet for scammers, I already got a PM as well. It's big, big business, suckers all over the place.
@_date: 2019-04-23 08:28:11
 Hate to be that guy : nope.
Btw €5K is now really coming. Only €50 to go!
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:15:53
Bizarre. Collapsing. Any reason? Down €400 in a sec.
@_date: 2019-04-12 16:26:49
BTC can and will be seized. Already happened plenty of times in Europe and the US.
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:55:43
Folks, it's a bit back and forth but it's coming. You can't stop the eruption when it's coming.
@_date: 2019-04-16 17:31:19
It's going up. Fast. It's coming.
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:29:39
I bought euro 2k BTC (and some BCH) starting in february till late march. My "profit" is over €500. Complete newbie and a bit lucky it seems. I need to learn about this BTC stuff. It's a scam based on greed, but so is everything.
@_date: 2019-04-04 20:01:50
The first rule: don't panic.
Just make a list of all emails you have used in the past and try them one after another.
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:34:20
Hmm no. And if you have to ask... certainly no.
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:10:53
It's going up. Fast. It's cuming!
@_date: 2019-04-16 17:41:24
It's the Notre Dame effect. Get ready!
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:28:54
Ross is a complete scumbag who would steal billions of BTC if he could. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:07:05
He is where he belongs. I've look into this case way back. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 13:35:02
I certainly didn't study the whole concept enough but that's not needed to "jump in". We will see.
Just one question: do you think BTC is already too big to fail?
(Considering all the altcoins who have vanished)
@_date: 2019-04-10 08:30:14
It's all about creating a hype. That's how BTC got to 20k. A bowl of hot air making a lot of money to some. Most will lose money.
@_date: 2019-04-03 19:16:37
Blockchain and Binance are real. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:14:31
If you ask me in a really nice way to show me that you are an outstanding human being... I will!
I like to make new friends on the internut!
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:36:47
It's based on greed, speculation, manipulation with some winners and mostly losers. 
That's all I need to know for now. That's the big picture. 
Not judging, just observing. 
All fine with me (as long as I end up in the winning camp).
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:21:42










 In other words, friendo, you need to learn when it is time to keep your big mouth shut.
@_date: 2019-04-23 07:45:03
€5k - Soon. It's coming.
@_date: 2019-04-05 09:14:11
You have people buying these in China and then selling them online as 'real' Bitcoins. You actually have morons who buy them and think they have now real Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-04-04 08:49:35
Received, Thanks. It's my first ever free crypto.
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:51:49
The only thing this guy wanted to create was a fortune for himself covering it up as a 'good cause'. 
And he wanted to kill all those in his way. 
Stop with this 'peaceful world' angle.
Uncontrollable greed.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:36:01
It's coming. And when it's coming...no way to stop it.
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:57:49
Currently? It's coming right now. Going up fast.
@_date: 2019-05-04 11:05:45
Dude, kindly FU.
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:29:22
Good. You're catching on, friendo.
@_date: 2019-05-03 08:18:08
I told you it was coming yesterday. Have some faith in me!
And it ain't over, I can feel more coming.
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:28:11
 I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord  
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord  
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
@_date: 2019-05-18 09:47:54
Because Reddit is having issues. Posts don't show up, people can't log in, etc...
@_date: 2019-05-02 14:56:15
If I feel it, it's coming. Trust me on this one, friendo.
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:44:02
95% BTC  and 5% one Alt. Pissed off, alt isn't performing.
@_date: 2019-05-04 09:59:41
Folks, the push isn't over. I can still feel it coming.
@_date: 2019-05-02 10:35:55
It's coming, folks. It's coming. I can feel it.
