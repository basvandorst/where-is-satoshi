Can James tackle the lack of whites in the NFL and NBA next.   Too many whites = bad news to James it seems.  Maybe cause he has black wife?  It seems Uganda has stamped out "institutional racism" and is now a paradise.  It's only natural that James would want to darken up the US to achieve the same goals.

After further review it looks like the person did send a dollar to somewhere.  The thing that got me was 2 people messaging me from the same city that is hundreds of miles away within minutes of eachother, when I've never had anyone try to buy from me ever. lol

I will try to do better if I get anymore.  It was just out of the blue and the fact that they were asking for a dollar really made me suspicious, since I thought the ads were 7 bucks to post.  We need to get more people to put ads up on Mycelium.  I'm in western NC, they were in eastern NC and picked me, even though Charlotte was in between and only one guy in Charlotte with an ad.

I agree thats why I'm into Bitcoin.  Gold and Silver sellers and prep item sellers make sure to scare the shit out of your average joe like OP 24/7 because they want him to buy their products though.

First off its a nice bitcoin wallet ingrained with a messenger app.  Sending BTC to someone is as easy as clicking heir name and typing how much.  No Addresses needed
Gems are used to give incentive for people to share with their friends and bring them onboard, and you can earn them other ways.  I believe the bigger vision is that advertisers will pay to send you unsolicited messages.  Instead of someone like FB getting the money, you set how much advertisers have to pay (if you want to receive ads), and you get the money instead (in gems of course). 
I never quite got it either, but when I saw they got a round of VC funding I started trying to understand it. 
Here is an hour long interview from last november, lots has happened since then but seems to be sticking to the vision.  Gems the token is run on counterparty which is run on top of Bitcoin, so its all connected.

Is mycelium fully open source?

Not sure of all the reasons, but I think one was to get initial funding to get the project off the ground.   The token was used for that.

Didn't know that existed, but after watching the video, the getgems wallet seems alot more slick and user friendly.  Plus there is incentive to use it and refer people.

Offtopic.  Can you set a message to self destruct on getgems? I dont see how.
