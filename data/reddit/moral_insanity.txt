No! People are put off because it is so fucking difficult to buy without:A) meeting a random stranger and handing over a stack of cash. B) putting all my personal details (copy of driving license, sort code, account number, name and address on some random fucking website that seems to be the latest in a long list of sites to get hacker. Until it is more accessible it wont go far.

Of course.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:58:15
Of course they are! 
Have you actually verified? (no you haven't) so you're taking their word for it just as everyone took the word of MtGox.

The last sentence is pretty much correct.

That is not the argument though. Until Bitcoin is more accessible it will only be a speculative item for gamblers. I'm not going to risk converting all more GBP to bitcoin until its secure. Right now. It is completely diabolical how much risk that I, as the adopter have to take on.

Just as I predicted ages ago.

Gold is completely different to Bitcoin at this moment in time. The latter is driven right now out of blind hype and people with no intention of staying in bitcoin investing for a quick profit.
And that's without the unknown of what happens if the very first people involved decide they have milked everyone enough and cash out.

That's the same spin everyone keeps trying to sell. This whole thing can come tumbling down through basic psychology herding everyone into the same conclusions. And as most people investing at the moment are only doing it for the profit, it won't take that much to spook them into selling.

I would simply cash that money out into your bank account and wait for a few weeks or months to see what happens.
Put it this way, leaving it in MtGox is not the same as having it in your account or hands. If and when something major happens I can see them holding all funds or simply closing down leaving you out of pocket.

So because there has not been a crash within "a few days" you think you made the wrong choice?

Advertisers? Application Developers? etc it's a marketing company essentially. Which means it IS worth something.

The only financially savvy people here have been hounded and castigated for the past two weeks for not towing the party line and proclaiming "this is just the beginning, have no fear. We are taking off".
This subreddit is full of 3 types of people. Brainwashed sheep who genuinely believed this was ever going to end well, and people who have been telling people to cash in so the price stays up and they can cash out. And then people like me who predicted what is about to come and have sat enjoying the ride.

You tell me. Early investors? the very people that made the whole thing?
Either way, the psychology involved in this is no different to anything else. If the people who hold the brunt of the coins start deciding to sell off (and I don't know them, I don't think you do either so we can't say what their motives are) then we will see the exact same bank run type event that will rape the value.
I'd look at it this way, if you bought into it for the cause then stick with it. If anyone has bought into this hoping to profit (especially late investors) then this can all turn into something very similar to the results of a pyramid scheme, where those that bought in last find themselves unable to get their initial investment back.
And how many times do you think this can bounce back from a massive crash before people start going "Actually, it all sounds like a bit of a scam"?

"unless you assumed the price for each day would always end up to be higher than the day before."
Exactly what the hype had people believe. I think we will continue to see a drop as everyone begins selling off due to realizing that this isn't some revolutionary product and is more just some speculative stock that is completely void of any regulation and thus get's bummed by anyone willing to make the market, which I think most people don't want to be part of.

Amazing story.
Yesterday I put £100 in £10 stacks around single 0 on the roulette wheel. I won £360. I then put it all in again and lost it all in the very next spin.
If you treat gambling as if the money matters then you are going to end up disappointed.
I treat it like it's either £100 of good time money. Sometimes I just may come away with more than a went out with instead of a hang over.

Crash incoming. The only thing propping up prices is hype! and that's not a good thing.
We can all pretend that the price is being pushed up by genuine interest or retailers beginning to accept it or by acceptance but it isn't. 
It's being pushed up by hype which means once people realize "Actually, I have $500 I can't afford in some alternative currency I can't actually use in day to day life" then the "run on the bank" begins and the prices will plummet.
Wait for the people who are running this whole gig to cash out leaving all the recent investors well out of pocket just like Charles did.

It's a massive ponzie scheme mate, taking from Peter to pay Paul.
They can continue to ship barely any units and can even afford to produce them at a massive loss knowing full well they can sustain it long enough through new orders that when they go pop they will have already made a killing.

This, you could use Azure as well. Plenty of better ways to run this show than just having a few hosted servers in some naff hosting company.

I would bail out now if you can. If you think they are going to stop they aren't. The only people going to be left out are your average bit coin guy who bought in recently whilst the early adopters and market makers cash out knowing it's a job well done hyping it all up to boiling point so that every mug comes and parts with his cash.
Mark my word. Mtgox will close down within the month taking your money with it if you don't remove it.

One of the most interesting things that immediately came to my mind after being involved in this sort of thing before was Identity Theft.
MtGox has tens of thousands of peoples personal details (and I'm not talking email address and phone numbers). I'm talking Driving License numbers, addresses, D.O.B etc. Everything necessary to steal someone's identity, and yet everyone is handing over personal details hand over fist to use a currency that's "anonymous".
