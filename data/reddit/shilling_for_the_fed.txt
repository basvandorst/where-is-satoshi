Bitcoin is as much money as Chuck-E-Cheese tokens are money. It can be used to buy pizza, but almost no one accepts it for payment. Which means it isn't actual money.

Why didnt you just use real money? Much easier that way and wouldn't have to deal with these unnecessary problems. Use the right tool for the job; you can't build a house with only a hammer.

Anyone who has a 500k+ retirement portfolio (which, by the way, millions of Americans have) wake up on a daily basis being down thousands of dollars. As well as up thousands of dollars. It's really no big deal.

You deserved it. A fool and his money after all. Free market will regulate it since only dumb people will put their money in an exchange that repeatedly screws their customers.

You're not allowed to talk about it, the people that own this sub decided that anyone mentioning it will be deleted.

Tons of people run cash businesses depositing 4 and 5 figure sums daily without having this problem. If it's a problem for you you're probably running a shady business and its on you to prove to the authorities that the deposits are legitimate. Still don't see however what any of this has to do with MSB  which you are required by law to have to sell bitcoins to others. And I'm not sure why you brought it up in the first place since it has nothing to do with the original topic of discussion.

Which would mean more men. *HIGH FIVE*

Deny reality all you want, it doesn't matter. The way anti money launder laws work you *MUST* prove the legitimacy of your funds when you deposit amounts suspect of structuring.
@_date: 2015-07-18 21:05:23
Structuring only applies to making deposits sum total to $10k or over. So you're wrong, that doesn't apply to every case.

Since youre obsessed with downvotes here is another from me to you.

Money laundering is not equivalent to rape and murder. I'm sorry but you're living in an ancapistan fantasy world.
@_date: 2015-07-18 22:42:24
I don't think you understand how the law work. Making structured deposits it is on **YOU** to prove that they are legitimate. Just because you have this idealized view of how the world is supposed to work doesn't make it the reality.

What does that have to do with the MSB laws? Nothing. You're going on a tangent for no reason out of angst.
