I had alt coins  ($300 worth) I bought a week before my honey moon @ end of 2017. Wife told me to leave my laptop at home and focus on us while away. My valuation shot up to 96k by the time I was on the slopes. When I got back home to sell 2 weeks later  it had tanked to 600$..
I divorced last year.

Also.. if corporate debt bankrupts large business.. yes it would suck during the liquidity phase.. but then wouldn't the business and their assets just be bought on the cheap at a more realistic value the market can support ? I would think a crash of some level would be good as that's when money is made. Buy cheap.. then sell high before the correction.

Increasing money supply decreases its value.. 
Why would they do this ?

Why are there so many loan types with varying nuances ??? Why not just have a loan.. over a period of time with a reasonable and fair interest rate depending on credit rating and let the chips fall where they may?

So then it's a balancing act of the boom and bust cycle and societies ability to keep their shit together and maintain a level of decency of supporting their fellow man/woman... Well it's been nice knowing everyone.:?;(

Can I have 1 Bitcoin?

If it has Bitcoin on it... You keep it.  Otherwise, what does it all mean if it can be tracked.
