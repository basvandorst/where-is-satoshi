That’s why we’re down?!
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:13:19
I would say 12k ��
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:21:56
It looks like we’ll be headed to the 100 day average ��
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:31:00
Everything I have is in paper wallets aswell.. never sold a penny..
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:03:03
Fuck knows ��
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:58:57
Not for long.. it’ll manage to close red again ��
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:08:47
Me too.. I don’t give a fuck anymore. Always the same story, if it’s not the government is a dickhead saying that bitcoin will burst.. oh really? Fuck off.. give it 3 days and markets will go back to normal..
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:06:02
Where’s the next support level? 8k?
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:13:36
Same here.. it looks very bad.. I thought the dominance would be higher tough, still hanging on 36%.. the coinmarketcap looks horrible, so many billions missing ��
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:59:39
11k is out of the question for sure
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:24:25
I wouldn’t be surprised to be fare.. btc it’s not doing nothing at the moment, just losing value day after day..
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:24:30
I still in profit believe me.. but we’re all tired to be attacked by bears all the time 
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:50:32
Yes, get ready for that
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:00:13
I’ve all my funds in paper wallets.. I never had any problem with it.. just make sure you generate the wallet with the WiFi off, and keep all the information of it..
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:14:32
Oh so you know what’s going on?? Can u tell us?
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:50:50
Apparently it’s bank holiday today. Tomorrow will be a better day, fingers crossed �� 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:10:35
It’s getting really enoying �� I want to believe that it’s a matter of time but everyday I see btc loosing for this shit coins..
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:44:35
Why is good for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:06:05
They say February it’ll not be better.. I don’t know what’s is causing this sell off ��
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:04:24
The storm isn’t over.. the new lunar year is on the 16th of February.. hodl on tight 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:25:58
He’s right.. our biggest mistake is keeping compare bitcoin with dollars/euro/yen, etc.. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:11:19
What fuck is going on now?
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:55:26
Who cares? I think everyone is tired to be low all the time! I’m starting to be concerned about this, to be fare.. the way I see it it’s not healthy..
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:10:01
Impossible! This was meant to be a good week.. we’re all tired seeing red all the time. Where are u bulls? I miss u a lot �� damn it
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:03:37
Not huge! At least for me! It was s good start, yes, but nothing like the old days.. I just checked the charts and it’s declining again, I’m a hodler but I’m starting to be fed up with this, honestly..
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:21:52
Fucker ��
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:43:21
Every “little “ bit helps!!
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:05:05
Well, it looks like people are cashing out according with coin market cap..
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:28:31
Stellar I think 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:48:00
So what? Give it another week to see what happens 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:35:05
One bitcoin worths one bitcoin! That’s it! In a few years you’ll not have dollars to compare it! Keep that in mind!
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:20:58
It’s so true 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:48:45
I thought this would be a good week ��
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:49:33
Next month you’ll be loaded ��
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:30:21
This dip is just manipulation! I start to believe that is the governments on the back spreading fud for people to sell it.. if people panic, like they are, they will sell and they will pay bloody taxes, it’s all about that.. I’m discarding completely the new lunar year or China ban icos, anyway, how many times can China ban icos? I thought they were out of the map all ready! 
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:31:32
Listen, I wouldn’t mind if things would go back to normal NOW.. but it doesn’t depend on us, does it? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:30:14
Who are you to classify who should be or not in the game? Get lost mate
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:26:39
Fodasse ��
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:53:44
Looking forward to that �� but will we be ready for red candles of 20k$ or 10k$? Because we’re not ready for 2k$ a day, now imagine 10k or 20k! That will be fucked up man!
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:29:51
Bitcoin is loosing dominance every day.. and this fucking crap is being winning value every day! When is this gonna change?
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:36:29
Are we? ��
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:09:27
I know.. I wasn’t like that before it raise until the 20k, I saw this dips plenty times and I’ll see them again in a near future, but I can’t help myself..
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:46:28
And pay taxes! That’s why we’ve all this fucking dips! Governments are on the background of all this mess! They spred fud so people start to freak out, sell off and pay taxes! It’s what is all about! Bloody taxes!
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:55:59
Let it breathe! How many times it had a bearish trend today and suddenly went up??
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:53:29
oh and you really think euro and usd will escape from crash? This is the future, dollar will crash before we know!
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:49:50
I never had any problem.. everything I have is in paper wallets, even all the btc forks. You just need to generate the wallet in offline mode ��
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:09:58
Well I live in uk but I meant 8k dollars
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:56:49
I’m not sure. I only transferred once to claim my bch and I’ve transferred the all lot to another paper wallet and at the end I didn’t claim it. But it doesn’t make sense that we’ve to transfer everything or we’ll lost whatever is left. Anyway so many hackers stilling btc  with just the public address.. in case, spreed in more wallets.. I’ve 2 wallets just for btc..
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:21:03
Bitcoin is loosing dominance every day.. and this fucking crap is being winning value every day! When is this gonna change?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:00:40
Yep, unfortunately that’s what I’m expecting honestly.. I’m preparing myself for it.. if it goes up, better.. I hope it doesn’t go any lower than 8k tough.. many people are looking/waiting for that number so hopefully, after that it’ll go back to “normal “( I don’t know what is the normal tough)
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:40:46
Whatever mate
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:10:59
I hope you enjoy to be disappointed ��
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:05:16
I know how you feel.. I thought today it would be a great day �� I can see we’ll close the day red again ��
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:12:59
I’m not psychologically to another red day today ��
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:04:00
Impossible! This was meant to be a good week.. we’re all tired seeing red all the time. Where are u bulls? I miss u a lot �� damn it
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:27:14
Because we’ve the new lunar year coming on the mid of February.. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:19:36
Where’s your sense of humour?? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:55:35
Because he’s an idiot.. I got 2 jobs and a 2 year old girl, do you think ive sold any of my bitcoin? NEVER!! I’m still hodling and I’ll keep doing! We’re STRONG ���� 
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:53:18
Do whatever you want, don’t complain in the next couple of months! 
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:07:14
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:45:55
Bloody hell! If it has to go lower as 8k to restart the fucking engine again, what are you waiting for? I had enough of 2018 all ready ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:42:49
$1 lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:25:59
That’s what I gave to my partner for Christmas ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:49:10
Big correction for xpr on the way! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:01:18
What a f.... day! Congrats to all the hodlers! Merry Christmas and a HAPPY NEW YEAR ( it’ll be very promising)!
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:04:53
Can it go lower? I never hated so much red in my life ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:37:59
Why market is all red?? 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:28:23
This is so enoying lately �� to dip it goes very fast, to recover it takes ages.. and it doesn’t goes above 12k anymore, people are not interested! What a fuck is going on?
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:29:41
I’ve mention tether but I could mention another thousand things, I believe in bitcoin, I think, maybe that’s why I’ve never cashed out waiting to see what happens.. but the feeling never been so negative as now.. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:43:40
I know, but yesterday in the morning Bitcoin was traded around $5800ish, it’s clearly a bounce back.. fingers crossed for the $10k soon 
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:06:48
I don’t know honestly. I think people are not interested anymore 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:47:45
Lol where are your “reliable sources “?
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:52:57
Same thing with Wall Street bonuses that would bring btc to the top again. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:01:06
Why is he a moron? He shared his experience with us.. I was very close to do it aswell but I didn’t because I knew that soon or later it would go up again! He learned his lesson, I don’t think he needs this kind of comments from stupid people!
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:00:03
We should bounce back at any point, right??
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:03:04
When this is going to stop? If turns out tether is fake, that’s it, the end! I’m not spreading any FUD but this looks very scary everyday that pass.. I’m scared of looking at the price..
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:33:55
Sorry dude, I’m not seeing bitcoin skyrocketing that soon ( like always does).. people are not buying bitcoin in this dip, if this is the dip, I don’t know what’s the dip anymore..
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:14:17
The only moron I see here is you! Seriously that I’m losing my time with this?? Please
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:46:07
With brexit, while markets were crashing bad, bitcoin was rising.. the dollar rise with trump as president, and bitcoin did rise aswell.. don’t know why people is expecting the crypto market crash again, in fact this is a really good thing!
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:24:26
Don’t worry! In a few months we’ll feel sorry for you not to hodl bitcoin! I’ll see u from the top, where the air is fresher!
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:20:59
Was it that bad last year? Sorry folks, I only get in on July.. just wondering if it’s like that every January.. thanks in advance to the ones that replies..
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:17:51
Why is dropping so hard?
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:44:08
Where are the strong buy walls at $8k?? Common pussies where are your buying orders? It’s below $8k ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:13:46
Yeah, but it’ll bring a domino effect as always.. I hope not but no one can give a little fart and everyone is rushing selling it!
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:14:09
Yeah, but it’ll bring a domino effect as always.. I hope not but no one can give a little fart and everyone is rushing selling it!
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:43:34
Where’s the next support level?? $8k??
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:46:32

@_date: 2018-02-10 12:20:55
It was..
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:26:29
Why should drop more than what it did?? Honestly.. I think the storm just passed, so many negative comments around here..
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:20:28
Lol I hope I’m wrong but the feeling never been so negative as it is..
