This has to be troll. It’s literally just as simple as you’ve explained. Just a few minutes and you’re done.

Pretty sure that is Warren Buffet's wallet.

Silly post. Silly title.

This guy sounded like a huge clown when he said $50k and then said he really has no idea and doesn't care.  Completely irrelevant guest on the show.

Quality post.

Just fyi, I still use a TD debit card with no issues at all. I think TD is only Visa purchases. 
BMO sucks balls though anyway. Shit bank. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:40:02
Haha I was thinking the exact same thing!

Begging for crypto. Love it.

Although I think you may experience a big verification delay, Quadriga has been great for me. The Interac Online funding option has worked perfectly.

She’s safe.  Not in the bathroom with me. Still taking this shit. Damn. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:20:49
Damn, I forgot to wipe!
@_date: 2018-03-10 01:44:58
I’m currently taking a shit and this made me laugh so hard that my wife asked if I was ok.

Also I would note that you're probably better off breaking up your cash out into segments rather than cashing everything out at once.  Seems like a safer bet.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:54:15
Don is that you?
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:51:26

You don’t have the datas on your phone?

At first I thought this was a 14TB ssd.  Sadface.

I use TD to fund/withdrawal and I have never had any problems.
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:20:06
So $11 cad now?
