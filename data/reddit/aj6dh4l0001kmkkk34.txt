you can still use the currency for permissionless and instant cross-border payments for arbitrary amounts even if you trust someone else to secure your keys. but everything seems to be either black or white in your world. there is THE ULTIMATE ONE TRUE RIGHT AND CORRECT AND GOOD or there is wrong. that's got to be an exhausting and frustrating way to live. good luck with that!

to the first point: i think a trusted subset of the 10k or so full nodes he mentioned would be the source of utxo set hash for joe average's node/wallet/client. he could get the full set from anyone. also trusted here just means it's expected that given a random handful of these known nodes it's sufficiently unlikely they would all be colluding to attack.

30k users doesn't seem too great.

was it something i said? i mean they've been around for like 1.5 years. that's objectively concerning growth.

chain seems like they're trying to find some economically viable pivot in this space as clearly a premium hosted API didn't seem to have much demand. feels more like a hail mary to me but we'll see.
