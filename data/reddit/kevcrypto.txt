I can barely take it anymore... HODLING 100+BTC is starting to test my mental sanity.

Crazier ever for me.
Can't comment about 2009-2012, these times were actually more volatile!

I don't see BTC price going below 5k$USD unless there is a worldwide ban.

Over 10+ transactions totaling 6digits and never any hassle.

Fear of North Korea &amp; TechHub... What do you think happens to their Stock Market/Currency if NK nukes Seoul?

I too still is interested in their arguments and isn't decided regarding small vs big block.
However, their sub has become complete trash, unfortunately.

Massive ! Good job to all the devs. Is there a way to donate to them ?

Currently shopping... 
Seriously tho, it is kinda hard to sell since I believe in BTC &amp; has been in it since 2013.
It is starting to feel like Nov/Dec 2013 (not in a good way).

Problem with gold is that its price is suppressed. 
Gold should be trading at around $5000 right now.
People having more than 50% in cryptos should consider taking profit and buying some gold.

Any links?
How do they intent do enforce it!?
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:29:28
Good thing my first language is french ;)
It does not state a ban but more a word of warning and declaring where it came from.

Interesting but how do the expenses related to owning real estate applies to the tokens?
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:36:29
Easy to say when you hold less than 1BTC

Change browser, it worked for someone in my entourage.
EDIT: Didn't mean to sounds like an asshole. My first language is French and the word entourage means like people close to you.

Easy to say when u live in mum's basement. When u have legit assets (Real estate/mutual funds/business) it is a different story.
I've lived in a country where there are no taxes and the pill is much easier the swallow considering all the benefits I have (Canada).
Is our tax money well managed? Clearly not, but at least it's not a total fraud like many Latins country.

You tell that to the judge and we shall see the outcome, smartass
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:32:44
It is legit, follow their guidelines and don't be stupid. If something is too good to be true it likely is.
