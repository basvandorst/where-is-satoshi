How the hell is it that I always had such a hard time in the journalism field?! It can't be this easy to critique while at the same time being so hard to avoid such the same obvious mistakes that you're always making fun of other people for.

Gonna cost a lot to get that knee replaced.

How insane would it be if you went to a local militia, and they said,  "This is wrong and unconstitutional," and did something about it?

Iranian sanctions are in place for a very wide array of reasons, but it mostly boils down to the US government trying to pressure the Iranian government for several different things from nuclear negotiations to tobacco company interests.

I still laughed at some of these, though.

Standard, but you can get wired for 240 on residential without any issues, usually.

You can still use others that are licensed. Even if you didn't, the fault lies with the company selling them, not you.

Good luck tracking my BTC worth, divorce lawyers. "Oh, yeah, I traded all my crypto for a boat that subsequently sank in the middle of the Pacific...uninsured."
Or "I lost my address. It's all gone now."

No offense, but it might be you and the people that surround you. That sounds kinda mean, but I don't mean it that way.

Oh no now somebody knows some guy on reddit has money ��

The statistics are a little skewed by serial divorcees. If neither person has been previously married, odds are they'll stay together. Chances also improve if their parents have never been divorced.

I'm somewhat active with Bitcoin, but I'm mostly a lurker here. I feel like that's 99% of the community here. You're just seeing the scum that floats to the top.

It's also possible, with the vast amount of people that circumnavigate Chinese Internet regulations on a regular basis, that ordinary citizens are going through those venues instead of BTCC for some reason. I know very little about bitcoin compared with those on this sub, but that seems very likely.

This why it's been predictable, and while I mostly HODL, I've been riding this wave by buying and selling here and there and have made a neat little profit.

It's funny because, emotionally, I'm never happy with bitcoin prices. When they're low, I wish they were high so I could have better value. When they're high, I wish they were low because I feel like I missed the boat to have even more.
