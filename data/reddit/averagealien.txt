It's the essence of HODL (Hold On and Don't Look!)... upgrades to the coin are being implemented as we speak. It's not about to die any time soon. It will go back up.

For some reason when the term HODL came about I just always assumed it meant Hold On and Don't Look!

Shit..... I had 0.18 BTC on gox... It was cool seeing it become like $240 at it's peak. All from leaving my comp mining for a week like a year or so ago.
Sucks that it's gone now. Glad I didn't ever actually invest cash into it though.

I predict bubbles, constant bubbles of differing sizes.

I never bought... just mined and traded since before the MtGox days... the worst thing that happened for me was when it was starting to tank at $19k I sold it for an altcoin, which in turn lost half of its value in relation to BTC... so I ended up amplifying the loss... owwie

Certain alts seemed to be more stable at the time. But of course I screwed that up by trading into it. As soon as investors saw my trade go through, they knew it was time to dump everything, as is tradition.

I assume it's a way to battle triangular arbitrage while also fully verifying the transaction.

On the same note. How do they know that OP was the one who gambled with the money? He said he bouced it to a few different wallets. Any one of those transfers could have been a transaction for a good or service. 
That's like arresting you because the money you used to buy a soda was later used by someone to buy cocaine.

Yeah i dont think i would quit my job for 5 BTC. Maybe take a nice long vacation around the globe instead. 
And how much to keep the gf secret from the wife? Just asking for a friend...

Just using the technology as a way of verifying votes and preventing voter fraud would be nice.

I have a coworker who says he bought 100 bitcoin a long time ago for $20. He's been going crazy lately trying to find info to recover it.

Just tell them it's a buyers market right now. Profit will come later.

I bought in at about $117.00 thinking it would go up to $130 again. I feel your pain.

Botters generally register multiple accounts and are contributing heavily to the constant (unintentional) DDOS of the site. I wouldn't be surprised if they are temporarily limiting it to one account per ISP address or doing something like that to throttle back their bandwidth a little until they can install more servers.
This is all just speculation though.
