If we can get enough upvotes, we can show Alex that they should incorporate this into their documentary as it would add a different outlook. I have private messaged him through reddit but no response so far. I am sure he will take notice if there are enough people showing interest.

I know the seller personally and as long as the proper paper work is submitted to protect them and they agree under the conditions... I don't see a problem as they have already have been charged and are currently awaiting jail time.

I agree with the balance of users.
I would say they are one of the og's, the forum is still filled with topics about their bust. Many users joined together to discuss how they miss a valued member of the community. On the best sellers/vendors list, there name pops up a lot. They would be considered one of the old school vendors as the site was starting to gain a lot of its popularity during that time frame. After there bust was confirmed, some members were looking to donate for their attorney fees too.

Go to blockchain.info, make an account there if you haven't already. Take your printed paper back-up and where you see PrivHexBe, enter the characters you have on there without a space on blockchain.info wallet import. This doesn't require the blockchain to sync on Armory Online.
