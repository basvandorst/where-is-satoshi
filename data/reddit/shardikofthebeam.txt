How does that work? If you know about it, you probably won't be selected. So if you don't know about it, and a case comes up where nullification makes sense, how does the jury even know it's an option to pass a not guilty (or guilty since it can be flipped around) based on the fact they don't agree with the sentencing?

Will, I would assume that your trial for conviction of perjury would happen on a separate date, with all new jurors.

Fair enough. I suppose for jury nullification to happen (legitimately, no one lying about their knowledge of it), it has to happen completely organically, with one person just saying, I don't think this is right and convince the other members of the jury of the same.
