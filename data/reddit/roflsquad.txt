Are there any updates? And why do you have to pay extra fees?
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:07:58
WTF is Ripple?
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:51:03
So changetip got a fee now for gifting? Great...
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:35:53
Where can I get litecoins??
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:48:17
Wow that's a great ad! 
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:04:53
Ah ok lol.
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:57:37
Two questions:
What should be different about ''Bitcoin 2.0'' in order to succeed?
And can someone ELI5 what the fuck Ripple is?
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:23:01
I hope it crashes to 1$ so I can buy about 80 of them and then wait a few years to get rich!
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:40:57
That's why I'm not at Sparkasse anymore, it's just a fucked bank...
@_date: 2017-02-13 13:03:13
What is happening in Venezuela? Can someone fill me in? 
All I know is that lots of people use Bitcoins over there.
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:07:23
Why are the transaction fees rising? Because everyone is competing to get into the next block?
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:03:24
That's a good point. I didn't know that the next halfening is already in 3 years.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:42:25
Why 2020?
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:27:44
Fucking hypocrates...
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:06:16
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:29:49
Thanks for your comment. I now understand the arguments much better.
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:05:08
Which currencies are better than Bitcoin and why?
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:57:19
And I feel bad for not buying more coins when they were around 200$ each...
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:18:58
What sub-network are we talking about? Just the one from Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:50:56
 RemindMe! 3 years
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:17:03
Did you actually give him a tip?
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:27:19
Fucking stupid advice. More people lose their coins due to losing their own (paper)wallet than from exchanges.
Had I kept my BTC on Kraken, I would have BCC now without the hassles of moving my shit to a second and a third wallet to reclaim it. But no, I was so stupid and listened to this subreddits advice.
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:01:03
Never tired of winning.
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:23:49
Nice it actually happnend like you said.
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:31:48
You don't get my point. The probability that kraken or coinbase get hacked or bankrupt is lower than something happening to your own wallet (be it hacking or losing the key).
If there is a simpler way than moving my assets to a second wallet (for BCC) and a third wallet (because with the second wallet you possibly reveal your private key) then go ahead and tell me.

Bitcoins are too expensive for me at the moment and I am happy with what I have already.
I bought etherums (is that how you say that?) because they are pretty cheap right now and I hope they will also take off in a few years.
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:47:52
2000$ 
Mark my words.
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:50:23
Holy sh*t, this is amazing! :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:01:14
Sprichst du da aus Erfahrung?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:13:05
So the banking system is my fault because I know about it, strong sense of logic right there.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:39:19
Please elaborate how the banking system is my fault?
@_date: 2016-02-12 00:48:37
Why is Authy dangerous?
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:58:20
Another shitcoin is just what we needed.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:52:27
lol, I'm pretty surprised that such a guy posts on reddit.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:08:10
Let's hope the servers of the exchange sites are ready this time.
@_date: 2015-11-25 19:39:26
Could someone explain this article for a non-native speaker? I don't get the whole point of the article. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:05:45
How do you guys know he has so many bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:22:22
I once read that someone paid 10.000 bitcoins for a pizza once back in the day.
There was also another guy who had like $900k worth of bitcoins on a computer, well, he dumped it on a garbage deposal bc he forgot about the computer after a few years.
Moral of the story: Don't ruminate about things you cannot change anymore.
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:46:56
I hate when such huge amounts of potential money are being moved and I get nothing from it.
@_date: 2015-11-06 00:37:20
nope haha
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:35:19
Isn't that what a bitcoin wallet is in microsoft's eyes?
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:08:51
Yeah, it's just stupid.
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:54:25
There is an altcoin hype at the moment. People buy Bitcoins to buy other cryptocurrencies with that.
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:07:58
This is so fucking stupid, so my private wallet can choose whatever blockchain I want (how does this even work???)
But when I leave them at coinbase I cannot just send the same coins to my wallet after August 1st? Did I understand this correctly?
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:29:12
I had a dream where I was in the game Assassins Creed and I could collect Bitcoins lying on the floor. I was very sad when I woke up.
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:21:46
What's Bitmain?
Edit: And what of those is bitcoin unlimited from the BTC subreddit?
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:40:23
Oh ok. Gotcha, my bad.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:05:09
Make me a millionaire please.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:35:29
Da fuck is a bitcoin tumbler?
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:30:35
I'm also thinking to move to Kraken because of shitbase. Can anyone recommend?
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:27:46
Should I move my assets from Coinbase to Kraken for safety reasons?? I also have a higher sell limit on Kraken, I think.
 I don't want to use a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:32:56
So if there's a hard fork I can decide on which side my bitcoins are???
