Bitpay, right? Or is my cold seriously impacting my reading comprehension?

While that's true, it's not really what Bitpay are offering here, is it? I'm pretty sure they're offering a service where the company pays them dollars and they give the employee bitcoin.

Can you substantiate the "not allowed to have a bank account" bit, or is it rumor? I wasn't aware of that and would love to have some facts.

I heard that's exactly what happened. So as long as you're dumping, I'll take yours at last year's rates.

Newbie question. How do we know how many BTC Satoshi has?

Thanks for posting this link. There's a thread there where  folks are discussing economics with In the past I've heard theory mostly from bitcoiners, so I find it really interesting to see both sides of the conversation represented there.

I know, right? Who tacks 4 satoshis onto an 0.5 BTC transaction? Just roll that dust into the transaction fee.

Seriously? I think you know different libertarians and geeks than I do. Because most of the ones I know have multiple significant others and love rope and S&amp;M.
