I'm sorry to beat a dead horse, but people use apps for their banks!
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:42:19
Yes, but they're illegal
@_date: 2017-02-25 07:56:29
Yeah, but most of the cash we actually spend isn't used on drugs. 
To me, it's irrelevant too (see u/). I was just replying to op
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:25:23
I think a lot of the places that accept btc aren't paying tax, otherwise how can they offer 15pct discounts with the volatility?
I've bought legal stuff. Not much proportionately, but some when there's an incentive.
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:26:12
Hahahaha, that's pretty damn funny. And now you can't get it off? 
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:35:59
You keep changing the goalposts to suit your agenda
@_date: 2017-02-24 22:24:01
Drugs and the odd pizza then ;-). Pizza is cleansing the btc
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:04:40
No, that's ok, I've been around a few years now. Been reading r/bitcoin for a few months r.e. the etf.
Drugs are the necessary evil that have given it its value. Who knows what it'll be used for next?
How is there a war on cash? You mean in America with spurious asset forfeitures?
My handlers? My banks? They are screwing me hard right now, believe me! They almost fucked me last year on a loan too when it was supposed to be a simple formality but ended up being dragged out for months.
One thing that I still cant work out with google and no one is answering.... I'm wondering if what I'm asking is rediculous or something. Do they actually spend any significant amount of btc in Asia, or is it just used for investments?
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:46:47
 &gt; you can pass around coins like it was fiat (think cash transactions, e.g. buying lemonade from a roadside stall ran by a little girl)

2cb is wonderful, in so many ways. Probably my favourite, but I wouldn't do it all the time. Anyways....
I think you're in the minority though. People aren't going out to buy btc to save a few pennies on groceries. They have the btc already for whatever reason.
Power and bills is interesting. However, I don't think what you've described has had any telling impact on the price. It'll be interesting to see if some gets spent in japan. Like you say, if you've already got the btc and it's cheaper there's no real reason not to use it.
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:53:11
Yes,  but all that would be redundant if it was only tied to a phone number. And only one exchange has been 'hacked', no?
What you're essentially talking about is a wallet, yes? 
I assumed by hard you meant complicated.
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:43:57
Apps are ubiquitous. You can put it on *any* phone.
You were saying that the reason it can't be adopted by the masses is because it's too complicated. I gave you the most common solution, that is most commonly known by the masses. You're saying, "but that's not secure", even though that wasn't the issue. And it can be secure anyway, easier, cheaper, *and* more accessible.
I didn't appreciate the tx comment. I own my own business. Look at my history.
@_date: 2017-02-25 04:46:57
The onion fields are blooming. No major exit scams or busts for over a year.
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:54:57
It's a free app on your phone.
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:24:00
But gold *is* divisible.
@_date: 2017-02-24 22:17:02
But, it *is* used for drugs :-/
Although it may dent confidence a tad, everyone knows anyway. It'd just be more publicity for the onion fields, which will help increase btc value.
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:58:22
It possibly is more secure but it's not as appealing imo. Or readily available.
@_date: 2017-02-25 12:20:15
Wow, that's incredibly scary. They'd riot in England over that.
@_date: 2017-02-24 22:26:01
Yeh man. Same reason Japan is doing that now. Our economies are intrinsically tied together.
That's still investing though. Do they actually *spend* any?
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:40:20
I can see where that's heading. Another phone down the shitter
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:38:14
That's got to be a probable outcome, no?
*Should* still be much cheaper than 3pct though.
Something will have to pick up some of the burden. It's unsavoury otherwise, despite being kinda delicious in a just desserts kind of way
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:18:41
That would gain access to btc on an app.
Stop clicking on stupid shit. Grandma of yesterday ain't built for this shit, never will be
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:17:05
That's what I thought. In the future hopefully they will spend it, as will we all. It wouldn't make sense to change it back to yuan if you don't have to.
@_date: 2017-02-25 14:16:32
You are also right.  Ultimately you only have yourself to rely on to secure your btc safely.  It's not guaranteed.  I think we're talking a few years down the line though, so who knows what the future may bring?
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:34:03
Hahaha. I've got hard teeth. Maybe you could make foil out of it?
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:13:16
Hopefully we will get to see what happens with Japan before I lay my life savings down?
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:03:55
Your original reply has no relevance to my post. Simply stating a fact that drugs have made btc what it is. Use whatever word you want. A point of view would be better so I can work out what message im failing to register
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:31:02
I don't know what's more universally adopted than mobile payments. Virtual currency is very popular in Asia, as is paypal, pingit etc.
Mass adoption right? People are idiots. I don't know why you'd assume I'm one though. You're woefully mistaken boy
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:21:51
I think cash is easier to steal than access to an app on your phone. And you were talking about ease of use anyway!
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:10:55
I just thought it was bizarre you'd say that to someone. Who wouldn't know what you meant? It's really condescending. But fine
There is currently no such malware.
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:06:17
The only hurdles are lack of acceptance and volatility. If people are fine to use apps for their bank, I think they'd prefer that. It's tied to them via their number. You saying you can get phished or hacked or whatever is yet to be seen. If that's the case then it'd just be made more secure.
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:23:24
If people have their life savings on there I'm sure they'd use whatever's most secure.
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:56:21
Yes, because I don't have brain damage.
