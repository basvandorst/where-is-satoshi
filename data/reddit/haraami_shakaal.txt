What's your source on this one ?  
One can possibly say they are also buying tons of bitcoins.

I have my funds on coinbase (not too much I have anyways), the reason behind it was being a noob, I thought CB will protect my funds better than me . I may do something stupid as losing the seed keys etc. But Now I think it's high time to do so.   
Do you guys have a noob guide on ho to safely transfer your funds from exchanges to hardware wallet?  
I am thinking of nano ledger s.

umm would  taking two ledgers justify given the fact that I don't have that much amount in crypto anyways?   
Also how can I initialize the second device with the same seed?   
I thought every device generates a unique seed.

Will surely read. Thanks

I feel you man.   
All those things we throw thinking of it in vain, and then after some time the stone turns into diamonds hits us pretty hard

I got nostalgic when you said the word "memory card".  
All these "bitcoin doom" posters magically disappears when the price starts to pick up again.

I just finished my first bitcoin transaction to purchase anything and came across this.  
It feels so great when you bought it lower and spend it now. Actually spending can be considered a hedge against bitcoin slumping down more to the more practical people. I personally feel bitcoin's worth is going to go way up.   
This feels so better than spending that fiat money, on which I have to pay late fees (credit card) if I miss a payment.  
Current use : 
Was going to purchase a flight ticket from Expedia, but looks like they stopped accepting the crypto payments way back. Then I went onto destinia, which accepts it as well, but looked shady so dropped that. So I went onto gyft and bought a $200 southwest coupon and voila.
