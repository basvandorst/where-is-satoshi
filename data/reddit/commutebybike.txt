Why don't you just do a chargeback?

Have you considered taking advantage of historically low interest rates on personal and payday loans to buy more bitcoins? Think of the returns you'll see. Smart investors use leverage.

This is a great idea, but have you considered taking out two of those $30k loans? You would be doubling your profit.

Whose side of this argument do you think your family is going to support? You downloaded some weird, possibly malware, app onto her phone and she took removed it because she obviously didn't want it there. If any of your family has heard of bitcoin they probably know of it in the context of how often it is used for laundering, drugs, and child porn, so your actions look even less justified. Not to mention the fact that it seems like you were trying to push a get rich quick scheme onto her. Nearly everyone has had to endure a pitch from a family member about a pyramid scheme or MLM, and that's what bitcoin sounds like when you evangelize it to your family members. You'd do best to apologize to your cousin and try not to become known as the weirdo in your family.

I just moved $500 from my Ally account to USAA. If I delete my USAA app, or even delete my online account, I still have that money there.
And if someone downloads an account onto your phone, and sends $500 to it, why would they expect it back?

In a word, euphoric.

If I delete the USAA app off my tablet I don't lose the funds in my checking and savings accounts. Maybe she is just used to dealing with  monetary systems that make sense.
