to be completely honest I find it odd that you waited 2.5 years to produce your first batch of PCBs.  


that is still a very generic information.

So in theory a malicious app on a compromised phone could get access to the PIN, with enough time guess what letter matches the other (to build a look up table) and all what would be needed would be a close contact with the NFC card.  
Thanks for the info!

Thanks for the link!  
So your system can be compromised if:  
- the attacker knows your pin  
- the attacker has access to the NFC card  
- the attacker took a picture of the security card  
Is that correct?

I spot:  
- a footprint for what seems to be a BLE or wifi transceiver  
- a connector for I guess a screen of some sort  
- 2 BGAs footprint, presumably for one ddr memory + one beefy microcontroller  
- footprints for battery management ICs  
- a slot for a beefy power connector  (i don't think USB)  
I'm not sure why these big traces are for RF cages... if so I'm not sure they're really needed.

Hello,  
I actually looked at the video.  
By security card, do you mean the card with the QR code?  
@_date: 2015-04-28 23:43:39
aha that would have been too easy!  
nice device! One could argue that FPGAs can be compromised as well...  
when will the sources be released? how long have you been working on it? There is a tremendous amount of work required.  
Also... who are you? the description was very generic

Quick question: would an hypothetical attacker with knowledge of the pin code (through the android app for example) and access to the ledger unplugged would have complete access over one's wallet?
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:03:12
I understand.  
Unfortunately the "vulnerabilities" I exposed could only be solved by having a pin code directly on the card itself.

if only I had known... thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2015-11-10 08:11:34
my guess ass well.

Out of curiosity, would buying a bwallet, desoldering the main IC, soldering a new one, burning the official bootloader and programming the official firmware work?

good article! It was a good surprise to see our product mentioned.
We hope to make a Mooltipass v2 with u2f support... among other things.
