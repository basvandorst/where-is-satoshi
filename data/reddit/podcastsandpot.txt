you're aware that some coins like nano are legit better than bitcoin when it comes to certain things, bitcoin simply dominates because it was the first crypto ever and has an insanely large first mover advantage

oh you were banned over there? good. you've been nothing but a source of negativity, everytime i see a comment from you it's never anything good, just constant vitriol and garbage coming out of your mouth. Maybe you should take this 30 day break to reflect on how you act
