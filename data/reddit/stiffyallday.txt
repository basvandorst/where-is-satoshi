I thought he was working for the Guardian and TheIntercept was set up previous to the Snowden leak? This is just going off of memory however.
Edit: Seems I am right about the last part. Whether or not Glenn was working for the Guardian I don't know.
Edit: I really should search before posting. Glenn was at The Guardian when it all went down.

I'm not sure about the dollar, possibly on a par, but don't think it passes it. Most countries in the world, the USD will get you far. I'm a Brit, but always take a few Dollars with me on my travels. All over Asia, South America, the Middle East, a lot of Europe, a few Dollars can get ya places/things that most other currencies couldn't.

Imagine that day... Times are changing and fast, hopefully see it in full swing within my lifetime.

Their .onion is garbage. Nearly impossible to get on there. Try refreshing the page or getting a new identity on TOR and trying again.

Circle. Use the app, lets you add a card and the transfer is instant.

So long as a warrant is signed, it doesn't need to be presented. 'Got a warrant for your arrest and laptop. Just warning you so you can run or remove usb from laptop m8'. Doesn't work like that.

Right, because you are the only person in this sub aren't you?

Someone could fall off a curb and Reddit will claim the person broke their hip, spine and skull. You can guarantee in every post where some injury can be caused, someone will take it to an extreme.
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:53:17
What if they had a warrant for arrest? They don't need to produce that, and once he is in custody, they can take the laptop as evidence. Simple. No malpractice, just the way it works.
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:47:13
Hahaha oh Reddit again with the broken necks. Broken necks everywhere!
@_date: 2016-06-30 12:40:52
God, that comment reeks of 16 year old.
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:14:31
And when was he charged with this conspiracy to murder?
@_date: 2012-11-15 16:47:56
Schweet, sound good man :)
Cheers fellas!

I've looked on there and the nearest one to me is selling at £7.99 per Bitcoin.
So I'm inclined to agree with you! How do you use that? Met him in person cash in hand, he sends to your account?
@_date: 2012-11-16 11:57:00
Yeah thats what I was thinking of doing! What sort of percentage do you pay for using Bitcoin Fog and Pingit?
@_date: 2015-04-29 07:31:43
Try bittylicious. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:52:52


Aside from any possible laws.


Millions keep credit cards. Unless you are pretty rich, you are a nobody and they don't give a fuck about you.


How do you know the merchant doesn't have a huge account with that particular bank or provider?

The criminal complaint states that the investigations in New York and Baltimore were independent, so I don't think they would have had access to each others evidence.
@_date: 2016-07-13 09:02:43
Source on that? As much as I would like to bash the government, I doubt they consulted just one bank, and then let them mop up the majority of the shares. They would have consulted plenty of people about the sale of the RM. 
Edit: Also the hedge fund operator only holds 6%... hardly majority of shares.
@_date: 2016-07-15 11:04:48
They might well have. But you said that they were the only ones to advise the RM, and the majority investor in them. Which are both wrong. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:03:49
Lots of info.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:31:42
Every chance. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose though.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:29:18
You say that in hindsight. In 6 months time, you might look back and say I'm glad I didn't sell coz you now own 10BTC and they are worth $400 a pop.
Who knows?

See if transferwise do a NOK -&gt; EUR and get them funds onto bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-04-05 10:50:31
I can vouch for Bitstamp via transferwire. My first exchange came through today, very simple, fast and seems reliable.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:32:53
No coz MtGox aren't trading.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:41:21
Transferwise and Bitstamp is where to start! Sign up for both, open up a bitstamp SEPA transfer deposit, then go to transferwise and enter in all of the correct info.
This then converts your GBP to EUR, so bitstamp can accept that, they then transer that to USD for your account. Using that you can buy BTC :)
Hope this helps.

Get over yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:31:04
It'll be back.

I think these guys were being investigated for a while before the take down, to do with activites not carried out online.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:13:19
Hmmm... Bullshit.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:56:35
No worries man, hope it helps.
EDIT: Also, look into paper wallets. Safest way to keep your coins. There is plenty of info on them here.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:35:38
Because it's the future and you don't know how it's going to pan out my friend. Why did you invest in the first place if that was your outlook?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:16:28
Yep, they weren't selling enough to justify having it there.
