I'm glad you enjoyed the writing, but I disagree with you regarding the misleading title. The content was very financial-oriented. Everything written was coming from my financial perspective on Bitcoin. Beginning with price, followed by the reasons for my bullishness, and ending with a comparison to our modern day forms of money and payment. Granted, you may have a point regarding the "Bitcoin Accepting Businesses" and "WARNING" section, but "no relation to the body of the text at all" hardly seems fair. We'll have to agree to disagree.

Did not realize that was how it was going to be interpretted. My apologies. The Title was actually the most difficult part to decide. I liked the sound of it so I went with it. My apologies for the inadvertent deception, it wasn't intentional!

They're inflated, yes - but they should still be considered. When the price rises, the buying comes from those Chinese sky-high volumes. You should take them with a grain of salt, but they are useful indicators. They still tell a story. It's just how you interpret them.

Thank you for the kind words. I truly appreciate that. They are more than enough.

Because I've been very confident in estimating potential prices before, only to get smacked in the face later. 
However, your estimation really wouldn't surprise me. Eventually, the current, stable, upward price trajectory will likely speed up, but nobody could possibly know exactly when, how high it will go, or how significant it will correct afterwards. It's just a guessing game.

I decided to edit the title to Bitcoin Optimist: A Financial Perspective; and I wanted to thank you for this. The title is much improved and I owe that to you, blk0. Thank ya.
