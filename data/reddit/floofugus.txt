How do we know you and your friends didn't stage the whole thing for attention?
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:29:53
Go troll someone else.
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:09:12
We're going to need you to tweet confirmation that you are legit. I think you're a lying scammer like your amateur hour leader.
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:15:53
You misspelled importance.
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:44:21
Why are you attacking me exactly?
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:38:00
Have you looked at his pick for education?  You support that??
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:11:32
You don't even need to attack his personality just objectively look at his history.  He is a disgrace to the United States of America.
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:52:43
No.  **Why do you support Trump now?**  Clinton is no longer an excuse.  Not saying it was ever a valid one.
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:51:31
Dude.  I'm not trying to hit in her.  I'm honestly as far away from interested as I can possibly be.  Stop hovering.
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:31:33
Seriously?  He lies, he cheats, he steals, he treats women like they are lesser humans.  I could go on for days but I'm mobile.
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:59:52
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:24:50
Why do you support that piece of shit?
Fairly certain you are a troll scamming for donations mods should remove and confirm
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:31:49
You misspelled important.
@_date: 2017-01-16 20:10:22
Ported your phone?
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:28:33
That was before the pboc action to limit leveraging 
@_date: 2017-01-29 19:30:22
I hodl 
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:34:16
Lying sack of shit.
@_date: 2017-01-16 20:56:14
You're just talking out your ass now.
@_date: 2017-01-19 00:25:42
Dark markets sell legal things too

Cloud mining is a scam you will always end up with more bitcoin by buying it directly rather than investing in a cloud mining scam.

Meth is bad
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:54:18
Been using Coinbase for 4 years without a single problem.
@_date: 2017-01-14 20:47:02
Good job
@_date: 2017-01-15 16:15:03
In addition to that why would they?
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:53:37
People also see small blocks as a strength.
@_date: 2017-01-16 20:08:07
If you're for small blocks then not moving forward is moving forward so both sides don't need to agree for one to get their way.
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:26:10
Argh paywall!
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:52:35
There is no risk in holding other people's money.  It's not like they're betting with it.
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:08:03
I prefer it that way.  If my account was ever compromised I would have time to stop the buy.
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:55:41
They want to protect us by telling the government more and than they are required to?  This is bullshit
@_date: 2017-01-29 05:02:32
Where can I find the mimblewimble code repository?
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:57:56
It's still just buried.
@_date: 2016-11-19 11:43:28
That makes no sense.
@_date: 2016-11-18 21:20:53


  
I feel like the world is getting infected with some crazy pill virus and I just haven't caught it yet.
@_date: 2016-11-19 11:45:29
We are certain about the monetary base.
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:13:55


  
the way I read it, they don't have access to cash.  It's not clear if spending electronically is limited.  Are there exchanges for Venezuelans
@_date: 2017-01-15 14:40:54
Congrats on throwing away money.
@_date: 2016-11-19 11:02:52
It's not removed unless deleted, good luck deleting the blockchain from existence.
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:08:58
Eat shit and die.
@_date: 2016-12-18 17:22:43
The price could go down as soon as you buy, if you are looking to hold long term like years I would buy it now.
@_date: 2016-11-19 12:04:36
On one hand you imply lost coins are a problem and the other you imply lost coins being found is a problem.  They're both just fine and are a part of what I signed up for.  I can't see a majority agreeing to change this.
@_date: 2016-12-18 17:20:51
Definitions evolve and vaporware cab used in a derogatory manner.
