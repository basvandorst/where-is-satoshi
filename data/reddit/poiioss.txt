What is good?

If your definition of long is 1 YEAR STRAIGHT your right.

Why wouldn't it be possible?
What a dumb question
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:43:47
Yeah, that dude doesn't know what he is talking about, we are heading to at least $1k

It's not even 10%, your maths are wrong, more like half that

Because Bitcoin lacks what any real currency needs; STABILITY.
Both the buyer and seller don't want to trade, the seller because he thinks it will go up in value and selling would mean a bad deal.
The buyer might think the contrary, buying is a high risk trade, because it could go down like 20% and last years to recover, if it even does anyway.
The most stable currencies in the world are backed by something more than just "trust".
Even the USD is kind of backed by oil.

You still use fiat currencies. Stop using the USD if you are so against it. Good luck using an asset as currency

Markets are moved by people, what a dumb sentence you wrote

It is just good business to buy now. Bitcoin needs to be almost dead to be reborn due to 2 things:
1. Killing weak hands like medicine kills the disease. We don't need people who don't believe in it, or even worse don't even know what the tech is capable of.
2. Kill shitcoins as much as possible. This is unhealthy for the crypto world because of the lack of "smart money". Useless coins, such as Dogecoin, are sucking the potential from other serious projects, like EOS, XLM, etc.
Once those people sell, and those shitty "projects" are dead, then be aware; the bear market end.
For possible "bottoms" no one knows actually, I predicted a bottom of around $2k for this to happen 6 months ago, based on my TA 8 months ago it should have been $4.5k. This encapsulates basically that no one knows where the bottom is, but... people who bought at the top 3 years ago are on the greens today.
In the long run we will win anyways.
Remember that, once everyone thought Bitcoin invincible then it fell, now people are thinking BTC is dead...
