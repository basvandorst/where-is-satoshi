If you don't like, I suggest you amuse yourself in another thread rather than start arguments here. &amp;

Yes it is. :D

I love everything about this. I'd be more than happy to help with it, if you like.

If you hate the thought so much then I suggest you take your own advice. Leave your negativity elsewhere. We have no time for it.

You're so mean. This is something that is incredibly fun (and empowering, in a way) that we, the women who post pics, have absolute control over.
Also, your rating system is flawed. LadyBytes is a gorgeous lady.

I think if this was answered you would still find something to hate about us. &amp;
It's a 'cooperative of women' because we women made it what it is. We run it.
And if you don't like the presentation, maybe instead of complaining about how it 'raises some flags', why not offer suggestions.

Hey, I'm up for it if she is! It does sound like fun...

I have to get this flair!

There was a bit of a shitstorm [here]( yesterday about it. At the time, stripcoin.com branding was in the banner, and listed a heap of times in the GGB sidebar.
It made the subreddit look cheap and tacky and commercialised, and us (the posters) seem like commodities - like we were generating all the business, when all we wanted was just to upload pics in a chilled, pressure-free environment.

Maybe not 'hate', sorry. But 'continue to find problems with'. 
Unless you don't, in which case, AWESOME.
