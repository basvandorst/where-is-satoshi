Nope, only really good support (most recently i had to wipe my phone and my Google auth wiped). They resolved my issue. I've had one loan that never repaid.

That's block data. You want the wallet.dat file.

Buy BTC from localbitcoins.com or another reputable site. Trade to altcoins on a crypto exchange. Dogecoin is due to be halved rewards on the 14th Feb. Sit on them and sell later.

This is what's killing the alt markets. No thanks! Stop producing your crappy clone coins.

They have created a superbank with China 
and their own alternative to visa/mastercard 
The USD is dead. Bitcoin is also illegal in Russia  but they still have the option to use it. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 13:19:54
Yes at  i have used these and paid with bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:32:40
I use both and i can say i have never had any issues. For a start try bittylicious 
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:18:45
Yes, It's switched off but you have the option to enable it or keep it disabled till the price rises and you make a profit. They are still being traded at around 0.00059987 per Gh/s
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:03:59
Some of us will still buy and mine ;)
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:14:10
One time yes. I was making profit but now i don't know if it's worth buying some to sit on while it's disabled and the price is low.

@_date: 2015-04-26 13:01:58
Woop! That's me happy they have added bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:05:06
You're doing a great job!
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:48:34
I think  does that. I use that to check on some of my bitcoin news.

Possibly a UK exchange. Once we break free from the EU and their stupid tax's and rules (not laws)
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:02:27
Yep, this. Let's escape away from using eBay and paypal. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:27:14

The datacenter where our servers are located is currently offline. We expect that this issue is resolved within the next minutes.
It's trustworthy, I've used it for a few years now.
