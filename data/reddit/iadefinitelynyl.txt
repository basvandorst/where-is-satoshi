Regardless of whether there is a criminal conviction, a civil forfeiture complaint can be
filed against any specific property, real or personal, that is subject to forfeiture based on the underlying
criminal activity. See generally Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset
Forfeiture Actions, 28 U.S.C. app. (2013). Civil forfeiture can even be used against a defendant who has
been acquitted of criminal charges. United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267, 277 (1996). However, if a
criminal defendant was convicted of a crime but prevailed during the forfeiture phase of the trial,
principles of res judicata would preclude a subsequent civil forfeiture action. Anyone with an ownership
interest in the property can challenge the civil forfeiture by filing a notice of claim, followed by an answer
to the complaint. Either the Government or claimants can demand a jury. See FED. R. CIV. P. 38. The
Government has the burden of proving the forfeitability of each property by a preponderance of the
evidence. Once this burden is satisfied, all interests in the property are forfeited unless claimants can
prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they were an innocent owner. 18 U.S.C. § 983(d) (2013).
To prevail on this defense, claimants who owned the property during the time period alleged in
the complaint must prove that they either had no knowledge of the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, or
that they took all reasonable steps to terminate the illegal conduct. Id. § 983(d)(2). Claimants who took
title to the property after the criminal activity occurred must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that they were bona fide purchasers for value without knowledge of the prior criminal activity. Id.

You can't defend yourself using someone else's Fourth Amendment rights.

They certainly can be. It just depends on how detailed and facilitative the instructions are.

It's only going to increase regulatory scrutiny and strengthen arguments against bitcoin if its only prominent uses are to buy drugs and facilitate prostitution and sex trafficking.
