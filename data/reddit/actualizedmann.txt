Well, I don't think we are in bull territory. 
I was up at 4am, and prices where like 5,800.
I've noticed last week around that time prices are low. 
I think we will be trading between 5.5k - 7.5k this week. If we get crash to 5k this week I'll see it as bottom. 
If no crash this week I think it'll be going 5.5k - 7.5k sideways until we go down t o 5k or up to 8.5k to break trend.
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:36:04
At 9.5 
And if we drop back down again I'll happily buy more at that range. 
But key is to remember to take out some profits at 11k - 12k

Congrats on the new house !

So this doesn't include my employer matching  401(k),  Including the 401(k) makes my crypto only like like 15% .
But yeah 401k isn't exactly liquid. 
So would you suggest in addition to stop buying crypto to invest in stocks or silver?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:25:48
I bought around 3.5k  bitcoin in January, and now it's  down to around 2.2k. 
Then I got into Robinhood in January. I can't buy crypto there yet but I bought $700 worth of stocks. APPL, GE, AMD, a few others.  I was up a bit but after Friday's drop, I'm down like $20. 
And I recently bought in to Silver  1oz rounds, mostly American Eagles. I bought with fiat but interesting to note places like apmex and provident metals accept btc for payment as well. 
I'm in around 34 coins (34oz,around $600ish). 
My investment plan:
* For BTC, hold for around a year where I'll be in the green,  take out my initial investment, access market to figure out what to do with profits. 
Might add 50-200 month.
*For stocks, regularly keep putting in 50 - 200 a month. Collect dividends, but otherwise stay in for at least 3 years. 
*Silver - Everything I'm buying is IRA eligible. My plan there is to have silver as a hedge against other investments, with flexibilkity to add to my IRA. It's also been almost a decade sense silver was at ATH, around $40 / oz. I'm In at 17$ ounce. 
If it goes to over 30 is possibly sell some.
Looking for advice on my plan above 
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:37:55
Like $150 only Lol.
Probably made that much buying on dip and selling on high in my trading portion of holdings 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:50:28
Thanks for positive sentiment!
So do you think bitcoin will hit 15k this year ?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:52:35
What is djia?
Yea, my silver is a hedge and i don't have an IRA yet, I'm buying only IRA eligible silver and will probably open IRA account this year 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:49:34
Thank you sir. If I had karma I'd give you some. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:36:17
Fair enough. 
But that still doesn't answer the question. 
What is your rationale for btc not hitting 15k by December 2018?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:29:52
You know "for a fact"? 
You have a magic ball ? Tell me than what will be bitcoin exact price at exactly 10:04am PST
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:07:39
I'm in the same ride with you. Bought in initially at 13k (usd). Made minor buys in 9-11 range. 
Today I  bought in at 6340. Helps even things out. 
I strongly believe we'll be at 14k by end of year 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:48:48
That makes sense. So is there any advantage in opening a vanguard account tho?
I can buy vti and other vanguard etfs via robin hood. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:53:31
Do you or anyone know the % of independent miners vs corporate miners?
Also,  unless corporate miners set it up so that they use there own electric grid with like wind generators or solar panels, I don't see how corp price per btc is much different. 
I'd be curious to know the price per btc for an organization making there own electricity that would be good info 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:30:32
Thanks man I appreciate the advise!
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:02:20
Damn man, DOW got hammered today. Btc did too . 
I'm happy I bought silver last week. 
I'm getting my tax refund this week. Thinking on what should I invest in, dow or btc 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:09:25
Gotta disagree. 
I don't think it will go below the price it takes to mine btc. Around 5.5k I hear. 
Calling 5k as the floor
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:32:11
Yea but it takes like 7 days to get funds from banking account in to coinbase (I use gdax for trading tho). So would have to buy like entire bitcoin at once at low 6k, and sell at 7k range . 
Eh it's possible in lots of ways you are giving me ideas. 
I've noticed at 3am -4am it's always lowest price.  Thinking on it 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:06:59
Thanks ;)
So question. If when markets go up, metals go down, and if markets go down, metals go up....
How does bitcoin fit in there ?
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:40:11
You and I each put 1k into an escrow account. 
If bitcoin hits 15,000$ in year 2018, I win. 
I get the 2k after it hts 15k. 
If bitcoin doesn't hit 15k in 2018, than on Jan 1st, 2019, you get 2k. 
Details we can hash out. Would you be in ?
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:21:31
Well well, looks like we are over 8k.... guess no pumping and dumping 
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:21:08
Originally bought in at 14k. As price plummeted I bought in a little at 12k, 10k, 8k, and 6k, wherre I got in good amount as felt like it was bottom. 
I finally have some profits and used it to buy silver bullion. New age meets old school
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:13:44
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:27:04
Oh ok I know what the DOW is 
Of i buy silver when DOW is at 25k, and DOW goes to 30k, I see how that means silver will go down. 
But u think I bought silver at perfect time. I bought early last week.  And now there is a stock market correction happening.
Plus I got American Eagles at only like .50cents above spot ;)
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:24:35
Well well, looks like it went to 8.2 over the night.
What do you think prices will go tyo today 
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:34:19
If stocks continue downward trend next week, and btc stays sub 10k, thoughts on investing in silver &amp; gold?
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:35:36
If at 3-4am pst the price is under 6.5k, I'm going to start pumping and dumping small amounts. 
650 in, 780 out, extra hundred side income....
This probably what the 20% of you guys who aren't idiots are doing anyhow 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:00:07
Nah. 
I was at 6 hour meeting at work, I just checked the dow,  and btc prices. 
I have to analyse my position overall. 
One bright note is I bought some 32oz of silver last week. 
After today I think we both cab agree that btc prices can go anywhere this year 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:46:43
I can use robin hood to buy etfs I see now. Vanguard I can buy there. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:48:16
Bitcoin will need to hit 14k ish for me to break even, and at 15k I'll be in some green. 
You don't think it'll go to 15k this year ?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:46:36
I need a work on  
 I'm spot on.
Why have a HSA? If I already have good ppo. 
Where can I find more info on Roth IRA, and etfs?
Why should etfs be 85 - 90%?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:43:21
So here is link (note, this isn't referral link or anything just explains IRA bullion), go to provident metals. Com. Go to IRA section. 
In short I make sure the types of coins I'm buying are IRA eligible , I having started IRA with them yet, but it's a nice option to have for when I'm tired of looking at the shiny coins. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:41:12
That sounds like a 401k. O suppose they are different investment vehicles. 
So why would etf be better than using robin hood to buy individual stocks of my choosing?
Especially cause robin hood has 0 fees...
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:28:17
Is there minimum required when signing up for etf?
And is it liquid/ can one withdraw funds without penalties 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:07:31
Today's sec meeting is causing a bear trap!
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:20:19
I bought in at around 4am at $6370 ish. Bought .1 btc  
I can short it to make a quick $100 buttttt I don't know if it's going to be low 6k again
