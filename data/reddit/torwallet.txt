Our service mixes your coins with those of other users. Shuffling coins around on your own machine is easily traceable with the blockchain.

We suggest emailing the link to yourself. The whole point of the service is so that we have the absolute minimum amount of information about you, a username, email, or password are possible traceable in the unlikely event our server is compromised.

Infact, here is the only thing special about our vps. You're welcome to try it yourself and run a mirror.
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:443,fork,su=nobody,reuseaddr,verify=0,pf=ip4,cert=/etc/socat/server.pem SOCKS4A:127.0.0.1:nci2szjrwjqw2zbi.onion:80,socksport=9050

Both other laundry services I am aware of also suggest that you store some coins there. Storing increases anonymity because those coins are mixed additionally and it is harder to link transactions separated by time. It'd be pretty easy for us to get caught as well. We have already gotten complaints from people expecting their balance to update with javascript like instawallet and have edited the site accordingly. If you know of a web of trust that we could be a part of please let us know.

TORwallet is an anonymous bitcoin mixer and wallet service. Our clearnet site is hosted on a throwaway VPS and consists of a static website and tcp-to-socks proxy.
Visit us through Tor at  or on clearnet at

We are using bitcoin to pay for hosting and registered through tor with a tormail account. The torwallet.net server is a proxy to the .onion only. It is set up in the same way tormail.org is, their abuse policy applies to our service perfectly. 
We're not willing to disclose very much about the server hosting the actual website, but it is off-shore and not associated with the email used to register the VPS in any way.
