Your naiveté is embarrassingly obvious. Your claims are backed up by terms and ideas I'm not sure you fully understand.
Posts like this are exactly what makes the crypto community a joke to the rest of the world. The ideas and technology behind crypto are profound. You and your insights are not. Stop conflating the two

Shit man, you sound like you know what you're talking about. I took out as much as the bank would let me in loans (around ~25k) and invested 90% BTC 10% across some other coins I like. The dollar will be worthless, then everyone's fucked, and all hodler's will be saying "told ya so". I pity these idiots who actually believe in the dollar. Bitcoin more like bitKING.

I think it'd be nice for your ego to experience a bit of deflation. You have no idea what you're talking about
