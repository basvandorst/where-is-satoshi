It genuinely was... He's known for playing around on bfx.

Inspires the bulls to buy, shifting the bag and creating enough demand to off load coins. If you have a big amount you need bids and lots of them to dump into believe it or not. 
Weak to strong some look at it. At the minute I feel it's clever to dumb.

Ohh the fear... Oooooh the despair... 
I have made so much profit. omfg.

He died man. Everyone knows that. Stoshi Nikkimotor, right?

Whilst I am bullish on bitcoin long term, I'm also someone who sees another global crash like 07 as undeniably bad for bitcoin. 
I simply cannot see people to rush to put money into this asset when everything is falling to shit and people need money for the basics of living. 
We'll see when the next crash inevitably happens. Maybe it's like the Silk Road 1.0 crash, now wouldn't that be awesome.

Or just do 26 and get a heads up on how the 28 and 30 will look...

So is he selling gox coins here?... The 30k coins were spotted in a block yesterday and had previously went through an SR coin mixer. So suspicious!
It would explain why he doesn't mind cashing out so much at 300, he's already 3x his money.

I think he means that in the literal sense. You're thinking into this too much 
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:55:42
People still use this junk site?
@_date: 2015-01-24 07:53:23
Proper fucked. Can confirm.
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:11:02
Yes they most likely will

A group of 3. Identified on the books a long time ago in the 600s as bearwhale, and yes, they are real. Quote "how can you lose 50x when you know the direction the market is going." 
Short it from top to bottom with as much leverage as you can, drive price lower and lower, squeeze out all those shitty companies, weak hands, miners, early adopters. The year of the bitcoin cleanse. All the while market makers make a fucking killing and increase their holdings by an order of magnitude.

so fucking funny

You'll both be in a box who cares :D

After a top is in (hint: monumental crash and epic bounce during a few weeks) just short and forget. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 15:43:02
Thanks :)
