It's great how the guy running CoinATMRadar.com continues to promote these guys' companies (BitExpress &amp; MetroBTM) and continues to take money from them for advertising on his site.
Weeks ago, he was presented with these facts by operators who have been victim to the Konja brothers' crimes and his response was basically that he doesn't care. Of course, he is still getting paid, but we should all just ignore that slight conflict of interest.
His entire position on this, and everything else that generates revenue for him is that as long as they keep paying him for advertising, he's more than happy to keep advertising their business. As long as the operator of CoinATMRadar keeps making money everything is good.
Hey why don't you share how much you make in advertising every month? Would love to see an article about that. You're so quick to write articles about how much everyone else is making in the space, but you won't even reveal your name or how much you're making from all the bitcoin ATM companies that you charge.
I would ask you again to do the right thing and remove from your map any operators who resort to these sort of criminal methods to compete, but you already chose to ignore that in favor of the money that you make.
Just another day in bitcoin I suppose.

$5 USD = approx. Bs. 50. The article states that it is limiting customers to Bs. 10,000 per day, which is closer to $1000 USD....unless I'm missing something?

this article is wrong on so many levels. written by a guy living in Switzerland who has never ran a bitcoin atm business and just extrapolates small amounts of data to write articles which get him more pageviews. just annoying to see someone pretend to be an expert and write stuff which is so inaccurate. but he's making money from all the ads on his site so gotta keep the clicks coming.
