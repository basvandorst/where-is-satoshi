If it is your money, then who cares if your parents think it is a good idea? It doesn't matter. Just buy it, and don't tell them. You have a few options to do so.
You can buy bitcoin locally with Mycelium wallet for android. It has a peer to peer trader app. You could also try craigslist (be very careful). Better yet, find a local bitcoin meetup on meetup.com and attend. You will find others to talk about bitcoin with, and someone there will sell you some. Localbitcoins is also an option, as mentioned below.
One of the greatest things about bitcoin, is that if you try hard enough, no one can stop you from getting it, and using it. Be creative.
@_date: 2014-09-24 04:19:21
This is true for the most part. Craigslist deals are really not that scary, but not without risk.
There was that one story though.. Let me see, cannot find the link. Basicly a guy setup a craigslist deal and the seller accepted bitcoin. They met, he checked out the item agreed on a price, sent the bitcoin and waited. The seller then picked up the item and walked away. This was in a public place, and the buyer only had a couple of bad choices at that point. 
This illustrates the true danger in a face to face transaction. Without an escrow of some sort, one party or the other will at one point be forced to act first. Be it hand the money over, or send the bitcoins. The party whos acts first is in danger of being ripped of, even if only for a short time.  You can mitigate this risk however. More on that in a moment. 
At this time, I can only imagine how filing a police report about being robbed in a bitcoin transaction will go. Officer: "So let me get this straight. You sent him "bitcoin", a imaginary digital coin and he didn't give you the cash?..." This will change in time I imagine, but even now police do not devote many resources to those who have been robbed. 
Back to mitigating risk in a face to face transaction. Whenever meeting a stranger for a cash deal you should be aware of your surroundings. Always meet in a public place. Go with your gut. If you have a bad feeling about someone after meeting them, follow that.

What the above poster days is true, and this is the reason rational folks only invest what they can afford to lose. Since you are spending money you would have blown on cigarettes each day, this is money you can afford to lose, and thus the ideal way to invest in bitcoin. Any one who is long on bitcoin will agree that the potential upside is so much larger than the potential downside.

Be sure to check the BTM (Bitcoin ATM) rate. Many are bitcoinaverage +12% or more. I was speaking to the owner of a local BTM and seemed to think 12-18% was avg mark up. 
For comparision, coinbase is 1%. Consider also that most US based BTM's are going to be doing some degree of KYC (Know your customer). 
You may wish to check out Mycelium for android. It is a bitcoin wallet that allows for peer to peer trading. Rates in my area seem to vary from +3% and on up. Love this app! It offers encrypted chat between you and the other user to facilitate the meeting.

 That seems a small price to pay to avg out your buys over each day vs only once per month or week. You get the best averaging this way. In terms of btc price volatility I think this fee is negligible.
@_date: 2014-12-14 23:24:08
[Mycelium]( wallet for android has a peer to peer exchange built in. If you have users in your area, you can usually buy / sell for around a 5% premium. Sometimes less, or more, it is set by the users. Once you initiate the transaction you are then able to communicate with the other party over an encrypted chat. This works great, and is much less traceable than LBC. 
Paying 15% on local bitcoin is very high. If you are willing to walk into a bank branch and deposit money in an account you should be able to get a MUCH lower premium. 
You could check for a local meetup in your area. There is almost always someone willing to sell BTC at those. 
Also craigslist is an option.
As for the guy staring, he needs to mind his own business.
It is not super easy to buy bitcoin currently, but it's not nearly as hard as it used to be. The reason it is hard at all is 100% KYC laws. If it were not for those, then there would be many many way to buy bitcoin easily.

This. It merely opens a compatible bitcoin wallet with the payment address pre entered. It does not send the payment, or commit you to anything.
Not sure what that is you linked to. URI for the purpose of writing a tag is an option you choose when you are in your tag writing program. In the NFC TagWriter by NXP the steps are as follows:
Open program
Select "Create, write and store"
Select "New"
Scroll down to the bottom
Very last option is URI (Not there is also a file URI option, don't choose this)
Once you have selected URI in the "Enter URI" box (second one) type the following:
bitcoin:[your wallet address here]
Click next (might have to lower your keyboard)
Click next again
Hold your nfc tag to the back of your device
You should hear a sound
It will say 
Result: Store successful
That's it, you are done.
You can now hold the newly written nfc tag to the back of your device and see it in action. 
Let me know if you have any more questions.

The number of bitcoin addresses is more than the diameter of the universe expressed in zeptometers (1 zm = 10-21 meters)
to quote Douglas Adams: "Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we're trying to get across here."
and from 


Now consider a private key address where each character has 62 possibilities. 62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x6262x62x62x62x62
Trust me when I tell you that the possibilities are truly endless. The number of private addresses is so absolutely large that you'll never stumble upon the same address twice unless you know how the original private key was generated.
If everyone on the planet generated thousands of addresses it would still take all the computers on the planet thousands of years to guess one of them.

Now that is an interesting question. I have never tried this. My initial thought it that there is no need. If you programmed the tag with the public address of your cold storage, you could then send funds to the offline wallet without the need to have mycelium open up with the cold storage option.

It provides no way to backup the data. Lose your phone without having all your secret keys and you have a very big problem. 
I used to use it with a encrypted backup via titanium backup. This method has several flaws. Not the least of witch being that if I added a new app and didn't rebackup I was screwed when I wiped my phone. 
With authy I can sync my backups (encrypted) to any device I want, even if I lose my phone. Add to that you can use it on a pc. Winning :D

* The 21 million BTC limit means simply that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins mined. After that no more bitcoins will ever be created. We will reach the limit somewhere near the year 2140. Does that help?
* You are correct in saying that it is not very practical for the average consumer to use .00000015 BTC in common parlance. To combat this there are other ways to express the amount of bitcoin you are speaking about.
Most common are miliBit and microBit








* The relationship between cryptocurrencies like dogecoin and bitcoin is similar to the relationship between the US dollar to the Euro. They are both currency's. 
Each cryptocurrencies operates on it's own blockchain. You can think of a blockchain as a digital ledger, or record keeping book. Though they all use one, they do not use the same one.
So no, they are not part of the same pool of coins. Each has a different pool.

There are lots of good suggestions in this thread. One more thing to note that is very important. Make sure you use 2FA on EVERY account that has anything to do with bitcoin. This includes circle, and the email address you used for circle. 
Best practice is to have a email address just for bitcoin related things, with 2FA setup, and don't use that email for anything else. 
If you are syncing backups to the cloud make sure they are encrypted backups. If you upload an un ncrypted backup to the cloud, anyone who gets access the it (NSA?) can easily steal your coins.
Additionally if you go with paper wallets (most secure arguably), make sure you use encryption and store the backup in at least two physical locations. 
You can check out  for how tos on making a secure offline paper wallet.

Speculating that the people donating assume that if he gets more personally involved that he will continue to promote bitcoin on his show and keep bringing people in. Just speculation though.

Hash rate does not directly affect how the bitcoin network functions. It is designed to auto correct and stay on track with a long term focus. 






The chart does not copy well to reddit, but if you scroll down the page you can see a historical list of difficulty / hash rate / date.
As recently as the beginning of August the hash rate was half what it is currently. A -1.37% change is a drop in the bucket. 
I really wish that chart went back to the genesis  block. That would be very interesting.

If you are buying them anywhere but from bitmain you are likely overpaying. 
Bitmain has very good pricing, and fast shipping. 
Now whether or not buying a miner is ever going to get you to ROI, that is debatable. Personally after doing the math, I don't see any scenario where it is not better to just buy bitcoins with the money you could have spent on the miners. 
One thing is for sure. It is not easy to make money mining. If you have free electricity that does help.

[An Open Letter from Tristan D'Agosta](
Dear Poloniex Community,
I wanted to take a moment to address some of the feedback we have received with regards to the recent changes at Poloniex. There are a fair number of rumors circulating around on social media, and I'd like to try and separate fact from fiction.
We are a Money Services Business (MSB). Accordingly, we are bound by the rules and regulations defined by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and regardless of how other businesses operate, we are legally obligated to follow the rules of FinCEN to the best of our ability.
Starting on May 21, 2015, we will require your name and country for all withdrawals. To withdraw more than $2,000.00 USD equivalent within 24 hours, we will require your address and phone number. It is only if you need to withdraw more than $7,000.00 USD equivalent in a 24-hour period that we will require identity verification such as your social security number or photo ID. We are taking these measures to protect ourselves and you from potential criminal activity that could force a shutdown of our services.
To be clear, any and all profile information we collect from you is collected in order to be compliant and to discourage people from using Poloniex unlawfully. None of the recent changes are to share or sell your data for marketing or advertisement purposes.
While we are saddened by customers who have threatened to cease using Poloniex as a result of these changes, we have chosen the unpopular path of following the regulations that apply to us because we believe it is the right thing to do. We are grateful to our loyal customers who will continue to use Poloniex as we grow and innovate.
It is unfortunate that the changes to our withdrawal policies have overshadowed the incredible work the Poloniex team has done to bring Margin Trading to the altcoin community. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the amount of Margin Trading activity we have seen in such a short period of time, and are excited to be a part of this new era of alt trading.
Tristan D'Agosta

Quantum computing breaking encryption.
A government or multiple governments would not cause it to fail. Set it back years perhaps decades, yes. 
A government or other organization that has enough money and was felt threatened enough could. It would be difficult. They could develop a new generation of mining hardware in secret that beats or is on par with the best in production currently. Then mass produce enough of these units to gain 51% of the network hash power and use that to play havoc. Any one doing this would spend a fortune. If the sole goal was to break the network, and they planned and had very deep pockets, it could be done. Unlikely fit sure, but it is possible.

@_date: 2014-10-14 20:17:07
Kudos to you good Sir!
Moving this amount of fiat into BTC is not extremely easy right now. Best solution I have thought of, is to link up with a local OTC (over the counter or face to face) trader of BTC. Having someone local that could meet with your client and sell them BTC in person could really help you with this process. How you hook up with this person in the first place is another problem. I might try to find a local bitcoin meetup in your area, and ask around. 
Best of luck!
EDIT - I just thought of another idea. You might try to contact coinbase or circle directly and explain to them your problem. Perhaps they would be able to work out a custom solution for you.

Can you elaborate on that? 
When you send a tx from any wallet you control the private keys to, you broadcast your tx to the bitcoin network. This requires no third party. 
While it does seem to follow that if you were mining you could force your tx to be included (though I don't know logistically how you would do this), I don't see how this translates to running a node.

I have never used them as a merchant. My understanding is that you can use either to send invoices. To manage your company's income, that I doubt. It would easy enough to enter each invoice into quickbooks or something like it. So it may not be exactly what you are looking for, but will allow you to start accepting bitcoin as a payment option right away with little setup. 
They both have been known to deploy custom solution for customers. I would contact them directly and see if they can help you.
@_date: 2015-01-30 06:56:02
It can easily be more expensive. You would be paying twice to exchange it to and from fiat.

Another option is to use titanium backup (requires root) and backup the app. Restore this backup on new phone. Also useful to have your google authenticator on two devices. 
Note - If you do use titanium backup, DO NOT upload your backups to google drive! A wallet backed up to google drive is a huge security risk.

@_date: 2015-01-16 04:22:32
This is method is not cold storage. You have essentially created a hot wallet of sorts. More importantly, you are lucky that you only tried this with mycelium. Many wallets don't handle change addresses well, and that results in potential for loss when using a paper wallet without sweeping. I believe mycelium is written so that it ensures the change address is the paper wallet, but if you try this with a wallet that does not do this, the coins are sent to an address you do not have the private keys to. 
Best practice is to use a new paper wallet any time you remove coins from one. Mycelium can be a very safe hot wallet. If you have the seed written down, a pin on the app, and one on your phone, you have little to worry about. Even if you lose your phone, with these things, you can recover your coins long before anyone could hope to brute force their way into the wallet to move them.

Every device I have the can read a NFC tag, can also write one. Not all tags are equal. There are some that are not compatible with newer devices.
The easiest way to answer your question is to get a hold of a tag and try it. 
What device do you have?
I ordered these tags:
They work with everything I have thrown at them. Beware there are very similar looking tags around that are the older style, and its hard to tell them apart.

Mycelium is great if you have other people in your area that use it. 
Coinbase / circle seem to be the top reccomened one these days. Both follow know you customer laws. 
You could also try craigslist or similar local site.

Weird. I have two open orders  on purse for gift cards. Just checked, they were not canceled. Wonder if they will go through. 
EDIT - Both orders went though.
@_date: 2015-07-12 00:50:34
Of course purse will work as normal. The problem you may have is timing. If a sale sells out while you are waiting for someone to take your offer you are going to be out of luck.
Edit - work = luck

I am not sure if it works in Canada but you might look into bitwage.com . They are a payroll service that allows you to be paid directly in bitcoin. After that getting USD shouldn't be too difficult.

"Bitcoin" the currency could fail arguably, but the idea and the tech behind a "trustless" currency is out, and ideas can not be killed.

Now take your coins and move them to a wallet you control. You must always remember; "If you do not control the private keys, you do not control the bitcoin."
While your coins are on circle, they control them. Moving them to a wallet you control means you have to take responsibility to secure them and, more importantly, they are yours and no one can change that except you (intentionally or unintentionally). 
Be sure to back up said wallet. If you are on android [Mycelium wallet]( is a great choice.
