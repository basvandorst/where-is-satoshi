@_date: 2019-10-12 03:17:24
THis argument can be extended at any price point. It leads to the position of "better keep all my bitcoins until I am dead, then I didnt lose anything".  Furthermore, when you sell an asset for $100 and it goes to $500 you didnt lose $400.

They have a nice order process that is internal, not a payment processor. Price they give for btc was fair market as I could figure out. They give you an address with a 15min window when you order with the the amount in BTC to send. Zero hassle, used 3 times now.

Lots of people on the subreddit are 17 year old idealists wearing rose colored glasses. Of course your concerns with the power structure actually allowing bitcoin to be defacto base value monetary instrument are valid. As for money laundering you are wrong.

The position is reasonable. But why not consider bitcoin to be a means of electronic funds transfer replacing paypal/visa/swift? That's how I look at it, not the great solution to usurp the "bad guys". At its root its a protocol to securely transfer digital value without a centralized authority you have to trust. I see a utility in this and thats why I think bitcoin is worth a risk in investing in, you dont need to be an "anarcho-capitalist" to believe in bitcoin having a productive use-case.

 If its not worth mining they stop mining and the difficulty decreases.
@_date: 2019-09-17 00:43:50
 If the price point is way above cost of production they sell, if it's way below they hoard or even buy. Executing this strategy long term, (under the assumption they are in it for the long term which huge operations must be), they make even greater profits than just mining and selling.

Try sweeping the key using blockchain.info.
if you know how to run python scripts from terminal you can use pybtctool.
The command 'pybtctool privkey_to_address &lt;insert private key here&gt;' should output the address where the coins are held. If there is an error the private key is invalid.
