So if bitcoin becomes large enough, it will eventually end up like normal currency? Commonly used and heavily regulated because the government will probably step in sometime.

I fail to see how this wont turn out like a regular bank.

I think we can compare breach of security between credit/debit cards and bitcoin to Macs vs. PCs (virus wise). 
Majority of the people in this country use some sort of debit/credit card to make purchases, and a very small minority have bitcoin. There is more money to be made by breaching the credit card networks because most people use them. You're catching small fish if you're just tapping into bitcoin users.

But if something happens to your account, the banks have fraud departments to get your money back.

In the event that someone figures out how to steal your bitcoin, you're screwed. Reverse the charges? Nope. You're money is gone.
With a credit card, you can get the charges reversed. Same with a debit card, but it's just a PITA to get done.

I'm genuinely curious as to what would prevent a bitcoin bank from turning into a normal bank? Especially since part of the movement was to keep banks out of it...

I've seen numerous posts/threads about bitcoin going "missing"...If there is a will, there is a way.

See, this is leading to my point. This seems to be starting out like other forms of currency. The government will eventually get a hold of it and you'd be back at square one.

What about lending and all the other services banks provide? Also the fact that banks are insured by the FDIC?

This exactly. I work at a bank, and dealt with a few people who were affected. Charges get reversed? Absolutely. Waive the fee of a new card and expedited shipping at no cost to the client? You bet I did. Are they losing any money at the end of this? Nope. 
Get your life savings of Bitcoin stolen? You better reincarnate and begin life all over again.
