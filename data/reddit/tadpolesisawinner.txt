ACTUALLY BRO, you can exchange them for gift card value immediately, then buy something at that store.  If you want to exchange them for USD, it takes a while, you can't just exchange them for USD if you're at the mall, you gotta sell those fuckers then transfer them to your bank account then wait for all that shit to happen before you can use them, BRO!

I don't think tracking presents a risk.  It's just a preference.  It will be legal in Washington State to buy MJ from stores (starting in Dec), but that doesn't necessarily mean I WANT a record of my purchases (especially since it's still illegal federally). So cash or BTC would be great for that.

Basically what the message means is you'll get the amount of BTC that is equal to what the USD ratio is on Monday.  So if you deposited $100, if 1BTC = $50 on Monday, you'll get 2BTC.  But if 1BTC= $200 on Monday, you'll get .5BTC.  Not sure which is better :-)
However, for a certain amount of BTC each morning I believe they give the buyer the rate of the time that they ordered.  It just depends which one of those options you got hooked up with.

You're wrong.  You collect a proportionate amount of dividends with the amount of micro shares you own.  At least this is the case on HavelockInvestments and I would expect btct to be the same.
Source: I owned 50 micro shares last week and DID receive a divided.  Enough to buy 1 more micro share, actually!
Edit: Also, to answer Rhawk's other question, they are deposited into your balance and you can cash them out or use them to buy more shares.  They're usually announced Wednesday and received Th or F.

Yeah, I don't really attribute it to Webmoney or Mt. Gox.  That news seems too old to be pushing it.  My best guess is all the new VC's investing in bitcoin startups, though that's not the "newest" news either.  Maybe it's just the fact that people heard about it a week ago and it took about a week for them to learn about btc, where to buy it, etc before they were able to?  Also, Coinbase seems to be the easiest way to buy btc in the US without having to wire transfer shit, and it takes like 5 days for Coinbase to process btc.  I'm not sure if that is a factor.  Maybe a shitload of people bought on Coinbase last week and they're just now getting their coins?

OK, I think I'm getting it.  So let's do this, purely hypothetical as I know Best Buy doesn't accept BTC, nor do they sell cocaine, so, hypothetically:
Best Buy is a huge organization.  If they had a BTC address it WOULD be well known, right?  So let's say the DEA found a gram of cocaine in the mail, addressed to me with a Best Buy return address.  They could ask Best Buy what BTC address did you receive the payment from?  They would give the DEA my BTC address.  But I've transferred those coins from 3 other previous addresses.  They check those 3 previous addresses and see that on one the BTC was transferred from a Coinbase address.  Couldn't they then get a warrant for Coinbase to give them the info on the person who bought the coins for that address?  Then if the person who bought those coins matches up with the person to whom the cocaine was delivered, it would be a pretty strong case?
So, yeah, I'm just wondering because it seems like eventually they could make a computer program that could easily link BTC purchases with Coinbase purchases by going backwards through the blockchain. 
Like shit, even if there were 5000 blockchain transactions that linked the purchase at Best Buy to the purchase at Coinbase, wouldn't the odds be miniscule that that was just coincidental?
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:31:39

I do this exact same thing. Easy paper wallets can be printed out at papercoin.org, created by a r/bitcoin user I believe. Just print out a wallet, transfer BTC to the wallet address, and viola, you have an offline paper wallet. Takes 5 min max. To put your BTC back online, you just go to your blockchain account and enter the private key. Easy as pie. I haven't tried armory or any of that stuff because, though it may be easy, it can't be as easy as this. Disclaimer though, don't use a paper wallet again after you've used the key. Any remaining funds you'd like to transfer offline, just make a new one. Super easy.

I was going to post this the other day.  I've been checking Coinbase for a while.  A couple weeks ago, if you wanted to buy at current market price, you'd have to catch Coinbase like at midnight pacific time.  If you tried during the day you'd have to buy at market price whenever your transaction went through.  Since they got that 5 mil, I've been able to buy at market rate all throughout the day.

I don't think even the most passionate (and intelligent) BTCers think BTC will EVER replace USD.  But I do think that they think BTC could COMPLEMENT the USD, enough so that perhaps it makes up 1-10% of USD transactions eventually, and possibly 1-10% of transactions in the world, which would make 1 BTC between $100,000 and $1m.

Bitfunder is probably the hardest because they have an intermediary called WeExchange that you have to send your BTC to first, then to Bitfunder.
btct.co is pretty easy.  I personally like the look of havelockinvestments.com the most, but they have the least diverse companies (currently only 5, though 2 of them, ASICM and HIM, are popular and Satoshi Dice used to be pretty popular).

Yeah, he means an ASIC MINER shareholder, not a bitcoin "shareholder." 
You can buy ASIC shares here: havelockinvestments.com
This place is cool because you can buy partial shares, so you don't need to buy full shares at $140 or whatever they're at.  Another cool thing about owning shares is this:
Each ASICM share has the right to 95% of its respective dividends. 5% will be retained for asset management fees. The amount of the dividend is defined as the same amount distributed by ASICMINER to the shares held by the issuer for this asset. Dividends will be paid within 48 hours or less of confirmed payments from ASICMINER.
and this:


Once the passthrough reaches 5,000 whole ASICMINER shares (500,000 split shares) it may receive a board member seat. If board member status is confirmed, and Friedcat follows through with the plan to give each board member a trial ASICMINER mining board, any income generated will be shares as follows:

What I don't get about Bitspend...
Here's how I think it works, please correct me:  I have 2 BTC.  I give Bitspend 1 BTC, they convert it into USD and buy something from Best Buy for me.  Then I purchase 1 more BTC.  Now I have 2 BTC again, and my Best Buy purchase.
How is this better than just keeping my 2 BTC and buying the item from Best Buy with cash?  Is it?  What is the advantage?  Are we hoping Best Buy sees that the funds were transferred from Bitspend and decides to accept bitcoin in the future because of all the Bitspend transactions they see?

Honestly, with all the $ in BTC right now, I don't think we need to do shit. The 28k who are subbed to used to be a pretty big chunk of the BTC owners.  Now we're not even close. Of course there's shit we CAN do to help, but right now there are too many people in on this shit.  We don't NEED to do anything.  This shit is just gonna have to play out now. We CAN help it along a little, but BTC is it's own monster now and we need to just trust the fundamentals behind it to take us the rest of the way.

You know, honestly, when Microsoft blew up, it wasn't investors that had degrees in Econ and Finance that benefited.  It was just people like you and me who thought "You know what, computers are the future".  I had a substitute teacher who taught just because he was pretty much retired from his Microsoft stock.  We asked him about it and he said pretty much the same thing, that he wasn't a Wallstreet shark, he was just a guy who saw computers as the future.  He told us "It was obvious to me.

I've got both as well.  I agree with your point, however, AMC is selling at like .0008 right now...
I bought 1000 at .0005 just a couple of days ago.  That's a big bump with this latest news.  Maybe they deliver, maybe they don't, but either way if I sold right now I'd have made .3 btc in 3 days.  And for those who bought 10000 shares, that's 3 btc in 3 days.  I obviously don't have to explain the rest of the degrees of 10 ha ha.

The easiest way to not deal with any of that confusion at all is to just put in your private key and import all .5.  Spend your .1 from that wallet.  Now make a new paper wallet for your .4.

I think this is awesome.  My only suggestion would be if you could make smaller denominations, like .1, .2, etc.  I think that could get more "newcomers" into it, if they could have something a) that was offline, guaranteeing nobody would be hacking into their computer, which I think is an issue for those newcomers who are interested but not computer savvy, and b) encourage the outlook that one can get BTC's without getting full BTC's.  We need more people to realize that you can get partial BTC's.  I think your bitbanknote would be able to accomplish both of these goals well and further the bitcoin cause by reaching more newcomers and making the concept a little more comfortable for them.

Easiest way, IMO to make a paper wallet is to print one at papercoin.org. This website prints paper wallets that can be folded up nicely so that the key is hidden and the address is on the outside. I printed 3 and put them in my safety deposit box. I can send BTC to them any time I want. I usually keep .5 BTC in my blockchain wallet and whenever I buy new BTC I replenish what I've spent in my blockchain wallet and put the rest on a paper wallet in my safety deposit box.

Exactly, plus in order to find out if the private key works you pretty much have to cash it in.  You could spend 10 BTC on a card, check the private key in 10 years and be completely shit out of luck and bit-card could be long gone by then. (I'm not hoping they are, just saying).

Yep, me too.  I use 2 password authentication, keep 75% of my BTC on paper in my safety deposit box, and leave 25% (which is only .5BTC) in my blockchain wallet.  I figure it's pretty safe there, and while there are numerous helpful descriptions of how to make an offline wallet, all the "download the webpage, unplug the internet, blah blah blah" is just too complicated for me to worry about when I can just make a paper wallet with papercoin.org for saving, and keep a small amount in blockchain for spending.

Agreed.  Let me tell you a story about a bridge.
Just kidding, but seriously, take my wife!
Okay, joking aside, I am 33 and was in 8th grade when the internet pretty much "started".  It still wasn't heavily adopted.  This was a couple years before Prodigy and AOL came out - before "browsers" like Netscape.  
Anyway, I was in my English class and my teacher asked my buddy and I to stay after class to check out the "world wide web".  We were like "what???"  We stayed with him after class and he had some crazy thing set up called "FTP".  This was before they had internet browsers.  I can't remember what the FTP was called, like groundhog or something.  Anyway, he said "search for something", we were like "what?"  "Anything."  So, being 8th graders, we searched "Beavis and Butthead" (popular with 8th graders at the time).  It took about a minute for the search results to load and once we chose a link, it took another 10 minutes for the picture to load (it was a dial up connection of course).  We were awestruck.  We just got a picture of WHATEVER WE WANTED on our computer.  Previous to this, computers were just typewriters that didn't need whiteout for mistakes.  
Anyway, just trying to illustrate that only 20 years ago, the internet was not used in anyone's house at all (or at least not 99% of consumers) and pictures of Beavis and Butthead took 10 minutes to load.  Now, everyone uses the internet and I can get 100 pictures of Beavis and Butthead in about 3 seconds.  
The moral is, of course, what was saying.  The people that saw the idea as revolutionary made it better and better until now, where it is easily accessible, and pretty much a general necessity for most Americans.  
The internet was brand new though, so it took some time to go mainstream.  Bitcoin is already out there, like dial up internet.  The issue IS that the layman sees no need for it and there are difficulties surrounding learning how to use it.
The internet was like this - it went from: "Oh, that's sort of cool" to "I need it every day". 
I think bitcoin will be like this one day, and I think since technology advances at an exponential rate it will take less than 20 years for it to be adopted by the mainstream.
But you know what caused the internet to REALLY finally become mainstream?  When businesses started using it for work, and when consumers started using it for entertainment.
Microsoft (and Apple, sort of) became HUGE because they made computers and the internet easy for the consumer AND business to use.
Who will be the Microsoft of bitcoin? Someone will, it is inevitable, and when this happens bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) will be huge.
TL;DR Who will be the Microsoft of bitcoin? Someone will, it is inevitable. And when this happens, bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) will be huge.

Paper wallets aren't made to be exchanged.  You make your own paper wallet and keep it safe.  If you want to transfer the BTC, you load it into a wallet online, then you can spend it.  Never buy a paper wallet off of someone for the reasons you mentioned above.  In the case of "physical bitcoins", if you ever buy one, make sure that the seller is reputable.  Or buy an empty one and load it yourself when you get it.

You can check the balance anytime you want, super easy.  Just check the public address in blockchain.info.  I can check it too! Click to view your wallet anytime --&gt; 
Also, the suggestion I would make would be to make multiple paper wallets with small amounts on them.  Use them like a savings account.  You can have 5 different .5 BTC paper wallets.  If you want to spend some, cash in a paper wallet into your blockchain.info wallet.  I say this because if you have 10 BTC on one paper wallet and something happens to it, well, fuck.  Or if you screw up where the change goes.  Shit.  BUT if you fuck up a .5 BTC paper wallet, not as big of a deal.  Need to buy something for 2 BTC?  Just cash in 4 different .5 BTC wallets.  
Last piece of advice, and another reason I'd recommend the smaller denominated wallets:  When you want to use them, put the **whole amount in your blockchain wallet**.  Just import the private key, and take the whole amount, and spend from your blockchain wallet instead of your paper wallet.  I've read about people just spending part of it and the rest going to another address and them losing it.  Just import the whole amount.  If you only spend part of it, either just keep the rest in your blockchain wallet online (doubt anyone's gonna hack your wallet for less than .5 BTC) or if you really want to just make a new paper wallet for it.  I personally don't even mess with that "change going to another wallet" bullshit.

@_date: 2013-05-16 00:30:43
...but it's way easier to just transfer ALL your BTC from that paper wallet into blockchain, then send X BTC to whoever, then make a new paper wallet with the remaining funds.  Then you don't have to worry about "change" being misplaced.
Also, I recommend splitting your BTC into many paper wallets in different denominations so that you don't have to cash in a $40,000 paper wallet to pay some guy .5 BTC.  You could have a 350 BTC paper wallet (hopefully in a safe) then like a a couple 10 BTC wallets, a few 5's, a bunch of 1's and .5's.  Just cash them in as needed.
I have nowhere near 350 BTC, so I keep my paper wallets in denominations of .5's.  And I got 4 of them! (2BTC)

So, based on these replies, it really ISN'T anonymous.  The only way to make it truly anonymous would be to buy something then have the change sent to a randomly generated address, which apparently can't be tracked back to the purchase that generated the change?

I don't understand "pass throughs".  Does the investor still get the weekly dividends?
EDIT: Nevermind, looks like the answer is yes.  Another question though, how does a pass through become your actual stock?  It says o&gt;n a blog linked earlier today that:


I guess I don't understand this.  If I own a PT share, I just ask someone if I can have a regular share instead and they give it to me or....????
EDIT 2:  I think this is the coolest part (but I don't know much, just bought 30 mini shares though...)


Once the passthrough reaches 5,000 whole ASICMINER shares (500,000 split shares) it may receive a board member seat. If board member status is confirmed, and Friedcat follows through with the plan to give each board member a trial ASICMINER mining board, any income generated will be shares as follows:

Ha.  It means "No Go" if it's No Va, but Nova means new star (in Latin).
De Wikipedia: *Feminine nominative singular of the Latin adjective novus (new). The feminine is used since the Latin word for star, stella is feminine; thus nova is a shortening of nova stella (new star).*

PT means pass through. It means you own the stock but you pay someone else 5% to hold it for you. Go to  and click on asicm and they'll give a very detailed description of pt shares. The only disadvantage is the 5% fee but that comes with a couple advantages, mostly the fact it's much easier to buy and sell pt shares. For regular shares you need to actually bid on an online forum, and you can only buy full shares, whereas on Havelock you can buy micro shares if you don't have $180 for a full share.

Some Libertarian concepts, like bitcoin of course, are valid and help the world.  On the other hand, some are completely crazy, like privatization of cops, fireman, roads, etc.  and the fact that the public has no responsibility towards anyone else in their community (cue George Costanza, "You know we're living in a SOCIETY!")  I'd have a hard time voting for a Libertarian.  
That being said, the following is interesting, and I feel the most important part of the article:

First let me say, I agree. Bitcoin may not be the final cryptocurrency.  But I don't see deflation as a reason (I DO see it as a reason for early volatility, and remember, this is still really early for BTC).  There are only two ways of doing it.  Make a currency with a limited amount  (21m) or make one with an unlimited amount (eg USD).  
I'm no expert, but what experts say is that the deflation will level out eventually (or at least slow down considerably), and certainly USD (among other currencies) isn't working at an optimal level.

Yeah, last night I read the whole AMC thread.  Looks like you have some good points, but KSlaughter seems to be doing what he said he'd do (I'm referencing the pics of the orders).
Also, I guess throwing shares back into the pool at .0005 when a bunch of people already bough at a higher price was sort of messed up, so you can either chalk that up to inexperience with KSlaughter handling the IPO, or a scam.  
I guess it's up to everyone's own discretion.
As far as the pics taken off the other website go, he says that you can't have pictures of Rigs that don't exist yet...
I'd honestly like to believe in him 100%, but you have some valid points and I'm about 50/50 right now, so I've got some shares, but not as many as I would if I was 100% on this guy/company.
@_date: 2013-05-17 23:38:12
Ahhhh...I see.  So I could be sending them to an address in Egypt, or myself.  Nobody will ever know but me!  Unless I used those coins to buy something addressed to me, right?  Then it would be pretty obvious?
So, let's say someone DID want to track me.  Let's say I sent to a public address, like I bought something from a store with a public address that anyone could see, and it came to my house.  The store's address is on their website.  Coinbase could follow that backwards right?  From my home address to the store's purchase address all the way back to the Coinbase purchase and know that I bought that thing?
Coming from the perspective of the first sentence, "Yeah, someone in Egypt could have the coins, but why are they sending something to YOUR home address?"
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:48:28
Well, the way I solve it for paper wallets:  I use papercoin.org for my paper wallets.  What I did first was printed out 2 or 3, tested them by cashing them in, and they all worked, so I now trust the next 3 that I have.  I guess you can never be 100% sure, but I think that's as close as you can get.
The thing about doing this is all my costs for testing is just a piece of paper, whereas if you wanted to test these cards it'd be like $5/test.  PLUS papercoin.org shows the source code of how the addresses are generated so you know that the person who created them doesn't have access to the private keys, whereas on these cards the maker almost certainly can just write down the private keys if he wants.
EDIT: And to be fair, everyone love Casascius coins and he could have the same info about the private keys.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:54:42

I own 2 BTC. I keep three .5 BTC paper wallets in a safety deposit box, and keep .5 in my blockchain wallet for daily use. I feel like this is the easiest way because my paper wallets are secure as possible (obviously can't be hacked as they are physical) and if my .5 gets hacked it's not the biggest deal (right now, while it's about $65 USD ). And paper wallets are super easy to make and don't require all the crazy plug in your internet/unplug your internet/etc stuff.

This is exactly what I did like an hour ago.  Bought a bitcoin via bitfloor.  I was depositing the USD at BOA and the teller asked me what it was for.  I said "bitcoin" and gave him a 2 sentence explanation of what it is.  He said "sound sketchy" and I said "You're right it does.  Go home and google it, read up on it, then make a decision."  Cool thing is, he wrote down "bitcoin" on a piece of paper, and if he's smart, we'll have a new bitcoiner!
@_date: 2013-05-21 05:20:08
Again, I'm not an expert, but it looks like right now is a good time to buy.  The price hit $3 a share about an hour ago and it looks like some big $ sold a ton of shares (probably had a sell order at $3) and it sank real quickly back down to about $2.55/share.  I'd expect it to go back up, but then again, like I said, I'm not an expert.

You also have to remember that it's not going to drop to $0 in one day, so if you see a huge crash you can always get out and only lose $25,000 or something.

I had sort of a shitty experience (probably not Gyft's fault though).  My cake day was yesterday and in honor of that, I wanted to buy some beer with btc and post it on So I went to K-mart, bought a K-mart gift card, grabbed the beer and went up to the register.  It was like 9pm, not many people in K-mart and only one register open.  I busted out the gift card on my phone and the checker had to call the manager over to override something, then the PIN didn't work.  By that time, there were like 8 people in line behind me so I said fuck it and paid with my debit card, and I'm still sitting on this K-mart gift card.  Sort of sucked, though I'm not sure if it was K-mart's fault or the gift card is messed up or what.  Maybe it takes more than 5 minutes to register as a gift card and you can't use it immediately?  I don't know...sucked though.

Yes, they are the same thing.  TAT is ThickAsTheives which is his username on bitcointalk.org.  He runs the TAT.ASICMINER Pass Through.  Havelock runs their own ASICMINER Pass Through, but the shares are all the same ASICMINER shares issued by FriedCat (ASICMINER CEO).  It really comes down to which website you like better, and if you trust TAT or Havelock more.  I personally have 100 micro shares each in both TAT and Havelock.
Basically, TAT and Havelock have a bunch of direct shares, and they sell you fractions of those on BTCT and Havelock.  Their direct shares get split up into your Pass Through shares.  They sell you parts of their shares and they make money from the 5% fee on dividends they get for administering the Pass Through.  So FriedCat issues them dividends for their direct shares, then they split up those dividends to the PT owners, less 5%.
However, like I said, they are all the same shares of ASICMINER, so remember that when reading this (and now that I've read through the Havelock details, TAT may very well run that PT as well).  Also, notice the part I bolded:






1. To provide an additional venue for investors to buy or sell ASICMINER shares more easily by splitting the shares.
2. To provide an easy way for ASICMINER shareholders to reinvest their dividends to maximize compounded interest opportunities.
3. To consolidate enough ASICMINER shares so as to reach 5,000 whole shares, thus increasing their inherent value with potential access to ASICMINER’s established and future board member benefits, namely any hardware opportunities ASICMINER provides exclusively to board members.
Each 1 share of ASICM represents 1/100th of a share of ASICMINER maintained and verified by either Friedcat or any officially designated exchange, and has rights to 1/100th of the dividends of a whole ASICMINER share.
Each ASICM share has the right to 95% of its respective dividends. 5% will be retained for asset management fees. The amount of the dividend is defined as the same amount distributed by ASICMINER to the shares held by the issuer for this asset. Dividends will be paid within 48 hours or less of confirmed payments from ASICMINER.


Any public votes presented by ASICMINER will be decided by the issuer for all asset shares at his own discretion.


Shares cannot be imported or exported by shareholders at this time, but shares can be freely bought and sold. Shares may be imported at will by the issuer alone.


Once the passthrough reaches 5,000 whole ASICMINER shares (500,000 split shares) it may receive a board member seat. If board member status is confirmed, and Friedcat follows through with the plan to give each board member a trial ASICMINER mining board, any income generated will be shares as follows:






Issuer reserves the following rights:
1. To change schedule of dividends to be in line with any changes in schedule the underlying asset may enact.
2. To change the % of board mining profits withheld if expenses, like electricity, are not covered by the 15% portion being withheld.
3. To make changes to this contract that represent the best interests of its shareholders
4. To correct and clarify any gross errors or details herein that may prove to be open to misinterpretation.
5. To limit the total amount of shares allowed within the asset once it has reached 5000 whole shares (500,000 split shares).
In the event that the issuer chooses to, or is forced to, close this asset for any reason, the following methods may be used for dissolution in any combination:
1. A new operator may be vetted and chosen by ThickAsThieves to take over control of the asset.
2. Shares may be bought back from shareholders at a reasonable market value.
3. Shares may be converted to direct whole shares and redistributed to shareholder e-mail accounts with Friedcat.
4. Shares may be converted into equivalent whole shares on any other existing ASICMINER passthrough or exchange and redistributed to shareholders.

Did you enable 2 passwords AND another type of authentication?  I have two passwords enabled, PLUS email password.  This means that when I get the the blockchain.info wallet login screen that blockchain.info automatically sends me an email, and I have to enter my password PLUS the password they sent in the email.  I don't even have to use MY second password UNTIL I try to send BTC or make other transactions.  
Did you enable anything like that?  I know there is email authentication but there are a few other ways they do it too (they are escaping me right now).  But if you did that without knowing it then that may be why you can't get in.

I have no business model, nor any techincal or mechanical engineering experience.  I do have an idea though.  
You know when you go to a 7-11 or a grocery store and you get rung up?  In order to pay you either a) give cash or b) use a card.  You run your card through the swipe thing, type in your pin, press enter and you're done.  
What we need to get BTC going is one of those touch screen card swipers where you can use BTC so when the choices come up it says "credit/debit/ebt/BTC".  If you choose "BTC", a QR code pops up for the 7-11 that includes the price of what you bought.  Take your phone, QR scan that shit, press "confirm $12.89 --&gt; 7-11" and bounce.
For one, it would be just as quick as a credit card.  Secondly, people would see "BTC" and wonder what it was if they didn't know. They'd also see other people using BTC and ask them about it.  That person would be all "yeah it's a cool new thing and it saved me $4.21 because there are no transaction fees."  Third, people could see how much they saved on screen, something like "you saved $1.48 by using BTC instead of a credit/debit card today" (and nobody has your personal information!)
I think something like that could blow the fuck up. If you develop that shit, just give me like 15% of your profits for the idea and we cool.
EDIT: I mean you could even charge a super small BTC transaction fee.  Like .00001 BTC per transaction, which is miniscule right now but could be worth a bunch in the future if you gather up enough transactions AND BTC continues to rise.
@_date: 2013-06-08 20:21:49
Depends. 
As said, there is a 5% fee with TAT who sells the micro shares.  With that though, comes the convenience of selling micro shares instead of full shares.  You can't sell a half or quarter of a full share if you want to, but you can sell 50 or 25 micro shares if you want (for example, all your BTC is in ASICM and you want an external hard drive you just saw on sale for BTC.  You can just sell 50 micro shares, keep 50 in the exchange, and go buy your hard drive without having to sell the full 2.5 BTC share).
Or vice versa, if you don't have 2.5 BTC to buy a full share, you can buy 25 shares 4 times, maybe each paycheck or whatever.  The 5% fee is negligible, and if you have 100 shares you can always sell them and buy a full share or even email TAT directly and he can give you a direct share.
Edit: BTW, TAT = ThickAsThieves who is the person selling the ASICM micro shares.  Even on Havelock, where it doesn't say "TAT" in the name of the shares, he is the one running it.

This is a good point. If bitcoin does eventually gain more recognition as an accepted currency, then there will be no need to cash out into a fiat of any kind. Just use bitcoin to make all of your purchases. Shit, I bet if one tried hard enough, he could find a way to use only bitcoins for all his purchases that he makes right now!  If one was ultimately confident in bitcoin, one would immediately convert his paychecks into bitcoin and hold no USD at all (except for perhaps utilities and rent payments, though I'm sure we've all seen recent posts showing that soon we may he able to pay our utilities in BTC...and a man in Canada is selling his house in BTC...)

I've asked this same question, and apparently there are so many trillions of address combinations that if you are off by just a little, like a capital J instead of a small j, the chance that that address actually exists is minuscule, like so small it would never happen.  Like you'd win the lottery before you could accidentally send to an address that existed.  
So if you do indeed send to a wrong address, the transaction will not be confirmed and you'll get the btc deposited back into the account from which it was sent.

The same way USD is not volatile.  It's accepted everywhere, society has put a "value" on each dollar and it stays relatively stable.
Of course this is within the USA.  Against the world, the USD is going down in value due to inflation/printing more and more USD.  This won't happen with BTC.  There is a finite amount.  Once society decides what it's worth, it will stabilize.  But most of society doesn't even know what it is, so it will be volatile for a long time.  
just trying to spread the word because most of us believe in its fundamentals, and hopefully someday we'll achieve a level of acceptance, use, and stability.  
Either that will happen or it will drop to $0 aka worthless...which is also "stable".

I am not an expert in taxes, but I've read on this sub that the USA taxes BTC if you cash out in USD, and if it does become more widely accepted it will be taxed as an investment or income or something.  I guess that will depend on how it is perceived by the US government when that happens. 
But true, it will never be backed OR controlled by a central bank/government, and that's part of it's allure.

I'm no economist, but this mining company seems a lot different than Asicm.  First and foremost, Asicm builds their own shit AND mines.  This place looks like they just mine, if I'm reading correctly.  I mean, Asicm just sold $1 mil worth of hardware last week.  That's in addition to solo mining that just started, so although this may be a good investment (or may not), I wouldn't compare it to ASICM.

First step: Get more than $250,000.  Second step: Make sure it is in two different bank policies. 
...still working on that first step...

Yep, so buy 100 :-)
Edit: Also, they are PT shares. To buy shares where you have complete ownership I believe you need to go to the asic miner forum on bitcointalk.org.

Thank you for writing that, I couldn't understand them.

I bought at $87 yesterday and I'm actually glad it's falling because I want more...for cheaper!

Yep, that's how it works. Obviously the closer you price your BTC to the market value the quicker they sell.

Also, personally I like the analogy, but I'm not as educated about BTC as some of the other people here, so I'll leave it to them.

Sorry I have no experience with bitinstant but I've heard good things.

I want to try!  Australia. Australia.  Australia.

Not sure if you got the memo, but we're putting cover pages on our TPS reports now.

I don't think he'll treat it as a joke.  I don't think he'll do a story on it, I think the best bet is to get a bitcoin advocate on as a guest.  He'll make fun of it, satirically of course, which always relays the opposite viewpoint,(as is the point of his satire/character) and then the advocate will get a chance to answer questions about it and inform his audience.

Love and agree with the logic, and appreciate the tip :-)

I'm going to make a $200 post right now because I'll be asleep when it hits $200 in about 6 hours.

Tell me if it works! Or, I guess I'll find out. I wonder if anyone would be dumb enough to accept a negative tip...

Alright.  I just want to know if I'm doing this right:
1. Buy BTC (I use bitfloor/BoA)
2. Transfer from bitfloor to blockchain.info wallet
3. Transfer whatever I want to save from blockchain wallet to paper wallet.  I use papercoin.org. Put those in safety deposit box.
4. Keep small amount in blockchain wallet for easy spending.
5. Make sure I have double authentication in blockchain wallet.
Additional question:  Can a paper wallet key be used numerous times?  For example, I'm always worried when loading, so I'll load .001 BTC to test it out.  Then I'll put the paper wallet private key into blockchain, and transfer the .001 back into blockchain.  Can I then load more onto that same paper wallet and use that same private key in the future, or are private keys one-time use?  Also, can I check the balance of a paper wallet by the address?  If so, how?
Basically, what worries me is that I'm going to load a wallet with 2 BTC, but mistype the address.  Then I'll let this paper wallet sit in my safety deposit box for 10 years.  If BTC is worth thousands, I'm worried I will pull it out and find that nothing is loaded on it.  
And lastly, how easy is it for someone to hack my printer and find my private keys I printed out, and what should I do to avoid this happening?

Hey, so I just bought my first bitcoins and have them in my blockchain wallet.  What are these chrome/firefox extensions to which you are referring?

I agree with most of your points, but if you could link me to proof he isn't fictional, that would be super.  Only thing I saw on the thread was his nephew Gerald with a 2 week old account vouching for him.
@_date: 2013-06-09 19:52:20
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Whoever can make it easy to use will make a ton of money /prediction.

Or if you had that $1000 in bitcoin in 2009 you'd have many nice houses today (only 4 years).
