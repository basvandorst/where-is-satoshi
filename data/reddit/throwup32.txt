Here are charities that are legitimate that help Ukranian orphans.  Please donate to real charities instead of some anonymous person who just signed up 3 days ago and is asking for $65,000. Legitimate charities are set up so your donation is tax deductible and registered through the government.  Do your research before donating, they have not provided sufficient proof and those saying they have are being misled.  There's a reason many people are saying this is not right.  Please don't waste your money on some random guy on the internet who claims he works with a russian orphanage.

Well let's see

Can you ask staff and tell us why this school called "Harmony" shows up when you insert the certificate details that you have provided in screenshot form into the search for the government business register? The other number in the detail section also matches on your certificate.   This is the search -

Ukraine_Orphans, one questions: according to this article: 
Most of the kids from Orphanage Topolek are in Svyatohirska, not in Kharkiv! Svyatohirska is NOT a major city but a small town few kilometer north of Slavyansk. Are Radio Svoboda wrong?

    Родинам, чиє житло зруйноване, влада пропонує тимчасово виїхати в Святогірськ, Ізюм або інші міста, де з житлом можуть допомогти волонтери.
They are offered to by authority, but most children are here...

Again. The director of Topolek says, that most of the orphans are in Svyatohirska. That's not Kharkiv! So are Radio Svoboda wrong?
and here

Few questions from the Donetsk, my friend.
    Are you sure children on the photos in the gallery are not from Kharkiv Harmony?
    Are you sure those children agreed to be photographed for your IndieGoGo campaign?
    Why isn't your name mentioned anywhere?
    Why are you obscuring your face?
    Why did you initially used fake press release with the stamp of AIESEC Kharkiv without any rights on it and not having their permission?

I'm interested in knowing more about the Kharkiv Harmony you mentioned, since searching the certificate provided by the OP turns up exactly that school.  [RES ignored duplicate image] 
This answer doesn't even make sense

Did you ever give an explanation for the document with the seal and addendum that said Help Us that everyone was saying was fake?
I believe if you can sort that out for people, they will be much less skeptical and willing to donate.

OK so just so you know, I am communicating and translating for people from the orphanage.
When I found this comment by the people, I couldn't understand much myself and met some other staff managers yesterday who told me they basically needed somebody in journalistic style to press release about the incident - and I am pretty sure they got some young person who probably was kind enough to volunteer but not very good with journalism or language per se.
That seal and other things are from Kharkiv region, naturally, since they tried contacting any organization when they arrived here - youth, voluntary - etc, and spread word about themselves.
Using that as a proof here... well, lead to a great skepticism. They probably gathered everything or anything they could find to show they exist - except that this is Reddit, and of course if somebody is contributing, they want to be sure.
Several people asked about more photos etc, but it was already midnight then.
Yesterday I went myself to the children and printed this paper and clicked photos, and so on - gathered everything and that's it...

Sorry, but my fine-tuned post-Soviet bullshit detector is going off. OP admitted to have made up a non-existent legal entity as the official beneficiary of this fundraising campaign. Why would you do that if you collect money for a state institution (with a verifiable, auditable bank account) in Ukraine?
    BetterUkraine Foundation is unknown. There is no home page, email contacts and even names.
        I chose the name Better Ukraine Foundation since Indiegogo asked for name of parent organization or something - please, there is absolutely no discrepancy about this.
Another thing that's also a huge red flag, is that you can't point to a single person who's in charge here, who could be criminally liable; even though orphanages in post-Soviet countries like Ukraine are strictly regulated state institutions employing educated, salaried professionals. Their story about deputies that refused to help orphans from Slaviansk, of all places , is also highly suspect.
If you are legitimate charity provide a phone number for someone to call to verify who you are instead of hiding your face.
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:43:50
And you seem like you're in on it.  Go help your own people instead of trying to steal it from others.  Keep discounting everyone who questions them as silly American teenagers.  Does that make sense to you?  Get a job and make your own money instead of relying on others to give it to you. Scammers are all over your country and they are con artist.  I'm sorry if people want to make sure this charity is real before handing 65,000 over.  I hope indigogo shuts it down soon and gives people their money back.
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:33:19
Yes I remember you,  why don't you go and verify then since you're in Ukraine.  Provide a video of you going to the orphanage and verifying who is in charge and who they are please.  I can't just quit my job and travel half way across the world, most people can't.  The only people who are defending them end up being foreigners with shoddy english skills.  Doesn't that sound a little suspicious to everyone?
If you are Ukranian, why don't you help this 'orphanage' instead of requesting money from the people of the United States.  We have our own orphans and disasters to fix. Help your own people instead of scamming it from us.  
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:14:57
More 'proof' in another language.   What is that suppose to prove. You know fully well only you and your buddies understand your language.  It could say We love Nazis for all we know.  Hope your ad gets pulled for being fraudulent soon.  Go back into that hole you crawled out of.
@_date: 2014-08-01 21:22:55
Andreiukr, you have checked and verified everything correctly, so you will be backing this charity since you have made 100% that this is a real orphanage and all the funds will be going to these kids.  You haven't even been to the orphanage so how would you know this is legitimate.  I hope you are ready to pay back the $65,000 to everyone.  You say you are not affiliated with them but your actions prove otherwise.  Tell Archiduke he's doing a great job scamming everyone.
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:53:51
*******Yes everyone who patiently waited for answers is a troll. Anyone who wants to make sure the charity is real before giving them $65,000 is a troll. I donate to several charities, but I verify who I am giving it to before I hand over a large sum of money.  I'm sorry if I don't blindly give my money away and call me a troll.  Ukraine_orphans has only been on for 3 days and are requesting $65,000 without verifiable proof.  When there have been doubts about the proof they have provided thus  far, they call people trolls.  
Why can't your people help them? Why do you need to scam us?
You don't even know if this charity is real, yet you are so persistent on people donating, it makes no sense except that you are in on it.  What a coincidence you are from the same area and have the same broken english patterns.*******  
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:03:02
At least I'm honest.  You on the other hand, claim to be this charity but when people start asking questions, you ignore them or pretend you don't know English.   All of a sudden your English is perfect when you're requesting money or finding ways to pass of your artwork as an orphan.  The levels you stoop to are amazing.  What next, you're going to be asking for computers for each child and ipods?   Is that really your priority when they don't have a place to live.  Ridiculous!
At least you found one community to take advantage. I can't wait to see the new car you buy with the bitcoin you take from these gullible people.
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:32:27
Yes, Spam every forum and subreddit around to donate to
 your scam.
