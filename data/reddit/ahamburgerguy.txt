No salt, just a keen sense of direction. Thanks for the cheap coins bud
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:34:13
Nah, sorry for you I was right
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:56:55
Your post did not age well AT ALL in about a month just like I said

Sell, wait for the crash, buy back in

Are you new to crypto? It goes up a couple double digits one day and you think that means anything in the long run? Didn’t I say a month? So much confirmation bias, it’s pretty amusing. Again, see you at the bottom in about a month.

Ah yeah, I remember these “BTC to 50K” posts back in 2017. It seemed a lot more plausible then. I’ll see you at the actual bottom in a month or so.

Don’t fees just offset these gains?

Not really, you should be honest and tell him to expect to lose 30-60% of his money in the short term but if he keeps an eye out for bubbles he can have a 3-5 day window of selling it for massive gains before it crashes again.

Sounds like taxis in the US, too, before Uber put them in their place. I think the taxi industry as a whole is sketchy in every country.

You mean loss?
@_date: 2019-10-23 01:07:42
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:57:55
No, I’m looking forward to the crash so I can buy more.

I think a state relinquishing their authority over their national money supply is really sketchy when you have an economic system that can’t exist without interactions with the state, like capitalism.
It’s pretty much impossible to eliminate all forms of inflation - prices, regardless of the unit of account used to measure them, will always fluctuate due to firm/consumer decisions and broader economic patterns. 
The issue is that Bitcoin has a fixed supply while the potential supply of USD is, theoretically, infinite. If our economy keeps growing, it would have to deflate. The issue people here don’t recognize is that cost of living adjustments are a thing and firms would just begin paying workers less as BTC deflates, just as they would if the USD were to deflate. Labor has real value, and that wouldn’t change. They wouldn’t be any better off than before unless they’re big time savers - most Americans aren’t. Some could argue that this tendency to spend now is due to the inflationary pressures of the USD but I don’t believe that because the average American doesn’t even know what inflation is.
Another issue is credit. The American economy runs on debt. People, companies, governments all depend on debt and the broader finance industry. How would lending work? Why would I want to lend out money for a modest return + risk when I can just hold onto it and be better off without the risk? 
Governments wouldn’t be able to stimulate or reign in the economy during times of boom/bust. Governments would also be increasing the risk of defaulting on their debt since they can’t capitalize on seigniorage. 
I don’t really believe in Bitcoin as a viable national or international currency, I’m just a speculator who wants to sell my share of it to someone in the future for more than I paid for it. I feel like that’s what most people here are but they are too stubborn to admit it.

I described monetary inflation, which is what the meme is referencing.
Read an economy book, a uni textbook, and read up about the variable types of inflation before you speak out of your ass. You can start with the Quantity Theory of Money.
I’m an Econ major - what did you go to school for?

Simplified: don’t look at money as green pieces of paper that’s gets you stuff but instead look at it as a “voucher” that you can use to access resources like food, water, shelter, consumer goods, transportation, etc. Fiat paper money is a way of making a worker’s ability to access the work of others (by buying things) easier. If we didn’t have paper money to represent access to resources, you’d have to exchange items/resources with every store or restaurant that has something like in order to get their goods or service. Like your PlayStation or computer. Sounds troublesome, right? Well, paper money makes that a simpler process. Instead of bringing your PlayStation to the store to get other things, you just give the store the paper money and they can get a PlayStation themselves. Easy!
However, there’s a limited amount of paper money out there. AND the economy is always growing, so we always need to supply new “vouchers” (paper money) to account for the new amount of resources being produced. In a world without inflation, the government would print just enough”vouchers” out to match the new output. That would mean the value of each voucher remains the same. If they don’t print enough “vouchers” out to account for the new output, then the existing vouchers will have to take on additional resources to represent. All output is defined in terms of these vouchers (dollars) so they will always be represented by the amount of fiat money out there. Always. So now that voucher you gave the store can buy 2 playstations - there wasn’t enough vouchers for that new PlayStation to be represented by, so the old vouchers do it themselves. That’s called deflation.
Inflation is when the government prints out TOO MANY vouchers to account for the new output. The issue is that, with fiat money (the “vouchers”) the amount of output will always need to be represented by the existing money supply, no matter what. That’s how it works. So if the government prints out too many vouchers, then the existing and new resources will need to be spread out across all of them. Let’s say the government prints out nearly double the existing amount of the money supply. Now, your voucher can only buy .5 of a PlayStation since there are more vouchers out there than new resources they can represent - that is inflation.

He’s right on the ball. The top image is comparing monetary inflation to the value of a Bitcoin when valued in dollars. It’s an idiotic comparison.
The USD, unlike BTC, is accepted as a unit of account. Our entire output is defined in terms of the USD. The inflation that occurs with the USD is directly related to broader economic patterns that deal with tangible aspects of life.
BTC’s “ability” to deflate has nothing to do with a purchaser’s ability to access more resources if they held some in 2011 and then converted it to USD at a higher real value than before in 2014. It is not used a medium of exchange nor a unit of account so its ability to “deflate” has nothing to do with output - rendering this comparison moot. You’d only be able to buy more groceries because a bunch of speculators are willing to give you more USD than you paid for it - in hopes that they do the same in the future.
