Erowid.org is so great. Thank you!

You ain't poor no more

What's going to happen to all the USB ports? What do you know? Should we short USB port futures?

Why not go ask a real qualified accountant in the real world instead of looking up on Reddit?
@_date: 2018-09-12 09:35:08
It's should have, not should of. You can have things but you can't of things.

No, because governments aren't allowed to print it like it's going out of style. It's controlled. The reason the paper money isn't worth shit is because the people who print it are crooked fuckers that print more than they should even though they know it will devalue everyone's money.

Holding them for so long seems to have worked in your favor, even if there was a colossal price drop right now it's bound to go back up. I would say relax.

Fifth language? God damn! That's impressive. What are the other four?

Can I buy other, more valuable fruit with my half an apple?
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:38:54
Oh yeah. I think I can see a few Bitcoins in the background. That must be the relevance of this post...
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:33:26
Like all things

It's one of the most easily grown plants on Earth, so I think it would be very difficult for any 1 company to gain a market share.

So, are Venezuelans mostly using Bitcoin now? I would imagine that the average person would rapidly find a solution to their money being worthless, so I'm wondering what the common man's solution is currently.
@_date: 2018-10-21 18:55:56
Wow that was fucking annoying
@_date: 2019-08-29 06:02:24
Oops. I thought that meant "burn the fucking daycare". Be right back...
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:24:50
Pfft. Shows what you know! I got two kids and I don't see any bitches around here... ;n;
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:18:11
Weird. I wonder how it materializes a digital currency.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:07:21
Erections are going up. That is a bullish Market, though.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:09:28
What is it?
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:47:40
Kind of defeats the purpose of the Bitcoin, then.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:11:55
Reddit demands real money for their imaginary gold.

Also Google Wallet is free
And I think PayPal is just $0.25 to transfer
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:53:03
Fair enough
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:37:53
And where will this house be?
@_date: 2019-04-10 08:40:27
Bad investment...
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:41:48
Holy shit what a nightmare
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:07:14
Most important, and I think obvious point right here. Price manipulation of currency and commodities has been well-documented for hundreds of years. So fucking obvious that that's what's going on.

Idea for a new crypto-currency name: "Chicoin"

Scenario E: they release the documents further proving that 911 was nothing like the official report, and the world doesn't bat an eye and just keeps right on going exactly as it is.

That only looks like vacancy to you. It's actually her femputer calculating the best time to cash out. Facial features and other higher functions shut down to conserve processing power.
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:35:05
Well, that Astro cat definitely helps.
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:22:57
That's kind of a Grizzly pun.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:30:41
I fully agree. It's such an unintuitive rule.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:47:20
Well... Being a billionaire is pretty uncommon. So I'm going to have to say no they are not normal people. Normal meaning common, which carries with it no negative or positive connotations whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:55:25
You're closest without going over.
@_date: 2019-09-08 12:32:39
I don't know anything about what it is or isn't going to do, however I know when I keep inflating a balloon, eventually it pops. I don't actually think that's what's Happening Here, but you can't really fault people for seeing it that way at first glance.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:23:23
So you're saying there's no bulshit involved?
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:52:29
I mean, rich people do exist, and they're not smarter or any different than poor people. They just have more money. Ever see that documentary made by the Johnson &amp; Johnson kid? Pretty down-to-earth dude. Normal teenager problems. Except for, you know, being a billionaire.
That having been said... this post is still stupid.

So I made an inference. Judging from his vocabulary, and his moronic devotion to 17 year old girl, I'm guessing he hasn't been alive on this Earth very long...
Edit: context clues, man
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:54:00
He's 17 and has 26k to just play with, I'd say he already has his pick of the ladies.
