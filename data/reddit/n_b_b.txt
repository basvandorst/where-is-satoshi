I think what they're getting at is that you'll soon need a time machine to be able to afford bitcoin.

Trust me, there are plenty of wealthy Hungarians and foreigners living in Budapest.

It reads something along the lines of:
*You don't need a time machine yet to not miss out.
Bitcoin is the money of the future.
Your future's money.*

So let's hear your forecast

So these are like Hashnest's pacmic contracts?
(Basically a bond with a 12 month maturity)

If the Chinese not being able to withdraw their bitcoin from the exchanges doesn't qualify as bad news, then I don't know what does.
If the Chinese held less than 1% of bitcoins then this wouldn't be news and the price today would not have dropped as significantly.
@_date: 2017-02-08 11:06:19
Or at least that's what they want you to think
@_date: 2017-02-27 15:23:13
Whatever you do, don't flood the market.
Sell it in smaller batches if you choose to sell.
You'll be doing yourself and everyone else a favor.
@_date: 2017-02-24 09:47:52
I don't understand why any sane person would want to dump all their bitcoin like that unless they're panicking.
He/she could have made a lot more by selling in smaller batches.
(on second thought, it could have been a margin call that triggered a liquidation)

I hope those Chinese hackers have the latest scoop on the ETF and the PBoC is acting on that information with the aim of making a hefty profit.
@_date: 2017-02-24 11:52:34
Dream on dreamer
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:06:33
There appears to be a lot of support around $950-$960.
Let's hope it holds.
@_date: 2017-02-08 09:59:34
Aren't the official numbers always a tad rosier than reality?
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:21:09
also a possibility
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:35:39
Bhoy, I am sick and tired of the fact that every time "PBoC" and "bitcoin" are mentioned in an article there's a run on bitcoin.
We (the non-chinese) need to stock up and weaken their influence if we want bitcoin to succeed as a store of value.

You may want to consider changing the offer deadline given the ETF anticipation. Ppl are more likely to show interest after the dust has settled.
@_date: 2017-02-24 09:39:34
You're looking at the wrong Y axis
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:31:40
Good idea!
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:04:58
No-one's dumping anything before the SEC decision
@_date: 2017-01-14 17:29:59
Same thing happened to me yesterday.
Any updates on this? (I was installing the 64bit version)
@_date: 2017-01-16 11:46:37
Yep, thanks.
Went ahead and contacted them.
Manfred appears to think it's a false positive.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:28:19
Doesn't this mean Chinese exchanges are screwed?
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:48:21
Thanks Stevaavo!
