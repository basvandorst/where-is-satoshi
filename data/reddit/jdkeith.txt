Theft has a certain definition and certain patterns it matches. It's possible for theft to be a good thing, but people are arguing against the definition by *how they feel about the action*, which is not valid.

Property or, more specifically, land / natural resource taxes. Most school, fire, police, and roads are paid for out of local property and gas taxes. Only a few percent of the federal budget goes to infrastructure. Most goes to the military, transfer payments, and interest on debt.

Your local property taxes (which you also pay even if you're just renting) fund the majority of the costs of local schools, roads, police and fire. Excise taxes on gasoline and vehicle registration taxes also pay for roads. State income and sales taxes pay for a small amount of school, and bigger infrastructure projects.
At the federal level (as of 2018), these are the broad categories of expenditures
* "Defense"
* Interest on debt
* Social security
* Medicare
* Medicaid
* "Other mandatory"
* "Other discretionary (which includes transportation)
Other discretionary is 16.8% of the total federal expenditures, but includes vetrans benefits, health, housing assistance, etc.
[As of 2017]( transportation and water spending at the federal level was 98 billion, from revenues+debt of about 3800 billion = 2.6% = "jack shit."
FBI and DOJ which are the equivalent of (a more authoritarian) police, consumed $9 billion and $29.2 billion (projected 2020) respectively, totaling 38 billion = 1%.
Military is 623 billion or 16.4%. It's hard to say how much a purely defensive military would cost (defense not including propping up the petrodollar), but it's safe to say less than half.
So 2.6+1+8.2 = 11.8% in absolute worst case, probably less. So I may have been talking out of my hat, but 7% isn't that far from ~12%, it's a lot closer to ~12% than 100% is.

* No laws against privacy coins or secondary layers - I have no intention of obeying any government ruling outlawing or requiring registration cryptography and the like anyways, but let's put that in there.
* Laws against anything which could hurt the lightning network, coin join, etc. (treating them as money transmitters, conspiracy, etc.)
* Non-custodial wallets don't require KYC/AML. This protects Bisq. Again, I'll still use it regardless, but let's get it out of the way.

You keep ignoring my point which can be taken completely dispassionately. Whether something is a requirement of living in a society has no effect on whether something is involuntary or matches the pattern of theft or not. That's a philosophical position, not a libertarian position.
It's like saying that MLK Jr was not a criminal because he the laws he broke were bullshit. Sure, I agree that they were, but that's irrelevant to the definition of criminal.

Some taxes are really bad compared to others by certain metrics.
Taxes on wages are horrible because, c'mon, it's partial slavery and it discourages production.
Taxes on sales are bad because they're regressive.
Poll/head taxes are regressive.
Taxes on capital gains aren't AS bad in the short term, but they discourage investment and, ultimately, production.
Taxes on inheritance can be justified as much as any other income tax, but they won't raise much and are also hated.
Property taxes are hated, and also hurt the construction market.
Taxes on the rental value of economic land are acceptable because it's closer to a use fee than the other taxes, rent gets paid regardless of the tax or not, they're economically efficient, and they internalize the market, though there are open questions about how much they could raise.
Pigouvian taxes are acceptable because they internalize the market.

"Pay for your own roads/schools" is just as cringey as "taxation is theft." Most infrastructure is paid from local and excise taxes, and most people are bitching about the federal government and, specifically, wage taxes when saying "taxation is theft." At the federal level, not more than 7% of "income" taxes pay for infrastructure.
It's more accurate to say "okay, bomb all your own foreigners and spy on the other people in this country yourself if you don't like it."

Something being useful doesn't mean it's not also something else.

There may be some transfers back to schools (not colleges), but they are small and probably not across the board. I should've phrased my assertion differently. The point is, the services people think of when they think of government are what most of your FEDERAL taxes are paying for.
When confronted with "taxation is theft" almost no one says "enjoy your grandma eating catfood" which would at least be an argument about social security or some other transfer program (and SS should be a lockbox anyways... but I digress). Instead they say "better stop using the roadz LOL BTFO!" which is fucking dumb because, like I said, roads pretty much aren't paid for at the FEDERAL level excepting a federal gas tax which isn't usually what the anarchist is talking about and certainly has nothing to do with the Bitcoin AML/KYC bullshit.

Proof of work systems validate by being statistically connected to the consumption of energy in the level of reality which contains the program. An external system validates the simulation.
Various proof of work systems could be broken, but the ones in use appear to map to energy consumption. If that connection holds, then the operation of Bitcoin in a simulator is using something external to the simulation to validate messages. If that connection is broken, then that's no longer the case.
Proof of stake doesn't reference anything external to the simulation except human decrees (e.g. NXT saying "this is the NXT private key which shall sign checkpoints"). In that sense, something external is validating it, but it's humans so I'm not interested.

Under governor Benson, New Hampshire had a fund people could donate as much extra tax as they wanted. IIRC it didn't get much if any donations.
If most people want to fund a state, then why does tax evasion have to be punished. A rough metric is the cost of tax law enforcement presuming that the taxing agency wouldn't try to collect taxes if they failed to bring in more than the cost of enforcement.

I agree that taxation, inasmuch as it's involuntary, is immoral (*). The method of taxation is not irrelevant when looking at efficiency. Taxing immovable non-produced goods is a lot more efficient and hurts production a lot less than taxing income generally or sales.


True, but property taxes are more visible and almost always more local. Visible taxes cause people to bitch more than taxes which get taken out of the paycheck in small amounts every week.

The more I think of it the more I believe that bitcoin should just go over to using addresses as discussed [here]( There's almost no downside.
1. With a finite minichain, the block sizes could be much larger, outputs should be smaller (everything should be either P2SH or a regular address - no output conditions).
2. That allows people to run full nodes ... on their phones
3. People don't lose funds for stupid reasons such as change addresses - it's far more intuitive
4. Dust is not (as much of) a problem
The only immediate downside I see is that there is less anonymity, but people can always make payments to themselves plus change addresses if they want. That should be handled at the program layer, not the protocol.
Add in sidechains with two-way pegging and things look even better.

Being against the state doesn't mean having solutions, just like being atheist doesn't necessarily mean you have solutions on how to be good and just. The abuses of those acting in the name of the state are very real, and it's nice to have a subreddit to let off steam - just like those in etc. also do.
My complaint isn't so much against public goods and collective action in the form of a state *until* other solutions are found, it's in the, for lack of a better term, *worship* of the state and double-standards. E.G. voting makes almost any abuse okay, police carrying long guns into a Chipotle is okay where it wouldn't be for a regular non-violent citizen, dilution of responsibility while "we are the government" mantra continues, etc. That, to me, is delusional thinking.

My counterproposal:
1. It is up to the government of NY to identify and block NY residents from accessing crypto exchanges or hot wallet services. It is not the responsibility of any service not located in NY or with an owner who is a current resident of NY to police on NY's behalf.
2. It is up to the government of NY to identify the parties in a transaction and they may only claim jurisdiction on NY residents and businesses.
3. Innovations in all areas of cryptocurrency shall not be prohibited. Mixers, alt coins, software wallets, and the like may continue to be developed by current NY residents or businesses even if they cannot use them per  and  It shall be legal for NY residents and businesses to sell or give away such software or sell or give away consulting services to such projects regardless of jurisdiction or whether or not such services, if used by New Yorkers would violate other provisions of this proposal.
The above, being more likely to be supported by the people using Bitcoin and residents of NY who have a stake in same instead of a very-indirectly-elected bureaucracy shall be considered more in line with "the will of the people" and thus shall override the current NYDFS proposal.

I don't know I exist. Based on the definition of terms, I know *something* exists because verbs can't operate on null references. But that's presupposing those relationships axiomatically.

Almost every government benefit I get, I get by paying my local property taxes, tolls, and gas taxes and, while I wish the property taxes fell only on the land portion of my holdings (even if the total due was the same), I pay these gladly because it's a good value proposition and I can actually talk to and meet local and state politicians.
It could be argued that the DEFENSIVE military protects me (this pretty much means solely the navy and missile tracking / nukes as everything else can be used offensively). Fine. That's a small percentage of the federal budget if ONLY DEFENSIVE USES are factored in. It could be further argued that things like NOAA help me (though the military would need to have those anyways and those DIRECTLY benefit everyone so a case can be made for general welfare). Fine. Those things costs less than one tenth of one percent of the budget.
I'll write the fedgov a few thousand dollar check right now to clear that up. What I *won't* do is:
1. Play the sour grapes, marginal utility game of "he has more so he must pay more!" How about people who get money from doing bad pay more?

POW is problematic due to centralization. I can think of a few potential solutions to that, but am not convinced. Proof of Stake is a lot better in many ways, but it relies on checkpointing which is, to me, a problem.
Deflation isn't the end of the world, but it is making Bitcoin more of a store of value than a currency. It might end up being more of a settlement method than a currency. I'd probably have made BTC continuously issue 100BTC every block forever which would cause inflation to asymptotically approach zero - but then it might not have gotten the early adopters on board.
Blockchain bloat is one of the largest issues to me, and there are viable solutions but they'd almost certainly be breaking changes.

True, but bitcoins are property. Let's use motorcycles as an example and pretend that motorcycles are a capital-gains-worthy good.
If I buy a motorcycle with cash at FMV, I don't owe any taxes to the IRS. If I sell a purchased motorcycle later, then I owe capital gains on the increase in FMV from when I bought it.
If I build (mine) my own motorcycle, I don't owe the IRS anything (unless they have some section about imputed income I'm not aware of). But the FMV for capital gains calculations occurs at the point I mined it. Still, no taxes unless I sell it.
Applied to bitcoin world, the only *reward for service* in mining comes from transaction fees. The block reward is as built as that motorcycle and shouldn't be taxed unless sold.
Note that I'm not saying this is the way the IRS sees it, but I am saying it appears to be consistent to my mind. They can't use money / monetary instrument semantics on it since they declared it property.

I'm assuming you're referring to federal income/capgains taxes. Here's what your ($80,000) paid for (2010 figures, but the ballpark is right)
What I consider B.S.
1. War overseas (not defense) ($12,493)
2. Wealth transfer programs ($47,168)
3. Interest on debt for obligations some of which were most likely created before you could vote/were born ($3,704)
Now, here's what you're getting fairly directly
1. Actual infrastructure in the "who will build the roads!" sense. ($1,640)
2. NASA and some other fun stuff like research ($1,600)
3. The EPA ($536)
4. Defense (assuming that it can be done for what the next country with the next largest military (China) can do it for, plus the veterans affairs spending) ($3,682).
Also, some things actually have negative utility to what I value. Drug war, NSA wiretapping, online gambling being illegal, stuff like that.
I've said it over **20** times thus far, but let's look at what I'm actually using and where it comes from:
1. ROADZ!!!1!. Property tax, gasoline tax, tolls, and a small (~2%) amount from FedGov with strings attached (though I live in NH which is a donor state, so it's actually lower). Bitcoin doesn't make it easy to avoid property tax, gasoline tax, or tolls.
2. Police, Fire Dept. Property tax.
3. School/indoctrination camps. Property tax.
So, the type and scope of tax which gives the least benefit and over which one has the least control is the one which bitcoin makes easiest to avoid? Count me in.

And it costs less than having to back a petrodollar with a military. That's $682b on books for the U.S., subtract maybe $100b for *actual* defense, but then add in off books stuff and the Iraq/Afghanistan wars, easily $1t/yr.
144 \* 365.25 \* 25 = 1,314,900 approximate number of BTC mined in one year
= $760,514 per btc.

No, because elliptical curve points support three primitive operations: add, subtract, and double. Doubling a point involves taking a tangent line. Adding G two times to 2\*G would be two operations, but doubling 2\*G to get 4*G is a single operation.
So, the attacker would have to start with point G and then add G to it again and again until it was 20 times G, each time checking to see if the public key was correct. Unless he knew the private key was 20.
The person who knows that the private key is 20 just performs:
20G = ((((G\*2)\*2)+G)\*2)\*2) which is 5 operations. The larger the numbers, the more significant the operational savings.

It wouldn't, but property taxes have three advantages:
1. In the U.S. they are collected locally. While that could change, there'd probably be a big pushback since that's the bread and butter of local governments. If taxes are collected locally and remitted upwards, the federal government loses a lot of power because it has to place nice(r) to the local governments. There are few ways which this is not a win for libertarian types.
2. They are usually more visible which is one of the reasons why they're a more hated tax. I pay about $2,700 semi-annually. It's not stealthily removed from my paycheck. If the government fails to provide a reasonable value proposition for increased taxes, there'll be a lot more pushback from the citizenry than if hidden inflation, sales, and wage taxes increase.
3. The land portion of the property tax is [justifiably libertarian](and has the power to [stop one half of the boom-bust cycle]( Unlike other taxes which may be necessary to fund public goods at the expense of production, taxes on economic rent are either neutral to production or actually increase it *and* can fund public goods.

You can show that an algorithm given certain input must produce a certain output based on the rules and definitions of the input(s) and steps. That's almost tautology.
But the system itself cannot prove itself correct because its relying on the steps to prove its own validity to be valid. If your computer hardware were corrupt, your program might have produced output which made it appear to have successfully validated, but it'd be using steps which caused it to be right for the wrong reason.

Perhaps both groups of bitcoiners (the anarchists and the "to the moon" crowd) can win so long as decentralized exchanges can remain in the mix.
Regulated exchanges will offer recourse for funds lost due to negligence or theft. They'll probably be quicker and more efficient. But you'll have to give up your information and pay at least a capital gains tax. There could be additional *inconveniencing* restrictions such as limiting the hours of operation, who you can trade with, etc. Overall, I expect the bulk of users to use regulated exchanges because they will most likely be easier and more convenient.
Unregulated and, preferrably, decentralized exchanges will offer no recourse for funds, but will use technological means to attempt to get people to behave nicely (Nash Equillibrium, etc.). They'll be slower and less efficient (more network traffic, etc.). You'll be able to operate largely anonymously and there won't be formal restrictions on who you can trade with though there may be *practical* restrictions. No one will file a 1099 on your behalf, so if you don't want to support FedGov, you can avoid doing so. It'll almost certainly have lower fees (if it has any fees). It'll be less convenient since you'll have to make bank deposits, meet people, or mail cash.

The only aspect of TV that needs regulation is preventing conflicting broadcasts on scarce spectrum. Anything else can be censorship.


NOAA is one of the few federal programs I agree with and I believe it can be justified in the general welfare sense since EVERYONE benefits directly from it and a defensive military needs to know about the weather because that affects the ability to fight.


The FDA is worse than cancer. At best they should certify items or not, but in no way should they say what can't be released (except maybe in cases of people selling anthrax or something).


This is also pretty reasonable, and also costs about nothing.


Because no one would make safe cars otherwise instead of having to jump through a bunch of hoops.

The EPA is only justified in preventing pollution. If fuel is junk, but not more polluting than normal fuel, that's a consumer rights issue and can be handled locally.


The FED sucks. I know this is copypasta, but why praise the FED yet use bitcoin?


Allowed via the constitution. If congress didn't keep raiding the USPS' funds, they'd actually not cost taxpayers anything (except the opportunity costs of restrictions on competition).


Paid for out of property taxes, irrelevant to bitcoin because bitcoin doesn't allow evasion of such taxes.




Some codes are relevant, some are irrelevant. God forbid I know how to wire up my house but aren't licensed. If paid for at local or state levels, they are probably paid in large part by property taxes which bitcoin doesn't allow evasion of.


Same as above. Also worked really well for those people at the Great White concert in Rhode Island, which got a sign-off from the fire marshal (though the owners did overpack that venue).


Or, you know, good neighbors. But police are paid for out of property taxes, irrelevant to bitcoin because bitcoin doesn't allow evasion of such taxes.


Just because something was invented by someone doesn't mean you have to pay for it in perpetuity especially if it's been heavily extended by other people. Do you pay Newton's family every time you use calculus? Does the government pay the Wrights' families every time they use a plane?
Also, considering the money was taken without full consent of all participants, it makes using that argument even more specious.
If you eliminate all but 200b operating costs between FEDGOV and the military (which, if they took 110b is still more than China's military uses), that's 5.5% of $3.668 trillion.

Correct, we don't know if it's possible yet, but if it *can* work, then it can beat PoW in several ways. A better approach is not getting married to Proof of Stake, but to look at the problems with Proof of Work and see what solutions might be out there. If there *appear* to be solutions, then expend effort in trying to create them if the expected payoff is more than the expected amount of work.
My point was only that just because something doesn't exist, doesn't mean that no one can have reasonable expectations about it being better *if* it could be created.

Well, look at it this way...
1. Early adopters were mostly crypto-anarchists and other minarchist types which is, at best 3% of the population.
2. Bitcoin goes mainstream, but must become govcoin to do so.
3. Cryptoanarchists cash out (and pay taxes if they can't avoid it), but are now wealthy in fiat, land, or goods.
4. Cryptoanarchists can "anarchy" or make a new coin which is useful among them, though it won't get mainstream adoption.
TL;DR - I don't care about bitcoin really, I just want people to be free. If I get rich off of bitcoin, even if it becomes govcoin, I'm not going to complain because people, by buying bitcoin, are transferring wealth to crypto-anarchists.
Edit: not -&gt; now.

They don't really vote, there's no global tallying mechanism - they just work together or don't (cancer). I do agree that cells make decisions depending on how much you want to stretch that term.
Here's the thing, what the emergent intelligence wants and what cells want are *not the same thing*. This is highly likely to be the case with an emergent social intelligence relative to humans. Humans vote to achieve *human* goals.

@_date: 2014-02-13 15:58:42
I've been thinking about this for a while and there are two additional pieces I'd like to see solved.
The first, and less important one, is that *having* to have bitcoin (or some alt coin) to obtain bitcoin sucks, but appears to be necessary... though I don't think it is. What's necessary is that each individual put up something costly to create, easy-to-verify and reusable. It doesn't matter that it's fixed in supply, like bitcoin and many alt-coins; the first two conditions will suffice.
Why not allow reusable address tokens? People "mine" a key pair to get a public key hash below a certain target (based on the bitcoin network speed) so that the estimated cost to create it electricity-wise maps roughly to the effort to produce a bitcoin? Then people *without* bitcoins can buy bitcoins and bootstrap.
The second, and *more* important issue is that NashX and LocalBitcoins already exist. They are *technically* exchanges, but not in the sense that the other exchanges are. With the other exchanges, I can deposit funds, make any number of trades, and then withdraw funds. I don't have to meet someone and square up for cash every time I want to make a trade.
The gold standard of a decentralized exchange would be if one could sell or trade other trades and then square up *once in a while*. So, if Alice buys from Bob, then Alice and Bob have BTC tied up, and Alice has "virtual" bitcoin and Bob has "virtual" cash. Bob or Alice should be able to trade such virtual items with others and remap the obligations. For instance, if Bob wants to sell his virtual cash for more Bitcoin to Carl, then Carl now owes Alice some Bitcoin and owes Bob a presumably smaller amount of Bitcoin. Alice now has to send the cash to Carl instead of Bob. Once Alice initiates the actual "square up" in the form of mailing cash, a bank deposit, or meeting somewhere, then Carl can no longer sell Alice's obligation to a fourth party.
The latter wouldn't be very hard to implement in a centralized manner, but I'm not sure how it could be done P2P.

Based on [the analysis here]( the only way that I, as a resident of state outside of New York who has no business interests or investments in New York, I'm only willing to accept this scheme is with the caveats that:
\1. The provisions apply only to residents currently living in the state of New York or businesses which have a nexus in New York. For the purpose of this legislation, being accessible over the internet from residents and businesses in New York shall not constitute having a nexus in New York. Businesses and individuals who BitLicensing provisions do not apply to, as defined in this section, shall hereafter be referred to as OUT-OF-JURISDICTION ENTITIES.
\2. OUT-OF-JURISDICTION ENTITIES *may* block New York residents and businesses at their own expense. They *may not* knowingly serve New York residents or businesses. The following measures shall, for the purposes of this section, constitute blocking:
* Denial based on IP address and IP ranges
* A message indicating that residents and businesses in New York cannot use the system, and requiring the user declare that (s)he is not a resident of, nor represents a business in New York.
* The product is software with no concept of users or with no user interface
OUT-OF-JURISDICTION ENTITIES who choose to comply do not have to block New York residents or businesses from all parts of their sites or services, just the portions which would require a BitLicense.
\3. Entities, within or without the jurisdiction of New York (as defined in section  do not control or othewise operate a business requiring a BitLicense if they do not know the private keys or other information required by the design of the virtual currency to transfer funds.
\4. No software development, releases, or contributions to development of new cryptocurrencies or enhancements on existing cryptocurrencies shall, whether taking place within or without New York, be prohibited nor require licensing.
Not perfect, but I got no sleep last night. Now let's run through 's list.


Only if those businesses have a nexus in New York per  If they do not, then they are indemnified by either not having a user interface (e.g. apis) or requiring a declaration of non-residency.

So... beliefs? You believe that others will want those items either for the properties you listed or for other reasons. There's no guarantee you'd be right about that. Furthermore, you probably wouldn't value the money item for its own sake, but because you could get rid of it. If you didn't expect others would accept it, then you wouldn't be able to value that money as a means of exchange (it wouldn't be "value-able").
The properties you listed are important in determining what tends to become money, but it still depends on belief that others will accept it. People could choose to value a different set of properties and then those properties would do nothing to make money with the original set of properties a valued item in exchange.

You forget about one very powerful and under-discussed use for bitcoin which could help nip this in the bud if enough people care about bitcoin as something beyond a get rich scheme: [deadpools](
Right now most bitcoins are black. Black coin holders who care about privacy and the "soul of bitcoin" have an incentive for their coins to remain black but also useful. Thus there is a market to ensure that's the case. People pushing for or implementing legislation which promotes the discrimination scenario you discuss - especially penalties on individuals, are good candidates to be on a kill list.
The other way this could go is to have the entire clear list be public. If I ran an exchange which was under these rules, I'd talk with all other exchanges into at least fucking the senators over. If I can't have a black address, then Comcast donating to a senator is public too.
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:04:38
The first two mean centralization. That can happen in the bitcoin world too, but in a different way:
1. Gavin and crew get corrupted and enough people just trust "the official client"
2. Miner collusion / big miners
\ is a problem if the code and rules are hard to understand, but if enough people are able to check the open source code for themselves, it's *less* bad. That's no PoW/PoS specific - that's just the cost of using a computer.
\ I think is a big problem for Bitcoin though it's not necessarily a problem for all cryptos which use PoW
The third one has known fairly easy attack vectors such as botnets.
In the end, I might be too demanding of PoS. Decentralization, to me, is paramount. If it means a cryptocurrency needs its own nuclear power plant to run, I'd rather have that than a centralized system.

Arms sales could be good or bad. Blackmail isn't bad from a libertarian standpoint based on first principles (two rights don't make a wrong), though it can often be bad from a social cohesion/trust standpoint. The rest of them are bad. The question I have though, is what cost are you willing to pay to eliminate them?

My cheap "coffee shop scenario" which still has a POS was that you run an app on the phone - blockchain.info whatever. You enter an alias like "Justin K". When you're within bluethooth range of the POS, you appear on the list of customers. The sales can be rung up and "piped" to that user. Your phone buzzes. You see the receipt or at least the total and hit "okay." Done. All of that is feasible now.

Seriously, I'm sick of the ROADS rebuttal. Have these people even looked at the federal expenditure pie chart? We're talking single digits to roads and education. Local taxes, gas taxes, and tolls pay for the roads with maybe a tiny fraction kicked in from the feds (who took the money out of state by taxing residents in the first place, so it's at best a wash).
They should be saying "don't use defense, or medicare/medicaid, or social security!" to which I'd say "fine." But they can't. They have to pick the few things that most people are okay with the government doing, which make up a tiny fraction of taxes overall and especially at the federal level and are taxed by means most disrupted if bitcoin displaces fiat transactions.
Gas taxes, property taxes, and tolls are pretty unavoidable and bitcoin won't displace those. Those also fund nearly 100% of police, firefighter, school, and road costs.

Well, yes, people who want to ascribe a meaning of ownership onto the code implicitly agree with a method for tying the code's output to a concept of ownership.
There's no getting out of trust completely, but I'd like to minimize trust in humans as regards currency. There are a lot of parts of messages which can be faked. For instance, I can forge a datestamp at near zero cost. If I'm a new node connected to some honest nodes and some dishonest nodes, how do I determine the correct allocation of coins without a "blessed" node or checkpoint? Satoshi solved that problem by statistically tying it to energy usage in the real world which can't be faked (unless SHA256 and RIPEMD160 can be reversed).

Privacy is a mixed bag - especially when conflated with anonymity.
Do I think people should be able to live their lives as separately from society as they want to? With minor qualifications, yes.
Do I think people should be able to demand that others don't use their eyes or ears or spread the truth about something / own information? No.
Do I think that it's a good thing for Bitcoin or another crypto to be more anonymous because:
1. If I want to buy drugs that doesn't hurt anyone
2. If I don't want to fund drone strikes that is the exact opposite of hurting someone
3. It's none of the government's business where I spend money; I'll be more likely to give all my info to the state when the state tells me where all the tax dollars go and what's off budget.
4. It hurts the ability to collect the type of taxes which approximate slavery (wage, sales) and would hypothetically force governments to collect ground rents (wherein such taxes are the OPPOSITE of slavery) or user fees/tolls/gas taxes/pollution taxes. Bonus is that most of those type of taxes pay for MOST of the public goods the average citizen uses day-to-day.
Do I think it's a bad thing for financial anonymity? Yeah, somewhat because:
1. People can do shitty things without paying social costs
2. Coming out of the closet can make things get done faster. Recent examples are with pot and homosexuality. It's easy to decry someone when they're "the other." But I bet even cartoonishly evil Dick Cheney has a hard time decrying homosexuality when his own daughter is a lesbian. It's not that hiding the purchase of drugs or fully automatic rifles is the problem, it's that doing those things is illegal. If they weren't illegal, lack of anonymity wouldn't be so important.

(Also, if a corporation commits a crime, put it in jail by building a fence around the building - again at least run the metaphor all the way.)
2. All monetary amounts are inflation-adjusted to when the law was made. Let's say the CTR law was made in 1980. That's $10,000 in **1980's** dollars which means no CTR below $28,485.68 (per [this]( This should also affect the [standard deduction]( which appears to be farting around at 1% increase per year.

That said, if Bitcoin hit the market now, it'd deserve to fail because, as a developer trying to build apps around it, it's inferior to some of the other offerings and it has underaddressed problems.
It's got the network effect and first mover advantage, but that just buys the dev team time to make some fixes, it doesn't allow Bitcoin to coast and the developers of the non-scam, non-clone altcoins are at least exploring the space of possibility.
I disagree that it's winner take all, though I think there'll be relatively few winners due to the network effect. Mainstream businesses could easily accept FiatCoin while Silk Road version X accepts something more anonymous; there'd be a market for both.

I hate to bring this up because I don't want to naysay bitcoin projects, but this suffers from the *same 2 problems* which plague all such attempts:
1. You need bitcoin to buy bitcoin
2. No day trading
Number one is a non-starter. Sorry, it just is.
Number two is a market demand. A full 30% of bitcoiners would entrust Mark Knaples their coins again if Mt. Gox reopened and started trading.
Both of these problems have solutions, and I'll be pushing something out to BitBucket shortly (&lt; 2 months)

By some metrics of ownership, and not all governments arose the same way. The U.S. arose from conquest by the Normans of the U.K. establishing the monarchy and then colony grants by The King of England, then a revolt which lead to the king making agreements with each of the 13 colonies, then The Constitution as a replacement of The Articles of Confederation.
The issue is that everyone has to be somewhere. Either find a way to allow that without conflict or don't complain when conflict happens.
The problem with "[royal libertarians]( is they end up arguing about whether the government (or at least people acting under the auspices of the government) own the land or not instead of whether love it or leave it is [bullshit]( They can't win that argument while still seeking to maintain the privilege that their opposing in the government.
Of course, people could argue that any system is or is not valid depending on the metric one uses. The compensation for exclusion solution I propose is definitely egalitarian, but also allows for broad and nuanced expressions of liberty in a "thousand nations" sense. But, people are free to use violence or persuasion to get others in line and I won't make any meta-judgments on that. Still, I think it's silly to expect people to not use violence if doing so is a cheaper option than the alternatives.

It takes time for people to learn to be personally responsible and to establish trust outside of threats of punishment.


I think that's currently true. I think it was also true (and in some cases IS also true) that, without a belief in a deity who'll punish individuals for being bad, people would live in a less than third world tribal state. I deny the existence of the referrent "god" in the belief system "theism." I deny the existence of the referrent "will of the people" in the belief system "statism." But the beliefs themselves do affect behavior and can have positive consequences relative to the alternatives.
Statism is probably currently necessary, but it might not be in all situations even at populations above Dunbar's Number. Technology and changing norms and social structures can and do have powerful effects. Is Bitcoin in specific or cryptocurrencies in general the nail in the coffin for statism? No. But they *may* be part of a method of achieving escape velocity out of the current paradigm attractor and into a new stable configuration.

1) What is a bitcoin- what am I transferring to a usb stick when I choose to take my bitcoins offline?
1. A bitcoin doesn't exist in any direct sense. It's a unit, just like meters, feet, degrees, etc. You are transferring one or more private keys to your USB stick. These keys are neccessary to solve a cryptographic puzzle to transfer units in a distributed ledger from one cryptographic puzzle (address) to another,
2. You definitely are. There is no 100% safe online solution, though things like Trezor are probably the most safe due to the small [attack surface]( Web wallets are particularly dangerous because, for instance, blockchain.info could change the JS to capture your password and unless you had the network tab open in Firebug or one of the equivalent tools, you probably wouldn't notice. To be fair, I also have funds in a blockchain.info wallet, but not much.
3. My understanding is that they'll hand you an encrypted wallet based on your identifier and your password is used in the browser (client-side) to decrypt it. This means that blockchain couldn't decrypt your wallet even if they wanted to (without capturing your password). My understanding may be incorrect.
4. There are no bitcoins. There are only cryptographic puzzles (inputs/outputs) which have a number (denominated in bitcoin as a unit) associated with them. An address is a cryptographic puzzle with zero or more matching inputs. A wallet is a collection of zero or more solutions to cryptographic puzzles.
5. It might not broadcast to all nodes. A transaction is pretty much decrease address(es) by X, increase address(es) by Y &lt;= X. At a deeper level, it's finding unspent inputs, solving a cryptographic puzzle required to consume value from those inputs, and creating new puzzle(s) for the value (outputs)
6. We don't. There are 2**256 possible values for a SHA256. Whether or not it covers all of them is beyond my math capabilities. Good hashes have a property of fairly even distribution. If SHA256 is good, then there shouldn't be certain output values which are much more common than others. The nonce and extra nonce fields are 64 bits, or 128 bits between the two. A miner can also jiggle transactions and the coinbase around to create additional hashes. If SHA256 was not producing output in a certain range, then that could be a huge problem for Bitcoin and the hashing algorithm used would likely have to be changed. This would only be a major problem if it appeared suddenly. Otherwise hashing would just be more difficult and the difficulty would end up lowering sort of solving the problem.
7. Blocks can be empty currently. (Actually, I'm not sure if it requires 1 transaction for the coinbase or not.) I consider this a bad design.
8. Ownership in bitcoin is [not the normative type of ownership]( Computers can't verify norms or deterine what SHOULD be the case in some moral sense.  All it can verify is that a transaction met the requirements of the protocol. Whoever can produce such a transaction *owns* the bitcoins according to the protocol regardless of whether humans would consider such ownership valid. Strictly by the protocol, bitcoins cannot be stolen any more than someone telling a joke "steals" it from whoever they heard it from.

The IRS, like all bureaucracies, does the minimum it needs to survive and the people in it do what they need to do to justify their job to their superiors.

Only if it hits your bank account. If you can sell in person or at an ATM (and fake the KYC), then the IRS won't know shit.
The other thing about the IRS is that they're going to go after the easiest things first unless they need to make a political example of someone. Finding small income disparities for auditing is difficult and may actually end up with them OWING the person money, or at least wasting the agent's time. If you don't sell through a KYC exchange, you're not guaranteed to be safe, but you're probably safer than 90% of the rest. In the case of audits, you don't have to "outrun the bear" you just have to "outrun the slowest person."

Gold is *useful* to certain ends, but those ends being valued is not intrinsic.
@_date: 2019-11-11 14:32:35
The whole "gold is used in electronics" is true, but is a boomer take. The industrial uses of gold aren't what's driving the price up that high.
@_date: 2019-11-11 14:39:29
Intrinsic also requires for the property to be within itself, otherwise it's extrinsic or dependent. Gold is a good conductor of electricity as a function of its elemental structure. That's intrinsic.
Value isn't intrinsic to the thing being valued. Its suitability toward an end may be considered fundamental, but whether that end is valued depends on valuers. This should be easy to see when you consider that *everything* is useful for *something*.
Bitcoin has properties which are useful to ends which are valued by humans. Take away humans, and what happens to bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-11 19:27:36

The use IS valued, and the properties which make it useful are intrinsic. What is valued can change and is also subject to competition. Horses didn't stop having properties useful for transportation, it's just that cars are better relative to what most people want. If the value is actually *inside* of the horse, then the market, which is *extrinsic* to the horse, can't change that property of a horse.
Ultimately, this is a philosophical discussion and a debate about definitions.

1. Was this an actual money laundering attempt? If the guy just cashed out bitcoin without trying to hide anything, that shouldn't count as laundering. I know that laws don't have to make sense - but they should.
2. The law against profiting from crime is dumb. The crime is the issue; charge the guy for selling drugs, not for making money from selling drugs. Again, I can sort of see why this exists since it makes the prosecution's job easier, but it also can be abused.
3. How do they know he wasn't just selling normal stuff on Silk Road. While it was mostly drugs, it people sold books and other things on there. I'm sure that he WAS selling drugs to amass 4000 BTC, but what evidence do they have?

Some workplace safety standards are bullshit, some aren't. *All* wage standards which set some sort of minimum are bullshit. Pollution standards are fine within reason; all human activity is going to pollute, the government can rightfully ensure that the market is internalized.
There was a documentary a while ago about some large company which wanted to manufacture in the U.S. and was (supposedly) willing to pay workers a U.S.-level wage, but it would take years to spin up a factory here whereas you can just go to China and they'll have you up and running in a month. I'm sure they're cutting corners there on safety, pollution, and other externalities, but there has to be some sort of balance - regulations raise prices, and the cost of that is either higher consumer prices or outsourcing. Both of those options hurt citizens.
If people supporting tariffs were honest, they'd apply the tariffs then give the money to the Chinese workers since they're the ones getting screwed by lack of safety standards. Anything else is protectionism which is kind of lame.

That's not how supply and demand work. One or more of the following happens when wage floors are put into place:
1. Disemployment effects - firing people, less hours worked for existing employees, less likely to hire new people
2. Reduction in other benefits for employees - which is essentially clawing back the raise
3. Price increases in goods and services
4. Reduction in profit
Whether  occurs depends on how thin the profit margins already are. In a lot of what people consider minimum wage work such as fast food, the margins are either thin or there are so many employees that multiplying a wage increase by hours worked over the year requires 1,2, or 3.

If the client could be configured to refuse/automatically return "tainted" bitcoins as listed by one or more boycott services which individuals can choose to accept the validity of. If someone wants to buy something from you and they send you 100BTC only 90 of which are good, you send the 10 back and ask for 10 more before completing the transaction.
Since the entire blockchain is public, tainted coins or tainted values can be followed throughout the system.
The current problems with this proposal are:
1. Bitcoin is primarily a speculation platform at the moment.
2. Not having identities makes boycotting harder, though boycotts can always be retroactive.

If enough people boycott something then the rest of the community doesn't have to be overly-principled since they have an incentive to refuse bad coins too (since others won't accept them).
Since a large amount of transactions are currently happening within Mt. Gox I don't think this system will have a large effect... *yet*, but it has the potential to solve problems that are much bigger than mere theft.

Inasmuch as bitcoin is currently primarily a speculation platform, yes. When trading in bitcoin becomes more prevalent, I see something like this as one of the answers anarcho-capitalism has been looking for (whether they know it or not). For instance, the standard "how will you bring large corporations to court under anarchy?" problem.
The only two solutions I can see to governance are centralized or distributed power. The latter requires that people are informed and can take effective decentralized action. While anonymity prevents the former, technology will likely bring about a [the transparent society]( That presumably lowers the cost of being informed though information overload is a real possibility. The latter can be implemented by something like my solution.
Boycotting money is entirely voluntary as is accepting boycotted money. The problem remains about determining identity (both a strength and a weakness of bitcoin).
@_date: 2012-03-22 21:18:51
People should be free to accept Bitcoins or not, or some Bitcoins or not. Treating money as fungible is what leads to a bunch of financial bullshit because both stolen money and earned money are "green." If stolen money was worthless, then there'd be far less incentive to steal.
MtGox's real sin in my opinion was taking a commission on the sale and allowing it to go through. They should list or otherwise indicate that which they will not accept.  I don't think bitcotts will hurt the system that much and it has the potential, if done correctly, to make things better. There's no reason why the client can't have hooks to reference external sites which could track tainted money. If you're trying to pay me 100BTC for something and 20 of it's "bad," then I'll just send you that 20 back and you gotta send me another 20 before I'll sell you something. This can all be automated.
Notice the OP says


Does he really want to get the legal system involved? Every day it seems that people ignore what Bitcoin can offer and want to turn it into either a speculative tool, Western Union with lower fees, or a slightly better (in some regards) but far less convenient credit card system.

From a website, a bitcoin protocol hyperlink would probably be easier. As far as mobile goes, QR isn't bad for certain things - donating money to causes listed on posters, they're cheap to produce, etc. NFC or bluetooth (possibly) seems better to me. Third-party solutions which can figure out what you're trying to pay for (gives you a list or something) by your location or by your wifi connection is another possibility in the interim.
What I'd like to see is I go into Breaking New Grounds (a nearby coffee shop). I place my order and either swipe via NFC and it's taken care of. Until NFC, I connect to a site/launch an app from which I can pick Breaking New Grounds (list of options constrained by what I'm near) and then it gives me a list of orders (presuming there are multiple people trying to pay with Bitcoin at the same time) e.g. "Order for Justin". I click pay and the correct amount of funds are transferred to the address via the third party site.

I was presuming something like Ripple where you've already built up a reputation.

The key difference is that one must invest hashing power in their own names (or pay someone else to do it). Names can be cheap to obtain, but must be computationally expensive to hold to reduce squatting. This comes at the expense of name stability but, if one really values something more than others, they should be willing to invest more computational power to secure it
@_date: 2012-02-16 18:05:56
I see both as different parts of a system of value exchange. Ripple is the social credit and web-of-trust aspect. I don't really see Bitcoin working for non-in-person transactions without a trust layer. You don't see people mailing cash to people over the internet.
At the same time, Ripple needs something on which to operate. The last protocol I saw had provisions for different currencies, precious metals, energy, etc. Bitcoin is just another currency, it just happens to be a cryptographically solid non-commodity currency.
While either could be used alone, I think there are advantages to running Ripple *on* Bitcoin.

@_date: 2012-08-25 12:26:25
My first impression is something similar to the UOT but without requiring miners to maintain the tree. I think UOT is probably a better system - and certainly better thought out than my thought experiment.
I was thinking of having a merkle tree where each set of nodes is sorted by hash, so the lower hash is always on the left. Each blocks makes the tree deeper, but neither the miner nor the clients have to store it. The miner does have to announce the block to get paid and the owners of coins must be aware of where their transaction is in the tree. Thick clients or services can store everything or just recent stuff so that clients don't have to be connected until blocks with their transaction are announced.
Block headers would also have to have a trim array with the binary path of nodes to remove. When someone wanted to spend coins they'd have to announce a transaction with:
1. The spend criteria of all inputs
2. The amount of all inputs
3. A scriptsig
4. The outputs
5. The relevant part of the merkle tree to root of the block it was originally in
6. The block it was originally in
It's easy to check that, at the time of that block, the item was there and that the spend criteria are met. Then one has to walk the block headers from then to now looking for anything which trims out that branch. If the branch is trimmed, then it's spent and it's invalid, otherwise it's ok.
Miners don't need to store past trees because they can build the trim for an included transaction by looking at the transactions merkle proof. Since the tree is sorted at each level, it's trivial to figure out which steps of left and right are required to trim out that branch.
Thin clients couldn't prove that past inputs were legitimate without reference but, so long as enough clients refuse to accept blocks which aren't legitimate *at that point*, a new history should overtake the bad history. If bad blocks are allowed to slip in and no one is noticing, then they can be built off of and no one will have the information necessary to challenge them later.
1. Space - the necessary data to store could be reduced by a factor of at least 90% and it scales relatively constantly with transactions.
2. Possibly more anonymity - if people don't store deep history
1. Network traffic - each miner must announce a far bigger block since all the transactions can't just reference an input hash, they'd have to carry all their relevant information. However, older full blocks wouldn't have to be broadcast around the network so it might be a wash.
2. Disconnected spending - this is the biggest disadvantage and is what kills the proposal (not that I'd expect the bitcoin community to adopt it - it was just a "bored on Friday thought experiment.") In order for a buyer to have proof to a seller, they need to wait until a miner includes their transaction and they should wait until it's unlikely to be reversible. That can undermine anonymity because now I need to announce a transaction to miners and then get my proof of inclusion to the buyer possibly by some means outside the system unless they are listening to network traffic at the time of the inclusion or there are services which store full blocks. That eliminates 0 confirmation transactions.
So, yeah, not great, but a thought experiment.
The blockchain will become a problem over time and I don't want to have to deal with supernodes unless there are tons of them. Consolidation of trust is what led to the current fiat system (well that and force).
@_date: 2012-03-23 19:13:10


I don't. Bitcoin is an experiment in market currency and currency by consensus.


Whoever people want to believe. There doesn't need to be one service.


That's up to an individual list compilation service.


*Probably* not, though there would probably end up being a few big players in such a system. People seem to be using MtGox instead of web-of-trust systems which indicates that such systems, while dangerous, are prone to use.


You don't, but the taintedness level should be proportionate to the funds ratio. If a miner gets 50BTC for generation + 0.5 bad BTC for a transaction fee, then (s)he'd have 50.5 BTC at a tainted concentration of &lt; 1%. (S)he could "remove the curse" by sending the money back or through a clearing address.
The technical feasibility of such a system is greater than the social feasibility.

It's more decentralized, so that's better, but it's still highly squattable, which I find problematic. Yes, people in the early days of the internet could buy up names on the cheap and have found ways to continuously register them at bargain prices. If such people had to expend serious effort to keep names, then it would free up names for their best uses (as expressed by the costs people are willing to bear). While speculation and arbitrage works this way now, there is a first come luck component which disadvantages late comers.
I realized there's a small flaw at the end of my PDF, I'll upload a revised version shortly. It's true that people could squat in my proposed system, too, it'd just be harder - especially for names which were highly contentious. There'd be no fixed price per domain, the hashing requirements are greater for contentious names simply because more people are working to have the highest "hash bid."
I admit the need for a balance between stability and cost accuracy. My paper used a year as the award. People could squat on a name for a year if they make it past the two week announcement period. There's ultimately no way to eliminate domain name squatting entirely, and it's not necessarily a horrible thing. My proposal is just an alternative for people who have issues with it.
The having to go to pools (eventually as hashing became too hard) to get a name renewal is scary. There'll be pressure for people to break cartel behavior, but I'd still rather the power of domain name registration and renewal be as decentralized as possible.
Under my proposal, if I want to register justopia.bit, I probably don't have to worry about getting blocked out because the large pools will be spending their efforts on mining amazon.bit or something. Neither of us has to ask the other permission to register our respective names.

In addition to the reasons the author provides, I'd  argue that Bitcoin is better than gold because it's not already primarily in the hands of states, though that could change later of course.
It also doesn't depend on those who happen to own gold-rich land and mines which can cause supply problems and cartels. With Bitcoin pretty much anyone can buy a computer and either mine solo or join a pool - no one can prevent them like they could by refusing to sell a mine or mined gold.

Why doesn't it with electronics? If you buy a computer now you're a sucker because they'll be better and cheaper next year. Eventually you *have to use currency to eat*. That's the short answer.
Unfortunately it might not apply with bitcoin. With computers and food you don't have a convenient, more inflationary currency to use as an alternative (spending foreign currency at the stores you want to buy from isn't an option). With bitcoin you do - your national currency. It's quite possible that people will simply shift holdings into bitcoin just to save, not consume for that reason. Then again, I'm not an economist.

It doesn't work well for trading bitcoins for money within site, but for goods and services, it's fine. You send me crappy money and I say nah, and send the money back before sending you any products or performing any services. There's no reason the client can't provide hooks for 3rd party services so I can tell you're paying me with widely-hated bitcoins as soon as you make a transfer.
You could report the coins as stolen, but few would probably believe you. Reputable crime detection and adjudication agencies could have a role to play... at least that's the an-cap perspective.
I'm not saying this system works now, only that it's a possibility. Due to the anonymous nature of Bitcoin and the difficulty of proving any crime even happened, it's problematic. However, I can see something like this working quite well in a charter city which used Bitcoin as a currency. Presumably everyone in the charter city would need to pay taxes (at least land taxes / rent). The charter city could demand payment from a certain bitcoin address. This creates an identity and a need to obtain bitcoin.
People might also desire to have an address recognized by the government because others might accept coins from it without waiting for 6 confirmations so long as the government will punish the individual for double spends.
Suppose there's a registry where people can publicly announce that they won't accept money from X address for whatever reason until block Y. Now the government will not accept tax money from them in proportion to the tainted amount. Note that the government still accepts it from that individual, just not from individuals who have said they won't take it.
The more people against someone or something, the less good that person's money is considered to be. Sure, you might get a few racists or something trying to screw over people of races which they didn't like, but it'd have very little effect since there'd be so few of them. Much more people would be against things like murder, theft, not showing up to court. 
The client can easily be made to return crappy coins to sender or to a clearing address. Sure, someone can send you money without your approval. So what? If I had 1000BTC and got 100 bad BTC, I now have 1100 of which 10/11th is generally considered good. I'm no worse off if people want to send me free money to try to pollute me.
This scenario is a million miles away from the OP's MtGox situation (which was extremely poorly handled since they took the commission), but its in the same spirit as bitcoin - a decentralized system of value transfer and rule enforcement.
@_date: 2012-03-22 20:15:01
[I proposed something like this a while ago]( Done correctly, tracking and not accepting tainted coins is a way for the bitcoin community to self-police without a central power structure - and no, it's not the same as a chargeback, but MtGox is going about this in a douchey way.
They shouldn't have allowed you to purchase any of the tainted coins, or allowed the seller to sell them.

How the hell is going to the bank instant or anonymous? The only things I've seen thus far which meet those criteria are:
1. Mine them yourself
2. Know a miner personally (not anonymous nor really that instant)
3. [Web of trust]( - not anonymous but functionally instant.
I don't think total anonymity is the end all. So long as the trail is really hard to uncover (especially for the government) it's probably good enough.

@_date: 2012-01-10 20:10:55
I've been wondering this too - and I've also been tackling what are a few problems I feel exist with namecoin. I strongly dislike centralization: if I had to pick between anonymity and decentralization, I'd give up the anonymity of the system first.
One thing I've been wondering is if the entire blockchain really needs to be stored. If enough people verify things as they happen, then the head block should end up being valid even if no one has a complete history all the way back to the genesis block (other than block headers).
People who have coins and want to spend them can prove that they are valid by keeping all the parent branches and sibling nodes of their merkle tree to prove that they were in a previous block and, so long as enough people are watching the transactions, are probably legit if no one's caught it by now. Since they get the value, it's fair to ask them to pony up the additional storage.
There are a few problems with this approach. The first is it increases the size of a transaction since one must pass all the "reconstruction hashes" of their transaction inputs. Secondly, one can't simply receive money at an address without an active client watching within a certain window since clients could implement a rolling full blockchain (where, say, only the last 2000 blocks are stored, and the rest are headers). From headers alone, one can't tell what accounts exist and have which funds. Thirdly, it may impact some of the other uses of the blockchain such as for smart property and assurance contracts.
@_date: 2012-05-24 14:54:26

Justification is based on me saying things that others agree with - hopefully true things. People who accept that two rights can't make a wrong are *forced* into the position that blackmail isn't wrong unless they add in another factor or abandon that maxim.
1. I have a right to tell people things I find out unless I'm under contract not to (free speech). There are certain exceptions which I mostly disagree with, but generally free speech prevails.
2. I have a right to ask for money to perform certain services so long as the services are not illegal. Note that 2 being illegal can't be defined in terms of 2 without recursion. Charitably, asking for money defaults to ok unless there's a good reason for it to not be ok.
So, if:
1. telling people about Romney's tax records is ok (if they didn't steal it, I'd say it would be) and
2. asking for money to not do something annoying (like paint my house which is next to yours bright pink) is ok then
1+2 is ok. There's no "bad element."
Seeing as how I'm not on trial, I don't have to care what a judge thinks and what a judge thinks is not relevant to the above point. One can reject 1 or 2 or introduce a contextual 3, 4, or 5 and come to different conclusions. That's their prerogative. Seeing as how bitcoin is pretty anonymous, the blackmailer (presuming the whole thing isn't a scam) doesn't need to care what a judge thinks either.
I've been pretty disappointed in bitcoin fans lately - I feel it really **should** be a libertarian currency. Speculation is boring (even though I made bank last year on bitcoin). Easy transactions - cool but there are way easier ways. Breaking the backs of the banks, forcing governments to resort to taxing land instead of income and sales (which is what they should be doing anyways), being able to buy drugs with less hassle from the man - these are what I'm most excited about.

That happens with credit cards and, to a lesser degree, cash now (accidentally holding counterfeits, trying to pay for a pizza with a jar of pennies) and they remain supremely popular. Though cash is by government decree. Credit cards are just very convenient.
If I subscribe to popular lists, I won't hold tainted coins. Your point is taken though, it probably would undermine acceptance of the currency somewhat. I see a lot of promise in it though for putting the power of action in the hands of individuals. That probably couldn't happen outside of a charter city or jurisdiction where bitcoin was required for taxes in effect forcing people to use the currency.
So, I think the idea has merit, but it's probably not a good idea for the *current* bitcoin community. No chargebacks means caveat emptor.

All value is subjective. The short answer is that bitcoin has value to people who believe it does and it doesn't to people who don't believe it does. The objective part is bitcoin is effective of certain ends. It has all the properties which the gold bugs say makes good currency *except* intrinsic value - but intrinsic value doesn't exist anyways since, repeating myself, *all value is subjective*. If all value is subjective, it is found in the agent, not the thing itself which means it can't be *intrinsic* to that object. If that *wasn't* the case, then value would be empirically discoverable in an object itself. Fisher scientific doesn't sell a "value detector" so far as I'm aware.
The reasons why people ascribe value to bitcoin are varied and are not important in the abstract. However, if one wants to delve deeper here are some of the reasons which lead to people valuing bitcoin:
bitcoin is good for exchange (as mentioned above), it's hard to shut down, it can't be inflated arbitrarily, it's fairly anonymous, it's neat, using it is a potential way to stick it to the man, the math is really cool, people believe the dollar will devalue relative to bitcoin, people believe others will accept it in the future, etc.

True, Ripple doesn't need Bitcoin, but Ripple has a huge bootstrapping problem. Ripple has been around for years and it's gone pretty much nowhere. Bitcoin came on the scene "effectively" (as in semi-mainstream) in June 2010 and it's probably the most successful digital currency ever (even including corporate-backed Flooz and Beenz). Bitcoin is fully auditable which helps build trust and allows for some really neat solutions to things. I believe both Ripple and Bitcoin have their place.

@_date: 2012-02-16 12:20:01
That's not how Ripple-like systems work: you don't have to wait for each person in the chain to square up with the person before them. As soon as your BTC is sold, your friend owes you money, and others owe him money. That others haven't squared up with him yet doesn't mean he doesn't owe you money now. You can square up with him as quickly as he can get the money to you. Similarly, you can buy BTC on the credit you have with your friend and then square up with him later.
Getting money in could theoretically be instant, though how long it took for you to get money to your friend could take a bit. Taking money out depends on how quickly your friend can turn things around. Even if it takes a day or so, that's still faster than Dwolla.
The only thing this would hurt is speculation where people buy and sell bitcoins without actually cashing out. Even then, a Ripple-like system allows you to decrease your outstanding obligations to your friends by taking on obligations on their behalf, so floating credit could probably function well enough to allow speculation.

@_date: 2012-02-14 17:14:17
Not saying demurrage is a good idea, but I'd propose something different...
Bitcoins are only valid if they are in a transaction within the past X blocks (say 1 or 2 years worth). After that, they fall off, and whoever mines the next block gets the normal reward plus the dead bitcoins.
This would reduce the need to eliminate to store the entire blockchain and would probably be better at keeping things manageable than pruning. In order to keep one's bitcoins, all someone has to do is send their bitcoins to themselves before those bitcoins die. I'd expect this would merge coins from a bunch of addresses down to one reducing fanout. It also solves the lost bitcoin "problem" and reduces the complaints against early adopters.
There'd always be almost 21 million bitcoins in existence. As people die or otherwise stop using bitcoin, their coins are recycled into the system after a few years.
Again, I don't claim this is a good idea, but it's at least interesting.
@_date: 2012-10-25 20:25:07

Value is a relationship between reasons for action or means and a state of affairs, it exists entirely in the mind. Bitcoin's value is people's perceptions of Bitcoin. As it relates to currency, it's a belief that others will accept it later. The Bitcoin system may have properties which help foster that belief and may indirectly be responsible for value, but ultimately value exists in the mind.
Any law related to the transmission of belief in what is valued, especially true belief, appears to be an infringement on the exchange of ideas. While perhaps legal, I'd argue it to be immoral.
Lastly, no regulations matter if one is not provably in possession of bitcoins.

Ideally local miners could deposit funds with the store, but it's kind of a chicken and egg problem if the store owner doesn't want to buy upfront. If I were a miner, I'd rather sell where I can get the most customers or find a way to tentatively sell to all stores simultaneously with whoever makes the first sale removing those coins from the pool.
I can see some ways of doing this without centralization, but I'm not sure they're great.
This is where multisig is critical. Miners could put funds into a store account which they can withdraw from. All store owners would have a key, and they could withdraw from the account too, but there'd be a record of who made the withdrawal, so the miners could know who to square up with later.
This could probably be worked around for now in other ways until the multisig BIPWARS comes to a conclusion.

All coins have to either come from a combination of previous coins or be awarded to miners when they solve a block.
To redeem coins which already exist you need to supply a script signature which fulfills the rules the previous person put on redeeming the coin. It's much more difficult to figure out than it is to verify and everyone can verify it. An artificially simple example is if I were to offer money to anyone who can tell me a 7 letter thing which goes fast and is also a palindrome. It's harder to figure out "racecar" than it is to see that that fulfills the conditions. Of course the actual math is ridiculously more unequal in cost to find an answer (unless you already have the answer and tell the person sending you the money part of it) versus verifying an answer.
That redeemer can then create his/her own conditions which others must fulfill to redeem the coin. You can combine and split up coins so long as the new value isn't higher than the sum of all redeemed value.
That solves the first part of people creating bitcoins arbitrarily. The second part is a reward for solving blocks - that is finding a number which, when combined with a summary of a certain list of transactions (which themselves have to be valid) makes a number smaller than a veritably-fair difficulty number.
Since blocks can be forked, people who are rewarded with mined coins are not able to spend them for a while (I forget the number of blocks, but it's pretty high - like 100) to make sure that the chances of them not being the official winner of "the race to find the block" are so small so as to be effectively zero.
You can't create coins in the first situation, you'd have to actually solve the puzzles others laid out and snag their coins. That's still practically impossible but, even if it were possible, it wouldn't be creation of coins.
In the second case, one would have to solve a bunch of blocks which is mathematically difficult since the output of a hash jumps all over the place with varying input. A good metaphor would be that, in order to redeem a block, one must spray a bunch of paint on a canvas haphazardly and create a fairly accurate reproduction of the Mona Lisa. It's possible and, if you do it a bunch of times you're more likely to get it than someone who only does it once, but it's still going to take a long time. Furthermore, if a bunch of people start getting pictures of the Mona Lisa too quickly (&gt; 1 block per 10 minutes) then the bar can be raised to demand that the resulting haphazard painting looks even *more* like the Mona Lisa which makes it less likely.
Hopefully my weird metaphors weren't too weird.
Bitcoin is "currency by consensus." Bitcoin software recognizes the rules of bitcoin creation and redeemability and whether any given bitcoin or claim on a bitcoin meets those rules. It can (and does) refuse to consider bitcoins not meeting those rules as valid.

Bitcoin has a ways to go to become more useful. Most people care about convenience over anonymity and decentralization. Yes, Bitcoin can be cheaper fees-wise, but unless you're buying something for thousands of dollars or trying to do micro-transactions, does it really matter much?
Every time I watch bitcoin payment videos I'm like "QR codes? Really? It's 2012 and I have to take a fucking picture of something? That'll go over awesomely while I'm in line at the coffee shop."
I know it's easier to criticize than to create and I'm not trying to disparage the efforts of the community especially at this early stage in the game but until Bitcoin is easy to use it's not going to get a lot of adoption.
I'm also disappointed by the lack of purchasing options currently - sending money to Japan and dealing with AML regulations not only flies in the face of what I consider the spirit of Bitcoin, but probably comes across as weird, difficult, and scammish to the average person.

There's a lot of good stuff in this response. What I'd like to see is a way for people to prove a non-double spend without requiring the entire blockchain. Proving a negative isn't really possible. I wasn't sure if this person had figured out a clever way to put the state in the blockchain. The problem, as you point out, is that there's no guarantee of a non-double-spend. Miners would still have to keep a certain amount of blocks around to check for validity, after which it would be based on trust if only headers were used.


Miners would still need to have the blockchain. The question is, would they need to have ALL of the blockchain?


A DHT makes a lot of sense, unfortunately bitcoin constantly makes new addresses which makes this difficult due to fanout. If there were 1 address per person, and a total balance instead of an coin history tree, then this would be much easier. The entire storage requirement would be 7 billion * (32 bytes + 8 bytes) = 280gb, but distributed. Your double-spend DHT proposal is still a good idea, but fanout makes it constantly grow.
It could work if something like demurage were introduced (this would kill the enthusiasm for bitcoin though) - say every year, you have to send money to yourself to keep it. Old records die off and miners get all the value of "dead" money. This keeps the accessible amount of bitcoins around 21 million and prevents the "lost money" syndrome - it also prevents too much address fanout. It's dangerous though, and it might entice miners to "hold people hostage" since they know that they need to send money to themselves to keep it. Just a random, stupid thought.
Thanks for the good insight.

Just bored at work and felt like doing some math and messing with this problem. It looks like the blockchain could be knocked way down - to 10% or less of its current size.
The current lazy solution is to have a spender prove that their hash is in the merkle tree of a specific block and then walk the headers of all the blocks after that looking at a trim property which indicate which nodes have been trimmed. If you make it to the current block without any part of the path being trimmed, then the transaction is valid, otherwise it's invalid.
Trust would have to be placed in individual nodes and miners at the time of block inclusion that no funny business is going on such that you can be sure if a hash hasn't been trimmed since it was included, then it's valid.

There is no *right* answer. Most people value the ten dollar bill more because it is typically ten times harder to earn and others value it ten times more so it can buy ten times as much as a one dollar bill can. However, if someone likes the picture of Washington better than Hamilton and opts to take the one dollar bill over the ten so they can frame it or something, they're not *wrong*.
Now, I'd find it hard to say that why something is valued has *nothing* to do with the property of the object itself, and that may be a criticism against value being entirely subjective (though I don't think it is), but that certainly doesn't make value intrinsic to the object.

Given an input, a one-way function will fairly easily produce an output, but given an output, it is very difficult to find an input which will produce the output. Due to the output size typically being fixed (SHA256 produces a 32 byte output), multiple inputs can produce the same output ([pigeon hole principle](
Good functions are not only quick to compute and difficult to reverse, but produce output which is evenly distributed over the valid output range so it doesn't leak information about the input and is [collision-resistant](
Here's a dumb example of a one-way function I just came up with.
    Given an input, map it to a telephone keypad
    and replace each digit with English word of the number.
    Then take each letter and map it to the number on
    the corresponding telephone key, then split the results
    into 8 columns (mod 8 index), sum the numbers,
    padding any incomplete rows with zeroes,
    then take the modulus 10 of the sum.
    Then repeat the procedure.
Give input **2018**
    Two Zero One Eight
    896 9376 663 34448
    8 9 6 9 3 7 6 6
    6 6 3 3 4 4 4 8
    -----------------
    4 5 9 2 7 1 0 4
    Four Five Nine Two Seven One Zero Four
    3687 3483 6563 896 73836 663 9376 3687
    3 6 8 7 3 4 8 3
    6 5 6 3 8 9 6 7
    3 8 3 6 6 6 3 9
    3 7 6 3 6 8 7 0
    -----------------
    5 6 3 9 3 7 4 9
Gives **56393749** as output, and will always do so for the input **2018**, but given **56393749**, it's hard to find the input (in theory, this algorithm is almost certainly trash, plus the search space is tiny).

I think governments, just like any other landlord, must provide value to justify its "rent." Some governments probably need to go out of business and be replaced with things which better satsify people's desires. Desert is a term subject to a lot of contention.
As a geoist, I don't believe in taxing labor or capital because that tends to make it more difficult to satisfy desires. However, I recognize that public investments are a positive sum game a lot of the time, and that they often need to be funded by taxes. Taxing economic land (actual parcels, mineral and oil extraction rights, pollution rights (some pollution is necessary for the economy), finishing rights, EM spectrum rights, etc) makes a lot of sense to me because:
1. It can't be moved offshore or hidden
2. It doesn't require a big bureaucratic government to spy on everyone's transactions
3. The wealthiest people tend to have the most natural resource holdings
4. It frees up resources and land for others by making inefficient use costly
5. It leads to more urban compaction which lowers the cost of infrastructure and helps the environment.
6. It approximates benefits recieved since public infrastructure investments tend to raise land values around the area they affect - infrastructure can pay for itself by the amount it raises land values and hence taxes on land values.

I think Ripple and Bitcoin can work really well together. Bitcoin lacks a social credit layer which I think is hurts it in the long run. I've been disappointed lately by what seems like people's willingness to "roll over" for regulation of exchanges. If Bitcoiners are interfacing with the existing banking system and subjecting themselves to all the regulations and taxes that come with it, then why use Bitcoin at all?
Buying things for cash (or bitcoin) in person makes sense. Mailing cash (or sending bitcoin) to strangers is much more difficult. This is why credit cards have chargebacks. Bitcoin has made great inroads in reducing the need for trust, but I posit that it can't eliminate such a need completely. For it to be useful, I believe that there needs to be a trust layer on top of it. The options for such a layer are centralized or decentralized. As with regulation, centralization really drives a stake into the heart of the reasons to bother with Bitcoin in the first place.
Ripple, on the other hand, is doing a bunch of nothing right now because one has to have something to trade in. The benefits of using Ripple to send normal, regulated currencies which are protected by the legal system and chargebacks are too low compared to just using the banking system. Ripple needs a decentralized currency to trade in. That currency should be Bitcoin.
I haven't researched Open Transactions yet, so that could be a replacement for Ripple perhaps.

What's the market cap of PayPal? Ebay is listed as 41billion, I'm sure PayPal is several billion. Bitcoin could be as big as PayPal due to:

2. No company that can take money out of your account for the crappiest of reasons.

One thing that really pisses me off about goldbugs is the use of the term *intrinsic value*.


Mises *Human Action* p96.
What makes something money is that it is others are likely to accept it in payment - not to keep or use for themselves, but to further trade. Things can be both commodities AND money at the same time, and some of the qualities that make something likely to be money may overlap with their usefulness as commodities, but the two aspects are *not* the same. The primary difference is that with money, one primarily gains satisfaction by *getting rid of it*, with other things, one primarily gains satisfaction by *obtaining or using it.*
I say this as one who is holding both bitcoins and silver.
The other bitcoin dis I hear a lot is that it's "fiat currency." Oh, really? Where's the decree? Is it the algorithm used? Bitcoin is *currency by consensus*. To a degree, all currencies are, but with bitcoin it's an existing agreement that one can enter into or not through use of the monetary system without having to worry about those rules suddenly morphing when some new group of people get into power.

That was my understanding, except that change can get sent to a new address that you don't know about. I'm starting to speculate that the "private key" is just a hash that when hashed generates the public key, which would explain why addresses are one-use.
There was a post (somewhere, can't find it) where someone lost a bunch of bitcoins by doing the following.
ADDRESS A: 10000BTC
Send 1 to MtGox at ADDRESS B,
Client generates ADDRESS C for change
* ADDRESS A: 0
* ADDRESS B: 1
* ADDRESS C: 9999
Now, his old wallet file (on the other computer or partition or whatever) knew about A, but not C since C was new and not generated deterministically (as I was mentioning could be done with a seed).
He overwrote the newer version with the older version somehow and lost 9999BTC.
This sort of thing would happen ALL the time using the same wallet on multiple machines (I already got a double spend rejected doing that). The solutions as I can see them are:
1. Have a central location to sync your wallet with.
2. Have a wallet file be able to deterministically create all future addresses from a seed. The seed is effectively your private key.

$1000/day limit, $10,000 per month without having to provide identifying info (my guess is it would include a IRS-friendly number of some type).
My recommendation would be to pull out any BTC you have sitting in MtGox to your local wallet unless you want to play arbitrage. Dump them back in in small quantities to sell when needed. Otherwise, if BTC ends up hitting $100 per, you'll only be able to take out 10 per day.

It's a *weighted* lottery - just like pretty much any endeavor in the world. Go to college to get a degree to get a good job? *Weighted lottery!* Your actually getting a job is luck, but you can increase your chances with a degree.
Since the blocks people are generating have different generation addresses in them as well as a potentially different Merkle root (as different miners might hear about different transactions), the nonce that meets the hash requirement will be different - that part is luck, as is being the first to start, being the first to hear about things, etc. Your luck can be "helped" by working harder.

Only if enough clients reject the blocks such that they don't propagate, otherwise we give deepbit, slush, etc. more power: when I have the whole blockchain, I can verify for myself if it's a double spend and reject any miner block that fails that. Otherwise I have to believe the miners.

I'm curious if we can prime the pump by accepting BitCoins at a loss compared to the local currency rate. This might raise the value of BitCoins over time.

GAH! Stop saying *intrinsic value*! Yes, gold has some uses for ends that people find valuable, that leads people to value gold. While the properties of gold that make it useful for that end is intrinsic to gold, the value isn't. If you still think it is, devise an experiment that I can reproduce to determine the correct value of something by only looking at it. Can't? That's what I thought. Value exists only in the neural connections of people.
Secondly, sure, gold can be used for jewelry and electronics, but those aren't currency uses of gold. With currency, you don't get something you want by using the currency itself, you get something you want by *getting rid* of the currency. So long as you can get someone else who has something you want to take the item, then it will function as currency.
The problem is, there aren't that many people who want gold for actual use. If the currency factor of gold were not weighed in, I'd expect gold to trade for *maybe* $200/oz. Like BitCoins, few people are actually trading gold, most people are speculating that it *will* be currency if the dollar collapses, so its trading price isn't even really due to its use in industry nor to its role as currency, but as a speculative asset.

My problem with the words value, desire, good, bad, right, and wrong is that they have enough definitions to make sentences using them unprecise.
I agree completely that price is not the same as value (nor cost for that matter). I agree that there are certain aspects of an item that make it useful toward certain ends. Water is useful for a myriad of things, food for not starving, etc. However, pretty much everything is useful for something, so that's kind of pointless to talk about.
Your comment about breathable air makes my point for me. Why is air *highly* valuable? Is it more valuable than a shovel? If so, why? If the value of the item is intrinsic, then it cannot be the end that it serves that gives the item value, so it must be a property of the air *considered by itself* that has value. Just as we can determine the luster of gold using only the gold itself, we should be able to determine the value of air in the same way. However, that's not the case.
Air is highly valuable (literally able to be valued) because it serves ends that people highly value (not dying). Thus the value (what one holds important) comes from people. The properties that make something useful for a certain end are intrinsic to the item, but the value is projected onto it later. I think the term intrinsic value confuses things so I've taken it upon myself to stand up against its use.

The problems are computed from a predetermined algorithm.
Basically, the computers are trying to find a number called a noonce such that, when it is added to the block they are trying to create will create a hash below a certain number. This is exponentially difficult to do the lower the number is.
The network recomputes the difficulty every 2016 blocks. The target time of the network is to generate one block per 10 minutes. 168 h/w * 2w * 6b/h = 2016 blocks. The nodes adjust the difficulty proportionately to the amount of time it took to generate the last 2016 blocks. If it only took 1 week, then the difficulty will be doubled. If it took 4 weeks, then the difficulty will be halved.
According to BlockExplorer.com, the difficulty as of this post requires a noonce with produces a has of less than 0x0000000000002694210000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
It is expected to take 1,867,811,188,859,202 attempts on average to find the correct noonce. Even with gigahashes per second, no one would be likely to find that in 600 seconds. However, each person's block is different as it contains a unique generation address to which the 50 reward coins will be assigned, so the same noonce will work for one person where it doesn't for another. While you're still better off having a faster computer, *more* people mining (hence *more* target addresses) still works.
Note that I'm piecing this together from what I've read and I haven't looked at the source code yet.

It depends on what one means by value. If one means utility, then the fact that they can function as currency (e.g. are easily tradable is what gives them value).

1&amp;2. Agreed. Seeing all those change addresses is annoying. While it might be useful for developers, it can be abstracted away from the user. While people can associate names with sending addresses, typing or pasting things in is rediculous. Look at Skype... you have all of your contacts right there.
2 side note: this is why a single address shouldn't be reused unless one isn't concerned about anonymity.
2 (con't) If I were a user I'd be thinking more in terms of transactions, not receiving addresses. So, I'd probably want to say something like "Fred owes me 20BTC for golfing last night" and then it can create a line item for that showing 0 of 20 paid. Underneath, it's creating an address. If I wanted it to, perhaps it could e-mail Fred with an e-mail saying "Hey, Justin says you owe him 20BTC for golfing last night" with the underlying bitcoin address to send payments to. As payments come in 10/20BTC... 15/20 BTC, 20/20BTC eventually the transaction is cleared.
Speaking of transactions, can we have a reliable method to get rid of dead transactions / doublespend. -rescan doesn't work all the time.
3 Yes. In fact the whole totalling thing could be a hell of a lot better.
4 Change that into a new register entry / new expected payment. Allow the user to still see the address so they can pay at their leisure, but focus more on what the payment is for, not the address. In fact, the Description column shouldn't even have a Recieved With BLAH BLAH. It should simply say "Repayment for golfing" +20BTC. I can turn on another column to see the address, or double click it to get more info.
5 Yes! This is quite annoying.
6 A simple pending/confirmed/failed would be sufficient - gray circle, green circle, red circle (or full/empty for you red/green colorblind folks). Once again, if you want details, turn on extra columns, or double click it.
7 Yes, a friendly date display would be better for most. I like my ISO 8601.
8 That's not true, it's by wallet account, not by address. As far as I know, there's no filtering by address. Once again, change it to what it is, not the technical address.
9 Agreed. Why not a delta and balance *like every online banking site in the world?*
10 Kind of. The blocks count is where the client has gotten to thus far. This has been useful to me a few times to tell when things were going to go through when the system wasn't caught up yet. It'd probably be better as a date though "As of May 21,2011", and then it keeps jumping closer to the current datetime.
Ok, now it's my turn to rant, and I have two big ones.
JR1. I know why it has to download the entire block chain, but it's rediculous as more blocks get added. I'd prefer starting with the newest block first and working backwards, but not allowing people to spend the coins (UI-wise) until an appropriate number of blocks backs it. Bonus is that the client can slowly add to the history over time without preventing it from being used right away. If I'm starting out, I'd rather just download the latest 6 blocks to see my coins than have to download 128,000 blocks.
JR2. Can we not have it sound like it's scratching the hell out of my disk when it's running? The blocks are small enough to hold in memory, you don't have to write 1k to the disk every 1/2 second, do it in batches.
JR3. The wallet file. It sucks! First off, I want to have access to it from multiple machines which, I suppose I could set up on a network if the program let me pick a location. That doesn't solve the issue where I have something on my phone and something on my desktop. The issue to overcome is private keys. I think it *could* be solved by creating addresses in a deterministic manner starting from a random seed.
For instance, I have two wallets A and B.
I create a recieving addresses A1, A2, and A3.
When I run B, it's ready to use address A1 because it's the first yielded address given the shared seed. It sees such an address exists in the block chain, so it moves to A2. That exists too, so it moves to A3. These can still fall out of sync if one spends too quickly on different devices. This would also require that blocks are loaded in reverse order (per JR1).
I know it's spammy, but could an encrypted string of the address's purpose be stored in the block chain - otherwise side-band communication would be necessary to keep different wallets in sync.
Basically, take a look at mint.com and make it stupid easy to use.

Well, it's not like Jeff or Gavin are the *bosses of BitCoin*, but it *is* disappointing that Jeff said this though I understand it might just be a PR necessity.
I'm not anti-government, I'm anti-involuntary-government. Yes, society appears to run more smoothly when there are enforced rules (though that doesn't necessarily dictate a centralized ruling structure), but many of the current rules are rules for the sake of rules. Bureaucracies always devolve into working to perpetuate their own existence regardless of the consequences to the end for which they were established.
BitCoin opens the possibility of a more natural, more direct way to interact with others. People can, of course, use that for what many would consider bad purposes. However, I don't see why the government needs to be involved - what value add is achieved through its involvement in BitCoin?

Currently neither statement is true.
1. The rate of bitcoin mining is almost surely outstripping the growth in the bitcoin economy. BitCoin is *designed* to be deflationary eventually. This isn't a horrible thing though because this currency is just getting its legs and it's not formed on a "we need something as money now or we starve" or conquest basis, so it's going to be gradual.
2. Nothing *has* value - people give things value. That's not a criticism of BitCoins any more than it's a criticism of anything else.

Since when does logic and reason work with the government? The only thing they appear to understand is cost. Well, if we want to be a free people - free to trade with one another, then we need to start acting free. It doesn't matter what some dinosaur in Washington says. Act free. When someone tries to stop you, make it so costly that no one will try again. That doesn't necessarily mean violence, though that's an option.
There are plenty of ways to make this decentralized currency actually decentralized. I'm working on a U.S.-based exchange which I will try to rush to market tomorrow that solves the getting money in aspect. It's probably in violation of some rule somewhere. Ultimately it's MY life.
The part that pisses me off the most is the death of possibility. Things are so centralized, and we have ceded so much authority to others that many new possibilities are never even tried or are killed as soon as they are launched. So... do something about it. Live boldly. Build the bitcoin economy up. Set up anonymous exchanges. *Do whatever it takes to live free.*

You're working on your own block because:
1. The transactions you'll have seen may be different depending on how the nodes around you are connected.
2. The address associated with the generated coins will necessarily be different.
These two things lead to a different Merkle Tree hash and hence a nonce that won't work for someone else might work for you (and vice versa).
This is presumably why blockexplorer's [hashestowin]( figure is far higher than any single machine can do in 10 minutes. I assume pools allocate nonce ranges for individuals to work on.

The deflationary aspect coupled with a lack of products backing it up is making it more of a speculative asset than a currency at present. I expect nerds, porn, drugs dealers, and people who can't get credit as well as people who want to get value OUT of certain countries to start backing this with more useful things. Even if it's just exchanges and it becomes a giant Hwalla network it's still worth it.

It is definitely highly speculative right now. If you look at the bitcoin monitor site you can see there are more inter-currency trades than intra-currency purchases. But I also believe it has the power to be a game changer. Porn, drugs, a store of purchasing power to mitigate the damage of a falling dollar, or knocking down the artificial barriers called borders that prevent the exchange of money between willing participants anywhere on the globe - any one of these could make it more widely adopted.
On the other hand, what ultimately keeps people in a currency is the ability to discharge taxes with it - especially property and land taxes since you can't hide from those. The government could target businesses accepting bitcoins (good luck with that) or centralized exchangers (more likely) which would lower the utility of BitCoins at least for speculation. The future is ultimately in direct Bitcoin-for-goods-and-services exchange though, but early government intervention could hobble it. If they were smart, they might try to get in front of it and be the largest mining group to collect sales tax (transaction fees) from everyone.
The people who designed BitCoin aren't perfect and, while all the components of the technology were there, no one has put them together in this way. Moreover, it's easier to see the effects regarding the human component of sharing movies with BitTorrent than it is to see decentralizing the money with BitCoin - though maybe that's hindsight.
So, it could be a game-changer or a fad. Regardless of which it is, I believe that it proves that something like this is *possible* and, if it fails, other smart people will improve on the idea. We haven't seen the last of decentralized digital currency.

One question though, what about exchange rates?

Scarcity allows things potential utility for trade. Currency must have trade utility since currency is a market tool.
While BitCoins are electronic and able to be duplicated without practical limit, each blockchain can create rules on what causes a BitCoin to be considered valid. Think of it more like baseballs autographed by Babe Ruth. Any schmoe can buy a baseball and sign it, but only certain ones are considered authentic. The process of creation for authentic BitCoins can be and, in the case of the BitCoin blockchain, is controlled.
Every so many blocks, the reward for solving a block (which is how new BitCoins are introduced without a central mint) is reduced. This causes the total *authentic* BitCoin supply to asymptotically approach 21 million coins (currently divisible to 8 decimal places).
Around the year 2140 (I believe it is), no new BitCoins will be produced and one can only get them by trading with others. Miners will be able to charge transaction fees, just like they can now, but such fees will play the primary role at that point.

I've done no research on namecoins, I'm going with what I heard. Most likely what I say below will be very misinformed so I apologize in advance.
I would think that a structure something like the following would make sense...
1. Anyone can mine a domain at any difficulty - just come up with a hash and a unique name.
2. A domain is probationary for 2016 blocks (2 weeks) during which time it'll function correctly.
3. If anyone comes up with a nonce which generates a lower hash for a domain, they "win" the domain for 2016 blocks, etc.
4. If no one outbids for 2016 blocks, then the domain becomes solid for 1 year less another probationary period at the end.
5. It would be nice if the SSL cert digest could be stored with the record in the blockchain too
Records could be transferred to others, but the time could not be extended except during the final two week period.
If all we are ending up with is currency to buy domain names, then we haven't come far at all.
The only thing that is questionable (that I can see) with this setup is there doesn't appear to be an incentive to mine blocks.

Again, I'm not involved in the project and I haven't looked the source, so I could be blowing smoke, but I'd expect that you'd need to know which coins are yours. You could look through the block chain, but that would be inefficient.
Your wallet likely starts out with a single 50BTC coin (if you successfully mined), but after that things get tricky. If you bought from MtGox, you may be getting things from more than one seller, or the seller may have given MtGox a 2BTC coin and a 5BTC coin, and you bought 6BTC, so now they have to split and merge those into 6 (or maybe they just give you a 5 and a 1 or something).
A coin itself is just a piece of owned data with a history. There could be no way to combine or split it without announcing or that would lead to people "Charlie Carding" the system and changing the values of their coins.
The issue is ultimately the crummy UI, though I do have another issue with an abundance of addresses and that is the problems they create when running multiple wallets that fall out of sync.

Comparative advantage does exist, but we did end up with that *great sucking sound* that Perot warned about. The problem is that companies and capital are freer to move than people. This will probably be the case even if there are no laws against immigration just because people care about their culture, friends and family while robot welding machines don't.


We already have a huge land tax, it just goes, in part, to private individuals instead of infrastructure improvements and rebates to those excluded.
Public infrastructure in many cases is paid for with an income tax, which discourages productivity. Said infrastructure raises land values around it which increases the rental value or capitalized rental value in the form of land price that owners can charge.
Owners of natural resources break even or even come out ahead depending on how much natural resources they own, while those who own little to none come out behind (though welfare helps that, at the expense of screwing even *more* people over).
[This graph]( shows why any tax up to the actual economic rental value of natural resources cannot be passed on (in addition to the rental value).
Imports would reach an equilibrium eventually, though there can definitely be pain in the overshoot (such as having to retool here in the U.S. now that everything's made in China). However, people *chose* to value crappy cheap products more than expensive items that one doesn't have to replace yearly. It's not my place, your place, or the place of a central planner to dictate what people *should* want.

The issue as I see it is anonymity which may end up being the opposite of trust. I understand that, for now, we need anonymity because the governments of the world suck. If that wasn't the case, I'd prefer a [non-anonymous currency while still keeping it entirely decentralized]( The problem with non-anonymous decentralized currency is how is identity determined and how does one reasonably ensure that each person only has one identity?
While I think this idea would work better with a non-anonymous currency, I think it can work somewhat with BitCoins.

The only taxes that will be easy to collect in a widely-used crypto currency world are economic land taxes (LVT ala Henry George) and taxes on difficult to move/difficult to hide capital.
Taxing capital is dumb though because it disincentivizes production and, while difficult to move capital can't flee, others won't invest in this country so long as the economic climate is more attractive elsewhere.
A tax on economic land causes the least distortions and it works in a crypto-currency world. Want to exclude people from your land with No Tresspassing signs, well then you'd need to have title to that land - public record - problem solved. Same with commercial fishing, mining, etc.
I'm all for a basic income guarantee paid out of natural opportunities that one was excluded from: basically the difference between taxes and governmental cost. An added benefit of this is that money-in-the-pocket tends to motivate people more strongly than abstract ideals. An incentive to keep as much money as possible would incentivize people to demand lowered government spending.
In conclusion, no VAT. The problem with the tax is literally built into it's name. Why should we want to tax the addition of value if we understand that taxing something reduces demand for it. We should have a Value **Subtraction** Tax. Polluting, blocking people from access to the earth they were born on, etc. remove opportunity and undermine the ability for people to satisfy desires.

Because others need to constantly pay taxes (sales taxes, property taxes, quarterly income taxes, capital gains taxes). This creates a more-constant-than-once-a-year need for whatever those taxes must be discharged in. Because others must obtain tax-currency, they demand it in payment. Also, it's a pain in the ass to deal with exchange rates, and the volatility that brings, not to mention it'd explode the beancounters' heads.
Resource-related industries and those that import things typically must trade in national currencies. You don't have to buy an iPod, but you do have to buy oil from other countries.
Unless you're only planning on paying others for goods and services once a year, or are willing to relegate yourself to trading things only amongst your close friends, you need tax-currency.

True, but if enough others are against accepting it, it becomes self-supporting. The blood money would get diluted by clean money as it is passed further from its source, thus the strongest harm would be targeted at the problem person/group and those directly around it. Furthermore, if one isn't willing to suffer somewhat for their values, then they don't really value them. Source-oriented boycotts have the ability to be far more effective than target-oriented boycotts, but they are more prone to disruption by defectors.
If I'm an advertising agency, I have to accept BP's money or another agency will. In the end, the problem still exists, but I just harmed myself. It's the exact same problem as with free riders. If I refuse to accept money from a defector, then they have an incentive to not defect, but I need others to not accept money from me if I defect, etc. Thus, it needs critical mass.


Possibly. I'd expect that it would all be automatic and could in fact be a selling point just like fair trade coffee is now. It's far less of a hassle for web purchases than it is for in-person purchases.


Yes, that will happen, but many small boycotts is just noise and doesn't affect anything. Things that many hold important (e.g. anti-theft/anti-murder) are signal.


Yes, but it wouldn't matter too much for things that few people agree on. It'd make your 1BTC worth 0.9999997 BTC. But there DOES need to be a way to wash BitCoins or else, over time, everything would turn bloody. There can be many different ways to get records released. Once again, nothing is centralized, so the market can figure out what works but there would be growing pains with such a system.

What's up with people assuming inherent value? Yes, certain things are useful for certain, *contextual* ends. That doesn't give them value. People give things value. If things have inherent value, then you should be able to describe for me a scientific test to study an object's *value* property. Can't? Then you're full of shit. End of line.
That said. People *do* value BitCoins for whatever reason. As a currency, all that matters is that you believe that *others* value them widely enough that you can get what you want fairly easily. BitCoins aren't there yet, they're more of an asset, but I don't doubt that they, or something very similar, will become currency within the next few years.
Lastly, Doug, unless you're trading in specie, then you might as well be using dollars. There are no guarantees that people aren't cheating. With BitCoin, *math* is the proof. Math is more trustworthy than humans.

Thank you. I realized after I wrote that that I was making a lot of unfounded claims and bending the definitions of some of the words a bit (though not as much as it would seem - I just made sure I re-read all the definitions of value (n), value (v), and valuable).
The points I was making are largely definitional - primarily that taking the properties of something alone cannot give value as importance, just value as utility (though I think that too requires considering what aspects of something make it useful, and we're back to square one). So the reason why air "has" value is because it is given it by breathers. While this relies on air being effective of respiration, that fact alone is not enough.
In the practically unbounded set of possible states of affairs, something will be effective of one or more of them. The properties that make them effective of those states of affairs can be considered in the scope of what that thing is. Silver is intrinsically conductive of electricity by the nature of that which we call silver. However, that can be said about anything making it useless to talk about; bitcoins almost defintely have some use outside of currency, even if we can't think what that is.
When people say intrinsic value in regards to utility, I believe that they are implying widely-recognized-as-desired uses of something, as well as qualities of something that make it desirable to achieve those ends. For instance, gold is effective of making jewelry that has common human-desirable qualities. Gold itself is valuable as a means to that end not only because it can effect them, but it can do so in a way that doesn't cause other desires to outweigh our desire for gold jewelry. If gold was beautiful, but really hard to work with, it would probably be less valued for making jewelry though gold jewerly would still be valued.
That bitcoin has far less non-currency desired uses is pretty obvious. I felt like I was being pedantic and belaboring the point, but I dislike the term because it leads to annoying questions like "what backs bitcoins?" It's ability to serve as currency and people's desire to/valuing of using currency is what backs it. As a currency, I think it's superior to gold in most ways, but it doesn't have the added non-currency use which causes at least some demand which helps build trust in the currency (though if we're talking non-currency, non-speculation market price for gold, we're talking *maybe* $100-200/oz tops).
Sorry for being a pedantic prick. In part, these posts were an experiment in clarifying my own ideas.

Well, someone *somewhere* will need to pay taxes, which means that they have an impetus to accept it. If you want to do business with them, you have to have some, so you have to accept it, etc. filtering through the whole economy. In order for that to work though, it needs critical mass. Taxes create that critical mass.

Assuming critical mass was there and merchants didn't find it overly problematic, I can see it working in cases where we have a known problem address - as in the case of the current BitCoin heist.
More problematic are the case where someone is sanctioned for, say, vandalism, but no one knows his or her address. I suppose if we actually have custody of the person, then other sanctions could be involved. Coupling BitCoin with something like RipplePay could be effective here too.
Regardless, I'm very interested in figuring out ways for people to solve their own problems and make being a hawk amongst doves too costly to practice.

That is a shortcoming of my proposal. I didn't mention that the limitation on single-use is only for signing blocks, not for transferring funds generally, so the user could transfer funds to a new account and try again (though they'd sacrifice coin age). I would expect that this
No system is as convergent as proof-of-work, but I'm interested if other system can be good enough when weighed with the advantages of something like proof-of-stake, namely that the cost of an attack is significantly higher and, less important, the network consumes less electricity. An advantage of this specific proposal is that multiple people can sign blocks, adding consensus weight, making it more of a cooperative endeavor.

Ok, here are two things I've been wanting to clear up.
1. Addresses appear to be able to receive multiple payments. What's happening in the background? Do I end up with a 5BTC "coin" and a 10BTC "coin" at a single address? If not, how does the network correctly increment the balance in the address?
2. Are addresses one-use only? When I spend from an address, I'd have to use the public key which, unless the hash was also against some other one-use UID, would render the address compromised. If there are address coins they would all have to be sent to a new address. If this is the case, what if I am at a lower block than everyone else and I spend the coins in an address while there is still a payment to that address outstanding. Can others, now knowing the public key for that address, spend my other coin before I know about it, does the system invalidate further spends making those coins lost? If so, that's a crappy weakness.
@_date: 2011-06-01 18:31:45
My ignorant understanding is that your wallet contains a bunch of coins of arbitrary size over time. Your total might say 15.38BTC, but that total could be comprised of a 2.3BTC coin, a 7.18BTC coin, and a 5.9BTC coin.
If you want to spend 1.5BTC, one of those coins needs to be split, but that split has to be publicly announced for distributed transactional integrity. Rather than using an existing recieving address for change, they create a new one which also helps obsfuscate things since one can't tell which address is change and which address belongs to the payee. They probably could've just used a single change receiving address, but addresses are so cheap to create, it's worth the extra anonymity.
However, the client really does suck in the UI department. Do I need to see all these addresses unless I'm taking a detailed look at my wallet? No.

Possibly, I don't know enough about how it actual works and I'm too busy/lazy to read the source code. I'm kind of piecing things together from what I heard/read on forums, so I'm probably way off. I *think* that what are considered coins are an address and a value, so individual coins could hypothetically be signed away to a different address without making the entire previous address unusable.
Regardless, the user shouldn't have to worry about that sort of thing. If we're going to have wallet files, they should be like a bank book.

There is never actual consensus in any distributed cryptocurrency, including those using proof of work, there's just various probabilities of convergence over time. The most convergent systems have a proof or information which is OUTSIDE of the blockchain and which applies to or prevents working on multiple chains. There's always the hypothetical that someone could come along with a superminer and fork the chain and everyone who was honest would have to watch their transactions get rolled back.
Proof of work is currently the king of convergent "proof of X" systems because the probabilistic proof of work exists outside of the blockchain and effort spent on one chain prevents effort spent on another.
I've been poking around with an idea which can leak information outside of a chain which would (hopefully) cause people to not try to work on multiple chains. It's based on the idea of commitments and ECDSA private key leaks to create single use minting addresses; if someone tries to double-mint, every observer can get the private key and "steal" the funds from the account.
Note that knowledge of the private key is not chain-specific, it can exist outside of any chain - which is closer to a convergent system than is a system which "depends on the very history it is trying to form to enforce loss of value."
Such a system probably would have distribution issues, and premine is the mark of a shitcoin, so I'd recommend bootstrapping it from Bitcoin or another established crypto currency.

Something like TITAN. Snowden publishes a "base public key." People send to a "biased address" and encrypt the bias of this address relative to the public key.
Snowden scans all transactions, sees he can decrypt a bias, multiplies his base address by the bias, sees this is the target address he now knows the private key which is the private key of his base public key times the bias. 
The only issue is stuffing enough info into the script for this to work or one could use a bunch of outputs but I hate that because it clutters the UTXO list.

The problem is that no one can know what the correct supply of money is because velocity is also a factor. I personally favor a population-pegged currency where for every person there is, say, 10,000 currency units. This is because I see people as wealth creators, so at least the additional currency is likely to be backed by something.
That is not possible with a decentralized currency (or at least a currency where people can have more than one identity).

I agree 100%.
I would love to see Ripple on Bitcoin because it is truer to the purpose of money as a widely recognized IOU and it allows trust and self-policing. I *want* new identities to be expensive so that people will be less likely to do *bad things* and damage their reputation.
Deterministic wallets are totally the right way to go - I don't see why the client wasn't released with it by default. I ran into issues running the same wallet on multiple machines (got my first double-spend attempt). Such problems would be far less likely with deterministic wallets. Furthermore, it can allow thin clients by keeping most of the information necessary to rebuild itself *in the blockchain*.
I think we need to move beyond the traditional financial system though we shouldn't toss everything out. If all BitCoin becomes is PayPal 2 then we haven't come very far.

Fungibility CAN'T be built in because it's something that humans assign. If two people enter a racist barber shop and one is black and one is white and both have what others would consider interchangeable 1oz gold coins, the barber can make the one held by the black guy worthless (at his shop) by rejecting it.
Now, you could argue that he's not rejecting the coin itself. However, if he could trace the history of the coin, he could assign taint to the coin. Being against non-fungibility is one thing. Being against a transparent and open society is something else entirely. Freedom of association within a transparent society may eliminate fungibility and, if I had to pick only one world of the two to live in, I'd choose the former.

With printing more money the individual or group which controls the new money has an increase relative to everyone else (unless they distribute it perfectly proportionately to all money-holders).
With making it more divisible, the relative amount of money between individuals as a proportion is maintained.
That is, if I have 10 bitcoins and you have 100 bitcoins, you have 10x more money than me. If I have 10,000mBTC and you have 100,000mBTC, you still have 10x more money than me.

However, most of what the government does is not necessary and doesn't adhere to any kind of social contract - the government breaks its own rules all the time or comes up with a stretched justification.
I also don't think paying taxes makes one a better person if a lot of those taxes are funding things which actively harm others. I already pay property tax which funds 95%+ of the things I make use of in the day-to-day and which don't harm others.
I believe in working within the system and working around the system concurrently. Bitcoin allows that. People should make their own judgements. Imploring others to not take an agorist approach because it hurts some bitcoin portfolio (as was done in the other post) is just infuriating to me though.
Bitcoin is a tool. Tools &lt; ends. If the price of bitcoin had to go to zero for humans to realize more of their goals, I'd cheer its destruction. As it stands, it's one of the most important inventions in recent history to coordinate voluntary action and it has the potential to be one of the most disruptive this century.

Their ability to tax barter is limited. Few barter anyways, so it's not a big deal. They'd probably lose money tracking down bartering evasion.
If bitcoin tax evasion ever became widespread, they'd have a few options:
1. Try to ban BTC. Good luck, though the DefCad thing was pretty hubristic of them.
2. Try to coopt BTC by making AmeriCoin. Probably not going that route.
3. Spend a lot of time and effort cracking down on evaders, probably making a big show of the few they capture to strike fear into others and make them think the chances of their getting caught are higher than they actually are.
4. Put up with it
5. Put up with it and shift taxes to things which are harder to avoid like real property.

Bitcoin can force a move toward that world (or away from it).
1. Move taxes off of trade and onto exclusive control of resources.
2. Pay dividends (basic income guarantee) from these taxes
3. Allow people to boycott the money of "bad people"
In such a world, what's the problem with technological unemployment? How can people screw others?
They control all the robots? Make your own. Either you can't because I.P. (which would need to go) or because you don't know how (get enough people together and that problem goes away) or because land and resources are monopolized (not if they're taxed and you're getting a payout from those holding more than "their fair share.")
1. Rapid increase in wealth inequality

So long as those people are in the minority, there's not much of a problem. Of course, this could backfire with people getting killed just because their rich or famous or someone once heard they molested someone or something.
The key difference I see is that investing bitcoin to kill someone has both a higher psychological cost and currency cost than voting.
Voting does substantially the same thing as an assassination market. Oh, the gun isn't as obvious, but people are voting to say "I want you to make laws which force others to do or be what I like, but I'm too ignorant to realize what that actually entails or I'm too much of a pussy to actually go pistol whip what I want out of others myself."
Less people will use an assassination market than vote because voting is revered and is considered equal with liberty even though the concepts are completely unrelated to one another. Less people will use an assassination market than vote because hating someone enough to have them killed costs more money than you can make in the 20 minutes it takes to stand in line and fill out an oval with a  pencil.

The classic problem with digital currencies is that someone can spend money with someone else, then duplicate the bits and spend it with you. One of you two will get screwed later after the guy is long gone.
Centralized digital currencies solve this by having each person check the validity of the money with a centralized issuer who keeps track of who's spending what.
**The thing** which Bitcoin did differently - and this is what really makes it special - is that it eliminated the central authority and just has the first transaction to make it through become the winner. If someone tries to spend the same coin again, it can't make it into the same block (that block won't be valid) and later blocks will reject it because they'll see it was spent in earlier blocks.
Mining is a process to determine the *canonical* order in which transactions happen. Whether or not it's the actual order of a double-spend doesn't matter.
Mining is also a way to introduce money into the system since, without a central issuer, who would be in charge of issuing money and how would they do it fairly?

Being rich if people voluntarily exchange money to you for something that your providing them and you are in no way making their lives worse off to drive such exchanges to you is not a privilege in my estimation.
Both public and private institutions don't necessarily seek to actively screw people over, but generally will if given the chance. I'd assert that most if not all rich people have some aspect of privilege in their portfolio. I could make the same claim about middle class and poor people too, but the general percentage of wealth obtained by privilege or outright theft will be smaller.
I've never been a fan of taxing people more just because they have more even though marginal utility is a real thing. I'd prefer to eliminate privilege where possible and tax the gains away where privilege is necessary. Under such a system there'd still be millionaires but almost definitely no billionaires.
As far as feelings, yes people have them and will necessarily make use of them. People with severely diminished emotions tend to be highly ineffectual even if they have are robust rationalists. But emotions can't be a substitute for rationality. Emotions are important for figuring out what you want and what you don't want. Rationality is critical for figuring out the means. My limited interaction with OWS indicated to me that many were more interested in how solutions made them feel rather than if those solutions would achieve their proclaimed goals. (That probably means that their actual goals were feeling good and venting.)
When OWS was about WALL STREET and crony capitalism, the message was focused. It got diluted by a lot of others who saw it as a vehicle to promote their own goals and it became a progressive pig pile. I'm not against most of the goals that people who identify with OWS profess: more wealth equality, more opportunities for young people (hell, for everyone), marriage equality, etc. The only three issues I think the OWS crowd leaned towards which I'd disagree with are *more government - especially more centralized government* and *tax the rich just because they are rich - and any kind of wage tax* and *free X* where X = healthcare, education, etc.
The movement tried to become a jack of all trades and became a master of none. I'm hopeful that the connections made and lessons learned during it will continue into a longer-term movement.

If I had won that $600m jackpot, I would've tried to start a charter city outside of the U.S. with bitcoin as the currency. 
Anything which increases transparency and deliberation and *localism* is welcome by me. Still a meta-system where people (and towns) are under competition for land and citizens in a much more direct manner would allow best systems to emerge in a free-maket-type way (at least hypothetically).
So, continue to hash out your idea. It will probably solve or reduce several big problems in the current system while introducing more. I can't offer anything else right now typing in an iPhone.

Using bitcoin IS changing the system. What would happen if enough people use bitcoin? The IRS either has to crack down hard and people either need to grow balls or stop saying "land of the free" in that stupid song. If the former, the government has to switch to property / land taxes which are much more bound by the value of living there (aka services rendered) rather than "you make more therefore you owe more."

As far as I'm concerned, there are currently three good ways to buy bitcoins with good being defined as:
* Quick
* Relatively hassle-free
* Doesn't cost more than 1% or 2% over spot
* Invisible to the government (no SSN, name, DOB, etc.)
The first is to mine bitcoins. The second is to know someone who is selling them and who you interact with on a regular basis such that he or she can front you the coins. The third is a cash deposit at a bank.
Meeting strangers sucks because arranging times to meet suck. The only exception to that which I would consider would be in the context of local bitcoin meetups.
The most easily scaleable system that a company could actually turn a profit from is the third one. Yet every one of them [stupidly uses their own bank account]( instead of just connecting you to other people's accounts and then either calling the bank to settle disputes or doing something like NashX.

You need a majority to love you or fear you. Maybe I'm coming at it from too libertarian a perspective, but I doubt that too many people pay their taxes out of love for what the government does with it, though some would pay it even if it was voluntary. The IRS is able to make examples out of enough people that the majority fall in line.
That's not killing a single person, and doesn't contradict your claim, but making an example out of someone and letting it be known that you can can cause the system to change.
I'm not promoting or disparaging Jim Bell's idea or any specific implementation of it, but let's say that either a lot of people are a little fed up or a few people are a lot fed up with the level of their discuss measured in bitcoin donations to a target list.
Here's a hypothetical "internet warrior" story...
Now, let's say that a few high profile people get killed. What happens? The screws tighten, and people flip out. Bitcoin might even be blamed. But let's further suppose the government can't
1. Ban guns / ammo and
2. Ban the internet
Because either of those two would cause enough Americans to get off their ass to do something. You can ban centralized Bitcoin exchanges (operating in the U.S.), but Localbitcoin is not affected. It also doesn't stop people who already have Bitcoin from donating.
A few more people die, specifically the ones who are targeting bitcoin. After one of the previous assassins got caught, new assassins got smarter. Someone rigged a zipgun to a model drone and capped someone coming out of his house. A few others found unique uses for all that unaccounted for 1080 and tannerite. After that, assassinations became far less risky to the perpetrator and people discovered it was psychologically easier to press a button than to hide in someone's bushes until they went to get in their car. Sanitized warfare had become a double-edged sword.
Still, the screws tighten because the people in power still love power.
Soon the assassinations switch from "head of DHS/DEA/ATF/IRS" to "any person going to work in one of those buildings." These people are just "doing their job" and aren't in it for the power so much as the paycheck. Rumors spread around the water coolers and coffee machines. The spouses of these employees aren't used to D.C. life - they're just regular folks who want to see their significant others make it home to raise their children. The government can't afford the manpower or money to protect all of these people and the hits keep on coming.
If it hadn't happened earlier, a message comes out aggregating the information in the "donation reason" fields. The general gist is "stop fucking with us and we'll stop fucking with you." The risk bonuses are not enough to keep people working at certain agencies and the brain drain begins. The leaders had continued doing the wrong thing until they could no longer afford it, their choice now was to look weak by capitulating to the demands of an anonymous subset of individuals who had voted with their dollars or try to squash it. But people were getting fed up for a while and the increasing wealth gap and diminishing real opportunities fueled the anger. Most didn't support assassination politics, but most didn't really care when a politicians got hit. The blue-color bureaucrats were more sympathetic characters, but there were numerous people who had been fucked over by the system or had friends and relatives who had and who were seething in silence.
The more the strength of the government was put into question, the less obeyed its edicts against making contributions to such systems or using digital currencies in general. The system was becoming unstable as it walked away from the long-running attractor of state monopoly on legitimate power. Things were moving to chaos... or a new normal.
The decision, ultimately, was up to the old guard to make. Enough people who were sick of the status quo were willing and able to use technology to bring power to bear against the old guard that the old guard *had* to respond. The only question was, how would they respond?

Most people are good but people are only as good as they can afford to be. I don't have a problem with institutions where I can verify the information. The government says it dumped Bin Laden's body at sea. Let's see some proof. 
A charter city with from-sky surveillance to which everyone has access greatly reduces the power disparities due to only one side having information. I can, in such a system, follow the assertions of observation institution X but I can largely verify what they're asserting.
Even with transparency a need for trust cannot be entirely eliminated if one is using society as a tool to get what one wants. My default position is one of trust in situations where people would be likely to have an aversion toward being a jerk (for instance, in face-to-face dealings).

So I'm on your side here, but offering an olive branch to the people who support taxes.

That's blatantly false as stated. Some guy is about to rape someone. Cop or civilian or the woman shoots him. Problem solved.
However, it rarely the case that political systems change due to killing a few people since the problems are systemic.

Killing individual people can be part of that.

My problem is that I can't "homestead" a name that no one else wants without competing with everyone else who also wants a name (outside of a mining pool anyways). Mining makes sense for currency where doublespends are a problem. For domain names it's not really necessary. I can almost guarantee that no one else wants justopia.bit (at least until they read this). Why can't I just "mine my own business" on my own machine and not in competition with others (unless they want that same name) and then submit my proof of work to the network?


No. The system would allow one signed payload per address. If you want to change what addresses a name points to, use that name to sign a new payload. The payload should be able to contain a date or version number to indicate that it's newer. If one wants to sell the domain name, then they need to give up the address and private key to another. The only downside there compared to namecoin is that they could always be sneaky and keep a copy of the private key. This is a not insignificant problem.


Yes. It would be its own datastore. There'd be no blockchain, just a hashtable of address, payload pairs and probably a prefixes index. If a signed message comes in, a record is either created or overwritten. If a prefix search is done, then the hardest address with that prefix would win and then the lookup would occur using that address. Unlike the bitcoin blockchain, it's assumed that people need the entire DNS table because a holey DNS table sucks at being useful. Spam may be an additional problem here, but it'd only be of junk names. There may be ways around this, but I'll have to do more thinking on it.

It's marking a coin based on its history. Think of it like Nazi gold or blood diamonds. Since the blockchain is public, people can follow the history of all coins and thus the taintedness can follow them.
Obvious problems are that removing fungibility may weaken bitcoin and that people could receive coins for a legitimate trade that are later marked bad due to their history before you received them.

While I would prefer a purely voluntary society, I recognize that that's not really desirable for a majority of people without some significant changes which might allow anarchy to be more stable and egalitarian.
I'm not so idealistic as to let it get in the way of a practical functioning society. Unfortunately, I have big problems with the state as a denier (or limiter) of goal actualization. There are some goals which I think making harder is a good thing - murder, for instance - but the system has grown far beyond the bounds of what I would consider a *necessary evil*, it's mostly an *unnecessary evil*.
Bitcoin hypothetically allows avoidance of the taxes which are primarily used to fund bullshit as opposed to the public goods which I feel could reasonably be argued for (roads, etc.). Property taxes and gasoline taxes pay for the roads, police, etc. in most areas and they are local taxes which are *probably* better - it's not like local government is necessarily less corrupt, it's that it's easier to catch and oust a local government than it is a more national government.
Property taxes and gasoline taxes can't be avoided by using bitcoin. On the other hand, sales and income taxes can and these are the primary individual taxes at the state and federal levels respectively. Aside from a *few* programs which I think a case could be made for, they fund a lot of bullshit - the NSA thing just being the most recent example to make the news.

I don't see anarchism working without two things:
* An incentive and means to bargain instead of fight - this is one of the reasons I support geoism. 
* A nearly transparent society so people can't have false reputations. 
These map roughly to an ability for people to e the police: detection and enforcement. 
If people aren't willing to do some of the dirty work themselves and pay direct costs, then someone will step in and it's likely the situation will turn "stateful" again.

The taxes which bitcoin enables evasion of are the ones typically used to fund the "bad side" of the package deal.

How about I deposit some cash and you give me some bitcoins end of transaction?

How is ownership determined here? If it's by external human metrics, then Bitcoin proves that you can't eliminate trust. If it's by the chain of control then theft isn't possible within the system. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:27:43
How is ownership determined here? You can't point to the system for ownership and then deny it later. If I own coins because someone transferred them to me within the system, then this action wasn't theft. If ownership is transferred outside the system by some human standard, then it can be theft.

I'll still pay my unavoidable (and not self-actualization-denying) land taxes (the taxes on the house are bullshit though but I can't avoid them), and those don't go to fund much evil or waste.

The only altcoin that sounds interesting to me is ppcoin. I'd add zerocoin to that list too, but I'd prefer that anonymizing functionality was rolled in to bitcoin.
The use of Scrypt over SHA256 sounds like a good idea at first because, if specialized hardware can't mine litecoin, then it'll be more resistant to a few miners controlling the network. However, I heard an announcement that there are/will soon be asics that can do that.
This leads me to retain my suspicion that litecoin is promoted primarily by GPU miners who are butthurt that asics have made their machines no longer profitable.
@_date: 2013-08-14 16:42:54
If that's the case, it's mostly the fault of the clients. I was transferring funds from cold storage to my web wallet, and ended up sending all of it over and then returning the difference so the client wouldn't come up with a new change address that I'd have to also back up.

Here's the problem with that outlook though - and it's one which people use to elevate voting at the ballot box over voting with one's dollars even though the latter is far more nuanced and accurate and could be considered just.
If the rich gain their wealth through their own effort or by doing/being something useful to another, then I see no problem there - others have *ceded* their voting power to those people. (As an aside, there's an "recent" idea to do this with traditional voting too where it can be a hybrid of direct and representative democracy where each individual can have people vote for them or do it themselves on different issues. This is effectively the *exact* same thing as voting with your dollars so long as they were earned.)
Here are the immediate problems I can see with voting with dollars:
* Sometimes people have more because they stole it
* The cycle of poverty
I include all but the most necessary forms of self-actualization denial to be theft. These include non-compensatory enclosure of the commons, a large percentage of the current legal regulation, patents, most forms of taxes, fraud, direct theft, externalities such as dumping pollutants, etc. Addressing this really requires people to be more vigilant. It's, in effect, vote fraud but it's probably harder to catch. An honest currency (bitcoin) is a good start. A more transparent society is almost certainly another requirement. The biggest is that people give a damn. If they don't then they get big governments and big wealth disparities.
The second is why I'm a fan of a basic income guarantee / dividend - which is a strange thing for a libertarian-leaning person to say. For me, liberty is a means not an end. It's cheaper to have a stable society and for me to get what I want if people aren't fighting and the wealth disparities aren't *too* great. But how to fund the B.I.G. is another issue. I prefer a land/resource value tax because exclusive ownership of gifts of nature is one of the primary reasons people are poor *against their will.* (If people *want* to be poor, then fuck em - they get less "votes".)

What I'm saying is there's not one standard. With bearer bonds, the payer is expressing a normative belief that the possessor is deserving of money in exchange for the bond - aka they *normatively* own it. If the payer *didn't* believe that (at least most of the time), then why would they pay?
The conception of ownership and theft (and all other conceptions) are clusters of patterns which are matched by certain states of affairs. I'm not arguing that sweeping coins isn't douchey or it shouldn't be punished (where it can be detected), but that it doesn't appear to hit all of the aspects I'm aware of in the conception cluster of "theft." Thus I'm less confident that it actually IS theft.
I used this on a philosophy discussion to point out the problem with rule utilitarianism where the rules aren't desires. If the wrongness of something is because it's theft, then it might not be wrong if it's not clearly theft. If the wrongness of something is due to people not liking it (which underneath, it really is) then whether it's theft or not doesn't have to matter.
Here are a few more weirdnesses:
1. I know the combination to your safe. I don't open it but change the combination and walk away. Have I stolen what was inside of it? In the denial of opportunity of use sense, yes. In other senses, maybe?
2. Unless you mined the coins yourself, the previous puzzle-knower agreed to make the new condition a puzzle you know in exchange for whatever you gave him or her. They didn't necessarily agree that the new puzzle would ONLY be known to you.

I'm not arguing whether or not anarchy is desirable relative to certain ends; I'm asking whether or not it's possible or sustainable and what the conditions are which are required.
Circumscription Theory indicates that better organized groups screwed others off of beneficial land such that their new best option was to join that group. Most forms of anarchy are practically as a matter of course less organized than a "for god and country" indoctrinated fighting force.
Then there's the issue of the U.S., which as much as people want to bitch, had people in the past which more or less voluntarily chose a state. The fact of the matter is that most people don't care about freedom in the abstract more than they care about safety, purity/unity, authority, feeling part of the winning team. While a lot of the specifics are due to false beliefs, a not insignificant amount is due to valuing different things which may be incompatible with anarchy as many here want it.
These are examples of how anarchistic societies can be conquered from without or within. Then there's the matter of establishing a state-free existence in the presence of states. If people are whinging about Adam Kokesh and his march on D.C. then there's little hope for people in this country. Someone, *somewhere* is going to have to *do something* to get statists to leave them alone. The regular people don't really care *that* much about people doing their own thing, but those in power can stop people leaving the tax farm by turning the opinions of the regular people against defectors: they're terrorists, they aren't paying their fair share, etc. Either you need to turn the people against the government or make the goverment and the people feel pain if they cross you. 
Some anarchists are trying the former but it's largely a waste of time in my opinion. The government will have better PR for the foreseeable future and people are so indoctrinated by love of country that they'll blindly accept bullshit. Even if you get past that, a lot of people frankly want safety and purity more than freedom (in the abstract).
Any given state will crash and burn at some point, but there is a tendency for states to rise from the ashes as charlatans promise people who are scared and emotionally vulnerable safety by ceding power and authority to them. Even if no new state arises, other states exist and might like the land or resources the disorganized society is sitting on.
If people truly value freedom over other things, then why the hell are thy paying income taxes. Don't dare say "because force." Mandrik is selling baklava without taxes. All you have to do is give up certain consumerist trappings such as owning a home or new vehicles. If you don't do that but have the opportunities then you're saying that comfort is more important than showing that one can live state free in the presence of a state.
For the record I didn't pay taxes for a couple of years and now do because
I'm married and have a house. What I'm not doing is pretending that anyone other than me is making that choice. Yes, I didn't create the bullshit situation, but I can sure as hell make choices within it.
Ultimately if anarchy isn't possible then we can all stop talking about it as anything other than an ideal. Action towards achievable ends does more to liberate people than mental masturbation. If anarchy isn't sustainable due to countervailing forces then there'd be new cops to arrest the new Adams. They might call themselves DROs or whatever, but they'll be part of the new state. 
Lest I come off as too negative, I *do* believe that anarchy *may* be possible with the technology which exists currently, but it cannot be purely an-cap or work like a current first world country minus an overarching government. Maybe I'm wrong about that. Maybe I'm wrong about it not being possible using the current social form, but every person who doesn't do something about it NOW shows, through their actions, that they don't believe it's possible either - they're just too pussy to admit it. 
Like it or not, [this guy is 100% correct]( in my opinion. I'm not saying violence is good or that one has to be an aggressor, but someone, somewhere, has to do something whether that's arresting judges and cops and politicians and bureaucrats or flat out shooting them if they resist or are unarrestable.

I was going to buy more when it broke the June 2011 all time high, but MtGox was a pain in the ass without Dwolla and I wasn't going to tell them my life story just to be able to buy coins. Coinbase was overly restrictive with the amounts one could purchase, though I did make a few purchases through them. I didn't yet know about BitFloor.

I'm not pro-tax, but the cost/benefit for basic public goods at this point indicates paying taxes is a net gain in general. That said, the type, amount, and destination for those taxes matter quite a bit.
I already pay for 95%+ of the infrastructure I use through property taxes and gasoline taxes. The money stays mostly local and while local governments may be just as corrupt as the federal goverment, I have a lot more control over them and the money goes through fewer hands. 
Why am I paying for at the federal level? SS which I'll never see? Medicare and Medicaid? Goverment pensions? The drug war? Drones? Blowing up brown people? No thanks.
Also, I absolutely despise any sort of wage or national sales tax. Trade an wealth creation should be encouraged, not inhibited. There are plenty of bads or neutrals to tax without resorting to taxing goods. 
An IRS commissioner once said that "we are answering these arguments [tax resister arguments] with judicial action." Well, we bitcoiners are answering the corruption, waste of tax dollars, and taxation with effectively no representation through the use of bitcoins. 
If the government cannot stop bitcoin, it will have to adapt to a new normal. Change doesn't happen because the government or the masses of people behind it suddenly see the light. It changes because the old people who were resistant to change die off or a new circumstance foists direct and noticeable costs on the government or people. Since baby boomers haven't died off yet, technology is the best bet for rapid social change at this point.

Laws are just words on paper. They only have effects because people believe in them or believe that others believe in them. Few obey speed limits if they're considered too slow for the road and condition.
There is a cost to enforce and respect laws. With bitcoin the costs of enforcement are high and the benefits to ignoring laws against bitcoin are probably decent. At some point, though, I'd like to see people stand up and say "no" a bit more loudly than they have been recently in first world countries.

Assuming a post-employment self-sustaining "socialist" storage facility, I could still see uses for currency:
1. Scarce robot time. Rather than travel, there'd be X number of robots in France, Y in the U.S., etc. At any given time you could inhabit one of them so long as there was no conflict. But, since they'd be scarce compared to compute cycles, there'd need to be a way to resolve that conflict.
2. Compute time. Need more compute power to run more complex virtual worlds? If synching with the real world, obtain at least 1 second per second.
3. Getting people to do for you. Sure, no one would need to cook or build cars or those kinds of things, but they could still design things, provide companionship, create worlds to visit, write songs, etc.

Norms are just a specific class of meme. They exist in a "memeplex." The best metaphor I have for memes and norms is that of GIT branching and merging.
The state is given power by enough people that you find useful or fear. If not, you act against those people's goals and that's fine too, it just means that there are multiple normative contexts operating concurrently.
However, the same thing could be said about certain forms of private land ownership being legitimate, such as homesteading. Different people will have different opinions and both can be right *from within their own context*.
@_date: 2013-09-30 17:46:58
Theft is taking something owned by another. I would consider taking your coins theft, but are they YOUR coins? How is ownership determined in the bitcoin system? The bitcoin system has no concept of normativity because it's a computer. Humans must graft that on afterwards, but that means they're not trusting the bitcoin system completely as the ultimate "decider."
That's fine, but it makes me wonder why people have so much of a problem with tainted coins and other bitcoin "add-ons."
Also, even though I deny any non-peer-to-peer social contract, there is an established concept of acquiescence is acceptance. People use bitcoin because they reject the state (or they think it's cool/useful, or they're get-rich-quickers). It's not like how bitcoin works is a big secret. If people want security, they should use banks or paypal.
Again, that doesn't mean that people can't treat coin sweeping the same as theft would be treated, I just don't think it technically qualifies as theft - at least not as clear cut as other things which people claim are theft.

I'm inclined to agree, though decentralized exchanges can still exist online outside of unfriendly jurisdictions (the site, not the actually mechanism of exchange).

More like this...
A group of kids decide they want to build a slide and any new kids will also help. Over time, other groups of kids take over all areas on the planet so one will always be a new kid somewhere.
To decide how to maintain the slide, the kids elect leaders. Over time, the leaders find ways to exploit human psychological weaknesses and start doing things which weren't in the originally agreed-upon mandates. Since there is a benefit from using the slide and associating with the kids in the group, and moving elsewhere will be more of the same, most kids stay and hope, against evidence, that voting the right individual in will change things. This gives the appearance of a mandate to those in charge and those which support the leader's policies.
Over time, only a small fraction of maintenance fees are being used to maintain the slide while a lot is used to go beat up other kids and take their lunches or add a bunch of extra regulations to sports or demand that the kids who are stronger physically or mentally give some of that up for the other kids.
If anyone questions the arrangement they are given the choice of moving, trying to be elected as a leader, or shutting up. The kids will point out that the individual is getting the benefit of the slide and, even if they only pay for the maintenance of the slide, they are stealing from others who are forced (by their own sense of duty) to pay for non-slide activities.
Along comes a technology which can allow individuals to free ride more easily. The kids could find other ways to raise money for the slide, such as fencing the area around the slide off and ensuring anyone who is admitted is on the paid-up list. The leaders won't easily be able to do non-slide-related things and people will (hopefully) stop revering and fearing the current system.
And then someone bitches about that new technology being attacked by the current leaders and ruining how much potential access to the slide they can buy with it.

In principle, treating currency as the confluence of truth, trust, and trade and refusing to trade in Nazi gold or blood diamonds or tainted bitcoin is not a problem. In practice it is. Furthermore, without well-known addresses, it's pretty much impossible to implement well.
The flip side of tainted coins are colored coins (which also break fungibility, but no one seems to care). In both cases, individuals decide that a coin is worth more or less than any other coin. If you believe in freedom of association and acting on information you can obtain, then calm yourself.
What I consider good reasons to be against tainted coins:
1. It can't be done well without well-known / registered addresses
2. Without a state or something similar demanding payment of taxes in bitcoin, which causes the usefulness of bitcoin to outweigh people's fungibility concerns, people will switch to another currency in which they can hide their "sins." Taint harms bitcoin in the absence of [such a system](
What I consider bad reasons to be against tainted coins:
1. Mah portfolio!
2. Currency must be fungible! No, sorry, fraud and theft don't *have* to be things people just accept. That's what technology is for (politics is a shit way of dealing with social problems). It used to be that centralization and physical exchange were necessities before bitcoin - people decided they could do better. If there was a [dollar bill that would turn black as soon as it was stolen]( the world would probably be a better place. The trick is to have it turn black before some innocent person recieves it. If you're against such a system then you're probably an asshole who just wants to protect the portfolio (see 
3. It makes things confusing. That's what technological improvements are for.

This is pretty much what I suggest, and I *really* hope bitcoin forces the state to either disappear entirely or at least switch to LVT. LVT is compatible with libertarianism in my opinion and it can be applied in anarchist, panarchist, statist, or other societies. I, too, would prefer that it's not done by a state.
Mason Gaffney estimated economic rent in the U.S. to be about 5.3 trillion. Given that taxes come out of rent, I'd expect that number to be even higher if income and capital gains and corporate taxes were ended. Excluding children, that's over $20,000 a year per person, and then local taxes can come out of the dividend. One sure way to prevent people from supporting wars and nanny-statisms is to have them pay in a very visible way for it. If the government could no longer borrow or print due to bitcoin, so much the better.
If you need to expend a lot of resources to establish or run a DRO, you're probably an anarchist who doesn't realize he's a state. Giving others a direct reason to respect your exclusive claims over parts of the earth is a decent way to get stable anarchy.

But it wouldn't be denial of self-ownership if external opportunities are not prerequisites of self-ownership. The problem with self-ownership is it both refers to the descriptive and the normative.
Normatively, it's possible to have self-ownership without access to nature (though it might not pass the ought implies can). Descriptively, it's not possible at least in a continuous manner. As soon as one took a breath, he'd be taking something external to himself and making it part of himself. Also he'd at each instant be occupying three dimensional space.
How about if I build a cell around someone while they slept, say a homeless person who didn't have permission to be sleeping there in the first place. I wouldn't have aggressed on their actual body, but I'd still be denying them opportunities. I know it's an edge case, but I like exploring the extremes sometimes.

Please note that I'm not supporting CoinValidation, but I want to clarify something:


That presumes that:
1. It would be the addresses that were tainted and not the coins and
2. The addresses wouldn't be tainted proportionately
If neither of these were implemented, then one could "ruin" the currency in someone's address just by sending them bad coins. I suspect that's not the proposal - in fact, I pretty much can't see that  would be the case so long as the address was marked clean or at least not marked bad explicitly.
Coins are not automatically mixed, and the coin selection algorithm used by various bitcoin clients could be changed. If you have a 10 BTC "coin" "in" an address and I send you 10 BTC, you don't have a 20 btc coin or 20 1 btc coins, you have 2 10 btc "coins" associated with that address. You are free to NOT spend the 10 I sent. If the coins themselves are tainted instead of the address, then I can't make your other coins bad by sending you bad coins unless you merge them.
If you do merge them, then the taint trackers can either do proportional tainting or complete tainting. That is, if you merge the clean and "bad" 10 btc coins, you could either end up with a 20 btc coin that was 50% bad or a 20 btc coin that was 100% bad according to the list maintainer.

Most of the good things you listed are paid for by local property or gasoline taxes. A defensive military might justify a *small* federal tax (though wage tax is still a shitty way to do it). Most of the federal dollars go to:

A big problem as I see it is that humans have personal motives which can conflict with their stated political goals. Over time bureaucracies tend to focus on justifying their own existence even at the expense of the purpose they were started for. I work near a military base. If the military budget were cut, I'm sure people would come out of the woodwork to lobby about how their job is integral to the safety of the country even if such a statement was false on closer examination.
This is compounded because people want someone else to take care of problems. This is both because people tend to be lazy and people like to complain and blame others for failings. It's like when the Bruins win, they're "my team" but when they lose they're "those guys." If Obama or someone fucks up, then he can be the lightning rod rather than the people who elected him or even participated in a system of blindly trusting others to solve problems instead of spending the time to make sure that they were buying from reputable people or working out problems with their neighbors.
Many also love authority - it's one of Haidt's moral foundations. Government as an institution provides the paternalism and maternalism that some crave. Authority worship is very visible when discussing soldiers or police; people give cops a lot of lattitude to solve problems but fear civilians solving problems in the same manner.
I have an idea for a system which would (hopefully) promote accountability by making the people themselves responsible - and lowering the costs of discovery and action.
1. Charter city - it has to be from scratch to eliminate the resistance to change
2. Bitcoin - currency which is solid and also traceable
3. Transparency - when the government knows things about the citizens but there's no mirror, that's bad. It took Bradley Manning to show some of the realities of war. If everything is visible to everyone, there's a lot less bullshit. This can't be a complete replacement for trust, but it can damn sure help.
4. Competition for natural opportunities by bidding. If you want land or minerals or EM spectrum use, you pay. The money goes through the charter corportion and is disbursed equally to everyone (dividend).
5. Towns and governments can bid just like everyone else and are free to impose whatever taxes they want. People can leave those towns without moving if they stop using the towns infrastructure (or buy it out). (panarchy)
6. Individual enforcement comes from tainting and dissociating from money held by groups and individuals who are doing "bad things." This takes the fun out of fungability. While people could try to avoid bitcoin if that's how one pays to have land, then they're kind of stuck with it. This is actually how anti-money-laundering laws work so well - people need fiat. A few notes: there'd need to be a pre-ban phase so new people aren't stuck with shit money without warning, banned money couldn't be contributed to land taxes by anyone who shunned it, banned money would not be disbursed to shunners, banned money would be worth Pnb/P for purposes of taxation where Pnb is the population who didn't ban it over the total population.
Some problems right off the bat that this solves / good things it enables:
1. Government programs which never go away
2. Good versus bad tax discovery
3. Good versus bad voting system discovery
4. Reduces the cost of trust
5. Reduces the cost of truth
6. Reduces, by proxy, the cost of trade
7. Traceable money eliminates most B.S. which is driven by "who benefits."
8. Solves "impossible" problems like abortion, IP, animals rights, polluters given a pass, etc. because people can just shun those (and the money of people) who piss them off or start a new government fairly cheaply
9. Cuts out the bankers who are 90% of the problem in the U.S.
10. More efficient use of land - pay for what you're excluding others from
11. Favors rehabilitation by letting people pony up their future dividends as a guarantee that someone is cured in exchange for a portion of the cured person's future dividends.

Well, presumably, Walmart, Amazon, etc. need to check with CoinValidation to see if an address is whitelisted before allowing a purchase.

Bitcoins don't have value - they ARE valued by others. You can certainly get benefits from exchanging control of them and that's what they'd consider income most likely - even though benefits is also subjective.

If fiat currencies can't compete, then let the best system win. Paying taxes and buying oil are two primary drivers for the dollar's value. The first is backed by the IRS, the second is backed by the military. The latter will be running into trouble soon as they come up against China and Russia. However, there is still a large tax base in the U.S.: land. Taxes on real property are pretty unavoidable.
The government would have to give up the following though:
1. Ability to pay as a benchmark for tax liability
2. Being able to set arbitrary rates (taxes on real property are resisted much more strongly in the case of evaluations considered unfair). Being able to fund boondoggles and put the future into debt.
3. The ability to tax non-landowner citizens living overseas
I happen to think that LVT is the least bad tax and actually provides a number of benefits in both statist and anarchist systems.


Investing in anything is a risk. Nothing about laws, norms, money, or taxes in the future is certain. It's possible to do all the "right" things and get burned. I'm personally not investing for retirement through traditional vehicles because I suspect the dollar will either be strongly devalued or the government will get grabby.
The four best investments you can have are:
1. Productive land. This is, of course, taxable by government
2. A good support network of trusted people with different skills - not taxable
3. A good set of skills - not taxable
4. Good health - not taxable
Those are the four areas I would suggest people focus on for retirement.


Wealth disparities depend on property and property, like all rights, are just normative agreements. A molotov cocktail will burn down both a mansion and a shanty. If wealth disparity gets too great, everyone - even the rich - lose out. Sure, a bitcoin might eventually be sufficient to buy a mansion, but if one can't actually buy a mansion without getting routed by the poor rabble, its purchasing power is kept somewhat in check.


If I become a bitcoin billionaire, I plan to start a charter city based on bitcoin, geoism, and panarchism. Maximal opportunity for all. Granted, my investment is to provide myself with psychic benefits - I simply want to see it exist. Who knows how things will turn out?


Neither bitcoin nor dollars are wealth. They are drafts on wealth. The wealth will remain. If it is displaced, it's because people want that more than the alternatives given the circumstances they find themselves in. Luck is definitely a major factor and, if bitcoin ends up being the currency of the future, many of us will have lucked into it (being in the right place at the right time to hear about it) while others would've had bad luck to believe in the future viability of fiat currencies. But there is also the risk that many of us are taking that our time and investments will turn out to be fruitless. It's easy to cry "sour grapes" when one doesn't see the risk and nailbiting nights many of us have taken or had.


The primary solution is not, as some say, to set up dispute resolution organizations. It's to not cede power at all. Living among good neighbors who aren't desparate is what prevents kidnapping far more than police. Drugs, insider trading, illegal files, even kiddie porn (as long as no actual child was used to make it) I don't care about.
A way to reduce crime while preventing corruption is to have everyone be their own detective and enforcer. People can be detectives in a transparent society. People can be enforcers by blacklisting the money of others. Bitcoin allows the latter. If the government demanded payment of taxes in bitcoin (assuming they cave to the OPs presumed inevitable scenario), and levy it on assets which can't be hidden (land and other immovables), they can demand payment from certain registered addresses.
Though most governments wouldn't do this, one solution to lack of policing is let people say "I refuse to count X's address as viable" and eat some of the costs themselves. This would make taxes more expensive for shunned people. Would racists use it? Sure. But the number of racists is small. Would people use it to punish people who refuse to go to court or some arbitration process? Yup. And that number is far higher.
With bitcoin the money itself could be marked (tainted). With public pronouncement ahead of time, no one is screwed. People hate on BP for the oil spill. BP suddenly can't pay anyone because no one will accept their money as it is worthless for paying taxes. Perhaps there is a condition for BP to get their money "repatriated" (donate half to gulf restoration or something - the old Ocean's 11 holding half your money hostage trick).


No. The government will fight it but lose. They literally CANNOT shut down the internet - it's the only thing keeping people passive enough to accept the current bullshit and doing so would end the economy. The goverment won't be able to stop decentralized exchanges or bartering. They WILL be able to stop manufacturers and retail from accepting it easily.
They could always go back to a land/property tax or, at the federal level, a per-capita tax levied on the states rather than people directly. The implant thing is fantasy.


Solution: LVT. Move power local. Citizen's dividend paid for out of taxes, eliminate welfare entirely. (This should be done anyways as technological unemployment is a real possibility in this century.)


It could also help a lot of people such as those the U.S. bombs.

I agree that Zerocoin is an improvement over bitcoin. For the record, are *a significant amount* of things which I think bitcoin does wrong and could be improved upon. However, the governments of the world are not going to get behind Zerocoin precisely because it weakens their control.
The best thing that could happen right now is Bitcoin gets big, governments eventually *have* to allow it, and then Zerocoin functionality gets rolled in. Unfortunately, it's currently a forking change, which ends up causing a similar problem as trying to bootstrap a new alt-coin.

No true... or rather only true because the current clients merge coins without checking for taint. If I send you a fake $10 bill and you already have a (non-fake) $10 bill, it doesn't suddenly transform into a half-fake $20 bill. You can just NOT spend the fake $20 bill. Similarly, taint is not attached to addresses, but to bitcoins themselves, which are a chain of signatures.

It seems that the interceptor could piece together the message but would be unable to fend off the coordinated attack even if they knew what time it would occur. The primary problem is coordinating the attack if you don't know if any number of your messengers have been compromised - which is why you can't rely on "majority rules."
With proof-of-work, it appears to me that so long as at least one true message gets through, the attack can be coordinated - though I suspect it would take a few messages back and forth if the two armies are of similar proof-of-work power, to get everyone working on the same work chain.

Thing is, just like the stretching theft argument, bitcoins aren't really *transferred* per se. If I tell you a secret and you make a new secret and tell someone else, what has been transferred except maybe knowledge? Hence thoughtcrime.
The bitcoins themselves don't **go** anywhere, they're just numbers in a blockchain. Still, tax laws can hypothetically be made to tax anything people allow: baldness, loud mufflers, speaking Spanish, [goatees]( believing in God, being a white person, whatever. Some just seem *stupider* than others.
Also, what if I don't value bitcoins, but don't want the state to gain revenue? Since bitcoins aren't valuable from my end, can I give them away and not have them be taxed (since they aren't valuable to me)? What if the recipient also doesn't consider them valuable and didn't ask to receive them? I know, it's annoying philosocrap, but it's still poses some problems for taxing tokens of value. Does it have to be valued by just anyone? More than a few, less than all? Anyone want to draw a Schelling Fence to make a distinction there?

States can be granted different rights than individuals though the romantic in me really does lean toward the "no delegating what you don't find justifiable if you did" stance.
The state could've even formed largely voluntarily:
1. Settlers decide that public goods need to be provided and voluntarily (though perhaps under threat of starvation) agree to some form of taxation while living in a jurisdiction.
2. Settlers further agree to pass on this obligation as an easement on their land.
3. People buy land knowing *full well* the situation in place and *benefit* from the cheaper price of land due to such obligations being priced in.
4. Those people are under obligation now too since they voluntarily agreed when buying the land with such an easement.

It's theft in deprival of opportunity sense - it's like changing the password on a safe, but never opening it or taking the money out - it still screws the original password holder unless they can guess the new password (which is close to a 0% chance).
The larger point is that of justification. By some standards it's theft, by others it's not. People who choose to accept the ledger as authoritative are saying "possession proves ownership." Otherwise why the hell are they running clients which automatically accept blocks instead of prompting them to say "yea or nay" for each transaction? They are actually saying possession is ownership NORMATIVELY too (due to their hatred of tainted coins and other appeals to external ownership determiners). Bitcoin is currency by consensus. You are free to try to get others to change their standard of ownership and fork the chain. It wouldn't be bitcoin at that point, per se, but you'd still have "ownership."
It's similar to how their both can and cannot be theft of bearer bonds. Bearer bonds are owned by whoever possesses them - at least in the banks' opinion. So, from their perspective, a bearer bond cannot be stolen because whoever possesses it, for whatever reason, IS the owner of it by the fact of their possession. However, from the perspective of others, such bonds CAN be stolen (for instance, [this guy's opinion]( in the movie Heat).

In principle, treating currency as the confluence of truth, trust, and trade and refusing to trade in Nazi gold or blood diamonds or tainted bitcoin is not a problem. In practice it is. Furthermore, without well-known addresses, it's pretty much impossible to implement well.
The flip side of tainted coins are colored coins (which also break fungibility, but no one seems to care). In both cases, individuals decide that a coin is worth more or less than any other coin. If you believe in freedom of association and acting on information you can obtain, then calm yourself.
What I consider good reasons to be against tainted coins:
1. It can't be done well without well-known / registered addresses
2. Without a state or something similar demanding payment of taxes in bitcoin, which causes the usefulness of bitcoin to outweigh people's fungibility concerns, people will switch to another currency in which they can hide their "sins." Taint harms bitcoin in the absence of [such a system](
What I consider bad reasons to be against tainted coins:
1. Mah portfolio!
2. Currency must be fungible! No, sorry, fraud and theft don't *have* to be things people just accept. That's what technology is for (politics is a shit way of dealing with social problems). It used to be that centralization and physical exchange were necessities before bitcoin - people decided they could do better. If there was a [dollar bill that would turn black as soon as it was stolen]( the world would probably be a better place. The trick is to have it turn black before some innocent person recieves it. If you're against such a system then you're probably an asshole who just wants to protect the portfolio (see

I'd very much like the default state to be one of trust - society works better with more trust. But I consider trust in individuals and trust in institutions to be very different things.
The need for trust can be reduced somewhat by an increase in transparency; bitcoin is an example of this. Trusting companies to vouch for people is, in my opinion, heading in the wrong direction. It's a default state of distrust in individuals but a state of trust in institutions and companies. I'd rather look up verified information available to everyone than be require to trust what a business or institution days without sharing said information. Of course, some services might be highly transparent which I'd favor.

In order for people to do anything, they need access to nature. If people are in their way, then they need permission to do anything (including live), they effectively have no right to self-ownership.
Self-ownership requires self requires existence requires access to nature. If any prerequisites of something are a privilege, then that thing is a privilege. If access to nature is a privilege, then self-ownership is a privilege.
The standard counter is that food is necessary. But people don't need to buy food, they can grow it. One can't grow access to nature. The second argument is that people can buy access by renting or purchasing, but they need to be able to be somewhere to work to get the money to do that, so it's circular. The third argument is people can seastead, but, first of all, where do they get the materials for the boats to get out there and secondly what happens when the best (most supportive of life) areas are claimed like they are now with land? It just kicks the can down the road.
That said, I don't think that people should have to lose their efforts put into land so others can have access, but I do believe a balance needs to be struck for any form of anarchy which doesn't rely on state-like institutions to be practical.

The counter to that is go live in North Korea if you think you're better off with 100% government. Also, I get yelled at a lot when pointing out the same logic with pushing abortion rights to the state level - pregnant women can just catch a bus to the next state over.
Everyone has to make their own judgements about the rightness or wrongness of such an action, and judge the consequences. They shouldn't be making a decision mindlessly either by living in fear of the IRS or a belief that there are no consequences.

If we're going to continue to have a government, I want them to switch to LVT now because it's far better by most metrics that I care about than income or sales taxes. So it's win-win for me.
LVT would be very visible compared to income taxes. It'd hit the wealthy harder and couldn't be passed on like those other taxes and, since the wealthy have the ears of the politicians, anything which hits the wealthy too hard will be fought. LVT would (hypothetically) aid in localism.

No, not soon, and not in the way that AnCaps want (for the record I'm neither AnCap nor AnSoc). But I do see states as less necessary. You don't need people to tell you what to do, others need to shield themselves from your effects or to neutralize you.
Let's see where the tech is headed.
1. Virtual reality or mind upload. If this happens, states aren't needed as I the universe of the machine won't let me steal or kill. Stealing is kind of irrelevant anyways as I can just zap a table into existence.
2. People can know everything about anyone at any time. Outlawing drones isn't going to work - especially as they get smaller. The government and business used to be able to fool people a lot more than they can now. The only downside now is that people drown in TOO MUCH information (think Brave New World over 1984). The lie that justifies coercive rule and even representatives will come under increasing attack. This has happened before:
* Zog biggest, he deserve to rule
* My father was a great warrior, I deserve to rule
* I am god, I deserve to rule
* I'm not god, but I speak to god, I deserve to rule
* I don't speak to god, but I've been given a mandate, so I deserve to rule
\3. 3D printers - guns, drugs, anything you want (maybe). Good luck stopping that.
\4. Either people can have safety with technology (the state becomes largely irrelevant since that's mostly what it's purported use is), or it's not (in which case people will push for more statism until the system collapses).

I hope it'll cause government to see that wage and sales taxes are stupid. They can always go back to taxing real property - [preferably only land and not buildings or improvements](
Governments rarely do things because it's the right or logical thing to do but only because they can't afford to continue doing the wrong thing. For instance, pot is starting to become legal because the costs of prosecuting the drug war, importing hemp and losing the hemp export market to other countries, and losing potential marijuana taxes are too high (Pun?). It's not because the people in charge suddenly realized that:
1. People should be able to put whatever they want in their bodies and
2. The federal government has no *actual* constitutional authority to regulate marijuana.

Yes, you could luck out, but the average time is 10 minutes for any miner worldwide to find one. There have been times when several blocks are solved within a few minutes of one another and others where they are over an hour apart. Though the differences are often not that extreme, they can happen with an average. The average can also be skewed by a sudden ingress or egress of miners from the network.
As I understand it the challenge has the components of the version and some other various info, the merkle tree root for the transactions in the block - including the one which awards new coins - and the hash of the previous block. You then have to find a nonce which, when hashed with those things, produces a value lower than the value which is computed from the current difficulty.

Only own the amount of land that you need or want to use. If the LVT is higher than the value the average person can get from excluding others from a piece of land, then a lot of people would be pissed off at the government.

You don't have to fight the government directly... you just **do** things and ensure you don't get caught. How well has the government been able to shut down localbitcoins.com? Exactly.
Also, people, especially libertarians have to stop being such whiny pussies. I gave a speech at PorcFest this year about how you don't have natural rights and you don't need them. Stop asking for subsidies for your rights. You get rights by getting others to respect your claims. That means they either need to love or fear you (unless you're going the Galt's Gulch route). If government agents are going to be assholes, Bitcoin is near perfect for a certain idea put forth by Jim Bell a while ago...
... I'm not suggesting any particular course of action. I'm suggesting that people figure out what they want and then do things to get what they want whether that's legal or not. I have near zero faith in the government so I'm not going to cry if people violate the law for the sake of bitcoin or even back that up bitcoin's success with violence. (Whether that would lead to success is a different story, but assuming it would, why should I care what happens to statists?)

I'm a geopanarchist and it appeals to me because it can force governments to tax pollution and exclusion of others from natural resources instead of wage and sales taxes. It can also empower individuals within a transparent society to be their own value-enforcers by being non-fungible if people choose to treat it that way.

What's useful to have:

2. Just laws - some are, many aren't
3. Police - many are writing tickets instead of solving crime, but they're paid for by property taxes
4. Firefighters - property taxes
5. Educated populace - most schooling is indoctrination. Regardless - property taxes AND it could be done far cheaper (&lt;=50%) than what it costs now
Things that people say I need
1. FDA - nope
2. EPA - maybe, but their budget is quite small
3. FBI - Meh
4. ATF - No
5. NSA - No
6. CIA - No
7. DEA - Hell no
8. DHS - Hell no
Military - some. Standing armies are to be avoided. No country is going to attack a nuclear country without provocation. For non-state actors, leaving them alone works. For an actual invasion, that's why citizens have guns.
So, let's add up what the federal government "needs" according to me
Military that's slightly better than the next best one (China) = $110b/y
All other federal government operations = $100b/y
Social security, medicare, medicaid, interest on debt = gone. With the exception of the latter, they won't be there for me so fuck the greatest generation and boomers who got this situation going.
Debt - I don't care.

Currency doesn't have to be much more than a unit of account. I don't see a problem with people doing things for one another so long as they take the risk that the purchasing power of that currency later may go down or someone who they have lent currency to may renege or die.
The real issue, as I see it, and where I diverge from many libertarians, is on the issue of access to nature and natural opportunities. I don't believe that rights are these magical things which can be derived solely from logic sans desires and dispositions. Still, given the desires and propensities many have, personal property seems to be widely recognized. Exclusive ownership and denial of others to access nature... not so much, and thus the state is born or at least aided to function as an enforcer.
If one believes in a right of self ownership, then one must believe in a right to self (since you can't dereference the *null* pointer). If you believe in a right to self, then you must believe in a right to the prerequisites of existence. If any prerequisite of existence is a privilege, then self is a privilege, and then self dot anything (such as self-ownership) is a privilege.
That doesn't mean that others have to provide you with something or that you have to achieve it (nature can be a bitch), but such a view would mean that no one would be legitimate in interfering with that - you know, your standard negative right.
I'll leave off for now, but will respond if asked questions.

Doxxing + drones + guns = problem individual reduction. If you want me to make this post more bitcoin related fine: bitcoin assassination politics.
But businesses won't do that because they don't want to start a ruckus - they just want money. Then fine, don't do business with them. It's not like Amazon is taking your bitcoins now. But if you want to trade BTC to Joe the Plumber, then fuck the government and its enforcers if they want to interfere in that. The question, to paraphrase film, is "do you possess the constitution to go as far is as needed?"
The state is coming to an end either by humanity being destroyed or some sort of post-state semi-stable weird time.
Back in the 1600's the state had maybe 2 or 3 times the power of the  civilians. Now it's more like 1,000 to 1. However, technology has been improving. The civilians used to have 1, now they have 40 or maybe 50. Let's say that magic "can fuck up society number" is 100. At some point it doesn't matter if the state has a million times more power than civilians if civilians can also destroy society. The people who comprise the state and who, for lack of a better term, worship it will *have* to back off when the small minority who want freedom more than safety say "if you fuck with us, we'll release a super-virus and make everyone lose!"
Now, this will get downvoted for promoting violence and hurting people's feelings. Fine. I accept that. But that's where the technology is going - either humans get their shit together and make it a world people want to live in instead of FEARING to live in, or fears will be made manifest by those with no qualms about using technology as a force multiplier.

People use open source for a lot of different reasons. Fungibility has benefits and drawbacks. If I could snap my fingers and bring into existence the following world, I would immediately:
1. People have only one identity
2. The identity-assignment process is incorruptible.
3. You can boycott other's money for any reason, but no one who got that money before the boycott would be punished.
4. You pay to exclude others from natural resources and all that money is collected and paid out equally as a dividend. This solves the "you need a job" / "technological unemployment" problems and makes invalid 95% of progressive economic arguments.
5. You can't pay using currency YOU tainted. You can't get a dividend from money YOU tainted.
6. The value of your currency for paying the natural resource exclusion "fee" is related to how much people dislike you. In a society of 1,000 people, if 10 people hate me, then my 100 BTC is worth 99 for the purpose of paying this fee.
7. Taints are publicly registered and cannot be denied. So you can taint the tainter.
8. A transparent or near transparent society.
9. People can form whatever governments, communes, whatever they want. The only rules is: pay to exclude people - that's how you get stability.
If some of those fail, the system is worse than now from a human goal actualization perspective. If they all work, then it's a new veritable "age of Aquarius."  and  are the biggest technological problems.  is a political problem but will become more and more obvious as one of the safest paths to tread in a world where anyone can wipe out hundreds of people at any time.

So, I was thinking on the drive into work about one way to deal with this. It helps those who are holding bitcoins as an investment if prices are cheaper in bitcoin, increasing demand. Unfortunately, classic free rider problem, everyone is hoping someone else will spend their BTC to help the ecosystem so the free rider can hold their own BTC.
Would it be a good idea to have some kind of "improve the bitcoin ecosystem" assurance contract where people can put in some BTC with the goal of more than making up the donations on the increase in demand for their other bitcoin holdings? Three types of investments that such a fund could make which would increase demand for bitcoin:
1. New clients or tools which make it extremely easy to use with little risk of lost bitcoins due to wallet loss, hacking, n00b mistakes.
2. New exchanges which are easier to get money in and out of and are very hard for governments to shut down
3. Discounts on purchases through bitcoin.
Let's focus on the third one for now.
1. I'll chip in, say 2BTC to an assurance contract which will give discounts to buyers of goods and services from bitcoin merchants.
2. Perhaps people get to vote on who gets to be included in this list and the weight of their vote is the amount of BTC donated.
3. If anyone wants to donate money to make this a dominant assurance contract (e.g. people invest and get &gt; 100% of their investment back if not enough people chip in), that'd be appreciated.
4. Buyers get a rebate at the end of the month in proportion to the amount donated divided multiplied by the percenate of the total they spent at approved merchants.
The big problem I see with this is that merchants might issue a lot of fake purchases to try to get free bitcoins from the service. Any thoughts on how to avoid this?

I've actually messed with this recently in the code just to learn more about ECC.
You pick a large integer D which is your private key. You then multiply the G value of a well-known elliptical curve to generate a point P which is your public key.
P = curve.G.Multiply(D)
D and P are related in the traditional public-private keypair ways.
Let SeedD be your private seed value and SeedP be your public seed value.
Now, pick a number which is your RNG seed S and share it. Both parties have the same values being spit out of their RNG because they were both seeded with the same value.
The next private key is SeedD * RNG output. The next public key is SeedP multiplied by RNG output. The produced private keys and public keys will be in lockstep.
Psuedo-code-wise, it looks like:
Priv1 = SeedD*RNG(S).Next(), Pub1 = SeedPub.Multiply(RNG(S).Next())
Priv2 = SeedD*RNG(S).Next().Next(), Pub1 = SeedPub.Multiply(RNG(S).Next.Next())
You wouldn't write it like that, but that's conceptually how it works.
The nice thing is that this allows web servers to come advance to the next bitcoin address when making sales, but not have access to the private keys for those addresses in the event that the web server is compromised.

2. Buying things the government doesn't want you to be able to - so long as it's easy to ship. Drugs, gun parts, and especially information.
3. Selling information or items online which carry a high risk of credit card chargeback. Music, art, digital books, etc.
4. Agorist businesses - if they don't have a bank account and an EIN, the IRS can't do much about them.
5. Store of wealth - so long as people can use bitcoin for remittances and forbidden fruits ( and  and nothing better comes on the scene, bitcoin will always be valued. Given the hard limits, it's likely that bitcoin will be a good store of wealth compared to fiat even if it can't be used as currency in nearly as many places.

No! It's shit. Taxing people on income or sales is FUCKING STUPID. There's a thing governments can tax RIGHT NOW that people can't hide and tracks well with how much people are harming others --- it's called LAND.
Do you ever watch any of those doom-and-gloom technological unemployment videos (which aren't entirely incorrect)? Do you ever have arguments with progressives who complain about wealth inequality and jobs going overseas? What's the REAL problem? ACCESS TO LAND - you need to live *somewhere* and you usually need to pay someone (landlord, previous seller, a bank). That makes it so you need a job TO LIVE.
One of my biggest  hopes with Bitcoin, a hope I maintain, [is that it will make things so hard for the IRS that the U.S. will have no choice but to go back to taxing land or something similarly non-hideable]( and actually justifiably taxable from this libertarian's perspective.
Then all these "non-crimes" of money laundering, buying something with more than $10,000 in cash, trading with a consenting adult without reporting it to daddy government can disappear.

That causes the standard over-reaction which drives more people to against them.

The arguments I've heard against tainted coins (other than it might make Bitcoin less useful) is that it's not fair to the people who got coins but didn't know they were stolen. Bear in mind that all tainted coins really are are coins which people HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT. But people don't want things outside of the system affecting the system. They want to abide by the rules of math and the bitcoin system.

Do the clients time the transaction out after a while (yes, I know that a miner could always pick it up at some point) but IIRC, the client will claim that you have no money and won't let you do a double-spend even if the first transaction isn't being accepted. If one could re-issue a transaction with a higher fee, then the first transaction would become invalid - but it's entirely up to the client to broadcast what it thinks will be a double spend.

Well, we have anarchy now seeing as how a world government doesn't exist. If you treat individual nation states as individuals, there are power balances there that lead the "individuals" to keep the relative peace.
I'm not for or against the idea, but threats of violence to keep people "in line" can keep the peace - though it's questionable if it's voluntary. If someone makes it know that they'll hunt me down if I hurt his family, is my choice to not hurt his family voluntary? That sort of thing.
However, this is taking action ahead of time to prove that one is willing and able to back that up; it's initiatory. Except... while I don't ascribe to collective blame in the abstract, these people are wearing the titles and uniforms of an group normally known to be oppressors. Just like I wouldn't wear Blood colors in Cryp territory, neither are these individuals wise to put themselves at risk by wearing the markings and titles of individuals who identify with and work for the oppressor group.
I believe it was you who said elsewhere that the state fucks everything up and leads to shitty choices and lifeboat ethics. There are three vectors for changing the behavior of others or of making it irrelevant:
1. Change their beliefs. The beliefs of statists tend to be fucked up, but not ALL of them are. Some correctly believe that authoritarianism works for what they care about (at least for a while). Desires themselves are not wrong except as judged by other desires.
2. Change their desires or the relative strengths of their dispositions and aversions. If they want to rob from you, use the fact that they like getting shot less than they like robbing. It doesn't matter if they stop stealing from you because they're "found Jesus" or they fear you so long as they stop.
3. Remove their opportunities. Don't have money in a bank and the IRS can't take it. Be hard for agents to track down. Neutralize people who, for lack of a better term, suck.
I'm not supporting or disparaging assassination markets. I'm just not so sure they will or won't work. The timing does seem suspicious though.

Someone pays you a check with certain public conditions which are very difficult for anyone other than you to match.
You want to buy something, so you need to write your own check with conditions they can match. But you'll need to use one or more of your checks.
Unfortunately, it's unlikely any of your checks is the right amount, so you need to either
1. Take a large check and convert it into two or more checks and give all but one to yourself.
2. Give the person multiple of your checks.
As part of the transaction, you need to prove that you are authorized to use those checks, so you provide proof which meets the condition set by the previous holder of those checks before (s)he transferred them to you.
Replace checks with bitcoins and it's pretty accurate.
Two other things:
1. If you write total checks for less than the checks you're using, whoever mines the block your transaction is in gets the difference
2. The miner gets a reward "check from nowhere" for mining a block. This is how bitcoins are introduced into the system.

4. Fixed supply

Here's something I ask anarchists: if anarchy is so workable, then why aren't people implementing it now?
The usual response is "the state" which is either a copout or true. For instance some DRO could arrest those false charge laying Adam Kokesh arresting officers. That is they could go to those people's houses and bring overwhelming force to get them to go to an arbitration service. Done correctly, the existing government couldn't do much about it in the moment if the DRO operated in the shadows...
... Or they could and whoever the most powerful or respected group is will be the new state.
If it's the former, then anarchists are just ideological pussies who are waiting for something to happen without putting in the effort. If it's the latter then anarchy cannot work without something to prevent groups from becoming too powerful or respected.
The only way I can conceive of viable anarchy is to have power in the hands of the people. That means detection and enforcement in *their* hands. Any attempt to cede responsibility and power to others who promise to represent your will is the road to statism.

Roads, firefighters, schools, public water, a fair amount of infrastructure come from property taxes (almost always). And property taxes aren't something you can avoid with bitcoin.
Bullshit such as the NSA, killing foreigners, the drug war, etc. tend to come from wage or sales taxes typically at a state (and most often) federal level and those types of taxes as (more) easy to avoid with Bitcoin.
Research is the one thing on that list which isn't really funded locally. IIRC that's 1% MAAAAYBE 2% of the federal budget (in the U.S.). It's simply not worth it to me to fund 98% of other things most of which are shit because there's a few % I agree with if I can avoid it - though I'd end up doing that anyways since I wouldn't quit my day job.

Speculation has some things in common with science. With science, luck can play a role but people who generally have better ideas about pertinent connections tend to produce working theories. Similarly, people who have better ideas about pertinent connections of states of affairs to the price of something tend to get money from those who don't. In both cases people can get screwed by spending their time working under a bad hypothesis or losing money to those who sized up the market situation better than they did.
Luck falls randomly and can be ignored because there's no way to correct for luck without making the overall systems (both science and markets) worse. If good scientists are rewarded, people will begin to seek out better methods for finding connections. If good speculators are rewarded, the same.
The market is working to find ways to make accurate predictions by selecting against those who don't.

You are correct, not in a meta-moral sense, but in practicality. People respect the institution of government and grant it rights. If they stopped respecting it, it would cease to have those rights.
As far as BTC and tax evasion, the middle ground I take is that, barring a workable solution, there's going to be government. Taking power away from the government when it is corrupt (as it is now) is something I feel should be done. I don't limit the means of achieving that to working within the system.
Roads, police, fire departments are nearly all paid for locally or, at worst, at the state level. For unavoidable taxes like property and land taxes, bitcoin won't prevent tax liabilities. For the intrusive taxes (wage, capital gains, to a lesser degree sales) which largely go to fund *bullshit*, the government will need to accept the new reality of those no longer being effective if bitcoin takes off. My opinion on that? Too bad so sad.

You either donate money as someone who wants to pay into the deadpool or you pay money to guess. The cost or payout of a guess should be proportional to the expected remaining lifespan of the individual in question. In your guess you have an encrypted file with the date and the payout address. Since the date is encrypted, no one at the organization can warn the potential victim.
If the person dies whether naturally or with a little help, the organization stops taking bets, but can still accept further donations if people want to pay the guesser more after the fact. The guessers have a few days to "come forward" which they do by sending the keys to decrypt their message. The message shows that they guessed the correct date and the bitcoin address is there to make a payment to. The organization sends the money to that address.
Some interesting consequences:
1. One need not kill a person to win the bet. In fact, a deadpool with no assassinations could be an indicator of how unpopular someone is and, due to the fact that scarce currency is invested, is probably more accurate than random or exit polling.
2. Assassins can leave the decryption keys with their next of kin so, even if they get killed following their (successful) attempt, their family or friends can get paid.
3. Would-be victims who know what might be coming (based on their observations of their own deadpool amount) can "cheat the hangman" by betting and killing themselves on a certain date and leaving the money to their next of kin - kind of a perverse life insurance policy.

I did, still cost me less though your mileage may vary. Here's the thing about bureaucracies, they love metrics - things that are definable and easy to get win over other things. Unless the goal is to target bitcoin itself, the average bitcoin user is safe since 99% of tax evaders are doing things which are easier to catch.
Yes, you can't buy a house with bitcoin without reporting it, but you can pay for repairs on it, you can pay your mortgage with your visible income and use bitcoins to live cheaper. Hiding $20,000 per year is easy.

It could've been effective had they continued to focus on the bank bailouts and crony capitalism. Then they got all "progressive stacking" and "MAH FEELINGZ" and it turned into a *we need more government, tax the rich (even if they didn't do anything involving privilege), and various social issues* movement. It got dilluted.

Agreed. I called it too. You're one of the only *sane* people in this sub anymore now that it's been filled with late adopters who tend to be statists or state apologists.
I'm not saying Bitcoin might not need to *play ball* sometimes to be left alone... oh wait, I am saying that since "blah blah children blah blah safety blah blah terror" will always be an excuse to change or reinterpret the law in favor of the state!

Wouldn't it make more sense to slowly cash out while in the U.S. The IRS can't prove you didn't spend that money and they sure as hell won't see you crossing the border with it. You'll have to buy your Bitcoins in cash or register under a different TIN if you're buying them on an exchange.
In the other country, you couldn't cash them out to a bank account unless the country didn't have an extradition treaty.

For me it's because bitcoin represents more freedom both in use as a currency and, for me personally, as a speculative asset which can greatly reduce my mortgage - allowing me more *freedom* to work on the projects I want to.

It'll still work better than healthcare.gov.

Do we know what country the web server was hosted in? I assume(d) that Iceland and Sweden tell the U.S. to fuck off, for instance.

Also, this is the ultimate wage of working with the state. All of those numbskulls which said "don't forget to pay your taxes!" and "regulation will help legitimize bitcoin" will reap what they wanted sewn.
Personally, I think a lot of people are just in it for the money. If regulation and paying taxes make their portfolios go up, they are fine with it. If regulation makes bitcoin less fungible and lowers its value, suddenly they're against regulation.

You're allowed to list cash as cheaper, but not CC's as more expensive. It's weird, but those are generally part of the merchant service terms.

I just did Bitfloor today but took a bit of a haircut. If the rally continues at present rates, that'll be erased by end of day today.

Seriously, why are dumbasses pretending like the law matters? The law can be set up to favor existing businesses or changed on a whim so long as terrorism or safety is used somewhere in the justification.
Don't rely on laws to save you. Don't register your business with the IRS. Don't make it a "legit" non-profit. Just do it... and cover your ass with *technology* so, even if they want to stop it, they can't.
Or, make it worth it for them to not piss you off. For instance, if I was an evil mastermind I'd do the following if bitcoin ever got made illegal:
1. Kidnap the person who made it illegal or their child
2. Ransom that person/child IN BITCOIN for more than can be mined in the timeframe they're allowed
3. Watch the government have to go to individuals and *buy* bitcoin from them in effect bailing those individuals out for their potential loss.
4. Sit back and lol.
