Banks don't lose money to crypto. There is no money leaving the banks, only moving from one bank account to another.

Not true, that money isn't in crypto. You buy crypto and transfer money to somebody else, so it shifts to a different bank. That's 221 billion can't be transfered to dollars on a bank account. Who would transfer that money to the accounts if everybody wants to sell. Somebody needs to buy and transfer cash from a bank to give you cash on a bank.

Bought about a month ago at 10.400 because FOMO, HODled all through the ups and downs last month. Didn't sell. 
Today I'm down, not much though. But decided to buy more.

Going up 1k every day isn't good either. Just gets followed by a dip, which gets followed by fear

How is the money shifting away from the banks?
They are loosing business and opportunities.

The money person B used to buy those Bitcoin has transferred to person A his bank account.

Still makes thé prediction useless. He predicted an increase since July. While actually it has been stable/gone down since then.

Or it just hits it at any point during the month. Still pretty impressive if he hits them all. Although atm it can be luck

How about his prediction of bitcoin dominance

Slow it down. Don't want too many people selling. Fast rises only get followed by dumps
@_date: 2019-10-18 23:17:42
It's a completely different market though. Bitcoin was new previously which attracted more and more people. Now it has been well established and other things have to be done to see increase. I would say adoption will be the biggest driver in price.

Or couple of days. Anything is possible. It's only 700 away.

Any line based on past results is bs because it would mean that it would always rise or always only go down.

Or cut out the middle man and borrow from the bank that does the borrowing yourself.

Difference between 9k and 9.5k isn’t  all that great. Probably to just buy when the money is there. 9.5 has been a pretty solid bottom hopefully.

No investing if you don't have 6 to 12 months of living expenses saved up. If I had that much savings I would be driving a nicer car and getting a mortgage.

Unfortunately you first need to own a bank with a big turnover before you are allowed free money

So plenty of places going into the negative. The European Central bank has lowered their interest rate to -.5. So a bank can borrow money and get paid on that loan.
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:38:10
Japan been having negative interest rates for a while. And more countries in Europe are facing negative interest rates. 
It's the central banks that keep lowering their rates. 
So a bank can borrow money cheap or for free from the central bank, so why pay people to get their money?
