My hands are shaking reading this masterpiece. We have witnessed something which will be talked by generations over generations. Long live Satoshi or whateverthefk your real name is..

Paper wallet is too much work for newcomers but I agree paper wallet is as good as hardware wallets except ease of use. And you can never trust your hardware wallet %100 (it doesn't show you private keys) on the other hand with paper wallet you have the keys in your hand.

Firat thing you need to do is to create a wallet for yourself (mobile, desktop or paper) then you need to register at an exchange website (coinbade, bitfinex, bitstamp etc.) to transfer them fiat currency in exchange of bitcoin. Since there is a high demand to most of these web sites at the moment it takes a few days to verify your account with an ID. You can ask an already registered and trusted friend to buy/sell bitcoin for you and transfer it to your wallet though. By the way smallest bitcoin value is 0.00000001 which is called one satoshi.

Paper wallet if you're a hodler. Bitfinex if you're a trader.

I just made a quick short list of promising sides or shortcomings of bitcoin by means of investing. Could you help me to revise&amp;add&amp;delete items in the list? Would appreciate your opinions.
BITCOIN (BTC)
The Good:
- First and best known cryptocurrency. Posterchild of blockchain technology.
- A lot of mainstream attention in return lots of new investors
- Lightning Network has the potential to make transactions faster&amp;cheaper on the long run
- Market leader as in market cap
- Base store coin (When there is a bloodbath in alts people run to BTC)
The Bad:
-  First generation coin
-  Wasting too much electricity power  because of proof of work
- Block reward getting halved every 4 years which means TX fee will get to rise in time
- Currently high TX fee and relatively slow transfer speed
Opinion: Long term investment coin limiting with a certain percentage of portfolio up to %50

I see your point but what if miners stop mining BTC anymore because of lessened incentive unless BTC prices double up against USD every four years?
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:41:27
Initials match
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:16:33
Good point there. I am fixing old generation to first generation.

You mean Mt. Gox right?

Global economy all over the world is getting better. Central banks have been pumping money since last decade and there are lots of money in the circulation at the moment. And people who have that money don't want to put it in saving accounts/bonds with silly yields. Risk seeking is high so they would direct a portion of their investment into cryptocurrency if they have not already. Bitcoin would also benefit from this. I would look for the signs of global economy getting slower in the future. In that case people would be risk avoiding hence pull their money off cryptocurrencies resulting in big drops in cryptocurrencies. But currently all signs are indicating that things are going well with global economy.

60k solid

You can trade that alt coin with bitcoin in likes of bitfinex, coinbase, bitstamp and then cash it to dollar/Euro there and send it to your bank account. I'd say don't rush to wuit your job so fast unless you hate that job. Coin money is not sustainable it goes up it goes down without a clear explanation except economy is getting better so people are more risk seeking.

Is storing encrypted paper wallet in an encrypted rar file in an usb stick, in desktop comp and in e-mail a good idea? You dramatically decrease your risk of losing your private key this way
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:58:05
Tell us your reasoning behing 10k. I am all ears.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:03:29
I am not a investment oracle but all I am going for if this technology is going to replace the current payment system then It will go much beyond 20k. If it won't then it will fade away to be the biggest bubble since tulips. Even though it is currently a mass exodus to bitcoin, there is still a barrier for average joes to get in the system and I believe we will see the exponential rises inly after average joes can start investing conveniently. It takes 2 weeks for bitstamp to verify my acount how is this not a barrier?
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:48:31
But how do you back up your private key then?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:34:52
But my understanding is losing/getting stolen/getting broken your ledger or trezor is a higher possibility than a keylogger steals your private key (given that necessary precautions taken such as generating paper wallet offline). Or vice versa?
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:10:23
Technically people burn electric to make bitcoin so it can't have zero value? What do I know anyway..
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:01:26
They are not your coins if the private key is stored in a database of an exchange company no matter how trusted the exchange company is. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:17:24
Encrypted privatekey means you need to type in passphrase to send the mo ey. Unless you don't know the passphrase it could take you years to brute force it. You can check how much coin the wallet has with checking public key in blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:10:02
Which are better alternatives?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:31:20
Can someone realistically answer this question of mine? Is bitcoin an old technology compared to new cryptocurrencies such as Ripple and ethereum and in the long shot it has no chane to compete with them regarding transaction speed/fee? So that going long on bitcoin is a bad decision? Explain like you're explaining to a 5 yo please.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:53:42
Thanks mate. Looks promising
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:37:43
I am new to this shyt and my account at bitstamp hasn't got verified for 2 weeks in a row and I've got to invest in bitcoins urgently. Care to sell some of those cheap coins to me? If not, I'll understand.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:08:48
Valuable information. Everyone should invest only as much as they can afford to lose.

If you don't pay taxes what are the chances that goverment can track you down? And why would they bother unless you make millions as profit?

We all know it's a bubble. We make shytloads of money from that bubble to stop working for the shyt works that pay shyt wages. He is angry because he is scared of not being able to find modern slaves working for him to make him richer. You heard me.

Unraring the file in Safety mode with no network connection in Windows 10 is any safer against keyloggers?

How about using Monte Carlo simulation?

I guess you are right with hardware wallets are being much easier to use than paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:11:06
Don't lose the device or get it stolen or lose the 24 word recovery sheet. If anyother person reaches that recovery sheet you lose all your money. Don't show/tell anyone about your hardware wallet to reduce 5$ wrench attack chance. You should still be careful (or paranoid) having a hardware wallet.

Why is it important to join 21 million club? What's ultimate about it?

Does backlog mean transactions waiting in the queue because system can't keep up with excessive demand?
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:50:37
Let's be honest. If Bitcoin doesn't start delivering its promises of changing finance sector soon, it's going to go down fast. You heard me.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:19:11
I am definitrly jumping on central bank cryptocurrenct bandwagon as soon as they start it. Let's be honest no point at swimming against the mainstream
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:29:10
What is this 21 million club basically? Explain please like you are explaining to a 5 years old.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:25:01
I have an encrypted paper wallet (not printed) stored in an encrypted .RAR file. I put that RAR file in an USB stick, in computer and in e-mail (as an e-mail I sent to myself). This way I diversify the risk of losing it. Do you think it's a good idea? I don't think using only a hard wallet is a good idea. You lose it you are done. You got it stolen you are done. Done done done..
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:27:28
Why people invest in bitcoin then? To make profit out of bubble?
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:00:26
Thanks I got it.. I think
@_date: 2018-08-23 05:49:43
It has everything to do with bitcoin
