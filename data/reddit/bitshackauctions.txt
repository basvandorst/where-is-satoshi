Promise, it ain't a get rich quick scheme. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:08:59
On another note, eBay taking bitcoin will be a good thing for the other auction sites. Why? Because a lot people will take BTC much more serious. Realise that eBay is greedy &amp; a total rip off, then look around for alternatives. Kapisch?
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:07:35
Well, my grandad gets it and the old man that runs our local pub gets it and uses it. We can pay for beer much easier than digging around in a fluffy pocket. Not many people understand paypal, yet it's used everyday...

Lol thankyou!
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:31:06
Yup, bang on. I'm just pointing out that while it's new and merging with fiat, it's easy to get carried away with either perception, be-it, get rich quick (majority) or change the world in respect of wealth re-distribution. The happy &amp; healthy ground is somewhere in between. 
Because of the majority's intention of get rich quick, I thought it would be a good thought provoking exercise to highlight the other end of the stick, the bigger picture if you like.
It's only because our fiat is stable (for now) that we can afford to think this way. Others in parts of Europe and S.America aren't so fortunate and it's in these places we should see the value of BTC dictated by which goods and services people are willing to trade for them with and not what it's worth on a Forex type exchange.
@_date: 2014-05-04 01:27:34
Good to hear! Happy bidding or selling and please, spread the word.
@_date: 2014-05-24 18:01:10
Awesome thanks for saying so! Spread the word to fellow crypto's. Any trade in Bitcoin is like flicking the banks and governments in the balls repeatedly

@_date: 2014-05-26 11:06:50
I agree. Any kind of unbalanced perception of the potential of crypto is not neccesarrily healthy to the community. I'm just highlighting the fact that by not taking the two points onboard slightly muddy the water on the bigger picture is all.
Of course the value in fiat of btc matters, it's early days and there's no other way of referencing value atm. I feel tho that's it's the goods and services willing to be exchanged for btc which really defines its value. 
If any of us goes through what Greece, Cyprus, Iceland, Ukraine, Brazil ect has gone through then it's not the local fiat that will define its value anymore. 
It'll be what people are willing to provide for it.
Please dont put us in a box labeled 'hippy' or 'neive' as my perception on the whole thing is pretty darn clear, I'm just thinking outside the box and speaking my mind. Some agree some dont, that's always gonna be the way of the world. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 10:07:11

@_date: 2014-05-03 15:04:57
Not very many as we're really new. There's only around 35 live auctions atm &amp; they're displayed next to the category listings on the home page if that helps. Let's spread the word and get it to snowball :) The more trade in BTC, the better for everyone!
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:12:04
And that's awesome. How's it going? Do you fully live on BTC ie rent, food, water ect? Like I said it's very important, of course it is! My point was in the long run or bigger picture it's worth bearing in mind that the price and exchange to fiat is a kind of by-product. But a very neccassary one for the two markets to work together atm. 
People that have had a complete economic collapse already maybe be able to see my point easier. Let's hope it never gets that way for us ay! 
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:36:19
How can it possibly be a fad? I'm intrigued. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:03:25
XBT is BTC. The XBT comes from an International Standards Organization (ISO) that keeps a list of currencies.  If a currency is not associated with a country then it starts with an “X.”
@_date: 2014-05-24 18:05:10
Yep, ur not wrong. We're seeing steady user growth and slowly, auctions are being posted. The general vibe is 'testing the water' so far. We're very passionate though and will make it work.

@_date: 2014-05-24 21:35:36
Yup mBTC. Just multiply BTC by 1000.. It saves displaying loads of zero's for lower priced items, which in itself is confusing to glance at, maybe.

Amazing point, I certainly hadn't noticed that but you are right, the program almost glamourised the use of tor in suppressed country but demonized the west for the same thing.
Very subtle propaganda there and a  good point well made. How many others didn't spot that, quite a few I rek!

Our perogative is to keep things simple, safe &amp; functional but there are suggestions we're looking at. One is CSV upload functionality for multiple auction listings but other things like OpenCart will have to wait a while. 
We're by no means against established traders joining in, please do get involved but the inspiration behind the site was always to help individuals get in to BTC as well as promoting de-centralized currency trade. Therefore the simplicity behind the listing process was intentionally chosen as simplicity itself has proven effective time after time after time. Simple, safe &amp; easy is the ethos here i guess you could say.
Ethos comes into advertising too. In a naive idealistic dream but we would like everything to be organic in terms of growth. We do have budget to invest but we're not motivated by greed &amp;  we're in it for the long haul. For the moment relying on forums, shares, social media ect to let people already in the know, know.
An ad campaign would most likely be used to target Bitcoin newbies &amp; the people who take it for granted the usual old way is still the only way. This may take a chunky budget at the moment lol
We know our system works well &amp; we're confident it can handle the traffic well but it depends on what you perceive as 'make it'. Sure we want the site popular and for it to help people and like most Bitcoiners, we're very very passionate about the potentional &amp; current implications on world economy but we're also humble in approach in that we don't have grand dreams of a millionaires lifestyle.
There's a minimum fee of 2 mBTC (0.002 BTC) or 2.55%, whichever is higher. We're sorry if it's in any way mis-leading, more info can be found here  
So in the $10 example, that listing would net around $0.85 on current exchange rates.
20% of profits go to the registered charity 'Not For Sale' and if ever in the position of having excess it would certainly be used for community based projects and not stashed in some off-shore account for a rainy day!
We'd love to see international trade on the site and for full categories across the board, this would achieve our perception of success as the more trade in de-centralized currency the better for every-one, eventually! :)
@_date: 2014-09-18 21:37:48
Easily! I'm not sure of the details but the pubs landlords happy to accept. He probably exchanges for GBP straight away and god knows about the tax but less than .1% of his custom  has any coins. He's just happy to be the first in the city to accept btc and the potential publicity it may bring.

@_date: 2014-05-24 15:56:37
Well said! I've noticed that on so many sites 'accepting' bitcoin that it a just a secondary means of payment and that it's value is always highlighted in comparison to the local fiat.
It says to me that if companies, people or whatever are obsessing about what btc is worth in their local fiat then they've missed the point somewhat or just don't understand the unlying protocol in bitcoin and the penny hasn't truly dropped in their minds yet.
We run a strictly bitcoin auction and marketplace which really couldn't give a toss about the 'worth' or 'value' of btc in dollars, euros, pounds or whatever, it's not that which gives btc it's value. It's the goods and services people are willing to exchange with and for, basically.
The penny will drop eventually and when it's does it'll drop hard.

Yes thought you meant the normal meaning, it's just one has to clarify these things sometimes ! Not happening on our site lol nothing illegal thanks. There are research chemicals that may be illegal in some countries but not others and a vendor selling these things knows that and won't normally deliver internationally.

Lol fair comment. Personally speaking, none us are designers par se so was fishing for suggestions on that. The other thing is we haven't advertised the site much either yet, have a budget for it but want it tip top before we do. We're getting 200 visitors a day roughly and 400 odd views from that. Had a few successful trades too so it's a confidence thing really

Doesn't really matter what btc against fiat is doing. Although it's important I think it's missing the point a little bit. The sooner we stop pricing goods and services in BTC according to what they're worth in local fiat, the better!
It's only because the two markets are merging that it seems to be so important at the moment...

Hey thanks for the response and sorry for the delay. All of that is amazing advice and we'll no doubt implement most of it. Including the multi sig wallet system. 
For now we will register ourselves as a charity so we're on the map in terms of legistration. This will no doubt help in terms of confidence. 
Security wise, we know nothing, and that means nothing is 100% safe if true hackers turn their attention to us and for the for-seeable time ahead, there will be a manual aspect to the withdrawals, it's always manned so no issues there.
Again thankyou so much for your time in repsonding, it really is very good advice and we really do take things seriously.

@_date: 2014-05-04 00:33:39
All deposits made go into a very secure wallet &amp; straight into an 
off-line address for cold storage, it's then represented virtually in mBTC as an account balance.
Escrow is made using the users virtual balance while the BTC is kept safe off-line.
Withdrawal requests use encrypted api commands to transfer back into the users wallet address.
Hope this explains your query.

It's nice to hear you concour. I'm sure 99% of crypto enthusiasts can see this but it's just so easy for us to get wrapped in the whole 'bubble' philosophy of getting rich quick, i.e bitcoin millionaire thing. This only really arises due to the current (fiat) market acceptance and default perception of value (£'s, $'s, €'s).
Fact is bitcoin on its own holds its own value in terms of usability, accesability, and cost of use. Add to that the very definition of value is something finite in supply, means that if you question fiat in its infinitely printable form then how the hell has that got value!
When this principle is in the driving seat of people's awarenesss then a bitcoin will become a bitcoin, and not whatever it's worth on a fiat exchange.

Don't forget the concept of the show was focussed on privacy not btc as obvious as that sounds. Given the gloomy portrayal of dark web bitcoin to quote "is no longer an underground phenomenon". Which is good imo.
The other thing was Julian Asange saying the universe fundamentally supports privacy! Can't really argue that can ya!?
@_date: 2014-05-25 10:55:45
My sentiments exactly. Although it's important so the two markets can work together, the general fixation on what BTC is worth compared to fiat is missing the point a little bit.
Something for a Bitcoin costs a Bitcoin, just so happens that's it's about £300 or something at the time.
I know the comparison is needed in people's minds until BTC is fully accepted but until then, it's worth being mindful that a Bitcoin is a Bitcoin. Just so happens to be worth something when bought or sold for another (fiat) currency...
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:07:39
It's a clever little bastard virus. I'm ok, not infected, nor, touch wood, will be as I'm hyper careful about what I click on or open in email. I read yesterday the virus has netted it's curators approx 10million in revenue and that even a police station in the US found their files encrypted and due to a back up error ended up paying the ransom.
Don't know how true that is but bloody hell, that must be satisfying for the scammers! Over 20,000 computers in Australia recently infected too lol SAVAGE!

Yes I agree! Not a maths fail though I assure you, more of a language hiccup. We're not going to do a NASA and use inches instead of centimeters any time soon! It's still embarrassing though, you wouldn't believe we're graduates sometimes and apologise profusely &amp; hope you don't boycott us because of it. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:06:04
Good idea and one we are considering. At the moment, a customer 'buys' credit with us with BTC and escrow uses the balance from that so no actual BTC is transfered until the balance is in the sellers account and withdrawn from there. Exactly the same as how BitMit used to work. 
Buyers and sellers can withdraw their balance when ever wanted or needed basically.
To build a bit of confidence. We would recommend buyers only buy credits to the amount of the item you're interested in. Always use escrow and obviously don't release it until ur happy. Buyers are in total control of that...
The balance only appears in the sellers account once released and won't be able to withdraw until then.
Hope this helps 😊

@_date: 2014-09-19 10:09:19
It's worthy of speculation though and although not in its current form, could be at some point; be of use. Sad to say that if AI was to be spawned it would be free of shitty attitudes that reduce the world to an angry or sarcastic point of view which constricts growth more than anything else on this planet. What's the point if people can't ask questions without ridicule. This (you) highlights the fact that humans aren't quite ready for AI to be of positive use yet and attitude play a much bigger role than some people realise! This is speculation and a catalyst for intelligent open discussion, not ridicule and crappy attitudes from people who are probably un happy in their life and feel the need to project it onto others.

Very interesting.

Thankyou! Well technically it's international but building it organically from the ground up means start local I guess. There's a translate function in the footer if English is a problem lol

I agree, I've always had the sentiment and have said on here before a bitcoin is a bitcoin is a bitcoin, it's the services and goods people are willing to exchange for btc that gives it value not the price in dollars or euros. It just happens to be at a stage now that we're so built on our native currencies we can't really think or see beyond this fact.
It'll change one day.

By spending it. Trade in bitcoin will increase demand

Try  we use Multi-Sig and provide a free escrow. Coins are never moved from one place to the other until withdrawn by the user providing a virtually 'trust-less' marketplace.

I hope openbizaar goes boom straight away it's the concept we've all been waiting for. Are there any speculations on the likely costs involved? And how user friendly will it be to the average Joe? Really hope it hits the ground running but, until then.... Lol

1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC. We think it makes it simpler...

100% concour. The attitude of buying and holding is totally understandable but at the same time, it's like self harming!

Selling unwanted items is a good way, try  for a safe and secure marketplace that uses Multi-Sig and provides a free escrow.

It should be Bitcoin accepts PayPal 😊

Indirectly. More trade/people using btc will push value compared to fiat up hense creating demand.
