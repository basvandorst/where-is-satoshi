I don't really care if advertisers want to sell me stuff. It just means I don't have to see ads I'm not interested in. Targeted advertising is way better than traditional advertising.

MSE is a great security software. And if you don't have Java installed, you're pretty much completely safe on Windows 7 or higher anyways.

Are you talking about HashTalk or @_date: 2015-01-20 20:43:06
I'm a grill btw
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:46:53
Yeah, it was total sarcasm. This subreddit is mostly a stupid circlejerk. I find myself getting most of my bitcoin news from because their perception isn't blurred by the dream of far off riches. Ironically, I had ~16BTC at my peak.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:43:47
Engadget isn't really the news. More of a blog.
@_date: 2015-01-01 13:35:07
Or Maybe Gox is just shit.
@_date: 2015-01-01 13:34:39
Only 1% of Gox missing coins were taken by hackers. This is a good thing.

Bitcoin is pretty cool, but I would argue that my Mastercard is more convenient. I can't say that Bitcoin has made every existing model obsolete.

Canada has more land than the US and China.

A more interesting measurement would be BTC to GDP
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:52:50
I agree with you there, but it's more than a penny stock. Penny stock companies actually have to operate. Bitcoins exist whether or not someone is operating them. Even if there value or utility drop to near zero, they will still exist, and therefore be unable to reach zero, ever.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:59:14
Very valid point.

For those who don't know, the National Post is one of Canada's most reputable newspapers (it's at least in the top three, with the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail).

Man, I wish pubs were that cheap were I lived...
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:07:34
I used to use CaVirtex, but libertybit.com is WAY better, and cheaper.
@_date: 2013-03-31 09:55:08
Interesting... How does performance and payout compare to BTCGuild? I have 4GHs mining on PPS with them. Is the p2pool as reliable and efficient a client? Can I set it to run automatically? Anything I need to know?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:54:56
SO BRAVE.
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:51:34
How do we really know ASICMiner isn't full of it? They may have a full operation going on, but for all we know it's a bunch of computers with 7870s.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:49:34
Don't know why you got downvoted. The BFL minirig is 30k and can only mine BTC at 1.5Gh/s, even though it's rated for 60...
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:02:09
What kind of profits do you make a day?
@_date: 2013-08-31 16:33:47
Hey, I'm still pissed at you for killing that Chinese student, you creepy Montrealer fuck!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:18:09
Haha, fair enough.
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:35:51
LobertyBit. Less volume, but bigger fluctuations and generally higher trade rates. Also, nice low 0.5% fees, and as a Canadian, convenient and cheap Interac banking transfers.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:51:41
This is the same circlejerk rhetoric that everyone in this thread has been saying. Nobody has made a comparison to the heavily underperforming BFL hardware.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:53:31
Are there any charted projections that you can show to prove this? Can anyone show me anything against this claim? I need some good evidence to make a well informed decision, fast.

Everyone here is talking about a crash?! I'm on MtGox and the price looks ok. What are you people talking about?
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:06:01
Kinda. I mean, basically, my get-rich-quick scheme turned into a long-term-investment-for-your-future scheme when the markets crashed. I'm still going to make money by mining and day-trading - it's now just going to take three or four times as long to recoup my costs and become cash flow positive.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:55:26
Yeah, I post a sell or buy request for x coins at x dollars, and when someone matches up, the sale is automatically executed and the balances of my accounts are adjusted accordingly. I've made 20-45% yesterday alone because of the volatility.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:29:12
Basically, yes.
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:15:39
I don't disagree. The currency is vulnerable, which is why I never actually bought bitcoins. I run a 4GHs mining operation, so my equipment is tangible. I can sell it pur repurpose it if it comes to that. Deprecation is not a huge concern. I figure worst case scenario I break even, or make less than anticipated.

400 years ago Canada was a bunch of stupid trees. Now we
re worth almost 1.8 trillion. Give that amount of time, and maybe.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:03:02
So, sell?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:59:48
Can you link me to some info about this? I still don't know why it dropped. Have an upvote as a token of my gratitude.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:03:14
Http://Libertybit.com is amazing, but most if the market is in CAD.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:02:37
Have you considered using CloudFlare for DDoS protection?
@_date: 2013-09-02 23:22:55
Clearly, it's not more stable - as you stated, BTC has had a higher change than INR.
@_date: 2013-07-02 11:56:32
How many gigs?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:46:45
Can someone tell me when the "return to normal" phase will be?
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:06:19
The cost can be easily amortized. I break even over the period of a year with my 5GH/s rig as long as bitcoins sell for over 12$, and that includes the cost of hydro.
The cost of mining is way over estimated.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:52:51
That is literally genius.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:48:30
Frankly, I'm not too scared. My only investment is the 5GH/s in video cards I bought, which is tangible, and can be resold. Power on the other hand...

They should use cloudflare.
