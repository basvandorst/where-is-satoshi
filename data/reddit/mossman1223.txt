GDAX is so far the only trading platform that will let me transfer fiat to and from my bank. Their interface is pretty smooth and is actually stable (contrast to Kraken, unusable at the moment).
If you trade on Coinbase yeah you kindof get shafted with high fees but trading fees on GDAX aren't bad at all.

I will take mild embarrassment over losing $1500, lol.
My advice to everyone is to use consistent organizational practices and make backups of everything.

This is wrong, however. The fan would be the first thing to go, if anything
