The basic idea is that more coins would be generated as more miners join the network.  There are at least three ways you could do this.  The first would be an [asymptotic function]( that approaches some predfined value.  The second would be to use a log function, which approaches infinity, but at an ever slower rate, meaning once moore's law was broken there would be a quasi hard limit on coin production. The third way would be to use a log function but put caps on coin production.  These caps, or even the predefined asymtotical limits, could also change over time just like bitcoin's block reward changes over time.
See for example:
y=500 is a steady coin production, like bitcoin, which started out y=50.
y=100x is a linear progression approaching infinity (which would probably be a bad idea)
y=arctan( 500*2 / pi ) is an asymptotical progression that approaches y=500.
Or a log function:
If you extend x to 150+ you can see how the log function goes over y=500, but at a slower and slower rate, meaning you could leave it uncaped and hope for moore's law to be broken, or you could still cap it yourself at y=500.

Yes, but this was largely offset by a huge explosion in population, leading to widespread malnutrition and a large working class that lived in poverty.


Living standards only started increasing *after* the industrial revolution (due to a phenomenon known as the [malthusian trap](  They declined quite dramatically during it (at least for average Joe) and reached a relative bottom during the first couple decades of the 1800s, perhaps an absolute bottom for *the entire history of all of human civilization*.  The average person living in Greece in 328 BC would have been about twice as well off as someone alive in 1800 in Britain.
Some economists look at increasing wages and conclude this was tightly correlated with living standards, but this is contradicted by declining *consumption* during this period, malnutrition, disease, and actual historical records that paint a population living largely in squalor.
 
The industrial revolution did pave the way for the increases in living conditions that we saw during the 19th century and into today (an escape from the malthusian trap) but most people were actually better off *before* the industrial revolution than during.

Why does everyone want to use mBTC?  If you've ever done microtransactions you'd already know how confusing mBTC and µBTC is.  10^-3 and 10^-6 get real cumbersome, real fast, they bounce right up against a bitcent, and they leave a trailing 10^2 satoshi at the end of a bitcoin just hanging there (which makes converting between BTC, mBTC, µBTC, bitcents and satoshi confusing because each one requires a different, uneven conversion ratio which doesn't follow any kind of pattern).
**This is because a bitcoin is currently divisible to 8 decimal places**
What we have right now is
    1.000,000,00
         介  介  
       mili/micro
With a lot of people using bitcent, which will probably be widely adopted eventually.
    1.00,0,000,00
       介 介  介  
    centi/mili/micro
What we need is a prefix at 10^-4 .  Computers in practice make extensive use of powers of 4 and 8.  The entire reason a satoshi is 10^-8 is because BTC internally is a 32 bit integer which takes up 10^8 decimal places.
A new prefix at 10^-4 would look like this and would be the equivilent of a *tera*bitcoin (if you want to call it that, I like bitcoin credit or bitcredit):
    1.0000,0000
         介
     new unit
The only reason we don't already use this is because SI doesn't have a standard 10^-4 prefix and therefore there's no easy name to fall back on.  If it did then this would have been a very obvious solution right from the start.
People could use "bitcent" without having it bump up against the next unit, we wouldn't have to joggle 3 or 4 different naming conventions for bitcoin, and we wouldn't have to deal with powers of 3 and 6 which divide a bitcoin unevenly (making it easy to be off a decimal place or two).  We'd just have the satioshi, and a new prefix dividing a bitcoin evenly into 2 sets of 4 decimal places, along with bitcents which would just be 100 of that unit, making conversions simple.

Yeah I guess not.  Assuming the ripe160(sha256()) function is a "perfect" hash the expect value (on a normal distribution) for the number of collisions we would expect to find would be 2^128 / 2^160.  Which is...extraordinarily small.  Meaning statistically there's probably not a single public address collision resulting from two different (valid) public keys.
Were the amount of entropy greater than 2^160 we would start to see collisions (even for a perfect hash).  Eg if there were 2^256 public keys there would be an average of 2^96 collisions, representing 37.5% of all public keys, reducing the amount of entropy to 2^160 (which I guess is obvious).
The limiting factor here is the ECDSA algorithm, which already reduces our search space, or entropy, to 2^128.

The broker takes the place of other traders, creating its own asks and bids.  This isn't completely uncommon, especially in futures, but on forex 99% of all asks and bids are put up by the broker.  It's the ultimate example of the big trader eating all the small traders.


It wasn't really.  The way forex brokers operate might actually be because of how liquid the market is but it's still very "scamy".  A US exchange for example might only have dollars in any significant volume, but all their clients think they're holding yen / euros.  They rely on either A) their clients not being allowed to withdrawal anything but dollars or B) they just assume none of their US clients want to withdrawal yen / euros in any significant volume.  The broker then just plays averages, meaning their clients will on average loose money and the broker will always come out ahead, just like a casino.

Duh I was being lazy cause I was calculating 50% first not 35% (diving by 2 each time).
At any rate even at .184% there's still a 31% chance over a 1 week period of forking the block chain.
And I think this should be larger.  Presumably there aren't any probability experts here, which isn't surprising, but the reason it's higher is because you don't have 24 tries in a day... you have almost as many tries as there are blocks (because all you need is to find the next 6 blocks *at any point*, not on the hour, which is where 31% comes from).  Over a 1 week period there are 1008 blocks mined giving you 1008 - 6 chances to mine 6 blocks in a row during that period (making it extremely likely to be successful).  I think the technical answer belongs to a poison distribution and I have a hunch the technically correct answer is 99.9%, ie almost guaranteed to happen.

In most countries bitcoin cant be criminalized without strong efforts from lobbyist groups.  Alternative currencies are not illegal and in fact [in the US alone there are hundreds of alternative currencies already in use]( many of which are backed by local banks and financial institutions.
What IS likely is companies like paypal or VISA attempting a 51% attack or blacklisting companies that accept bitcoin.  It's not the government you have to worry about, and probably not even large banks, the biggest threat to bitcoin will come from companies that specialize in payment processing (eg credit card companies, paypal etc).
Banks will be late to the game and the government will only get involved if/when their currencies start failing but if/when this happens we will have much bigger problems to worry about than bitcoin (you know the collapse of civilization and all that jazz).

Actually litecoin offers more security as a function of time but less security per confirmation.  Basically 1 LTC confirm (at 2.5 minutes) is less secure than 1 BTC confirm but 4 LTC confirms (= 10 minutes) is more secure than 1 BTC confirm.
See: 
As for ASICS, the reason it is ASICS resistant is because of the cost of memory.  For litecoin to be profitable for specialized ASICS hardware it would have to be worth significantly more than what bitcoin was when ASICS started showing up.
Also profit margin for buying ASICS over buying GPUs would be significantly less.  If you think of the cost of a GPU as being the cost of the processor + memory + extra stuff, a bitcoin ASICS is cheaper by a function of memory + extra stuff while a litecoin ASICS is cheaper only as a function of "extra stuff" (which is significantly less than what memory costs = orders of magnitude lower profit margin).

A "non-binding" bill just passed suggesting that ANR should in fact pay out its promised pensions to retired workers and it got passed almost unanimously.  4 people voted against the bill, all republicans, and a local news station's "in depth report" discovered that all 4 were either on the ANR/Massey Energy board of directors, were major share holders, or otherwise had their political campaigns financed by the company.

You can buy bitcoins with paypal using VirWoX.
Be careful if anyone offers you bitcoins via paypal.  People talk about buyers scamming sellers but there are far more sellers scamming buyers due to demand being in that direction.  Chargeback doesn't always work, unless you go all the way to your bank and convince them someone hacked your email or something, then paypal gets hit with the chargeback.  It's actually a lot easier to demand for paypal payment, never send the bitcoins, and just wait and see if the person you're scamming is proactive enough to head to his bank or convince paypal that someone hacked their email account.
That said VirWoX isn't scamming anyone, besides the ridiculous 12%+ fees they charge (lol).

I don't think we'll have hundreds of new cryptocurrencies popping up, not with any kind of value anyway.
LTC has a monopoly on [scrypt]( mining and BTC has one on hash based mining.
The only exception would be a proof of stake coin (like ppcoin) but so far it hasn't been proven if proof of stake is possible to fully decentralize.  I could see proof of stake beating out scrypt and hash *completely* given enough time (because it is technologically superior, in theory) but you can also have an infinite number of PoS coins because (AFAIK) your mining power cant monopolize it.  You'd have to rely solely on network effect (BTC and LTC dont need network effect as long as they're the first major coin for their particular mining algorithm).

It stores it in memory.  bitcoind runs as separate process from bitcoin-qt so there's no dedicated channel between the two.  The processes of unlocking bitcoind is calling `walletpassphrase` which by default unlocks your wallet indefinitely (until `walletlock` is called).
This means whenever you're running bitcoin-qt, second party applications (viruses) can access your wallet at the same time bitcoin-qt is.
If you run it headless it's even less secure because there's a longer period where the password is stored in memory.  This is probably why so many web services get hacked.  bitcoind needs an encrypted, dedicated link between itself and processes that connect to it.  Relying on API calls is incredibly insecure.  Even using `stdin` and `stdout` (piping) would be better.

They want everyone to sue people for polluting, thus creating an incentive for people to not pollute, which is actually how it worked for a really long time.  What they fail to do however is open up a damn history book and realize that this old way of handling pollution *did not work*.  Rivers used to literally catch on fire and every factory upstream would say "you can't prove it was our pollution that caused the river to catch on fire".  Same thing with pungent smells in the air.  Everyone knew exactly which factory was causing the air to stink but they'd just deny it and blame it on the other factories in the area.  And your drinking water would start tasting funny and catch on fire due to runoff from old coal mines that had been closed for years and therefore had nobody to even sue over the issue, which of course doesn't even touch how you'd *fix* such a problem with a free market solution ([this is an ongoing issue that is only solved by the EPA taking tax payer money and chemically altering the local water supply](

There is a very big difference here in that litecoin is a scypt currency and bitcoin is a hash currency.  Bitcoin miners can't mine litecoin and abuse their hashing power, at least not to any significant degree, and especially not with with ASICS specific bitcoin.  Nor can a pool decided to switch to litecoin because all their miners would also have to switch software or change their parameters to mine scypt.  They can however very easily disrupt and/or destroy other hashing currencies that they deem to be a threat to bitcoin.  A single bitcoin ASICS could mine terracoin for example and easily be 99% of terracoin's hashing power.
Likewise if another scypting currency comes along litecoin miners will be able to do the same thing.  There will be competing altchains but they'll be more akin to testnet than anything else.  Something fun to use and play around with that isn't really worth much.  Maybe a few small GPU miners will switch and sell their coins off to someone who wants to buy a few but in the end the effect it will have on bitcoin/litecoin will be minimal, and if anything will provide good use case scenarios for further bitcoin development
The only exception to this I can see is a proof of stake coin and it hasn't been proven yet whether or not proof of stake can be completely decentralized.  If that ever comes along we might see "bronze to litecoin's silver" but we're a long ways off from that.

I think normally bitcoins are stolen, and in Mt. Gox's case a bunch of emails and a small number of unsalted (but hashed) passwords were leaked.  Actually nobody lost any BTC during the Mt. Gox hack.  They caught it right away so it wasn't *that* big of a deal (as long as you don't mind getting a bunch of extra spam in your inbox).
In bitfloor's case if you had BTC in your account, after the hack there was a hold of just 1.7% of that.  I think the idea was after they had made up the stolen BTC you'd have 100% of your original amount.  See: [their oddly unupdated G+ post about it](
I'd say they're still "in debt" cause that was December of 2012 but I made an account after all that and have had zero problems with them.
Also their funding options give them zero access to your bank account, unless you enable ACH withdrawal (to your account) in which case if something happened and they tried to steal your money you could easily walk over to your bank and have the transaction reversed.  I'm pretty sure most places, with the exception of Coinbase, operate like this.

Note that this isn't checking the bitcoin address space it is only generating a single vanity address which is significantly less costly then checking for collisions.
You can also run your own math (say a billion keys/second) to "future proof" this scenario.  A 3 word brainwallet is currently impossible to crack but given enough time, and enough potential people doing it, a 3 word brainwallet is not future proof.  A 4 word brainwallet on the other hand has enough entropy to be secure from a brute force attack for at least a few hundred years, perhaps all of time.

No, not really.  Cannabis, and in particular un-pollinated smokeable cannabis, is notoriously difficult to grow.  Just about anything will kill it or otherwise make it unsmokeable.  Sativa does grow wild in some parts of the world (Mexico, India) where *it* is basically a weed but it doesn't grow (wild) in non-tropical climates.  Indica, which is believed to have been cultivated as hemp in central asia, will grow wild there but other temperate climates, like much of the US, aren't very suitable for it due to competition with other fauna.
This idea that it used to grow wild everywhere is a myth.  And even where it does grow wild you usually cant just pick it and start smoking it, you have to grow it yourself and tend to it every day of the grow season (and several times a day) for it to be viable.

You can only import the address in a non-deterministic manner.  Meaning you can use it with armoury but it wont be associated with your brain wallet recovery key.
Which means if you launched armoury on a brand new computer you'd have to do a hard import of your vanity address, so keep the private key somewhere safe.  Encrypted and stored on google drive / dropbox / a black CD somewhere seems like a decent idea.

The problem is most miners dont run bitcoind.  All you need is your miner and a pool.  Once you add bitcoind to the equation you have to download 6+ gigs of data and let it hog all your computer resources.  This will only get worse over time which is why a majority of miners will never use `getblocktemplate`.


How does this work with stratum?  All `getblocktemplate` does is give you the public address where the mined bitcoins and fees are sent to, everything else is presumably decided by you, meaning you can't use stratum with it (AFAIK).

There could have been a million reasons why they were indexed on google, not the least of which was the owners themselves posting their private links (maybe hoping someone would use them so they could steal their coins), googling their private links out of curiosity (which is a bad idea), or probably more likely is that every time google indexed the site it was generating its own address.

Actually there is a mining pool accepting CC and paypal for litecoin, on top of other established payment methods for LTC (liqpay, OKPAY, bitinstant).
I think your analogy is still correct, even if more and more bitinstants for litecoin start poping up, simply because the boundary is with fait.  LTC and BTC can be exchanged for each other fairly easily but fiat/LTC and fiat/BTC are huge hurdles.
Ie there is far more liquidity between BTC and LTC then there is between fiat and BTC/LTC.

Other federal taxes, however, are not, a fact you seem to refuse to even want to acknowledge:
Also see state taxes:
You're just selectively choosing statistics while I've maintained a single metric this whole time -- *all* taxes paid by individuals with regard to income.  Deceivingly, *parole tax* is a much larger portion of this than income tax, *by about 82%*, making federal income tax itself relatively unimportant.
The actual numbers for all taxes paid as a percentage of income, without dancing around and trying to wiggle your way out of it, are as follows:
* Top 1%: 19%
* Middle income: 33%
* Bottom 20%: 16.3%
The simple fact is, if you are wealthy, you pay significantly less in taxes than most people.  This is because you pay *capital gains* tax, not income tax, despite your income tax being theoretically higher.
And sure if you're really poor you also pay less in taxes but only marginally less -- about a 3% difference.

Contrary to what some people seem to believe there are "only" 2^160 possible bitcoin *addresses*.  It's true that there are approximately 2^256 possible bitcoin *private keys* but as a result there is on average 2^96 private keys per address.
The birthday problem at 2^160 however is a non issue.  At 100 billion bitcoin addresses the probability would be 1 in 2^160 / 100 * 10^9 which my calculator tells me is zero.  [Wolfram]( tells me the probability is about 7 * 10^-60 .
Also note that there are only ever going to be 21 million bitcoins and 21 million bitcoins scattered in 100 billion address is about 0.00021 BTC per address.  It would be much more profitable to just mine bitcoins instead of trying to brute force your way into an address that had coins.

You also quoted a bunch of really old standards that had known problems pretty much from day one (people were hashing dictionary files and finding collisions right away).
Even sha256 has a prime number preimage collision "flaw" that reduces its security by exactly 1 / 2.  This is mathematically proven, known even before it's release, meaning it's not a guess, we actually know enough about these ciphers nowadays to know exactly how strong they are as well as how weak they are.
Also this "weakness" doesn't effect bitcoin, for several reasons -- the address hash is ripe160(sha256(priv key)), on purpose in case one of the two get broken, the 2^128 complexity preimage attack is an example of finding an arbitrary collision, meaning you can't "choose" which collision you're looking for.  And at 2^128 complexity, a preimage attack isn't feasible, not now, not anytime in the future, you'd still have to break ripe160, being an arbitrary collision the birthday problem isn't relevant, and you'd still need the corresponding ECDSA keys in addition to the random collision you might (probably not) be able to find plus clever social engineering to actually take advantage of it.

People *are* free to use whatever money they want.  There's no law that you cant use other currency and in fact [there are over 100 in competition with the dollar inside US borders as we speak](
Central banking is an inevitable outcome of banking as a concept just like monopolies have a tendency to develop in other markets.  Some markets are more immune from monopolies than others but banking is a market that has a history of developing monopolies on its own (before the fed banking monopolies existed all over the country, state by state, as it's a local commodity, the same as water / electricity / roads etc).
The Fed is in fact a private company; it's not "chartered" by the US government.  The US government cant even issue its own currency, it issues t-bills which are bought by the Fed which the government then debits to mint dollars (meaning every dollar in circulation is "bought" through debt).  The Fed has no obligation to buy t-bills there's just kind of an understanding between the two that the Fed has to help buy US debt.  Technically, as a private company, they can refuse.

ECDSA is a signing algorithm which allows a person with a private key to sign a message associated with a private/public key pair, allowing anyone with the public key to verify that the message was signed with its associated private key (see: [public key cryptography](  When you send bitcoins what you're really doing is signing a message that says "I want to send N BTC to address Y" and everyone can easily verify not only the authenticity of the message but also what address it hashes to.
A bitcoin address, internally, is simply a hash of a public key, specifically ripe160(sha256(pubKey)).  With a few exceptions almost any 160 bit integer is a valid bitcoin address but only a subset of those addresses can ever have valid public/private keys associated with them.  You can't know ahead of time which address those are, but in theory there are about 2^160 - 2^128 valid addresses that can never have keys associated with them and therefore coins sent there can never be spent, not because guessing the private key would be insanely difficulty but because, even in theory, the private key for that address does not exist.
In my first post I actually did the math wrong but wolframalpha tells me [99.999999%]( of valid address can never have keys associated them.  This is because 2^160 is exponentially larger than 2^128 .
Note that the addresses we see are base58 encoded address of the 160 bit internal address, plus a 4 byte base58 encoded checksum.  This is why a typo will almost always result in an invalid address.  The only valid "human readable" addresses are those which have valid checksums (specially 1/2^(4 * 8) or 1 in 4294967296 typos will be a valid bitcoin address).  You can easily test this yourself by changing a digit of an address on blockchain.info .
Visually the entire process is,
    private key -&gt; public key -&gt; public address -&gt; base58 human readable address and checksum

Do they have an hp/torque vs rpm graph anywhere?
0 to 60 in 5 seconds is pretty damn good especially considering what kind of gas mileage (109 / gallon) it gets.
That compares with the BRZ / FR-S but with 3 times the fuel efficiency (the BRZ / FR-S actually has amazing gas mileage for it being a sports car).  They also cost the same ($25,000) but the WIKISPEED SGT01 doesn't really have an interior, or a (decent) suspension, or really hardly anything else AFAIK.  According to this [youtube video]( the car's performance and mpg rating is entirely a function of how light the car is, not how efficient the engine is, and according to their website you really don't want to be driving it in the rain or snow.
This almost seems like a gimmick to me.  Everyone knows you can get fuel efficient vehicles just by building them super lightweight but nobody ever does it because the results of such a vehicle are exactly what you see here -- rattly, awful traction, no interior, lacks functionality for day to day driving, and is downright ugly.
Granted they say it's a hobby but I dont see their cars ever really improving beyond what they already have so I don't really see this being a viable, consumer level car (unfortunately).

The problem with using SI units is it divides a bitcoin into uneven pieces.
The guy who runs causicius coins and a few others seem to think 10^-4 is a good place for a new "standard" unit.  SI is self-limiting and there's no reason bitcoin should be crippled by forcing SI onto it.
Computers make use of 10^4 and 10^-4 extensively and being that a BTC is divisible all the way to 10^-8 , 10^-4 is probably the best prefix for it.

You cant trade directly on an exchange unless your have billions of dollars to fork out.  The stock market and Mt. Gox are fundamentally different, in that **the stock market is completely offline**.  You cannot compare the two.  The closest link between the two are onling brokers which is why I was comparing them.  Can you imagine what would happen if the stock market were online?  It would crash every other day.  No way they would be able to keep it up.


I don't think you understand how their service works.  You sign up for a certain tier account that you pay for in fees.  If you don't make enough trades to cover the amount in fees they want from you then they bill you the difference (no joke, basic account is like 100 trades / month, if you do 10 trades in a month they either close down you account, taking all your shares / money, or they charge for the other 90 trades).
It's very scamy the way its set up but all of this information is the link I gave you, in plain English, *that you have chosen to ignore*.  Read down past where they say it's "free for pro elite customers", where they explain exactly how it is you become a "pro elite customer", which is, of course, $$$$.  **Dancing around this fact is plain dishonest.**  Either you're purposefully lying to me or you just glanced at the link for 1 second, saw the word "free", and then jumped to your own conclusions about it.


So you use an old fashioned broker that takes 1 to 2 days to complete a trade?  How does that "experience" (assuming you're not bullshiting me) have any relevance with what we're talking about?  Your broker doesn't have real time quotes either.  Hell he might not even know what a particular stock opened at on any given day.  During the 90s anyway the most they would tell you is what a particular stock closed at the day before.  Granted they probably pay for subscription services nowadays but they would pay for those subscription services with the $20 / month fee they bill you and everyone else, so it's not like it's free in either case for anyone that's involved.

FYI bitfloor was down almost all day yesterday and BTC-E wasn't doing too great either (even when they were up their order book was ALWAYS out of date, with zero indication of this fact).
I'm not too sure about the others cause I wans't trading (a bad idea normally during a crash like that) but it's not like all the other exchanges are up and 100% responsive while Mt. Gox was lagging by 30 minutes.  Mt. Gox is the only exchange that actually handles lag and tells you about it, in real time.  With all the other exchanges you're just flying blind and waiting for a webpage to maybe load and maybe allow you to trade for 5 seconds.
The way I see it people are mad at Mt. Gox for being [the bearer of bad news](  They watched a $100 dollar runup in a period of like 2 days come crashing down around them and instead of blaming the market for being stupid and causing that kind of irrational growth they want to believe that Mt. Gox is 100% responsible for the crash and if it weren't for Mt. Gox their hoard of coins would be worth $350 by now.  Maybe Mt. Gox's twitter / facebook updates aren't the most assuring but just remember that they were up yesterday while all the other exchanges were out cold.
Also a lot of the sites you listed either have to use Mt. Gox for unrelated / technical reasons (bitcoincharts) or have options for others (bitcoinity).

No, I'm sorry if you didn't understand what I posted but I was talking about the metric system which has no 10^-4 prefix (which is common in computers and binary but not so much in civil engineering).  Bitcoin needs a unit as a 10^-4 prefix, not 10^-2/ 10^3 / 10^6.  These break up a bitcoin into awful places but people have been using them because that's the old standard that everyone uses and nobody stops to think that maybe there's a better, more sensible alternative.

The difference here is the profit margin for buying a litecoin ASICS versus buying another GPU is much smaller than bitcoin.
A litecoin ASICS is going to be almost identical to a GPU except striped of a little extra stuff.  A bitcoin ASICS is likewise very similar to a GPU, striped of a litle extra stuff, but also striped of the memory that you commonly find on GPUs.  This makes them *a lot* cheaper than GPUs meaning if you want to invest in hardware to mine bitcoin you'll have to buy an ASICS whereas if you want to invest in hardware to mine litecoin, even which ASICS come around, it's possible you'll always be able to find a GPU somewhere that is competitive.

You need a way to convert a private key to a public address. There are utilities that will do this.
 (Bitcoin Off The Grid)
For example
echo -n "Satoshi Nakamoto" | sha256sum | ./keyfmt 'Address: %a
Privkey: %w'
Another utility you might find useful is [blockparser]( which can get a list of addresses that have been used on the blockchain. Alternatively you could query
Or do something like this:
GET " | grep "Never used on the network"
For what it's worth I think this "challenge" is old, tried, and stupid but I guess this is new for a lot of bitcoin users. If you want a secure brain wallet using sha256 just add a salt and hash it some arbitrary number of times (like if you were born in 1987 hash it 1987 times).

I'd assume it to be a normal distribution which means statistically you'd start running into collisions at a 2^n/2 search space or 2^160/2 = 2^80 .  2^80 is considered a "safe" amount of entropy, indefinitely, from all future hardware based attacks, which is why the standard ripe protocol is ripe-160.
If there were a 2^256 search space then you would [*expect*]( to see, on average μ = 2^256 / 2^160 = 2^96 collisions, which represents 37.5% of all public keys.


The thing with ECDSA is there are 2^256 valid private keys but only 2^128 valid public keys.  That means every public key has, on average, two valid private keys.  Not only that, you can statistically "guess" where the collisions are based on fancy ECDSA math, limiting your search space to about 2^128 , in theory.


No we're assuming an attacker has generated all 2^128 public keys, representing 100% of all valid public addresses, give or take 5% or 10% (the birthday problem makes it relevant even at 50%).
Note that there are 2^160 possible "bitcoin addresses" but only 2^128 of those addresses are valid, meaning there are a significant number of bitcoin addresses (2^32 ) which cannot ever have an associated private/public key pair.  These invalid addresses can carry bitcoin balances but bitcoins sent to those addresses can never be redeemed.

Personally I think double spaced sentences look better.  The only reason you'd want to single space is if you're lazy, which is what the whole typewriter business during the 50s seems to be about.  
If you single space sentences the same as other punctuations then the end of a sentence looks no different from the end of an abbreviation / acronym etc.
On a computer you have less of a reason to be lazy about double spacing sentences because keyboards are a hell of a lot easier to type on than old typewriters were.

Suddenly gold or silver and their exchange in terms of each other (gold / silver exchange rate) are changing dramatically and this either causes these periods of depression or makes them worse.  This is a recurrent theme for the entire century.

Actually even when you include the great depression and the recent financial collapse, the past 100 years have been amazingly stable compared to the 100 years before that.  In actuality, we used to have great depression like events every 15-30 years, as parent was alluding to.  We've had maybe one and a half such events now in the past *100* years and during the same period have sustained significantly more growth.
And for the record, [robber barons]( very much loved the 1800s so it's not like the global illuminati prefers one model over the other.

Specifics about the size of the attack are unclear but it's certainly a very persistent attack, having been ongoing for a very long time and beyond the capabilities of both prolexic and cloudfair, combined, to be able to handle.
If the NYSE and large brokers like E*Trade have these kinds of problems why are you so quick to blame it on Mt. Gox and pretend like these other companies, who have had worse problems than Mt. Gox in the past (and continue to "suffer" from 20+ minute lag), have fundamentally better infrastructure because...you just know, because you're a self-proclaimed expert who doesn't even understand how the NYSE operates.

It could relate to how people perceive the economy.  A lot of people, myself included, bought bitcoins as a hedge against stuff happening in the real world.  As the economy picks up and things seem less grim there might be fewer people buying bitcoins for that reason.
So it's not that the dollar index is related to bitcoin directly, there's a third variable that relates both together.  When the next recession hits, people will start buying bitcoins AND the dollar index will start declining again, as a related variable, but not a causative relationship.  I wouldn't put all my money on that relationship -- it's probably just 1 of many reasons people buy / sell bitcoins -- but there is probably something to it.  Gold is certainly affected and people often compare bitcoin to gold as a store of value.

 bitcoind API will send out transactions without needing the password.**
Verify this yourself if you want but it's 100% true.  I've *always* had a problem with the way that worked.  It was not built to be an everyday wallet it was built to run in the background and let other application connect to it (like a web service) and as a result is not very secure on a desktop machine.  `bitcoind sendtoaddress 1XXX 2BTC` no password, no need even for rpc, just run that command as the user that launched bitcoind and it will send out 2BTC no questions asked.  Even if bitcoind isn't running you can still do this (just launch bitcoind first and wait for it to sync, it wont ask for your password even if you start it cold like that, the only time it will ask for your password is when the keypool runs out).

This is just a wild guess but lets say it's true that criminal organizations are using gold for whatever reasons.  Maybe government agencies tasked with tracking gang activity would like to know how they operate and, gold being a part of that operation, ends up getting included in their reports.
Just a wild guess.  
Of course maybe there is actually a huge conspiracy deep inside the inner workings of the government, completely hidden from us (except for the stuff truthers somehow manage to find), orchestrated between disconnected agencies and branches of government by a select few elite individuals and said individuals are now slowly pushing for the criminalisation of gold.  Both are equally likely scenarios, right?

*bitcoind* stores your password.  bitcoin-qt is just a frontend to bitcoind.  The exploit exists because bitcoind doesn't ask for a password every time you go to do something.  It only needs the password to put it in an unlocked state, during which time any program or malicious software can request a `sendtoaddress`, not just the original program that sent the password, which in this case would be bitcoin-qt.
Really there should be a piping interface and the API should be turned off by default.  That alone would make it 100 times more secure.  The API is only there for web applications and that's why bitcoind is so vulnerable to this kind of attack (and why websites continue being hacked).

Basically the number of wins you need to make a fixed amount of money goes up while at the same time your risk for each individual bet goes down (this per-bet risk then is multiplied by how many bets you need to win).   It just takes you longer to either make your money or go bankrupt.  In a sense you almost guarantee a loss and decrease the chance you might get lucky and "beat the odds" because your averages (which are against you) are allowed to play out a larger number of times.
Interestingly if you bet half of your target for a single round your chances of "beating the odds" are greater (by 20%~25%) then doing a bunch of smaller bets using the martingale system.

Not necessarily.  It reduces confidence in bitcoin and bitcoin venders, requiring longer conformation time and increased fees due to the need for 3rd party payment processors.  In the long run it is against your self-interest to abuse the system, in theory anyway, assuming everyone else was a [rational agent](  Sense we've already established that *people are not rational* this is a moot point.


[Fully rational individuals would not be assholes](


That's a touchy subject, defining something as *immoral*, but generally lying/cheating/stealing fall in this category.


I would probably feel bad for whoever lost it but from a practical standpoint it's not like you can go around looking for whoever dropped it.  Granted depending on the country you could leave $100 laying around and nobody will bother it, meaning the owner could go back and claim it, and people would assume that whoever picked it up lost it earlier.  Japan for example is like this so if you asked the same question to someone from Japan they would give you a completely different answer.
Granted this isn't anywhere close to being a good analogy in the first place.  A better analogy would be seeing someone's door unlocked, knowing full well who lived there, and taking advantage of them leaving their door unlocked by stealing all their valuables from their home.  Some other asshole/thief would probably do the same thing so why shouldn't you take advantage of the situation?  It's not like we blame assholes and thieves for their behavior so surely noone would ever blame you, right?
Hackers used to argue the "morals" of taking advantage of security flaws and comparing it to someone leaving their door/window open but lots of people also argued the point that people should just lock their doors and its their own fault if they don't, removing any and all blame from a hacker or thief.  The later have slowly given up trying to argue their case because it's obvious who is correct.

I can only assume that Silicon Valley Bank would object to this measure.  It's not like everyone is in legue behind closed doors to shut down bitcoin.  The entire banking industry would be upset if this ever happened and such a move could potentially spark bank runs throughout the US.  Not saying such a thing could never happen (see: Cyprus) but lets not assume that everyone's interests are identical here; there would be a lot of conflict between the different interests of banks, investors, congress, the courts etc. 
FinCIN isn't even the US government; it's just a random agency that thinks it has more power than its actually been given.  They could cause a temporary bitcoin "shock" if they tried to seize bank assets but such a move would be challenged in courts and only legal if congress went through a lengthy process to pass a bill to shut down bitcoin, which would be highly publicized and likely to fail.

Ipods are the ones that skipped.  They were in fact known for that (and I should know cause I had one at the time and ran cross country).  I owned two MP3 players before that one and continued using them instead of my new ipod (which actually broke after maybe 3 months anyway).  They were heavy, they skipped, they only supported one or two file types (no FLAC support), they were notoriously fragile, would break for literally no reason at all, and only had maybe 4 hours of real world battery life.  Solid state MP3 players is where the market has always been.  That was the ZUNE's downfall as well (Microsoft followed Apple's strategy, and were successful for similar reasons).
Apple jumped for a 10GB model because people didn't understand what megabytes and gigabytes were.  An uninformed customer would look for the best, so they'd ask a sales rep for the "biggest", and that was one of maybe three models in stock, one being the ipod 10GB.
And yes there were literally *hundreds* of better products on the market.  Nobody needed 10GB in a MP3 player back then (a 3 minute MP3 was usually 90 KB at the time) and even if you did need 10GB any of the other models would have outperformed an ipod.

"gambling enterprise costs “taxpayers $3 for every $1 of state revenue collected.”"
"A Creigton University study found that counties with casinos soon have double the bankruptcy rates of counties without casinos"

The barrier of entry is how difficult it is to attain bitcoins; you go through a lot of trouble to get a few then you don't want to spend them.  I guess one way to do it would be next time you plan to buy bitcoins, look around a couple shops, see if you want anything, and if you do add an equivalent dollar amount to your order specifically to spend there (or just buy a few extra bitcoins for future purchases knowing there are places out there to spend them).

The fallacy here is assuming that the only kind of tax levied by the US government is a federal income tax.  A fact you seemed well aware of initially but subsequently ignored, twice, presumably because these facts otherwise show your argument to be incorrect.

When you take into consideration *all* taxes, and not just income taxes, rich people pay significantly less (19%) of their overall income than the middle class (33%).  For the sake of completion: the poorest of americans pay 12.3% of their income in state and local taxes and 4% of their income in federal taxes (that's 16.3% total).

Faster transaction time and less variance finding blocks.
It's not uncommon to wait 30+ minutes for a new block with bitcoin and 1.5 hours for 6 confirms.  If you're lucky maybe 5 minutes for three blocks all of the sudden and 30 minutes for 6 confirms.
10 minute block creation is only an average and the variance, especially recently, has been quite large, meaning you don't know if you'll have to wait 30 minutes or 1 and a half hours for your funds to be credited to you.
In litecoin the same variance would result in in a 7.5~22.5 minute wait.  It's not that it's faster it's that it's more predictable.  If we move payment into the real world with cell phones and ATM machines you can send funds faster and be guaranteed to have been credited within 20 minutes.  Even if you wait for 3 confirms with bitcoin you still don't know if you're going to be waiting half an hour or 60+ minutes which is hugely incontinent, not necessarily because it takes longer, but because you cant plan for it.

I like the word credits.
10,000 satoshi could be a bitcredit for example.
I think four zeros is a good place for a standard unit (as opposed to 3 and 6) because 1 bitcoin is made of 8 decimal places of satoshi.  4 decimal places therefore is easy to see.
The standard way to divide a bitcoin right now is mili / micro BTC which looks like this:
    1.000,000,00 (notice the trailing two digits)
vs a single divider at 4 zeros:
    1.0000,0000
I already tend to think in terms of 10,000 satoshi for microtransactions right now anyway (it's basically 1/100th of a bitcent) which makes it really hard to mess up and be off a digit (seeing two groups of 4 digits is much easier for your brain to process than seeing two groups of 3 and one group of 2).

Actually VirWox will let you deposit with paypal/credit card and convert first to SLL then to bitcoin.  No secondlife account required.
They charge fairly high commission however and you have to buy whole bitcoins.  I've watched them increase their USD deposit limit as BTC has become more expensive and from what I can tell you need very close to the maximum daily transfer to be able to buy 2 BTC.
For reference, because they wont tell you this on their site until after you have funds deposited (and SLL in your account), you need ~16,096.23 SLL (~$71.42 + paypal fee) for 2 BTC and ~8,073.11 (~$36.29 + paypal fee) for 1BTC.
You will have to wait 48 hours before you can withdrawal and they'll charge .02 BTC in the process.  *Buy all your SLL at once and make sure you have enough because if you buy in smaller quantities it costs more.*  You will have SLL/USD "change" left over.
Bitinstant is cheaper and IMO more convenient because you get exact change.  You do however have to drive out to either a bank, which is the cheapest IIRC, or a moneygram location (should be plenty close by -- CVS, walmart etc), which charges ~$4 on top of your order but is still a lot cheaper than VirWox.  You need cash for this method.

Gold reserves were being quickly depleted and sent over to Japan etc, so rapidly that we would have been bankrupt in less than a couple years and some people (see: statisticians in Germany) question if we have even half of our currently stated reserves.


If the entire world is off a gold standard then any single nation on a gold standard will very quickly fail and become uncompetitive.  I would not be against a gold standard, or a non-inflationary currency, sans potential problems it *might* cause, but it's a long shot from holding a certain political position and believing in wild conspiracy theories (while often being oblivious of actual economics besides 'teh gobment is evil and robs us').
People read that Reagan made Americans poorer by taking us off the gold standard so they have a nee-jerk "not fair" emotional reaction while failing to realize that we would have been bankrupt *within the decade* had this action not been taken.  Sure Japanese cars and electronics got much more expensive but that had the immediate effect of making local companies more competitive (not that it mattered much, people continued buying Japanese goods at higher prices because American companies suck at making cars and consumer electronics).

You've provided absolutely no reason why this might be true.  I would however love to hear your logic here.
The deflationary nature of bitcoin helps store wealth but I see no reason why this specifically would "level the playing filed" by any substantial degree.  The biggest problem is stagnant wages that have remained flat while worker production, corporate profits and income to the top 1% has increased dramatically, along with a declining tax on the wealthy that has gone from 50%+ to 15% (while taxes on the working class remain at 33%).  This is mostly a function of the free market as most middle class workers have enough to not actively demand higher wages like what we saw through most of the first half of the 20th century with unions and stuff like that but the other part is an unfair tax code favoring the wealthy, neither of which would be "fixed" by bitcoin.

They might blacklist merchants who accept bitcoin or launch a 51% attack but it's very unlikely there will ever be legal intervention (it will just be a pissing match all over the free market, and the leverage that paypal/visa have does pose a serious threat to bitcoin's long-term survivability).

Um... no.  The broker normally puts up orders *for other people*.  In this case the broker is putting up his own orders on behalf of the house (again this isn't completely uncommon, at least not in futures, but this is a scenario where sometimes 100% of the orders available to you are put up by the broker, for himself, and not for other people).


Which means you're not touching the real forex market.  Your trades never go out into the real world.  It's all 100% virtual against the broker.


To make more money.  It's cheaper to just let people play the house instead of making real orders, which would cost the broker money, forcing them to charge higher fees then all of the competition.  If you want to trade actual forex without playing a silly game against the "broker" it costs you *a lot* of money.

I'm pretty sure language, and English in particular, is inherently ambiguous.
And yes according to styling guidelines that advocate the use of "a, b and c", most state to use "a, b, and c" in cases where it might be ambiguous.
Ie see the excerpts from here:
The reason I can see using "a, b and c" over "a, b, and c", especially in cases where it isn't ambiguous, is because that last comma adds a break in the sentence, a short pause, and takes longer to read.  The "a, b and c" syntax is brisker and much faster to read.

I met a group of homeless people a few years ago, around 7 or 8 PM, who were specifically looking to buy alcohol for the night.  I gave them money anyway, partly cause they all looked to be friends and I thought it was kind of funny.  They were celebrating something so it didn't seem like they bought alcohol often.  Either way they're homeless, maybe they shouldn't be drinking, but who am I to judge?  If I had that kind of shitty life I'd probably drink as well.

Anyone using bitcoin should know it's growing, there's still a hardfork in the future, and probably a few more bugs down the road.  It's inevitable and I think the fact that a bug this large was remedied in such a short period of time proves that these bugs, and the upcoming hardfork, will be relatively painless.
Plus it's had the effect of scaring the price down which can only be a good thing.  The faster prices skyrocket, the more volatility merchants have to put up and more likely it is that a bubble is growing.  Hopefully a bunch of speculators had their bots trip their stop-loss orders, incurring losses for market manipulators and people here only to make a few bucks, leaving the price more reflective of bitcoin's *actual* value.

I am aware of two brainwallets that currently have coins in them.  They've had coins sense way before this "challenge", which is nothing new (see bitcointalk where this has been done a million times already).
I'm thoroughly surprised nobody emptied those wallets.  In fact I wouldn't be surprised if the entire thing was a hoax.  At least one of his challenges was computationally impossible so he had to create an alt to "claim" the coins otherwise nobody would have found it.  The others I could easily see being brute forced but anyone who had successfully brute forced those wallets would have stumbled on the other two, much older brain wallets in the process, which still contain coins.
I really want to call bullshit on this guy but I don't want to bring him any more attention then he's already gotten.

It does take a little bit of perspective to understand.  The average college educated American makes something like $4 million over their lifetime, but a lot of that $4 million gets eaten by interest and is otherwise a lost opportunity (going towards living expenses instead of being invested).
If, at any point, someone is able to come up with $100,000, they are actually a lot better off than you'd think in the grand scheme of things.  Sure some people will waste it, and it doesn't exactly make you rich, but it does put you ahead of the game. Because so many things are denominated in interest, either in the form of debt (car payments, mortgage etc) or the form of savings (your children's college fund, retirement etc), being able to tip yourself completely in the positive has a very large long-term effect due to the nature of compound interest, which now works 100% for you instead of being mostly against you.

I really doubt the purpose of this was to educate potential "imbeciles".  Maybe you could go through his blog and figure out what his purpose actually was (I don't think he had one) but it certainly wasn't educational.  It was a programming challenge, a challenge that's already been done a million times, and to me the entire thing seemed stupid.


How do you gather?  My small dictionary (/usr/share/dict/words) has 479829 words.  That's 479829^4 or 53008555485158849916081 bits of entropy.  Note that character entropy, even at a conservative estimate, is significantly larger -- (26+1)^(7*4+3).  Neither case considers capital letters
Vanitygen on the best current hardware (an AMD GPU) can hash 26 million addresses a second.  It's not checking addresses or doing anything sophisticated with the block chain, it's just generating them, for vanity purposes.  So lets say we can generate a billion addresses a second, *and* check them.  Impossible, yes, even well into the future, but for the sake of argument:
479829^4 / 1000000000÷60÷60÷24 = 613524947 days or 1680890 years.
Btw I've gone through all single word brain wallets for a much larger dictionary (650k words) and like I said there are two "brain wallets" at the moment with coins in them but I can only imagine they were put there on purpose.  Hacking a two word brain wallet would take on the order of 10 to 100 years, even if I rewrote my code to be significantly faster, so I've obviously never attempted it but I imagine there are probably a couple out there.  The fact that these other brain wallets weren't hacked during this contest makes me suspicious that the whole thing was a hoax, cause they would have been found in the process (in theory) had it not been a hoax.

I don't understand how it was bad publicity.  It wasn't a glorifying review about how bitcoin is going to take over the world; it was an honest, slightly comical, *down to earth* look about what I thought were fairly objective facts about the coin.
Sure they insinuated all you could do is buy drugs with it and didn't mention the larger economy (or even gambling, which is 50%+ of the economy), but it really wasn't very bad or even necessarily dishonest.  Plus they didn't talk about the million hacks that have occurred in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Even though bitcoin was never hacked, combine the words "hacked" and "bitcoin" in the same sentence and I guarantee his audience will associate the two without understanding the difference (point is: the whole thing could have been worse).

You're confusing the private key of an address and electrum's root key, which generates all the addresses and private keys.
If disclosing the private key of one of your addresses somehow compromises the root key, or allows you to generate new private keys based on a flaw in the algorithm, this information is brand new to me, and you'll have to expand on that.

Actually where I live roads are usually built / maintained by the DOT (with state and federal money).
There are a couple private companies that they contract out to occasionally and you can always tell it's them because of the huge white trucks they use, the fact that they take forever, and then the roads afterwards always look (and drive) like shit.
My state might be the exception to the rule but DOT workers do a lot better job maintaining the roads than the private contracting companies.

BTC-E is full of bears anyway.  If money were easier to get into the exchange, and the operators more reliable/trustworthy, people would arbitrage the hell out of it but the only people who know how to get money in (and actually trust the exchange) are bearish anyway and rarely do arbitrage.

Were you the guy selling 10 BTC recently?  I placed a bid, right at what it would have cost me on virwox, and I wouldn't have scammed you :)
The opposite also happens just so you know.  If you get a really good deal for a bitcoin (against the mt gox rate) don't be surprised if the other guy cancels your deal and realists hopping for a higher price.  And by good deal I mean anything not 20% above market price (I had a deal at like 5% above market price that got canceled after 7 days, and the guy even tried to keep my money after that).
If you want to paypal -&gt; BTC use virwox.  If you want to sell BTC above market price on ebay just sell small amounts over time and hope nobody scams you.  Or use bitmit.  People sell cash and other stuff above market price cause they want the bitcoins.

That's not the way they're run in practice.  You're promised that you're getting a good deal on some product and will be able to sell it to other people and that Bob here is making a lot of money because he's a supplier and sells bulk to people he referred under him which is why you should get all your friends to help you also.  You have friends?  Good, buy a little extra, you'll get a better deal and don't worry about selling it because you can sell your bulk product to your friends and they'll get rich also by doing the same thing.
That or they work on referrals, everyone buys from a central supplier, but you get paid a percentage of proceeds from people you referred, the people they referred, and so on.  This is really common online and also for the "get rich quick" schemes / "work from home" / "be your own boss" businesses advertised on TV, both of which are usually illegal (but obscurificated through fancy legal frameworks).
Watch a documentary about multi level marketing and how it works.  Even the article you linked has a section talking about the US government investigating a bunch of MLM companies right now as being pyramid schemes and the FTC warning consumers not to get involved with them especially if you get payed for referring other people (which is the cornerstone of what a pyramid scheme is).

Once you run `walletpassphrase`, bitcoind will process any `sendtoaddress` calls without needing the password, *indefinitely*, until you call `walletlock`.  As a security measure you can call `walletpassphrase` and give it a number of seconds to remain open but that's more of a fail-safe mechanism and not something you're meant to rely on (you're supposed to call `walletlock` once you're done).
There is no need to read the passphrase from memory because bitcoind will actually do all the work for you.


If you're runing bitcoin-qt I have a hunch this is correct.  A malicious program would have to wait for you to sent a transaction and then send its own transaction during the time that bitcoind is unlocked (which might be quick for a human but I doubt a computer program would have any trouble sending its API call in time).


As long as you called `walletlock` before shutting it down the last time.  It will actually start unlocked without ever needing a password if you left it unlocked last time.

It used to be you could get a CD with 8%, 11%+ interest.  That's how people used to save to buy a house or a car.  The economy used to work in the interests of normal people when saving was encouraged and you could work for a living.  It's how normal, average people used to get ahead in life.
Then the 80s happened, labor was devalued, saving discouraged, and we have these people in the financial industry stealing billions of dollars out of everyone's 401ks.
The only reason you see a need to "invest" your money is because of the shenanigans that have happened ever sense the 80s.  We need a fundamental paradigm shift to fix everything so that people dont have to risk their hard earned money is the stock market, or in gold, or wherever else just so they can (god forbid) get ahead in life.

The innovating thing about bitcoin is a central ledger (a block) and a mechanism (mining) that can prevent people from double spending or from claiming that they have coins that don't exist.
The idea of having a p2p currency is quite old and not that novel of a concept, very easy to do, but the flaw with early p2p cryptocoins was that once you took out the middle man (a central database controlled by a central authority) it became very easy to game.  Bitcoin was the first cryoptocurrency to figure out a way to prevent fraud without relying on any kind of central database.

Granted it's not from lack of features; [campbx]( has a lot going on for them as an exchange, besides having next to no liquidity, so by all means check them out instead of just defaulting to the  or  exchanges (who are no better than Mt. Gox from what I can tell).
*Edit --* And as I post this the site (campbx) goes "503 service unavailable" wtf.
*Edit 2 --* The same thing happened to the NYSE during the 1999 tech bubble.  Everyone sold all at once and the exchanges basically went down.  You're trying to blame Mt. Gox cause your bitcoins are suddenly worth less but the lag on Mt. Gox is the result of a bubble (or a mini-bubble) popping all at once.  Don't pretend your bitcoins would be worth $350 if it weren't for Mt. Gox.

You can export your private key from your wallet for the 1KtjYSKaCXcKuVW3yQYC56SgRt9cmmf3BT address and then resend funds from there back to the address you want them in.  It'll let you fine tune everything.
I use that site because you can specify multiple outputs and see the size of your transaction ahead of time (to set your fee).  Otherwise I use electrum as my desktop client because it's convenient.
Also whatever funds you have left over in an address after a transaction will stay in that address (unlike what someone else said here).  The "change" is a separate output that goes back to your address as a new input.  Technically if you dont have that last output it will get mined as a fee but brainwallet.org will automatically create it for you.

If you sign up for a forex trading site 99% of the time you'll actually be making trades against the exchange and not other traders.  If you buy yen for example the exchange doesn't go buy yen for you, nor does it back your yen holdings against deposits by its other customers, instead it's completely virtual and never touches the real market.
Then they give you huge margin to play with, illegal amounts of margin on legitimate markets with actual people, so small swings in the wrong direction will eventually bankrupt their customers (they don't even bother going after your "debt" in most cases, they know that most people will eventually loose everything they put in, and being that your debt isn't owed to other traders they have no reason to go after it).

The wallet is encrypted just fine (well technically you can crack it, there are howtos available for people who forgot their password).
The bigger problem here is that bitcoind will let any application execute a `sendtoaddress` regardless if that application supplied it with a password.  Once you initiate a `walletpassphrase` your wallet is essentially "open" for any kind of malicious software to steal from.
The reason there is an API interface for bitcoind is because it was built for web applications, not for desktop applications.  Desktop applications should be able to access bitcoind via a piping interface which would make it 100 times more secure.  The API interface is the reason websites continue being hacked and having their bitcoins stolen and the same security problems that exist for web applications exist for desktop applications like bitcoin-qt as well.

This isn't from day trading.  It's a well known indicator and results from a lot of people "giving up" on a new low, fearing they'd lose more, but by chance there was a lot of buy support at that price point because a lot of people wanted in.  This usually indicates that a number of large sellers are now out of the market, resulting in overall less sell pressure, leading to an increase in prices.
This has happened several times in bitcoin history.
Check out:  where this pattern has *always* triggered short term bull runs (actually you can see four more examples of this in the graph linked, one just a couple days ago, three before it jumped to $200 -- the indicator is really obvious to spot -- large volume on a relative low).

Your argument was that HFT doesn't effect lag in the stock market when clearly there are proven algorithms designed specifically to introduce artificial latency.  In this particular case they're speculating that latency manipulation is taking advantage of other bots but there's a lot of evidence that [this]( was caused by HFT and there are a lot of similarities to HFT in the stock market and the HFT "DDOS" manipulation on GOX (where bots are spamming orders, then canceling them).  Your original point was that if they had a proper trading engine this activity wouldn't cause lag when clearly even the stock market, which presumably has a "proper trade engine", has the same problem.
Also the LSE has gone offline, completely, due to HFT and upgrades designed to accommodate increasing HFT strain on the exchange.  Even though they were only out for some 40-odd seconds, vs the couple hours that Gox was down, it's still an example of similar problems that affect larger, "proper trade engines".  Plus the LSE / NYSE aren't even online; if there was a direct connection to either exchange over the Internet, like we have with Gox, you better believe they'd experience the same kinds of problems Gox is having, regardless how "proper" their trade engine is.

No, they have entirely different proof of work algorithms.  Bitcoin ASICS for example cannot mine litecoin.  It would be significantly more expensive (as a fraction of market cap) to attack litecoin than it would to attack bitcoin, largely because memory and cache are so damn expensive compared to the basic circuitry you need for a bitcoin ASICS.
This is in contract to teracoin which is like litecoin but uses a hash proof-of-work, like bitcoin.  A single ASICS could monopolize and destroy terracoin, today, without any warning, and this threat will not change unless terracoin manages to completely overtake bitcoin.
Litecoin is useful specifically because an attack on bitcoin would be unsuccessful against litecoin.

Napster mp3s were the one's that tended to be 90 KB (MAX).  You only ever had larger mp3s if you ripped them yourself.  Internet was slow and nobody could listen to 10 GB worth of music.  It was impossible.  Not even today, unless your collection is all FLAC.  ipods sold to the technically challenged, which happened to be a lot of people, but like I said anyone who knew anything about technology back then would have (and did) avoid ipods.

Lol you don't think this happens in private companies?  How many people do you think get paid to sit here and post on reddit \**looks around nervously*\*.  Corporate inefficiencies are quite common, not that people spending time on facebook or taking long lunches is the problem, just that the guys at the branch office barking orders down from corporate, organizing meetings and seminars, followed up with internal reviews, introduce a lot of waste in the system.


Private sector pays better.  Public sector often has better benefits, like an actual pension instead of a 401k, but you usually make 2 / 3 what you make in the private sector.
As for not getting fired it just depends on your position.  Once you have your own office it's hard to get fired.  If you're in a cubicle then yeah, once corporate does something stupid and the company starts having problems you might get laid off but I think if you actually worked an office job you'd be surprised how things actually work.

BTC-E is having *lots* of problems.  Their site often lags out so the orders you make are 30+ seconds behind the rest of the site, making them lag behind price as an out of date bid / ask that you then have to cancel and try to "guess" what the current price is.

I've been thinking, long before the crash, about a coin that would increase coin production with total hashing power.  There are stated reasons why Satoshi didn't do this, mainly because it would lead to hyperinflation as more and more people started mining, but I think it's possible to pull off with a few modifications.
A good way around this would be to increase coin production logarithmically, with a bottom, and at the very least a top, on coin production.  Being that mining is a good indicator of interest, this would increase supply as demand for the coin increased while still avoiding problems associated with an uncapped, ever increasing coin supply.
Also to add to your bullets I think this would be a feature that would destroy all current alt coins (including bitcoin):
  * Doesn't make use of a block chain, doesn't require the entire block chain history to bootstrap new clients
You can prune the block chain to make it smaller on your drive (in theory anyway).  The problem is you have to download the entire block chain exactly once to do this, meaning there have to be supernodes hosted by somebody with enough bandwidth and disk space to be able to meet the needs of the network.  In theory this would never be a problem if bitcoin took off at some point but if it doesn't it means the entire currency could eventually die off. A different method with a better block chain, or no block chain at all, would ensure that at the very least there is a basic payment network, even if just for fun, that people would use regardless how successful is is because it's not hogging up enough resources for people to notice it running on their computer.

This is exactly what people said about BTC mining for a really long time.  People would mine BTC and immediately sell it for fiat because "bitcoin is useless but I can sell it to idiots for actual money".
This is exactly how BTC started and it's interesting to watch litecoin taking this exact same path.  There are quite a few litecoin proponents who were very early bitcoin proponents.

Even the smaller exchanges like btc-e have regular periods of 30 second lag and these sites don't even have market orders so you have to guess what the correct price is.  At least Mt. Gox has market orders so you don't have worry too much about how much lag there is.

Put in the numbers in that calculator above.  I'm finding that about 8 litecoin blocks give you similar security as 6 bitcoin blocks.  
The problem is actually known as "gambler's ruin" and the reason litecoin might be more secure is because there are more "roles of the dice" meaning someone with less than 50% odds have less of a chance of temporarily beating those odds.
However as a function of time there is overall less hashing power involved so if you can get your hands on a large supercomputer or botnet you'd only need 17.5 minutes to be able to fork litecoin (assuming everyone relied on 7 confirms instead of 24) but the only reason I see that as a threat is because litecoin is like 1 / 10 the size of bitcoin.

stdin / stdout file descriptors.  That way you can query bitcoind, tell it "I want to send a transaction", it could reply back "slow down there partner what's your password", then you could send it your password and it would send your transaction without ever being in an unlocked state where other applications can send out transactions without needing to know your password.
As it is now a legitimate application sends it a password putting it in an unlocked state, sends it the transfer btc request, then sends it a `walletlock` to put in a locked state.  During that period, which is a couple second gap while bitcoind is busy crunching ECDSA numbers, any other application can also send in a sendtoaddress call, *without ever needing to give it a password*, which is probably exactly how OP had his bitcoins stolen.

I don't see how you can call it fucking up when major financial institutions like the NYSE can't do it any better than they are.  Hell many brokers go offline also, sometimes for periods of multiple days at a time.  Search google for any major broker with the term "down" or "offline" and you'll see plenty of news articles over the years where they've collapsed under load, have been DDOSed or otherwise hacked (and don't even ask me about 1999 -- they were ALL down for DAYS).
If you'd have been awake the past couple years you would have also seen [HFT]( crash several stock markets, multiple times, and not just prices but the actual trading backbones of the stock market.
And if you've ever traded the stock market you'd know that not only do you see 20+ minute lag, 20+ minute lag is *normal*.  A majority of people here on reddit wouldn't last 1 second trading on the stock market.  They'd blame their broker for all their loses (OMG lag, OMG it takes 20 minutes to cancel my order) and then they'd walk away licking their wounds cause they didn't have a fundamental understanding of what they were doing.

No, the idea is that fundamentals / technicals clearly indicate a bull market forming and the manipulator uses these tactics to acquire a large position in the market, temporarily making it appear to be a bear market, among other methods.

I see and appreciate your sarcasm here.  Yes someone running an asics would most likely be running as a full node meaning `getblocktemplate` is a fairly good solution here, even if I don't like it much.
But it still doesn't stop a pool operator from switching at some point (a point I made several posts above).  I doubt miners are going to put off profits if `getblocktemplate` temporarily stops working for some reason.  Pools will most likely fall back to the old method and miners will probably mine using the old method *automatically* meaning a pool operator still wields a considerable amount of power here.

Only if you buy billion dollar real estate across the street from the exchange.  You cant get microsecond lag anywhere unless you're physically right beside (on on) what you're using.  This is a limitation of the laws of physics.
For 99% of people who trade stocks your "lag" is effectively 20 minutes, not because of physics, but because of the underlying mechanics of brokers and exchanges.  If you want sub minute lag you need a decent amount cash every month to pay for a subscription service.  If you want sub second lag you need at least a billion dollars and a few months to construct a new building physically beside one of the exchange.

Yes the difference between CPU mining and GPU mining isn't nearly as large as what it is for bitcoin meaning people without GPUs can (and do) mine litecoin.
There is however another unforeseen advantage of script mining and that is FPGAs are very uneconomical (due to memory costs) and ASICS will be even less economical than FPGAs meaning people with GPUs are always guaranteed to be able to mine litecoin.  This leads to less centralization like we're seeing with bitcoin.

That's just the reference protocol.  Miners can and do mine zero fee transactions.  In fact there used to be an entirely separate reference protocol used by Eligius.  I don't know if they stopped that or what but it used to be they required 0.00004096 BTC per every 512 bytes, regardless of coin age or any other factor.
Lots of other miners will include any transaction with a 0.0005 BTC fee, taken in order of coin age.
And of course like I said zero fee transactions do get included it just takes a long time.
The fees are set by the miners and even the reference fee is a floating point, likely to change in the future depending on network requirements.  In fact ever sense 2+ years ago the reference fee requirement has been almost irrelevant, except to the behavior of the vanilla client, which has always been inconsistent with the way the rest of the network operates.

I wasn't arguing your point, just the idea that cannabis is a "weed" and "grows everywhere".  The government isn't magically spraying every single acre of the country with anti-cannabis chemicals; it actually doesn't grow well in most of the US because of local fauna.  *Sativa* is a weed but it grows in tropical climates, unlike *indica* which will grow in temperate climates but isn't anything close to a weed.  Meaning you could probably find if you tried hard enough but it wont start invading your flower beds if the government were to stop spraying its airline contrails (or whatever it is they're doing to magically kill off all the weed).
If you go to India you can find sativa growing along the streets pretty much everywhere but nobody smokes it because it has low THC content and the females are usually pollinated.  Growing good weed is difficult, much harder than growing eg corn or potatoes.  You can look at a plant the wrong way and it will shrivel up and die on you.  Which is why it's a commercial industry, contrary to some people saying weed would never be commercialized because everyone would just grow it themselves.

Litecoin in theory is *less* susceptible due to the mining hardware being more sophisticated and now that GPU miners are switching it will be ever harder.  Bitcoin miners with their new ASICS wont be able to mine litecoin so they wont be able to "destroy" it even if they have orders of magnitude more hashing power.
Granted a *third* currency that's either hashing or script will be vulnerable because then litecoin miners could kill the alt script currency and bitcoin miners could kill the alt hash currency but it's still kind of a bad idea.  If bitcoin miners killed terracoin for example news stories would go on about how cryptocurencies have been destroyed and therefore nobody should trust bitcoin etc but on that note I see zero reason for terracoin to exist.  I'm not against the idea but terracoin is really just a cross between litecoin and bitcoin with nothing that revolutionary to add while at the same time being vulnerable to bitcoin miners if they ever deem it a threat.

The thing is we already know how to "break" (reverse) ECDSA, the methods just require significantly more computational power than what is required to sign a message or generate a public key.  It's not a hashing function like sha, it's based on an actual branch of mathematics and exploits the fact that it's easier to get y from f(x) then x from f(x) = y (where solving for y is possible, and mathematically known, just extraordinarily complicated).  You'd have to break maths in order to find a better way to break ECDSA.


This is potentially true for hashing functions but not so much for signature algorithms.  DSA has been around for *decades* and has never been cracked like you're suggesting.  We pretty much knew from day one exactly how to crack DSA and the reason it remains secure is because this known, mathematically proven way of cracking DSA requires significantly more computational power to do in reverse than forward.
I'm not saying it's necessarily immune from being cracked but you can't just use an example of broken hashing algos to say that signature algs are also vulnerable (or even that modern hashing algos are vulnerable).  It's a play on language that is not only misleading, but is factually untrue to begin with.

No it means there are 4 times as many blocks with 1 / 4 the size.  While having more blocks poses its own technical challenges it has at least one benefit -- bandwidth usage is more predictable, with a much smaller burst (peak usage requirement) which is a problem bitcoin might experience and is one of the main reasons people want to cap the blocksize to a sane level.  If bandwidth requirements go up it will cause miners and nodes to become too centralized.  Litecoin's script proof of work and lower bandwidth requirements ensure the network remains decentralized.

And for miners who join the pool to not set `getwork` as a backup if `getblocktemplate` goes down temporarily.  There is after all a financial incentive to do so (it would allow you to keep mining instead of letting your miner go idle).  If a pool were to try something like that I figure it would be obvious.

That's the basics of what a spread trading bot does but that's not necessarily what HFT is.

Seeing how bitcoind doesn't differentiate between different applications, as long as one application has temporarily called `walletpassphrase` then any other application can use it during that time.  Also note that be default `walletpassphrase` unlocks bitcoind *indefinitely* which is probably why so many webservices get hacked.  bitcoind ends up staying unlocked, or being unlocked long enough for other web services to use it, allowing a hacker to call bitcoind during periods that its been unlocked.
The same is probably true for bitcoin-qt even though I imagine the process of `walletpassphrase` and `walletlock` is more streamlined.  If you have a virus on your computer all it has to do is wait for you to run bitcoin-qt.  It doesn't need to log your password, bitcoin-qt will actually unlock bitcoind at some point and during the brief period of time that its unlocked a virus can access your funds.  This is why it's a problem and is why more and more desktop users are going to have their bitcoins stolen.  Relying on API calls and a temporary "locked" / "unlocked" state for bitcoind is just bad security design.

The London stock exchange had a couple incidents between 2009 and 2011 that were related to HFT trading and a system upgrade designed specifically to accommodate more HFT traffic, where the exchange was down for either a few minutes or a few tens of seconds.
HFT also regularly introduces lag in the stock market.  The idea is to spam orders away from the bid/ask prices (so they're never executed), then cancel those orders, then resubmit more orders to introduce lag at specific times so HFT algorithms can steal money while the exchanges struggle to catch up.  It's really not all that different from what we saw with Mt. Gox.

There are 2^128 public keys, which hash to an address space of 2^160, most of which are invalid addresses that can never be used.
The first number is the important one you'd want to look at.
Granted I think the birthday problem becomes relevant at some point but go ahead and have a billion supercomputers crunching a billion addresses a second, a feet most likely impossible for hundreds of years, and see how likely it would be to find an address collision.
    2^128÷1000000000÷1000000000÷60÷60÷24÷365 = 10790283070806 years
to crawl the address space
    2^128÷10000000000÷1000000000÷1000000000÷60÷60÷24÷365 = 1079 years
to find an address out of 10 billion used addresses
A 1% shot puts the attack at 10 years, to potentially find "change" somewhere...
Perhaps the birthday problem *is* relevant but at this point all these numbers are just guesses, and the scenario where we can check a billion billion addresses a second is relatively far fetched.  Having 10 billion addresses in use would also slow down the search algorithm by a factor of log2(x), or 23, so our base computational ability would be 23 billion billion address a second.
Also you have to consider how much more profitable it would be to simply mine with those supercomputers then it would to find statistically 0.0021 BTC in an address somewhere (transaction fees are already larger than this).

Yeah I figure people will use bitcents which is 1 / 100 of a bitcoin.  The *tera* prefix then is 1 / 100 of a bitcent.  And if it were ever needed there could be another unit at 1 / 100 of that prefix.  It's a lot better then thinking in thousands, especially considering a bitcoin is divisible by an even number, not an odd one.  Each unit is 100x the last one.  Instead of maybe 10x (mili-centi), 100x(satoshi-µ), 1,000x(µ-m), 100,000x(s-m) etc, it's 100x, 100x\*100x, or 100x\*100x\*100x for a third a unit, meaning it's ALWAYS predictable no matter which units we go between.  If a bitcoin were divisible by 9 places and nobody ever used bitcents then it would always be 1,000x the last digit but that's NOT what we have here, hence 100x, or powers of 2 / 4, make a whole lot more sense.

The reference protocol is set up so a "normal" (1 input) transaction using an input of 1 BTC of age 1 day will get included in the next block for free (without needing a transaction fee).
An 11 BTC transaction will need an average age of 1/11 days or 2.2 hours so assuming you got the 11 BTC and immediately spent them the max amount of time you'd have to wait is 2.2 hours (if the inputs are older than the 1 BTC / 1 day ratio before you spend them it would in theory get included immediately, or wait in limbo until the ratio becomes true).
I'm thinking that a lot of pools no longer follow the reference protocol but usually one half the size of the blocks they mine do follow it (the rest of the block just includes anything with a 0.005 fee, many of which wouldn't actually have high enough priority to be included in the first half of the block).
The fact that your transaction hasn't been included yet means it was probably made up of a bunch of really small inputs, increasing the size of your transaction, which decreases its priority.

So what exactly does that mean, if you don't mind, and why is a preimage attack more relevant than a collision attack?  I assume taking into account the birthday problem that we are specifically looking for collisions, hence the distinction between 256 bit private keys, 128 bit public key complexity (?), and 160 bit ripe-160 hashes.
What I've gathered is that the 128 bit security level for a puplic key is only relevant for a single key, meaning someone finds an address that's been spent form, uses fancy ECDSA math and can brute force the private key with complexity 2^128 (as opposed to 2^256 ).  If someone were to scour the bitcoin public address space however would we be looking at complicity 2^160 because of ripe160 or would it actually be 2^80 due to the fact that we're looking for collisions?

Also you mentioned strippers which I think you can buy on this site:
Not a whole lot in comparison but considering LTC is in theory worth 1/4 of BTC at the same market cap, and LTC is maybe two years behind BTC in development, its actual value seems to reflect what BTC was at that stage of development (1/4 of ~$2 is 50 cents).

Any transaction with average inputs of size 1 BTC and age 1 day does not need a fee to be processed (eg .1 BTC at age 10 or 10 BTC at age 1 / 10 days).
The only exception is when you have lots of inputs that increase the size of your transaction.
Any transaction that does not meet the 1 BTC / 1 day ratio will "mature" and be processed once it reaches the ratio.
See: 
    priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes &gt; 57,600,000
Note that transaction size is not he physical size of your transaction on disk.  In my experience it's usually around half that.  You can check how big your transaction is ahead of time here: 
Clients should really calculate this for you and let you know ahead of time but AFAIK brainwallet.org is the only place you can do this.
An alternative standard is enforced by the  [eligius pool]( which mines on average two blocks per day.  Eligius includes any transaction with a fee of 0.00004096 BTC per 512 bytes.  I think a flat fee as a function of size is more fair than the "priority" standard described above, especially as bitcoin becomes more valuable and .1 BTC transactions become more common than 1 BTC transactions, so maybe we'll move towards this eventually.

Right the point was that stock brokers, and occasionally the actual exchanges, have their own problems.  Do a google search for different brokers getting hacked.  It's happened more times than you'd probably think, and these are huge multi-million dollar brokers who have the budgets to advertise, quite aggressively, on television.  If they're getting hacked and DDOSed why do you expect Mt. Gox to be immune from this?


I used to use e-trade.  You can read about their policy here.  It's bogus how much they want to charge you:
They claim it's "free" but they bill you the difference if you don't make enough transactions to add up the tens of thousands of dollars *in fees* for your specific account level (known as "pro elite").  They do the same thing for intro accounts which require 100 trades IIRC.  If you make 10 trades in a day they charge you for the 90 trades you didn't do.


See this is where you're wrong.  I have experience trading on the stock market.  You don't.  Trading with a 15 to 30 minute delay is *normal*, for *everyone*.  Taking 15 to 30 minutes to cancel a previously queued trade, without guarantee of it actually being canceled, is *normal*.
Only if you're some big shot trader with tens of thousands of dollars worth of trades (in fees, per month/quarter) do you fork out extra money for live quotes.  Now you can sit here all day and try to deny this or you can actually set up your own account, make a few trades, read a few newbie intro articles, and see for yourself 100% that what I said is true.  It's **plainly normal** to expect 20 minute lag when trading the stock market.  Just ask **anyone ever** who actually has experience with this.

If bitcoin had 9 decimal places then maybe mili/micro would have worked but with 8 decimal places using mili/micro is far less than optimal, almost self-limiting.  Bitcoin is a new paradigm and shouldn't be limited by old ways of doing things.

ECDSA is used to sign messages inside the bitcoin network.
I had a guy here on reddit trying to tell me the other day that ECDSA was a cipher, that ciphers are constantly being broken, and that bitcoin therefore was going to be broken eventually.
The fact that DSA and other signing algorimths have been around sense 1991 and have *never* been broken gives me a lot of confidence in the protocol.  I guess there's a lot of confusion out there about cryptography so there will always be a lot of skeptics, especially when ciphers do get broken every now and then, but signing algorithms are a bit different from most forms of cryptography.
Signing algorithms rely on known mathematical functions where it's easy to get y from f(x)=y but difficult to get x from x=f(y).  It's not difficult in that the problem is hard to solve -- we know the actual solution, it's just significantly more difficult from a computational standpoint to solve in reverse than it is to simply compute f(x).  It's not like some new algorithm will come along and find a better way to do it -- it is mathematically proven that this is the best way to solve the problem, and is incidentally why we know quantum computers might be able to do it a little faster, but there is no "breaking" the laws of mathematics like you might 'break" a cipher or some other form of cryptography (which is still based on maths, just in a different way)  (/rant)

Gambler's ruin guarantees that litecoin is as secure as bitcoin at less than 60 minutes but I've never seen the exact math showing where they become equal.
The reason is simple: with more confirms and averages being against the double spender (sub 50% hashing power) litecoin gives more "roles of the dice" reducing the likelihood of an attacker beating the odds and executing a successful double spend.

Pyramid schemes always sell a product, usually down the pyramid to the people bellow you.  The guy above you convinces you to buy bulk, then you sell that to the people under you, and the guys at the bottom are stuck with thousands of dollars of worthless products that they cant sell to anyone.

Yeah your ability to successfully commit a double spend is roughly equivalent to your ability to temporarily defeat gambler's ruin.
Your actual odds can be less than 50% but you will eventually "beat the odds", at least temporarily, if you play long enough.
At 35% hashing power a pool has a 1.09375% chance of mining 6 blocks in a row, giving them a 26.25% chance per day\*.  Anything that high should be considered relatively dangerous to the network.  Right now we'd probably see any double spends *at some point* and revert the network back to some checkpoint but it would destroy people's confidence in the coin.  I expect BTC Guild to be trustworthy but long-term we really shouldn't let this continue.
\*Technically this number should be higher, a kind of [poison distribution]( but it should approximate the binomial distribution at 26.25% (*I think*).

The problem is people are irresponsible and underestimate how much they make use of government services.
If your house were on fire, or if you were dying of a heart attack, you'd expect prompt service from either the fire department or the hospital, and then be unable to pay the bill.  When you're unable to pay the bill, the money inevitably has to comes from taxes.
People always want to believe "it can't happen to me".  "*My* house wont ever catch on fire".  "*I* wont ever have a heart attack".  "*I* wont ever get in a car accident".
As a result people wont pay for fire services, they *don't* pay for medical insurance, and they *wouldn't* pay for car insurance if it weren't mandated by law.  This last issue prompted us to mandate that car insurance be required by everyone on the road because so many people refused to get it and would then recklessly drive around their cheap aftermarket cars, destroying other people's property, and then be unable to pay for the damages.

I'm thinking one of these services could "pay" people bitcoins for computing power and get people to switch.  Right now mining is becoming less and less profitable and now that a bunch of people have been running their rigs 24/7 the idea of "donating" clock cycles isn't too alien.  A small incentive and the knowledge you're doing something to benefit humanity (and getting acknowledged/rewarded) might be all they need for a few extra clockcycles.
Not to mention they could have a bitcoin donation button to help fund the experiment.  The problem though would be current people using these services taking offence to it.  Like I could see a few people being angry, "it's supposed to be a donation".
There are however separate "mining pools" for these services unrelated to the actual project that compete to get their names at the top of the list and these "pools" have had contests in the past giving away free GPUs to people who submit the most work or entering people in drawings with tickets equal to the amount of work your submit.  The idea for the free GPU is you could game on it and also use it to help the project when you weren't gaming.  Maybe someone from could found one of these pools, accept donations, and pay out donations to people mining, competing with the other pools and generating a little bit of buzz for bitcoin at the same time.

@_date: 2013-04-17 13:23:06
What you're describing is a market bottom driven by capitulation.  People with lots of coins love "walls"  because they can sell into them without any slippage.  Even "fake" walls will be bought / sold, despite the wishes of potential market manipulators, if a single order goes through at that price.
When there's a new bottom with a lot of volume what's happened is a lot of people have given up and gotten out all at once while coincidentally the same price offered lots of buy support.  Without those walls prices would continue dropping as holders "give up" until a point at which people decide to buy.
This can happen because of human psychology (people want to get out) or because of stop-loss orders, which we do have in bitcoin land via bot trading.  It's a highly predictive pattern seen in every market in the world and remains highly predictive despite most people knowing about it, largely because it *is* driven by mass psychology, which as a whole is predictable.  Also by definition you need capitulation in order to have a bottom -- sellers have to get out, reducing sell pressure, in order for prices to start going up.

If you get the "not enough funds" error then your order never made it to the order book, although it will remain as a local order until you have funds to fill it (either because another order executed or because you deposited USD / BTC).
My guess is someone is taking advantage of this by creating and removing lots of unfunded orders, creating server lag, and Mt. Gox is moving to fix that.  A few people do actually use this feature.  You can create a buy with a high limit and then transfer funds into Gox (which can take a couple days) and then not worry about watching your account for your funds to be credited, knowing you'll automatically buy BTC whenever that happens.

Oanda is a bit different in that it's a true exchange and not a dark pool played against the broker.  It is however still true that you can only deal with whatever local currency you deposit with (so if you're American you use USD, if you're European you use EUR -- no EUR to USD is possible with oanda).
They have plenty of liquidty problems as a result but there's also opportunities for people who have enough resources to use real forex and set up foreign bank accounts to take advantage of arbitrage.
Usually arbitrage is fairly rare with forex because it's a pretty liquid market -- in fact, *actual* forex is the single most liquid market on the planet.  Oanda being psudo forex isn't quite as liquid.
Oanda notwithstanding it is pretty common for "forex" companies to only deal with a single currency.  Even Oanda works this way *in practice*.  To be able to deposit USD and withdrawal YEN/EUR for example would require paying heavy fees and dealing with larger sums of money.

Mt. Gox has a very large staff, with a TON of features, especially useful for merchants, and they operate in quite a few countries around the world to make this possible.  Part of that "profit" allows them to give much better service than any other bitcoin exchange out there.
I speak from experience having using several other exchanges, including BTC-E which has only a .2% fee, and I very much consider the extra .4% fee on Mt. Gox to be worth it considering what they offer over these other exchanges.

Scrypt ASICS isn't as big of an issue because the opportunity cost is much less when mining with a desktop vs an ASICS.  This isn't the case with bitcoin where ASICS are entire orders of magnitude more efficient than GPU mining.  A scrypt ASICS is essentially a specialized GPU, meaning it will never be that much cheaper to buy an ASICS than it is to buy a GPU.  In fact, when GPU is the *only* cost, you might find single GPUs being cheaper than ASICS, with only full computer builds costing more.

Well yes I agree with you there and as I mentioned earlier they are restructuring their system to work "behind the scenes" (as best as I can tell).  They're also the only bitcoin exchange I know of right now that's doing this or that even has the ability to deal with more than a few transactions per second (which cause most of the other exchanges to buckle under the load).
If you compare Mt. Gox to any other exchange right now you'll probably agree that they have the best infrastructure out there at the moment.  If you remember yesterday not only was Mt. Gox down but most of the other exchanges were as well.
BTC-E, when they were even up, suffered from quite a bit of lag but unlike Mt. Gox they don't have a lag indicator, nor do they even have market orders.  You can be looking at an orderbook more than a minute old without even knowing that it's out of date by a single second, forcing you to "shoot" your orders way above (or bellow) the current price hoping that it'll get executed (*if* it gets executed, sometimes the processing indicator just spins and it never goes through).  And of course it doesn't really help that BTC-E support goes to sleep Russia time (not that they're very helpful to begin with, another area where Mt. Gox appears to excel over other exchanges).

I'm pretty sure he's asking if the paper wallet algorithm he's using (eg  or something) is deterministic or has low entropy.
I think the answer to this is no but simply talking about the entire bitcoin address space, of which his wallet generator is necessarily a subset of, doesn't even remotely address his question.
Also FYI the namespace from a 256 bit ECDSA private key is 2^128, not 2^256, and technically the namespace for public bitcoin addresses is slightly smaller than this because multiple public keys can (in theory) hash to the same address.

On average a fundamentals trader will see the news long after technical traders have already reacted (this is because it only takes 1% of fundamental traders to see and react or news before 100% of technical traders see it reflected in short term price/volume movements).
This is why insider trading can be seen (and often reacted on) by technical analysts long before any relevant news is made available to the general public.

Give them a year and they'll probably start accepting bitcoin.  It's not nearly as depressing of a situation as some people here seem to think it is.
It sounds like they are coming around to the idea of bitcoin but don't have the time right now to juggle with it.  I'd say it's a good first step.  Reddit didn't start accepting bitcoin overnight and there wasn't a whole lot of information that they were setting things up until they had actually launched it.  It was basically a "we'll think about it" situation and the reddit admins said it was a lot more complicated than people here thought it would be (integrating code in the site, which had to be triple checked etc).  Probably they didn't want to make any promises that they might have to go back on (if their deal with coinbase fell through for example).
Humble Bundle is even more complicated in this respect because the people they're paying expect dollars, and there's usually an option for a steam key (which they pay a processing fee for), so it has to be integrated very tightly on several different layers for it to work properly.
Plus lawyers are stubborn.  Let the idea of bitcoin bounce around in their heads for a while and it'll start to seem less scary to them (especially if everyone else in the company starts pushing for it).

No both you and the guy bellow you are incredibly wrong here.
It was a sell into someone's buy order.
There are *buy orders* and *sell orders* at different prices and if you want to sell your coins immediately (instead of waiting for someone to buy at your sell price) then you hit "sell bitcoins" (*what it actually says on Mt. Gox*) and sell into the $50 buy wall.
The fact that "someone sells, someone buys" is only trivially true and what you're trying to say here is that every trade ever is a buy and that selling simply doesn't happen.  The standard terminology is that if the initiator initiated a *sell order* then it's "selling" and if the initiator initiated a *buy order* then it is "buying".  Not just for bitcoin but for every commodity everywhere.

Your bitcoin address doesn't have a simple "balance".  All transactions take inputs, where you've received bitcoins from previous transactions, and use those as outputs in new transactions.  This is how you prove that you have those coins, and is also why the entire block chain is needed, at least on some level, ~~to validate that transactions are valid~~ to validate transactions.

It seems like it would be more profitable to target a single address with spent outputs because you could do it with 2^128 complexity.  However, I assume you wouldn't be able to take advantage of the birthday problem because the "tricks" to reduce complicity of a single public key cant be expanded for a list of public keys.  This makes your likelihood of success very small ([5395141535403]( years for 50% at a billion billion tries a second).
That makes bitcoin entire orders of magnitude more secure than I originally "calculated".  I was always thinking about the birthday problem in addition to 2^128 complexity but 2^160 is so much bigger it's basically not relevant until you hit 2^32 addresses, I assume (160-32=128), but even then you're better off trying to crack a single address because on average each address would have 21,000,000/2^32 coins or 0.00488944 BTC.

Kind of reads like the author cut off and stopped writing mid paragraph.

Which is distributed globally, ofshoring the number of direct connections to the exchange by a HUGE amount, and runs at 20+ minutes of lag.
And to be fair Mt. Gox *is* upgrading their trade engine software.  My guess is it has something to do with coinlab but it sounds like it could help quite a bit.

How so?  If I sell processed plutonium knowing it's being used to build a dirty bomb am I somehow right to do so because it's my plutonium, their money, their choice to spend it, and my choice to sell it?
Many people see gambling as a kind of tax for the poor.  I'm not completely against it (being a poker and craps player myself) but letting the gambling industry run wild would have (and does have) disastrous consequences, particularly on the most vulnerable of society.

Well at least a few people over at bitcointalk agree with me, particularly the guy who runs casascius coins.
Another advantage of using a 10^-4 prefix is "bitcent" then makes more sense.  People are probably going to use bitcent just because it seems natural but it bumps right up against milibitcoin making it very confusing to use.  Having the new "standard" bitcoin unit be 10^-4 makes it easier to talk about bitcents and a lot harder to be off by a decimal place or two.

Send a transaction with bitcoin-qt and simultaneously send a transaction with bitcoind.  Write a script to do it cause a human *might* not be able to react fast enough (although I think there is like a 2 or 3 second window so you might be able to pull it off).

Instead of pointing out that your own link appears to disagree with you I figure I'll just post a graph since it's easier to look at:
Fact is people used to save money to buy a home / car.  It didn't used to be that everyone had to take out credit in order to literally survive.

There were also another 1,100~2,000 Greek soldiers fighting along side the Spartans (on the last day) plus 1,500 more that formed a rear guard for the retreat.

Actually you can under certain amounts.  Bitinstant will do Mt. Gox to paypal for unverified accounts.
I assume even after coinlab you will still be able to use Mt. Gox's main site.  The advantages of coin lab will be easier / cheaper wire transfer and a much faster queue process, meaning people will get in a lot faster.
Also there's the possibility that you'll be able to go about normal banking business with coinlab like you can with Mt. Gox in Japan.  Right now in Japan you can hold a psudo bank account denominated in bitcoin and add / withdrawal yen directly at  ATMs in the country (or at least that's the story some guy told us here who claims to be from Japan...)

Mt. Gox is located in Japan and is compliant with US regulations to the extent that US law requires (because they do business directly with US customers).  They're registered in quite a few countries actually.  You don't have to jump through hoops to use them like you did with Fulltilt.  Fulltilt used a third party bank located on some island somewhere (in Asia or the Caribbean) so they would be completely outside US jurisdiction.  I saw it as normal because lol gambling was supposed to be illegal so of course you had to send your money offshores somewhere.  Had poker been legal inside the US and run by legal, registered companies (US owned or otherwise) then such a thing would have never happened.
Mt. Gox isn't "overseas" in the sense that they're located in some wild west like country where people can get away with things that they otherwise wouldn't be able to.  They have the same kinds of protections against fraud in Japan as the US does and your money is held in New York city even as it's traded (theoretically) in Japan.

I think you're confusing [satire]( and the actual point of the Colbert report...
Also Jon was the first of the two to talk about SOPA and all that last year.  He even did a reddit AMA and we had a reddit shill on his show during one of the interviews who mentioned reddit / SOPA to Jon after the show.  Sure his description of SOPA was "the Internet has gone stupid" (cause it was when wikipedia went black) but he brought a lot of attention to the issue, did a lot more than than Colbert.
He does tend to take things less seriously than Colbert, except for his 15 minute interview segments, so I'd expect less information to be be presented but it's not like the publicity he'd bring would be a bad thing.

What gets me is holding gold and silver as a *commodity* (in other words paying an exchange to buy gold futures) is only taxed at 15%, sometimes less, depending on how rich you are and what tax loopholes are available to you.
A small time investor that buys a silver coin, watches it appreciate in value, and then sells at a pawn shop, gets taxed at 28%.  The wealthy get to live by a completely different set of rules than the rest of us.

Well if you're proposing either that monetary policy could have saved Rome, was the cause of their collapse, or in any other way could have effected their outcome then not only are you proposing an idea counter to the general consensus of the historical sciences but your proposal would make Rome a single anomaly out of all of history through the present.  Modern academia has a pretty good model for collapse and social progression that fits just about every other major society throughout all of history.
So good luck to you and your no-name professor from a no-name business school in the middle of Manhattan coming up with a brand new coherent theory with the same descriptive capabilities as current models.  All I see is a pep talk given at a [middle school level]( without a single hint of any kind of outline for any kind of descriptive model.
