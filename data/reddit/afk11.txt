Once a node is running how you like, there's virtually zero maintenance. I'm not sure a raspberry pi is the way to go - initial block download can take over a week (more?) I've heard, there's no USB3.0 interface, so external hard drives are really slow to use.
Re lightning, I wouldn't 100% wouldn't run it on a pi in case the SD card wore out and my state wasn't 100% up to date :/

Your wallet should probably be the one to do that, not bitpay.. It's up to your wallet to relate what the request actually asks for, b/c it can't verify that some text on a website laptop matches what's encoded in the payment request.

Payment protocol isn't a bad thing. If your wallet doesn't accept bech32 segwit addresses, BIP70 support means your wallet can pay to the output script directly. 
Bitpay have worn out all good will I've had for them, but in general I think bitcoin wallets should have gotten behind this a while ago. 
How else can bitpay go full segwit if they can't request payment on anything but 1.... or 3..... addresses?

We're still working away, I've been working on a new layout, and updates following a security audit, so will be pushing all that once it's done. 
Bitwasp is a centralized web application for bitcoin ecommerce, powered by bitcoind. It uses 2-of-3 multisignature transactions to secure funds, and offer escrow/dispute mediation. 
We have had some delays, really hoped to have a beta by now but we've had some setbacks.. so presently that is looking like July/August. 
Much of the work now is exposing multisig in an elegant way, so I am looking at passwords handled with javascript to generate keys (BIP32 pubkey sent to the server) and adding signatures in the browser, instead of forcing people to use bitcoin core to sign. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 11:16:28
I've spotted a few puzzle transactions like this in the blockchain -  that can be redeemed once you 'get' whats going on. The link is an article I wrote about spotting one and trying to claim the funds. 
The funds have yet to be redeemed. Have at it!
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:07:43
The site is just a way to advertise products, and if anyone buys them, the order process is designed to guide them through the steps of completing a multisignature transaction, whether its escrow or up-front. Depending on if it's escrow or not, the user thats asked to sign first changes, to enforce the desired contract. 
Since it's open source, you could start selling your own goods using multisig. Obviously escrow is no good if you're the only operator AND vendor however.

I'm not sure if BIP38 will see consensus. Most wallets don't support it, and the core devs have said 'There is no BIP0038'. I see it only existing as a tool for people to use outside of wallet software, unless this changes.

Onchain is a very neat service. A few of us at a bitcoin meetup tested this out one evening. We tried the webwallet, which was very neat. Mainly everyone loved that the wallet can be secured with users devices as a second factor. 
The app is fantastic also. One of my issues with GreenAddress, even Blockchain.info, is that they all claim not to have access to users funds. They could if they wanted to - they store your decrypted wallet, and send you javascript to decrypt it in their browser.. What happens if they decide to send malicious javascript one day? This situation is no different to them storing the private keys in the database. They can get them if they want to.
Onchain's app works with other sites too. It can send them master public keys, so the website can create as many receiving addresses or public keys for that user, without ever being exposed to private keys. The app does the signing, meaning you don't have to trust your wallet provider sending you dodgy JS one day.
The app is open source, and hell, I've even checked out the code and it looks great. But, even if the app was malicious, it can't steal OTHER users private keys.. so I'd trust it over a centralized javascript solution any day.
More of this please!

In bitcoin-qt you need to enter the redeemScript/scriptPubKey when running signrawtransaction, so it has the public keys, but I think you need to do addmultisig() as well before it will work. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:17:04
Cheers Vitalik, I'll be sure to check it out. Coinb.in/multisig gave me some strange results, so this will be great to include along with bitcoin core instructions! 
The one contentious issue with bitcoin core is it syncs the full chain.. but once json inputs and a private key are provided to the signrawtransaction command it'll still work without saving the key (Once you do addmultisigaddress first)

Malleability actually compounds the issue of chain re-orgs. It's slightly harder to deal with. If you've stored a transaction ID/vout from a block which was orphaned, you cannot just search for the same ID in the new chain.
Chain re-orgs already meant that people had to essentailly forget everything that happened in the orphaned chain and start from scratch at the point when the fork occured. Because the transactions in the orphan chain may not have been mined yet to the highest-difficulty chain, you can't expect them to be there, and or be called the same thing. 
So I think to deal with this, developers need to keep an record of processed blocks in their app. Whenever your app is told about a block which doesn't refer to the last block in your record, then you have a reorg. You need to recurse backwards until you find a block that IS in the chain, and then do whatever you did before to look for incoming transactions again from this point in time. 
Since you cannot accept 0-confirmation payments due to malleability (as there could be an altered copy of the same transaction in the mem-pool), you're forced to only pay attention to the data in blocks. But by scraping the blocks you need to address reorgs.

Soft forks are a removal of a feature. They are backwards compatible, because older clients aren't expected to support anything new - certain events won't happen any more. Newer software would enforce this, but older clients wouldn't know about the change. 
A hard fork is more obvious. Everyone needs to upgrade, because something new is possible that wasn't before. There is no backwards compatibility in a hard fork, meaning ancient nodes that are still running will end up on their own forked blockchain, and the rest of the network gets on with the upgrade on the new fork. 
The consequences of a hard fork are annoying. Everyone needs to upgrade by a particular date/block height. There are still 0.7-0.8 clients on the network, it's hard to force everyone to upgrade :/
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:05:07
I had an idea for such a decentralized marketplace. It involves coding a client, which is a site people visit and enter a bitmessage address. The bitmessage address is one which someone created for the purpose of a decentralized marketplace. As such, they posted a public message from that message defining parameters that clients, like the site I propose, will scan for, and create a form with these same fields for people to post responses, and also a flip-board or plain thread system, showing the responses formatted with these fields.
The fields could include payment addresses, or public keys for multisig, contact details, or maybe it's for an exchange: define offers, at a rate, and amount, and whether its buy or sell.
The 'client' must be flexible software which basically gives the user a blob of (JSON) formatted text, which they must post from BitMessage to the address. 
It is these JSON formatted posts which would be parsed by using the initial parameters set up by the address. 
Decentralized messaging system, decentralized identification system OneName, and the blockchain, for decentralized escrow. 
It also means sites could probably be hosted using the BitMessage blockchain, whether they use the client I propose or not.

If yo're familiar with bitcoind and raw transactions, you could create the transaction on that machine, sign it, and broadcast elsewhere? Don't consider this if you haven't done it before, because it can be easy to forget a fee, or add way too much of a fee... but that's what I do. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 11:17:44
Yeah - you can do cash face to face, or work with bank transfers (though I haven't tried this avenue before). 
As apython88 said, do set up your own wallet to keep them in. 
I'd play with electrum if you're new. Set up a few wallets to see what it's like, and practice recovering it from your backup after loading with like 0.0004 to keep it interesting :)

This is how soft forks work. Miners are the most sensitive to them because they could produce an block that is invalid to the network. 
Although previous occasions where miners signaled the networks readiness, they have also signaled for forks without implementing the rules - causing them to fork themselves.
If a UASF rolls out it's up to miners not to mine an invalid block - as with any soft-fork - but in this case the date is known long in advance.

 author of bitcoin-php here. there aren't a lot of reasons this can happen, so my first question is are you running on a 32-bit architecture? My guess is the fingerprint has the 31st bit set, which 32-bit PHP will interpret as the sign, not a bit of the number. composer won't even let you install the library on 32-bit, for very good reason. always use composer to install dependencies.
if not, i'd like to see some of the following to get a full picture:
\* full exception backtrace (can't tell if this is during deserialization/creating a new master seed/deriving a child key)
\* a sample xpub, or if you can't share that, then share the 4-byte fingerprint with us instead \`Base58::decode($xpub)-&gt;slice(5, 4)-&gt;getHex()\` (3rd field from bip32, not private data [

You don't need to be online. Decoding a transaction is a text processing operation. You can download the built binary from [bitcoin.org]( and start it with connect=[0.0.0.0]( (means ONLY connect to this invalid IP).
It won't find peers then, and you can use the gui or rpc then to call decoderawtransaction with your transaction hex.
If that doesn't suit, use an online tool. 
[ &lt;-- they seem to call decoderawtransaction on their node
[ &lt;-- yet another online tool

@_date: 2019-10-16 14:45:37
My guess is the ASIC is actually optimized for SHA256d, not sha256, so mining hardware probably isn't useful.
Also,  even if it was possible, you still have to do EC scalar multiplication  to get the pubkey, which is much slower than SHA256. And still - after  that you have to perform RIPEMD160(SHA256()) on the pubkey, and  comparing against the hash encoded in 12FnVGpLqxmPTfENdyBso9HNbEdQEiHuhH
I'd optimize for scalar multiplication first.

Well, nLocktime and nSequence have always been there. nLocktime works fine, but nSequence has no enforcable behaviour whatsoever. BIP68 makes nSequence useful again.
BIP68 and median-past timelock give us intended behaviour of nSequence and nLockTime, which is basically required for CSV and CLTV.

Just a word of advice - bitcoin-lib-php won't see much in the way of new features, so you won't have to worry about BC breaks at any time. 
bitcoin-php is still a WIP and has no tagged versions, so breaks may happen (though most of the HierarchialKey stuff is unlikely to change). 
Note that both are pretty slow if you stick with pure PHP. The upstream elliptic curve library was fixed so that it's cryptographic operations are constant time and safe albeit very slow. 
The new library also supports a PHP extension which brings massive performance gains.. 
So if you can, I'd suggest using bitcoin-php.

 The BitWasp Electrum library is for the older type-1 deterministic wallet. If you're playing with xpubs, you mean BIP32:
If you're getting errors over unexpected [, your PHP version is PHP5.3 which does not support short array notation. 
    require_once "vendor/autoload.php";
    use BitWasp\BitcoinLib\BIP32;
    $address = BIP32::key_to_address($yourXPUB);
I'd suggest playing with this - it's an OOP library that beats bitcoin-lib hands down.  or via composer: bitwasp/bitcoin
    use BitWasp\Bitcoin\Key\HierarchicalKeyFactory;
    $xpub = 'xpub.......';
    $hk = HierarchialKeyFactory::fromExtended($xpub);
    $address = $hk-&gt;getAddress();
    echo $address-&gt;getAddress();

Bitcoin is a disaster for people receiving small recurring amounts.. I've seen people receiving LESS than the minimum fee, meaning their wallet won't even look at it. Spending it just increases the fee.

"and seems to constantly fail"
Could you be more specific?
Bitcoin is a developing protocol and service providers are struggling with exposing it in a friendly usable way. 
That you're exposed to it's sharp edges is a sign that more work needs to be done on UX by the community on the whole.. 
"Is there anything gained by dealing with these hardships?"
That's like an anti-truism - of course not. Complain to your service provider about your problems (which are?), or DIY with bitcoind's rawtransaction API or some code.

Bitwasp is an open source project. Given you actively post about bitcoin, you should understand where we stand in things. In the net's humble beginnings, there was Ebay, and few else. Since then credit card processing has moved onto the smallest of sites. We are providing software which allows people to set up a marketplace on their own site, free of charge, which accepts bitcoin.
Over the last few days, we have had someone offer a 1000$ bounty for the first vulnerability. If sincere, that will be going to someone who found a vulnerability in the wallet backup system. As we have stated publicly, donations will go towards bounties. People willing to put 1000$ into someone elses pocket for a vulnerability are a finite resource, but asking for small donations which allows us to do this ourselves is the next best thing. If 55BTC seems high, fuck it, we'll lower it. But once we settled on the 55BTC figure (literally copied/pasted the thermometer code on bitmerchant.tk from a site which had 55BTC as an example), this would have been $6600, and would fuel 6 bounties based on what the first person to offer to directly fund a bounty has offered. Right now it's 10K because of the exchange rate (and god knows where tomorrow), and based on this first person, would cover 10 exploits. 
Doesn't seem too high now, unless you'd be selfish when it comes to reimbursing people for their consideration. SOMEONE outside of our project needs to review things!
As we have said before, Bitwasp isn't a business, and we don't need funding to complete our project (have you seen any coins leave our donation address?). We ask for donations to incentive others to report exploits. 
There are others on the web insisting they get donations before they even publish code. You should reevaluate our project. I don't know why you'd think you'd need a licence to sell unless you didn't understand what we're doing. Or, why you'd assume bitcoins are solely used for drugs, for that matter. 
TLDR &amp; to answer your repeated concern: higher stakes for reporting vulnerabilities means more get reported.
edit: maybe should have posted under your second comment. But that would mean answering your uninformed feedback. Which actually I will: go to the test site, and the source code which others are using (seriously, go look what what we've done before trying to call us on anything), click on 'vendor's profile, and send him a message. You'll see the client side PGP happen in front of you. Then log in as vendor, and see it's the same PGP as you saw after clicking submit. 
further edit: I guess this is why we don't post on reddit. Questioning our character before reading the source code is juvenile. Anyone with a legitimate concern can contact us with it, and get paid for their efforts.

Someone has earned 2.71 btc for reporting a bounty so far, as shown in our forums. We paid him because it was in the ecdsa keypair generation code from bitcoin SCI (faulty RNG). We won't be giving bounties until a major release as many features are still in progress, but the privkey generation problem definitely warranted a payout!

Not really. You can set up your own site that accepts bitcoin for payment. It can be used for many vendors, or it can just be one person in charge of sales for it.
