Absolutely nothing of interest happened.  You have a much larger chance of winning the national lottery jackpot from a single ticket, than you have of something *remotely* harmful happening (like "`rm *`") after executing `/dev/urandom` thirty thousand times.
As for some code of computer-destroying magnitude to arise... Modern CPUs, OSes and general hardware have a huge amount of safeguards.  You're more likely to win the lottery every week for the rest of your life than to destroy your computer via /dev/urandom.

There are many ways, good and bad, to turn a profit.
Making money from something doesn't make it *right* and impervious to criticism.
In eBay's case, they provide bad service for an exorbitant fee.
Burglar: "So I smashed your window and ran off with your laptop, but I need to turn a profit here.  Stop calling me a bad person."

It does matter!  Some natural expectations don't hold for BTC, and it's *critical* to be aware of them.
With VISA or Mastercard there is central control of some kind, so that  A) if someone steals your card and spends money, you can have the balance refunded B) if you lose your wallet, you can get a new card by asking your bank, C) if you get scammed, you can reverse a transaction.  *None of these are possible with BTC, and will create nasty surprises for people who are unaware of them.*

Oh, I *do* care.  I also care enough that I want more people to think that digital freedoms are important and something they should demand and fight for.  Thus I disapprove of anyone portraying Linux users or free software people as arrogant, dismissive, sneering asshats.

I made this helpful chart to assist in deciding whether to pay up:
       OUTCOME   ~*~   | you pay    | you don't  |
        ~*~     CHART  | them       | pay them   |
    -------------------+------------+------------+
    they have          | they       | they       |
    the info           | sell it    | sell it    |

I really like the terms "private" and "public", as they describe the single most important thing to know about the keys:  *This* key is for hiding away in a secret place, and *this* key is for showing to everyone.
Also your crypto/signing explanation doesn't match:  You always keep the *private* key and send out the *public* key.  You don't need to reverse them for signing!

That property is in to way enabled or enforced simply by using *BitCoin* for money transfer.

Awesome!  I didn't know that, which is why I have my laptop melting away at a vanity address instead of renting a server.  Going to try that now.
It's sad that the bitcoinvanity.appspot site actually *had* split-key generation, but they *also* helpfully provided client-side javascript to combine it for convenience, and the client-side javascript is what turned out to be compromised.

I don't think that's completely true.  The only reason it's currently outside their grasp is because they haven't bothered to grab.  The minute they feel like doing some proper investigation and analysis, they can trace a lot of Bitcoins.

Such a serious accusation should be backed with a citation or source reference.

I then submit a rot13-encoded virus signature.  It will be a plain virus signature when stored.
This is mathematically viable for any symmetric encryption method you would choose to replace rot13 with.  And it would *need* to be symmetric to preserve the message content.

Or dropping dead, for that matter - you'd probably want family to inherit you.  Leave an unencrypted paper wallet in a safe / in a safety box / with a trusted family member along with instructions for safekeeping and how to extract funds if you are indisposed.

I ate five bitcoin security experts and assimilated their knowledge.  I now have 11.5 years of bitcoin experience.  HIRE ME.

Note that it may not be bitcoinvanity themselves that are the problem. *Edit: turns out it was, but it is still useful to consider the alternative attack vectors.*
The generated private key is at some point rendered in your browser.  This means your browser is an attack vector.
If you have installed a browser toolbar, dishonest browser plugin, or even an honest plugin that phones home for whatever reason (auto unit converter, skype click-to-talk, search engine indexers, etc) to a server that's been hacked, your private key is compromised.

Aww, thanks!  Just the thing to cheer me up after my disastrously stupid daytrading adventure earlier today.

Haha, it did indeed seem a bit mind-boggling at first glance.  "If everyone reading right now would donate 30,000 USD each..."

And otherwise unintuitive things like not sending their laptop in to service with a live bitcoin wallet on it.
Fortunately most of these risks have negligible consequences if they are just shuffling small amounts of BTC through the wallet to buy stuff.

Via any method that satisfies Alice's specific security needs for her communication with Bob, to be annoyingly vague.
For shopping websites SSL, a trust chain bundled with your browser usually suffices.
For sensitive software distribution (i.e. signed binaries from the developer), the developer can put out his public key or hashes of it on a multitude of places: FB profile, his website, discussion forums, in writing at the back of the book he wrote...  and you can verify his public key against that hash.  Fully compromising all of these is practically impossible.
For tinfoil-grade security, either show up and exchange keys in person or call up the person you're talking to and ask them to spell out a hash of their public key.

Keeping the cold storage digital is more risk and trouble than it's worth.
Have a savings address in a paper wallet.  Give a copy of the paper wallet to a trusted family member.  Transfer all excess not-immediately-needed coin to the savings address.

Makes sense to me.  If I'm giving blood as charity, I can consider it an invaluable service to society.  That makes me feel good.  If someone pays me an insulting amount like $25, I'm selling my blood for beer money.  That makes me feel exploited.

You sign a message with your private key, and others can verify your signature using your public key.
There's no "real" mathematical differenece between encrypting and signing.
Basically, when signing, you encrypt a hash of your message and give that as the signature.  People decrypt that using your public key, take a hash of the message, and check that they match.

And if you don't like having your home computer stuck calculating it for a week or four (the time my computer takes to generate 7 letters of vanity), go hire a XLarge2 instance on Amazon or something for $4 per day. Then compile and run vanitygen in a screen shell.
You are still at *some* risk by using a computer under a third party's control, but the attack vectors are greatly reduced.
