It’s because you touched yourself last night and Jesus saw. He wasn’t happy so he market sold his bags.

If you’re happy for your investment to either go up a lot or down a lot then yes, it’s a good idea.

Same, this is a disgrace. All I did was share crypto related news and follow other crypto enthusiasts. Had to start a whole new account as the first was perma locked.

This is why I always ask for my pay check in pennies, it’s more moneys!

Yes 100%, bitcoin is my savings account for the last 2 years. I have t even timed the market well at all and it’s still out performed what my bank would have done.

Fair enough. A 40% drop would scare me at this point so early in the uptrend, I’d almost expect us to keep plummeting to new lows at that point.

What if the ETF gets approved and then we hit the meme target of 16k in October. Would be mad scenes.

How is that different to an investment in any company? Apple, for instance. I didn’t imply early adopters need to cash out either, I plan on using the currency as a store of value long term.

To buy back In lower

Yes, all the late comers over the next few years who didn’t take a risk on early adoption and will be literally years behind the curve

He is making a reasonable and calculated risk. I think he is smart. He may turn out to be wrong but as opportunities go, how could there be a better one than bitcoin? He is more likely to regret missing out if he doesn’t go for it, than he would if he fails. As long as he can survive bitcoin going to zero, this is a decent decision.

It’s just a joke - ironic humour, with a dash of reality.

So everything you can profit on is just a ponzi? Bearing in mind any profit you can ever make is generally someone else’s loss.
@_date: 2018-07-05 08:15:01
The game of Crypto Ponzi is great, though. 
First, you buy at the very top when everyone is euphoric. Then the price collapses and you panic and sell at the bottom.
Then it goes back up so you panic buy back again, but it was just a dead cat bounce so you sell again back at the bottom. This happens a few times, and on the last time you decide you won’t be fooled again, so you decide to not buy back. Ha, you’re so smart.
But the currency then mega pumps well above all time high in the space of just a few weeks but you still don’t believe it, so you refuse to buy still, because you have it figured out now.
Then it goes so high you FOMO back in right at the peak of euphoria, and the whole process starts all over again.
Then eventually you decide you’ll just buy and hodl and the fad is over and prices slowly and agonisingly bleed all the way down to zero over the space of several years well after the whales have moved onto a new game.
It’s fun for the whole family!

Buy pressure caused a slight bend in time and space causing a momentary dip back into the past. Traders bought the dip heavily, instantly correcting the anomaly.
