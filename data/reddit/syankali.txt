Pff I’m getting really tired of everyone complaining and being shocked every time the price goes down again. Grow up. Investing doesn’t mean you will become a millionaire in one day. Make up your mind: do you believe in it or not? And why? Don’t let price influence this. Spend the half hour a day you watch price charts on improving the network instead. And yes you could lose everything. That’s how this works.

This is my theory on the crash this week. Would love to hear your thoughts on this.
It’s the end of Q3. Companies/Investment vehicles/banks are going to have to show reports to their investors or stakeholders who expect solid cash positions. Not bitcoin. So they take cash and buy back in the new quarter.
To support this:
The end of Q1 this year didnt see a significant price drop but on the 2nd of April the price jumped from 4100 to 4800 dollars in 1 day and grew rapidly after.
At the end of Q2 this year the price dropped from 13.7k on the 26th of June to 11.1K on the 30th of June. Recovering in July to 12.9K on July 10th. 
Kind of the idea that companies/investment banks are covering up their risky investments. Sounds not impossible right ;)
The next argument is why are prices declining since July? The answer is a shortage of cash in the markets which unfortunately also influences the crypto market in the short term. 
Sorry no fairytale prediction. But I think the price will recover in October.

It could be either one of them. It could be banks pulling out their money for sure. They also have to file reports.
