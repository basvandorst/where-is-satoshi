There is some truth to it I think. Also, that even the best traders are often guided by information that the rest of the world does not have or attempts to rig the game.
In the case of Ben Bernanke are his statements not to help "protect" the markets and economy as a whole? You can't be sure it isn't purely propaganda at that point.

Shouldn't you be able to buy this with Bitcoins?

I'm a relative n00b when it comes to bitcoin. Can someone ELI5 for me please?

Not sure if Flattr lets you pay / receive in bitcoin but I'd like to support my favourite artists through Grooveshark (using bitcoin) as they have just implemented a Flattr button for artists...

I'm not sure this is true. Plenty of regular people lost their savings in the UK during the 2008 crash and run on certain banks at that time. The bank has insurance to a certain level. Beyond that everyone is screwed if a bank folds.

Call me naive but won't this just cause the bank to fall before a large % of people can get their money out?

Hadn't heard of Keepkey. Looks good.
Does Keepkey allow you to spend bitcoin outside of your laptop. I'm thinking for small purchases rather than large ones.
Or is a secondary wallet for Android, or a credit card linked to Bitcoin best for this scenario?

That's not how cap gains works AFAIK. You pay cap gains when you cash out of an investment. I just went through this with a financial advisor last week... say you buy a house and the capital appreciates over 10yrs, you have to pay cap gains on it when you sell, not each year the value changes. Same with stocks and shares, unit trusts etc etc

I'm guessing here but surely the only illegal part is tax avoidance and not keeping anyone from freezing funds.
