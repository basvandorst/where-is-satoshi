Etherum has way more transactions and does not suffer this huge fee problem so it is definitely possible to fix. For example if we had a slightly higher block-size limit...
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:29:35
I don't think a slight increase to the block-chain size would lead to centralization more than say lightning network but that could just be me...
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:04:35
That's why I said for most use cases. There are ALWAYS potential for double spend attacks but as confirmations grow the chances decrease dramatically 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:57:45
They are doing regular transactions just like anybody else...
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:34:34
"New Era" aka what bitcoin was originally

Downvoted for the whiny title.

ITT: People who don't understand consolidating UTXO because it is not feasible on the bitcoin blockchain anymore 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:08:52
Prophecy? It used to be the norm before skyrocketing fees
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:04:29
Still a big fee even for a small transaction currently... 
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:08:53
Transactions are pretty much instant, it's the confirmations that take time. 0 confirmation transactions aren't really safe to accept due to easy abuse by replace by fee. However on some other coins (BCH) its OK to accept 0 confirmation transactions for most use cases 
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:20:25
Haha yeah a little bit. But the UTXO for bch is shrinking / growing a lot slower (even relative to transaction number) . 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:16:00
Agree its not the end all solution, what I was pointing out is etherum processes far more transactions with lower fees, why can't BTC do that? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:17:18
Is the optimal routing problem solved yet?
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:54:28
But you can buy the coke easily with the bitcoin so overall it's a win ��
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:17:58
Not really a scam if the calculator tells you what will happen is it? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:37:33
No. Ether processes similar amounts of transactions with very low fees for example 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:53:50
With that logic everytime it goes up for no reason you should sell? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:40:42
People often use services like shapeshift to "sever the connection" between coins so that they can't be traced via blockchain analysis. They have released a statement saying "whether from law enforcement agencies or private[parties] the company provides the information it does have"
Here's a reddit thread about it
 
Also if you Google shapeshift law enforcement (I'd recommend excluding wannacry related results or that's all you'll get) you can see a lot of discussion about it 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:14:18
Shapeshift is basically law enforcement heads up 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:13:41
Then you wouldn't wait for it to dip you'd just buy 
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:59:24
Because it split off from BTC and brought a lot of people who have been into the idea of Bitcoin early. It works really well too.
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:41:14
He claims even with this attack nobody can get the coins, is this true?
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:04:32
"If you get the coins you get the money"
Sounds like nobody got the money ya?
Article says the private keys arent stored on so sounds like nobody ever will?

@_date: 2017-02-03 00:02:58
more testing won't hurt tho
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:05:11
I don't think testing it on LC is the thing holding it back though. So while we wait for the situation to be resolved we might as well do more testing ya?
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:10:16
It's not really a hostile takeover since the takeover only happens if a majority of people agree.... 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:26:26
Mine was in the 0.0006 - 0.0008 mBTC range since yesterday and I still haven't gotten in (website says 2 hour delay). The mempool is the fullest it has ever been in BTC history this is not good
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:47:52
I don't think it's as clear cut as this article implies, there is a significant part of the community that backs BU 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:48:59
I wish there would be this compromise. Everyone in both subreddits thread are saying"it's too late". Fuck you guys, it's not too late! Don't let your emotional and pride get in the way!

@_date: 2017-03-16 19:08:53
I don't think anyone claims it's a majority. I'm saying it's a contested point and it's misleading to say the community had throughly rejected the idea 
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:51:58
The data is out there don't talk about it be about it!
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:45:59
It's more a battle of politics at this point. SegWit and a BU would be good, but neither side wants to accept the others solution because it would be seen as "giving in"
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:35:04
I subscribe to both, r/bitcoin definitely has more censorship (although r/btc could use a little moderation). I support segwit and a blocksize increase. I think a lot of btc people just can't get behind segwit because they see it as "giving in" to the core devs who "won't listen" to what a lot of users want, a small blocksize upgrade 
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:52:09
""Thoroughly rejected"" you got that from steadily rising hashrate?
@_date: 2019-11-03 06:40:16

@_date: 2017-08-08 00:47:23
They wouldn't sacrifice 3 months, they already sell most of the coin to cover operating costs, and they can still dump the coins before switching 
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:46:12
You should buy now then, otherwise it'll already be priced in 
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:25:49
The price is going up because people want it more than previously thought. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:21:33
The people who want both? Duh 
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:30:30
On the other hand it's real easy to get coke with BTC and that's the hard part. One of the best things to do coke with is a tampon tube. It's a funnel on one end and straw on the other, it's like it was designed for insuffilation 
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:04:15
I see I didn't think of that! It would definitely be a very sticky situation I dint even know how they would play out nothing like that has ever happened huh? Although if the miners do have incentive and they switch over it kind of forces everyone's hand right? 
@_date: 2019-02-12 00:33:49
Most block explorers track the float straight up, daily transactional volume is an extremely common metric
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:59:28
except they don't exactly take a lot less space, but they get counted as less artificially
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:01:12
This sub is shit

@_date: 2017-11-03 18:51:03
I think summed it up pretty well in his response but I'll reiterate


It doubles the transnational capacity!!! You might not agree with it, or think it's worth it, or any other host of problems but saying there are NO good arguments just shows your bias / unwillingness to engage in discussion.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:45:45
Lmao this is like one of those parody smear objects from arrested development 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:32:13

Do you know what revisionist means? It's a dishonest retelling of the past...
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:39:18
First not everyone does support that (see the other subreddit). Secondly while it's an effective increase in the size to be used for transactions it's not the same as a pure blocksize increase 
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:17:30
Did you read it? They signed the HK agreement which was segwit + increase in blocksize, the same agreement core later went back on. I honestly think the majority of both sides would be content with segwit - 2mb block size. Sadly it's been so politicized it's not really about the technical argument as much as who is "in power". :(
@_date: 2017-04-05 23:54:51
Why doesn't everyone run the overt version? To make the bitcoin network more energy efficient 
@_date: 2019-04-24 22:30:20


This is straight up dishonest. The sub started out from a difference in opinion on this sub, its always been about bitcoin though
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:18:43
In the blog post it says they support BIP that would patch this, the blog post outlines pretty clearly their thoughts on segwit 
@_date: 2018-11-14 04:51:39
It keeps halving and will take an infinite amount of time to get every last bit 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:01:18
He was never even charged for the alleged murder so yes there's a debate 
@_date: 2018-11-14 00:23:03
The last bitcoin will never be mined but I really do hope he has a secret stash somewhere
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:46:40
What a quality submission smh 
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:51:48
It does add security. More hash power added means an adversary would have a harder time 51% attacking your network
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:47:52
lol this is so obviously biased even if you didn't know anything about bitcoin you could tell. OP literally says in comments "yes this is very biased"
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:34:23
There are but they don't get posted here obviously lol
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:17:01
Because I'm waiting to see how everything shakes out. I didn't say I'm confident that 2x will be worth more, just that I support it personally 
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:09:03
I don't use bitfinex (or know what split you're talking about I'll admit) . Also I'm not betting my coins on either chain succeeding right away. While I do support it I realize there is controversy, and my preferred implementation might not give me the biggest financial gains
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:43:43
That's not the only reason. A lot of people want to see a larger blocksize / less power with Core. Every fork is not an attack... 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:36:48
I'm a long time hodlr (2012) and I strongly support S2X. Don't paint us all with the same brush

@_date: 2018-07-12 15:41:29
ah I guess in that case. Although I still don't think it's good in the long run, it is not sustainable
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:20:24
It's only an estimate, by looking at a short time frame you get more volitility 
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:00:00
Not sure how we arrived at blockchains but I am into it so I'll shoot. 
1. Centralization can be built on top of it, so average joe can keep using his bank / have the transactions reversed.
2. Being deflationary does encourage saving / discourage spending but that dosent necessarily mean the economy will collapse
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:28:09
So far nobody actually answering the question...
BCH ppl don't like big hubs because if the whole system relies on a few big hubs the hubs could start imposing rules (aka the system we have now). Basically fear of centralization yes. Whether this is founded or not remains to be seen 
@_date: 2018-04-30 21:39:02
lol 83% of market cap was sent in the last 24h? Seems legit
@_date: 2019-09-12 20:47:03
throughput does not change as a function of miners (or hash power)
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:34:27
No bias here... 
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:31:43
The scarcity is already there, the rate of increase is slowing down exponentially 
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:13:12
Agree. They obviously aren't using it overtly, there are people who would love to expose them if they were. Honestly it seems like using an efficiency boost isn't immoral anyways 
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:53:57
It's way less subtle than other noots
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:42:49
I think summed up the list of points nicely in the other thread 
Here is a collection of some beliefs:
- SW coins are different
- SW coins can be stolen due to the "anyonecanspend vulnerability"
- SW as soft fork is overly complex
- SW is a trojan horse by the current devs to stay in power
- SW adds 150% increase at a 400% cost
- SW is patented by Blockstream
- Blockstream wants to turn Bitcoin into CorperateCoin, which is ruled by AXA
- Blockstream wants to turn Bitcoin into a settlement layer, to sell 2nd layer products
- LN leads to centralized hubs run by Blockstream
- LN steals on-chain fees from the miners
- LN coins are not bitcoins
- LN doesn't work due to the lack of proper routing
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:45:08
I think you're talking about lightning network right? I don't like segwit as much as a straight increase but from my understanding it does increase capacity (although like I said above in a very inefficient way) 
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:31:57
It's traded as futures 
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:22:18
So he wins either way 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:17:06
Then it seems like an overreaction to call another increase a scam ya?
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:55:13
Well its built into the miners they sell so.... 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:18:00
It increases both, although the capacity increase is less than the block-size increase which is why some people don't like this solution
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:05:28
It's more complicated than that but either way, you're calling a small blocksize increase as a scam? Like even if you don't want it there's nothing about it that's like a scam? 
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:19:48
I think sums up the points pretty well. A significant amount of it is just politics (so not technical in nature) although there are some technical critiques as well. 
It's hard to get accurate information since BOTH sides have a ton of circlejerking / personal attacks / FUD / bullshit / stupidity 
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:31:56
Really it's a scam to raise the blocksize to 2Mb? Seems like a good compromise to me 
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:42:01
Exactly. I'm amazed OP doesn't recognize the irony of their post. "How can they disagree with me when everyone agrees...."Obviously not everyone agrees 
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:49:30
The futures are already worth about that 
@_date: 2017-07-06 04:10:52
It's a list of things people who disagree might vibe with. Personally I don't think the name calling and mud slinging helps anyone man 
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:14:39
the longer you hold out the less likely that there will be a reorg though. So it becomes a feedback loop making people not want to switch. (Not disagreeing with the other loop mentioned once people start switching, but this seems likely if they don't)
@_date: 2017-06-19 05:44:29
you can't rebuy for the same price, price would go up as you bought same way
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:17:45
Fear of missing out? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:00:33
that's one way to look at it. Another is to switch as soon as possible, so they can keep their profits in the case of a reorg. I don't think that will happen but it is worth considering.
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:45:10
Wouldnt you want to avoid a reorg and so as long as one was possible but unlikely you would keep your hashrate at the non-segwit side? 
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:58:30
First of all nobody knows what will happen. Secondly it can be hard to get the full picture in r/bitcoin or r/btc due to censoring and general mob mentality
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:55:50
I was going to say being hacked is a big deal if they're going to fork when it happens, otherwise you can't be confident in holding your coins 
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:33:02
If BIP148 goes along and then eventually it everyone decides to do something else then the transactions would dissappear right? 
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:18:27
Lol it's a pretty biased explanation, but yeah if you control your keys just sit tight 
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:20:02
I'm not sure you understand how git works. To create a pull request you have to fork a repo anyways. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:47:17
He's saying with that amount of money OP would be able to do that if he desired. Luckily it looks like all OP wants is his coins back
