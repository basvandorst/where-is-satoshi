I asked this exact question over at here are the answers: 
@_date: 2013-08-19 16:01:04
oh, so the transaction fees are summed somewhere inside the whole system and miners get an amount from it?
@_date: 2013-08-19 21:12:07
what if a really big company like google, ms, or apple gets so many pcs that they 'control' the network, is that possible/realistic, say in 5 years?
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:31:56

are you serious on 10,000% ROI? Could you give me an example of how ROI calculates? :-O

What happens if we hit the 21,000,000 BTC limit? Where do the rewards for miners come from?
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:02:59
