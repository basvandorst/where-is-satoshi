Can you elaborate what you mean by troll farms, and how does that relate to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:09:49
I haven’t given it a thought tbh - however I do think bitcoin or at least blockchain is the future, based on my narrow knowledge in the field. 
Troll farms is becoming more and more a thing to consider when opening your browser. I don’t think they account for much though.

Bitcoin made the American dream come true

I really hope this becomes reality for a lot of people - bitcoin has, as far as I know, made a lot of people gain some profit, that probably needs it more than those who all ready has gotten their share.

But when do you sell if you always hodl?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:40:35
I agree - the time to sell is soon, people scream hodl all the while considering selling out or at least portions of their coins.

I would love to work 80+ hours for a year or two for spacex, Tesla or some other company that really is improving our way of life, and taking humanity into a better future. Working 80+ hours for a bank to put some more money into the pockets of investors? Fuck of, I have one life and want to make damn sure I did something great for mankind, even if it will be hard as fuck. This is what Elon mush is doing, he is inspiring a generation to do better and work hard to get there.

How the hell are you able to hold your coins, if you see an opportunity to sell out and receive a few million dollars? 
At sell some of it and get a profit
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:41:22
I know, but I could use more dips :) 
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:36:52
If alts could take a dip again it would be nice

Hmm I get the logic. More wants more basically. As I see it, if you’ve made it so far until now, what should keep you from going even further? As long as you as an investor takes out some profit every now and then, I don’t see a problem in continuing and seeing your investments grow. 
But thanks for the elaboration it gives a great insight into the psychology of what happens when you hold, and success strikes.
