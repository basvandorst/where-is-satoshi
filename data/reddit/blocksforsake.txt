How do you know? The Chinese Government is putting restrictions on Capital Outflows. Speculation perhaps? You'll feel mighty silly soon.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:32:41
But it could never trade at these highs again. It's near impossible to exchange btc for cash on any major exchange. i.e. Realize capital gains for purpose of original investment and tax purposes. Legitimate businesses can't use BTC to pay taxes or fund projects... This ecosystem cannibalizes itself quickly when people suddenly realize that you're just waiting to sell your BTC an even bigger fool. The investor who had it first has the advantage. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:58:37
Exchanges in China are now very illiquid, so you'll probably be able to find a cheap trade and arbitrage. Goodluck getting actual cash though. Also the price difference could be made up by the time you're finally able to sell. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:55:03
Yes, they have a number of controversies, as there usually tends to be a bunch in the world of investments and money. Wouldn't think they know fraud when they see it? Pyramid schemes are illegal investments, so cryptos will be illegal soon as well. I'm pretty passionate because this shit has no intrinsic value and I spent three hours trying to put through in a low enough ask offer for a bid. I bought in early playing with the idea of exponential growth and realized this thing is unsustainable if you run out of people to keep buying it. 
Go on, keep being stupid. You'll look very silly soon. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:10:27
Sell dude! The Chinese have taken all the liquidity from the market. I think the recent strength in the Yuan and weakness in the USD is likely due to the recent pumping in price of BTC. The correlation from the start of January to now is too damn high. China is putting Capital controls up since too much of the Yuan was flowing out of the country! 
This has turned out to be a pyramid scheme, with older positions now being dumped. Hearing McAfee be a huge douchebag about how rich he is made me think this is all a scam. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:06:28
JP Morgan is a bank and they have Quorum. The bank doesn't believe money, capital, or any store of value can be digital, that's because they're a fucking bank. They deal in real, big money, not BTC. There are so many from JPM saying there are parallels between pyramid schemes and crypto markets. 
Dimon knows fraud when he sees it, he had his bank run into the law before. Don't think for a second that he doesn't know other fraud when he sees it. He'll never forget Worldcom, Enron, Madoff or Belfort either. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:24:03
USA doesn’t allow pyramid schemes and it’s not protected under free speech, remember internet mall? Governments will never give up their control of the money supply. Chinese people are trading Yuan for Yen and buying BTC.... Chinese Speculators are distorting the market. Your reasoning is faulty. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:01:45
They don't have a partnership with Ethereum, they have a technology called Quorum that is based on Ethereum.... also COMPLIANCE. They can't buy BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:27:08
This literally is basic tactics of trying to convince someone to join the pyramid scheme you're part of. "I invested in BTC and it changed my life because... x y z", then convincing someone to buy it so that you make money. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:31:34
You can easily exchange Yuan for Yen. There has recently been yen buying, look at the current spot rates. Yen is rising on the yuan, meaning the Chinese are buying up yen.... The largest trading volumes are coming from Japan, Chinese hedge funds can only buy bitcoin with yen now... duhhh
Also, you’re so full of shit calling Yen fiat a scam from inflation. Y’all had price deflation for decades, with prices deflating because of low inflation. I find it hard to believe that you’re Japanese if you don’t even remember that. The yen is one of the strongest currencies around and rarely suffers from inflation, just deflation...
I understand exactly what Bitcoin is, it’s a [Pyramid scheme]( with an artificial supply cap with outdated technology. Cryptocurrency and blockchain have a future in the financial system, Bitcoin will not.  Are you that dense to think this isn’t a speculative bubble that will blow up once buyers run out? It’s mainly leveraged positions that post no margin.
They are speculating.... I live in the US and inflation was less than 2% last quarter.... we’re not doing so hot. Prices don’t change that quickly when there is low inflation... but when there’s speculation? Hell yeah
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:12:15
Let’s be realistic, at those price levels there would be millions more BTC users and the BTC network would not be able handle those transaction loads, as it can only do 7 transaction per second. Transaction costs would be astronomical. Miners refuse to change the source code to improve scaling... transactions could take days or weeks... 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:50:53
What are you talking about? April 2016 onward is one big bull run.... 
Edit: Before those were just smaller bull runs. Compared to April 2016 onward... when was the last time BTC was below $500? It’s a lot of froth. Sure, it had some mini bear markets, but if you look at the price, it’s all part of one big bull run.... I’m not going to put in the effort to show numbers, there’s no way to value btc... 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:56:37
That’s really weird, last time I looked in September it was the US. Also cointelegraph and coindesk is propaganda, fyi

Do you not understand the concept of an investment bank? "Far more than a bank", no dude, it's just a bank with more financial services tagged on. Investment banks also have this wonderful thing called COMPLIANCE, which prevents them from taking undue risk. Only hedge funds are capable of buying into crypto. Look up Dodd-Frank! They are legally restricted from buying into a cryptocurrency. There is no way they would risk another 2008 downturn. The fraud charges and fines were for the 2008 crisis, not from recent events! If the CEO threatens to fire his traders for using it, that probably means there is no money going into it from them. Several of them have said it's a pyramid scheme too, i.e. those who got in early are profiting, while those at the top lose money. They aren't dumb enough to get in this late. These cryptos are classic pump and dump securities, the worst part is that it's very opaque and hard to get cash back. Literally everyone I know in investments is saying the same thing, since only the losers are buying in now, the people who are always late to the party. I feel hollow from my 380% HPR, this was too easy....
They have no reason to manipulate the market, they already have plenty of investments elsewhere. Plus Blackrock, the largest asset manager in the world, is planning on buying them. There is no way they would risk losing that kind of money just to get some crypto. 
Are you that thick to believe that members of the central banking system would buy into their rivals? The firms that are supposedly disrupting their businesses? No, they want it dead because its unregulated and fraudulent. Don't be so naive. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:35:22
It is fun to play around with, but would never recommend it to a client. I already sold all my crypto once I realized it was a scam. Took awhile to find someone that would pay me cash for it. 
I'm an asset manager at an investment bank (the people who have fire walls put up around them so they don't accidentally receive inside information). I don't get 0.01% returns at JPM savings either, but I know when something is too good to be true. I'm just trying to warn people, as I have been doing. I'll stick with my real 10%-30% yearly instead. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:38:42
The question is, why sell your bitcoin when you can just wait and buy something of value. Long term Fiat devalues over time.
Here are a number of companies you can buy things with Bitcoin at:
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:46:46
I'm saying bad things about BTC because it's a fraud. I bought in at around $1000 and sold around $4800. I don't care if the prices go up or down, this is a scheme to get some poor sucker to buy something of little value. The only ones who win are at the bottom, and they have the most control over the market. The higher you buy, the less impact you have on the market. 
I'm for sure not a roach. I'm never buying this crap again. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:16:34
What regulator? Governments haven’t trued to crush it yet. In all honesty, I know Bitcoin is a bubble, but keep the party going while it lasts. Buy low sell high. 
If someone is foolish enough to buy it at $5000, then you’ll probably find it a good buy below $4000. Look at the dip as a buying opportunity. Think of the different $1000 marks as psychological barriers. When a coin reaches one, and starts bouncing around, it’ll probably rally. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:17:40
I give it another two months before a big regulator (Japan or US) cracks down on this. If you sell, you reap profits, then reenter lower. Keep the party going while it lasts.

Likely it would increase the price of silver but silver isn’t valued the same as gold. 50% of its price is driven by industrial use. Unsure of it’s market cap because it’s not as scarce and I can’t find any estimates anywhere. Precious metals don’t have an exact price really, there are only estimates since most of the trading happens OTC. Something BTC struggles to do. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:42:58
No, that's not even true. The market capitalization of gold is an estimated $7,851,219,628,277. To think that Bitcoin is even affecting it is ridiculous.
Edit: For context bitcoin, as of now, is only 1.03% the size of the gold market...
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:20:24

I lurk on most of the finance subreddits and this subreddit. Though I don't think BTC will go away anytime soon, it's clearly over inflated with leveraged positions that post no margin. Also there's less liquidity in the market than in August and September...
Edit: I bought bitcoin with a credit card at $1900 and sold at $4800 to pay back the loan and reaped profits. Some sucker gave me free money.

It’s not arbitrary. The smart money was in btc when it first came out. The dumb money, people like you, are getting in late.
Start from April 2016, when the bull run starts, it’s trending upward volatility...
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:09:06
What you said right there is what regular people call speculation. Governments will never give up their monopoly of the money supply. There are to things certain in life, death and taxes, bitcoin helps you try to avoid one of those. Art isn’t a waste of money. Literally one of the best alternative assets ever. This was on R/all buddy.
Edit: There is no justification for btc’s price. No way to value it. We’re already at fourth generation cryptos with better tech. This is more like 2000 at the height of the dotcom bubble. Bless blockchain. Bless Cryptocurrency. Idk what to say about BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:20:38
Hey man, I don’t mean to make a fool out of you, but that chart doesn’t measure volatility, more like skewed data...  Click on one year time frame, it’s pretty obvious.

Seems contradictory. Do people like you have fun making up stories about other more successful people? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:15:14
I think it’s Chinese Speculators (trading yuan for yen, check the current spot, Yuan is falling against the yen, meaning they're buying yen, selling yuan), american hedge funds that post no margin, and chinese hedge funds that post no margin (now trading Yuan for Yen), buying up BTC for god knows what reason, plus other speculators who are afraid of missing out. Get your popcorn ready, BTC will be visited by the bear soon. 
Edit: Grammar
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:37:59
I then find it hard to believe you live in Japan and don’t know about Japan’s deflation... and the strong yen. The Chinese have loosened capital controls in September if you keep up with finance, like me, an Investment Analyst... They want the Yuan weak. You just sound uneducated

Bitcoin death won’t be the death of crypto. There is nothing special about BTC. You can’t live off bitcoin, because how are you gonna pay taxes? In real currency. 
There also isn’t that much liquidity... especially during bear markets. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:20:46
That is your opinion, which is fine. You named the stock with the largest market cap in the entire S&amp;P 500... so maybe your current method for research is likely misguided. I think it’s really hard to generalize the entire stock market based off Apple. Stocks with good valuations don’t have to be laggards, likely they are just less researched by professional analysts. If all stocks were fully and correctly priced, I wouldn’t be able to continue arbitraging assets that are less researched (which can be a day, a week, or a month before a correction in price is made). Try small cap or mid cap stocks, which are usually less researched across the board. 
Because I think it’s a net good to help the public understand markets, I suggest you use ratios and figures in tandem for screening criteria, such as P/E, PEG, Market to Book, Dividend Yield, Current ratios, and positive operating cashflows. Using these together can help you determine a good valuation, but knowing what values are “good” may require some knowledge of finance and is up for you to decide. My own investment criteria is very particular, which is why I’m paid to do what I do. Hell, I recently made a pretty penny on stocks mentioned on subreddits, such as HMNY and TRXC. However, I was in before people started talking about them, and exited rather early once my price target was hit.
Tl;dr: go the opposite direction of where the money is flowing. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:13:47
Have you looked at volumes lately? Or the people buying it? The answer is not really that many new people are getting in. A lot of money is pouring in from leveraged positions that post no margin... hedge funds mainly. Most individual users don’t have enough purchasing power to really increase the market price. You mean people are speculating how high it can go... but you forget to realize older users make more money by adding new users, i.e. pyramid scheme. It’s only a matter of time before US regulators shut things down... 
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:02:23
$100x100=$10,000... sorry, I’m a numbers kind of guy.
$100-$2000 seems reasonable based on the growing size of the small BTC economy. Over $5000 seems a little ridiculous for outdated crypto technology that has problems scaling to large amounts of transactions. Also from several conversations with BTC buyers, it screams bubble imo... which is why I exited the market at $4800. Also several industry surveys for investors have come out saying the consensus opinion is that BTC is a crowded market, if not the most crowded.
I’m an Investment Analyst that functions as an asset manager at an investment bank (my peers and I manage a smaller portion of  investable funds while my boss (a senior VP) manages the big money). As a Libertarian, BTC seemed appealing, so I flirted with BTC for a short-time as an investment opportunity and thought of pitches for BTC at work... but my research pointed to a speculative bubble that could go higher or collapse at any moment... so instead I gave a presentation on why our assets should not be allocated to BTC, and possibly exploring other options in the crypto market. My boss and I made a bet for fun, guessing when the bubble would collapse, my guess was by the end of 2017. His guess was sometime in 2018, since he thinks the US government will eventually crush BTC, but the US federal agencies tend to be slow to regulate some markets, especially with the current administration.
In my opinion, a crypto backed by the full power of a developed government or real assets of an organization. I don’t think BTC is the future, but other cryptos have the potential to be. I’m just watching from the sidelines at this point. So I’ll stfu.

@_date: 2017-10-13 01:31:04
Yes, I have, and recently did a presentation on it. The trend for volatility is higher and higher since the start of this bull market. If you’re comparing it to several years ago, then it’ll look smaller in comparison.

@_date: 2017-10-13 15:07:33
Definitely not a noob, but okay. Regulators can destroy BTC, this is what we saw with China. Miners are starting to shutdown too. Get ready for the death of btc. Sell when everyone else is buying, buy once everyone is done selling.... That's how you trade any asset! Buy low sell high.

@_date: 2017-10-18 19:35:45
I don’t think the stock market is in a bubble, especially if you look at the fundamentals of individual companies. I think there are mainly mini bubbles that have formed around big brand tech companies that many people are speculating on, so an investor can just avoid them... 
If you look at the S&amp;P 500 index as a whole, it may appear that the market is overvalued... but the index tends to overweight overvalued stocks, and underweight undervalued stocks. It’s all about perspective. 
BTC is just too volatile to hedge against the market, as we have no indicator how it will react when under economic stress. Silver, not so much because 50% of its price is dependent on industrial use. Gold is good since it is used to back hard currencies, even though it has little industrial use. Monero definitely seems appealing along with other cryptos, but they’re speculative markets. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:44:44

It’s kind of hard to measure since it’s a commodity that’s largely traded OTC so no one really knows... it’s what backs hard currencies and has a history of thousands of years in human society.
However, on the London Metal Exchange, we can estimate some of the formal trading that takes place. On October 3 , the most busy day for gold this month was 9576 lots traded, which is 100 oz. per lot. A 100 oz. piece of gold costs  $130,200. My estimate is then (9576x$130,200)=$1,246,795,200 trading volume. That’s more than you’ll see on a single btc exchange.
LME is only a fraction of the gold trading that takes place daily. You can find more on their website.

Stocks can be [shorted]( allowing for price discovery. They subscribe to an underlying value, or expected value, of a company. If you bought it undervalued, or invested early, you are rewarded more with real money, often in the form of buybacks or dividends, from the money made in a company’s operations. 
Edit: The company is actually creating value, often with a physical good or service. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:39:34

Blockchain is good because it has helped database management become easier and more reliable. I’m a former management consultant... the benefits of blockchain reached that field back in 2010... but you probably didn’t know that. 
My belief for Bitcoin was that it was the first established crypto, and had utility for those on the dark web, groups that always work in cash. This gave the coins liquidity that would always be available to other market participants, because they had no other option to trade with. Monero is now their currency of choice, so what is the point of Bitcoin besides speculation? 
Bitcoin is not worldwide accepted. Russia is banning it. China banned domestic access. Japan and South Korea do not actually accept it as legal tender.... they labeled it as an asset class. Japan and Russia are both launching their own cryptos. 
JP Morgan is international. 
The US doesn’t put huge restrictions on currency. All governments want to know where their currency is going and who has it. Russia has US dollar currency reserves so you’re wrong.... 
You can’t have thought about the parallels between bitcoin and pyramid schemes? No one want to be at the bottom of that pyramid. Remember internet mall? 
Your comparison to the 90s is unfounded. Bitcoin was introduced in 2009..... that’s a fair comparison. This is more like 2000 when all the different companies decided to join in and led to the first competitors eventually fell apart. Bitcoin is like Napster and Ethereum is like Google. Facebook came out in 2004 so not a good comparison.

Get ready my man, the bear gonna come chomping. If you can reap profits now, this would be the time. It’ll probably come flying down soon because of regular volatility, so you can wait for a reentry point. Buy low sell high
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:43:40
You mean the risk gets higher as the price gets higher... The volatility of Bitcoin continues to get higher and higher with every bear market. If you bought earlier, then sure your gains could still be intact, but if you bought between $3000 and now, you might get screwed.
Edit: Maybe some people don’t realize this, but people are buying BTC on leverage and posting no margin. That’s dangerous.

History in the making is why I follow r/Bitcoin. Got my popcorn ready

Chinese Speculators and Hedge Funds.
I think the Chinese are buying Yen and in turn, buying more BTC, if you compare current exchange rates. 
Also lot of hedge funds buying in on leverage with no margin. BTC is going insane right now and it’s kind of scary.

Other governments monitor currency levels of China. The strength of the currency relies on the foreign exchange reserves of the Chinese government. They don’t really need to print more money to weaken their currency.

You used a youtube video to argue?? Lol I’m done. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:16:59
Nah dude, I’ll say the bubble’s popped when it hits $500 or $0. I bought in at $1900 with a credit card (posting no margin) and sold at $4800. But hey, easy money. 
Also it appears a lot Chinese Traders are speculating right now, which is probably why there had been such an inflow of yen into BTC, since they have to buy yen to buy BTC now. This would explain why the Yen has recently strengthened on Yuan. Metals prices are distorted too...

Sell it. Reap your profits. You still technically lost $80 until you’ve sold. It’s only worth as much as you can get someone else to pay for it. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:28:35
Market Cap on BTC looks to be a little over $57 billion in that picture. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:03:18
You gotta get out of the bubble first though, since  you just gave $4800 to some random person. Now you gotta sell it higher to another random person!!!
Edit: This is how you make money off speculative bubbles. If I did it super easily, so can other people. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:32:23
Except that this resulted from hyperinflation of a corrupt government. Reserve currencies don't experience this type of inflation.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:22:37
I think a crypto backed by real assets could be the future. A real unbeatable ledger that’s private... but I can only dream of that day.
I think a regulator is going to come down hard on BTC soon. Get ready for the pyramid collapse! 
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:46:09
Coinbase doesn't allow you to sell bitcoin for USD... I know because I tried to sell it there. They don't have enough liquidity to be an actual exchange. 
Edit: I see now that Coinbase allows you to sell up to $10,000 of BTC... This was not the case before the last bear market when I tried to sell. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:45:31
Blockchain, not BTC. Blockchain is the future, not BTC.

Yes, money is a tool for exchange... Governments use currency to administer exchange... They say, this is your legal tender, this is what you pay taxes with, you have to accept it if you do business here. Governments protect their currency with interest rates or trading it. Bitcoin loses its value as soon as it runs out of buyers. 
Can I use Bitcoin to buy things not on the internet? No, I can’t. Gold can be traded over the counter to nearly anyone. Drug dealers don’t use Bitcoin anymore.... In the US money, is inflated so that younger populations and poorer can attain wealth, it grows as the economy grows. If money worked how Bitcoin is working, older users would be infinitely more wealthy than younger folks. 
Bitcoin’s price is overinflated man. It’s just bits on a computer. There’s no difference between other bits on a computer. 
Trading currencies is actually very easy... go to a goddamn bank or exchange... the paperwork is dependent on the dealer. 
You’ll never have a problem with government if you keep cash... 
People on the darkweb markets don’t really use BTC anymore because it’s not that private. Monero dominates those markets. 
As an American, I can have bank account in other countries without being a resident. Ever heard of the Swiss National Bank? 
Edit: Why is Bitcoin so special compared to other cryptos? Why do these particular bits on a computer have to be worth more than other bits on a computer? 
FYI, I rode part of this bubble because I didn’t think it would collapse, yet... but a number of regulators are taking notice. I did it all on leverage with no margin and then sold. Many people are doing the same, which pushes up the price. However one Uncle Sam comes knocking, the party is over. You gotta have that mindset if you’re trading Bitcoin, or you’re going to get burnt. 
Edit 2: Think really hard about pyramid schemes man... because you don’t seem know how those work.

There is only 1.3 trillion US dollars in circulation... Why would Indians want to buy an expensive outdated crypto? I’ve thought of the upside, there isn’t much. Bitcoin relies on the fact that people are willing to buy it at a price. As soon as it runs out of buyers, the price drops off, you realize that, right? It’s all about liquidity. If you can’t liquidate, then you’re fucked. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:19:39
So the largest market for Bitcoin won’t cause this whole thing to come crashing down? Great logic. You know the US makes up almost the entire BTC market, right? 
Edit:What’s to stop a crypto backed by real assets to stop BTC in it’s tracks? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:29:44
That’s still a forward contract... smh... you’re just giving your money away.. the market maker could shut down at anytime. 
Edit: I mean futures. You can’t customize it. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:31:04
I know you’re being sarcastic, but the forks are literally just changing the source code. None seem to have worked so far. You have to get all the miners to agree to an update before changing source code. Some coins may be lost forever too. Democratization and decentralization of a monetary system has its drawbacks.  
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:57:43
Indeed! I wish plenty of gains for you! Just remember to sell high and buy low!

Pyramid schemes occur when there are multiple levels of investment... users are rewarded for adding new users. The oldest users profit as more and more users put in money. Ultimately, the older users have the most control. These models often ascribe to exponential growth, or “to the moon.”  Resorting to name calling because I’m right doesn’t make you right haha. Most Bitcoin news is paid advertising, ever noticed that? 
Edit: Prove how BTC isn’t a bubble? Prove that it isn’t a pyramid scheme?

Implementation of arbitrage isn't low risk, it's fundamentally risky. There is no guarantee that the price will adjust quickly...markets may remain “irrational” longer than the arbitrager can hold out.  Then there's implementation cost - arbitrage requires short selling and not everything can be shorted…even if a short is available it is difficult to remain short for long periods. Finally arbitrage is usually based on a model... is that model correct? 
 
Also Dollar-Cost Averaging over a period of ten months is very risky, that's an extremely short investment horizon. You should be dollar costing over 20 years into something that you know will exist during that time period, like a stock market index fund. The longer the investment horizon, the better.

No, that’s wrong man. It used to be the largest market. China had about 20% of the total market share up until the exchange ban, now it’s probably close to zero... 
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:00:34
Pulverized? That's actually kind of dumb.
Finance is not an exact science and has a long history of people getting overexcited at each new hot thing. The sexy Junk Bonds of the 80s. The internet stocks of the 90s. It takes a real "group thinker" or follower to not see it's the same thing with Bitcoin. 
How many people do you think said the same exact thing as you before every market crash, recession, and depression? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:23:25
Finance is a mix of science and behavior study, so it's an art. Like medicine, it requires skill and instinct to be successful. 
Price isn't a continuous function. History loves to repeat itself. Bitcoin is subject to frequent market crashes. It may be around for awhile, but $1600 is really not feasible, as we saw that it shaved about $100 as soon as it reached that mark... 
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:27:08
The picture should be going the other way... If a price gets that high this quickly, it might be a good idea to short...  Bearish markets follow bullish ones.
"Irrational Exuberance"  is what people in finance call this. Meaning, y'all mutha fuckers are crazy.
