If you can ever get authorised/verified at cadvirtex - over 1 week later, my status is still in 'Pending'
On the other hand VoS took 1 hour to verify me.
Also a 5$ fee for a bill payment that takes DAYS to complete. not especially convenient in the volatile BTC market

I can't say enough good things about VoS. For the quickest deposit method: Just Email the site Let them know your plans (remember to include your VoS Account  , they will send you bank information. Go to BMO with this info, and tell them you want to deposit Cash into this account. No charges, and you don't need a BMO account. - The only thing to remember, VoS uses a US currency account with BMO, so the bank will need to convert and then deposit the US$. You will be given 2 receipts, One for the US conversion, and another for the actual Deposit into the VoS business account.
Takes about 10 minutes for this process in the Bank. VoS will spot your payment, or you can send them a folllow up email with a picture of your deposit receipt if you wish.  And, in my experience - 20 minutes or sooner later, you will have the money at VoS ready to buy some magical internet currency!
So for under an hour you can have a significant amount of bitcoins in your account rather than Days of waiting through bill payments and wire transfers blah.

Agreed, I recently deposited some cash, there are no fee's involved. the CAD$ was in my vault of satoshi account within 20 minutes. The only negative is that VoS has a BMO Business account in USD - so you loose a tiny amount at the banks cost of converting to USD

Yep, They are absolutely fantastic. Prompt Verification. Quick at replying to email questions.  The same could not be said for Cavirtex. over 1 week and i am still not verified. Not that it matters, I wont be using them now. I just wish that i found VoS sooner!!

Send money to a friend in canada, and have them make a cash deposit at BMO for for you into VoS's account.
