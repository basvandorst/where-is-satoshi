Yeah, for sure. It helps to keep the front page free from being nothing but price spam.

Around 8:10 they talk about interest rate curves. I'm extremely interested to see what the 5 and 10-year yields look like for bitcoin lending.

Dude, what the fuck, go walk your dog again.

I went to the ATM launch a few days ago. I think a widespread adoption of these things will let a lot of people who didn't want to go through exchanges a way to get coins. I see this as being good for bitcoin in general.

Exactly, tx fees aren't that big of a factor if you are willing to wait 12-24 hours for confirmation.

Got a friend to finally buy some btc a few nights ago. He's already up 15%.

See, you know this one is true, because the blockchain is proven to keep bread from going bad in a freezer.

I sent a 2 sat/b tx last night and it was confirmed by the time I woke up this morning.

Never has the CAD/USD exchange rate made me happier. 
That price (11k on CEX) means $14k CAD/BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:55:04
It's looking like we will be breaking $11k before December.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:38:01
The 10K and 11K posts are going to be on r/all at the same time. That is going to create an insane bull market of people that will probably crash a few exchanges.
edit: guys I jinxed it.

You never want to store your bitcoin on an exchange, as this will leave you at risk if something happens to the company that runs the exchange. Keeping your coins in a wallet where you control the private keys is very important.
I personally am trying to buy more bitcoin before the upcoming fork. After the fork I will be able to sell the new altcoin for more bitcoin.

You totally could use a fully upgraded diamond pick axe, which is what I did. The server even had a exp farming chamber so you could always keep your diamond pick from breaking. However, each type of block rewarded a number of satoshi based on how long it took to mine it. So 30 seconds of mining netherrack would reward the same as 30 seconds mining stone, wood, or any other block. I think diamond blocks did reward 10x the satoshi though.
You'd earn BTC faster by placing blocks however, so I ended up with a giant pit mine, and whenever my inventory was full I would add blocks to a giant cube I was making. By the end I had something like a 50x50x50 solid cube, with a 3d representation of a tesseract on top.
I earned around 0.1 BTC "mining" this way. Nothing huge, but considering I got that in a few weeks of playing minecraft it isn't too shabby.

Years ago I was playing minecraft on a server that would pay ~10 satoshi per block mined/placed. At the time I was making $1-$2 per hour. The original plan was to hold until it was the equivalent of having earned minimum wage. If BTC reaches ~$5000 CAD I'll reach that point. However, at this point I have no desire to sell until BTC goes high enough where John Mcafee won't have to eat his own dick.

 is one of the only ones that pays more than 20 satoshis

The waving means that the value of Bitcoin has gone up again

So true, they could have just said "Over 6 Million" and the result would be the same.
