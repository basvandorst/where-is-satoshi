Charts will show you volume relative to that coin's past, and usually bigger volume means more significant sentiment. Price is like a number that reflects raw sentiment. I think that the selloff was not "because" of fees or bcash or china or any one thing. When something goes sharply up, it must then correct. I think that the bounce back has not been as quick as it has been in the past because of aforementioned factors. BTC will keep going up, I think some alts will go up faster (higher %)

I don't recommend this with BTC, the fees will eat most of the gift unless it's a very generous gift

Yes, but it gave the same opportunity to the masses of individual investors ... we just probably didn't play it quite as well. Regardless I don't see institutions having the kind of price-manipulation power that they have in traditional markets because there are SO many other players, and I see this effect only getting stronger as the cryptoverse grows

Sending coinbase -&gt; coinbase as a gift just seems weird to me...three yrs ago I put BTC on a physical coin wallet made by denarium. Subsequent years I've used paper wallets. It's nice to be able to give someone the complete gift and get them used to the idea of using their wallet, not just loop them into coinbase where they'll likely never take control of the money. Putting BTC on a paper wallet is unfeasible this year so I've opted for a different coin for xmas gifts

8mb really doesn't, since the block chain is still under 200gb. I think the argument is that infinite block scaling could eventually lead to individuals being unable to run full nodes. I think it's kind of a joke since you can get a 1tb hdd for $40 rn and that's only going down...

No worries, happy to help you get started. Once you buy on coinbase your coins will be sitting on THEIR wallet (which you have access to). You want them on YOUR wallet. It's easy enough to send from coinbase to wherever you want. So set up a wallet, whether that's a hardward wallet, paper wallet, encrypted desktop wallet, or phone wallet (ordered from most secure to least). Any wallet you create will have a 'public key' which is the address that you send the coins to. Initiate a send of a test amount, a small amount of coin, and check back the next day to see if it went through. BTC is slow and costly to send, so it's ideal to not move it around too much. Cheers and reach out if you need anything

Welcome to the future! And the future is now. As a new long term investor I would recommend that you don't worry about price, especially don't make decisions based on it. You may see the price drop after a few weeks, but just buy in more. Your strategy of investing incrementally is called 'dollar-cost average' and is one of the best ways to enter a market that's generally trending up (as long as you keep your perspective in the long term). Best of luck and have fun
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:50:13
On coinbase use 'send' feature then paste in your BTC address from wallet

The fact is we live in a universe where meditation can cure terminal cancer. Why look for "facts" when evil prevails as a ruling body and our environment is on the brink. Science hasn't really helped... Helped some hurt some. You see how silly this is, asking me for scientific evidence? I won't go digging through dead information to satisfy you. I don't have time. Your anger and fear have gotten the better of you, you think reason and logic are the key to the way out. This is the core of our fundamental disagreement

His views are in opposition to "god" as referring to a singular deity ... the old man with a white beard who ejaculated the universe one day and still calls all the shots. Hawkings is anti - theist, he is against this belief. Great and good for him. However, this is not a relevant or useful interpretation of the concept of "god." Of fucking course there's no old man. What he hopes mankind's knowledge and intellect will someday encompass, would be an understanding of "god" or of the universe and how it works. INsight into the nature of god is what spawned religions. Direct understanding through consciousness, not dissection through intellect. Sages of old then tried to communicate the wisdom of these understandings, and what ensued has been a massive game of telephone by people who, largely, have no direct insight or understanding of god. That's why religions tend to be useless. But their original formation points to the inherent all-knowledge we all have access to. WITHOUT the need for costly and dangerous "tools" of science

Does it bother you that what science calls "facts" are continually proven to be wrong over time? Don't you think this will keep happening? A very interesting character is Wim Hoff, "The Iceman," who has been able to influence his autonomic nervous system, something science claims is beyond our mortal control, through meditation and breathing. And now he's having these science geeks study him while he does his thing, so they can "prove" it to themselves. The method of a scientist is to continually prove themselves wrong, and tamper with everything along the way. I don't think this is sustainable

It's funny to me how hard you try and pin me as a "pseudoscientist" in opposition to your "science," the same way that fool hawkings is an "atheist" again "theists." It's this divisive, compartmentalized thinking that is the problem. I'm not sure why you're demanding that I go and look through your scientific journals, that's sounds boring. I don't recommend that you meditate, cause that's a waste of my time. I'm done here, be well bye bye

I agree, his stance serviced the majority like any good celebrity.
"Of course nobody has understanding of God as there is no reason to believe such entity exists" here I'm using the word "god" to refer to the universe and it's rules, a usage that I find more engaging than the 'entity' view. An entity lives and dies, abides by linear time in our mind's eye, while the universe does not
"'all-knowledge we all have access to.' - You lost me here.. Please explain" inside our dna is the code not only to develop from single celled organisms into fully conscious beings, but lots of other wisdom as well. One might even call it god-like knowledge, omniscience, dev console. Expressed routinely as 'instinct' and accessible through heightened states... Near death experience, psychedelics, tantra, breathing, chanting, dance, asceticism, etc. Probably states Mr hawking found himself in often due to his continual proximity to his own mortality. I'd refer you to graham hancock for further reading on the dna subject.
