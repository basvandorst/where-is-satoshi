You can push for something all day, but that doesn't mean it'll be cost effective enough to merit construction. Scrypt is very memory-intensive, so a piece of custom hardware will either have to be very expensive (lots of RAM) or not as fast. Not having both speed and cost-efficiency is a dealbreaker for a cryptocoin ASIC.

Bingo. Chargeback fraud by card owners is less than half the problem. Stolen cards being used to buy tons of btc, followed by the legit card holder filing a dispute is the biggest problem, imo. Depending on how the processors work, they'll either claw back the money or simply blacklist you (or both). 
I think you are going to see what looks like spectacular success for tinkercoin, followed by a brilliant conflagration as it collapses in a pile of smoldering cinders.
Sure, massive markup sounds like it will save you, but that only goes so far if the chargeback rate is sky high, or your rate of fraud is higher than the markup. 
Don't underestimate the black market's appetite for laundering the value of stolen credit cards.

Sorry, friend, but you are simply not understanding. In the quote you pasted, "customers' deposits" refer to the total value of customer accounts the bank owes them, should they try to withdraw. The bank holds less in liquid assets than the total of their customers' assets. 
The reason this ever works is because most bank customers don't need to withdraw all of their funds at the same time. When they do, you get a bank run, which can cause a major crash. It's how the Great Depression happened, and it's what caused major economic collapses much more recently in Greece.

Perhaps you aren't from the United States or don't follow sports much. If that's the case, let me fill you in:
College sports, football in particular, are incredibly popular in the States. It's a huge business that pulls in tons of viewers during bowl season (which just wrapped up on 1/6). Major bowls are obviously more popular than whatever the bitcoin bowl would be, but people love having bowl games to watch when the big BCS games aren't on yet. 
Not to mention alumni from the 2 schools playing tend to follow their alma mater's sports team if they are fans of the sport at all.

Sure it can. If I open BitBank and try to do FRB, all I need to do is tell you your total deposits are worth 100BTC, but that's not 100BTC in a wallet on the blockchain. 
FRB was done before the end of the gold standard. FRB against bitcoin would be no different than FRB against a gold-backed USD. 
Hell, I'm pretty sure Mt. Gox is operating with a fractional reserve right now.

And people wonder why there's been an appetite for altcoins using scrypt, like litecoin. It's very difficult to create ASICs for such a memory-intensive algorithm, which keeps the network democratized to a higher degree, since GPU mining is still king. 
The average hobbyist can just mine with their PC while idle or buy some standard consumer computer parts and build a miner that's not an absolute waste of time and money, and the parts are useful for non-mining if the currency becomes unprofitable. 
This keeps the network more decentralized as long as everyone doesn't gravitate to the largest pools. A few are quite large, but none are really pushing the 51% danger zone. The biggest is at ~27% at time of posting.

If by "like candy" you mean at least 2 years apart when my mobile contract subsidizes a new one, then sure. I've tried all 3 types because I'm not a rabid fan and wanted to try then. None has cost me more than $99 with contract.Again, I'm no Apple loyalist, but can you honestly say Google or Microsoft are dramatically better companies?There's no "benefit of the doubt" needed. Apple is always very conservative with anything slightly controversial from a legal perspective when it comes to app approvals. We may not agree with their position, but that's the track record.Apple hasn't blocked Google Wallet or Paypal apps, so it's not like it's obviously anticompetitive behavior, as they have allowed frankly larger threats than bitcoin onto their platform.

The network is more spread out, so it's more likely to stay more distributed vs. clumping up like BTC sometimes seems to do. 
LTC isn't *immune* to oversized pools by any means, it's just not as naturally ... clumpy? ... as BTC's network tends to be. 
WeMineLTC is the largest LTC pool with ~27% at time of posting, so it's not a non-problem if they start growing. Last time they got really big, though, they closed enrollment to prevent oversize. One of the other large LTC pools did that very recently, too, because they were getting a bit too large. 
LTC ASICs have been "in the works" for quite a long time, and it's all been vaporware thus far. See my reply to for my thoughts on that.

The fact that:

2) it nearly happened again with GHash.IO  
3) It's not a virtual impossibility enforced by some (dis)incentive structure of code limitation  
mean it's certainly easy enough to be a legitimate fear. Scrypt-based coins aren't immune to oversized pools, but it seems like they tend to stay more distributed due to the more dispersed mining network.

It definitely has hit $1,200. While that was on Mt. Gox, it was decidedly before it shut down withdraws. In December, using Mt. Gox price was sort of the standard people quoted. You could have done plenty of transactions at that price in and out of Gox.   
It also fell as low as $130 on Mt. Gox, but *that number was retarded to quote* due to them locking down BTC withdraw.
tl;dr: The $1200 price quote was fine, but $130 is an invalid quote.

I don't think young people are the ones that are going to be hard to convince. It's their parents and grandparents who have no confidence in cryptography or technology b/c, to them, simple stuff like email and surfing is troublesome. These are the same people who have 8 toolbars in IE7 on their computer. From their perspective, it's far too difficult, too risky (they are constantly inundated by stories about hackers on the news, and if BTC picks up adoption, that will accelerate), and isn't going to ever be easy enough to use compared to other payment and value-storing mechanisms they have today.

Well, they *could* build that technology, but they chose not to because there's not enough value in a Sony TV vs. other brands to make customers accept that restriction to gain the other value. 
Consumers of Apple products do feel that their phones and tablets bring enough value that the app store's limitations are acceptable in order to access said benefits. 
It's really not comparable. 
Besides, the walled-garden vs. wild-west debate has existed regarding curated stores like this long before bitcoin was popular. There's enough merit on both sides that rational people can disagree on which is a superior strategy. 
At the end of the day, Apple has put out a product line and service with pretty clear terms. They don't owe you any functionality they didn't promise or have explicitly stated you aren't entitled to when you click "I accept". If you disagree with their terms, I encourage you to get an Android or Windows phone. Android is totally wild-west with their store, and Windows seems to have a less strict wall around their garden. There are plenty of fine handsets running both of those OSes.

I disagree. As a developer, the initial batch of btc could have been treated like test data and dumped.

It's silly, reductionist shit like this that prevent you from being taken seriously. Sure, there are plenty of herd-followers, but as many if not more are rational people who decided they like the product and services provided better than the competitors'. I've known plenty of people who have switched from android or widows to apple because they decided it was a better experience. 
I personally own a Nokia Lumia 920 (Windows Phone 8), and I've owned an old flavor of Android and owned iPhone before it. Being in the unique position of having owned all 3 with no predisposition toward the Apple/Mac ecosystem on the PC side (all windows machines in my home), I can totally understand someone having a preference for iPhone. It's not a bad device, and the app store has a very robust ecosystem. I have my qualms with the OS, but it's not utterly garbage, like some of the highly carrier-muddled android flavors some manufacturers turn out.
When it came time to buy a tablet, I picked up an iPad over the android and windows 8 offerings available at that time. Since then, we have also bought a smaller Android tablet and it's quite nice as well. Both get a lot of love in our home.
Personally, after this phone contract expires and I'm up for a new handset, I'll probably get an Android device, but that's just what I'm most interested in right now. It has nothing to do with cryptocurrency. 
I'm so over the religious wars about mobile OSes. Sure, Jobs was a fucking asshole and the company he left behind is not any better, but you can't tell me with a straight face that Google is some benevolent force seeking nothing but consumer joy. Apple's competitors are no less profit-driven than they are. The entire issue with bitcoin likely boils down to Apple being more cautious about legal standing of the apps in their store vs. Google's laissez faire approach.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:38:25
The question, of course, is cost efficiency. If you can't make an ASIC that's dramatically better than a miner made of PC parts, it won't ever be cost effective enough to merit purchasing/manufacturing them. If they are equivalent, I'd always buy PC parts due to versatility and resellability. 
While I'm not a hardware developer, I am a software developer, so my technical chops are not specialized enough to give a breakdown of the effectiveness of CAM for scrypt, but I don't see why it would matter. The part about scrypt that's memory-hard is the raw amount of on-the-fly psuedorandom data that's computed. You either store the whole thing in memory (memory expensive, time fast) or compute and use onesy-twosey (memory cheap, time expensive). I'm not sure what CAM wins you, there.
Scrypt ASICs have "been in development" since the earliest days of LTC's prominence and BTC's ASIC explosion. Thus far, it's all been vaporware.

BTC is a speculation market right now. In your financial situation, you shouldn't spend a fucking dime on BTC. Follow it out of interest or earn some for doing freelance work if you choose to be paid in it (which is as good as cash wtaking money under the table), but do not be that guy who takes out a second mortgage to buy more BTC only to see it plummet. 
The existing financial markets will be plenty healthy for you to work through them and manage your education debt.

@_date: 2015-05-03 04:45:26
While technically correct, I think the point is trying to make is this: nobody can tell you how much a loaf of bread or a beer costs in BTC. They can convert to {local fiat} and tell you after doing some remedial math, but virtually nobody is doing business in BTC with most of their life-essential transactions. BTC is still a second class citizen in that regard. Sure, I might find an obscure website that can mail me some junk beer for BTC or maybe a vendor who took &lt;=16 man hours to add BitPay as a payment vehicle, but people aren't using BTC outside of speculation, drugs, or highly internet-centric purchases (like VPNs). 
Like it or not, BTC is, at best, a speculative vehicle that is tracked based on how much fiat it's worth, not how much product you can buy with it. That might change one day, but guessing that timeline is a fool's errand.

Doubling every 2 years would hit $1000 in ~4.32 years. 
$1000 = currentPrice * 2^(doublings)
The price I found was $223.53, so
1000 = 223.53*(2^x )  
Plug that into Wolfram Alpha if you are lazy or not confident in your math:
x = 2.16146  
Since doublings occur every 2 years in the model, 2x = Y years = ~4.32 years.
So, doubling every 2 years would outperform a move to 1000 in 5. If you switch it up a bit:
x = 223.53*2^2.5 (2.5 doublings for a 5 year term)  
x = $1264.48
What was the point of all of this?

Bitcoin had limited success in a niche market. It's hardly gained mainstream acceptance. It's still very much a speculative fascination and its continued success (or existence) remains to be seen.

Let's be realistic for a minute, though. Most people sending money overseas are funneling liquid assets to poorer family back home. You can't buy food in India at a market with BTC, nor is that likely to be true in the near-to-mid future. Thus, two exchange conversions are likely to be included (plus a tiny fee to try to ensure same-day and a slice of profit because an institution handling this for you has to make money). So, not really free. The only way it's free is if you already had BTC and the recipient plans to spend BTC.

This is a phase that's is unavoidable for a fledgling currency until it has **MUCH** broader adoption. If you could perform all of your financial transactions from speculative exchange trades to milk and eggs with BTC, then it will break the "X USD worth of BTC" mold. 
Timeframe? Hard to say, but not that soon.

So, more of an antagonistic onlooker: intrigued, but watching from a safe distance.
I'm in the same boat, just not disparaging those too eager to part ways with their assets. I've got alike 1.2 LTC from mining on my HTPC when it's idle that I'll probably convert to BTC and buy games from humblebundle or something like that when it's on another bubble cycle.

I think the time scale is a function of the faster, decentralized nature of trading. You don't have to call a broker to move bitcoins around once you have money in an exchange account. In 2000, the internet was immature and had much lower adoption than today (which actually was a large factor in the 2000 dotcom crash). 
The fact that the timescale is compressed is simply a function of faster networks and broader access.

I think you missed something. The opposite of libertarianism is statism or totalitarianism, but we are talking about opposing the opposite of RP also being abused, often moreso.

No, texting sucked because the way users interacted with it was on a shitty 0-9 keyboard. Once you got a full qwerty keyboard and/or touchscreen, shit was easy. 
BTC needs innovation in the user-experience space to get widespread acceptance. A wallet that streamlines the bullshit you have to do manually for securing your savings would help a lot of people. A portable means of accessing those funds anywhere (similar to putting your wallet in your phone, but less risky) would make it more usable at brick-and-mortar establishments. Having more reliable, accessible, trustworthy exchanges to buy BTC with fiat would help people not interested in mining get coins. It's getting *better* with people like coinbase setting up instant buy over ACH, but most people look into buying BTC and hear that you need to do an international bank wire transfer ($15-$25 fee) to a russian website to trade for the coins... it sets of lots of red flags.
Bitcoin needs to mature and work out the numerous rough edges in the user experience before it gets anything approaching mainstream acceptance.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:02:23
But it's still not a given that it will get easier and more streamlined just because the internet did. Keep that in mind.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:12:04
A number of your points are totally valid, but I have a bone to pick with 


Let's not delude ourselves here. The pool of BTC users relative to the internet market at large is not *that* big, and a vast majority of BTC users are already aware of Steam's services. Also, Steam is already very popular and doesn't really need the extra press coverage to gain any ground. 
You might see some small uptick of people who want to see BTC succeed (because they are hoarding/investing/a true believer of the philosophy) buying a couple extra games, but I don't see that being a big bump relative to the rest of their business. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:57:02
One guess is that it will conflict with a payment system they are working on linking your CC by way of your iTunes to a pay system that will work in stores. 
I will say, though, that a *lot* of bitcoin apps violate their TOS related to selling virtual goods without Apple getting their customary cut. I think that's why exchanges aren't allowed. Not sure about wallets. 
Personally, I'd never keep my wallet on my phone. Everyone seems to be ignoring physical security when discussing securing your btc. If someone steals your phone, they could take your life savings in a blink of an eye and it's impossible to retrieve. Doesn't matter if you have a cold storage or paper backup if they simply clean you out on the spot.

Maybe, but it really depends on if BTC starts being accepted as a real currency for goods/services. That would jeopardize China's currency control position, potentially weakening their export power.

Even as a software developer who uses console commands and shit enough to not be afraid of some command line stuff, that would be a huge pain in my ass. I'd use it way less than I do now.
As a dev who knows plenty of less tech savvy people (not moronic luddites, just non-programmer-but-competent normal humans), that sort of free-range terminal work where they have to remember the order of incantations to use and shit would be a non-starter. 
You're too close to the terminal to see how it can be challenging to others. You've gotten so comfortable with it, you've forgotten how hard it can be *at first*.

No, it's not. There's nothing about it that guarantees 100% failure or T0 DA M0ON!!11! as the only outcomes in the future. It could settle out at $200 or $20 or $5,000 or $3.33 or $0 or $0.0004 or $400,000. We all have guesses (some more educated than others) as to where that might trend, but you can't possibly divine what that will look like. 


Most everyone that your confirmation bias has put you in contact with say this. I don't think *most* people who have/use/know about/like/hate bitcoin necessarily agree. It's a convenient lie *gamblers* tell themselves to make their recklessness feel better. 
Putting your chips down on 14 at the roulette wheel is a binary bet of 0 or high return, but that's because the odds and return for hitting that 14 are written on the fucking board. No such luck with cryptocoins.

I wonder, will the IRS pay the mortgage? When the IRS taxes/credits you is irrelevant to determining if you have lost value on your assets. You have gained or lost value, they are just not acting on that until you convert it to their fiat of choice.Further, the presumption that btc will rebound up to and beyond their all time high is wild speculation based on hopes and guesses. It holds no more weight than me saying they will stabilize back to $30.

You're one to call people arrogant...Nothing about what that person said implies living in "constant fear", and the "assumed knowledge" of carrying a weapon is more of a risk-analysis.Let's break this down for you. Risk: mugger might be carrying lethal weapon and is willing to use it.  Probability: lowish, depending on region, but unknown.  Result of taking risk: either keeping possessions or killed.  Result of not taking risk: loss of possessions.Simply put, the person you responded to took this into consideration and decided the ROI wasn't worthwhile. S/he valued living at a much higher rate than the lost valuables, regardless of risk probability. As for the "sometimes they just come out swinging" line, that was out of scope foe the point being made. Further, it's odd to bring up if you are critical of others' level of fear and anxiety about muggers.

You are saying a person holding btc doesn't "lose" unless they sell the coins, regardless of the value of the btc.For this to be true, you can't ascribe value to held btc, else a drop in valuation means you lost value. Therefore, you traded money, which has value, for btc, which your fucking stupid logic has required you to place at 0 value until resold.I'm not saying the above makes sense.

I would believe it if you are talking about EBS volumes, or stuff dependent on it like Elastic Beanstalk, etc.
