implying without a super bloated warmongering control freak government there can only be anarchy in its place, rather than a continuum of other options. Including self organizing distributed institutions based on voluntarism and non-aggression. 
I think you can agree its a poor comparison. This region of Nigeria was never under the control of the Nigerian government. Its for purposes still wild and tribal. They don't even have the basics of paved roads or electricity in these regions, let alone the internet or cell phone towers. Any governing that in these areas would need be on the local level. But unfortunately governments brought in religions, radicalized the extremists in those religions and armed them. Now they can pull shit like this without being checked.

I disagree again, you can be offering a free service beta that entices clients to send Bitcoins to wallets in your control. This isn't revenue in those wallets its your customers using your service. Your not charging them so their is no revenue, yet you are in custody of their assets. If the money was revenue then that wouldn't be an issue at all because if that money was lost stolen embezzled no consumers are hurt by this.

I don't need a law to deter me from murder. The non-aggression principle does that adequately. What kind of person doesn't murder simply because the legal consequences aren't convenient for them? That premise makes me laugh. Besides the government who makes it illegal for plebs to murder has legalized murder by costumed police and troops(now even robots) so again its not even a moral dilemma to the government, they like murder, they pay costumed murderers handsome sums of money with cash taken at gun point from plebs. its a matter of privilege. The plebs don't have the privilege of legal murder.

There are different kinds of fraud. Some of which are just plain stealing so yes theft of property is not a victimless crime. 
counterfeiting money (printing your own) is of itself is victimless. When I then use said money to perpetuate a fraud of theft from a victim it becomes a true crime. if I printed 1 trillion $100 bills and dropped them in a volcano was there a crime committed? Who was the victim? 
As far as counterfeiting products and services, you can apply the same logic. If I counterfeit a toothbrush and brush my teeth with it happily. Who is the victim?

They are vague so I'll reserve judgement on them being restrictive. They are a poor idea based on a good intention(replace FDIC insurance with collateral to protect consumer) .

Nothing is wrong with optional. optional is preferred. Unfortunately our society is not gear around punishing non compliance with optional regulations. 
I'm not on board fully with the bond requirement either(should at least show table or scale for what to expect) . Though I get the purpose of it, they want to protect the consumers deposits since the FDIC isn't covering it. This is overboard though, I'd rather see insurance options for a higher fee. 
Its also too vague as is the intention of the piece about investing retained earnings.

you are misunderstanding. Nobody should have the privilege of murder. Privilege is wrong, look at the latin roots of the word priv (private) lege (law), private law. Why should we be constructing two sets of laws? Laws granting additional or special rights to the "elite". And then a set of laws restricting rights for the plebs.  Special laws for special people and enforcing them at the end of a gun barrel? its as absurd as the notion of king or queen. I came out of special vajayjay when I was born so I should be looked upon as a god upon men. I should have the right to do whatever I want at the expense of everyone else. Fuck that noise its ludicrous.
The difference between a principle and a law is one is enforced at the end of a gun barrel the other is voluntary. You cannot bring up warzones as a good example because all wars in history are perpetrated by governments sanctioning (privilege) murder usually for religious or other absurd rationale. 
Additionally, your presumption of societal retribution being nil without a law has no basis at all.

The difference being the system of milk production and consumption isn't based on distributed trust and most people aren't equipped to raise dairy cows in there apartments and homes. There is no barrier to entry in Bitcoin beyond an aptitude to download a free application. I could be wrong but I just don't think there will ever be a big space for patents in an inherently open distributed trust model. Think about it, if someone comes out with a great Bitcoin wizbang widget the barrier to entry on duplicating that in an open source is very low. People will be drawn to the open solution even if it has less wizbang features simply because they don't have to trust someone elses code.

That is pure speculation and conjecture. If any of that was true the justice system should do its job and prove it beyond a reasonable doubt rather than make up nebulous and subjective laws.
you conveniently ignored that you cannot prove any damage to society. At least with illegal toxic dumping(mining runoff) you can take pictures of the environment or ecosystems destroyed. Measure the effects of toxins in the water. And many other scientific objective measurements. Clearly damages can shown to the property of whomever owns the area where the dumping took place.
Any measure or attempt to measure the long term damage of money laundering can only be of the speculative subjective variety. Without proof of damages there is no complaint. If there is someone running a criminal enterprise law enforcement ought to prove that as true. That is how the legal system is supposed to work. Why stop at money laundering then we should make up something arbitrary like Failure to comply laws, whereby if you can't prove your not a criminal or refuse to you are charged with failure to comply and jailed. Sounds like a dream come true.
and this was already post below summarizes nicely:


"In conclusion, as I cited in my 2001 Congressional testimony on what became the USA PATRIOT Act, money launderers do not have a statistically significant chance of being caught so the deterrent effect of our AML approach is negligible. Only a minuscule fraction one percent of CTRs and SARs result in criminal convictions. I know of no examples where AML reports prevented any terrorist events. 
Our AMLs are a failure: the drug trade continues unabated, financial fraud is more prevalent now than ever, and terrorist groups continue to finance their operations. The greatest tragedy is what everyone knows and policymakers don’t seem to care: it is the unbanked, the poor, and the racially and ethnic minorities in rich countries (and the populations of poorer countries) that suffer these costs for such elusive benefits."
"We find that the current system is pervasive and highly intrusive but without any evidence as to tangible effect".
Meanwhile, it only serves to stifle competition because only the bigger players can afford to be compliant with the AML/CTF/etc. laws.

its not as simple as that. The banking system is deeply rooted in centralized authority, manipulation and regulation. There has never been a time where it was a true free market(no interference). Banks have always been given an unfair advantage via special low/no interest interbank loans, artificially suppressed interest rates etc etc etc. 
Since we are now seeing the results of 100+ years of continuous regulation that has lead to nothing but negative results, huge Ponzi schemes, tremendous wealth disparities, huge public and privates debts, maybe just maybe more of the same(regulation) isn't what is needed.

You can't prove any of that alleged damage to society it is 100% speculative.  I've never felt the least bit impacted by anyone's money laundering. In fact I'd argue the laundering of $1 trillion annually in illegal drug cash (which isn't possible without cognizant collusion by huge banks) is the only thing keeping our corrupt banking system liquid enough to operate. What did more damage to the value of the dollar, the unlimited spending trillions printed and spent by congress or....a money laundering by a few mid tier drug dealers. Should we talk about the mortgage fraud that cause the global economic crisis of which zero people went to jail? No lets focus on the illusion of a money laundering threat. 
This whole notion is preposterous. AML laws have never done a damn thing to statistically curb, stop, prevent any criminal activity. I'm done.

seems obvious to me if you are holding a million dollars in btc deposits, experimental or not seems obvious to me you should be applying the bare metal principles of accountability and asset protection established in the regulation. Why wouldn't you as a "legit" business not want to do this? 
for the record the intent of the reinvesting bit isn't clear to me the only thing I can make out is something to do with conflict of interest so I'd like to see it clarified or removed.

I think you are listing some true crimes in there with a victim who can demonstrate harm or loss to self or property. money laundering still doesn't meet that criteria of directly causing someone harm or loss of self or property .
you would be hard pressed to define a victim in the traditional sense above for counterfeiting, fraud, racketeering(this is a completely bogus term) and arm sales(adults voluntarily agreeing to enter into commerce exchange of inanimate objects).

someone has to temper some of this out of control kneejerky shit. Its as if everyone literally had the icecream cones taken out of their mouths at gun point the way they are crying. 
Far from a statist but I can't ignore that most of this regulation is quite sensible controls that should be in place and already are in place all over the financial services industry. Its basic common sense shit the most of it, logging, monitoring, auditing, reporting, its not that hard really presuming you cared about compliance with federal laws anyways. There are some changes and clarifications that are needed for sure and hopefully people pipe up about them in the next 45 days.
In the end there is room for regulated and unregulated to coexist. Decentralized solutions will become more mature and will be direct compeittors for those that want that. 
Its actually hilarious because the end result of this will be Bitcoin probably tripling in price in the next 12 months and everyone will be more than happy then. I'll predict that you will see more banks willing to do business with Bitcoin startups as a result as well.
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:38:57
There is absolutely room for both those that wish to comply and those that don't. Once the decentralized solutions mature there will be increased competition. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:14:49
You seem to think with this regulation all other services will cease to exist? Bitcoin is decentralized and global. This is entirely unenforceable to in NY and definitely holds no weight in other parts of the world. If customers want to do business with non-compliant entities there will be plenty of them as there are now. How many people trust their money with some teen hacker in Europe right now? There are decentralized optiosn as well. This isn't the end of a free market. Regulated and unregulated markets will continue to live side by side. 
where do you think you live bro? This ain't no democracy and the government doesn't give a fcuk what you think, they work for banks and mega corps. You will swallow this shit like you do the spying, militarization of police etc and so on.

Wall of words. I'm not going to address all your red herrings here but I will say the notion that complex societal constructs such as "traffic lights" cannot be created, managed and maintained by talented individuals through voluntarism is ludicrous. There are ample examples of international organizations that exist for the purpose of developing complex standards and protocols. The internet and computing in general is an example of things that would not be possible without the success of these groups. In the past this may have been difficult when we relied on snail mail and face to face meetings however in this unique period of time we have the technology to replace the role of central authority in most if not all traditional roles of government with a decentralized voluntary organization of "we the people" . There is a false notion that no central authority (call it anarchy if it makes you feel better) means no controls and chaos. This couldn't be further from the truth.

Now a more mature pov might include the realization that you don't have to agree on every political talking point with someone in order to conduct business, in fact it behooves you to put your politics aside in most situations.

relax dude, the state doesn't own the property they hold it until the owner or next of kin collects it. Its standard in like every state and its actually a good thing for protecting consumers property for example, if the company holding property gets bought or sold or goes under the account is no longer. The state on the other hand will ensure that doesn't happen.

slaves will need permission from their master anyways to be receptive to new ideas. Slaves actually cannot process ideas they can only have beliefs, ideas can be shared and changed, beliefs are solid as steel. They will die for their masters before entertaining a contrarian idea.. They will hold on to their beliefs until they  die that's why they are slaves.

I have no idea, if there is such a strong market for this I would imagine yes. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:14:46
I think you are confused. Regulation exists to give the control freaks in government more control. It is not in the best interest of an exchange to be operating a boiler room operation. The market would quickly sort out the unscrupulous players and trusted exchanges would emerge. Why is coinbase wildly successful in the US? Not because of regulation, its because they have established trust relationships with their client base through customer service and some sense of transparency.

This is a false front imo. If everyone was so anti-regulation (in general) the revolution would have already happened. What would it honestly take at this point? They don't care about the slaughtering of the middle class, immigration, massive domestic spy campaigns, illegal wars, militarization of police forces. But oh fuck with bitcoin and the internet dweebs get hot and bothered.
I want bitcoin to play out in a way that it can reach its full potential. This won't happen unless institutional investors and publicly traded firms have a framework to operate in. They and their clientel (read: big $$$) will also feel comfortable and then some real magic will happen. 
We all know bitcoin is a honey badger and absolutely won't give any fucks in the end so the real interesting experiment will be how long until the decentralized solutions truely obliterate the relevancy of any regulation framework.

You can call it taxes, or golden sunshine droplets, calling it something different doesn't change what it is...manipulating language to legalize theft. Plain and simple.. Theft is theft.

yes its a wild conspiracy. I would like for this to be true, nothing would be better for the longevity than a redistribution 
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:15:17
well the problem is the distributed demand, you need to focus the demand at one point in the payroll flow for their to be recognition that there is a market need that can be filled and profit made. I can say confidently there will not be any medium/large company modifying existing payroll systems to accommodate bitwage unless the majority of employees (100's &amp; 1000's) demanded it. So for now bitwage is relegated to small nimble companies. 
ADP, this is an interesting concentration point as you say, I actually have a relationship with a chief product architect there and I could find out definitively if its even on their road map but I doubt it, because again where is the concentrated demand coming from? They service thousands of companies, so what if only 1 or 2 are asking for it.
A big bank? your right forget it. They are like big companies it would be huge commitment to even dable in this. 
A small bank or credit union or service layer (simple.com) is probably the most likely. They could enroll people anywhere in the country (boost overall client base and deposits) significantly as a % of their base. This provides the most attractive business case for this imo. If you could demonstrate quantatively the interest in the service(ie sign up for a beta test) you could provided the concentrated demand required to kick off the effort. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:58:23

* BTC is young they will have cold storage vaults soon enough
* I wasn't complaining of inflation you were making claims about investing your fiat by keeping it in a bank account. Your investing in marginally less inflation at best congrats. Bitcoin is deflationary. 
* retail transactions are just as fast with btc without the risk of charge backs to the merchant. Also banks process the transaction(approve it) right away but it doesn't clear your account for days. So your example isn't accurate. 
* You do not need a third party or bank to draft a will. It helps and most people use a lawyer not a bank.

hypothetically if they put them on the market all at once where would the price go?

The fees aren't necessarily the selling point. The cash flow is. Take a retailer like walmart. They do millions per day in CC transactions. However they are waiting DAYS for settlement. 100 million dollars for 3-5 days in a basic money market account will collect significant interest. Spread out over the course of a year this is real money to be made with that cash flow improvement.

i.e. its automated selling not panic selling.

I don't get it, they had a change of heart and decided they didn't want to get fabulously wealthy?

So you don't ever hold the btc for other people they buy and you immediately send to their wallet somewhere else. Thanks for clarifying. I sincerely hope your bank stays friendly. Cheers and good luck.

proof of anything being stolen is not sufficient to warrant this type of paranoia. 
If this was part of a scam he was pulling it was the worst thought plan with the poorest execution in the history of scam plans.

you have to understand the only goal of the USG is to completely control every aspect of your life especially your financial life. They will never rest until they have this. While your fearing for the future of Bitcoin, they are plotting how to control the blockchain for all cryptocurrencies from now until forever.

i agree. this shit aint going nowhere if suppliers of goods (medium and large size) firms can't easily get in and out of fiat wihtout their banks getting frozen. If the producers aren't using bitcoin then the retailers have no reason to hold bitcoin and on down the chain it goes.
