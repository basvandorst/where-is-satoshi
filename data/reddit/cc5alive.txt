First you would need to create an account at  and read about the concept at 
You'll need to read a little bit about it, but essentially Ripple functions in a way that lets you loan any form of currency to anyone else based on trust.  It is exactly the thing that lets you bootstrap a credit market.  As an individual you can loan your friends BTC if you trust they will pay you back, or institutions will be able to do the same thing using traditional credit models to approve users.
Alternatively, [Stellar]( is a fork of Ripple that is trying to have a more "fair" distribution, but conceptually it should have all the same tools.
This is a bit complicated at first, but PM me with questions and I can try to point you in the right direction! :)

Alternative idea: research a coin before you buy it and see if there is anything that actually gives it value. Is there any real innovation? Who are the developers? What is the distribution plan? Those 3 questions should be enough to avoid most scam coins.
@_date: 2015-01-16 18:57:06
Fair point, but if you go to a strip mall or other location with a lot of shops, could be an interesting afternoon with the possibility of payment... Just sayin
@_date: 2015-01-01 03:58:22
I'm not sure it is the exchange's responsibility to research the coins. They provide an exchange service not an endorsement. My personal belief is that the responsibility should fall on the investor.  It's still the wild west of crypto. If the exchanges are getting a cut beyond the exchange fees that is a different story... But I don't know how we could find out something like that.
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:01:59
I'm unfamiliar with Zidisha, but I thought Kiva's interest rates were 0%. Will look into Zidisha.
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:39:08
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:37:10
I'm saying people should research the coin and the development team.  If you're trading in any market, you should research that as well.
I know I was a sucker for Worldcoin and Scharmbeck about a year ago and lost a substantial amount... but I bought into the hype rather than doing my homework, so it was my own fault.
I also invested a fair amount in Neo &amp; Bee (which was a company not a coin) and got scammed out of that, so I've had my fair share of losing my hat!
Lesson learned.
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:31:44
Exactly. Don't buy RANDOM altcoins.  There are a few that have value to them for specific reasons, but just because a new coin is created doesn't mean it's worth anything... particularly if it's just another clone of an existing coin.
@_date: 2014-12-01 22:21:07
First adaption, then adoption!
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:30:29
That's a fair point. I agree that it unfortunately may be seen by some as an endorsement... perhaps the simplest solution would be for exchanges to have a clear message somewhere on the page that explicitly states if they are not endorsing the coin.

IT IS A BAD IDEA TO START MINING NOW.
The difficulty is increasing as more and more mines are built and it's becoming easier and easier for amateurs to mine as well.  May I point you in the general direction of browser-based mining?  The difficulty is going to go up exponentially and you will not be a happy camper.
But if you could go back in time to 6 months ago, I'd say definitely.

Everyone should be **cautiously optimistic**.

I agree with you that money doesn't care where it came from and I agree with you that someone who needs to borrow against a 401(k) may not be in the right financial place to make BTC investments.
But my main point is that a retirement fund has a specific purpose and should be diversified and stable.  It is mainly comprised of broad ETFs and/or mutual funds... you don't take money from that to speculate.
Additionally, early withdrawals from retirement funds have tax penalties, so someone may end up paying more money to make a BTC investment than they would by finding another way to fund it.
MAIN POINTS:
* Money doesn't care where it comes from, but the government does.
* BTC is speculative and speculation is not a good risk profile for retirement funds.
* If you can tolerate the risk, BTC is an exciting opportunity. If you cannot, you should watch from the sidelines (i.e. r/Bitcoin).

As optimistic as we all are about Bitcoin, it would be a risky decision to pull money from a 401(k) to invest in BTC. 
BTC is highly volatile and while longterm prospects look promising, we are really all speculating. I genuinely believe BTC will grow by a huge factor over the next few years... But legislative challenges or a 51% attack or something else unforeseen could be a catalyst for a pullback. 
Think about what role the 401(k) serves: stable, diversified growth for retirement. If you have any other way to purchase BTC, consider that first and make sure you have the risk tolerance for the wild Bitcoin ride.
