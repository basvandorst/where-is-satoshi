One way that you could manipulate the market is to buy a lot of bitcoin. You could do this with brokered deals off the crypto exchanges to avoid spiking the price on large volume buy orders. Once a large enough position is held you take a short position on the ETF.  Then dump all the bitcoin as quickly as possible to crater the price and then close the short position on the ETF for huge gains. Trouble is that evidence to tell if the bitcoin trades and ETF trades are done by the same person could be impossible so the SEC has limited ability to identify and charge people of fraud
Certainly this same technique could be done for gold, wheat, pork bellies, or any other commodity. However those markets are not as easily influenced by individual players and taking physical possession of the commodity so it can later be dumped is a logistical nightmare.

Which  economic disaster is caused by government management of CAD money supply?  Or NZD or AUD?  Perhaps they are doomed to fail in the future. But as of yet government controlled fiat are still the currencies that enable trillions of of daily commerce

Not sure this follows from evidence. Governments have been controlling the money supply for a very long time now. Most have a low predictable inflation. Which sucks. But they are still going and haven’t ended with economic disaster.
