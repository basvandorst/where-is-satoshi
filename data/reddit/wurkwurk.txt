Conveniently leaving out how much of a pain in the ass it is to convert fiat to BTC and then back again for spending in the current economy. It'll cost you far more than the 10% western union charges you, at least in Canada.

Because there is overhead in every banking transaction and operation. Having a transaction bounce costs the bank money. By charging it to the customer (with a markup, to be sure), it provides and incentive to the customer to not make the same mistake in the future. More importantly, it's also an explicitly stated charge in the servicing agreement you sign with you bank.
I do think that the amount OP's bank charges for having insufficient funds is high though.

I'm afraid you're the proverbial asshole. 
I haven't paid a bank fee beyond my monthly in my life. Get over your sense of entitlement.

Sounds like you got hit with a fee for having insufficient funds. It's a legitimate charge. There are flaws to the banking system but this isn't one of them. Keep better track of your books.

That clause is in there so that a large institution doesn't have to renegotiate every little change to the contract with every Bill and Sally that keep their piggy banks with them. I haven't had a bank try to pull a 'fast one' on me.

My point is you can use banking services responsibly and not be charged for anything more than monthly fees (if that, as you've pointed out). ATM fees, overdraft fees, insufficient fund fees, etc. don't concern me. The crux of it is, I don't care if the fees are high because I find it hard to feel for a chump who can't plan ahead.
The only bone I have to pick with banks is the ~$1.50 charge for a wire transfer. And that doesn't seem to be something bitcoin really addresses, as you still have to tip the miners for (timely) coin transfers.

Well aren't you a fancy shmancy American. The only way to buy Bitcoins 'quickly' in the my dear Canadia is to meet a guy named "Ben" from Craigslist in a coffee shop and pay him in cash, with a hefty transaction fee.

I don't feel violated from a $4/month personal account charge (waived with a balance over $2k), or a $13/month business account charge. 


A bank is responsible in that they protect and insure your money. Most are very reasonable to deal with. Fees are disproportionate, but if you're responsible you never see them.

You don't know a god damn thing about banking in Canada, son. 
The entitled comment was in reference to insufficient fund charges, ATM fees, etc. If you think the bank should coddle you while you're ignorant of the agreement you have with them then you're entitled.

I am sure the government will learn of your purchase at some point during the registry and insurance process.

There is overhead in every banking operation. There is cost to system time, teller time, IT time, etc. 
And besides that, insufficient fund fees are a explicitly stated charge. The bank doesn't spring it on you out of the blue.

Nice argument you just had with yourself.

I am from Canada. I've never seen an ATM fee above $2. And that's for using an ATM that isn't from your bank. An ATM from your bank is always free. I don't know about you, but I don't expect a bank I don't have business with to give me free services.

We have one in Vancouver, so it's only realistically accessible to locals. It also charges a high rate, just like our friend Ben, though it is less likely to stab you and take your stack (kidding, Ben is great). 
A Coinbase like service up here would be fantastic.

To some people on this sub 'volatile' means 'explosive growth'.
