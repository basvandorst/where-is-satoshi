Exactly. If you use Coinbase Pro, go on the trade page and select deposit. Then choose USD and the middle option should be “Wire transfer” which will have all of the information that you’ll need. Then go to the site for your bank and (if you have an online account) you should be able to initiate a wire transfer. Enter the info from the Coinbase Pro page and (after an additional ~$35 for fees—$10 on Coinbase and an average $25 for bank) your wire should complete within a day and you’ll see the funds on your Coinbase Pro account. You can then set limit buys, stop sells, etc. or transfer the funds to your hardware wallet—should you have one.

I bought in for the first time at 13.4 lol just part of the journey!

You can always use a wire transfer from your bank. Helps a lot with larger transactions instead of having to comply with their weekly deposit limits ($100 for me).

I’ve noticed it too. I transferred all of my coin to Coinbase Pro, where the trading fees are smaller and they don’t charge more than displayed at time of purchase.

I wish I was more cognizant of Bitcoin &amp; cryptocurrency at the beginning of this year or earlier. I’ve only recently become more seriously educated about it, and I’m fascinated and truly believe it’s here to stay. Unfortunately feels like I’ve “missed to boat” so-to-speak on investing at a low market value (comparatively speaking). Then again, could bull run up to $20k or more by the end of the year, who knows.

I apologize if this has been answered before, but when you convert your crypto to fiat and withdraw it, do you have to pay taxes on only the gains you made on your initial investment, or the total sum of money withdrawn? I.e I invested $1000 and when I withdrew it I had $3000. Would I pay 15-20% taxes on $3000 or only the $2000 gain?

Do you know if a transaction to a payment channel through a different channel is automated, or would the recipient of the first payment channel have to forward the transaction? From the video’s example, using a payment channel with a friend to pay for groceries at a supermarket that I wouldn’t personally have a payment channel with. Would the friend have to manually pay the grocer, or would it all be automated?

That makes sense, and I was hoping this was the answer. Thanks for clarifying for me!
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:16:44
Yes that sounds correct. Congrats!

Thank you for the comprehensive answer, this definitely helps give me perspective on my options. I have a decent grasp on BTC conceptually, but am new to investing, so I appreciate the feedback.

Thanks for the response. That’s sort of what I anticipated, and largely agree. I was wondering if anyone has run into issues with filing for a loss on their taxes, and if it would make things smoother going from one break even point (ideally waiting to sell at 10k to recoup all money invested, or selling 100% at a single loss point), compared to many. I imagine either option is something a CPA could figure out, but was curious if anyone had a similar experience.
