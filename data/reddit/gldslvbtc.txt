Thanks! Peter Schiff once told me that bitcoins were the easiest way to transact on his website. I am sure goldsilver.com will find the same.

"And for that reason, the world of today, as we know it, is not the same as the world of tomorrow: A world in which art is disseminated peer-to-peer in exchange for micropayments of autonomously managed mathematical data, we chat and text with our loved ones (wherever they are in the world) for free and on video, and in our homes, which are dwellings we designed ourselves and printed up, a 3D-printer prints medicines from cheap, readily available and peer-reviewed chemicals, delivered from the darknet, in the kitchen.  While I am not sure of the outlook for death in an open-source civilization, objectives historically funded by "taxes" might be crowdsourced. So what's it gonna be? Donating to the most recent bombing campaign "tax" or paying the people who are going to fix your neighborhood road "tax". Neither? That's fine, too. It's your call."

It is important to know who is creating the info for us. This sort of stuff is important, and now maybe somebody who is not in the BTC ATM space can add to the article.

You're much more concise than I! Thanks for clearing that up.

In the article Hugo says bitcoin is total BS and Berwick argues Banco de Mexico is looking into a digital currency like MintChip.

PayPal has come a long way since Peter Thiel founded it, as we all know...
Peter Thiel:
• Ron Paul 2008 Presidential Campaign Committee
• Committee to Re-Elect Ron Paul
• Endorse Liberty
• Rand Paul for US Senate 2010
and also chairman of Bilderberg steering committee.

@_date: 2013-07-25 04:29:30
it is a very important thing that PayPal and eBay will be irrelevant sooner than they think.

can we place bets in bitcoin on Kurzweil's date +/-10 years? I see your point 100%.

many vendors began using BitStamp's price over Mt Gox's when the big divergence happened earlier this month or late last, one of the two.
