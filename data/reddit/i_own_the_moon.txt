Gamble is a word that people define differently based on their worldview. For some people gambling can only happen in casinos or horse tracks. Some religious people consider buying insurance to be gambling.
The point I'm trying to make is calling Bitcoin a gamble is meaningless because everyone will interpret that claim relative to where they draw the line personally.

These questions are fascinating to me, especially the enormous volume of them. Are people simply trying to get an informal poll of sentiment with the hope of sticking with the herd? Or are they really so ignorant about how markets (and reality) work that they believe someone knows the future and might be willing to share their secret knowledge?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:34:21
Reading comprehension is hard, isn't it? Here's some quick tips:
The word "likely" is a qualifier that makes a statement an opinion rather than a fact.
The word "every" was never used in OP's initial comment. This means there was no implication that his opinion about this dip applies to any other dip.


No, you clearly don't.

Segwit speeds up transactions and makes them cheaper. It is not a final solution for scaling but it does lay the groundwork for those solutions to be built on. Exchanges should support segwit because so many tx go through exchanges.

This is bound to happen while the scaling solutions are still in progress. Impatient people feel like things are not happening quick enough with BTC and decide that must mean it's going to fail. It's stupid, but it gives the rest of us a chance to buy on sale so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Hmm, good point. I didn't notice he was specifying only exchanges in existence from 2012.
Still seems like the message he wants to get across is "only Coinbase can be trusted" and I don't agree with that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:01:36
There was always a catalyst, though, like the Mt Gox theft. If nothing bad happens I do not expect the bubble to pop just because "that's what it always does".
That being said, a sizable correction would not surprise me at all. I'm hoping it happens TBH.

I have been trying to pivot away from "taking sides" against people who disagree about the potential of bitcoin/blockchain. Meeting them halfway (even when I actually think they are 100% wrong) sometimes gets people to consider points they would otherwise ignore.
Some people have an irrational hatred of bitcoin though, and nothing is going to sway them. The future is going to be rough for those folks.

Good info, and government intervention seems to me like the most likely reason that bitcoin might fail. What are your thoughts on the recent shift away from bitcoin as currency to "digital gold"?
