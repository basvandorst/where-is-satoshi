right...I saw on Kraken yesterday a bid order for over more then 200 Bitcoins at the price of 216 euros. never seen such a big order on that exchange before placed in one go. I think it was something like 57 000 euros in bid.

Generally I don't care what this fat frog is spitting out on to us. He borrowed more then $10 million crediting so called his own company's and himself - that's our CASH! The funny thing now is when appointed trustee asks him to return the money back to the customers of mt.gox he refuses to do so. Really fat frog? And what about transaction malleability lie? So funny he thinks after we get little what is left out of there everything will be over for him.

@_date: 2015-06-08 21:21:51
i get it. in fact i get the bigger picture here. if they can do this with bitcoin, then imagine about all other possibilities that comes along, - loans, deeds, real estate, commodities, you name it.. and when everyone and everything will be moved with Bitcoin underneath, people finally realize the true value of it, hence the adoption, store of value, your killer apps.

Here's how I usually explain what Bitcoin is and why it matters:
The reason it's so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don't really understand money. Money isn't wealth. It's an accounting system used to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that bitcoins are "just 0's and 1's" But that's what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person's wants or needs).
To put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We've had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the "ledger" of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the "accounting entries" in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient from a transactional perspective.
Enter Bitcoin.
It is the first currency in the world that is BOTH decentralized AND digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold, more transactionally efficient than "modern" digital banking, and enables greater financial privacy than cash. It could certainly still fail for one reason or another, but if it doesn't, it has the potential to be very, VERY disruptive.

Who's to blame for this drop? 
@_date: 2014-04-19 09:45:59
Yes, pls set up an old website so we could at least confirm our balances. And I think you have lots to do with the old website and especially their customers. The exchange named after the "famous" old btc-24 and you still have an access to its all info. Therefore you are in control of old situation and you should work with us together until the matter is completely solved.    
@_date: 2014-06-28 12:02:43
Listen Mark, why don't you tell us what happened with cash deposited to Mt.Gox?

Honestly. If I was an early adopter and have some thousands of coins - why would I be buying it more? Just keep what you have and spend them at your will whenever you feel like. Gullible masses are here to support that $400 level for them. Anyways as long as price is above $100 early adopters always will be winners. Just my observation.  
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:43:14

@_date: 2014-02-28 16:40:45
call me greedy if you want, but I have to make a point here. once I saw the price was high enough I took my BTC out of blockchain and sold them on mt.gox exchange for the sake of simple selling. guess if I ever saw my withdraw? i didn't read everyday about their problems - so how could I know? now I see my money is gone so what options left for all of us - don't  simply come out and lie to me that you lost 850K coins without any hard evidence of it. right now I have no money and no BTC - guess if I'm going to buy them back after all this confidence was purely destroyed out of my vein.  
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:22:54
Im not worried. What else can go wrong? Trustee loosing the remaining coins? Well..we kind of used to it already. So keep pushing those coins bastards.

Don't forget 200K GOX coins and around 173K silk road coins coming our way.
Andreas gave a bottom at $400 when he valued BTC from $400-$800 two months ago on youtube. Now I say that he is not a tader so we could be fairly valued somewhere between $250-$350 for the next couple of months. Just hold on Spartans and we'll be there.

The idea of a deflationary spiral is a controversial theory with no solid real world examples. The closest case study would be the great depression. There are just so many other factors there, you can't simply slap a "caused by deflation" sticker on it.
To elaborate a bit further, deflation is the enemy to inflationary-minded economists. You can't have your money actually appreciate in value, because then, the horror!
And while the same old trope gets pulled out, again and again by these guys, they don't have any real-world cases where this supposed spiral actually happened.
The USA had a few deflationary moments itself, and didn't implode. I'm sure it was completely accidental, bankers don't like it when value flows the "other way" down to common people. (Or more likely the impact of some active conflicts, political turmoil, etc..)
Anyway, Bitcoin may be a "grand experiment", but I'll take a deflationary currency over an inflationary one any day of the week.

@_date: 2014-10-14 14:31:28
Here's how I usually explain what Bitcoin is and why it matters:
The reason it's so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don't really understand money. Money isn't wealth. It's an accounting system used to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that bitcoins are "just 0's and 1's" But that's what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person's wants or needs).
To put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We've had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the "ledger" of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the "accounting entries" in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient from a transactional perspective.
Enter Bitcoin.
It is the first currency in the world that is BOTH decentralized AND digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold, more transactionally efficient than "modern" digital banking, and enables greater financial privacy than cash. It could certainly still fail for one reason or another, but if it doesn't, it has the potential to be very, VERY disruptive.

All the answers completely miss the reason. **The reason is why bitcoin exists.** The things that you can do with bitcoin are so contrary to the way transferring fiat worked. In order to buy a bitcoin online you need to get around all of fiat's limitations in cyberspace.

Now you can buy the promise of one bitcoin from a trusted third party in a regulated environment.
It is welcome to the party for the financial world's most conservative operations (i.e. most of them).
This availability, in addition to news like this, leave a lot of people exited for bitcoin's "safe haven potential" as an investment.
The general idea is that once this gets rolling there's going to be a spike in price, and an increased respect from legacy financial institutions.

Dude you are probably very young and naive. No disrespect here I'm just trying to understand this thing. So please stop downvoting my comments as they might be useful to someone like me. Now I have one more question. Why don't we make this lottery but instead of donating afterwards we'll send that money upfront! This makes more sense and the money could be kept in escrow and more importantly we'll have only those peolpe who paid for the lottery.    
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:48:00
to be honest I read the thing and I didn't get it :d I mean should I pay to participate? who's in charge of the money? if people donating to this, how we gonna get $1 mil since you aloud to donate 2cents?

At this point, it is pretty clear from this long consolidation that whatever the next move may be, it will be major trend setting move for the coming months. During times like this I tend to do thought experiments to see how this pre-breakout period would look in hindsight a few weeks from now. I just find it hard to believe a scenario where this doesn't break upwards after spending this much time up here only to fizzle out a few months before the halving.
I am anticipating a break upwards to test the next resistance levels. Furthermore, i think this has the potential to accelerate into a full blown mania if certain things conveniently fall into place at the right time. The current market tone is not overly bullish like it was in 2014 and in some instances it gets bearish from time to time, which is actually good news™ ...
Cheers to the next few months! it will be one hell of a ride one way or another

The reason it's so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don't really understand money. Money isn't wealth. It's an accounting system used to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that bitcoins are "just 0's and 1's" But that's what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person's wants or needs).
To put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We've had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the "ledger" of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the "accounting entries" in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient from a transactional perspective.
Enter Bitcoin.
It is the first currency in the world that is BOTH decentralized AND digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold, more transactionally efficient than "modern" digital banking, and enables greater financial privacy than cash. It could certainly still fail for one reason or another, but if it doesn't, it has the potential to be very, VERY disruptive.

Running XT at this time is equivalent with running Core. It's the same network, and the same Bitcoins. At some point in the future, if 75% mining majority is reached (but not before January 2016), the network will split whenever a miner creates a block larger than 1MB. This will not be accepted by Core unless they adopt a large blocks patch, but will be accepted by XT, and at this point there will effectively be two chains. Running XT means that you will always be on the largest (75%+) chain, regardless of whether the fork actually happens or not. Running Core means that you will be left behind if a 75% majority is reached. Regardless of which version you run, coins will be safe (on both chains) as long as you acquired them prior to the fork, and for some time the chains will largely mirror each other, but eventually they will diverge due to different coinbases (mining rewards).

Gold has perceived value because it is scarce, quasi-indestructible, and serves an industrial purpose. Bitcoin inherits all of these attributes and also adds the characteristics of portability and perfect divisibility. Both are also exceedingly durable and cannot be counterfeit. The main advantage for bitcoin over gold as a commodity is that bitcoin has perfect portability, while gold must be insured, physical stored and guarded, and verified that the integrity of the substance has remained intact and not mixed with other filler metals such as tungsten. If you are moving precious metals across borders, you must declare it. No amount of border authorities or cash sniffing dogs can detect if you hold bitcoin, as ownership can be distilled to memorizing a private key which controls the associated wallet. If you are attempting to buy something with gold, it usually needs to be exchanged for currency first. Bitcoin payments need only a smartphone to transact.

i got in 2013 march. my friend from Baltic's went to London and he was squatting over there. one day he accidentally met Amir Taaki and all his team in one of these squat houses. they were all very exited about bitcoin and my friend got interested too. then he skyped me next day and told half lips about it. i read about bitcoin immediately and got hooked straight away. (in the past my friend gave me good tips that worked magically somehow so i trusted him and his intuition). so i started buying when the price was $36 and since then lost many of them on different exchanges that went bust but nevertheless still made nice profits. yes i do hold some bitcoins too from early days. these are never meant to be sold.

I've contacted them like a day or two ago about my money not being withdrawn and the guy gave me this very reasonable answer:
because of technical problems we must delay payouts at this moment.
We try to fix the problem as soon as possible.
Payments will processed with a delay from another bank account.

@_date: 2013-04-16 15:59:12
Here is what one guy was posting on IRC and I think it should be answered by Simon or whoever he is ASAP:
1) I still have USD in my btc24 account, where are they and what should I expect or do? 
2) I still have EUR in my btc24 account, where are they and what should I expect or do? 
3) I still have BTC in my btc24 account, where are they and what should I expect or do? 
4) I have deposited funds through SEPA to the Polish account, what is the status and what can I expect? 
5) I have deposited funds through SEPA to the German account, what is the status and what can I expect? 
6) When will BTC24 be open for trading again? 
7) Will my user / password be reset? 
8) What has happened the past few days? 
9) What will happen to multiplied transactions, are they rolled back? 
10) How am I (TAIS) doing?
My personal concern here is question number 2. I have withdrawn money on 3/Apr and they where never transferred to my bank account in Dublin. If someone could tell me what bank is holding them as I'm confused between all these German and Polish accounts I could give a call to Poland (my girlfriend speaks polish) and find out from the bank itself what is happening. My personal damage here is nearly 10 000 euros.

I believe their polish account is frozen it is just they are not saying that to people yet. how do I know? it's the same polish bank who got in trouble all bitcoin-24.com folks and I'am one of them...
so I have dilemma here...two exchanges turned me down so far..
