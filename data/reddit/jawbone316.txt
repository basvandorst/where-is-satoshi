Remains to be seen.

As long as you use USD instead of bitcoins, everything works really well.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:45:27
No transactions are substituted here.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:19:38
And adding the token transforms it into a fairly efficient pyramid scheme. Modern technology is amazing.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:05:35
Is this some kind of parody?
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:56:00
So if somebody else pays a fee for you, you don't have to pay it yourself? Wow!
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:44:46
They won't get their money, banking regulators will set daily withdrawal limits. Now, a far more important question: what if the Moon is made of cheese?
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:29:45
Segwit is not required, a malleability fix of any kind is enough.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:19:55
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:38:54
Who's we, you're talking to yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:55:43
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:55:52
No. The company still pays the salary in USD in the normal way, only to a different bank account.

LN literally works by locking up users' bitcoins for the lifetime of the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:55:32
Every nontrivial function of bitcoin turns out to trust-based in the end.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:35:18
The point is that the problem with bitcoin is bitcoin, the less you use it the better.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:21:08
You don't have to withdraw any cash to buy stuff with your money.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:21:27
Lol, a classic Paulbomb :D
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:23:01


You and Ron Paul got just brutally owned. Deal with it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:52:02


Like 80% of the people here believe that LN will have almost zero fees.  Almost zero fees that'll somehow still be a strong incentive to run a node.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:47:54
An elite club of people just aching to throw their money at middlemen, the more the better.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:37:57
So you'll wait and cheat only when the channel is almost spent. Tiny downside, huge upside.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:57:29
Nonsense, all the intermediaries know.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:22:13
The original buttcoin
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:16:46
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:17:45
I guess most people don't share your optimism towards LN? Experts sure don't.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:10:01
No, it will apply to the butt exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:13:33
But they'll be right at home with HYIPs and MLM schemes!
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:42:11
Not really, otherwise you're just trading traditional IOUs instead of bitcoin IOUs.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:45:46


Nope, they'll be much higher. Locking up money costs money.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:39:46
So it's like buying yourself except the middleman also takes a slice?
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:28:41
No, a comma is the list separator.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:52:19
Segwit is not required to fix malleability, and a hard fork is a much cleaner solution.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:54:13
That's what the plus is for.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:46:12


Yes and yes.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:12:43


That's right, bitcoin has its very own horror stories
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:14:53


Saving in the way you understand it is not good for the economy. Investment is. Deflation discourages investment, inflation encourages it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:48:57
Apparently there isn't, otherwise OP surely would be using it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:05:55
Thanks, Obama!
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:54:48
Oh wow are you in for a surprise.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:22:11
For ten times the fee, I assume.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:35:32
And yet he's better than you
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:06:08


No, no there isn't. It's a negative-sum game. The average outcome is a loss.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:42:29
Don't install anything because someone on reddit asks you to. TeamViewer has been used to steal bitcoins before.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:12:25
I guess it does not work as advertised then?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:57:26


A nonsense statement since if the tech is developed everyone will use it, not just bitcoin. There is no long term competitive advantage in cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:42:16
Wrong, you lose when you buy and gain when you sell.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:12:20
Well, ok then. Everything is regulated in one way or another. The tax authorities will know. In most places you pay income tax for mined or earned coins directly, and capital gains tax on the possible appreciation of any coins you own when you sell them for actualmoney or another crypto.
