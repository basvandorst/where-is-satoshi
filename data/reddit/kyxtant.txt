Found it. 
Had to clear and reset notifications in chrome.

Perhaps I'll just toss the paper wallets in the firebox for next year's presents. Maybe by then Bitcoin will be up and Lightning implemented and it will be an excellent gift...

Seriously. I spent $16 in fees to set up two paper wallets of $25 a piece for my nephews. Now that's $18 per wallet.
At this rate, I'm gonna have to just sweep those wallets and get them a couple of gift cards...

I'm giving both of my nephews .0015 BTC. They're in their early 20's. Typical gift is a $20-25 gift card. 
Paper wallets. I printed three copies. I'll give them their wallets in a card. I'll pass a copy to my brother for him to file away and I'll keep a copy that I'll file away. 
Seems simple enough.

Well, I'm hoping they hodl...otherewise, I'll let them know the lowest fee places to cash out...

*Q-12: Is a payment made using virtual currency subject to information reporting?*
*A-12: A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the 
same extent as any other payment made in property. For example, a person who in the 
course of a trade or business makes a payment of fixed and determinable income using 
virtual currency with a value of $600 or more to a U.S. non-exempt recipient in a taxable 
year is required to report the payment to the IRS and to the payee. Examples of 
payments of fixed and determinable income include rent, salaries, wages, premiums, 
annuities, and compensation.*
That comes straight from the [IRS website]( Seems to me that as long as your purchasing something for less than $600 USD, then you are good and do not have to report. I am not an accountant, or attorney, or anything else along those lines, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.
I was researching the very same thing, today. I am beginning to get uncomfortable with the amount of bitcoin being stored on my phone. I've been eyeing TREZOR, lately, and would like to make the purchase in BTC. 111 EUR is less than that $600 USD, so it should be fine.

 I'm no economist, by any means. Not even remotely.
Maybe it's the 'Murica in me, but I see Bitcoin and cryptos in general benefiting the citizens of others.
The USD will not collapse. Not in my lifetime. Not in my great grand children's lifetime. First world nations will be ok. Second world nations, as well. 
Cryptos can save those in nations that are completely unstable in all aspects of life. Moreso politically, than anything else. Nations so unstable that their currency is worthless. Nations without the resources capable of stabilizing that currency. Nations where those fortunate enough to have funds in stable, foreign currencies, fear the government may seize their foreign currencies or assets.
Loaf of bread shoots up to 100 local fiat? It may be illegal to pay $2 USD. But it would be easier to exchange .0001 BTC into your shit local fiat, then go to the market.
That's who crypto is made for.
Not for me, where 30 years ago my mom would by loaf of day old bread for 25 cents and I'm now paying $1.00 for fresh bread.

Paid for my Trezor with BTC when it was around 16k. Started buying in around $6500. The way I see it, I picked up a Trezor at a huge discount...

Hardware wallet for storing you're crypto currencies offline...

I get the need for a hardware wallet, I do.
However, I just recently got into BTC before it hit $6k for the first time. Bought USD $100-worth.
A Trezor wallet is running $105 on Amazon, at the moment.
At some point, I do intend on getting a hardware wallet, but not for a while.
At what point do you think it will be needed? At what point is it considered reckless to not own one?
