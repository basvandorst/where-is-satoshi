Why not include Mike's statement about coinwallet?

Why is moving transactions off the blockchain a good thing?

That's the thing though. If users want faster transactions, they will use the spoke that can provide that for them.
If one spoke controls say 60%+ (just a large number for argument's sake) transactions, What's the point of the blockchain then?
I don't see any controls in place to prevent payment processors from alienating the blockchain and controlling/processing transactions between themselves and ignoring the blockchain altogether.

so instead of 75% of an extremely large number we are forced to work with 20% of 5.
Bitcoin's future is doomed. It's already centralized.

The first is responded to on the mailinglist 
and the second is a comment from the code that only activates when the node can not function due to a DDOS. Additionally calling it a blacklist is hilarious reprioritization of connections is one of the most sane ways to mitigate a DDOS.

That's the cool thing about open source, it doesn't matter what you believe when you are wrong.

Why would be people be ok with slower transaction times? Take for example a merchant who needs fast transactions, why would they move off the fastest node?
There aren't any controls in LN to prevent this and i doubt there ever will be. Moving transactions off the blockchain is dangerous and should be avoided.
