It really is. I'm an accounting major and this is just one of those classes I need to fill a requirement for my senior year, but it turns out the subject is so damn interesting. I've spent hours and hours on investopedia, reddit threads, and other sources trying to learn more about portfolio management. I wish I could have taken the class earlier. Regardless, this whole chain of events is fascinating.

I would honestly love to get more insight on the topic. Wouldn't it be a safer bet to pull out some of the funds now, rather than wait it out? Especially in regards to the Congress talks tomorrow? I understand that intrinsic value is important, but such a huge gain would leave me wary.

haha. Nothing wrong with buying into what you invest in. I'm interested to see how this all plays out, especially in the morning. But as far as all you investors...TO THE MOON!!

I'm so happy for you and your son right now! Just be aware that tomorrows Congress meeting MIGHT have a negative impact on tonight's huge earnings. Greed is a dangerous thing...

Practice what you preach, brotha! For me, I took the assignment seriously. Gotta start somewhere, thanks for the insight though.
