What gives a bitcoin its value?
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:18:16
Yes. If you have not overwritten the sectors which contained the original block download you could in theory run recovery software to recover the files. However you would need to free up some space on your Mac somewhere else before doing so. The problem is going to be finding software that allows you to do that for free.

I know. It's not the original vision of Bitcoin we all signed up for. However, I suggest to those interested -learn about what is really going on and you will have your minds blown. The rabbit hole goes very deep with this one.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:29:16
You’ll understand soon. Keep digging.

Unpopular opinion: Bitcoin and blockchain tech was created by Governments possibly with the help of AI. There will be no crackdown on Bitcoin because guess what?? It's in their best interest to make us all believe it's decentralized, to let the price moon, and then to tax it. It's going to replace fiat currency, just not the way we all wanted. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:40:40
Wrong 
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:21:08
That’s incorrect. Blockchain is a type of a network, not a protocol. Bitcoin and Ethereum are HTTP 3.0. It’s good to be clear about these types of things.

Actually, it’s likely very true guys. AI uses the blockchain to get smarter. Do some research. Wake up and smell the coffee. You are all being played. That doesn’t mean don’t use bitcoin, or you have to care to know how the car works to drive it. But you should have a basic understanding.

The problem is lack of education with all you flippin' drones. Global Warming is a NATURAL occurrence from the result of the procession of the equinox. If you don't know what that is do some research. Oil production uses WAY MORE ENERGY than bitcoin mining. You can't even compare the two. There is no problem when it comes to global warming it's a political scare campaign. WAKE UP.

Bitcoin is just basically the start of this whole thing. It will always be the original and likely most valuable chain/store of value. Of course other cryptocurrencies are going to matter in the long run, just as much as bitcoin. The key is, utility. Bitcoin will offer the most store of value. Sure you’ll be able to buy things with it but if you do it better be a million dollar house or you’re crazy. Other chains like Litecoin will serve as an equally useful store of value and people will use their Litecoin for every day transactions, and save their bitcoin to pay off an entire house in one pop. Of course it’s situational and dependant on a variety of personal factors. I am speaking in general terms but this is where we are headed. Ethereum is going to play a huge role as well in the ‘application’ layer of things which factors in the human element in a major way. Look how apps already play a major role in all of our lives. Soon apps developed using the Ethereum blockchain will be everywhere. Micro-transactions to the moon. Electroneum is also one that people should not underestimate. These tokens are going to gain sooo much freaking value in the next 5 years; if you guys think they’re expensive right now -just wait. Eventually, one day in the future a bitcoin will hold even more value than what it is worth in dollars. And when that happens, -and it’s not very far away, fiat is dead. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:03:48
Chances are too low. Besides, why does it matter ?? Are you thinking you can make money mining your own transactions ??? Lolllll

Uh. Yeah it is. You can make about $4-5 USD/day with a GTX 1070 right now renting your GPU power out with Nice Hash. How is that not worth it? Sleep, make bitcoin. Go to work, make bitcoin. 
If you finely tune the fan control you’ll never have a problem. Mining on a GPU is no harder than gaming on it 24/7.

That’s just as stupid. Anyone who ‘buys’ or uses BTC to acquire BCH right now is a complete idiot. 
BCH is going to crash so hard right back to where it was or lower before all this started. Don’t let greed, fear, and ignorance ruin you. You will lose $$ if you ‘buy’ BCH.

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:29:55
What I mean is, the bad actors who are manipulating the market know that people will FOMO and use their BTC to get more BCH. Then the price of BTC plummets and these bastards who just got a ton of $$ from the BCH ‘pump’ then take their profits and buy a TON more BTC since it’s so cheap. Think about it. It’s clear market manipulation. They wanted it to appear as though coinbase launching BCH is the reason for the pump but that’s basically impossible.

Know what's funny? It's in the best interest of the tax man to let BTC moon as much as it can before they tax anyone. I have a feeling we won't see real actual regulations in the crypto space for another year or so. Makes much more sense to tax on 1 million per BTC than 50k doesn't it :) Which okay, sure. For anyone holding more than 1 BTC, you should be pretty happy even after paying taxes. Who cares.

I don't believe it can. The system won't allow that to happen or the transaction will not be verified by the network. So, the answer is still no. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:11:15
It seems most of the new emerging cryptocurrencies are trying to gain the same momentum and market space as bitcoin. This is for obvious reason. Bitcoin is the big daddy and will always be the big daddy. They do this by creating elaborate marketing schemes and even paying people off to write positive reviews on their social media etc. There is always someone behind the crypto making a massive profit. That's really the point of these emerging crypto's. Start-ups see it as a way to get rich quick when they get a ton of people investing in a popular crypto. And that's it. They don't really care what happens from there. It's up to the market to decide if it will go big or not, but really, you have to consider many factors when looking at all the different cryptos. What are they being used for? What's their utility? That's ultimate what will drive it's value and potential market share increase. Right now the internet of value is emerging but smart contracts are right on the horizon. Without a doubt many large companies are working on applications which will utilize the ethererum, ubiq, and neo blockchains. Which ones will take off really depend on the usefulness and availability of said applications. But you can bet on smart contacts being a HUGE deal in 10-20 years and since these emerging cryptos are relatively inexpensive compared to bitcoin it's kind of a no brainier to invest there.. Anyway, without this turning into a wall of text. Choose carefully. I personally do not trust all these emerging crypto's although I admit the whoppercoin looks interesing! ha

@_date: 2017-11-21 16:02:14
You can't look at it that way. All it means is we are used to seeing trends with the .Com startups and then ultimately the surviving players like Amazon, Google, Facebook etc. Cryptocurrency will not function the same way the .Com boom did so you can't apply that format to what's happening right now.

Yes. You are pretty much in the best position you could be in for the fork. Hardware wallets are the most secure way to store your private keys at current. Ledger will come out with an official statement on how to split your coins safely once the fork occurs. Just have to be patient now.

Bitcoin blockchain is being spammed with fake transactions. The mempool is full and there is a backlog of unprocessed transactions. Is this a coincidence with Bitcoin Cash price soaring over the last 24 hours? Of course it's not.. Not a good idea to send any bitcoin right now, your transaction will go through.. eventually..

What sucks about this is, no one can stop them. Sure we can rally together and try to retain the majority of the hashing power.. but it's kind of funny. It is because of bitcoins open source nature that Segwit2x is even allowed to happen in the first place. Catch 22. Again, nothing can stop them. I am not supporting Segwit2x however something in my gut tells me we might be in for a surprise. No replay protection pretty much sums up the mission statement of Segwit2x if they had one. They are here to disrupt the system and disrupt it they will. I hope you all control your private keys. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:53:08
No. Just retain your private seed from electrum, and import it into whatever wallet you want to claim your new coins from and viola. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:16:14
Bread wallet gives you the option to write down your private key when you first initialize your wallet. However Coinbase controls your private keys, although I believe they will be providing users a S2x option just be careful before you make any transactions on either chain. Do your research. Many software wallets do allow you to export your private keys.

Segwit2x is Monsanto in disguise. Everything is Monsanto in disguise. Amazon just bought whole foods right? Guess who own's Amazon? Guess who is running over 80% of the Segwit2x nodes? Yup.. Amazon. Amazon is also integrating with Electroneum, and just registered 3 domain names relating to cryptocurrency. Sometimes it helps to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Segwit2x is the attempt at the corporate take over of Bitcoin and it must not be allowed to become the main chain! I would love nothing more than for B2X to just become another shit coin because it would prove the very roots and foundations of bitcoin are more than just a currency. Bitcoin itself is a decentralized protocol and major corporations are trying to control and centralize it. Can you imagine if the HTTP protocol had a token and a blockchain when it was first developed? What do you think the HTTP token would be worth today? (speculation) but you can see where I'm going with this. We need to start thinking of bitcoin more as a protocol, AS WELL as a store of value with functions like currency (and potentially smart contracts through layers like rootstock). Sorry for the longwinded answer I could go on because it kind of makes my blood boil a little. If the miners don't sell out due to the Segwit2x chain being more profitable to mine we will be good. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:04:29
Lol. You don’t get it yet do you. You’ll see
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:05:00
I'm beginning to wonder... what if Segwit2x becomes the main chain. Say it's worth $1000/coin. And you have 1 BTC (currenty at 7K). So when you send your BTC over to S2X you now have 6 + Segwit2x BTC's valued at 1K each instead of 1BTC valued at 7K. -So now imagine Segwit2x BTC goes to 6 or 7K? Would this be a bad thing? My point is whatever happens just be prepared to take advantage of it. DO NOT send any BTC transactions around the time of the fork and up until a couple weeks after. Check with your official wallet provider for a statement on how to safely get your S2X coins.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:25:40

@_date: 2017-11-18 14:08:51
There is an 'actual reason'.
Can you imagine if when the HTTP protocol was created, it was on a blockchain? What if there was an HTPcoin, -how much would that be worth today???
I hope you can see where I am going with this.
Bitcoin is a PROTOCOL (similar in thought (not in function) to HTTP) Which can serve as a UTILITY.
Serving as a CURRENCY is simply one function of MANY. 
Layers to the Bitcoin protocol will help it scale and process transactions faster. Meaning -this protocol has many more use cases than simply serving as a store of value.
The entire development of applications and utility for every industry are currently being rewritten to work on the blockchain. In the future there will be nothing that is not on a blockchain and if it isn't it will not be trusted. Simple as that. There is so much potential value in cryptocurrency it's not even funny. You will see crypto from every major industry, countries, corporations, etc. There are going to be as many different kinds of crypto as there are people. However only ONE of them will be the only you don't want to spend and just HODL -Bitcoin. In the future tokens will be a form of self expression and may only serve limited functions, but think of it like an artist writing a song.. ANYWAY. I hope that gives you an idea as to what we are ACTUALLY seeing happening here.
We are at the early days of the internet before there was any WWW and actual websites. THAT's how early we are to the game, -but you don't have long. 6 months or less to get your hands on ONE whole bitcoin. (Which is ALL that you will need to have a very comfortable future). Shit is about to hit the fan.

This is pointless. Bitcoin has inherent value in itself that you cannot get even from backing it with something like gold. When bitcoin overtakes the gold market cap then what?? Just be patient and give the price time to stabilize and then Bitcoin will be regular money, and it doesn’t need to be backed by anything other that it’s own network.

Tell him bitcoin is like the internet was in 1995. I remember riding my bike with my friends to another friends to get a 36kb modem. -*Let the Harold angel sing*- Right now it still has training wheels. If he's smart and act's fast (before the end of the year) he may not miss the boat he's thinking of. Tell him to watch videos by andreas antonopoulos. There's a ton of great ones on YouTube. Maybe suggest a Coinbase account and purchasing small amounts, or if he has a gaming PC with a GTX 1050ti or above he could start using Nice Hash miner to mine some alotcoins and get paid in BTC. It wouldn't be much, but the key is to act sooner than later.

Private blockchains will ultimately fail. Private blockchains are really in practice not any different than a DMZ. This way of doing business won't fly in the future. For now people are just trying to take advantage and ride the coat tails before it's too late. I personally don't think there will be many private block chains which succeed in the long run, as it defeats the purpose of the technology.
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:18:37
I agree. Not to downplay the importance of the tech. Its extremely important, but the majority of bitcoin users won't even care how the tech works let alone what a blockchain is. Unless 1 BTC is worth 50k, the rest of the world won't really care. But if 1 BTC = 2.5 million USD then the entire world can use it as currency. Then there needs to be a simple way for the average joe to just download an app, and be good to go.
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:54:32
It's simple math. In order for BTC to be adopted and used as a world currency 1 BTC must be worth around 2.5 million. This is of course if BTC replaces almost every form of currency out there.. Which is unlikely, but theoretically possible. So probably, it will land somewhere between 0 and 2.5 million haha.

Hey look at it this way. If the ban in china is for real then you would think that their overal mining power will go down. Being that China has most of the worlds mining power, in theory if ,crypto and mining becomes a no no then that leaves a greater percentage of the hashing to other miners. They've had a monopoly on mining, their mining farms are ridiculous. I understand due to the large population they can affect the market, however I don't believe all thus fud about China has been what's actually affecting the price of BTC. If you zoom out on the charts, it's just doing what it always does. This is the calm before the storm.
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:26:38
Okay, so explain how BTC is going to help in this scenairo? It's fishy you have to admit. It would make a TON more sense to seek out people who are willing to offer you things like food, water, and shelter than ask some strangers on the internet for free Bitcoin. Not to downplay the tragic circumstance of what is happening and the harsh realities people must face. They are very real and very tragic. However if you're using that as a way to get sympathy to get BTC that is selfish and greedy. Sorry to say mate, but no ones going to donate anything to you.

I'm not sure if you are familiar with the OSI layers, but I believe similar layers are being developed right now around bitcoin. Bitcoin has more utility than just a store of value or currency. The bitcoin block-chain can also be used for the same function as ethereum -smart contracts. In order to do this there is a layer being developed on top of the bitcoin blockchain called Rootstock. You may have also heard of the lightning network. This is to increase transaction speeds. At any rate there will be more layers added on to the bitcoin block chain until it has many different uses aside from and including but not limited to just currency. At that point where the bitcoin block-chain is developed like the OSI layers of networking are today, the value of BTC will definitely be at the moon. It should be clear by now that there are many, many players working behind the scenes to make Bitcoin the iPhone of cryptocurrency.

(If you take all the posts like this and add the number of BTC we are talking about thousands of BTC's that people have no idea how to access) again.. YEAH RIGHT.

Yeah no offense, but your post doesn't really make sense for many reasons. There is much reason to be suspicious. As a security professional maybe I am a little bit paranoid, -and for good reason.. but posts like yours unfortunately leave more questions than answers. 
For the sake of argument let's say you had 65BTC, why would you post on an internet subreddit full of strangers for help getting them back when you lose them? Do you really trust a room full of strangers to help you? Do you know how much money you're dealing with? Why wouldn't you just immediately find and hire someone who is trustworthy and knows what they are doing to help recover your crypto? (Please don't tell me that's what you were doing here). As I mentioned, I made a post about this the other day. It doesn't make sense for someone who to have THAT much BTC and not know what they're doing and not have it on a hardware wallet. Not trying to give you a hard time, however I am not just going to blindly believe your story. You could be a hacker. You could be trying to take advantage of someone who helps you in unsuspecting ways. These are all theories, however I am simply saying that 'something does not add up about your story'. :) Anyone who blindly believe this kind of thing is asking for trouble. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:14:16

@_date: 2017-10-02 14:10:08
Sorry maybe I didn't explain very well, it was late last night when I replied. I am not an expert so someone please correct me if I am wrong but I do not believe that you will be able to get the money your friend sent you. The only thing you can do is make a new wallet for yourself and use the new address from now on. Unless you want to format your computer then you can use Electrum again. The problem at the moment is your registry. It's pointing to the fact that your seed was imported into Electron Cash preventing you from using Electrum regularly. At any rate you might just have to cut your losses and start again.
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:58:40
The price will stabilize once the adoption rate increases. We are talking a couple years here at least but the idea is in the future 1 BTC will be worth at LEAST 'X' amount, and that will not change as drastically as it is now. In order for BTC to be used as a world currency once bitcoin would have to be worth at least 1 million dollars, or more. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:45:35
Imho, by sometime before 2030 it won't matter if you have 1 bitcoin or 1000 bitcoins. Bitcoin will have an infinite store of value eventually. Think a number like Pi. It's just so large that we are going to call it infinite because we will never, ever get to the end. And one satoshi will be hella useful by then. I've been telling people, -you have about until the end of 2018 to get your hands on ONE bitcoin, because after that it will become EXTREMELY difficult to get one, if not impossible for 99% of humans. So yeah, if you can get just one bitcoin and hold onto it for 3-10 years you are going to be one of the most fortunate individuals in the new world.

Pi is a number that is essentially infinite. When bitcoin has an infinite store of value, it won’t really matter what the number is. And it won’t matter if you have 1 bitcoin, .5 bitcoin or a million bitcoin.

Let’s see if this is clear. -You don’t like or want North Koreans to mine bitcoin. Yet the reality is, they can do whatever they want. What’s the point ?? I do not condone ill intent or harmful behaviour to others however mining bitcoin itself is neutral. It’s the intent of the individual that’s the problem. Maybe I don’t like drug dealers mining bitcoin to buy and sell drugs in silk road, yet no one is stopping them mining bitcoin or complaining about it. Don’t get me wrong, I know what you’re trying to say however your argument is flawed. You can’t stop anyone from mining bitcoin, and then doing whatever they want with said bitcoin.

Rootstock allows for smart contracts on the bitcoin blockchain. It will only increase the value of the main protocol (bitcoin) if other tokens are created. It’s better to invest in the root protocol (bitcoin / ether ) than its tokens. (or any of the other erc20 coins)

I would like to add to this thread. If you care about your BTC, 1. yes get a hardware wallet, and 2. DO NOT VIEW PORNOGRAPHY on the same device you have your bitcoin wallet on. This is how hackers compromise your device. When you click play on pretty much ANY pornographic video online a rootkit is installed on your device. It doesn't matter what kind of device it is, or what kind of security you have. When you click play you are essentially accepting the end user license agreement to install third party applications on your device. If you want to be secure first of all do not store your BTC on an exchange. A wallet on your computer is better if you control your own private keys, but a hardware wallet is even better. Do not use remote monitoring software (such as teamviewer) on any device which stores your bitcoin or has your bitcoin wallet. Do not download any pirated or illegal software or even visit websites which are not 'secure.' Make sure you use an extremely strong password, and don't use the same password across all sites and devices for the love of god. Remove your phone number from any accounts associated with bitcoin (unless you're using it for 2fa) however using a burn phone and or google authenticator is a better idea than associating your real phone number with your bitcoin accounts.
If you have viewed pornography on the same device your bitcoin wallet is on, I'd highly recommend sending the funds to a new wallet. Reformatting your computer (or phone) and then setting it up again with better security and follow the recommendations above to better secure your investment. Hardware wallets are great, not knocking them. But there's really no point in having one if you're just going to get compromised through software still anyway.

I doubt that very much. Especially considering how much Bitcoin adoption is taking place behind the scenes. Next year you’re going to see it blow up, go viral, whatever. And there will be systems in place to handle mass adoption, such as lightning network and rootstock. There are also other solutions being worked on no doubt. I have very little faith in many other alt coins, they’re called alt coins for a reason. But that’s just me. In the grand scheme of things, there’s only room for a couple of cryptos to be at the top.

A hardware wallet with a screen. Why? Trezor and Nano S can still be compromised via malware on your computer. Hackers are smart and they are all just waiting for the right moment. Why a hardware wallet with a screen? The user must be physically present to verify any transaction on the device by physically interacting with the screen. This level of security cannot be reproduced by other devices. Yes I am recommending the Ledger Blue.
Edit: Maybe I didn’t explain well enough. The hardware wallets themselves cannot be hacked, however the data transmitted between the device and the PC can be intercepted (basically the seed key can be compromised when the device doesn't have it's own dedicated screen) Source: John McAfee. Go to about 25 min in and listen to the end, or better yet listen to the entire thing.

It’s worth it

Dear OP. I am sorry to hear about what happened to you. I don't believe there is anything you can do to get your BTC back.. For anyone else reading this - it's a good idea to remove your phone numbers from any accounts associated with bitcoin. Or any online accounts that you can possibly remove it from for that matter. Google Authenticator is the way to go as 2FA (sms) can be easily hacked!!!

It won’t be weird soon.

Bitcoin cash is BCH. BCC is bitconnect.

It’s not the hardware wallets which get malware. It’s your computer. Hackers can still get your BTC

You can pay tax with crypto too why not 
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:41:48
Dude, you have no idea 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:09:30
Dear OP. You do realize that if you leave your BTC on coinbase you do NOT have control of your private keys, correct? This is not a good thing. Let me break it down for you. -Not your private keys=not your bitcoin. Your private keys=your bitcoin. I understand you may be new to the space, and it looks like you have a basic understanding of things however it is clear you are still a beginner. Please do not go around telling people to store their BTC on Coinbase. Hardware wallets are the safest way to go at the moment. User vigilance goes without saying but seriously my friend, you have no idea what you’re talking about.

So it’s the same as selling bitcoin ? Because technically you aren’t selling BTC, you’re selling access to it. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:09:45
The top? We are just getting started.

You can use your twelve word recovery phrase to input into a variety of different wallets to recover your coins. Try electrum.
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:48:46
I agree, however the chances of there being as many as we've seen are slim. Point being, people who come here and post "I have 200 BTC, what should I do with them, or how do I store them" are clearly full of shit.

BCH took value from BTC. So we didn’t really make money. If you put your BCH back into BTC you just evened out.

ASIC resistant/proof chains/tokens are the future. Centralized mining will be for internal companies offering products/tokens. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:10:41
And what does that make you? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:19:09
Let me help you. The original Bitcoin symbol is just a B. That’s it. Do you see the difference between that and the BCH symbol?? 
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:49:40
Dear OP.
I believe Bitcoin is fated to become the world currency. 
Every country will soon have it's own crypto, and be backed by Bitcoin. 
Get ready.

So funny. Good. We can’t let him get away with this bs anymore!
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:12:29
Did you even take a look for yourself before stammering around like an ego maniac? What does the symbol for bitcoin cash look like? What does the symbol for bitcoin look like ? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:46:52
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:48:24
Isn't that the symbol for Bitcoin Cash?? If you google Bitcoin, all you see is the Bcash symbol. Are people getting confused? Do you actually think the general uninformed public will mistake BCH for Bitcoin, and do you think they even care?
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:31:29
Ravencoin ftw 
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:24:02
If you check out bitcoin.com, which we all know is owned by Roger Ver -it has exactly the same symbol as the one on this shop. The B with the cash lines going through it. Do you really think Roger is shilling the original Bitcoin logo on his website? Hello. You’ve been tricked, this is exactly what I’m talking about.
