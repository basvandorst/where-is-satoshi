damn thats wild lol!! When btc was pumping around 5\-6k the first time i kept checking my phone and would freak out after i sold cause i would get FOMO as the price was rising, then around 15\-16k it happened again \(after the first spike of 19k then the spike to 19k once more\) I literally would be thinking about my gains all night and id make $300 in a matter of minutes then lose some and feel real dumb. My friends who gamble at the casino can relate with me, but i just play with crypto lol
