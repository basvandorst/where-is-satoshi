Hi there! I hope this is ELI10 enough:
What's interesting about programs running on a computer is that they actually have quite a lot of rights, especially compared to what's strictly necessary for them to work. For example, a simple text editor would only need to access a single file on disk (the one it's editing) and update a window on screen, but in practice it's allowed to do a lot of scary stuff in the background (e.g., make connections to other computers on the internet). This has two disadvantages:
* Once an attacker manages to take control of a program on your computer, he/she may likely take over the entire system, scan the network, attack other systems on the network.
* This approach also tends to make software harder to administer/maintain. For example, may be hard for a systems administrator to determine up front what the impact of running a program will be.
Over the decades we've seen lots of solutions that try to solve this problem by 'fencing off' the program from the outside. Firewalls allow you to restrict what programs can do on the network. Containers, etc. allow you to restrict which parts of your computer's file system may be accessed. The downside of those approaches is that they require you to do extra work: you need to figure out what a program needs and set up your firewalls/etc. correctly.
CloudABI goes in a different direction, by basically asking the following: what if programs were written in such a way that you can easily see from the outside how it's going to affect the world around it? With CloudABI you can design programs that sort of look like boxes that have plugs on the outside. If you want to run them, you first have to hook it up to cables. One of those cables could point to a file on disk, another one could point to a window on screen, etc. Programs can only communicate over those cables.
