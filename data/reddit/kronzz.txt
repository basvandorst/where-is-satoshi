I think you're taking the bitcoin advocate role a little too far lol.

Am I reading that fee website a linked incorrectly? This should have only taken 7 hours at 150 satoshis per byte?

According to  the fee level of 149sat/b should take around 7 hours, not nearly 100. Any ideas people? Losing faith in Bitcoin by the day at this point..

Starting to think we all are. Over a quarter trillion dollars in something that is barely functional.

What's it about then? Pretty sure those were two massive selling points for bitcoin as a technology. I really couldn't care less if this is 'decentralised and anonymous' if it takes 100 hours and costs me $16...

Appreciate this response. Doubling the fee to over $30 USD is insanity though.

It seems using literally any other method to transfer value between two places would be faster and cheaper....

The man gets my vote.

I've never actually used breadwallet (about to buy BTC today) but, if this is only a new feature, what is the 'send money' screen for? If not to send BTC to another wallet?

Currently have a transaction of $80 or so, paying $2.16 in fees (almost 3%), still not confirmed coming up to 24 hours later. Great system we got here.

Gotcha - thank you.
