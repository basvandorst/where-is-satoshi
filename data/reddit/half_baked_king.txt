Any way this can get a bump for better feedback? If there's a positive story out there I'd like to hear it. I know the BTC community hates anything that promotes alts but it didn't seem like a bad idea at the time.

I already registered for it on a whim but I haven't deposited anything. do you have any suggestions for a good wallet where I can actually buy portions of Bitcoins instead of having to spend the full amount? My Xapo will only like me buy full coins.

Care to elaborate?... I want to know things before I start investing. I currently have a Xapo wallet.

I feel like you guys should respond to a lot more threads about yourselves. Or do an AMA... All I've been hearing are bad things. If they aren't true - set that record straight, son!

Happy cake day! It's a Focus RS. Looked pretty new.  Had a rally kit or something. (Sorry for shitty pic).
@_date: 2019-03-05 03:14:35
I mean it does retail at around 40K, plus like I said he had a kit on it too.

Not everyone is made of money, no need to be a tool about it.

You must be really triggered at the fact that I'm sharing my shitty story because you've seemed to downvote all my comments and follow me from the only other thread I posted this in. It's for support. For advice. And to also spread awareness of the hype and actually doing better research before buying. Got anything better to do except this sort of thing?

I can only hope but since buying in the bullrush of holiday 2017, I've only gone downwards. That's why I basically threw in a 'donation' option in my post since I'm down on my luck. I could've spent the money better or all in just btc and might've been better off. I have a problem with keeping hope if you can't tell.
@_date: 2018-10-27 08:38:12
So what I threw in my wallet link... I don't expect anyone to do shit about it. Nobody just gives out btc lol. Again don't know why you care so much, or act like you know my current situation so well.

mai plângeți pentru mine, nu-mi pasă.
@_date: 2018-10-27 08:22:15
It's a legit story though, my dude. I basically threw away my Christmas money.

It seems like every time something good happens to them their price goes down haha. They got adopted by PornHub and MindGeek and still they tanked. That's real world application too... And that was after I bought XVG as well. I have more faith in Po.et because a blockchain for journalists actually makes sense. No censorship.

Ugh. Bots need to read titles too.

Newb here, give me your version of swing trading.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:09:18
I'm using BitMaker.
@_date: 2017-10-06 02:38:41
So far, I've supposedly yielded 0.00042000 BTC... If I wrote that properly.
EDIT: So $1.82 in a day... Haha.
