The website isn't part of bitcoin, like any other website, so no there is nothing official about it.
The people running the website are just immitating what that website would have been, it's an immitation game, and it will remain that. Pretending to be official would be pretty ironic coming from people arguing against Bcash for copying bitcoin.
