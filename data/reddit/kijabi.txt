So where is the "right guy" ?  Why aren't the execs talking?

So you're going to trust these incompetent fools?  And you're going to risk being hacked again?  You're as dumb as they are.  Expect Bitfinex to be "hacked" again, very soon.  Remember ShapeShift?  Hacked multiple times, think about it before you lose even more.

He's the fall guy for the execs.
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:08:59
14:15  - 14:40 - listen carefully to this guys question and listen carefully to Zane's response.

Taking ANY percentage of coin from one account and placing it in another is THEFT.  Their whole 36% haircut scheme is fraud.  They're going to jail.

Listen again fool, you were specifically asked whether corporate assets would be used to offset the loss and your reply was an angry no - and furthermore you whined about your own losses.  Fuck your loss, you and your cronies are arrogant incompetent fools that deserve to burn.

Show the numbers.
@_date: 2016-08-09 00:32:12
This, compounded by not a single word from their C-Level.
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:50:00
Then give a number, and give it fast because any iota of a reputation you might have had is disappearing fast.  What's the number?  What are you contributing?  Go to your team and get back here with a clear response and do it quickly.  You ALREADY reached a number of 36% haircut so if you can achieve that and be so certain about those numbers then you MUST be certain about your own numbers.  Why are you hiding those numbers?  Prove us wrong and REVEAL precisely what you are contributing!
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:40:13
Except this is not transparency, it's smoke and mirrors.
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:49:00
I don't see how any legit individual with a brain will continue to use Bitfinex - theft happened once, expect it to happen again.
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:23:06
Exactly, thieves are opportunists.  They had the keys, they had the means and $70 million is a lot of motive.
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:26:56
Equity is worthless when everyone bails.  Their offer of 'shares' is a joke. And what's to say it won't happen again when they turn it back on, remember ShapeShift and how many times they were hacked? 
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:11:02
If Bitfinex can reach the CONCLUSION that there will be a 36% haircut across all customer then they MUST KNOW what Bitfinex corporate is contributing to ffset losses - so instead of whining and arguing just tell us what those numbers are - and if you come back here and say you don't have them I will personally file multiple fraud reports with the FBI/SEC/FinCEN - you MUST have those loss offset numbers or how could you say it's a 36% haircut?
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:46:30
Bottom line - if you think this can't happen again with Bitfinex then you're delusional, they are incompetent fools.  Get your coin out as fast as humanly possible and stay out. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:34:57
They are making the numbers up, because if they weren't making the numbers up they would have already released the precise details around how they arrived at 36%.  What is Bitfinex contributing to offset customer losses?
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:45:44
No, it hasn't.  Where are the numbers?  They've released precisely zero evidence that they're offsetting losses.
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:32:21
Listen from [14:10 to 14:40]( very carefully.  Now wait for the big reveal.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:03:12
You've been asked multiple times, but I'll ask it one more time "What EXACTLY is Bitfinex contributing to offset the CUSTOMER loss?"  In the absence of this information I interpret your response as no contribution is forthcoming.
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:38:27
Was there an option for "ransomware" for the question what is your source of funds?
