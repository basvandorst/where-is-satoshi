Agreed. If the largest private tracker accepts bitcoin donations, why can't YOU?

I read the title and thought this would criticize all of the hoarders and savers. Glad I was wrong.

You are late to the party, at least, for us early adopters.
By some standards, you are a late adopter, by others, it's still early.
@_date: 2012-05-25 22:28:42
The downvotes are because you are extremely late to the party.

I can, PM me for details. I have good rep on the forums (tehzomb) and on  (tehzombro).

Since you use Dwolla, I'm assuming you live in the US. If you can write a check, try using CampBX.

Ah, gotcha :P
I came into this thread expecting to see like "omg I unplugged the fan by accident and it overheated" (I did that once btw, but no damage was done). Oh well. No heat intended :P

They're legit. I've had great experiences with them.

There's a spot in the market for a sportsbook with rewards programs, great customer support, and reputation, much like 5dimes or Heritage has. The thing about BTCSportsBet and Anonibet is that they're both very *basic*. Anonibet just looks unprofessional and goes down a lot. BTCSportsBet is very simple, only (for the most part) allowing full games ML/PL/Totals. On some bigger games there's halftime lines and player props, but that's it.
Obviously, the reputation problem can't be solved, unless backed up by a big player in the Bitcoin community (and not one surrounded by controversy).
If it were up to me, the perfect bitcoin book would be set up just like the regular offshore books. They'd take deposits/payouts in all the usual forms - WU, MG, Cashier's check, Wires, and add Bitcoin. The important thing to note here is that the thing keeping me using Offshore books and not using BTCSportsbet is the volatility of the BTC. A cool feature would be the option to have my account denominated in BTC or USD, and when I want to cash in/out, the conversion is performed on-the-fly.
As I said before, you could add different bets that the bigger books have, like quarter/period lines, player props, full season futures, etc (Anonibet is good with this but I still wouldn't trust them with a penny).
I did mention rewards programs. Not required, but certainly good for marketing and attracting recreational players. Some examples currently in use are:
* Betonline: 25% on first deposit (8x rollover req'ment).
* 5dimes: -105 juice on overnight lines
* 5dimes: 5/10/15/20% cash back on OVERALL losses for a period (5 for a week, up to 20 for half a year)
* Heritage: -108 juice for all
* Heritage: .4-.8% cash back on all risk money, win or lose (this really doesn't amount to much, but looks good in advertising)
* Naturally if you'll only accept bitcoin it won't be a problem, but for WU/MG a lot of books cover fees on larger deposit ($250-$300+)
Edit: also, while people will resent you for limiting sharps, you realistically should once you have a good customer base. if you don't, you'll go under quickly.

Can't agree more. This belongs on a self-help subreddit, not @_date: 2013-03-30 02:34:09
That's not an exchange. I don't know if OP wanted to list all ways to buy Bitcoins or not, but by the wording in the OP, coinbase should not be included.

I was referring to username/password.

They pay and they pay quickly. However, I'd only use them if Mt. Gox was much higher than US exchanges. You'll likely get more fiat out if you sell on a US exchange over time than instantly with FC4B.

Hope you type fast, Authy tokens are only good for 20 seconds.

I sucked it up and bought with Google Checkout... now I'm gonna extend with Bitcoin though. Thanks for adding support! You're helping Bitcoin gain the legitimacy it deserves.
Edit: Wow, I like how the verification with Bitcoin is instant. With Google Checkout it took around 15 minutes. This is nice!

Gotta love CBX. Nobody else takes deposit by personal check.
