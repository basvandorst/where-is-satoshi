Are you the man that owned those two awesome looking cats, one that was the tallest at like 19 inches, and the one with the longest tail? If you are, I read about that, it was such a tragedy. You have my deepest sympathy’s in any case.  I know I would be lost if I lost my dog.

Oh lord those cats were magnificent!  I want to get a Savannah or similar cat, but they can be quite expensive.  Were they indoor only kitties??  Again, you have my deepest sympathy on your loss.

Nooooo, 64,000,000+ Americans, plus 304 electoral college voters, put President Trump into office.  The MSM thinks that have control, but in the end, it’s Americans that do. ��

Obama is NOT the president, he’s a FORMER president.  America only has one president at a time.  The media suck ups suck at their job.  MSM still has their collective lips sewn directly to Obama’s ass.

This HODL shit is just that, shit.  Oil, gold, stocks don’t whipsaw back and forth with such velocity like Bitcoin does.  I mean this is like gambling or playing options on stocks, rocket up, rocket down.  NOT A REAL INVESTMENT.  PERIOD.

Wrong.  Many care about price as a store of value, ability to purchase, investment or wherever else drives them.  It’s ignorant to think the price is irrelevant, this is not some Holy Grail, this is a way to buy shit. The only way you can buy shit, is to have that shit be worth something, hence have value.  Preferably increasing.

You mean the love fest the media had for Obama &amp; Clinton?  Yeah, that shit was/is ������

Sorry bro but you are mistaken and high!  The US media was completely in love with Obama, and the US media now reports more than 90% negative stories on President Trump. It’s a fact Jack.
