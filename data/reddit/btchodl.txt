I'm just re-connecting, had some problems with my channels last night, but then I'll try out your new one. Yeh, you are literally the first BTC I ever spent :) I've got an idea for my own site, hoping to have it set up in the next couple of weeks but I don't have much free time :/

Did you send it as GBP? Or Eur?
When I was first testing out payments to CB I sent £10, and they sent me an email saying they couldn't accept it and I needed to provide proof to get it back (which I never bothered to do!) 
Sending EUR works fine, usually there next day.

You can close a channel whenever you like, regardless of the n-lock time and everything that's unspent will go to the return address in the transaction when the channel was opened.

You can't short on bakkt, only buy or sell a future. If you want to sell you gotta deliver the bitcoin. Sure, you could've borrowed that from someone else (blockfi??) but sooner or later you gotta buy it back!

They self-certify. It's a formality. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:12:32
I think basically yes, they have an equal number of shorts and longs and so just settle at whatever the +/-20% price is, then come back tomorrow. Seems there's an opportunity there for arbitrage  with 'physical' bitcoin as your losses are limited on one side of the trade and gains unlimited on the other. That said, when was the last time we had a 20% swing in a ~8hr period though?

I just hope we stay here until pay-day. Look, it's bad, real bad, but ONLY IF YOU NEED TO SELL. If you believed a week ago, you still believe now. China haven't banned BTC, they're adding regulatory controls for the on/off ramps and tbh we should accept that as their right. The situation in 80% of the world is exactly as it was a week ago so we should have dropped 20% TOPS. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:37:11
I'd like to know the same. Say, for instance, Coinbase stick with 2X (let's call it Chain 2, Core is Chain 1).....
- I buy 1BTC on Coinbase, which turn out to be Ch2 coins.
- I transfer to my wallet which has hitherto contained Ch1 coins.
What happens???
Can I replay the Coinbase transaction on Ch1 and get the coin? Do I even need to, do I even care?
I get if I buy something on Ch1 from someone unscrupulous they could replay on Ch2 but, again, do I even care if to me Ch1 is 'bitcoin'?

Mind-blowing, this ended so much better than it could have.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:02:07
Not possible I don't think, but should be able to do it via GDAX with little/no loss. GBP-&gt;BTC-&gt;Euro.
You might want to look at fire.com for your Euro withdrawals, you get a SEPA account in your own name and I've successfully withdrawn from Coinbase. You can then bounce that out to Revolut to get to GBP for the mid-market rate. 
The whole thing will take a few days but the only fee you'll pay is 0.15% to Coinbase!

I agree, certainly for the use-case of store/exchange of value I don't see anything 'replacing' bitcoin. Game Theory, particularly Nash Equilibria very much applies here (this is also the reason why hard forks are likely to fail).

I can give you some background on XBT as I hold some (alongside 'physical' bitcoin)
XBT (rebranding as Coinshares) have two Bitcoin products, one denominated in Euro and one in SEK.
You're not buying bitcoin, as such, but a 'share' which effectively tracks the price of bitcoin. For each share you buy XBT hold the same amount of bitcoin through a sister company. 
I have some of these shares as I can have it in my pension in the UK which has some tax benefits, you pay 2.5% per year management charge so unless you can realise some tax advantages you're probably better off just learning how to hold bitcoin in your own wallet. Or you might think 2.5% per year to not have to worry about this is a good deal! 
Hope this helps!
*edit* I should say, 1 unit of XBT is NOT 1 Bitcoin, it's something like 1/20th currently but you can't properly map one to the other as the management fee is taken by reducing the value of the share.
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:21:52

Check out Uphold. They accept GBP via SEPA and there's no max funding amount. You'll pay 0.0075% over mid-market rate, which is often cheaper than the Coinbase buy price. You'll then pay 0.0007BTC (a couple of dollars) to transfer out to your wallet. I've been seriously impressed so far.

Uphold has been good - and no problem with liquidity you could buy £1m right now for about £100 over mid-market rate if you wanted! I would transfer them straight out though.

1- yes, very (but take care writing your seed word down) 
2- you can't send money, you not cryptos, and remember you're not sending it _to_ your Trezor, you're sending it to an address on the blockchain so it takes as long as that takes. 
3- I think Coinbase/GDAX wait for 4/6 confirmations, so maybe an hour before you can trade.

It's an Exchange Traded Note, listed on the Swedish (I think?) NASDAQ. It's 100% hedged to BTC (so for every purchase of the ETN there's an equivalent purchase of BTC on the exchanges).

There's a couple of problems with this. 1- Coinbase don't accept GBP SEPA deposits, so you have to pay an expensive conversion. 2- Coinbase charge you their (3% is it?) commission on the BTC purchase. 3- the EUR/GBP markets on GDAX, and therefore Coinbase buy prices, are far less liquid than USD.
All told, I've been saving 4/5% at least buying through Uphold.
