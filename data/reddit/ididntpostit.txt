You really shouldn't be looking for quick profits from cryptos. This is a long game still. Sure, its smart to pull out some short term profits in order to b cement them, but you gotta hodl for the real stuff. Think about what that cash could be in 3 years if bitcoin goes to 35k or 50k?

I'm a newbie, and this is awesome! Can you imagine if all your other moneypit hobbies suddenly got cheaper the second you discovered them? 
Just bought more!

Is English really the common language here though? 
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:29:57
Not sure you understood my comment, I was saying English isn't the common language like batman was implying

Who pays for our current welfare system? Who paid for all the subsidies that when to Walmart and Amazon?
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:36:26
If corporate greed doesn't scare you, youre a fuckin moron
@_date: 2019-03-17 22:02:12
Oh honey...you honestly think the phrase "Mccarthy-ism" means a good thing? Let me know, is ignorance bliss?
@_date: 2019-03-17 06:41:48
Our government currently subsidises big business with tax payer money. Corps like Amazon and Google pay less in traxes than I do yet get huge handouts. 
How are people earning welfare in its current form? 
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:07:38
Except that 12k/yr will have zero effect on inflation. The money won't be just printed from nothing. Research before calling someone else ignorant and buzzing "VENEZUELA" like every other shill here.
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:25:45
Nope. Go use Google. He explains exactly where the money would come from. Start there.
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:20:55
One form of an idea "failing" doesn't equal the entire idea failing. That's irrational.
@_date: 2019-03-17 15:04:30
No that's due to cost of living increasing faster than minimum wage because companies cut corners for profits 
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:30:46
First sentence isnt even a close to logical argument. Taxing the rich up to like 90% is literally how this country used to work. Also it's clear you haven't informed yourself on Yang's plan at all. 
He plans to scrap the current welfare programs in favor of UBI. 
We're already heavily taxing the poor and middle class to hand out freebies to billionares. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:09:29
Can you explain why UBI is bullshit?
@_date: 2019-03-22 00:50:38
So you have $600 a month left over for utilities, car payment, car insurance, gas, groceries, cell phone bill, internet? 
Youre delusional man. And apparently pretty racist. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:12:52
Thanks for being one of the few reasonable people in this thread 
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:22:58
How do people like you get so worked up without actually reading or listening to what this guy says? Your claims and questions show that you clearly haven't.
@_date: 2019-03-22 12:50:18
No its not. It's due the minimum wage staying stagnant for decades while COL skyrocketed.  How can you just ignore historical pricing data vs. COL?  50 years ago, you could work a couple minimum wage jobs and own your own home. 
Your argument basically says that if your poor, the only way to stop being poor is to quit one of your jobs, PAY to learn a new skill, and then cross your fingers that you can compete in a higher level job market.
People below the poverty line don't have time or money to do that because they are working 3 jobs just to afford cost of living expenses.
Your solution might have worked 30 years ago, but our economy is way too broken at this point to just tell people to lift themselves up by their boot straps. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:10:20
Good thing that's not what is being argued here
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:15:46
He's proposing changing the current wealth distribution to the people instead of to the top 1% like it is now. Go read his book 
@_date: 2019-03-17 15:19:13
Asked a question, didn't make a statement. Cute though. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 02:12:07
OK so in your cherry picked/blended fictional scenerio.. 600-100-80= $420 a month left. You didn't mention car insurance, or cable/internet, or groceries, or gas. 
Please tell me what fake numbers you can come up with that won't leave you in debt at the end of every month in the $500 a month rental in California :p 
If you're argument is that human beings can survive in an impoverished situation then youre too stupid to continue having a convo with...
Then again I see you regularly post at T_d so it's pretty clear how much of an idiot you are.
WTF is a soy boy? 
@_date: 2019-03-17 06:50:17
That's a flawed premise because the wealthy hide their money no matter what. For fun though go look at the USA before Reagan fucked everything. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:13:33
Just another uninformed righty
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:31:43
Right. To redistribute it back to the people who earn it, rather than to billionares like the current system does.
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:08:35
I'm pretty shocked at how many corporate bootlickers are on this sub 
@_date: 2019-03-17 15:02:10
I just gave you two examples. And we have an $800 billion welfare system right now that is paid for by tax payer money. You don't seem very informed 
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:09:13
Minimum wage doesn't get you a $500 a month rental. Your argument of extremes is pretty ignorant.
@_date: 2019-03-17 15:03:09
So you support the current system as it is? 
@_date: 2019-03-17 15:18:06
1.  
2. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:16:34
Slippery slope much? Yelling commie just makes it look like you don't understand words.
@_date: 2019-03-17 06:39:17
Wake up buddy. Corporations own our government, unchecked. You're fearmomgering is just bootlicking.
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:04:08
You must either not be paying attention or you don't care that a huge portion of our "productive" population doesnt see any real economic benefit from their work when compared to the top 1% of wealth holders. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:07:39
Do ATMs earn money? What about self-checkout machines? What about robotic assembly lines? As technology advances and production becomes increasingly automated, who earns that money? 
@_date: 2019-03-17 10:11:54
"The dumb and poor" yeesh.. You have some serious classist problems with your thinking there bud.
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:55:19
Lol gold? What century do you think it is?
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:26:52
Did you say Bc
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:54:44
Bringing up the gold standard isnt really reason
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:44:26
Omg...5 whole figures?! 
I honestly can't tell now if you're trolling or not lol. Such cringe if not
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:06:14
What "argument"? Recommending that people check their partisan bias isn't an argument, it's basic fucking logic. LOL Youre adorably bad at trolling.
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:54:46
Yeah that's fair ha
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:03:13
Warnings of recession bad 
Concentration camps really bad 
Trade wars maybe bad 
World peace? This is only one that's actually pure BS.
Propaganda bad. Two sides to every story
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:52:00
True...especially with such a high IQ
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:56:58
LOL. The tarrifs have been in place for like a month...they haven't done anything yet. That's not how an economy works dude. The economy has been growing since 2014. 
I'm all for safe borders and cracking down HARD on illegal immigration, but we are LITERALLY running concentration camps right now. If you don't think we are, you're a delusional idiot...regardless of your political leanings.
Trade war =! War...Im not sure you understand the concepts youre taking about. I'm also not against the tarrifs or the trade war...Im very interested in how Trumps approach might work. Our economy was flourishing when the federal government got 90% of its revenue from tarrifs...however that was before Nixon fucked the global economy by taking us off the gold standard.
The "Korean War" ended 70 years ago...the tensions did not...and they still haven't. I dont have any issues with the way Trump is dealing with NK actually. His foreign policy is fresh and might make a difference. 
That being said, what fucking planet do you live on where the Syrian war is over, and in what universe do 2 wars "ending" = world peace. 
Try actually reading my post genius. You clearly don't have ANY perspective outside your own bias. My post literally said there are 2 sides to every story, so be careful of propaganda...and you respond with partisan propaganda? 
Wake up.
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:54:16
Damn. You got me. You REALLY took apart my point with that one dude. How do you even walk around with a brain that big?? 
But seriously, you're a massive fucking idiot. Someone says "examine your bias" and you say it's illogical and leftist. What a pathetic small world you live in.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:06:32
I don't think it's really possible to apologize ENOUGH for all the terrible shit America has done/is doing.  We can be proud of the great things we've done and be ashamed of our terrible actions at the same time
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:38:24
Well considering that all happened within 2 months ago.,.you should probably reevaluate why you bought in. Its a long term investment, not a get rich quick scheme. Judging an emerging market based on its infancy stages is wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:06:56
Yes..reddit memes are responsible for killing bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:59:04
This is NOT a good thing guys. Certainly not the kind of adoption we want...this is a government trying to scam USD. Its money laundering.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:07:23
Right, I got all that from your post...you have to realize that you're judging based off of such a small window of time that you aren't paying attention to how early market stages work. 
You bought a long term investment, yet you thought it was going to make you instant money. Stop thinking this way. Write off every cent you invest as lost and forget about it...then in 5-10 years you'll either have still lost it, or will have made a wonderful profit. If you think about it any other way, you'll lose your mind and money.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:34:48
Its like a 5 year old tried to understand long term investments, and is mocking OTHER people for being ignorant.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:49:45
Yeah its pretty clear you aren't the kind of person who likes understanding things lol
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:35:05
I live near Washington DC and there are countless places that will accept bitcoin directly. 
Why are you playing stupid? You know for a fact that what you just said was wrong.
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:21:34
Hasnt been going anywhere?? Do you live under a rock? It's value has skyrocketed faster than any method of exchange in history.
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:26:43
So i can't use it to buy anything?
