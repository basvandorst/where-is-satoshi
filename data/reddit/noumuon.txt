Well, telling a story is no different, unless you want to tell me that Harry Potter is a true to life account of a fine young wizard put through unfortunate circumstances.
Telling a story and claiming it real, though, is different, as the whole "claiming it real" part specifically sets up that expectation.

$0.60 transaction fees aren't making bitcoin worse than anything else. It's somewhat funny watching all this go down, because a lot of the ideals and perceived promises of bitcoin simply don't mesh with reality. Aside from what bitcoin explicitly is, interactions with bitcoins will largely remain the same as every other currency. People don't exchange things for idealistic perceptions... they exchange things for profit. Fear and greed run everything.

There's effectively no difference. The community is still saying "You can't do this" and forcing a hand.
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:46:30
No. On a general basis there's no difference. All you're doing is looking at superficial excuses as to why your way is right, but you're fundamentally attempting to do the same thing. That's where the few differences in practice come from, your only hope at stopping whatever behavior you personally deem unacceptable is based on chance -- and most likely isn't going to win out in the face of greed.

False. Monopoly/stable oligopoly is the logical conclusion in the absence of regulation. Regulation can exist as a support to these things, but ideally for the consumer, regulation exists to prevent them (anti-trust laws, etc). Regulation itself is a benign word that isn't biased for or against any of this. It is what it's written to be.
I would wager, based on the trends of this subreddit, you're purposely conflating all types of regulation together -- ready to cherry pick instances where regulation supports monopoly/oligopoly -- to conclude all regulation is bad.

perhaps it's something specific to bitcoins use of SHA-256 and while he was researching possible vulnerabilities in bitcoin he found some minor things about SHA-256. the article does specifically state he calls them "scratches in the paintwork," implying the vulnerabilities aren't that significant.
to me it seems some people have become so defensive of bitcoin that the little response in this thread is what's sensational, as opposed to the actual claims he's making.

it's not due to bitcoin. that's the price of the cards.
@_date: 2011-06-10 20:19:31


that's actually exactly what i do. i game most of the time, but if i'm not in a game or some other GPU intensive application (i make games for fun), then i have a miner running. the only thing i've noticed that affects the hash rate is if i watch something using flash. i've never tried not pausing the miner during a game - i can't stand any fps drop, but at the very least, you could probably use task manager to lower the priority on your miner, though that might just be cpu priority. it's worth experimenting though, if you want, with games + miner to see what happens.
with a 4670, i'm not sure what type of hash rate you'd get, but at the very least, it's worthwhile to get a GPU miner, join a pool and earn some bitcoin while you're not directly using your video card.
@_date: 2011-06-07 18:57:05
seems like a bad analogy. nobody's asking people to learn the cryptographic underpinnings of the bitcoin protocol (a very large majority of people who use bitcoin already don't fully understand it). though i agree the UI needs some serious improvement.

anonymity is concealing the name/identity/source. you *could* argue that the public key is a source, but given that any wallet can generate all the keys it wants, i'm less than inclined to believe that the public key does not represent anonymity.

the other specs on your computer do not matter at all if you're GPU mining. 
as far as the netbook goes, CPU mining isn't really worth it. how much CPUs scale isn't really proportional to how well they perform with hashing. i have a 2ghz single core processor that i tried CPU mining with, and i would get about 700 khash/s. my current 6 core AMD at 3.3ghz only gets 9 mhash/s with all six cores going.
GPU mining, on the other hand, is great. my current GPU i have by happenstance when my old GPU (ati 4890) died under warranty. it was replaced with an ati 5830. the 5830, which is a single core clocked at 800 mhz GPU and 1000 mhz gRAM, gets about ~140 mhash/s without any tweaking. overclocked to 900mhz GPU and 1150 mhz gRAM, it gets ~180 mhash/s without any tweaking to the software miner ... that's 30 mhash/s with a small overclock compared to ~8 mhash/s with a drastic CPU change. the 5830 i have itself only costs ~$160, and some you can find around $100. the problem with the netbook and its GPU is that netbooks don't have a proper discrete GPU. they're integrated, and depending on how old it is, could require jumping through hoops to get open cl or cuda running (if at all) for low performance.
tl;dr: making a GPU mining rig for a few hundred dollars will far outperform your netbook.
@_date: 2011-03-25 00:45:44
those 100 accounts would each add their own Mhash/s to the overall figure thusly decreasing the chance for each node to be successful.

i'm currently pool mining with 2 old single core CPUs due to problems with my main computer (have an ati 5830 i can use as well when i'm not gaming, though i can only do so on weekends). to make 50 bitcoins even in a pool would take years at the rate i'm acquiring them.
@_date: 2011-03-29 23:07:54
every one of the issues you bring up rests on the truth of the proposition "you publish your bitcoin wallet ID". a secret swiss bank account that you use to get around income tax isn't a secret if you publish the account. the system itself is anonymous, but that doesn't mean that anonymity isn't tied to something. there is virtually no transaction system that can be entirely anonymous if you consider the participant disclosing their own information or the consideration of "snooping" on suspects.

yea, i mentioned that, but they could make it infeasible to obtain all of them even with finite precision in a reasonable amount of time. i'm just not sure exactly what their long term plans really are. i can see with the current setup it taking an astronomically long time to mine all the coins.

that's only your inference. nothing about the grammar of the phrase "using Silk Road" necessarily implies what you state.

is it possible to mine them all? i thought the actual figure was an asymptotic figure where after infinite time there will be that amount. though, i'm not really sure what they plan on doing with adding more decimal places - not doing so would make my statements irrelevant.
@_date: 2011-03-25 00:55:00
sure, if a single entity had the majority of the processing power, he would have a considerably higher probability of acquiring the majority that are being distributed over a given time. it won't cause the coins to be distributed any faster, though. the only way i can possibly see how having more bitcoins will lead to a greater ability to acquire them is if you can sell them for more than you can buy them for using another currency.
what i meant, though, was that if they continue to extend the decimal place for bitcoins, then there will never be the theoretical maximal amount of coins in circulation.
@_date: 2011-07-12 04:24:21


i wouldn't imagine you would be. people like to put their own suppositions all over the place. english is also hard, apparently.

considering that half of your posts on this article and the article mention the supposed detriment this has to the image of bitcoin, i'm less than inclined to believe you.
hate to break it to you, but there's very little need to have a technical discussion on TOR, bitcoin or anonymity in an article like this. this is a little post about someone's experience buying drugs on silk road. if you blow it out of proportion any more, japan's going to combust from radiation.

But seriously, that's a bold claim. If we're talking brute force, with extremely cold temperatures and large amounts of energy it simply becomes a matter of enough silicon, so to speak.
That's ignoring that we can already do better than brute force against AES (edit: according to known research -- the NSA currently employs many very talented mathematicians whose likely sole job is to examine cryptography schemes looking for weaknesses, and you'd better believe they wouldn't publish any findings). Currently what's known is not that much better, but you're making the assumption that no further mathematical advancements will change this. That seems like a pretty bad assumption to make.

No. Correlation is very easy if they are monitoring both sides regardless of the quantity of traffic, and it's extremely easy with very little necessary data to mathematically correlate the packet streams. This is one of the downsides to using TOR as well.
If the NSA is really sniffing packets before and after the VPN, there's nothing you can do except where the VPN or TOR-like service does something else to the packets like another round of encryption and adding in randomizations to the timing of the stream going out.
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:17:21
I'm not that much of a masochist yet to presently consider it fun.
@_date: 2013-07-04 01:57:54
If the NSA can see the streams going into the VPN and out of the VPN, then depending on what you're doing, it doesn't matter if it's encrypted or not. They can still correlate you to the outgoing stream very easily. 
So if you're talking over an encrypted IM service to someone, assuming enough points where they can sniff packets, the NSA could know who you're talking to, just not what's being said. In cases of terrorists and whatnot, this is pretty important. It establishes who is associated with who. In most cases for most of us here, it's not as important, and the encryption would give us the privacy we're looking for. Whether or not the DEA could use the NSA's facilities and equipment for drug busts is a different concern for those who buy drugs over TOR or through VPNs and such, but we've yet to see any busts that would indicate such a thing. It seems the DEA has just stockpiled a bunch of Bitcoin for that.
Of course, there's also the issue Lighthat brought up, in that you'd better hope that whatever country your VPN is in isn't also spying on its people and/or cooperating with the US government (i.e. definitely don't get a VPN out of England).
