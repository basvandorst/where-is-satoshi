Is that the only solution?
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:09:08
Very good point, maybe you should get in touch with them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:15:55
Yes this is possible. 
That being said, having your private keys on multiple devices is not advisable security wise.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:57:23
You need your private key to write a new transaction and it is stored in your wallet. 
Best of luck with your tx mate.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:48:20
You have two options, you can Replace by fee or wait. If you wait it may confirm at some point but if it does not get confirmed in two weeks your coins will come back.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:26:30
You paid 112033 satoshis (~500/byte) for your transaction and currently TXs with 1000 sat / byte get mined. You can do a Replace by fee and put a fee of $35-40 if you want it to confirm now.
Check the current fee level [here](
Edit: typo.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:34:40
No worries mate, we are here to help.
Quick overview, fees are proportional to the data to be processed (often expressed here in Bytes), the amount to transfer is actually irrelevant. For example you could pay 100 people in one transaction (with 100 different outputs), which would be a big tx and be expensive to process (amount transacted is still irrelevant).
Whether you withdraw 30 or 30k, fees will be the same.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:59:04
Yes that gives bad first UX for new users.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:23:36
You need to withdraw more BTC in one go to make it economical sense or you can wait for the fees to go down.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:41:08
Yes Replace by Fee is great because you can rewrite the tx if the network is congested.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:11:15
Give us your tx id young man.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:43:19
In electrum, can you right click on the tx and select "increase fee"? Try 2.1mBTC.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:35:02
What wallet are you using?

When did Bitmain premine bcash? I thought Bitmain just continued to mine both chains after the fork.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:54:48
When do you think it would be a good time to start to increase the block size?
Edit: typo
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:15:21
How do we know what's the best size? and more importantly how do we agree on this in a decentralized manner (like in a self regulated system untouched by human bias)?

Well done boys !!!!!!

It has been said repeatedly here that for the time being BTC isn't good to transact. You should use other coins until the situation gets back to normal
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:19:59
BTC 1st Jan @ 1000
BTC now 
BCH now @ 600
Compounded annual return: 938%
Time to get to 1,000,000: 2 years and 22 days 
(using conservative assumptions)

Miners under normal conditions currently mine about 1800 bitcoins per day (excl. fees for simplicity) that won't move the neddle by much given trading volumes. Even if that would make a difference, they also have to wait 100 blocks before spending the rewards (2/3 of a day).

I read his books, this guy nailed it on so many points it's incredible, yet he is just ignored completely by mainstream econo-missed. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:05:24
This thread looks like the wailing wall :).
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:21:22
Mining it won't really pump the price, price is determined by people buying and selling it. Miners are just there to run network to confirm transaction.

Koreans are waking up.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:49:31
This has to do with the slow DAA of Bitcoin, any shitcoins can quickly adjust to swings in hashpower. That should have been addressed long ago but we were too busy fighting each other.
FUD gets stimulated by roughly anything (China, Dimon, etc), I would not necessarily blame the miners for that one.
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:09:27
In Bitcoin we trust.

They "said" they would stop signaling after they restart their servers, so far they are still signaling "NYA" in the coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-17 08:55:45
Didn't see that one coming from Ver, albeit Bitcoin.com is only ~2% of the hashrate.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:12:36
So is its support by miners [-&gt; xbt](

Volume is very low though.

Why did you pick GDP (economic output) as opposed to Monetary Base (M1, M2, etc)?

Yeah, if you dig in deeper you'll find some crazy stuff about super big blocks as if space does not matter. They also can't stop going on about adoption.
