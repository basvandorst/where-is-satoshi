He thinks Bitcoin dies if it doesn't scale, so he's saying the options are only three:
1. Bitcoin doesn't scale and dies.
2. Bitcoin scales and maintains decentralization, which is his preference.
3. Bitcoin scales and becomes centralized.
He prefers 3 over 1.

My understanding is that the bill they helped craft and push would have been very beneficial for the industry, until a particular agency made some fundamental changes that made it something they now oppose. 
I can't speak for them but I think their approach is "we will see regulations eventually so we want to help guide the process in a positive way instead of being left to chance." 
I have a lot of faith in Brito and his group. Judging the efficacy of non-profits is notoriously difficult, so there's nothing wrong with questioning their decisions and trying to determine what their track record looks like. In my assessment, we're better off with them than without them.

Ebay (and probably most ecommerce platforms in the western world) bans the sale of North Korean stamps and money, as well as other goods. They don't want any chance of running up against Office of Foreign Assets Control rules (or similar rules in other countries).

Opposing Bitlicense didn't work. EFF, Coin Center, the bitcoin foundation weren't able to stop regulation in the financial capital of the world. 
I agree it would be better to have no Bitlicense, but it didn't happen. Should we shut down EFF and the foundation?

Wasn't the original California bill a complete copy of the New York bitlicense? That's the baseline that Coin Center started with. It seems dishonest to make it sound like they pushed for the bill from the start when they pushed to change a bad bill from the start (and succeeded).

Choosing to support, or not support, a non-profit that focuses on policy-making based on a single policy example seems unwise. We're dealing with the government here, an institution which has all the wrong incentives and can be incredibly arbitrary and capricious. If you choose to engage them, you're never going to come out 100% happy.
You can argue that non-profits which engage with policy-makers shouldn't exist at all, or should only fight against any regulation. That's a different argument than determining the efficacy of an organization who has chosen the engagement strategy.
My view is that we should worry more about building the technical foundations of systems that take more control away from the existing powerful institutions and not worry about changing the increasingly obsolete policy-makers' opinions about us. But I'm glad someone is trying to do it on the off chance it sometimes works and gives the creators more breathing room.

In the US (and many western countries) they prevent their citizens from engaging in trade with certain countries, like North Korea. So online ecommerce platforms simply don't allow you to buy or sell their stuff. Ebay started banning those sales in 2013, and other platforms have followed suit.

I recommend using for these types of questions, you'll get more specific responses there, and won't test the patience of people in this sub who don't care about OB.
The answer to your question: OB is actually two pieces of software, the server and the client. The server can be run from command line, though it mostly is controlled by the client at this point. If people want more detailed command line controls, it's open source so they can submit a PR for that.

We *did* do this for free for a year before getting VC money. And even then it's for the company OB1 not OpenBazaar itself. We've taken that money and poured it into development for OpenBazaar.
We've kept it 100% open source and never did crowdfunding or an appcoin or anything like that. If OB fails then the VCs lose money and we lose our jobs but nobody in the community loses anything.
Also $1 million isn't "a ton of money" when you're talking about paying full-time developers.

OpenBazaar itself doesn't aim to do anything, just like Bitcoin doesn't aim to do anything. Bitcoin is a protocol and network for p2p money, and OpenBazaar is a protocol and network for p2p trade.
Now the people who created OB certainly have goals, and the people who are using it do as well. But I'm sure the goals aren't uniformly shared, just as they aren't in the Bitcoin space either.
I agree that mass adoption wouldn't be easy in its current form, but it will improve over time, and I don't personally believe that mass adoption (however that is defined) is the only metric for success. Bitcoin doesn't really have mass adoption either, but it's still something worthwhile.

Anyone can run a seed server. It's only for bootstrapping. Bitcoin runs the same way.
There's a difference in saying that an organization runs the network, and that an organization has influence over the code.
Clearly the devs who work on Bitcoin Core don't run the Bitcoin network. But they definitely have immense influence over the most commonly used implementation of the Bitcoin code.
Both Bitcoin and OpenBazaar are completely open source and not controlled by any organization. That's not a controversial statement.

The cache.pickle deleting trick shouldn't be necessary after 1.1.3, just FYI.
@_date: 2016-04-17 16:01:55
**Short answer**: Yes, OpenBazaar will be accessible via a web browser, and you can see early attempts with sites like [bazaarbay.org](
**Long answer**: The OpenBazaar network itself isn't based on HTTP, so you cannot directly use a web browser to host stores, visit them, or engage in trade.
This is the same as the Bitcoin blockchain, or bittorrent. 
What ends up happening is third party services pop up that bridge that gap. In Bitcoin there are tons of websites that let you view and access the blockchain, and there are also many websites that provide services for bittorrent users.
These services will exist for OpenBazaar as well.
Also, the same is true for mobile.

Since it's decentralized there are always peers joining and leaving, and getting an exact number of nodes or listings is difficult.
[Duosear.ch]( has a good crawling system, and as of this moment there are ~2.3k listings online (they only count online listings).
It's two and a half weeks old, so we're pretty happy with that number. The OpenBazaar store alone has had over 200 orders already.

Ah, that's about blockchain IDs. Since the GUID in OpenBazaar isn't memorable we allow people to optionally tied it to a blockchain ID (using blockstack) which is easier for navigation.

This is good feedback, but here's the thing: There isn't really a "they" when you're talking about OpenBazaar.
It's an open source project like Bitcoin. There's no organization running it, but it's made up of everyone running the software.
So every time you say "they should" consider say "we should" instead. It definitely won't succeed if everything is put on the original dev team, just like Bitcoin wouldn't have succeeded if Satoshi was required to make every improvement to the code.

For one thing, it's not reliant on DNS censorship.

How do you know that? He was never charged with this and therefore he was never able to defend himself. Who knows what his side of the story would be? All we know is what the government told us, and don't forget there were at least two corrupt federal agents collecting this evidence.


He set up a website where people bought and sold drugs to each other. Not the same thing as a cartel boss, at all.


So you want to make the utilitarian argument? How about this: He also allowed thousands of people to get their drugs online instead of off the street _for years_. How much violence did that prevent?
Also, the quality of Silk Road drugs was much better than street. How many overdoses or poisonings did Silk Road prevent with higher quality?
The Silk Road was good for society and the fact that Ross was sentenced to two life terms without parole for _non-violent crimes_ is an absolute travesty.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:06:34
He barely participated in the actual sale of drugs at all. He operated the marketplace where people voluntarily exchanged goods and services with each other, which is their fundamental human right to do.
100 years ago what he did would have been legal and 100 years from now I'm almost certain what he did would be legal, but we live in a unique period now where people have accepted that they don't have the right to control their own bodies and that prohibition is a necessary function of government.
It's bullshit and people like Ross who worked to end the injustice of the war on drugs are heroes in my book.

Yes, we are integrating a few altcoins. Bitcoin fees are a problem for many of our users and they've asked for alternatives. That doesn't mean we're abandoning bitcoin.

I'm not arguing what he did was legal. Only that it's not the same morally as an actual cartel boss, not in the slightest.


Of course it will. The history of humanity is a history of drug use. Legalization is becoming more common and I'm confident full legalization will happen with 100 years, likely within 50.

No you back up the hardware wallet seed by writing it down on paper and storing it off-site. If you lose the hardware or it's stolen then you can just get another wallet and use the same seed to restore it.

Bisq and OpenBazaar are truly decentralized. Peers are equal in the network with no central point of control.

No it didn't. Our first build was a fork of Dark Market, and we never took that code base all the way to completion, for various reasons.

Define circle jerk. In forums like this people demonstrate preference by engaging in discussion or voting up or down. They don't seem to agree with your sensibilities.
@_date: 2015-12-19 19:03:30
You don't believe there is significant overlap between bitcoin and the actions of the US Federal government? And that many of those interested in bitcoin are also interested in discussing how it relates to those actions? 
Take a look around the subreddit. You may not like it, but many (most?) bitcoiners care about bitcoin not just because of the technology or currency  but because of the ideological and/or political implications. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:32:41
It's a good question. I expect if it's a moderated transaction that each moderator could have their own best practices for establishing proof of delivery.
If it's not moderated then ideally they use some service that delivers content upon payment.

Release OpenBazaar and help aid the growth of decentralized trade. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 19:28:45
That's untrue. I'm not coming to this issue from another standpoint and stuffing bitcoin into it. I've been involved with bitcoin for years; read through that blog or my comment history. 
Bitcoin offers an alternative for people concerned about the surveillance state. It's worth discussing. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 00:01:37
It's definitely better. Still not perfect. If you find a problem, open an issue on Github or post on @_date: 2015-12-08 22:33:10

Eventually, using OpenBazaar will be another option. Hopefully just a few more months.
@_date: 2015-06-12 07:21:07
We totally agree, and try to make clear that our beta is for testing only and it's not close to being ready for regular consumers.
However, with the funding we've received, team we've put together, the interest we've gotten from the announcement, and the developer community alongside us, I'm confident the protocol, network, and client are going to improve rapidly.

Brad Burnham, from one of our investors, USV, just wrote a blog post that might help answer this:

Anyone looked at this key for validity?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:58:33


You really can't see how a company dealing with 100k new users _per day_ would have more difficulty rolling out a huge change to their system than your system which almost no one is using?
If you screw up then there are basically no consequences, if Coinbase screws up they stand to lose millions of dollars and their reputation.
I didn't bring up OpenBazaar but dude, what's your beef? Sure there are scammers on OpenBazaar, just like literally every single other marketplace on the internet (expect maybe ones that have no users).
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:24:21
Exactly. I think no fees is the biggest selling point here. It's actual *free* trade!
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:27:14
We worked on this for a year as volunteers, because we wanted *decentralized* markets to exist. We wouldn't take money unless we absolutely knew that investors understood, and agreed with, our vision.
Read Brad Burnham's post (our lead investor from USV) on the subject:
 
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:03:20
This may help you understand:
@_date: 2015-06-11 21:57:59
There is no central server to run. OpenBazaar is a protocol and network that is decentralized. Everyone runs their own store. That's why there are no fees.

Thanks! We're very excited.
@_date: 2015-12-11 10:38:19
It's similar in structure to the Bittorrent network. There is no central point of control. The government could shut it down the same way they could - in theory - shut down the Bittorrent network: By going to each individual user and shutting down their computers.
Of course I believe governments will have no reason to attack the network at large, only individual users on the network who break the law. This isn't a new version of the Silk Road where the whole point is illicit trade; this is online commerce without the middleman.
Most Bittorrent users are behind VPNs and OpenBazaar works behind VPNs as well.
It doesn't use Tor.
@_date: 2015-06-11 22:31:26
It's not your body I worry about; it's your mind. Too much awesome to take at once.
Just wait a while. It's all coming in good time.

Bitcoin companies are offering their centralized services on a decentralized platform. We're doing the same thing.
Better to have a decentralized platform with optional centralized services than a centralized platform with - obviously not optional - centralized services!
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:35:13
Listings do allow location in OpenBazaar. It's optional. If you'd rather use the postal system instead of a dead drop in the crevice of a tree, you can do that. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 18:20:58
Not yet; we're focused on making the product (and network) much stronger before we approach non-Bitcoiners. We view Bitcoin users as the initial target market and hope to get most of the Bitcoin community using OpenBazaar as the default method for buying and selling goods and services.
Only once it's been shown to work well do we plan on trying to expand beyond that. Of course it's an open network, so anyone can join at any time!
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:13:36
Just be aware that blog post entries can easily be faked in terms of their date.
Unless there's a reliable caching of that page from that date, then that's very weak evidence.

I really don't care about pushing people away from bitcoin if it means the alternative is being afraid to promote the aspects which make it unique. 
There is a libertarian ideology behind bitcoin and it empowers people who want more privacy in their financial and commercial transactions. 
This is hardly a unique opinion in this subreddit. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:48:18
We just released the 5th beta version, but please be aware that it is still in beta and only for testing. You're not likely to have a good experience if you try to run an ecommerce store on OpenBazaar yet.
Eventually, it'll be like other ecommerce platforms, except there's no middlemen, so it's cheaper and more private. We're getting there slowly.
@_date: 2018-08-02 03:08:56

If there are such addresses out there, then it's more likely we'll look at it. But you still have to trust the humans who own the addresses to not game the system.
Also, proof of burn isn't so bad - the coins burned make everyone else's coins more valuable.

Hey everyone, Sam Patterson here, I help out on the OpenBazaar project. Great to see folks are excited about this.
Let me clear up a few things:
1. OpenBazaar is a fork of Dark Market. Amir and the unsystem folks weren't continuing development of Dark Market, so Brian Hoffman forked it and development continues. The Dark Markets folks have pointed people towards OpenBazaar, and even set up a portion of their forums for us to use, they support the project.
2. Auctions and other nifty ideas have been proposed, but it's not certain they will be incorporated, at least not for some time. The biggest hurdle at this point isn't good ideas, lots of smart people are contributing those, but development. A few folks are contributing here and there, but Brian Hoffman is doing the bulk of the work.
3. This is not a trivial project, and needs a larger development team. The proof of concept Dark Market was awesome, but it wasn't anywhere near being usable, especially at scale. Creating a decentralized market means the creation of a web of trust for reputation, incorporating multisig and arbitration, Ricardian contracts, searching across a distributed system, and all kinds of difficult problems. One or two people can't really do it all, so we need help.
If you want to contribute, visit the [Github page]( to find out more. You can always help with funding, but at this point submitting pull requests is more valuable to us!
Edit: Forgot to mention that you can usually find us on IRC on freenode at  stop in and ask us any questions you might have. 
Edit 2: Thanks to a great suggestion from we are going to be creating incentives for development through the Tip4Commit platform, where users receive 1% of the total bounty for their commits. 
Our goal to start is getting a 1.0BTC bounty. The link to donate is here: tip4commit.com/projects/728
Thanks for everyone's help!

Is it safe to keep it in a single paper wallet? No. Fire or theft means you should have another paper wallet at a separate location. 
I also recommend a different medium for backup as well. While you're creating the paper wallet, save it as an image and put it on an unused flash drive. That way if the paper is damaged, you have a digital copy available. 
Forgetting the password is your greatest threat, next to losing the keys physically. Have a backup at another location.

As I understand it, OT isn't fully decentralized, leaving points of control. That doesn't mean it isn't awesome and won't be widely used, but OpenBazaar couldn't be shut down at all.
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:01:39


This is done by the market. OpenBazaar will have a web of trust for reputations, and individuals will choose based on ratings and such, the platform doesn't assign arbiters. How this system is bootstrapped is a good question, but I suspect there are plenty of folks like yourself who will step in and get a valid marketplace going.


It varies widely. Python, C++, Go, they're all over the place. I think Python is a good starting point though.

The quality of drugs from the Silk Road were higher than street drugs (according to academic studies) meaning fewer overdoses. Also there were no turf wars online.
It's almost certainly the case that the Silk Road reduced violence overall. Prohibition causes violence and poor quality, dangerous drugs.

We're happy to have any help, though OpenBazaar is meant for Bitcoin. 
But since it's open source, alt coin folks can help develop the platform then fork it when it's compete and modify it for their coin.

We aren't setting up a marketplace. We are creating a platform that let's anyone create their own marketplace in a decentralized network. 
We aren't charging for use and don't have plans to make money on this, though we're open to it as long as it doesn't put any barriers in the way of folks using the network. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 15:47:16
@_date: 2014-08-31 16:04:45
Please be patient with us, we're working like mad right now to get it out today, but it will be closer to the end of the day than the beginning. And as points out, it's a platform for testing and doesn't have many of the features that will eventually be implemented.
I will release a beta testers tutorial later today that should help people get started.
Edit: Beta is launched, check it out:

It has been used to facilitate a handful of real life trades so far. I've bought honey from a beekeeper in Ohio, and a Tarot card reading. I know one Australian artisan sold his handcrafted pens (at least one of them!).
But it's not really ready for trade yet, it's still for testing. I think Spring 2015 we'll have it were regular folks can use it.
@_date: 2014-09-01 15:18:05
It's something we want to incorporate, so bear with us. There aren't many testnet obelisk servers so we'd have to run those too.
@_date: 2014-12-26 20:21:33
That's not true, but it's also not my point. 
I meant the question you asked originally about decentralization. Lots of responses here to your question, but you have chosen to argue with everyone instead of listen. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 01:36:26
I would argue that rings and flowers are substantially different, with flowers being a proof of burn and a ring being closer to a timelock or surety bond.

Getting a node running isn't a piece of cake yet, but it's not terribly hard. You can check out the tutorial [here]( 
What I thought you were asking was building a different client on top of the network other than the default client that we're making.
I honestly don't know the answer yet, but in theory you should be able to build on top of it no problem. You just need to be able to generate, sign, and verify Ricardian contracts, generate, sign, and broadcast multisig transactions, and connect to the network.

As an OB dev, I'll just add one thing: We don't want the community to get OpenBazaar fatigue. We have a subreddit at with a growing community and we encourage people to consider posting over there instead of always posting here. 
As much as we love the support, we don't want to wear out the welcome.

Science and policy-making are entirely different. You can agree on the science and completely disagree with the policies being proposed. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 19:53:20
I would reiterate this point. Your audience will place more trust in you when you highlight pros and cons.
Cons include a steep learning curve, difficulty of keeping keys safe, volatility, uncertain legal status, and lack of widespread adoption.

It's not like this is a problem unique to our system, all online commerce has to deal with this. It won't work 100% of the time but that's an unrealistic expectation, it only has to be as good (or hopefully better) than existing platforms.
Norms will emerge over time of how to prove which party is acting in good faith. It's hard to predict those beforehand but we already know about some, tracking numbers, photos, etc.

That type of stuff is a ways down the road, probably after the full client release. So at least 5 or 6 months I'm guess, and it may be longer or not even happen. Don't know.

1. This has no connection with OB at all
2. The idea for decentralised marketplaces have been around for decades (cypherpunk mailing list). Neither you or us can take credit for it.
3. We do not use an altcoin for contracts, we just use Bitcoin. 
4. **OB is open source.** 
Open source is important to mention as well.

We're trying to get it right, but we need the community's help to deliver on our promises. 
We need Beta testers, starting in just a few days. We need patience, our team is dedicated but not large, and only part-time. And most importantly we need people to use the platform once it's out of Beta, get those network effects building.
If you're a developer or know someone who is, send them along to our Github, we could use the help! 
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:48:32
openbazaar.org is still being developed, but it could be a great Ebay or Bitmit replacement. 
Completely decentralized, so there are no fees apart from paying an arbiter if there's a dispute.

Putting the Bitcoin point aside for a second...
Just pointing out that since OP asked *can*, and not *may*, the answer to nearly every possible question would be yes.
People under 18 *can* own alcohol, drugs, guns, and do just about everything people over 18 can do. But they *may* not, depending on who makes the rules.
I feel this distinction will become more and more important as technology makes *may* much less important than *can*.

 Is the history of Bitcoin political? 
I argue it is, and offer three pieces of evidence.
 1. Satoshi was political.
From the Bitcoin wiki on Satoshi's motives:






















So Bitcoin's creator was clearly political, unless you think "we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years" is a neutral statement.
 2. Bitcoin's intellectual foundations were the cypherpunks.
Even if you disregard the motives of Satoshi, you cannot ignore the intellectual tradition that Bitcoin is based on, or the earliest testers and adopters of Bitcoin. People like David Chaum, Adam Back, Wei-Dai and Hal Finney were all cypherpunks, and all were either cited by Satoshi or used Bitcoin in the early days. And if you don't think the cypherpunks are political, then you haven't researched their writings at all.
 3. The first widespread use of Bitcoin was subversive.
Perhaps the ideological origins of Bitcoin aren't enough to sway you. Let's look at the first widespread use of Bitcoin in the real world: The Silk Road.
It was an underground drug marketplace with an extremely ideological leader and community that held book readings and generally believed they were opening up a new era of free trade. It was about as anti-government as you can get, both in ideology *but also in action*. No taxes paid, laws openly flaunted, etc.

Just a reminder that exists, it's got users who are interested in OpenBazaar specifically and not Bitcoin broadly so posts like this might be better received.
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:25:49
While I don't think anything is set in stone, we do want to have a unique name that will return good search results, and I think so far OpenBazaar has served us well. As others have mentioned, bazaar is also a word that is used internationally, and we feel strongly that the concept of free trade online isn't only valuable to English-speaking countries.
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:19:24
+1 for the OpenBazaar reference. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 00:08:56
A potential solution is surety bonds, which we hope to include optionally in OpenBazaar but only after we get the arbitration system going.
OpenBazaar uses a marketplace for arbitration. Each node in the network can be a buyer, a seller, or an arbiter (actually it can be any of them).
It uses Ricardian contracts, so that a seller offers up his original contract with product details by pushing it to the network and having it stored in DHTs. A buyer takes the contract, adds a proposal for an arbiter, and digitally signs it, then sends it back. If the seller agrees to the arbiter, they sign it and send it to the arbiter The arbiter then create a multisig for all parties, and if the seller sends the goods and the buyer is happy then you have 2 of 3 parties signing and the funds are released.
This sounds complicated but it's all back-end, the user wouldn't see any of this.
BitWasp is neat and I've been following it for awhile. The benefit of OpenBazaar over BitWasp is a tool for contract generation and validation, a network to share those contracts, and a marketplace for arbiters, with reputations and ratings.

I'm not a developer myself, but that seems unlikely. We rely on a lot of python libraries for various things, and I doubt all the functionality could be entirely switched over to JS. It's also not as secure, though I think DarkWallet is showing that it can be done.
It's open source so we welcome anyone giving it a shot!

We're going to change how prices work in the future. Haven't talked about using bits specifically, but it's something we'll consider.
@_date: 2014-09-05 03:40:47
We're focused on getting the 2 of 3 multisig with a third party running smoothly first. We expect the vast majority of users will not be comfortable jumping from existing ecommerce platforms to mutually assured destruction transactions, it's just too jarring. Having a reliable third party is our first step, then we'll add more features.
@_date: 2014-08-28 18:52:16
In just a few days we'll have more details on that. I'm writing up a tutorial right now.

Hey folks, Sam Patterson from the project here. 
This is a good article by Angel, and I think it many on the team feel the same way.
To those who don't feel like this is a project worth their time, that's cool. We're explaining why we find the project valuable, but we don't expect everyone will.
I'm also hearing a lot of folks criticize involvement in the project because of possible reputation hit if the network is used in distasteful ways. That's obviously a possibility (though we are trying to mitigate it), but I see this point of view as very stifling of new innovation.
Any new technological innovation, from cameras to computers, can be used in socially destructive ways, and people have always been eager to highlight - and exaggerate - how the new technology can be harmful.
It was said that electricity [would allow]( predators to see when lights are on, leaving women and children vulnerable. The VCR was [compared]( to the Boston Strangler. Video games will create a violent new generation of teenage killers. The internet was going to unleash a wave of abductions and who-knows-what-else.
These reactions are so frequent they've been given a nickname: techno-panics. You can read more about them [here](
It goes without saying that OpenBazaar isn't in the same league as electricity or the internet, but already we're seeing a small scale techno-panic around the concept of decentralized markets.
We're not so foolish to think that nobody will misuse the power to trade directly with others online. I also know that people misuse bitcoin, and the internet, and all technology. Very few would argue that the fact a technology can be abused means it shouldn't exist at all. 
And of course the argument that bad things can happen doesn't even consider the good things that can happen, which I believe are staggering if we develop a truly free market online that is accessible to the world.
My belief is that in the future, looking back at the debate over the formation of decentralized markets it will be strange to even comprehend. Of course people should be able to sell things to each other directly! It's as fundamental a human interaction as anything else we do.
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:56:17
You are correct from the technical perspective that the decentralized marketplace we are building will be superior to older markets.
But I want to be clear that we are *not* building a "Super-Silk-Road," which caters to a certain subset of the population for illicit purposes. We are thinking much broader than that, we want to make online trade peer to peer and have average people all over the world engage in it for anything they want. Open up markets in a way the world hasn't seen yet.
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:35:08
It uses two of three multisig. Buyer, seller, and a third party that buyer and seller agree to.

Too late. Are you not familiar with the history of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-09-01 05:15:13
Right now, the notary is the only third party, and anyone can be a notary. Eventually we've have arbiters, who's whole job will be dispute resolution, and notaries will handle the signing of contracts and creation of multisig.
What stops someone from becoming both seller, or buyer, and arbiter? A web-of-trust we've creating that will see people creating their own networks and not connect them to the rest of the network. It's pretty complicated stuff, but you can read about it [here](
Also, ratings and reputations, just like other platforms.

A similar idea is giving users the option to only view products from users with a larger reputation pledge, thus only displaying merchants who are likely to be legitimate.
@_date: 2014-09-01 04:13:33
There's no sign up. Once you download the program, you are in a network of peers running the same program. Think of it like Bittorrent, except for sharing information about products instead of other files.

Reputation and the WoT should prevent this, once the system is functioning. Until then (for beta), we'll have a "Block User" option so that you won't see their listings any more.
Also, we're looking at creating search result whitelists as a plugin that individuals or organizations curate. They are optional to join.
@_date: 2014-12-20 01:32:22
In theory a platform like OpenBazaar could support this. GPS coordinates can be included in any of the ricardian contracts, and it can use the same WoT and reputation network. 
It's not anywhere near ready for this, but perhaps one day. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:30:58
Great to see.
I work on OpenBazaar but what the community needs are lots of different attempts to make decentralized trade happen. And hopefully for those different projects to collaborate. Best of luck.
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:49:11
We won't have Tor integrated early in the beta. But it will come along in later releases (a few months from now). The full release will have Tor.

OpenBazaar is a network of users that want to buy and sell stuff directly with each other.
They download a program onto their computers, and that lets them upload their items to the network or search other items.
You use Bitcoin to pay, and there are no mandatory fees. For sellers, the lack of fees and built in user base are probably the biggest benefits.
It's in beta now, so you might want to wait a few months if you want a stable platform with lots of users.
Come to to learn more.

I think you can send a changetip to a specific address, but I'm on mobile and can't send you a link on how to do that. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 18:35:38
Actually the OB platform doesn't hold coins, it just facilitates trade among parties. As such, it doesn't need a bitlicense. 
Also, the language clearly states that consumers and merchants that only use Bitcoin to buy and sell goods and services don't need a bitlicense. 
In my day job I'm a tech policy analyst, and I'm fairly confident I've got this correct :).

Don't keep paper wallets in a jar underground. It's not so simple to keep items (particularly paper) from being undamaged outside. Moisture will almost certainly damage the paper unless you really know what you're doing.
BIP38 is great, just don't forget your password (right it down somewhere else). Buy a cheap fire safe ($30 at Wal-Mart) and put in your paper wallet and a PDF of your paper wallet on a USB drive. And have a backup off-site (trusted family member, or safe deposit box).

Bitcoin is programmable money. That means that in the insurance industry, Bitcoin could be incredibly useful by using some of the more advanced features that only a digital currency can offer.
Imagine a 2 of 3 multisig transaction with three users, the customer, the insurance company, and an arbiter. The customer regularly pays into the fund, and in the case of an accident the insurance company agrees to sign a transactions sending back all (or some portion) of the funds to the customer. If there's disagreement as to a claim, the arbiter makes the decision. No need to bring bank accounts into the picture, and the accounting is done on the blockchain itself.
This could be done now, but in theory there are many future applications in the insurance industry. You could use the information from the sensors in the vehicle to determine if the user was at fault in an accident, and how extensive the damage is, and automatically disperse funds to the local car repair shop for repairs or to the customer if the vehicle is totaled. In fact, you could also automatically pay a tow truck operator to visit the site of the crash instantly.
Being able to program money means you can tie payments along with any other data you want.

It surprised me to see the large numbers as well. I thought it would be lots of small amounts.

Yes. You can already do this, and it's already being done. It's just not public yet, and the platform isn't ready for trade anyway, so there isn't too much to look at (about 30-40 test stores).
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:23:53
Sure, understanding Bitcoin in depth will be valuable. Also, begin contributing to open source projects so you get a feel for it. Learn Git and GitHub, and a language that is widely used (such as Python) by such projects.

Multisig has a long way to go in terms of usability. I'm working on the OpenBazaar project and it's not easy to implement them yet.

Wow. This thing blew up.
@_date: 2014-08-27 05:36:41
I think this is a great idea, but requires a third party service that doesn't currently exist.
If someone creates this system and it's being used, I have no doubt we'd let this be an option for OpenBazaar users. If anyone wants to work on this, reach out to us and let us know.
@_date: 2014-08-27 06:12:32
This is an interesting idea, and we're looking at timelock, but it's not really there quite yet. If anyone has implemented a system like this (or if anyone really wants to build it), we'd love to know about it.


If PoB were the only component to the reputation system, I'd agree, but this is just one piece (and the first one we've rolled out). 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:18:56

Thanks for the input. We have a good group of devs who are donating their time. You should check out the github again, and try running it. We've made great progress since the fork, look through the code again and give us your feedback.

Production-ready is a stretch. Our bar for production ready means that normal ecommerce users could switch over easily. NXT isn't there. Perhaps by production-ready you mean it can be used for trade at all?
OpenBazaar has been used for real-life trade since August, so I'm not sure how NXT FreeMarket can claim to be the first.
Honestly, it's silly anyways. No one is using either platform for any serious amount of trade yet. They simply aren't ready. Our metric for success should be how many thousands or millions of people use decentralized markets instead of centralized ones. We're still extremely early here.
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:18:22
That is something worth keeping in mind, but we definitely prefer to have devs who are passionate about the vision of OpenBazaar so that they stick around. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:11:54
Well said. I've done several interviews for the project now, and I find it disheartening that so much of the focus is on the illicit substances angle.
Not to sound full of ourselves, but together with Bitcoin and other projects we are allowing people to cut out all the intermediaries that cost individuals so much money, time, and control over their own trade. The potential gains to society are substantial; ecommerce isn't forced to be an endless sea of servers that need energy and maintenance, but something run primarily on a peer to peer infrastructure that already exists. No one controls this network and anyone, anywhere, can sell anything for any price and at any time, *for free*.
But that has taken the back seat to the latest juicy story about this darknet market or that one. Hopefully that changes once the platform is ready for widespread use.

To clarify, the Reputation Pledges (proof of burn) are not the only component of the reputation system. We will have a web of trust and rating system as well, this is simply the first part to be rolled out.
This will not prevent the "long con," it's more to give users some assurance that they are more likely to be dealing with a legitimate dealer, which is especially useful before the rest of the reputation system is built.
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:14:40
Seeing stories like this, and the 800BTC guy, I just wish they'd let me take care of their bitcoin for them. I'd only ask a small fee. I might even do it free, because the thought of bitcoin vanishing or going to criminals makes me sick.

Sam Patterson here.
I talked quite a bit with Andy for this article, and overall he did a good job representing my position.
I would quibble a bit with him quoting me selectively from this [forum post]( If you read my entire post in context, I think it re-enforces my statements. But he does provide the link, and it's no big deal.
Since the drug issue is one that comes up a lot when talking about OpenBazaar, let me steal from my Twitter to try to summarize [my views]( succinctly.
**Avoiding drug prohibition doesn't drive OpenBazaar, but we won't apologize for creating a truly free market online.**

This is an interesting idea, but I'd like to see it actually happening in the wild to determine if people are willing to do this.
Also, it's not trustless. You are trusting the other party significantly. If they walk away, or get into a car wreck, or lose their key, you're screwed, especially as the buyer.
It's tempting to try and eliminate all third parties, so I hope something like this works. But before it's been shown to work, we're taking a different path for OpenBazaar. We have a 2-of-3 multisig between buyer, seller, and an agreed-to third party (informed by a reputation system). 
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:34:10
Only time will tell. We think we'll have the first full release (usable by average folks) sometime in Spring 2015. Obviously to replace existing markets it would take many months after that for people to switch, if they found it to be valuable.
@_date: 2014-09-21 21:24:16
We haven't gotten to the optimization stage yet, so there's been little effort to make things fast. But it's something we know is important, and will be addressing. We have a team member who is knowledgeable about search across BitTorrent networks and already has many ideas on how to speed things up, it's just a matter of priorities at this point.

If you want to know the project's stance on anonymity, read through the entire thread you linked in your post. We value it and will be protecting it. Tor isn't integrated in early beta, but it's coming.

Someone might be able to do this once, but only if the buyer was foolish enough to do a transaction with both a merchant and arbiter who had no reputation. As soon as they do it, they will get a negative reputation and can't do it again, so this is mitigated by the web of trust reputation model. Buyers should only use arbiters with a good reputation.
That begs the question about bootstrapping: how does any arbiter or merchant get a good reputation to begin with? We're working to ensure they can link their existing BitRated, BitcoinTalk, Ebay, or other profiles to their OpenBazaar profile in a secure way (likely posting a signed message).
Additionally, we have a way to mitigate this entirely down the road: instead of a single arbiter, the third key in the multisig is actually a voting pool of arbiters or even of peers. That way it's practically impossible to collude.


We want this to happen, and think it could work. What we want to create is essentially a magnet link for commerce. Anyone can have a website and store front with their products just like they do now, except instead of checking out with their shopping cart on the site they click the contract link and it opens up the OpenBazaar client, where they finish the transaction.

Yes. We're still going through the process of determining when we are trying to tackle new features, but as of right now it looks like we are aiming to have auctions implemented in Beta 4.0, end of November.
Edit: Coincidentally this came up just now in a dev conversation, and it might actually be later than Beta 4.0, it's a very difficult technical challenge for a decentralized platform.
@_date: 2014-09-19 06:18:20
Yeah we absolutely love to hear new ideas about how OpenBazaar could be used, but right now it's not something we can really act on until we've got a rock solid foundation in place. 
If there's no stable network and user base, all these exciting ideas can't come to fruition.
@_date: 2014-09-20 17:45:17
Gotcha. We're working hard to get it to that point. Wait until Beta 4.0 in November, some really great changes will be completed then.
@_date: 2014-10-18 22:08:02
Yes, one of the team members is putting together a Windows build now. got it running on his Windows machine, that's his screenshot. The goal is to have it completed by beta 3.0, by the end of the month. They're aiming for one click install, but no promises!

It's not all or nothing. If you have a lot of Bitcoin, some of it should be in cold storage for security and some hot storage so it can be used.
This isn't complicated. You can divide Bitcoin into as many wallets as you want.

It's already out, technically.

Open Bazaar is decentralized just like Bitcoin or bittorrent. Each node is an individual computer, it can't be shut down unless they ban computers or the internet.

Well said.
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:49:35
We're working on that. It's not quite ready to be used end to end so not many people will want to use it, but at the end of the month it should be relatively simple to get a node running and join the network. In the meantime, if you're on Linux, check out this link:

Please Reddit user for one day with a (literally) incredible story, tell me lots more very shocking things!
@_date: 2014-08-24 20:23:48


Setting up multisig requires no technical know-how at all. The client automatically creates it from the public keys of buyer, seller, and notary. The buyer then sends funds to the multisig.
Releasing funds means clicking a button. For the merchant, you hit "contract fulfilled" once they've shipped product or otherwise fulfilled the contract. For the buyer, they hit "Release funds to merchant" once they received the product.
That's it.
If there's a dispute it uses the same simple system. Client handles it all.

Author of the article here. We're excited to let people test out the platform and get their feedback, though this project has only been in progress since late April there have been a lot of people who have put a lot of time into it.
But, it's still early, and the platform is still very young. Please read through the beta tutorial thoroughly before jumping in, because it's not a simple task quite yet.
If it's over your head right now, please check back for the beta 2.0 that we'll be releasing in a month, or the beta 3.0 in two months. Eventually you'll be able to test it out, I promise.
I'm happy to help people get it running too, or answer questions. Check out the IRC room on Freenode at

I'm a team member on the OpenBazaar project, so I can give you some information.
OpenBazaar is a decentralized platform for online trade with Bitcoin. Each user is their own node, and connects to a network of other nodes that list their products or services. No one controls the network and there is no central point of failure.
From BitWasp's information I can't tell if they are decentralized or not, it doesn't appear so but I'm not sure.
OpenBazaar is a fork of the Dark Market, and is actively being developed. You can check out the activity on our [Github]( and also a busy IRC room at  on Freenode.
BitWasp's most recent commits are three weeks old, I don't know how actively they are developing currently.
I also don't know their timeline for a stable release. We are aiming for an August beta, and a full release at the end of the year.
If you've got specific questions, let me know.

Anyone can become the third party, so there's a market, and prices will be whatever people agree to.
My guess is early on, for small stuff, it'll be something like a minimum flat fee (a few dollars) or 1%, something like that. But I really don't know. Perhaps some third parties offer free services for small amounts to bolster reputation first and subsidize their larger trades.

That's the goal. We only at the first beta, and aren't looking to have average folks use it now. We clearly state this in the [beta tutorial]( It's not anywhere close to ready for mainstream.

Hey everyone, author of the article here. Let me address a few common things I'm seeing in the comments.
First of all, this isn't the only aspect of the reputation system for OpenBazaar. Users will be able to have ratings and reputations similar to other platforms. This is just the first portion we've completed and rolled out.
Also, the reputation pledges are optional right now. If the other aspects of the reputation system work well enough, they might not be widely used, but we want to give users the option (especially for bootstrapping) and see what the market decides.


Yes, this isn't different than using bitcoin in any other way. Practice good coin hygiene.


Unfortunately that introduces a point of failure into the system. OpenBazaar dev Dionysis Zindros has written about this in his [excellent paper]( on the trust system he is building:






Another sentiment:




Yes, and we're looking at timelock and other things, but this is the best so far. 
Also, it's not quite so bad as people think in terms of lost coins. When a coin is burned, it increases the value of all existing coins, so apart from the cost to the user making the pledge, value isn't being lost, just transferred to everyone else.
We love hearing new ideas from the community, so if you feel like you could improve on what we've got, please send us an email at project
**Edit:** [explained]( my last point better than I can, so I'm repeating it here:














@_date: 2014-10-27 04:17:35

With the Web of Trust model it will segregate users who only have trust among themselves. Since they aren't receiving trust from anyone outside their own network, they don't make connections to other users, and their fake reputation won't be able to deceive anyone.
This is a similar model to what  uses:

Essentially all online commerce today is done over centralized platforms, such as eBay or Amazon. Buyers and sellers connect to servers owned by those companies to manage their trade. They charge fees and control the trade on their platforms.
OpenBazaar is an attempt to create a decentralized platform for online trade. Buyers and sellers download and run a piece of software on their computers which allows them to connect to other users, and engage directly in trade. There is no server, company, or middleman in between them. It uses bitcoin.
This is a video I made showing the platform a couple months ago:
We're in beta 3.0 now, hopefully have a full release Spring 2015.

It just is a warning that on the network, your IP is tied to the actions that you take with your node. Tor isn't integrated so we want people to recognize their IP is visible (even if it's changing).

It's the final goal for society, but not for individuals. Because I cannot know what your preferred ends are, and I know you can't know my ends, the only arrangement that makes sense is for us is to agree to a system that allows everyone to pursue their ends as long as they don't use force to achieve them.

Your criticism is only towards one portion of OpenBazaar, the networking structure. 
OpenBazaar is also a system that allows for the creation, signing, and verification of Ricardian contracts, which create an immutable record of trade. It also creates a 2 of 3 multisignature system (using HD keys), allowing one party to facilitate trade and take a percentage for dispute resolution, if needed. If no dispute resolution is needed, then the trade occurs directly without fees. It also uses a novel system called "reputation pledges" which allow a user to burn Bitcoin tied to their store identity, thus bootstrapping trust in a pseudonymous manner.
I believe those other aspects of the project are valuable to the Bitcoin ecosystem, regardless of the networking structure. If the networking structure doesn't work, then it will be changed. The project is not finished.
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:51:51
"I got scammed for thousands of dollars because I trusted advice from strangers on Reddit and you're all responsible!"
Why are people on here sympathetic to this? If the subreddit had a link to a reputable prince with a legitimate business opportunity would you spend thousands of dollars on it?

@_date: 2014-08-21 19:44:39
You can encourage that with proof-of-burn for identities. Even if the identity is anonymous, they can burn a certain amount of coins to show that the cost of abandoning this identity is high and therefore they are likely to not scam you. However, this is vulnerable to the "long con."
It does also help prevent sybil attacks in a decentralized system.

Surety bonds. Yes, we're taking about that, but for now rely on arbiters.

Considering that $1 billion is about one-fifth of the entire value of all bitcoins, here's a similar question:
What if someone wanted to buy $2 trillion worth of gold at once?
Demand would far, far outstrip supply, so it depends on how quickly they would want to buy. In theory if they want it quickly enough they could pay as much as they want per bitcoin / oz. of gold to create an incentive that almost no-one would reject, such at $1 million per bitcoin / oz. of gold.
More likely, they'd buy it more slowly and see the price increase gradually. If this was done over a decade, it wouldn't create a to-the-moon increase, it likely wouldn't be noticed at all (assuming others buy as well). If done over 6 days, to-the-moon we would go.

Yes we're working on it. We knew not having Windows would be limiting but since we had a lot of other bugs to work out we figured that it's alright to not have too many users out the gate. Considering the overwhelming amount of feedback we've already gotten I think that's the right choice, but we will open it up to Windows users as soon as we can.
@_date: 2014-08-29 00:28:34
That's a surety bond, and we want to implement that as well, but it requires a third party service that doesn't exist at the moment. We are all about giving users options to control their own trade, so as soon as stuff like this is viable, we'll do our best to incorporate it.

Please be patient with us, we're working like mad right now to get it out today, but it will be closer to the end of the day than the beginning. And as points out, it's a platform for testing and doesn't have many of the features that will eventually be implemented.
I will release a beta testers tutorial later today that should help people get started.
Edit: **BETA IS LAUNCHED!** And it's before midnight, hurray. Check out the thread and tutorial here:

Yes, you would put in a fixed amount of dollar value and the amount of Bitcoin you purchase would vary each time. If you buy, say, $25 worth of Bitcoin every two weeks, you'll get 0.103 now, but maybe 0.11 or 0.097 two weeks from now.

Yes, you are missing something. There is a third party. It uses 2 of 3 multisignature between buyer, seller, and a third party.
It's one of the core features. If you're interested, this is an introductory piece to read:

I'm seeing 30+ individual nodes on the network right now, looks like a good half of them have products, mostly for testing but there are a few selling real stuff already.
So much fun to see new nodes join and hear people's feedback :).

I don't know if you're for real, but damn. Hopefully you're an early adopter and had some squirreled away elsewhere?
@_date: 2014-09-19 06:20:49
We did release one a while ago, but it's not been developed further and doesn't really work, there is a separate effort now for an installer and it should be ready before too terribly long.

Dollar cost average. Set up recurring buys for small amounts every time you get a paycheck. This way you accumulate bitcoin regardless of price changes. Ignore the price.

Lots of good points all around, but people seem to be taking this transition too seriously. The transition will be an experiment, if it confuses people too badly then anyone who switched will have an incentive to change back. If it works great, then others have an incentive to switch. 
It's not going to destroy Bitcoin, nor will it usher in the golden age of Bitcoin.

I appreciate the sentiment, but the only thing that will speed up development is more developers. In theory we could hire people but that requires a whole different level of funding. If you check out the develop and release branches on the github you'll see that we are already moving at a swift pace. The project is only 6 months old! 
@_date: 2014-09-01 00:57:41
For now it'll be pulling from Github. We'll have a .deb soon, and a windows installer for a later beta version.
For Linux and OSX users, run these commands:
    git clone 
    cd OpenBazaar
    ./configure.sh
After running the configure.sh script you should have an OpenBazaar installation ready to go, to start run:
    ./run.sh
Then point your web browser to

You can choose the third party that creates the multisig and is a party with a key along with buyer and seller. If there's a dispute, the parties have to take it up with the notary, a person who has a reputation and is being paid for dispute resolution. 
I'm sure it won't be perfect, but at least in this system you get to choose your third party and it's not some huge unknown department at a company.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:48:40
Hey, OpenBazaar dev here.
To be clear, while we appreciate donations and will put them to good use, we don't *need* donations right now. Other projects may falter without funding, but OpenBazaar has always been a project run completely by volunteers giving their own spare time. This means that if you don't choose to donate, we'll still keep putting out code for the foreseeable future.
Now, we will use the funds for things like setting up more seed servers, or Obelisk servers, or other necessary costs to help the network function. We'll also use them to pay for conference registrations (as we did with Coins in the Kingdom) and other non-technical costs.
We don't have a detailed breakdown of what our costs and needs are yet, since we aren't asking for funding from anyone. So far, we've received something like 17 bitcoins, and we've only spent a small portion of that.
We'll have an announcement soon about the donation side of things, since this project is so important to the Bitcoin community we want to take extra steps to make sure we're approaching this correctly. Stay tuned.
*Edit*: The extra steps I mentioned earlier are moving the funds to a multisig fund, and committing ourselves to transparency. Read more about it here:
*Edit 2:* If you'd like to keep up to date and chat about OpenBazaar specific topics, join us in @_date: 2014-11-07 17:50:31

Since no one answered the question directly:
The source code is on Github and you can get it running right now on Mac or Linux, with some trial and error. It's beta 1.0, and at the end of the month 2.0 will come out, and so on for each month until the full release.
Instructions are here:
However, the full release, which will make things easier and won't have stability issues or major bugs, should be released at the end of the year.
@_date: 2014-09-01 04:35:23
Everyone in the network is a node. Buyers, sellers, notaries, everyone.
Eventually I'm sure we'll see "gateway nodes" that let you access the network without a node, just like bitcoin clients don't all need the blockchain today. But that's not here yet :).
@_date: 2014-08-28 17:29:51
You're exactly who we're looking for in beta, someone to offer up small items and test out the platform. Let us know what works and what doesn't work, so we can keep on improving it until it's ready for mainstream.
We launch on the 31st, though I'm guessing it'll still be plenty buggy, and we release new beta versions each month.
@_date: 2014-12-26 19:41:20
Tell that to Russians right now. Fiat money has a very poor track record historically. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 05:31:24
I get what you're saying, but since it's so early we're alright with having a small number of users right off the bat. If we're able to find out the main problems with a smaller group of Linux and OSX users, and then open up a more stable platform to a larger audience of Windows users later, that's not such a bad thing.
The deadlines are self imposed to being with, we just didn't want to be one of these projects that takes years and years before they ever even get customer feedback. That's our line of thinking anyways.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:49:34
Eric Voorhees is human after all.
I'm disappointed in you, and other prominent members of the community, but we all make mistakes. Assuming Bitcoin has a long life - and I still think it will - we'll look back on this as a wake-up call to adhere to the principle that launched Bitcoin. Having a *trustless* digital currency means you don't trust third parties.
Don't lose heart, you're one of the better public figures for Bitcoin out there, and we'll probably need you now more than ever.

We don't provide escrow, individuals do. This is distributed, we only create the code and deploy some seed servers, but this is decentralized just like bittorrent or Bitcoin.

If you're trying to sell to the Bitcoin community specifically you can try using OpenBazaar, which only accepts Bitcoin.

Yes. Our goal with OpenBazaar is to allow users to manage their own trade however they want, so we'll include as many options as we can. But we'll only work on implementing new ideas once we've got the existing features working well, so it will be way down the road.
Also, as someone else pointed out, please feel free to post OpenBazaar specific questions in @_date: 2017-02-08 23:55:26
The 2.0 version being built has Tor implemented now. I've used it. We still need to have a security audit performed, and there's more work to be done on 2.0 altogether, but it's coming along nicely.

The hosting platform middleman has pretty much always charged a higher fee than the fiat exchange fee middleman, so claiming "lowest possible fees" seems a stretch to me.
Also, they say elsewhere:


Fees aren't the only drawback with middlemen. Censorship and unappealing terms and conditions are a problem as well. It's misleading to say this:


When they actually are planning on "curating" their inventory for them.

Thanks for your reasonable response. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:36:32
Thanks for the thoughts. We've addressed  some of your issues, such as port forwarding (we now use UPnP and STUN) and the program is much, much more stable. However, search is still in its infancy, and we recognize its importance. 
We're aiming for late spring for getting out of beta, so I hope in a few months you'll try again. We're getting there slowly.

I work on OpenBazaar, so I'm biased, but people are focusing on the illicit trade nature of Silk Road in these answers when your question wasn't about that. 
Can OpenBazaar be a way to use Bitcoin that will help drive adoption? I don't know, no one does, but the idea of having a truly free market online is a powerful one. Free in two ways: trade isn't directly controlled by anyone, and it costs nothing to use. 
It's a lot like how bitcoin itself is giving users direct control over their own money. It's powerful, but it doesn't change the entire financial system overnight, nor does it come without bumps in the road. I'm certain that giving users direct control over their online trade will follow a similar path.

Please note that is, in fact, only comprised of individuals, and cannot have a monolithic or coherent view of anything.

Lighthouse allows for creating assurance contracts with Bitcoin. This means a payment is conditional, until the exact amount is raised then no one has actually paid. You can reverse your own commitment at any moment up until the full amount is raised. 
Additionally, the platform is decentralized, and free to use. 
This is very different from simply having a donation address.
Yes, there's no central location to browse projects, but that aspect is trivial compared to the creation of the platform itself.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:25:01
I meant at the time I thought that. It rose too quickly, I thought it was a bubble.
Perhaps I was right! Again, I have no idea about what the "correct" price of Bitcoin is, neither does anyone else. There's no such thing, it's a market and as such cannot be predicted.

Yes sir, I'm the operations lead on the project. Development was a bit slow over the holidays but 4.0 is coming out at the end of the month, and we're presenting at FOSDEM as well.
OB uses localhost too, it's actually a similar system to ZeroNet in some ways (ZMQ, UPnP, web app, etc).
@_date: 2014-10-19 01:39:47
This is going to happen. In fact, it already is happening, the first API and OpenBazaar browser are already built and you can easily view everything on the network just by visiting a website (the site isn't public yet).
This makes it optionally decentralized. Users who care about decentralization will run their own nodes, users who don't care will connect to a third party service online.
To be clear, apart from running the seed nodes, the OpenBazaar team itself won't be running nodes like this - our goal is to put out the code, not directly facilitate the trade.
@_date: 2016-03-05 19:12:30
Bitcoin began Jan 2009.
OpenBazaar began April 2014.
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:42:33
This is the type of user we'd love to enable with OpenBazaar. They can directly put their products on a decentralized marketplace, and there's no one in between them and the buyer, no fees to pay.
We'll need volunteers to help translate the client into other languages, but apart from that as long as the user has access to the internet they can participate in global trade with Bitcoin.

Yes I know Bitmarkets has this implemented. I like Bitmarkets and Steve, but it's not actually being used for trade. Has 2-of-2 been used for commerce anywhere?
My skepticism isn't about the technical underpinning of the idea, but about its acceptance by users. 2-of-3 mimics a fairly typical escrow setup that has been used for ages.

No specific timeline. If everything goes perfectly in testing it could be very soon, and if there are horrendous bugs we didn't anticipate it could be months away still, but I expect something in the middle.
To be clear, it can run on the main net now. This is just being cautious to make sure people don't lose money or mess up real trading until it's proven out in the wild.

OpenBazar wasn't designed based on the needs of contraband vendors, so it's possible you're right.
Moderators will use tracking numbers on packages and other information to settle disputes. Don't forget that this isn't a single organization offering escrow - there's no exit scam possibility here - it's a marketplace of individual moderators to choose from.

I'm one of the people running the project. How exactly do you envision OpenBazaar would be shut down? It's software everyone individually can run. No central point of control; that's the whole point.
Also, what would law enforcement come after us for? Writing code? That's speech protected by the first amendment. All we're doing is writing open source code. We're agnostic as to how that code is used. It's a tool, just like TCP/IP is a tool.

This comment implies that peer to peer trade is only useful for illicit items. I disagree.
There is an enormous amount of trade being done online right now, and nearly all of it uses centralized services like Amazon or eBay. These platforms provide a place to connect buyers and sellers, and offer other services as well, and in return they take a percentage cut of each transaction, typically anywhere from 5-20% depending on the good or service. They also collect data about you, and because they control their own platforms entirely they can censor trade as well.
OpenBazaar offers an alternative. People now have a tool to easily engage in trade directly with other people. This eliminates the cut from the middleman and gives people options to secure services (such as dispute resolution) on an open marketplace. Traffic is encrypted so your own data and trade is more private. Censorship of trade can't happen at the network level; the only way to take a store offline would be to physically go into someone's home and shut off their computer.
If you haven't tested out OpenBazaar yet, [give it a shot]( It's a completely different experience from trying to set up web server, install ecommerce software, install Bitcoin plugins, etc. It's open source and free to use.
@_date: 2016-03-30 19:54:15

Congrats to Purse for this new service.
[This language]( on this site puzzles me though (disclaimer: I work on OpenBazaar and am totally biased towards decentralized markets):






But the lowest possible fee is 0%, not the 1-5% cut they are taking.
And they themselves *are* a middleman. They take a cut, and they control what is allowed to be sold.
In fact I believe they are the sole escrow holder, there's no marketplace for escrow.
There's no problem charging lower fees than the competition, and being a better middleman than the competition, but that language seems to imply they're something that they aren't.

But it's possible to not use payment processors at all, or have middlemen at all. You mean "lowest possible fees while still using middlemen." And it appears that fees vary from 1-5%, depending on a vendor's willingness to pay an additional monthly fee.


But....Purse isn't eliminating middlemen. It is becoming one itself. You can claim it's better, and that's perfectly fine, but it's not the same as the claim to "Eliminate the Middleman."
Can Purse censor content on the marketplace? If yes, then what does it mean to say "Sell your products direct to shoppers and take control over your inventory."


I have no doubt Purse is doing a good job here. I do disagree with your statement that allowing an open marketplace for escrow will necessarily lead to a worse experience for users. Free markets with low barriers to entry have historically led to better outcomes than centralized markets with high barriers to entry. Locking escrow into a monopoly is what leads to a worse experience for users, in the long run.

OpenBazaar is decentralized and no matter how many times I've corrected you, you continue to spread this lie.
Let's try to get a definition of decentralization first, and then see if OpenBazaar fits.
Here's a pretty [good attempt]( at doing so from the Institute for Software Research from UC Irvine:














Ok let's break this down.


There is no single centralized authority that makes decisions on OpenBazaar.


OpenBazaar is composed of peers which makes their own decisions, who directly interact with others and share information or provide services to other peers.


Entry of peers is not regulation on OpenBazaar and any peer can enter or leave the system at any time.
I could go one but it's pretty clear that according to any reasonable definition the OpenBazaar network is decentralized. Your persistence in repeating this "OB isn't decentralized" claim shows you are intentionally misleading people.

My point in mentioning that is to counter his claim that disparages Bitcoin because drug dealers use it and it's anonymous; implying it's this perfect currency for the underworld.
Except law enforcement clearly can catch people using Bitcoin for illegal activity, per the most famous example of the Silk Road (and other markets that have been busted).
(I don't buy the argument that Bitcoin is bad because it facilitates black market activity anyway, but I'm responding to his arguments on his terms mostly.)

Historically money has needed to serve three purposes: 
1. Store of value 
1. Medium of exchange
1. Unit of account
That thread you linked is arguing heavily in favor of Bitcoin's value being derived from it being a store of value. Whereas Fred Wilson and others seem to believe that it's primary value will come from it being a medium of exchange, via success of markets like OpenBazaar.
I don't pretend to know the answer here; I suspect it'll be a mix of things that gives Bitcoin its value.

I work on OpenBazaar.
The project has always been based on Bitcoin and we have no plans to change that. 


My opinion: I think you're exaggerating the problems Bitcoin currently faces. Bitcoin is still functioning and fees aren't so high as to inhibit the vast majority of transactions.
Maybe at some point in the future the fees would prevent you from buying small items, but this doesn't mean Bitcoin wouldn't work with OpenBazaar, it just means that smaller items aren't as likely to be sold on the platform. 
The average ecommerce order today is something like $50-$80. On OpenBazaar the cut taken is 0% instead of the typical 10-15%. That difference alone dwarfs Bitcoin fees.
However, if fees did begin to rise substantially then we'll look at the same solutions that everyone else in the Bitcoin ecosystem will be looking at - things like the Lightning Network.
I still believe in Bitcoin as an excellent online payment method and see no reason why OpenBazaar won't continue to use Bitcoin indefinitely.
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:44:55


Even at this point in development, privacy on OpenBazaar is substantially better than Amazon or eBay. Those platforms require identifying yourself, and/or using payment methods that require identification.
On OpenBazaar, the primary privacy concern is that the IP address of the user isn't obfuscated. This is certainly a concern if you have a nation-state as an adversary, but less problematic for the vast majority of the users.
This is very similar to Bitcoin itself. A Bitcoin address isn't tied to identity, just like an OpenBazaar store ID isn't tied to an identity.
This isn't to say that we don't value privacy or security; we do and we will continue to work on improving them. This is only to push back on the claim that the existing centralized institutions offer similar privacy.

This is inaccurate.
OpenBazaar is not a centralized marketplace like eBay. They own the servers themselves and control them 100%, and they take a cut of each transaction. They can censor any trade on the platform they like.
OpenBazaar has no central point of control. No one owns it; it's a fully p2p network like Bittorrent. Each individual store controls and hosts their own data (and can use a VPN if they choose). There is no cut taken on each transaction because there is no middleman in the trade at all; it happens directly between the parties involved using Bitcoin.
It wasn't coded specifically not to allow Tor use. We chose UDP for the networking benefits, not because it prevented Tor. We're looking at alternatives like i2p now, which uses UDP. There was an [article]( yesterday about this.

OpenBazaar is not an organization. It's a name for the application, protocol, and network itself. Just like Bitcoin.

You realize that you also can't access the blockchain directly from your browser either?
So a blockchain based market like Drop Zone and a p2p market like OpenBazaar both need a third party service to view the markets directly via HTTP.

The OpenBazaar client does have the ability for people to list their own products as NSFW, and then when users start it for the first time they are presented with the option to "Display NSFW content?" and choose for themselves.
The problem with that is that people can mislabel their listings and host an inappropriate image or listing without labeling it NSFW. We only have one solution for that at the moment. You can block other stores and you'll never see their listings again (this does nothing at the network level; just locally).
Naturally people like to be trolls and do this intentionally (we're already seeing it on the testnet) but we anticipate on a darknet it would be even worse.

 Pivoted"
Chris likes to claim that we "pivoted" away from DarkMarket, which was solely focused on illicit goods. However, we've said from the beginning that our focus was much broader and we felt that peer to peer trade would be valuable for all goods. DarkMarket had too narrow a vision.
If you don't believe this, check out the [article]( Wired wrote in August of 2014, literally titled "Creators of New Fed-Proof Bitcoin Marketplace Swear It’s Not for Drugs." Here's a quote:






If you have a computer and an internet connection, you can engage in trade with anyone else in the world at no cost and with no reliance on any middlemen. Just download and launch an application and you can participate in global trade. I view that as useful to more than just people selling contraband.
 is Not Decentralized"
Joshua has [repeatedly]( [claimed]( [that]( OpenBazaar is not decentralized, despite me pointing out his error constantly.
OpenBazaar is a decentralized, peer to peer network. There is no central authority that controls the network. Amazon and eBay and pretty much all online markets have a central authority; OpenBazaar doesn't. I'll quote myself from an [earlier post]( to clearly define what decentralized means.


























 is just a worse version of HTTP"
As I said in [this post](










And [here](












 is trivially censorable"
They think the best approach for building a marketplace is to put all the data into the blockchain because it makes it highly censorship-resistant, and they place a strong emphasis on that. 
But there are all kinds of drawbacks to doing that, and we choose a different architecture. We take an approach much more similar to the Bittorrent network. It doesn't use a blockchain for hosting data, but instead it hosts the data on individual nodes. Each user on the network hosts its own content. This means that if the store goes down, other users cannot reach it (like a node on any other peer to peer network). We have talked about making store data redundant, and might try to use something like IPFS so that other stores can cache data in the future.
Censorship cannot be done at the network level. There's no "marketplace administrator" that can take down stores like on centralized marketplaces, whether clearnet like eBay or Darknet like Silk Road. There's also no ability to censor a store based on the DNS system. Censorship would need to be someone else going to each person's home and unplugging their computers.
Since most people are engaging in commerce that puts them at no threat of having someone bust down their door and shut down their computer, this isn't such a huge problem. Besides; what's the point of having that information duplicate somewhere else if you're unable to operate your store since you're in jail? 
Users who do care about privacy can already run OpenBazaar behind a VPN they trust. This would prevent others from seeing your IP and then the ability to censor becomes way more difficult.
If the only person who can really censor you is a nation-state level actor - and they can only censor you by physically shutting down your computer - then I consider that censorship-resistant.
 is just a Shitty Shopify / Magneto / web-hosted store"
I hear this one a lot but it's [silly](
































There's two huge differences that they ignore. 
1) It's not at all simple to go through the process of buying a domain and hosting, then setting up the site and integrating Magneto or whatever. OpenBazaar is free, and it's just download and run the file, that's it. Super easy.
2) OpenBazaar instantly connects you to everyone else using it - buyers and sellers. Also, with a self-hosted site you usually accept the coins directly or rely on a payment processor; OpenBazaar gives you an open marketplace for trusted third parties to join in 2-of-3 multisig for trusted escrow.

Despite what the other guys are saying, no one on OpenBazaar "allows" anything. The network is completely decentralized; everyone runs the software on their own computer (or on a VPS) and there's no central authority that controls the listings.
Now, it's not being built specifically for contraband, so there's no IP address obfuscation (Tor or I2P). If you list something illegal then the government could subpoena your ISP, come to your house and arrest you and shut down you computer. Your computer hosts your store so if you're arrested your store is gone (though if you're arrested it hardly matters, does it?).
Just like with the Bittorrent network, users may use VPNs to enhance their privacy. But we aren't trying to build another Silk Road, that was never our intent.
These two love to say exaggerated or flatly false things about OpenBazaar, it's been going on for months. We weren't sure why until they announced they were working on Drop Zone.

Bitcoin's current PoW works just fine, and there is already a huge amount of hashing power keeping the network going.

Yes. The listings themselves are very flexible and can include location data as granular as GPS coordinates or as broad as city, region, or country.
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:03:39


Our system uses the Ricardian contract model to create contracts that are electronically signed by all parties involved. Everything you need to continue the trade, or settle a dispute, is included in the contract, and because it's signed it's an immutable record of trade.
HTTP doesn't do this. 
Also, there will be services to interact with the network via HTTP, just like there are services to interact with the blockchain via HTTP.


Sure you can, though not many do because it's a pain in the ass. OpenBazaar makes it much easier than self-hosting a website, and it also has an open marketplace of third parties built into the system so that you can engage in secure escrow with 2-of-3 multisig.


There are different types of users on the network. Buyers, who make up the majority of users, can "just get on with an internet connection."
Vendors do need to have a constant connection in order for others to view their stores; this is how peer to peer networks work. We are looking at options for stores to be cached by other nodes using a system such as IPFS.
If a user doesn't have a reliable connection they can pay for a VPS to host their server. The cost of paying for a VPS is substantially lower than the fees they pay on major ecommerce platforms after only selling a handful of items.


Did you even read what I wrote? I said they provide services. The problem is they are bundled and the user is forced to accept all or none. OpenBazaar unbundles the services and opens them up to competition.


It's not all or nothing. Let's say for example a vendor saves 15% because there are no Amazon fees. He might be paying 5% of that savings in services (dispute resolution or product discovery), take 5% as profit and pass on 5% to his customers. 
You lack imagination. You've been spewing this stuff for months and months on end.

At the network-wide level, it can't be taken down other than someone going to everyone's house and shutting down their computers. It's a decentralized network like Bittorrent and can't really be shut down since there's no central point of failure.
At the individual store level, it could be taken down by shutting down the computer that is hosting it. As others point out, we're looking at ways to allow the data to persist on other nodes, so even then shutting down a store wouldn't remove the data.

Amazon is a centralized platform that bundles a bunch of services together and then takes a 15% cut of the transaction as payment. You pay for dispute resolution, product discovery, store hosting, reputation, and other services by paying 15%, even if you don't use them all.
OpenBazaar is a decentralized platform that doesn't force users to purchase any particular services, and there is no central entity to take any % cut of the transaction as payment. Users can choose to purchase services on an open marketplace with competition instead of being stuck with one provider.
There are pros and cons to each of these approaches, and no one working on OpenBazaar would claim that all trade online will immediately shift over to the decentralized model. 
However, we do believe that OpenBazaar will allow for cheaper online trade. It does this by creating a standard protocol for trade between the parties involved, creating a network for sharing information to facilitate the trade, and introducing competition to the services that were previously offered by a single party. There's no middleman anymore, but the same services that the middleman offered can now be purchased on an open marketplace.
It also uses Bitcoin, so there's no identity theft problems or chargebacks, and it allows for secure escrow using 2-of-3 multisig.
The platform is free and open source. Only barriers to entry are a computer and an internet connection.
This is the explanation for people who understand about decentralization and Bitcoin. I can't predict exactly which part of this will be most appealing to mainstream users, but I expect for mainstream sellers it's "**OpenBazaar is free, has no fees, and you control your own store**" and for mainstream buyers it's "**OpenBazaar has discounts on products and I don't need to turn over my personal data to a company to use it**."

A good question. Here are a few reasons. 
1) Our system uses the Ricardian contract model to create contracts that are electronically signed by all parties involved. Everything you need to continue the trade, or settle a dispute, is included in the contract, and because it's signed it's an immutable record of trade. HTTP doesn't do this.
2) It's not at all simple (or cheap) to go through the process of buying a domain and hosting, then setting up the site and integrating Magento or whatever. OpenBazaar is free, and it's just download and run the file, that's it. Super easy.
3) OpenBazaar instantly connects you to everyone else using it - buyers, sellers, and third party escrow agents called moderators. With a self-hosted site you usually accept the coins directly or rely on a payment processor; OpenBazaar gives you an open marketplace for trusted third parties to join in 2-of-3 multisig for trusted escrow.

"Banned outright" is probably too strong, you're right. But I recall reading some conversations years ago about how to prevent 51% attacks and some folks suggested that a 51% attack should be fairly obvious and as an emergency measure you could use the concept of higher priority coins to make it obvious their chain - even though it has the most work - is an invalid chain.
I'll need to look around to find that. It's not in the code now, but we've seen as a community that we can respond to emergencies fairly quickly. The specter of a 51% attack doesn't bother me too much.

The Bitcoin block reward (the amount of Bitcoin a miner receives when they find a block) is going to be cut in half from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC sometime later this year. This happens automatically in the code.
This is the second time this has happened. The original block reward was 50 BTC.
People speculate that this will increase the price because it reduces supply. In theory, since this event is already known well in advance, the supply drop should already be priced in and it shouldn't affect the price too much. But no one knows for sure.

This is completely wrong.
Haven does use IPFS. You are running a full OpenBazaar node on your phone when you use Haven. You are _not_ just connecting to a central server.

It is out of the question because the rate of sending the information is slower than a full block.
You can do it for single transactions but then the answer to the question "I always wondered if Bitcoin could function without the Internet in an event of a doomsday blackout" is no.

It's true that making a p2p app on mobile is difficult, but it's possible. Haven is the OpenBazaar mobile app, and you only run it when you need to use it, so it doesn't take too many resources.

Right, that's the difference between HF and VHF / UHF / other higher frequencies. Commercial use of spectrum exists at the higher end, so you have neat products like that. But there's no commercial allocation (or extremely little) at HF frequencies, so all the gear and antennas are for military or amateur radio operators. Typically expensive and not all that simple to use.
Some of it is just physical limitations though. You can't really have an HF antenna in a convenient form factor like the GoTenna. The antenna length needed to create radio waves that will skip off the ionosphere is way too long to be easy to use.

The third parties, who hold the third key in a 2-of-3 multisig, will be able to charge fees at any percentage they like. However, it's an open marketplace for these moderators, so competition should keep the rates low as you suggested.

This is neat and we should focus more on radio to prevent internet censorship.
But this isn't actually Bitcoin sent over radio. The information needed for Bitcoin to be sent / received was in the radio message, and then the internet was used for the actual transaction.
We are _very_ far away from being able to run Bitcoin over the radio, especially over long-range radio (HF) because it simply cannot transmit the data fast enough. At higher frequencies it can, but the range is much more limited.
There are other practical limitations as well. This was two licensed amateur radio operators with HF radios and antennas, which is costly, requires space for antennas and knowledge on how to operate them (as well as licenses if you care about obeying the law). It's not possible to run the Bitcoin network with this setup (legally or technically).
Having mesh networking at a city-wide level is actually possible right now, and would provide some censorship resistance against internet attacks. That would be a better starting point than HF if anyone were serious about Bitcoin over radio.

You can view the network here:
It's true there is no centralized company running OpenBazaar that offers customer service. But buyers and sellers typically choose to use escrow, requiring a third party, who can offer service if something goes wrong.
There are over 20k listings on the network right now and a mobile app was released a few months ago which now has over 50k installations:

OB1 was founded years before BCH even existed. It is absolutely not a BCH company, whatever that means.

FM radio is not HF and has very limited distance. The data rate of HF is way lower than higher frequencies like FM radio.
This thread is about long-distance radio, the image shows 14Mhz.
You can watch Nick Szabo and Elaine Ou give a presentation talking about this at a Scaling Bitcoin conference a couple years ago. Full blocks cannot be sent over HF. If you care I'll find a link.

OpenBazaar took no position on S2X, as it's simply an open source codebase and p2p network like Bitcoin. If someone told you "Bitcoin took X position" that wouldn't make any sense either.

Soft forks aren't a panacea. If you have an overwhelming amount of support in the community for a hard fork then it's not nearly as dangerous as some claim.
If Core had led the effort on a hard fork for a block size increase, I'm absolutely certain it wouldn't have been contentious, and we wouldn't even be in this situation. They made a decision to do Segwit via soft fork, and that failed. The Segwit2x compromise was reached and Segwit activated, but now a hard fork for a larger block size is the other part of the deal.

Segwit is great; I'm for it. IMO dealing with transaction malleability and allowing second layer solutions is the biggest value added from Segwit - the ability to reduce congestion is dependent on how quickly and widely Segwit is actually implemented, meaning there are no guarantees that is actually does much of anything to help with congestion at all (at least for the immediate future).
Which isn't true with a blocksize increase. That's instant.

@_date: 2017-08-11 00:45:41
Segwit itself will do very little to relieve congestion. Second layer solutions will, but they simply aren't production ready and may not be for a long time. 
I don't like the three month timeline to a hard fork either, but it's not as if people haven't been thinking about how to do a hard fork for a blocksize increase for years now. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 17:15:59
You can access OpenBazaar via the web, but you'd be relying on a third party to do that. 
It's like the choice between running a bitcoin wallet yourself or using a web wallet. Both have their uses, but for the purposes of censorship resistance and not trusting third parties, running it yourself is important. 
Note that OpenBazaar 2.0 is being built on IPFS, and this will allow it to be more HTTP accessible than before. IPFS has HTTP gateways built in, and also they are working on IPFS-JS, a version which might allow OpenBazaar to be built entirely in the browser eventually. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:16:15
Expecting 100% is completely unrealistic. If Core lead the way on a blocksize increase along with Segwit there's absolutely no question that the overwhelming majority of the community would have welcomed it with open arms.
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:23:33
I understand what Segwit is and I support it. I also support a larger blocksize via a hard fork. 
I've been involved with Bitcoin nearly five years now and I know that a substantial (perhaps majority) proportion of users want both Segwit and a larger blocksize, and they don't believe a hard fork is as devastating as Core leadership seems to think it is.

It depends on how much you're buying. If it's anything serious, I would recommend a hardware wallet such as a Trezor. That will make sure the private keys aren't stored on an internet connected device and it also lets you create a seed backup (string of words) that you can use to backup your wallet and restore it if you need to. I highly recommend Trezor but there are also ones like KeepKey and Ledger as well. You can buy them on OpenBazaar or other platforms.

I'm excited about those technologies, but the fact of the matter is we have no idea how long it'll take for them to make it to market, and while we're waiting for that to happen the Bitcoin network is almost certain to become more congested and have higher fees.
Segwit2x recognizes the value of segwit and the opportunities it unlocks, but it also recognizes that it's vital to have a usable network for people to spend their digital cash.
If we get fees that are too high then Bitcoin is severely inhibited in it's original mission: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. I'd rather have a system that works for its intended purpose but doesn't have all the best engineering instead of a system that promises all the bells and whistles at some point in the future but in the meantime fails to deliver on its original use case.

I've been involved in the block size debate since it started getting heated ~ three years ago. I'm familiar with the arguments. 
Everyone involved with Bitcoin when I got started in late 2012 knew that we would need a block size increase eventually and it wasn't contentious. It was just "we'll do it when we need to do it." There was a whole list of neat things we could do when the hard fork happened.
Then instead Core took forever to release Segwit, and as a soft fork, and only with overwhelming miner support, which inevitably failed.
All of that is forgivable if they just admitted they messed up and took the compromise path of Segwit and a larger block size. I'd love to see them leading the way on this, it's a shame they're being left behind.

This is ridiculous. There's no reason to question the motivations of any of these people or organizations. They all have different visions about what Bitcoin is, or what makes it successful. They aren't all bad people with bad motivations.

That's not true. There are lots of people who saw the compromise position of Segwit and larger blocks as being the best path forward. 


Love and hate are strong terms, but there are lots of people who believe in Segwit but also think we need larger blocks, now. Overall I think Core has done a good job, with the one glaring exception of refusing to increase the block size. That exception (along with the subsequent +$3 fees we now have) are enough for me to support 2x.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:43:16


It's the "rushed" part most people would disagree with. Yes, btc1 itself is being done quickly, but this debate has lasted years and Core has been given enormous leeway to properly do a block size increase, which they've just refused to do it at every opportunity.
Now we see the results of their refusal: fees over $3 a transaction and Bitcoin being unusable for its original purpose, p2p electronic cash.
I don't want to fire Core, but I really _really_ don't want Bitcoin to be unusable and that's where we've been heading for years. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:37:37


It's not anonymous. Pseudonymous at best, and by analyzing the blockchain a determined attacker could likely identify you.

@_date: 2016-12-27 19:32:26


That would also defeat the purpose as well. Cash has value for whoever holds it, and *only* for whoever holds it.


A better point, because it's electronics and could be damaged. But to be fair, paper wallets or really any backup or storage method can be damaged too.


If the point is transferring ownership of Bitcoin physically there still needs to be a way to talk to the blockchain to prove ownership initially. This is where the cash analogy breaks down because you can visibly inspect cash to see if it's legit. You can't look at the USB stick to verify authenticity, but you can plug it into a computer. And nowadays that isn't such a high barrier.
I own OpenDimes but admit I haven't used them yet. I like the tech but so far don't see much of a compelling use case for it.
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:41:16
We've known for years that problematic network congestion was only for matter of time unless we had second layer solutions implemented or a hard fork with a bigger blocksize. 
And now we don't have second layer solutions or a bigger blocksize, and guess what: we have problematic network congestion. 
Segwit was a great start but it failed to activate. A hard fork without Segwit was unappealing to most. So there was a compromise position: Segwit2x. It gave us Segwit for future second layer solutions and a blocksize increase to alleviate network congestion immediately. 
Most miners and the economic community liked the idea of breaking the stalemate and preventing Bitcoin from being completely unusable as peer to peer electronic cash.

This is solved by using escrow via multisig.

This relies on the idea that there are only two positions; big blockers and Core. Therefore if big blockers got their big blocks with Bitcoin Cash, there's no need for 2x.
That's false. Every user, miner, business, developer, everyone has different ideas about scaling and the core values of Bitcoin. Some people are 100% in the larger block camp, and some people are 100% in the never scale on-chain camp, but the vast majority of people are a mix.
Bitcoin Cash is run by a few people in the 100% larger block camp. They don't have that many miners or people who want it. It's not a viable option for people who want Segwit and want the leadership of good engineers, but also recognize that being locked into a 1mb blocksize is a bad idea.
I don't want Bitcoin Cash, I want Segwit and a bigger blocksize. Segwit2x is a better choice than Bitcoin Cash and it's a better choice than staying at 1mb indefinitely.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:49:06


The debate over the necessity of a hard fork for a blocksize increase is now several years long. Let's not pretend that opponents of segwit2x are sitting on the fence waiting for yet another article explaining why being locked into a 1mb blocksize is a bad idea. 
The information is out there, most people have decided, and their positions are irreconcilable.
I strongly support both segwit and a larger blocksize. If the core developers feel strongly that 1mb is the right number and they're willing to stay there even with the majority of the economic community advocating for a larger blocksize, then a fork is inevitable.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:02:14
I don't understand the decision that 1mb is the proper blocksize either. It wasn't arrived at originally by any scientific process (that I'm aware of).
The opposition to using a hard fork I *do* understand. But when such a huge proportion of the community is clamoring for a hard fork, and it's needed to prevent the very real threat (reality?) of transaction congestion / high fees, then it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do. I wish the core team had done it months and months ago.

It's possible that the uses are all based on private, in person trades, and by the nature of those trades people don't take to public forums to talk about them.

I worked in DC at a non-profit for years and my degree is in political science. You're naive about how politics works.
Technology gives people more freedom and control over their own lives than politicians ever will. Bitcoin is infinitely better than asking the Federal Reserve to stop quantitative easing. Encryption is better than asking the NSA to stop illegal surveillance. Online black markets are better than asking permission from the DEA to let us control what goes into our own bodies.

I work on OpenBazaar. It runs on IPFS which allows nodes to go on and offline and still be able to engage in trade, but LN more or less assumes an always-on network to be able to receive funds or engage in multisig, which meant LN adoption poses problems for the OB trade flow.
However it's still something we're investigating and several people on the team thing an integration *is* possible. Work hasn't begun but we're not "bona fide resistant" it's just a difficult technical challenge because of the way OB and LN work.

Yes, it's true that in some scenarios you could hold Bitcoin in a way that would make it technically impossible for them to confiscate, but most people don't hold them in that way, and most people wouldn't let their lives be ruined in order to keep holding them in that way.

Close. I was the recipient of the Bitcoin, the one who sent the ACK. Both he and I do have those special licenses, we're both amateur radio operators.
You're correct that this is shortwave, although people often use that term to refer to listening and not transmitting, and the amateur bands are only a subset of the shortwave band. Most amateur radio operators (also called hams) call it HF (high frequency).
So two licensed amateur radio operators exchanged the plaintext details of a brainwallet using a protocol called JS8 on HF. The private key wasn't sent. The FCC is prickly about anything encrypted being sent on the amateur bands. The private key isn't technically encrypted data, but sending the plaintext details needed to sweep the brainwallet was safer.
It's also not secure at all, and not a viable way to transfer Bitcoin. It's just for fun. If an HF system for BTC was ever designed it wouldn't look like this.
If anyone is curious, the rig I used to receive the details and transmit the ACK is an Icom IC-7300 with a 55' high multiband homebrew dipole antenna. He used 40 watts, I used 25 watts. Something like a -9d SNR both ways.

I've been a Bitcoiner and a ham radio operator for a long time and it's great to see them interact. This example is really just for fun and not a viable way to send BTC, but I believe such a system could be devised.
Radio has great promise in ensuring censorship-resistant communications, and Bitcoiners should all consider learning more about it.
If anyone has any questions I'm happy to answer them.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:12:14
Where did you hear that? OpenBazaar is built on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:11:34


Just *exited* beta. Full release went live yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:10:56


I've been supportive of SegWit and I'd love to see other services adopt it, but it's not as though I have much of a say on this matter. And as you say, it's not a long term solution anyway.


There's no question this could be improved, it's something many services struggle with because it's difficult to do properly. However, I can confidently say that this is only part of the problem, because I deal with complaints constantly about people's transactions not confirming. Telling people who paid a $2 fee that it'll take an unknown amount of time for their Bitcoin to confirm isn't a pleasant task, and very frustrating for them.


Great, I support it. I don't think it's ready yet, is it?


Again, I'm not sure why you'd think me calling anyone out would make a difference here.


The debate has been going more than a couple years already, but I know you and I won't agree on this point so I'll digress.


This is probably what you should lead with. I don't want Bitcoin to become unusable for ecommerce and believe we need to abandon the artificially low block weight limit. You are comfortable with fees getting to the point where ecommerce isn't viable anymore. That's fine, it's two different visions.
A common theme I see in your line of thinking is very, *very* long time horizons when viewing Bitcoin. I would normally applaud this; short-term thinking is often catastrophic. But in this case I think it ignores that fact that this long-term bias is causing you to neglect the very thing that made Bitcoin valuable in the first place, and neglecting the core value proposition seems dangerous to me. If we see another coin become the standard for ecommerce instead of Bitcoin, I question whether the "digital gold" value proposition can survive long enough to see all these great new (theoretical!) innovations reach maturity.

Not legally. The FCC doesn't allow encrypted communication over the ham bands (except in some rare circumstances).
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:41:52
Both, there are a few pre-set but you can add them manually also. It's very easy to do.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:14:11
Several orders of magnitude is absolutely accurate. Look at the numbers yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:43:43
Don't feel too bad. That was about when I bought in and I spent most of those coins years ago. Buying and holding 5 years is unlikely to happen for most people.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:57:26
If you want to add more listings you can scrape and pull them from the OpenBazaar network. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 21:12:09
This is an open source project. If you want something specific to happen, submit a pull request or fork it and do your own thing.
As others point out, using Onename is optional.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:51:14
We went through all this less than a week ago. You're either a paid shill or a fanatic who's been [caught spamming]( about this for months, and had at least one of your sockpuppets banned by the subreddit moderators recently.
Anyone interested in the truth can read through that thread, I'm not going to respond to your lies every single time.
**Edit**: Or at least they would have been able to go through that thread if you didn't delete your previous posts to hide your activity.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:46:06
OpenBazaar only uses Bitcoin at the moment, what do you mean bcash?
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:50:35


Right, and every single time a government agency starts regulating an industry they only stick to their original professed scope?
These agencies exist to justify their own existence (and budgets). They absolutely cannot be trusted to keep themselves in check. The FCC is notorious for censorship of the airwaves, you think they'll just act totally opposite their own established history because... they promise?
We didn't need net neutrality through regulation before and we don't need it now.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:51:16
That link doesn't say that, because it's not true. There is no "they" when it comes to OpenBazaar, it's just a software project. The wallet is a typical SPV wallet with the option to use a full node if you want. OpenBazaar users will be able to decide for themselves what they want to support.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:33:48
I don't control their opinions nor the ways they express them.
Ideally people judge projects by the code and how useful the product is, not their opinion of the people involved. If you haven't tried OpenBazaar 2.0 give it a go.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:18:14
You'll notice that on the link you provided, there's no mention of OpenBazaar at all.
That's because OpenBazaar doesn't support 2x, and in fact isn't capable of supporting anything. It's not an organization or a company, it's just an open source code base. Exactly like Bitcoin is.
If you want a decentralized marketplace for your decentralized money, then use OpenBazaar. If you want to stick to the centralized ecommerce systems that monitor your data, censor your trade, and take 10-20% of your money each transaction, then don't use OpenBazaar. Cryptopolitics shouldn't come into play here.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:47:52
It's not an argument by authority. It's commenting that if you believe that all the people you once respected have changed, consider that perhaps they haven't changed and you have.
Or to put it more bluntly, "If everywhere you go it smells like shit, maybe it's time to check your own shoes."
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:24:20


Hate to burst your bubble but GPU mining Bitcoin doesn't help in any way at all. It's a complete waste of electricity and time. 
This is a mathematical fact you can choose to accept or ignore.
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:02:50
Sam from OpenBazaar and OB1 here.
First off, it's great to see passionate people paying attention to the project, and also putting forward a real argument. This is the type of community discussion we want to see.
There are a few points I can make about your comments.
Most importantly, **using OneName is completely optional**. Your screenshot doesn't show the [entire modal]( which allows people to skip the option of registering. Everyone is free to check out the [prototype UI here]( (note it's a demo and only works in Chrome, eventually it'll be a standalone Electron app).


We want OpenBazaar to be accessible to anyone with internet and a computer, so it needs to be easy to install and run. Downloading a blockchain isn't an option for average users. Not having a SPV implementation right now isn't good enough; we're building the platform right now and we need a way to allow users to create a simple handle if they want to. OneName seemed like the best choice.
This is an open source project, and anyone is free to submit pull requests and open issues on Github to get a conversation started about the code and alternatives, but we need something usable in hand as soon as possible.
One last point. **OpenBazaar offers its users the ability to place as much emphasis on decentralization as they want**. We use Obelisk servers in the code, but if a user wanted they could run their own. You can run your own node locally, or you can use a VPS. You can hook into OneName or you can keep your network ID. *[Edit Note that you can use this in a decentralized way by using their open source [resolvers]( We're aiming to make this flexible enough to satisfy both hardcore decentralization buffs and also regular folks who run an Etsy store. Whether or not we've struck the right balance is something the community must decide, but we welcome the conversation.
**Edit:** Muneeb from OneName has [given his thoughts]( below.
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:24:07
Everyone please note that this isn't the new UI. It's an older prototype. You can check out the new UI demo here: 
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:38:50
No, typically in startups you don't have higher salaries, you have lower ones but they get equity in the company. That way if the company becomes a success, they will earn a lot more from equity than from salary.
Again, it's high risk high reward. Most startups don't make it big and equity isn't very valuable then. But of course if you work for the company you try your hardest to succeed and make your equity worth a lot. Aligns incentives.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:56:12
Same. It's true too.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:09:23
OpenBazaar already uses Segwit by default, I just said that. That's the only thing I have control over. 
LN isn't ready for adoption.
I'm telling you that, today, there are thousands of people who want to use Bitcoin for ecommerce and are being priced out due to fees. Expecting all those people to just stick with Bitcoin for an unknown period of time while we *might* get lower fees due to Segwit or we *might* get LN working is unrealistic.
I want Bitcoin to be a good medium of exchange and a good store of value, but right now it's quickly losing value as a medium of exchange and that bothers me.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:56:22
Except I'm being provided many services by government which I don't want, and even if I want them I'd prefer them to be provided on a market instead of having a monopoly.
For example, I'm provided the service of invading foreign countries and then forced to pay for it. I'd rather this service not be provided at all, and I certainly don't want to pay for it as well.
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:09:03
Unfair? I don't understand what you mean. You've pointed out why we give people the option to use OneName, it's more convenient than having to use the long string of characters.
We can't do the same thing within OpenBazaar itself, because it's a DHT and not a blockchain. So we're optionally allowing users to use a third party service to get the convenient handle.
I don't understand your objection. Do you have an alternative that doesn't require our users to download an entire blockchain?
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:32:00
Also _test your backups_.
I can only imagine how many people think they have long term holdings only to discover they forgot a password or the ink on the paper wallet faded or who knows what else. Have backups and test them (without exposing the keys to an internet-connected device).
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:14:23


That's a ridiculous thing to believe. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:10:49
We're trying to make the UI awesome right off the bat. Here's a prototype (still buggy, needs to be viewed in Chrome):
You can just click through the initial setup.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:54:26
We received $1 million. It's what we needed to get the right team and make the first full release awesome and completed fairly quickly.
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:32:46
OpenBazaar is a decentralized marketplace that allows users to buy and sell goods and services directly with each other, using Bitcoin.
It works by downloading software which connects you directly to others using the same software (a peer to peer network). You put listings on a searchable network, and others buy it with Bitcoin. There are no middlemen, thus no fees or censorship.
The system optionally allows users to engage in a 2-of-3 multisig transaction with a trusted third party called a moderator to resolve disputes if they arise.
The current code is rough, but usable. It's only for testing at the moment. The first version aims to be released in November. You can see how the basic client functioned in the original code [here]( The new release will be completely different.
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:42:41
The reference client is a desktop build, no mobile yet. That's coming eventually.
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:05:18
We're only a team of six. It wasn't difficult to get people who were already working on OpenBazaar to go full time. We are fortunate that we have well known VCs providing the funding, which also helps.
This is a tech startup. It's not for people who want stable jobs. We all know it's high risk and high reward.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:42:07
You're welcome, thanks for the discussion.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:37:30


You have your chronology confused. Bitcoin has historically been an excellent medium of exchange. I've been using it for five years and up until about a year ago I never had any problems. It's only recently become a better store of value. These changes need to be viewed on a longer timescale than the past year.


You're seriously suggesting that, even though the project I'm a part of uses SegWit, that I shouldn't complain about high fees unless I've helped SegWit integration in all other wallets? That seems like an absurd statement. SegWit was a soft fork so that no one *had* to upgrade. It's absolutely not my responsibility to get everyone else to update.


I've been advocating for people to hold their own keys for years now, so if they're using custodial platforms then they don't control their own Bitcoin and that's bad. I advise people to use hardware wallets mostly.


That's great, but we're not only trying to build a platform for people to "play with" but for people to use for real ecommerce. Which they've been doing, but is stunted by high fees. Right now adopting coins other than Bitcoin that are usable for ecommerce is the only thing we have in our own control that can help this problem.
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:06:48
The release **won't** be anything like the video, because that's not the UI we're using. 
You can view a prototype (in Chrome) here:

Are you incapable of understanding the difference between a company and an open source software project?
Every time DCG-funded Blockstream makes a statement do you attribute that statement to Bitcoin itself?
OpenBazaar does not support segwit2x. That's 100% true no matter how many times you link to your own previous comments.
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:06:11
I don't remember this happening before 2015 when net neutrality wasn't enforced by the FCC. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 21:33:39
I have personal experience with this. My father passed away unexpectedly in May, and owned a few Bitcoin (my brothers and I had talked so much about it he decided to buy some).
I created some encrypted paper wallets for him, and he deposited the Bitcoin there.
When we began the process of settling the estate, the Bitcoin was - by far - the simplest thing to settle. Opened his safe, got out the paper wallet. I imported his coins into my mobile wallet by scanning the private key and putting in the password (MyCelium FTW) and then sent equal portions to all my siblings. Done in under an hour sitting around the table.
Compare that to his bank accounts. There's still been no death certificate issued (state governments suck), so we cannot do anything. When we finally do get the death certificate, I have to go through a ridiculous bureaucratic process of proving who I am to the banks and that I'm executor (which was a pain in and of itself).
Bottom line: If you have a trusted family member, just create an encrypted paper wallet (make sure to have an off-site copy!) and have them store the password. If there's no one you trust (or perhaps they are ignorant of Bitcoin altogether) then other methods mentioned might work better.
@_date: 2019-02-13 03:51:19
It wasn't encrypted at all. It was the plaintext details of a brainwallet. Not secure at all, just for fun.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:11:25


Does that ever worry you that several of the people you used to look up to in Bitcoin now fundamentally disagree with the direction it's taken?
It's possible those people went astray, but it's also possible that the direction has changed from what it was originally and they don't like the change in direction.
It just seems like labelling the ideologically driven early adopters as being "dismissive and manipulative" isn't a charitable interpretation of what's happening here. I think they honestly believe that Bitcoin has been headed down the wrong path and they're doing whatever they can to stop it (though it looks like they might be giving up on Bitcoin now).
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:32:28
This is a good point. It's not that we can't do nothing about it; you're right that there are ways to discourage illicit behavior. What we try to be clear is that we're unable to **directly censor** trade on the network. Since all ecommerce today has the capacity to censor products on their own platforms, we think it's worth mentioning how OB differs.
But we welcome more thoughts on how to prevent it from "degenerating into a cesspool". Keep in mind that OB isn't a darknet at launch, that right there should be a strong discouragement for illicit activity.
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:55:48


Those aren't my only options. Seeking to change government through their own process is pointless, but this doesn't mean I need to leave. I can accept that the current government structure isn't ideal and voice my complaints while still living here.


No. It's more like a restaurant delivering food to your door that you didn't order and then threatening violence if you don't pay for it.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:54:59
We aren't pretending otherwise. OB1 and our investors are heading into this with our eyes wide open, and being transparent about the possible negatives uses. I can't put it any better than the lead investor at Union Square Ventures, [Brad Burnham](


@_date: 2015-07-13 22:01:18


No. I'd like them to take it back, but they won't. It just sits on my doorstep, and they force me to pay for it.
Actually a more accurate analogy would be delivering food I didn't order to someone else's house, and then them forcing me to pay for it. That's another story though.
@_date: 2015-07-31 20:30:00
Awesome. Your site looks great. We'd love a professional launch video.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:48:10


We have a section right in the application thanking contributors. Here's a partial list (couldn't get it in one screenshot) of OpenBazaar contributors:
OB1 is a company and OpenBazaar is not an organization at all, just code. What part of that is unclear?
@_date: 2015-07-24 16:00:23
This whole thread is about an outdated version of the UI. The correct prototype link is here: 
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:42:48
William is known in crypto circles. He's based in Toronto and is an adviser to the Ethereum group, and he's also an angel investor in the recent funding for OB1 (the company helping build OpenBazaar; I'm a co-founder).
He's been writing and talking about decentralization longer than most Bitcoiners have been alive.
@_date: 2015-07-31 15:26:12
Yes we've talked about adding a progress bar. Could be helpful.
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:24:06
I believe that quote comes from Brian Hoffman's presentation to a Bitcoin meetup in San Diego, California, United States of America. Fairly confident they knew what he meant.
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:43:22
I actually agree. I try to get people to post this content in We try to only use for larger announcements.
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:16:38
OpenBazaar devs are working as fast as we can! Most recent [update here](
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:03:24
His statement is completely accurate. OpenBazaar is just software, not an organization or company, and it can't support anything. It was also one of the first projects to implement SegWit. Why do you say he's lying?
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:17:11
Hey everyone, Sam from OB1 here.
We're flattered that there have been a lot of OpenBazaar stories in recently. We're every bit as excited as everyone else to see this launched and have decentralized markets for our decentralized money.
However, what we *don't* want is to have the community get OB fatigue. Hearing about something all the time - but not being able to use it - means eventually you get tired or assume it's vaporware* (just two more weeks I swear!). 
So I humbly suggest - for those interested - that you begin to use for this content more regularly. It's a good sub with 3,000+ folks who are interested in OB specifically. That way if you want OB news, sub there and you've got it. If you don't, then don't sub. If you only want the major important announcements (releases and whatnot), those will likely end up here too.
Just my two cents. Carry on.
**(To be clear, OpenBazaar [isn't vaporware]( We're aiming to [release v1]( in November.)*
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:56:08
OpenBazaar is not vaporware. Here is the github repo:
You'll notice it has 1,300+ issues and pull requests, 4,000+ commits, 1,500+ stars, and many contributors. 
You can install and run it right now. 
It isn't the finished product that the bitcoin community needs yet, we know that. But there's a clear path to getting there. You can learn more at Edit: Better numbers.
@_date: 2015-07-31 13:22:00
We have a great UI/UX guy, and this isn't the finished design. I just wanted to show the progress we've made so far. There's no doubt it will be further improved to help people who aren't so familiar with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:48:38
*Regulation* implies *control*. We don't have control over the network; OpenBazaar is a protocol that allows people to directly trade with each other. We cannot prevent two computers from directly sharing information with each other over the internet via the OpenBazaar protocol.
However, we are taking steps to discourage illicit uses. One is the fact that OpenBazaar isn't a darknet; IPs are in the clear. Another is the reputation and rating system.
We anticipate that the usage of OpenBazaar will reflect society at large: most people engage in legal commerce, and a few don't. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 12:41:59
We're trying our best. Turning ideas into something real is definitely challenging, but this particular challenge is an exciting one to take on, and will be very rewarding if we succeed.
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:19:52


It won't be.

@_date: 2015-07-18 21:17:32
Like a Bitcoin address. Unwieldy, but it's worked for Bitcoin just fine so far.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:49:54
I agree with this. While I'm a huge Bitcoin fan, I'm not in the camp that believes Bitcoin is only valuable if it destroys PayPal or all remnants of fiat money, just like I don't believe that OpenBazaar will only be valuable if it destroys eBay.
These tools can co-exist with the centralized alternatives. For people that care about decentralization, privacy, and free trade, they'll now have a better alternative. For people that care about the lowest fees, they'll now have a better alternative. 
But there are many people who will be perfectly happy with the centralized platforms, and that's fine. They can have them.

There are no fees and you can use Bitcoin.

You're welcome. I can't wait to see how the marketplace develops. So exciting to imagine the possibilities.
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:13:26


This is untrue. Registration via OneName is completely optional. It's to allow users to get a short handle like  instead of a long string of characters like a Bitcoin address. It's completely voluntary.
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:18:43
OpenBazaar is being built for the Bitcoin community first and foremost. It's not a stretch to think Bitcoin users would install p2p software, and that they already have Bitcoin.


This is inaccurate. We use 2-of-3 multisig with a trusted third party (called a moderator) who will offer dispute resolution only if the vendor and consumer have a dispute.
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:53:34
I'm afraid that young folks only appear to be more tech savvy, since they're used to the interfaces presented to them. But they aren't actually any more knowledgeable about how hardware or software work than their parents.
There are exceptions, but I think ~30 year old folks are the most tech savvy age group, since they grew up with computers but also had to understand how they worked to use them.
I'm trying to make sure my kids see the guts and software first-hand (such as giving them Raspberry Pis and showing them how they work). But in real life they mostly just tap icons to launch apps on their devices. That doesn't require technical skill.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:25:24
Depending on how early you got in, it's always a good idea to cash out your original investment. If you've more than doubled, consider it. Then you're playing with "free money" from that point and can safely ignore any financial advice.
I do think we're in a BTC bubble right now. Just my two cents.
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:49:29
Eventually it became clear to my wife this wasn't a passing interest but something I chose as a career path, and she's been very supportive.
My sister-in-law also works in Bitcoin full time. Bitcoin has been good to us!
@_date: 2019-04-07 23:58:01
The Lightning Network requirement for nodes to always be online makes integration into OpenBazaar difficult, since offline transactions are possible (and a big part of the reason we built the 2.0 on IPFS).
But we're looking into it and aren't as opposed to it as some claim. Just a question of technical feasibility. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:53:58


Who are you even talking about here?
I'm part of OpenBazaar and I can say authoritatively that we didn't "want Bitcoin to remove its censorship resistance."
If you're talking about SegWit2x, it was the OB1 company which supported that, not the project itself, and removing censorship-resistance was not the goal. Remember, _SegWit wasn't getting activated_ and it was obvious that we were headed for full blocks and fees would become a huge problem, so we supported the idea of activating SegWit and increasing the block size, which seemed like a reasonable position at the time. 
It become more contentious than we expected and we pulled out, as Brian explained here:
Note that only a month or two later we _did_ experience full blocks and fees _did_ skyrocket and made most transactions on OpenBazaar infeasible, which then forced us to integrate other coins. Remember, this is way before the Lightning Network was even close to viable.
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:00:10


This is untrue. Onename registration is optional, you can just skip it.
And it's silly to say that we're "taking over the idea" considering that the OB1 team is comprised of the people who started OpenBazaar and were unpaid volunteers on the project for a year before getting funding. We got funding to be able to make the idea a reality.
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:23:00
Not second seed round, first seed round. Before this funding it was completely a volunteer project, and still mostly is - the company formed (OB1) has 6 developers working on OpenBazaar but the overall OpenBazaar community is much larger.
You can read more about this here:
Source: I'm the operations lead on the project and COO of OB1.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:57:48


Not true. That's like saying that Bitcoin addresses aren't used because they are a long string of characters. People are using this method on the OB network right now.

Thanks, but this isn't new UI! It's an old version. The new one is here: 
@_date: 2015-07-31 12:14:39
Thanks for the feedback.
Here's the tricky part about going straight to shopping: We need to give the client time  - only on the first start up - to generate all the keys needed for OpenBazaar to function. Network ID generation is intentionally made harder through a pseudo-proof-of-work in order to minimizing sybil attacks. It's around 20 seconds at this point.
So we wanted to give the user something to do in that time, and that's why the questions are done upfront.
However, we aren't completely settled on this approach, and are still making improvements. Plus, this is only for the first version; there are many features we want but will need to wait for later versions.
**Edit:** Our lead designer talked more about this [here.](

OpenBazaar will have services on the platform, but isn't completed yet. Probably November. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 17:34:25
Running it yourself means you're not relying on a third party. You store the data locally and keys locally. 
Because OpenBazaar is end to end encrypted that should result in more privacy of communications, and because your store is on your machine it makes it more censorship-resistant.
Using this service means you're trusting that third party, so it's less private, less secure and less censorship-resistant. But substantially more convenient.
It's like the difference in running a full node versus using a custodial wallet. If you care about censorship-resistance you run the full node. If you don't care, you might use the custodial wallet.
I believe the goal of Zokos is targeting people who want to easily sell something for cryptocurrency, but don't want to download and run the software themselves. They're willing to trade-off some benefits of decentralization for convenience. Up to each person to make that decision themselves.

We're not against Lightning. At the moment it isn't clear how Lightning can be integrated into OpenBazaar, because it requires always-online nodes and OpenBazaar allows for nodes to be offline and still work.
But we're looking into it and aren't opposed to it on some fundamental level, it's just a technical feasibility question.

You didn't hear about OpenBazaar in 2013 because it didn't exist until April 2014. It's only just over a year old, and it's a very ambitious project. If you want to see our timeline, visit **Edit**: A couple more quick points.
OpenBazaar is not a company. It's an open source project that started as a side project in April 2014. The code has always been publicly available on [Github]( As a volunteer project, the community released five versions. The most recent version is usable - you can buy and sell things with other users in Bitcoin - but not ready for a mainstream audience.
A few core developers started a company a [few months ago]( and received $1 million in VC funding from Andreesen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. Now we have a team of six working on the code full time, and aim to release a full version in November.
I can understand the impatience, since OpenBazaar is so badly needed by the Bitcoin community. But we're doing everything we can to make this a reality. 
This has never been a "shit company" nor has it taken four years. It's a community project that eventually led to a company, already has working code (admittedly not perfect), and will go from an idea to first full release in a year and a half.

No, we have a few ideas but haven't thought too much about the specifics. 
This can be used in a hackish way for local markets now. You can search by keyword, so if people tag their products with their city then others can find the products by searching their city.
The ricardian contract structure underlying the listings are very flexible and they could include location information as granular as GPS coordinates or as vague as country or hemisphere or planet.
If you have something specific in mind, feel free to open an issue on the Github page and make a suggestion.

The Bcoin team has been pro-segwit and only put this forward when it looked like segwit wouldn't activate. I see no reason - and no one has put forward any evidence - to think that they did this with ulterior motives.
Imagine how they feel to have all these accusations flying at them after putting out something they think is genuinely a solution to the scaling problem. They support segwit, but it stalls, so they come up with something they think achieves the same goals but might have a better chance. As soon as they announce it they are accused of being shills.
I'm sorry but this speaks volumes about anyone who is making baseless claims like this.

It's primarily search-based. It's only displaying stores that your node is locally connected to (probably a few dozen) as well as stores you've 'followed' in the past. If you're looking for new things, you'll either search for them or you'll navigate directly to a storefront.
It will also support URI linking, meaning that someone could post something like [ob: and clicking that link would bring you directly to their product within your OpenBazaar client.

Untrue. OpenBazaar hasn't existed for years, it started in April 2014.


The product isn't finished yet. We didn't want to release a Windows build for an unfinished product.
We will be able to finish this in four months because we've transitioned from an unpaid volunteer team to having $1 million in funding and 6 full time developers. That isn't a trivial difference.

I'm one of the project leaders on OpenBazaar, and as usual there is a lot of misinformation in this sub.
OpenBazaar is doing well, it has been used by several hundred thousand people from around the world, with more than 10,000 listings available for purchase. You can browse the network here:
Many people are upset that we integrated coins other than Bitcoin, but we explained our decision for this a long time ago and I don't think it's unreasonable at all:
I personally am still a strong Bitcoin believer, I wrote one of the first books about Bitcoin back in spring 2013 and most of our team are long-time Bitcoiners. OpenBazaar was one of the first people to implement SegWit and the idea that we're anti-Bitcoin is just wrong. Bitcoin is still the most used coin on OpenBazaar.
We're about to release a mobile app which focuses on letting people trade directly with each other privately.
Some here don't like the personalities involved in the project - and that's fine, that's their choice - but because of that they don't even try the product itself, which has developed into something pretty powerful. Fully distributed network with end to end encryption, built on IPFS so data is censorship-resistant, Tor-compatible, no fees, and you hold your own crypto keys. Permissionless trade for permissionless money.
If you want to decide for yourself whether or not OpenBazaar would be useful to you, download it and see:

Well, not quite. Brian is indeed a BTC supporter, but far from the only one on the team (I'm a co-founder and BTC supporter as well), and the rest of the team are not all BCH supporters. 
Also, there's no clean separation between these things either, it's not like everyone is forced to pick sides in a crypto battle. This is a large and diverse team, many having been in the space for a long time. Lots of strong personal opinions, but it's sad that people let the developers' personal opinions shape their views about the end product.
The end product is absolutely not a BCH product, it's coin-agnostic. You can use BTC, BCH, LTC, or ZEC.

0%. There is no cut. The trade is peer to peer so there's no one in the middle to take a cut.


Currently digital content is delivered by the merchant entering a URL and a password after the buyer pays. We're looking at more sophisticated methods of digital delivery in the future.
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:47:12
I can't speak for the whole team but here's my opinion.
It basically comes down to this: We believe the benefits of decentralized trade - lack of fees, low barriers to entry, no terms and conditions, competition among dispute resolution providers, etc - are not only valuable for people who trade in the darknet. Since the vast majority of people in the world don't use the darknet, it makes sense to offer those benefits to clear net users first.
However, we aren't opposed to darknet markets. If someone wants to make it work for that, they can go for it. We might implement it ourselves eventually if no one else does the work.
But in the meantime, we feel like OB is already pretty friendly to people who care about privacy. VPNs aren't bullet-proof (though neither is Tor) but it certainly protects from most adversaries. Also, if you host your store locally, then the only way your trade can be censored (apart from losing electricity/internet) is if someone comes into your home and shuts down your computer.
@_date: 2016-02-18 15:02:40
OpenBazaar is censorship resistant. Existing e-commerce platforms are trivially censored; with OpenBazaar the only way to shut down a store is to physically shut down the computer hosting the node. It doesn't obfuscate IP address by default, but users can use a VPN they trust.

We decided to go with either direct payments, or 2-of-3 multisig with a third party for the first release. We expect that, for the average user, having a moderator who is there if something goes wrong will actually be considered useful by most users. Also, there are a handful of other existing marketplaces who offer 2-of-2, and they don't seem to be used much, at all.
But if it's a feature that enough people request, we'll likely include it down the road.
@_date: 2016-02-15 03:05:10
Why? Bitcoin itself isn't Web based. Torrenting isn't Web based. Lots of p2p isn't built on http. 
Also third party services can bridge this gap pretty easily, just as they already do with bitcoin and torrents. Bazaarbay.org already exists for OpenBazaar before it's even launched. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 12:32:32
I mentioned why we're doing that [here](
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:41:39
The network is decentralized. Users can choose to use third party services to access the network if they want to.
Do you have anything against SPV bitcoin wallets? It's the same thing. People can make the decision to run a full Bitcoin node - or not - and it'll be the same for OpenBazaar.
@_date: 2016-02-12 23:40:55
And there's no geographical restrictions either. Anyone in the world with a computer and the internet can buy or sell on OpenBazaar.
@_date: 2016-02-13 00:21:42
The three parties with keys are buyer, seller, and a third party called a moderator. If buyer and seller can't agree then a dispute is opened and the moderator works with the parties to decide how the funds should be distributed. The moderator then joins with the winning party to distribute the funds (either a refund to the buyer, release to the seller, or a split).
The moderator receives a small percentage of the overall transaction for his service. Moderators can determine this amount so there will be a market for moderator services.

You might get a more detailed response by asking in @_date: 2016-02-18 16:36:52
It's open source. We would never add fees because it goes against the goal of the project (making trade free) but it would also fail to make any money because it would be forked in a day and the fees removed.

I run my own full node because of the benefits it provides me. There are costs involved.
Everyone needs to make that trade-off for themselves, but the vast majority of end users will not think running a full node themselves is necessary.
That's already true even with the current strict limitations on block size. Most people using Bitcoin aren't running a full node, and that's fine. Their choice.

It's mostly time commitment. Going from volunteers to full time is a huge difference. Instead of coding after you get home from your full time job and after you eat dinner and put the kids to bed, it's now coding eight or ten hours a day consistently. Night and day difference.
And don't forget this is a community effort. Announcing the funding has gotten a lot more community involvement. Our community Slack - where we discuss OB and coordinate development - has grown from 80 people before the announcement to over 400 today.


We hired people who already know Bitcoin, already worked on OpenBazaar, and already knew the programming languages. It just took people already in the community and made them full time.
Plus we aren't starting from scratch. Most of the theory work was done, and nearly all of it had proof of concept code built too. Plus the OpenBazaar network already worked (though crudely) so we had some knowledge of how the code worked (and didn't) in the wild.
I completely understand your skepticism. It's ambitious to complete this by late November. We might miss the deadline, I don't know. But we're giving it our best shot, and I believe it's possible.

We did seriously consider adding a short game or something else to keep the user interested while it started. But neat stuff like that tends to fall by the wayside when there are more important things to tackle.
Alternatively, we could just wait to launch the client until all the generation happens in the background, though that's also not ideal since people won't know what's taking so long.
We're initially targeting Bitcoiners primarily, so we assume that asking for a bitcoin address isn't too much of a hassle for people.

[OpenBazaar Server]( is the back end. It's in Python and it's where all the keys management and signing happens, as well as where the DHT and networking takes place. This is mostly completed now, but we'd love to have more eyes on this.

[OpenBazaar Client]( is the front end. It's mostly Backbone JS and it's obviously the visual interface. There's more work here than on the server side, though it's nearly done now. There are lots of areas for improvement here and lots of features we want to include but were left out because of time constraints.

There are two ways to pay in OpenBazaar right now. 
1. Direct payment. This is sending the money directly to the vendor. There are no protections with this method and it should only be used for small transactions and/or with vendors that you completely trust. 
2. Moderated payment. This creates a 2-of-3 multisig with the buyer, vendor and a third party called a moderator. Most of the time the transaction goes through correctly, and buyer and seller agree to release funds from multisig. If there is a problem, then the moderator comes in and determines who is at fault, then joins with the winning party to release the funds from multisig. 
In this system, as long as the moderator is trustworthy, scams shouldn't be possible (or at least would be very difficult to pull off). 
Also, there is a review and reputation system for items and vendors. It's definitely a work in progress but it should be enough to help inform good decision making. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 23:50:31
I can't speak for all the devs, but my position is that we're agnostic as to what is listed on the platform. It's a protocol we're building, how people use it is their own responsibility. 
The confusion might stem from the fact that we've been very clear that we aren't building it *for* illegal activity. It's not a darknet market built for illicit goods. That's not a design goal, so it might not work very well for that.
But there's nothing that the devs can do to censor trade on the network, even if we wanted to. It's completely decentralized and peer to peer. Trade occurs directly between the buyer and seller, and the traffic is encrypted. The only way to censor trade is for the computer hosting the store to be shut down or go offline. Assuming the store is using a (trustworthy) VPN then really the only people who could do that are law enforcement or nation-state actors.
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:48:48
Are you stating that the difference between a vulnerability and an optimization is that an optimization allows for future changes but an vulnerability locks things in place? 
From a miner's perspective, this is an efficiency gain (optimization) and the system itself isn't harmed by more efficient hashing. It seems like a stretch to call this a vulnerability just because it creates incentives for people to prevent the system from being changed.

Or submit a pull request. We won't bite.
It's open source and has been from the beginning, if someone wanted to put in the effort to integrate Tor (and it was done competently) it'd likely be accepted. Note that it's a bit more complicated than just TCP; there's also a DHT and it's not clear how that is maintained in a network that has clearnet and Tor nodes. Possibly it just as a "clearnet mode" and a "Tor mode" and they are separate networks.
FYI, it could also use I2P, and since that's UDP it would be easier to do.
Also, you can use VPNs with OpenBazaar right now.

That seems like a reasonable constraint to me as well. 
But I'd argue that a 4MB block weight is far lower than what a medium sized business can handle. When I've done the rudimentary math it's closer to ~32MB. There's almost no question that it could be doubled or tripled from its current level without bumping up against that constraint. 
The issue is most people don't agree with that constraint. They don't think that it's about businesses being able to run full nodes, but individuals. And as you say, that means there isn't consensus (yet).
@_date: 2016-09-20 02:04:46
There are a few vendors selling precious metals now. You can search around here:
OpenBazaar should be more private than any other platform out there (except darknet markets); the transaction is just between buyer and seller without any intermediary. You can select a third-party in case a dispute arises, but they only know about the trade if a dispute is filed and they need to take action. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 03:07:14
OpenBazaar works similarly to a bittorrent node at the moment. It's not built for privacy, but appears to work fine with a VPN.
Also, there are no restrictions on what people can sell. A restriction implies there is a central party to restrict or terms and conditions to agree to, but there are none. Trade occurs directly between people, it's just like trading with someone in person, except it's online.
Unless you're considering law enforcement to be the restricting party, but that would apply to every conceivable marketplace. If law enforcement is the party which can restrict trade, then it's literally impossible for a true free market to ever exist while law enforcement exists because they will always restrict trade when possible. Even if you could make a marketplace with *perfect privacy*, they'll still restrict trade through honeypots or other methods.

It's actually two programs. One is the server, which uses APIs just like you're suggesting. The other is the client, which we built to serve as the reference client and we hope will make it easy for people to start using it as soon as possible. Anyone else can build another client that talks to the server via API, we just built the first one to get it started.

You're being misleading by presenting AB1326 as though it was one bad bill that got killed, but that's not true. It changed many times, with some changes being positive and other being negative. Coin Center supported the positive changes and opposed the negative ones.
It's simply not true that lack of legislation is *necessarily* better than having well-crafted legislation. Since there is already a massive amount of regulation in place regarding the financial sector, it's unclear how many of those rules apply to Bitcoin companies. Legislation can clarify that, and it can clarify when those rules *don't* apply, meaning less regulatory burden overall.

There would be huge incentive for the rest of the world (and every single person who holds Bitcoin) to fight against the 51% attack, either by bringing on new miners or by doing something drastic like banning Chinese IP addresses.

A majority (possibly a sizable minority) of early Bitcoiners were ideologically motivated libertarians and often sympathetic (or outright proponents) to Austrian Economics. Few were formally economists, but they understand the economic way of thinking.
As it became more about the price and store of value and less about using Bitcoin to create an alternative system, that proportion has changed and now there are a majority of ignorant get-rich-quick types who don't know the first thing about economics.

It may still matter to those who care, but the problem is then anyone who does care and uses it will stick out like a sore thumb and become obvious targets.

OpenBazaar isn't a company or even an organization. Just like Bitcoin, it's a protocol and a network, and just like Bitcoin it's completely open source and permissionless.
The company OB1 received this money. I'm a co-founder. This round was lead by Canadian pension fund OMERS, not Bitmain. Existing investors like a16z and USV were in the round as well.
You can dislike Bitmain and OB1 all you want, that's your choice. But you can't claim the dream of a decentralized marketplace with Bitcoin is dead; it's more alive than ever before. OpenBazaar 2 is built on IPFS, is Tor-compatible, and comes with a built-in Segwit wallet. We've seen tens of thousands of nodes on the network in recent months. Trade is happening, and it's private, p2p trade with p2p money.
This funding ensures that the world's only decentralized marketplace that's actually being used is going to continue improving and growing.
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:34:34


I've absolutely never bashed Bitcoin and OpenBazaar used Bitcoin solely from 2014 until the start of 2018.
You should judge the project based on whether or not the software does what you want instead of your opinion of the people building it. 
A p2p, private marketplace with no middlemen, no fees, no censorship. Useful or not?
@_date: 2016-09-17 00:57:59
To clarify: This is on OpenBazaar 2.0, not the current version which has trade occurring. Back end dev Chris Pacia got an OpenBazaar node running over Tor today. This is still early and not ready for use, but it appears it will be possible once 2.0 is launched. 
This is possible because we are switching to IPFS for 2.0, which is compatible with Tor, unlike the current 1.0 build. 
It's still months out (we aren't giving timelines) but the more people we have contributing the faster it gets finished. Anyone know Go? 
@_date: 2016-02-22 19:53:46


That's true of every existing marketplace, and it's true of every theoretical one as well. 
Tor and I2P aren't perfect, especially against nation-state actors.
Blockchain markets make the data persistent (which probably isn't a great idea if you're advertising illegal goods) but they do absolutely nothing to stop the person from getting arrested. A whole lot of good it does to have your store data in a blockchain when you're in jail.

Currency for viewing the price of listings. You can just view them in Bitcoin prices if you want, but more prefer fiat pricing.

See these are the types of questions that should be asked _before_ you claim that we're being bribed and state "the dream is over."
Monero couldn't be used because it didn't have multisig enabled until very recently, and multisig is necessary for the escrow system to function.
OpenBazaar was built on Bitcoin, and so the closer the Bitcoin's codebase a coin is the simpler the integration is. Monero is quite different.
But BCH is very similar and integration was easy. LTC is also similar and we have been working with people to implement it too. ZEC was integrated because it was similar to BTC (we don't use shielded yet) and we had some community help.
This is open source software we're talking about. Our team isn't large enough to do everything. When people volunteer to contribute we take their offer.
LN is interesting but the main devs are literally saying not to use it live yet, and also the design requires an always-on node for multisig, which conflicts with the current OB design.

Except.....we rolled out BCH and ZEC support earlier this year, and what you're describing is literally impossible because of the way the app is designed. Each listing can only accept one payment type and if you try to pay with the wrong coin it won't let you proceed through the trade flow.

OpenBazaar is being attacked right now because it integrated BCH and ZEC recently (as additional payment methods), and some people believe it should only use BTC I guess.

People who support Segwit2x aren't people who were saying "Segwit is dangerou," you're conflating groups together.
Segwit2x has a huge proportion of the economic community and miners because they wanted Segwit but it wasn't activating, and they wanted a larger block size but that wasn't happening either. So they did both and most of the community agreed it was a good idea.
Then Segwit activated. Soon a block size increase happens. BIP 148 was a non-event that most people supporting the NYA ignored because it wasn't an actual problem.

There have been numerous attempts at compromise positions over the years. NYA only stands out because it actually succeeded in activating Segwit.

I'm a co-founder of OB1 an have been involved with OpenBazaar from pretty much the start.
I get that Brian rubs people the wrong way sometimes. But let me explain why dismissing the project based on a personal dislike for the project's leadership is short-sighted.
Bitcoin is decentralized, permissionless money. To those who care about taking control away from the big, powerful institutions in society and empowering individuals, that's what's so incredible about Bitcoin. Money not controlled by banks or governments.
But even if you have the most free and unfettered money in the world, you still need a place to spend it. Unfortunately online commerce today is restricted just like the banking industry; there are a few powerful companies that monitor everyone's data, take a cut of all transactions, and censor their marketplaces for their own purposes or on behalf of governments.
So the permissionless, decentralized money revolution that Bitcoin represents is substantially weakened by the fact that there is no permissionless, decentralized marketplace.
That's why OpenBazaar is so important. It gives Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) the ability to recognize their full potential by creating a completely decentralized marketplace.
So even if you don't like the leadership in the project, I would argue that if you care about Bitcoin and individual liberty that OpenBazaar is too important to ignore. 
Also, the OP is right: OpenBazaar 2.0 is really, really good. We worked hard on it. [Give it a go](

The blockchain has recently been growing at roughly 1mb per block (about every ten minutes) because the limit is 1mb and there is more demand for transactions than there is space in blocks.
So you can see how the block size limit restrains the growth of the blockchain, because if the limit were 2mb and those blocks were filled as well, then the blockchain would grow twice as fast as with 1mb blocks.
In my opinion, a 1mb block size limit is far too low and has caused many problems. But that's an opinion, and many disagree. 
The guy who lied above about needing to download the blockchain in order to use Bitcoin is famous for believing blocks are actually too large already. Lots of different opinions on that subject.

Claiming OB is attacking bitcoin is nonsense. It uses bitcoin solely for payments and everyone controls their own wallet and can choose whatever chain they want. How is a fully decentralized marketplace where everyone uses Bitcoin and everyone can choose their chain an "attack on Bitcoin?"

In OpenBazaar there are two types of payments, direct and moderated. 
A direct payment goes from buyer to vendor with no escrow.
A moderated payment goes into a 2-of-3 multisig. If you're not familiar with that, it means that the Bitcoin are jointly controlled by three parties: the buyer, the vendor, and a moderator. Those funds are stuck in escrow until any two parties release the funds. The moderator is someone on the OpenBazaar network that both the buyer and vendor trust.
If you had a local law-firm who was willing to run OpenBazaar and act as a moderator, and both buyer and vendor trusted them, then they could offer escrow services and would only release funds after the inspection.

That's delusional. The mechanism by which Segwit was activated was a direct result of the NYA and Segwit2x, not BIP 148. 
Considering the paltry amount of support from the economic community and the complete absence of support from miners, BIP 148 would have done exactly nothing if Segwit didn't activate because of the NYA (other than cause a short-lived chain split).

XMR didn't have multisig until recently, which was a requirement, and for usability sake a SPV wallet would be very helpful. Since it's quite a bit different from Bitcoin, it's more difficult to integrate (compared to ZEC or BCH). But we'll get there eventually, I want to see XMR in OB as well.

OpenBazaar has never received a dime of investment.
OB1 has had over $4m in investments, mostly from a16z and USV. Claiming we're bought off with a $200k investment is absurd. Everyone loves to pretend that companies are evil and investments are evil but it's just flatly wrong. 
I don't begrudge Blockstream for having raised more than an order of magnitude larger amount than us from big bankers. I don't think that disqualifies them from having an opinion.

No that's not true. Block size is directly related to the size of the transactions within. If you had 8mb block size limit and only 1mb worth of transactions, the block would be 1mb, not 8mb.

The most obvious benefit is the activation of Segwit, which we're already all enjoying. 
Other than that the only major difference is a larger block weight limit, so there's more transaction capacity and - in theory - lower fees.

First of all, my comment said nothing about S2X, but was pointing out how you're violating the subreddit rules with impunity:


Spamming a canned message and links to the same post 50 times in a month surely violates that rule.
I've already responded to your false claims in the past. The title of the post you linked was "OpenBazaar's latest investment round..." which is already inaccurate. OpenBazaar has never received a dime of investment. It's not even an organization, it's an open source code base just like Bitcoin is. OB1 received the investment.
Saying OpenBazaar raised a round when OB1 raised would be like saying "Bitcoin's latest investment round...." when Blockstream raises money. It's factually inaccurate and intentionally misleading.
The DCG investment into OB1 was tiny; 95% of our investment comes from a16z, USV, and BlueYard. Pretending that if you take money from DCG you're "bought by bankers" is patently absurd. I'll mention Blockstream again as an example, they also have DCG as investors yet don't support S2X, so that's proof investment doesn't buy you support.
You've been trying to bully and silence people for a month with your "Bitcoin villains" list you keep posting, lying and saying that half of the Bitcoin industry has been bribed.
Well guess what: I've been in for five years. I didn't create an alt account one month ago in order to spam my beliefs all over the place. I'm free to support whatever vision of Bitcoin I want. I wrote one of the first books about Bitcoin in 2013, I've travelled around the world talking about Bitcoin / OpenBazaar since then and I'm involved in a project that I truly believe is the best complement to Bitcoin that exists (a decentralized marketplace for decentralized money).

Your framework is "us versus them" as if the majority of miners and a substantial proportion of the economic community were outside of the bitcoin community and decided to attack it.
Not so. 2x supporters aren't from outside the community, they represent a huge part of the community. You say 25% but you don't know if that's true, especially with all the censorship happening in the largest forums. 
You don't get to decide what consensus means. That's decided by people running software. This isn't a normative claim but a descriptive one. If you don't like the fact that consensus is decided by people running the software, you can create a different system.
But don't pretend people are violating the NAP because they have a different vision of Bitcoin and run different software than you want.

You are either lying, or you've deluded yourself if you truly believe this.
Light clients are absolutely using Bitcoin. This is how the majority of people use Bitcoin. Yes, they're not as secure as a full node, but security isn't binary. People get to make trade-offs of security and convenience themselves. 
Just because you have an opinion of how you want Bitcoin to operate doesn't mean it's how Bitcoin actually operates.
SPV clients have successfully been a part of the network for a long time, and the vast majority of users have had absolutely no problems with security. To claim otherwise - no matter how much you want it to be true - is factually false.
I personally have used various SPV clients on desktop and mobile for five years now, and never once has the marginally reduced security caused me any problems.

It's not clear that doing all of that in the same client would be preferable. Everything I've heard about that extra stuff that Satoshi put in there is that it was a security nightmare.


No, you've got your timeline wrong. Gavin visited CIA in mid-2011 and SR didn't start till later that year. [Edit: I'm wrong about this, as another user pointed out. SR launched in Feb 2011.]

There's no fee to receive a payment in OpenBazaar, unless you're talking about a payment out of an 2-of-3 multisig escrow. We don't recommend using escrow for payments that small.
You can change the fee down to economic, which takes longer to confirm but is cheaper.
This is why we implemented Segwit in OpenBazaar; for direct payments the fees are a bit lower.


I understand no one like paying any fees, but if the fees are lower than any alternatives then you shouldn't be too bothered by it. For a $10 purchase the fee might be 6%, but for a $100 purchase it's much, much smaller, whereas the other platforms always charge 10% or more.

Yes, as a percentage of the transaction, but the transaction was small because it was a test. On a normal ecommerce transaction the typical spend is closer to $50, so a 1% fee isn't too bad.

I work on OpenBazaar.
The author tested the alpha of the 2.0, so of course there are no real listings to buy or sell. The 2.0 network is in process of switching from an alpha testnet with fake listings to a live beta with real listings, but until that transition happens you can only test it, not use it for real.
It's unfortunate the author didn't read the blog or reach out to the development team even for a moment to understand what's going on, he would have found statements like this in our [user testing guide](


Fortunately we're just about to release the open beta, which can be used for real sales and purchases, so I hope the author revisits this in a week or two when it's out of alpha.
**Edit**: I explain in more detail the problems with this article in [this comment](
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:50:44
I would say OpenBazaar is here already. Any stores created during the beta will transition automatically to the full release, so anyone can set up a store now.

Previous betas have had difficulty connecting to the network without port forwarding, and also had problems with stability. This 0.4 beta moved to a rUDP network, which won't require port forwarding for most users, and it also is *way* more stable.
It also has quite a few new features, such as an internal messaging system for nodes that are online, switching over to HD keys for signing, and the ability for notaries to charge fees and send refunds to buyer or release payments to seller (in case of dispute or non-responsive party).
**Edit**: To be clear, there is still a lot of work to get to a full release, but this is the largest step forward we've taken so far.

Yes, these are good points, and we expect that notaries will reach agreements with merchants and/or buyers to offer a monthly service, and forget the current fee structure. Notary selection by buyer isn't permanent, this will change as well.

It wouldn't happen overnight, that's for sure. I share your optimism though. If you believe the future of trade is decentralized, then you need to ask how it will emerge. Someone needs to put in the time and effort to take the first steps. The OpenBazaar team hopes to be the ones to make it happen.

Digital Ocean lets you rent virtual private servers (VPS), so this service basically connects to your account, sets up an OpenBazaar node, and configures it so that you can visit it in your browser just like a website.

No it isn't. OpenBazaar isn't a supporter of anything. It can't support anything because it's not an organization, it's an open source piece of software just like Bitcoin is. Either you want a decentralized marketplace for Bitcoin, or you don't. Don't let cryptopolitics get in the way of that.

This is a low-power miner and raspberry pi (2) combined.
Only time will tell if this is ridiculous or genuinely needed. I know that for OpenBazaar, there are some neat things you can do with reputation if the user already has a small amount of Bitcoin available to them - but I'm not sure a mini-miner is the best way to make that happen.

Not true. Small transactions are direct, not moderated, so there's no payment into a multisig and no moderator fees. In fact, there's no moderator fees _ever_ unless a dispute is opened.

OpenBazaar could host listings for AirBnB-style rentals. The reputation system is really what's important. 
Also, even without a reputation component, renters could put up some kind of security bond beforehand to give the property owners some assurance. The notary (perhaps a service like AirBnB even) would be drawn in only in cases where the renter claims the property owner lied about their listing or otherwise cheated them, and in cases where the property owner claims the renter damaged property or had another complaint. The notary then decides who is at fault and releases the security deposit accordingly.

To be clear, OpenBazaar inherited python from Dark Market, we didn't choose it.

Think of it as the cost of the attack. They could pay a few thousand dollars per block to prevent anyone else from putting in valid transactions. Very cheap way to take the whole network down for hours or days.
The bigger problem is coordination though. Blocks aren't actually created every ten minutes, the lottery system just targets that time period. If the block creation occurred strictly based on a known time period then that opens up new ways to attack the system. Plus you still don't have a way to decide which block to accept - most fee block decided by who?
And there's no incentive for people to secure this network if fees are burned.
@_date: 2015-04-10 01:08:23
Essentially all commerce online is controlled by centralized organizations who take a cut of the trade and capture their users' data. Decentralization means there is no middleman, eliminating fees and preventing any one organization from collecting data.
I would argue that these benefits are significant to many people who engage in online trade.

No question about that. My observation isn't only about installation though, it's about running these on your home device 24/7. Asking content creators themselves to run all those apps all the time just seems unlikely to happen.
We have some experience with this on OpenBazaar. Our first network was always on and required people to constantly be online. It pushed people towards using VPS, and users didn't like the experience. Our new network uses IPFS to avoid the need to always be online and it's a much better UX. 
I'm interested in knowing if LN end users will have a similar experience or if it's different somehow.


Several team members are strongly supportive of BCH, but you'll find that our team is quite diverse in our opinions. You won't find me bashing Bitcoin or promoting BCH in my various online accounts. I tried out this LApp as my first attempt at using LN, which I've been watching develop for years.

OPs history is just a string of this post (or variations) over and over for weeks,  yet somehow it's not considered spam.
The whole thing is incredibly misleading or outright dishonest. DCG has small investments everywhere in this industry; that doesn't mean they control anything.
My company is an example (I'm mentioned in that list of people). OB1 received a $200k investment from DCG. According to OP they now own us - that's just stupid, since it's only 5% of our overall investment. 
DCG also invests in companies that don't agree with the NYA, such as Blockstream. In this fantasy world where they wield so much power that wouldn't make sense.
Bitcoin was in a bad place earlier this year after a long period of gridlock. The Segwit2x compromise looked like a way to finally move forward and get Segwit activated - and it succeeded! 
With a overwhelming majority of the hashing power and a large proportion of the economic community on board, 2x isn't some group of outsiders trying to exert control over bitcoin. 
OP keeps trying to drag OpenBazaar into this as well. It has nothing to do with this. It isn't an organization at all and has never received investment or taken a position on anything. You want a decentralized, permissionless marketplace that uses bitcoin? Use OpenBazaar. If you don't, then don't. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:39:45
You're implying it's impossible for the community to change consensus rules and for it to still be Bitcoin, which is an opinion you're welcome to hold but I think it's self-evidently wrong. If 99% of people agreed to change the consensus rule I guarantee you everyone would will be considering it Bitcoin and you'd be off in a corner with a few other people claiming it isn't.

@_date: 2016-10-20 20:50:55
Since we're using IPFS, and it appears that IPFS works over Tor, version 2.0 should be able to run over Tor. I'm hedging because, even though we have successfully run a v2 OB node over Tor, it was a test and we haven't yet done it at scale.

Hey I'm the "OpenBazaar dude" who tweeted this. 
*(As an aside, I've been a Bitcoiner much longer than I've been involved with OpenBazaar!)*
It's early in development (as I say earlier in this tweet thread) so the installation being difficult isn't really my main criticism here. It's about the user experience of end users needing to be on all the time and run all the various apps involved.
For a merchant to accept payments for files they need to run a full node and a lightning node and a LN payment tool and (in this specific case) the Filebazaar app as well. They need to run it 24/7, if it's ever offline then their storefront is down and they can't accept payments coming in.
Also there's the issue with routing where in order to accept routed payments, the seller needs to have made outgoing payments already. That's definitely confusing and unintuitive. You could have someone open a channel directly, but again it's unclear how anyone visiting your storefront would know how to do that, or even that they need to do that.
New networks / applications always have a period where the UX is unfriendly and no one but the people who deeply care about the technology would ever use it. We're solidly in that phase now, but I'm eager to see proposals on how to make it better.
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:23:04


I agree that's a problem. It's not convenient to need to run the app 24/7.

@_date: 2018-04-04 05:18:01
It can be trivially attacked. If blocks are created based on one known metric then one node could just propose a block with only one transaction with a massive fee in it.
The randomness of the lottery means that no one knows which node is going to be finding a block next, and that makes it much more difficult to game the system.

He said that in replying to a post which stated that the BCH chain could receive more accumulated work than the BTC chain, and only then it might be considered Bitcoin.
That's historically been the definition and the reason why BTC is Bitcoin now, not BCH. If 90% of the hashing power chose the BCH fork and it quickly outpaced the BTC chain then it would have become Bitcoin, at least in the eyes of most people.

Not surprising since it's more or less a custom raspberry pi 2 and OpenBazaar does run on a raspberry pi really well (with a bit of configuration).
People have asked me to write a guide for installing OpenBazaar on a raspberry pi and I'll definitely publish one before launch.

Remember that the point of a blockchain is arriving at consensus in a system where people don't trust each other.
Everyone needs to agree that some set of transactions is valid and gets added to the ledger in some chronological order. How is that order established? 
It's a lottery system where you buy tickets by proving you've burned a lot of electricity (proof of work). One of the miners gets lucky and everyone else validates what they found and agrees it's now part of the ledger.
Without the miners engaging in the proof of work lottery to coordinate which version of the distributed ledger is the official one, you'd just have everyone offering up transactions and soon the network would no longer be in consensus and would be completely unusable.

Where do we have 2-of-3 being implemented for marketplace escrow in a user-friendly way? As far as I know the only place that is close is Bitrated, and they are a centralized service. Some markets use 2-of-3 but they make themselves the third key.
Dismissing the use of 2-of-3 in OB is like criticizing Bitcoin for not inventing hashing or elliptical curve crypto. Sure it exists already, but it's being put to use in a way that has never been done before.
I do think a moderator market is an innovation people will find valuable. Moderation on centralized platforms is locked into the platform you use, whereas this would allow choice of moderation based on expertise or costs or their specific terms, anything.

OpenBazaar. It's open source, there are no fees, and payments are all handled in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:00:44
This is definitely a problem right now, due to the irreversible nature of Bitcoin transactions.
A solution is using 2 of 3 multisig, where buyer and seller each have a key and the third key is held by another trusted party. Most trades won't need that third party at all, but just in case there is a dispute they can resolve it.
This is how OpenBazaar works.

In your system, how is it decided which block is accepted? Different nodes will have different transactions, how do we decide which block makes it into the blockchain?
That's what mining does. It creates a lottery system where only one valid block of transactions is added and there's no disputes about it.
Consensus in an adversarial setting is the entire purpose of a blockchain and miners are the ones that write the official record everyone agrees to.

I'd like to think that's true, but I don't see evidence of it. It seems to be a "my way or the highway" approach.

@_date: 2015-03-25 21:39:33
Yeah I probably could have explained it better. But the point is that, from the user perspective, the use of multisig is all done in the background.
@_date: 2015-03-20 14:51:14
I would argue that 2 of 3 multisig isn't complicated to use with OpenBazaar at all. You don't know you're using multisig. 
After you find something you like, you send the Bitcoin where it prompts you (into the multisig), and then when you receive the product you hit 'release payment'. That's it. All the creation of the multisig, the signing, and broadcasting are done in client.

The three addresses do create the same multisig, which is a privacy concern. Even though in the OpenBazaar system those keys are only used for signing out, it would still allow people to track trade by just watching the signing keys. 
Fortunately, we've implemented HD keys for signing to mitigate this, so there's no address reuse.

I'd take this guy's word for it.
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:03:19
Three keys. Buyer, seller, and notary each have one key. It's 2 of 3 multisig. If buyer and seller are happy with the transaction, they can release funds (as seen in the video) without the notary doing anything. If there's a dispute or one party is non-responsive, then the notary can work with one of the parties to release funds.

They didn't just have control of an admin account, they used it to steal Bitcoin from various SR vendors. Since they got control by arresting an administrator, once the thefts occurred DPR assumed it was the admin, and he asked "Nob" (who was one of the corrupt agents) to take him out.
That's right, remember "Nob" from the Ulbricht criminal complaint and trial, the one who set up the original bust and hit? That's one of the corrupt feds.

In the scenario mentioned, bitcoin would go substantially higher than $20k. It might not be a likely scenario, but bitcoin simply doesn't have the supply to allow hundreds of millions of people into the system without the price going way higher than $20k.

Hey Sam from OpenBazaar here. We're reluctant to actually give a deadline because we don't want to disappoint people if some major problems come up and we miss the deadline. So please don't take this as an official announcement or anything.
However, at the current rate of development, it *should* be launched by the end of year. We'll be posting a "state of the code" blog post in the next few weeks which highlights exactly where we are at in development.
If you own a business and you want to be listed on OpenBazaar at the launch please contact me at sam and I'll make sure you're up to date.

No. Identity isn't tied to IP. We use various cryptographic keys for identity and signing (PGP and HD bitcoin keys).
It's true that your IP isn't concealed by default (it doesn't currently use Tor or I2P). But that's not the same as being tied to your IP, you can use a VPN, or someone can build an anonymizing layer on top of the existing one. 
**Edit**: The GUID itself is created with SHA256 and RIPEMD160.

@_date: 2015-03-25 20:01:32
Two possible outcomes:
1. The seller will need to contact the notary to join them in a 2 of 3 transaction to release funds. This is how it works currently.
2. Notaries will automatically sign a transaction allowing the seller to pull out funds if the buyer hasn't responded within a certain period of time. We want to put this option into the code eventually, but it would be up to all parties to agree on the details (it's optional).

The first OpenBazaar client is indeed a person to person marketplace. But the ricardian contract structure used isn't only for that application, it can be structured for any purpose. 
If you look at the theory work linked on the github page it shows several other use cases. Internet of things isn't in there yet, but I'd bet could write at length on the topic.

This is true. Making this work is complicated but most everything at this point is working well except networking. And networking is close enough that we'll put out beta 4.0 soon. 
This isn't to say that everything is built already, but the things that are built work well. The biggest gap is still the trust and reputation system, which is only rudimentary at this point (reputation pledges using proof of burn).

Let's be honest though. You really think that the majority of all the wallets and exchanges are going to sign on to BIP 148?

It's straight up dangerous for them to truly commit to BIP 148.

If I don't think that it will have an economic majority behind it (and I don't) then I shouldn't support it, all I would be doing is wasting my time and reverting back when it fails.
The best things that could happen in terms of disruption are full economic support, or zero economic support. Anything in between is a mess, and unless BIP 148 supporters abandon their campaign it's almost certain to be somewhere in the middle.

Now you switch from comparing OpenBazaar to Shopify to comparing it to a non-existent company that might exist in the future? That's hardly compelling.




Shopify doesn't let you accept Bitcoin directly, but only works with either Coinbase or Bitpay. Setting that up requires users to mess with [API keys and payment gateways]( and of course you must register your personal information with those companies and pay them any associated fees if they charge any. Whereas with OpenBazaar you accept the coins directly, no reliance on third parties, and it's way easy to set up.




The vast majority of users on Shopify pay transaction fees, and I've already pointed out in the previous response why using Bitcoin over OpenBazaar is a better experience than Shopify.




The OpenBazaar experience of downloading and installing the server and client is substantially better than Magento or Shopify or any web-hosted service. You haven't even seen it yet, how do you claim otherwise?
It also allows users to not be forced to purchase a domain and web-hosting or configure anything manually.
You like to harp on the point that Google already indexes stores, but you can't pretend that simply the act of having an ecommerce store on the web means that you'll show up in Google search results, except possibly on the 5,000,000 page which no one ever sees, as my colleague Chris points out in [his post](
Also, you mislead people when mentioning how a 'special browser' must be used. We use an URI scheme such that OB links can be posted anywhere on the web. Product discovery can take place over the existing web infrastructure and doesn't need to happen in the client interface entirely.




This isn't false on it's face, how would you know how OB installation takes place? It's incredibly easy. Amazon doesn't offer a decentralized free shopping app for download or I'd be using it for sure.




I think you know what I meant here. Shopify stores don't connect to each other peer to peer. They rely on multiple third parties to operate are centrally controlled and you need to pay to use them.




Yes, and we are building a protocol and client to make this process easier for them to do. The mere existence of TCP/IP doesn't mean it's a simple process to buy and sell things with other people on the internet. It's not easy to engage in direct trade with other people online, and we're building something to make it easy.




You're free to make as many assertions as you like about OB. You can try to provoke us developers as much as you like. Ultimately actions speak louder than words, and the revealed preferences of the market don't care what you or I think about any of this.
I'm not pretending OB is perfect and I'm not pretending that it will overthrow existing centralized markets entirely, or that it will be adopted by millions overnight. But it does give people the option to engage in trade directly with other people online, and that's something I'm confident that lots of people want. I want to help give it to them.
**Edit**: And I didn't even mention the fact that OpenBazaar allows for a free market in moderation using 2-of-3 multisig with trusted third parties holding the third key. Those third parties are selected on a marketplace and can set their own terms and their own fees, instead of being forced to rely on the dispute resolution services of whatever platform you're using (or Shopify, which doesn't even offer them at all).

OpenBazaar isn't a company though, just like bitcoin isn't a company. You can use both open source protocols for free, and there are companies who provide services to users to make money as well. 
Whereas centralized platforms aren't open source and free, and the sole purpose of their existence is profit (which certainly isn't a bad thing, but can conflict with the best interests of people using the platform).

Eventually we'll have a reputation system for people to choose moderators. Right now they'll need to do their own homework and only choose moderators based on their own research or recommendations.

The default system is 2 of 3 multisig and both parties agree to a trusted third party. So it does have escrow and the third parties are chosen on a marketplace. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:28:42
I wouldn't say that it's "not even close" to being usable for simple transactions.
The key components of OpenBazaar are the creation and management of keys, the creation, signing, and verification of ricardian contracts, the creation and management of multisignature addresses, and a network to share the contracts and multisig information.
For fixed price contracts, we already have everything working except for the networking, which is working probably 80% of where we want it to be.
If you meant that it's not ready for a mainstream audience, then I agree it will take a lot of work to get it there. But it's very close to being ready for small trade among tech-savvy Bitcoiners.

This much is clear: Two federal agents were deeply involved in communication with DPR around early 2013, mostly to extort him and sell him false information. They made hundreds of thousands of dollars doing this. At one point, they had control over a Silk Road administrator's account, which allowed them to steal Bitcoin directly. They sent this to Mt. Gox and made around $820,000.
And none of this was revealed at Ross Ulbricht's trial.

The store fronts that a user receives are similar to a webpage, but require no setup apart from optional customizations like header images or color schemes.
You can see example storefronts on the website: 
Plus, OB will have a URI scheme such that links can be used on the normal web to open a user's page in the client. So it's not just contained in the OB network but stores can list on the web as well.
@_date: 2015-03-30 01:47:59
This is very interesting, but as the paper itself admits, it has one huge drawback:


preventing bad acting sellers. The proposed reputation system may mitigate some risk, but cannot
remove the risk entirely. The Drop Zone protocol places the risk on the buyers of contraband since their
position will be known by the seller. If a bad actor decides to become a seller, it is conceivable that a
buyer’s anonymity would be compromised.
Not only that, but there's no multisig and the buyer has to send the funds directly to the seller before they ever have the goods, and simply trust them to not be scammers.
Or perhaps I'm reading this wrong? I'm admittedly biased working on OpenBazaar, which the author dismisses.
**Edit**: Also the inclusion of GPS coordinates isn't only possible over blockchains, Ricardian contracts can easily be location specific.

OpenBazaar is p2p, similar to Bittorrent. The code is split into server and client, so the server can be run anywhere and via an API it can talk to the client anywhere else.

It uses 2-of-3 multisig, with the third party being a moderator that is brought in only in disputes. Then the moderator can side with whichever party they believe is right, and sign to release funds to them.

Thanks for reminding me about moderation. OpenBazaar creates a marketplace where people can choose trusted third parties to hold the third key in a 2-of-3 multsig address, and then provide dispute resolution if something goes wrong. Those third parties can set their own terms and their own fees.
The neat part is that since it's 2-of-3 multisig, if everything goes well then the buyer and seller can release payment themselves. No fee goes to the third party; in fact they wouldn't even be aware they were selected to moderate! They only get paid if they provide a service (Unless perhaps they only offer services per subscription or something; it's a free market so we don't know yet).

It is decentralized. 
A centralized marketplace is controlled by a company or organization and acts as a central meeting place for buyers and sellers. They control the flow of trade and take a percentage.
OpenBazaar isn't controlled by any company or organization; it is a network of people running software that allows them to buy and sell goods and services directly with anyone else in the world, using Bitcoin.

The problem is there is no net neutrality *law* at all. They want to enforce net neutrality through regulation based on laws more than 80 years old. Those laws pre-date *computers*, much less the internet itself.
If there were a new law that tried to enforce net neutrality without using Title II and making the internet a utility controlled by the FCC then I would absolutely consider it.
I just can't believe a bunch of libertarians would support the FCC regulating the internet. The FCC has been a subject of ridicule for decades because of their censorship of the media.

I can't speak to how much time blockstream employees (and contractors) work on Core versus their own work, but certainly the overlap between the Blockstream and Core teams is far more significant than any other company. 
I'm telling you what the public perception is. When one company has far more developer control than any other company, and when they are more vociferous than (most) others, they are perceived as having more control. 
Do you believe there are companies more influential in the Bitcoin space than Blockstream?
Also, the argument "well we aren't really that powerful" doesn't seem to make sense alongside the "corporate takeover" line. If the most well-funded Bitcoin company with the most influential developers can't exercise control over Bitcoin, then who possibly could?

Bitcoin is only half the equation for free trade. Our money may be decentralized, but the vast majority of our trade online is still centralized. 
OpenBazaar brings the benefits of decentralization to online commerce and together with Bitcoin means people can engage in trade without any intermediaries at all. For free. 
No fees, no censorship, no terms and restrictions or accounts to sign up for, no central organization collecting data about your commercial habits. Just direct trade between people buying and selling goods and services to each other - anywhere in the world.

OpenBazaar definitely isn't easy to install at this point. The devs know that, since it's in beta we're focusing on getting the networking and stability fixed before making the install easier, since we're explicitly asking for more tech savvy beta testers (check out our blog post on the subject). 
However, we know installation is hugely important, and future releases will focus on making this easy.

I work on OpenBazaar. 
I don't think that we are going to see a mass exodus from the existing platforms to OpenBazaar any time soon, for a few reasons. 
The most obvious is the network effects. People use the big sites because they have millions of people buying from them. OpenBazaar has zero people at launch, and it makes no sense to jump ship and save on fees if you limit your audience severely. 
Another reason we won't likely see rapid adoption is that OpenBazaar relies on bitcoin. Of course we love bitcoin, and it allows us to do direct trade at almost no cost and with secure escrow (multisig). But in the mainstream e-commerce world there is still very low adoption of bitcoin. Our market is initially limited to the bitcoin community, which is growing but still quite small compared to everyone shopping online. 
I believe that we will see the use of OpenBazaar more as a settlement platform than a marketplace for a while. People will dual list on the regular platforms and on OB, and they will offer a discount on OB to create an incentive for their buyers to install it and use it. Over time if enough people do this then a marketplace emerges that isn't dependant on the existing platforms. 
I have no idea how long this will take. I'm very excited to launch and see how it goes!

Hey everyone, OpenBazaar dev here. 
I totally understand the confusion, we did plan on doing monthly releases and we've definitely failed to deliver on that. Our last release was 3.0 in November, so we're a few months behind. We got a bit too ambitious!
However, things are going quite well. We travelled to FOSDEM in Brussels a few weeks back to [present]( OpenBazaar, which went well. We also [won]( (along with Storj and a few others) the Black Duck Open Source Rookie of the year award. These are important because they've brought more  interest and developers into the project.
The slow down in releases is due primarily to the fact that the networking code needed major updates, and it was being done mostly by one dev, Brian. It took a long time to switch over to a RUDP network, and it requires a lot of testing and whatnot. The number of changes from 3.0 to 4.0 are massive, most of the previous updates are more incremental, but this one is significant. We're also working on the GUI changes for 5.0. I don't have a definite date for either release, but if you take a look at the open pull requests, you'll see that the major pull requests are already into the develop branch. Once they're merged, it's just testing and then we merge to master and it is released.
A lot of behind the scenes work is getting done. If there are any devs out there who want to help, please let me know. We've got a Slack that we coordinate plans in, it's got over 50 people now but if you're serious about contributing there's always room for more.

Shopify requires a monthly fee ranging from $9-$179. 
OpenBazaar is free to use.
Shopify charges 2.4% of each sale plus $0.30 for each credit card transaction.
OpenBazaar has no transaction fees.
Shopify requires integration into an existing webpage, meaning a user must be paying for a domain and web hosting and must be able to configure their site to use Shopify.
OpenBazaar requires no web hosting and no manual configuration of anything, just download and install.
Shopify is not a network of users.
OpenBazaar is a community of people who can engage in trade directly with each other anywhere in the world using only their computers, the OpenBazaar software, and Bitcoin.
OpenBazaar isn't a panacea, nor will the first version be perfect. Skepticism is warranted, but simply labeling it a shitty version of an existing product isn't accurate or fair. Wait until it's released and had time for adoption - at the very least - before passing judgement.

I'm sure that they'll have nearly universal support to weed out the people abusing children, but the phrase "getting rid of any sort of illicit activity in bitcoin" is concerning.
Who determines what illicit means? It doesn't seem likely to mean illegal, since laws vary so widely from country to country. Plus, not everything illegal is immoral, and lots of countries have laws that are themselves immoral and enforcing them would be immoral.
I realize these are my own value judgments, but they have the same problem if they're trying to define illicit as meaning "immoral." Not sure who decides what that means.

I didn't watch the video but the quote that OP selected is just wishful thinking. Compare the size of the cryptocurrency market - even assuming substantial growth from its current size - and it's still dwarfed by dozens of other markets that have way more resources and political clout.
Also, having huge amounts of money isn't enough to get agencies to go along with your plans. Regulatory capture is complex and not just about people greasing palms. These agencies exist largely in order to justify their own existence (and budgets) so just having them do nothing isn't going to work.

Not sure about hard evidence, but one of the main benefits that OneCoin claims is the fact that they are centralized and they implement KYC (meaning it can't be used for illegal activity).
All you need to ask your relatives is how this is different than PayPal. They are centralized and don't allow illegal activity either. Plus, people actually use PayPal, and they make money already.
Bitcoin is unique because of its decentralization, and they would need to explain how a centralized cryptocurrency is possible and why it is useful. If they can't explain that (and trust me, they can't) they have no business putting money into it.

Clarifying the title of the post: In the current version of OpenBazaar, there is no built-in wallet, so users need to use a wallet external to the app in order to make purchases.
This gif shows the new process for OpenBazaar 2.0, launching soon, which has a wallet built into the application. Instead of being forced to use an external wallet, you can pay into the OB wallet (keys controlled by the user locally) and then make payments as shown in the gif.
The whole purchasing flow is very smooth and we cannot wait to get OpenBazaar v2 into users hands soon.

Down initially, and then it depends on how bad the worldwide economy is. 
If it's not so bad, it stays low. 
If it's bad, then countries will begin implementing capital controls, and at that point I think bitcoin could increase rapidly. 
If it's really bad, then it's hard to say. If there's social instability then a digital currency probably isn't that useful short term, but could be very valuable medium to long term if nation states all over the world destroy their own currencies via inflation.

Yes, it is. Chargebacks are possible with PayPal, and impossible with Bitcoin (currently). So the seller takes all the risk.

It's true that decentralized reputation is still an open challenge, but there are some ways to make it good enough to use for most transactions.
Moderators can  make their real identity known, and several already do this. If you're able to know their real identity then collusion becomes much less likely, and you're also able to judge them more easily based on their credentials.
Moderators also can do things like publicly agree to use a certain moderation policy, as several do now:
They can obviously violate those policies, but a wronged party can provide evidence of this with the contract when the dispute is closed and warn others.
A side note: It appears that many - possibly the majority - of transactions are done with direct payment and don't even use the multisig. People are willing to place trust in the vendors in many cases, for whatever reason. Everyone has a different risk preference.

Everyone knows there is speculation occurring with Bitcoin, in fact, it seems that most people are engaging in it themselves (on different levels).
Since speculation is occurring, if something happens to shake confidence, or some of the larger speculators decide they should cash out quickly, then it could easily collapse the price. 
The real question should be this: why do you have bitcoin? If you have it because you think it will increase in value, then you are speculating yourself and should recognize that. If you have it because you think it is a great idea and want to use it, then the price shouldn't be all that important to you.
I think it will drop in value within the next few weeks, but obviously no one knows.

While I agree with your rule, I disagree with your assessment of Bitcoin.
You note that tax evasion and criminal enterprise are made easier with Bitcoin as if it were a fault of the technology, but the code itself is neutral, it is just being used in ways you dislike.
The fact that it can be used in those ways is actually one of its greatest strengths, the fact that Bitcoin gives people *control over their own money.* What they choose to do with that control is their own responsibility. I think it will be mostly good things.

Have you considered that the government might want to target bitcoin on behalf of the banks?
How does the government benefit from allowing eminent domain abuse for private developers? How does the government benefit from giving intellectual monopolies to Monsanto or corporate welfare to GM, GE, or Boeing?
The government is a coercive tool that is often up for grabs to the highest bidder. Just because someone is paying (either monetarily or for political support) for these actions doesn't mean that the institution itself isn't the problem.

As an introduction to mining, I think it's a great way to do it. I learned a lot setting up bfgminer on Linux Mint, which took a little bit longer than I thought it would. I also learned about mining pools and how to contribute to one of them.
I think mining is becoming a specialized service. There's a possibility that enthusiasts will join together to get the larger rigs themselves, but I think the days of individual miners mining at home are coming to a close.

Part of the benefit of Bitcoin is the privacy involved, and I'd rather not compromise that by listing all my purchases.

@_date: 2013-10-05 23:47:53
I'm not feeling bad, it was a free miner and I knew it wasn't going to bring in much. 
I hear what you're saying about the future value increase, but let's be honest about the returns here. It created about 0.007 BTC a week for me. That's about 0.02 a month, and I could only get a few months in before the difficulty significantly increases again. So I might get 0.10 out of it, for a year or so of time. Even if Bitcoin reaches $1,000, that's $100, which sounds like a lot but considering the fact that I would have to run the thing constantly, using up a computer and a fan, it's not worth it when I can just add an extra 0.1 BTC to total the next time I buy some coin.
And thanks for the investment advice, but I've been involved with Bitcoin for some time. I'm primarily using paper wallets, and obviously a small amount on my phone as well.
Happy cake day.

I'm sure this is well meaning advice, but having separate bank accounts can actually be very harmful to a relationship. What you would be doing is actively making your financial decision *less transparent* to your spouse. 
I'd recommend keeping the funds together, and working on the gambling problem. If your wife is good with money, give her more control over the funds. And if the problem is really bad, remember that Bitcoin isn't as important as your marriage. It's harder to spend fiat gambling, so maybe you shouldn't use Bitcoin.
Good luck.

What I mean is that the hashing power of these is so small compared to the more advanced mining rigs that you aren't really doing anything to help the network. You'd have to have 1500 of these to do the same a one of the new 500gh/s rigs, and those will sell hundreds. 
If we were talking about millions of people running these in the background and without concern for profit, I might understand, but unless you have huge numbers of people doing it (and we don't), they really won't have much impact on the network moving forward.

In case this isn't clear to anyone, let me answer some commonly asked questions using these rules.


No. A loan is money you don't have, therefore you can't afford to lose it.


Can you afford to lose your 401k completely? Really? If so, the answer is still no. Diversify. Half Bitcoin, a quarter precious metals, a quarter mutual funds. Or whatever.


You can't. You didn't use two-factor authentication.


You can't. You should have used cold storage.

Show me your stats.
Considering that these are selling for about as much as you claim to have mined in a week, I'm extremely skeptical. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:55:15
No you're fine asking questions, that's why I'm doing this.
Two-factor means that you need to confirm you are really you in order to access your funds in an online wallet or exchange. This prevents someone from getting into your account and stealing your coins just by guessing your password (don't ever rely on just a password).
Typically it is done with authy, Google Authenticator, a SMS code send to your phone, or a yubikey. There are lots of different options, but not having any two-factor in place shouldn't be one of them.
Cold storage means that your private key isn't on a computer that is connected to the internet. That means either storing them on an offline computer or using a paper wallet. If you do either, make sure you've googled around and found out the proper procedure for them.
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:46:52
Something that hasn't been mentioned in this discussion is the differences in the use of language between Western and Eastern cultures.
Most Western cultures are low-context languages, meaning that what it written is very literal and not dependent on the context of who is writing it, who is reading it, and other circumstances.
Many Eastern languages are high-context languages, meaning that the actual content of the message is very dependent on who writes it, who reads it, and other circumstances. It isn't always the literal interpretation that is the most accurate.
This confuses Western readers, because we are interpreting what is written literally, but a native reader understands the context behind what is written.
*Bottom line: Trust Bobby Lee's interpretation and don't try to interpret this so literally, that's not how it works.*
@_date: 2013-10-05 16:09:56
**The bottom line**: *It isn't worth the time to use these anymore, other than maybe learning the basics of mining.*
I joined Eligius for a week with a USB miner I got as a gift. I hadn't done mining before, so I thought it would be fun to learn.
Eligius has a payout threshold before you receive any coin, set at 0.16 BTC right now. It would have taken another **4 months** of mining to get there, *if the difficulty didn't increase* at all! 
All in all, a week of mining earned me about 85 cents.
I know this isn't a shock to anyone, but we've seen some folks here recently who are buying these just to "help the network." It's a nice sentiment, but the technology has just moved too quickly for them to be viable.
One last note: Anyone looking to buy a USB miner? I'll sell it dirt cheap.
**Edit:** I've already had multiple people make offers for my USB miner. Can I ask a serious question? Based on these stats, **why are people still buying these?** I think they're great to learn mining on, but I doubt everyone buying these is just getting them for educational purposes. I'm not a math whiz, but unless you purchase these for a couple dollars there's almost no chance of them every having a positive ROI, especially when you consider the opportunity cost of just buying BTC directly. 
So what is driving demand here?
