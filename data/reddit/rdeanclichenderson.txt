I'm guessing that's an exchange or web wallet based on the coins being swept from it. Not exactly a huge deal for such a small amount of money but definitely look into storing your coins locally (just don't forget to have multiple backups in different locations). Hardware wallets are the best option because they keep your private keys offline while still allowing you to make transactions but they're not cheap. Mobile wallets are a good option for that amount of money as long as your phone is not rooted/jailbroken.

It's 1/10 minus fees. But yeah, it's kind of annoying.

You are not liable for fraudulent transactions on your bank account. The only real risk is not being able to pay bills while the bank refunds your money, but that shouldn't take more than a few days. 
It makes sense to use credit cards (not debit) for most transactions because then if someone steals your info they aren't stealing *your* money, they're stealing the bank's money. But in situations like this as well as with brokerage accounts and whatnot there's really no other option and ACH is the way to go. It's also how I pay my credit cards... do you send them a check in the mail or something?

Why not? You can buy bitcoin for 0 fee with them if you use ACH and limit orders on GDAX.

Technically, you do need to report capital gains even if you don't owe anything.

This is why you dollar cost average instead of buying all at once after the price doubled in a month and went 10x in a year and a half. If you can't risk losing that money, sell. If you can afford to lose it, buy more at regular intervals and forget about the price.

Feel free to ask me any questions but I rarely check my inbox on reddit so just reply to this comment and I'll probably find it eventually. Cheers, and welcome to bitcoin.

Buying once a week is a great idea. It's called Dollar Cost Averaging and it's the best way to get exposure to an asset without accidentally going all in at a top. 
But you're gonna get eaten alive by fees if you use your debit card (they list it as 4% which is ridiculous). If you connect your bank account then it says it's 1.5% which is better but still ridiculous. Cheapest way is to connect your bank account, do ACH transfers (0 fee) to Coinbase once a week, then once it arrives transfer that money to their trading platform, GDAX, and buy there. GDAX fees are 0% for limit orders and 0.25% for market orders.
And before you do any of that you should enable 2-factor authentication. And do a heck of a lot more research. Coinbase isn't really a "wallet" in the fullest sense of the word. When you have bitcoins on Coinbase you don't actually have any bitcoins because they are the ones who hold the private keys, not you. But you should definitely do more research and get some practice with real wallets before you start storing large amounts locally. Always have backups in multiple locations.

When price is going down, it makes more sense to place a bid than to buy at spot. When price is going up it's the opposite. This is why it's pretty typical for the depth chart to look opposite of what you might expect. The depth chart can also be very misleading, as not every order is placed with the intention of getting filled.

Just treat it like a retirement account, but only investing money you can afford to lose completely. It's that simple.
