You’re better off putting that $20 into other projects. If you think about your investment of $20 now into BTC, for it to turn into $40, BTC would have to double, which right now, seems like a long way away. 
Do your own research and invest the $20 into a smaller scale project that may x10 in the time that BTC will x2.

I’m not going to recommend any coins for you as I don’t want to shill anything on here.
I’d rather have 200 coins of an upcoming project that may x10 than 0.0000001 of a bitcoin that may x2 with my budget, but that’s just my opinion.  
If you can invest $20 a week into BTC then by all means do, it may be a safer investment in the long term, maybe BTC will reach 100,000 and your 0.000001 of a BTC will be worth more than my 200 coins of an upcoming project. Who knows at the end of the day. Do what you can with your budget, simple.

There are obviously scam coins out there, or coins with no real value or goal in mind, however, labeling all crypto currencies a scam is probably ignorant for the same reason you believe bitcoin isn’t a scam .. why is bitcoin different to the others in your mind?
