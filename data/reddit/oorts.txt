I love coinbase, doing the best they can to scale with the massive increase in cryptocurrency interest and even offering a back end exchange where users can buy / sell their digital currency with no trading fees and no withdrawal fees! I think we all have to give a lot of credit to coinbase for helping the bitcoin and altcoin communities scale to massive proportions, and I am so glad they have always been around and will always be around :)

People trading altcoins who are making massive gains on these ridiculous pumps are fools because they’ll have to pay capital gains on their trades?

If I invest into "shitcoins" and 10x my money then convert it back to bitcoin, I'll still feel great even paying more in taxes. Sure calculating capital gains on each trade is a pain but I'll have substantially more money than someone who simply held BTC.

It seems so obvious that an deflationary coin is not at all effective as a currency because it only increases hoarding and discourages spending. Unfortunately it seems Bitcoins only future will be as a store of value, and not a very good one considering the steep costs for sending it and the intangibility of it.

I'm holding Bitcoin and alts myself, have been holding for about a year, and held the opinion that bitcoin was experiencing healthy growth until this disgusting bull run from ~9k to ~16k. Let me ask you, what is the magical application of bitcoin beyond as a P2P electronic currency (which was of course outlined in the Bitcoin whitepaper). The store of value meme is never what bitcoin was intended to be, the whole purpose of Bitcoin was to bank the unbanked, to allow anyone with a computer, despite status or wealth, to be able to store and spend their money as they please. Transaction fees are becoming ridiculously massive unless you are willing to wait days to send money. You have become deluded by your fantasies of attaining massive wealth, it is important for you to understand that bitcoin is barely functional as what it was always intended to be, and speculation and manipulation are fueling this bull run at a very unsustainable rate.

It's super obvious Bitcoin is in a bubble. The adoption is increasing because people think they can make money, not because they believe in the tech or have even a semblance of understanding as to what it is. All the new people investing in Bitcoin just want to see their money grow and cash out into fiat, Bitcoin will NEVER function as a currency and is nothing more than a vehicle for speculative investing. A shitty bloated congested PoW coin like bitcoin will never be able to scale to support an economy, and the sooner you accept that the better.

Exactly why I'm holding Monero and coins with an emphasis on privacy and stealth addresses.

It isn't really feasible to use gold to pay for everyday things like a cup of coffee or a book for instance, and originally Bitcoin was intended to function as a censorship resistant and secure currency that would allow for just that. Sadly, Bitcoin is no longer even remotely functional for transactions under thousands of dollars. Store of value is an absolute joke and a coping mechanism used by the bitcoin community to justify the massive failure that bitcoin core has become. Bitcoin Cash attempts to provide a solution but just further centralizes the network. Personally I like Monero because it has much superior tech to bitcoin, but if it grows to the size of bitcoin it will just encounter the exact same scalability issues that bitcoin has.

Bitcoin is barely even functional as a currency. Steam, one of the few companies that accepted bitcoin, is discontinuing support for Bitcoin purchases because of the insane fees and seldom usage. Millions of tethers are being printed that are more than likely not backed by anything (Tether refuses an audit but don't worry, they give us their word that each tether is backed by a US dollar!), pumping the value of BTC. The mempool is getting ridiculously clogged. The lack of regulation so far means that things like wash trading and the likes are running rampant and abundant. I'm not trying to FUD Bitcoin, I am only stating some clear observations that run contrary to the insane bull run Bitcoin is having. Nothing about this astronomical growth feels natural.

Good job buying on Coinbase! Enjoy the high fees and inability to transfer without paying a third of your investment in fees alone. At least transfer your BTC to GDAX and change it to LTC so you can exchange it for altcoins that are actually functional.
