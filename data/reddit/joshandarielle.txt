Honestly, I think bitcoin's biggest problem right now is how hard it is to get started with bitcoin. I once tried to get my SO to start using it (and she would have actual uses for bitcoin because of her side job), but she could not comprehend how to bitcoin in general. If only bitcoin was more "user friendly" though....

No, she's a college student who sells art and hand made jewelry to pay for tuition.

More people work in the intelligence community than you think, and they sure as shit wouldn't want to give their sources away to the public (most of the time, the source is themselves​), so they make unsubstantiated claims on the internet, which are in a way, become a self fulfilling prophecy that proves itself true with time. Seen it before, will keep seeing it in the future. Should I say you should believe everything you read? Absolutely not, but try to remember as much of these types of claims as you can, because some of them actually end up becoming public knowledge. Whenever I see this, I always think to myself of how we live in strange times.

Remember when the "official" story was only one lone gunman during the Vegas shooting? Well, that is until someone leaked "unverified" information which led to more and more people verifying the claim over time. And here we are, where witnesses against the official story are mysteriously dropping dead in their garages, dying in suspicious car crashes, one guy was even outright murdered, etc which screams cover-up of what really transpired. Talking about flat Earth, hollow Earth, etc is just unfair as those are wholly elaborate conspiracy theories that cannot be proven due to the fact that we have science to disprove those theories.

And you might as well believe in every "official" story put out there by the powers that be instead of thinking for yourself.

I'm sorry if I am missing something, but what does this have to do with bitcoin?

Ah, preaching about evidence even though my point is literally about paying attention to evidence that goes against the official narrative. Nice.

Sounds like a typical Reddit comment reply
