Dear Robert,
Thank you for contacting me about Bitcoin. I appreciate hearing from you.
As you may know, Bitcoin was first introduced as a digital payment system in 2009, and has been described
as either a digital currency or a digital commodity. It allows for pseudo-anonymous transactions without
third-party involvement.
Since its introduction, Bitcoin's value and popularity have increased dramatically. Users may appreciate its
low transaction costs and increased privacy. Because Bitcoin does not require a third-party intermediary,
transactions may be less expensive than traditional online payment systems.
Use of Bitcoin, however, is not without risk. For instance, Bitcoin has experienced tremendous price
volatility. In addition, Bitcoin networks have struggled with security. One of the most popular Bitcoin
exchanges, Mt. Gox, was recently forced into bankruptcy following a security breach that led to a loss of
more than 800,000 Bitcoins.
I look forward to learning more about Bitcoin and other digitial currencies. In the meantime, please be
assured that I understand your views on Bitcoin and value your input. I will keep your thoughts in mind as
work continues on this important is sue.
Thank you again for your correspondence. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of
Pat Toomey
U.S. Senator, Pennsylvania

Bitcoin wasn't made for speculation and trading. It is a fact this is what drives Bitcoin the most these days. 
Bitcoin is all about its protocol and the power it can deliver in the form of a new currency. 
Scenario's like this are scenario's we've created ourselves, setting up exchanges to profit from it, but all on our own without the gov. backing it. Everybody knows that, so everybody should store their largest amount of BTC on a much safer place (like everybody is always told 10000+ times), and trade with the part they are able to lose when the shit hits the fan. 
When we are finally at the point BTC is adapted everywhere worldwide, we don't need bank like systems to safe our asses, indeed. And that's what Bitcoin is all about. This is just noise generated during the development of a new currency which is getting a lot of attention and makes it grow freaking fast in a (too?) small period of time.

Cloudflare revoked the certs which were in used during the existence of Heartbleed. Now the certs are really expired and not all sites have replaced their certs yet (like Blockchain, Bter, etc). 
For example,  doesn't show any problems. When examining that cert you will see it was installed on the 15th of April, so it's renewed, which is nice and why Kraken doesn't show an error.

Maybe cloudflare is patching some Heartbleed things. Cloudflare the service used by both sides to protect agains DDOS attacks. 
More info, it is a Cloudflare problem;

If I understand you right, you can't log in anymore to access your webwallet @ blockchain.info. 
I know someone who had the same issue using lastpass or another password manager. The password manager messed it up, it auto-filled in a wrong password, but not the one he had chosen. He didn't know the password from the head either, because it was also random generated. Solution was a backup function in the password manager, he clicked te option to restore the last backup or something. After this the right password was auto-filled into blockchain.info when visiting.

Windows 8.1 has everything (and more) iOS and Android has. The average customer does not care how late a product came out. MS is on schedule now and prob will gain much more marketshare in the coming years, after people started to see WP is great. The price/quality of a Lumia 630 for example is much better than a Android device in the same price range, because Android is slow on slow hardware, but WP performs. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:22:40
The coins weren't sold on an exchange, so it didn't affect the price other than needless panicking by dumb-asses

Two friends of mine decided to buy bitcoin yesterday for the first time. After they completed, I reffered them to this sub for a nice overview on the latest daily btc news. 
Today they are finding the top two hot topics, Apple and Uber accepting bitcoin. Ow wait... it's a joke.. 'hah'... Humor is a good thing, but I think when it overtakes, it can get in the way of bringing the serious message of what Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 12:38:39
I think the derivation was [blockchain.info]( so that would be m/44'/0'/0'
Is the number of addresses coming from such a script limited? Might take a pretty long time to brute force this :)
@_date: 2019-01-30 17:13:01
Address is used. That site looks very good, let's give it a try
How do you check if an address is used? I guess it would be to extensive to query an API for every address found to check if there are related tx's?
edit: I've used the 'Scan All' option and it found nothing... should I doubt the validity of my seed from which I extracted the xpub?
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:07:15
This. 
I have: seed, bitcoin addy.
Q: is bitcoin addy an addy which might come from the seed I have? How do I extract all possible bitcoin addresses from a seed to check? 
I know I can see the xpub from the seed, xpub is (afaik) used to derive public addresses from, so how can I calculate that the address that I have can be derived from the seed/xpub?
@_date: 2019-01-30 12:39:01
That's a nice out of the box thought, will keep that one in mind, thanks
@_date: 2019-01-31 17:15:30
I did not know about the hardened derivation path and those differences that it brings yet. Will read up on it, thanks for all the info.
@_date: 2019-01-30 11:22:46
Can you please elaborate? My question is how to check if a bitcoin address originated from a given seed.

This was long possible already. I don't get how people lose ~100 btc and not monitor every day for news about the MtGox debacle. And right now don't even google how to claim them. How would one believe you really owned that much then? The only other options are you don't care about money (which I find hard to believe because you got involved with bitcoin) or you are already very rich and now seeing this reddit post by coincidence.

You can read Paul Vernon's view on this over here: 
@_date: 2015-10-19 11:41:42
Why the down votes? I'm just pointing out on his view. People really hate Cryptsy over here. Who's having withdraw problems lately? They sure have their problems, every exchange has. But I'm sure people just love to bash Cryptsy. Meanwhile they've survived most other exchanges.. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 17:40:26
Cryptsy posted a reaction: 
Quoted as mirror:
I feel I need to give a response to the recent Coinfire article.   Like their previous article, they’ve make a lot of claims without giving any kind of proof to their claims.   I know many people don’t take coinfire very seriously these days, which is good.   However there are some out there that may not really know that the kind of “News” these guys produce is not always reliable.
We have never been investigated for anything, period.  We have never gotten any letters from any of the agencies that they have stated in their article, nor have we been contacted via phone or any other method.  It’s safe to say that this article and their reporting are completely false.   My guess is that whomever wrote this article has personal reasons for writing it and are attempting to hurt our business and reputation.
We will be reviewing our legal options against this libelous article.

Did you verify your account? Cryptsy wants to adapt to the new regulations. Your withdraw looks like it fell in between. You can now only withdraw larger amounts with a tier 1 or tier 2 verified account. Try that. Also try to go into the chat and give your ticket number to a mod. I've seen a couple of people over there with the same problems and what I know of their tickets got resolved. They are extra busy these days because of the new verify system they had to implement because of govt regulations..
