Why are you helping him get away with shitty behavior?

It's one of my go-to examples of how ridiculously inefficient capitalism can be, which makes it all the funnier that it's the die-hard free market fetishists who love BitCoin most of all.

This is actually my favorite scene in The Simpsons. I remember laughing so hard that I cried and and could barely breathe.
It fits *perfectly*, by the way, so kudos to you OP.

This is what bitcoin zealots actually believe.

Not really. For finer details, sure, but at its core it is against hierarchies. "An"-caps and other such free-market fetishists are not anarchists. They worship capitalism (the strongest hierarchy there is), so their faith is incompatible with anarchism.

Are you a caricature of a person? I'm beginning to wonder if you're just trolling.


lol you clearly have no clue what you're talking about. Ancoms and similar anarchist communities are highly successful when they're small. The problems come when they try to expand too far since the overarching system is incompatible with that. Plus, y'know, Machiavellian power dynamics and all that.
For the record, though it shouldn't really matter, I'm not an anarchist. I've simply read a lot of their stuff and am sympathetic to many of their ideas.

The article could indeed use an edit.
It's already in there that it's considered hogwash by actual anarchists, but of course the whole article is phrased in such a way that it's just a disagreement within the ranks.
It's a little bit like someone claiming to be a feminist and then wanting women to be subservient to men. It goes against the whole basic concept of the definition, but people can of course call themselves whatever they want...

Anarchism is quite a bit older than the nonsense that is anarcho-capitalism.
Some of the very things that Proudhon warn us about, like feudalism reborn, are things that "an"-caps effectively want society to be like.

*They worship capitalism*
It's not about what they want, it's about the result that we see around us every day and the inherent flaws in the system.
This shouldn't be hard to understand unless you ARE an "an"cap, in which case why am I talking to you.

I paid attention to what you said in the previous post. And you're still doing it in this one by claiming all kinds of dysfunction.


Of fucking course there are. The entire world is still capitalist.
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:53:01
I'm not. I'm arguing against it in this very thread.
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:00:07
I don't even know where to begin with this utter nonsense, but I guess [this is a good start.](
Also, anyone even hinting at the idea that a world where 60~ people own as much as half of it and where almost half the world's children live in poverty is a **fair** world has their head so far up their ass that their head is now where their heart was supposed to be.
Also also, sod off with the juvenile NAP crap. You ask 50 right-libertarian chuckleheads what constitutes an NAP violation and you get 100 different responses. It's the most teenage, useless concept ever conceived.

That's not what anarchist means at all.

Scandinavian checking in calling bullshit on this post.
It's not about homogeneity, it's about what comes before that: equality.
High taxation works just fine here.

I have absolutely no problems with selfish people leaving; the hole you leave behind will be filled by someone who hopefully aren't as much of an ass.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:39:15
Meh, blow it out your ass.
Your chicken little spiel has been said for ages now, and we're still doing just fine.
