* hardfork occurs. Miners start mining other worthless altcoins while they wait it out.  Ver starts pumping BTC instead of BTU becoming 90% of the hashrate.

So every single person that is selling something deserves to spam this forum because they accept bitcoins?  Please.
First of all, here is why I decided to post and what I don't agree with.  
Freecast has **illegally** obtained m3u keys on the neulion network (which is a content delivery system that is used by the NFL).  
Freecast then sells these "hijacked" keys to unassuming people (YOU).  This is highly illegal and a [felony in about every single state]( because now you are NOT accessing the game by viewing it on Freecast's servers, you are accessing Neulion/NFL's servers via hacked/cracked/shared auth keys (kind of like Freecast selling you username and passwords to Gamepass and you logging in and using them).  
Technically when you visit Freecast, a url is embedded on the website that makes your computer make an unauthorized connection to neulion / gamepass via cdnak.neulion.com/nlds/nfl or similar with the unauthorized/hacked/shared key embedded in the m3u file.   There is a BIG difference between viewing a stream on some sports streaming website, but another story when you're logging into THEIR (NFL) network with unauthorized/hacked keys.  It becomes piracy (we all don't care) to a hacking charge and you fucking pay $ for it!
He has decided to CHARGE you for this service which is/was free to redditors that knew where to look.  So, yeah don't support scum like this.

You realize both NFL2go and freecast are literally the same thing. Maybe different owner, but..
 They both steal the neulion m3u keys and embed the neulion link.  You are literally watching the same thing, from the exact same network (neulion/gamepass).  So what you are experiencing is placebo or you were on a congested network.  
How they work is basically they steal/share/hack the keys, then when you browse the site (NFL2go/freecast) they tell your browser to connect to the neulion network (NFL Gamepass) with an key file (attached to someones account).  You then connect to the Official Gamepass network (neulion), and they stream the video to your computer.  So technically you are "hacking" gamepass.  These site do not record the broadcast and stream them back to you as most people think, they make your computer connect to NFLs network with cracked/hacked keys and you get the video straight from NFL.
