It didn't verify for me at the start also.
But it was just me being scatterbrained and not knowing how to use Gpg4win/Kleopatra. 
After fine-tuning it, It verified for me.

Well, shit. 
While I don't usually browse shady websites and have noScript installed (but JS enabled because I use some scripts), I DO check my HODL wallet occasionally, that I have in my laptop, always connected to the internet.
Just how much I fucked up? I'm about to find out right now.
Also, them Google Project Zero guys sure are on a roll, first Meltdown and Spectre, now this.
Edit: Funds are SAFE!, now I wonder if I need to move them elsewhere.

Programmers love JavaScript for the things it can do.
Security Consultants hate it for the same exact reason.

Thank you, i think this might work.

Nope, has to be from aliexpress, since the 3G dongles are dirt cheap there (around 10$ a piece), and a pack of them can give me enough profit to cover their cost and legally start a business.

The price went down over the weekend and i panicked, but didn't sell because i hoped it would go up again, and it did. But NOW it is going down AGAIN. What sort of roller coaster have i gotten myself into?

I predict the frontpage of this sub will be full of vegeta memes. Hell, the 10 most upvoted post on r/all will be just that.

Venezuelan here. Can someone tell me where to get a bitcoin debit card? I used to use Uphold, but they disabled it.
I was going to buy some stuff that I needed for work here.

To be fair, I'd rather take that risk than stick with bolivares. The price of non-controlled VEF is falling [each day.]( Currently it is 8400 VEF a dollar, the year before was 1000, and just 500 in 2015. Whatever happens to bitcoin, I expect it to go up again, no such case with VEF.
I already Googled around a bit, seems like keeping the bitcoins in a personal wallet, and keeping that wallet inside my HDD will save me if a split happens, and i could just use the chain with the highest usage.
I could be wrong, however. So if you could provide me with what you said, i would be really grateful.
