How about doing some research on something that doesn't have a profit motive behind it? Like, what are the effects of hugs on people with PTSD?

BTC - maybe, crypto though will continue its progress.  This tech is revolutionary.

Hugs = no bad side effects :)

my first couple of months in crypto I was just in ETH and BTC and I was down 30%, knowing how volatile the market is I hodled through that, now I've diversified and I'm about 6x up.
Don't make any decisions in a hurry, do your research and back your decision.

when you ask everyone to shill BTC so their friends invest and, thereby, make you richer (at their expense), I think that it a pretty clear cut case of greed.
Was going to quote OP but, maybe not so strangely, post has been removed.

As BTC value increases, the returns will plateau. BTC may reach  $100K but, I think that may be the end of the party. For a good while at least.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:49:56
Thing is BTC value means a one thousand dollar milestone don't mean so much.  Just to get a fifty percent return, BTC now needs to increase $7k.

laughed on the inside at his comment re: BCH scaling - basically saying, "we'll just use what the BTC devs come up with and it will be better on BCH".  So, BCH has no scaling solution.

I laughed then I realised how inaccurate this post is.  The heading should be "It's getting heavy" as the gentleman only has one bag.  When you think about this further, no longer can we be laughing about the metaphorical "bags" that he is hodling.  However, on the upside, maybe he is a "bag" holder.  Unfortunately though, there is still a problem with this view as he is not actually holding the bag but wearing or carrying it.  This would be a great meme, if only English was so fricken weird!

The vast majority is pretty much gambling - and gambling with minors at that.  So it's pretty damn unethical.  It would be great if we could weed them out of the exchanges.  It is not good to see young people being taken advantage of in this way.
However, some of these projects can quite reasonably be considered investment opportunities.  We are supporting the development of a future technology that will change the way some things are done in this world.

How's it different from BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:28:29
No - bitcoin is, primarily, an exceptional store of value.  Bitcoin will eventually hit a ceiling where it's returns aren't competitive. Can't wait to see what happens after that!

So Mt. Gox won't get hacked again - but any other centralised exchange can.
Decentralised exchanges are the way to go. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:08:55
So not much difference then.
BTC doesn't need great development, it ain't broken. Look at the returns.  Nobody wants to buy coffee with it.

It's good to have a plan, but how do you know BTC will still be around in 10 years.
If the current rate of forking keeps up, BTC may be a shadow of its former self within 2 years.

This is why I'm not hodling bitcoin anymore. 
For those who down vote - I think slow transaction time is a legit reason to stop using BTC.  Healthy discussion of this point is a good thing for its development.

@_date: 2017-11-19 09:31:36
Most exchanges run from a centralised database - just like a bank.
What this means is that, while your coins are on an exchange, all of your private keys for your coins are held by the exchange on their own database.  This means that if their database is hacked, a third party will have your private keys and can easily move your coins into another wallet.
A decentralised exchange works in a similar way to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  A decentralised exchange (known as a DEX) keeps all its data in a distributed ledger that makes it almost impossible to hack.  Therefore it is much more secure and not vulnerable in the way that Mt. Gox and other exchanges are.
To find out more about DEXs:

@_date: 2018-02-09 02:37:24
It's all about market sentiment. Hodlers fortunes are blown around by market sentiment. If news came out tomorrow that a fatal flaw was found in coin X, just watch how the price drops. No matter how hard you hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:28:06
It's actually buying, not hodling that supports price.  There are two types of pressure on price on an exchange, buying and selling - there is no hodl.  If selling pressure is bigger than buying pressure, it doesn't matter how long you hodl, the price will always go down.

I think the energy consumption issue is massive - particularly for mass adoption.  Global warming is the elephant in the room that no one on this reddit wants to talk about (literally did a search on the term and got nothing).
do you know what will happen to energy consumption once the last bitcoin is mined?

Most altcoins are dropping at the moment. This is because people are moving their investment from altcoins to bitcoin.

Great story - totally agree regarding the transaction fees and viability of bitcoin as a currency.

It's actually buyers that do all the heavy lifting to get the price back up. Hodlers do nothing. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:45:49
Bitcoin won't do anything of the kind.  Let's face it, if bitcoin was developed now it would be done completely differently.  There are many coins coming through that have had the opportunity to learn from BTCs mistakes. 
Sure, bitcoin is a big beasty of a thing. But, what with all the infighting and blind devotion to its white paper, it's about as nimble as a whale!
It may take a bit of harpooning, but it will go down.

You need to ask the question - what will happen after the fork?
If it goes like the last one, then you can double your coins, in which case - don't sell until after :)

So, if I've got this right, transactions after a hard fork are vulnerable to having their signatures copied and then used on the alternative blockchain to move coins to another person's account.  Replay protection adds code to the transaction so that this can't happen. Correct?
So the NYA folks don't want to add replay protection because they want to be seen as the operators of the legacy chain?

About a third of the total I have invested is in BTC.  It has given me (by a long way) the best returns that I have got in the short time that I have been investing (about 2 months).
BTC has always been a bit of a crazy ride, from what i can tell.  But, the way I see it.  It's success will be its downfall.  I don't know where the ceiling is, but I can't see this party lasting forever.
