How does one do that
@_date: 2016-04-02 21:22:29
Ive only just gotten to learn about btc but from what I understand, its easier to get caught using btc than usd cash. Since we can see transactions happening, we can notice some fishy ones. Whats your take on that? 
@_date: 2016-04-02 16:55:42
Already there

I need my 3rd comma back
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:52:13
I said "comma"...
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:47:55
I want your money
@_date: 2016-06-14 01:58:26
It doesnt make any sense when buying a car but it does make sense if youre treating it like a stock. A stop loss can help reduce loss and it watches the price at all times, something I cant do
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:26:12
Well Im not really looking to invest just yet. Im very young and Im only starting to learn. I just wanted to see how you used them. How would you recommend I learn about currencies? Any books or videos I should look up?

The moon isnt a planet
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:43:26
Ill look more into it when Im home but thank you for your help. Youll be surprised at how easily ignored people with my knowledge base are ignored here
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:10:36
Do you buy and hold? If so for how long?
@_date: 2016-06-14 01:05:45
Another newb question, can you set any type of stop loss or are you risking everything all the time?
@_date: 2016-06-11 16:13:40
Oh jesus, please hahaha Ive been trying to learn by myself how to trade stocks and bitcoin (mostly stocks to be honest) but you can only get so far this way
@_date: 2016-06-10 20:11:00
Youre the one who will not give the time of day to someone who looks up to you to explain something that is nowhere near common sense. Really doesnt cost you anything
@_date: 2016-06-14 00:31:28
Yeah, you can only start by being invited right?
@_date: 2016-06-10 20:05:59
Oh because everyone here is already a Bitcoin professional and obviously didnt come to this subreddit to learn. Got you
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:47:05
How about a "stop loss" alert? An alert that will let you know when it dropped by that certain percentage but it doesnt sell. Its only an alert. Is there anything like that? I just dont understand how you feel comfortable without one cause it has saved people from a bigger loss
@_date: 2016-06-10 20:19:07
Its not common sense. Youve taken time and effort to learn something, maybe to the point were it's extremely clear for you. I looked at it and tried to make sense of it and Im assuming the other user did too, but Im very new to this world and it is not common sense. Dobt be arrogant, help the community 
@_date: 2016-06-14 00:37:38
I feel like the price will start falling a little the coming week, but do not take my advice. Im speculating as fuck
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:49:40
Can someone explain this to me? I dont own bitcoin but Im interested in learning
@_date: 2016-02-25 19:35:38
Would keeping these in order and verefying their authenticity be the same as mining? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 19:04:49
But hes not italian
@_date: 2016-02-18 19:05:05
New to bitcoin and here to learn. Why would you need an atm if there is no physical representation of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:11:59
I already received varied responses. I dont know where I could find bitcoin users that hate it, but since we werent given too much time for research, I though t a subreddit might be a great place to start. I do appriciate your help, lots of users have taught me something
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:09:52
I mean, I know the group is most likely biased but Ive gotten a variety of responses and I needed to find bitcoin owners. I understand how transactions get put on the blockchain so to prevent double spending and have the p2p system. I understand it is decentralised (although another user told me there is minor centralization). I also know that there is a limit of coins that will be produced. I just know the basics since I never researched about it before and Ive been learning all on my own. Anything you would like to point out to me is welcome. Im hoping to make a great paper
@_date: 2016-02-23 03:46:28
Oh wow. Thats actually really good advice. Thank you!
@_date: 2016-02-22 22:17:01
Can you elaborate? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:50:26
See youre saying something like "we got fax machines there if you need to send a message. Yeah, I get that most of our contact list, like 99%, uses email but we totally fucked up email's monopoly" Bitcoin is as dead as fax machines are. "But it was worth cents two years ago and now its $3-4k!" Oh youre right but it was worth $20k just a couple of months ago. What does that tell us? Bitcoin cant serve as a replacement for fiat yet AND the current users are only using it similar to a stock. "I bought at $500, hope I can sell it at $5k." I get currency fluctuates but lets stop pretending bitcoin is working and/or killing the banking industry
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:51:29
"Bitcoin broke financial monopoly" "yeah but is it bitcoin's fault no one is using it?" My lord, the dissonance 
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:13:25
@_date: 2019-01-21 16:14:55
Sure did. Thats why everyone and their grandma is using bitcoin and not the big banks/traditional currency
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:15:20
Is he though?
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:07:39
Weird flex but okay. Not sure what this even means? Did you all forget bitcoin lost most of its market cap?
@_date: 2019-01-21 16:28:30
Again but in english?
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:26:52
Good for you. 99% of users are exactly the opposite 
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:28:29
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha no.
@_date: 2018-11-22 21:09:22
Theyre just delusional at this point. They fail to realize they turned bitcoin into a trend and it will never be able to hit $20k ever again since no one gives a fuck anymore
@_date: 2016-05-14 23:49:31
Yeah, theyre allowed. The real kick is that no one really teaches them how to use it correctly 
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:32:35
Bitcoin was a dream ruined by the stock market/day traiding phase. It only got to $20000 bc people got greedy and once it came down the greed was over and so was Bitcoin. It was meant to be a currency but all these fucks traded it to death like it was a fucking penny stock
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:34:48
We all know that the average American is doing this. Thank god for bitcoin, am I right?
