sure, as if 99% of this subreddit doesn't see it as an investment, surely they aren't spending the coins

well that's normal here too in Belgium. You get a pretty high unemployment payment monthly so they don't want you to do 'illegal' work, there are some people that do 'zwartwerk' as we call it in Dutch/Flemish. That work without being registered don't pay taxes on it and on the same time still ask for a unemployment payment.

euhm. I have a debit account/savings account and credit card and neither  of those cost me anything at all and never have. Unless I'd go in the red ofcourse.

site stability has been utter shit though

I do a lot of Twitter campagins for my company and Bitcoin can be included under the general 'interest' 'technology. 
So it's possible they specifically targetted Bitcoin but it's also possible they chose broader terms

dunno, i just withdrewn 2000 dollars for 2 days straight no issues. had to refresh a few times though
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:40:19
a question: i g ot all my BTC on kraken, they say they give 1:1 BTC C when it launches.
I'm not losing anything then right? I still get to keep all my bitcoin right?

I don't know how far you are in the process, have you received an e-mail from the lawyer yet? Has your account been cleared to withdraw the money?
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:02:56
do you know if this also possible for Amazon Germany or France/UK?
Being from belgium there's no much point in getting Amazon.com credit
@_date: 2013-08-07 13:09:25

@_date: 2013-07-02 18:52:14

Meh, I'd call it jealousy and stupidity. 
People bought coins because they taught they could make a short term profit, purely by greed.
I bought me 2 coins a year ago, just because I believe in this coin, I won't throw my coins away. How low they may drop, I hope one day to buy something with them on a site such as Amazon.

you only have to keep a copy of your wallet. I don't actively keep Bitcoin-QT updated. Just an offline version backd-up multiple times of my .wallet file
@_date: 2013-07-02 13:57:24
I also have the option to refund bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-06-20 13:14:21
what could they do with this information, pretty much all of the info they ask me could be found excluding my exact adress maybe?
@_date: 2013-06-20 11:04:39
Yep received it this morning.
@_date: 2013-07-02 15:30:51
i deposited money 2 days before bitcoin got shut down. and yes it was the german account
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:43:35
Can someone please explain to me, i transferred money to the account 2 days before it got closed (I don't know if it actually arrived), what will happen to it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:27:58
How are you mining? On your own or in a community?
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:11:33
Twomuch is a scammer i think, I read a couple of posts on this subreddit, he has a ton of alt accounts :
@_date: 2013-07-02 14:45:24
they send it out in batches I believe, it depends on the account your money is on afaik.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:21:16
I'm not skilled in hacking or am not a skilled in deep "tech thingies". But I think this is a great idea to test out your platform!
I wish you all the best!
