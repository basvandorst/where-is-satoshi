Are you new to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-20 15:32:32
You'll likely have some big problems getting an old old client to synch, however.
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:10:33
It is a straight up scam.
Let's talk about why.
1) You didn't invest in Mycelium. You invested in a yet-to-be-developed wallet. It is a separate company. But they did not give you a part of the core product.
2) Contrary to popular belief Mycelium has never made any money. They were hoping to raise at something like a $50 million valuation. But if you look at Mycelium's history they have made less than $100,000 total in their years of existence. Being a wallet makes making money very difficult. You gave them money because they wanted to cash in and de-risk themselves from a corporate entity that makes 0 money. In exchange, you got a non-existent wallet in a child company of a company that has never made a profit. Their valuation was a completely made up valuation, because they have no actual ability to assess their value. While I respect their wallet, the idea that an open source piece of software has a valuation of the sort they were claiming in spite of the evidence that they have no idea how to monetize the software, they arbitrarily decided that they were going to go after an egregious valuation with no justification.
3) They went public in a way that they believe eschews the need for government oversight. The truth is, all they've done is incurred liabilities because they have broken the law in many jurisdictions (likely) including their own.
4) Since Mycelium has no money, and you have given to a raise of a company that is distinct from the parent company, you have no way of getting your money back. They will use that money to pay for development - likely of the old wallet. But they certainly won't have enough money to defend their actions in court, which means you will have 0 hope of getting your money back by suing.
5) They are obviously mixing funds. You invested in a child company. They are going to (I'm certain) use that money to develop software for the parent company. They will do it justifiably by saying the developers in the new company are hired by Mycelium, and that Mycelium development is crucial for the development of the new wallet.
6) Vitiated and uncompensated attention. Which wallet do you think they are incentivized to promote? The one that they own or the one that they do not own? If you give money outside of the regulatory infrastructure, you're going to have a difficult time preventing things like fund mixing. They aren't being paid to promote the new wallet. So they are going to give its development less attention, and they are going to promote the old wallet not the new one because that is the one that they wanted to de-risk themselves, has cap ex costs, etc.

I believe this would be bargaining. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 02:12:18
Nope. It's not a theory. Scammers rarely know they are scamming.
@_date: 2016-08-21 01:07:59
That's good to know. I haven't booted up an old client recently. But it was my impression that old clients would have trouble keeping up with current tx volume.
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:22:32
Ok. So you know as well as I do that there were tons of people offering these returns in the early days. Now you're right to be wary. Those returns are ultimately impossible. But 16 year olds don't know that. It is conceivable to me that trendon and others had found a wormhole that they filled and had no experience in the space. Waking up and running a ponzi suddenly is something we see happen all the time.

@_date: 2016-08-21 23:56:01
Bitcoin has never been unregulated. If it were, Trendon wouldn't be going to jail for violating regulations.
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:49:19
1) No you didn't Rassah. You guys sold a derivative wallet, not the Mycelium wallet. And to say that now you are giving your investors a part of the overall company is either disingenuous or a complete derivation from what was actually sold in the crowdfund.
2) I think you misunderstand hyperbole. A company that has made $100,000 after 4 years of existence has made no money. Also, w/ salaries and expenses, my statement is 100% true. You have revenued a total of $100,000 or less after 4 years. You have made no profits. In fact, you have revenued an average of $25,000 per year, which isn't even a single salary. I get the idea that you have no idea how to monetize the software because you have never been able to monetize it - neither has any other wallet. So let's not pretend like you have any kind of special knowledge here. The fact that you don't understand that making less than $100k after 4 years is no money should indicate the level of complex business knowledge you guys have gone into this with.
3) I don't care. You can eschew whatever you want. But when the government shows up at your door, don't expect a lot of sympathies from them for your public flouting of the law. I don't really care either way. But a wallet, of all things, probably doesn't want that in their risk profile, and it should severely limit your ability to raise... unless you raise from dumb money.
4) No you don't. If that were true, you wouldn't have needed to raise. Also, let's examine the claim here. You are de-risking yourself because you have spent 4 years developing this wallet with your own money. That's all good and well. So you have taken on 100% of the concept risk of this business. Now, after 4 years, you are about to turn a corner and become profitable through an app store. You also have a lot more money that you could draw from. You don't want to draw from this money because despite taking on 100% of the concept risk for 4 years and being sure that you are about to turn a corner and become profitable, you have decided that you want to share that profitability with the public. So you did it at a 50ish million dollar valuation. Was this charity? Or... was it as you say here, an evaluation of the risk, and you have no idea if this will be profitable? Because if it is as you say, then you are only doing this to de-risk yourself at a valuation far above the actual value of your company. This is the equivalent of buying a $25,000 home by getting your friends to give you $5 million for a 10% ownership stake in the $25,000 home.
5) "On top of" is not honest. You are releasing a different wallet of a different name built on the same stack as Mycelium. The new wallet has no name recognition, no funds to speak of, is held in a corporate entity that is distinct from Mycelium, and it is what was purchased in the Mycelium crowd fund. So you didn't even give people the house you built. You are building a new one on a different lot. Again, you are having your cake and eating it too. So now the new wallet is a "subsidiary?" I thought you said that it was this new wallet and the old wallet are one and the same company. Are they? Or is the new company a subsidiary with no profit sharing in mycelium except for what is saved as a result of resource pooling?
6) This is false. You are contradicting yourself here. You aren't killing Mycelium. You are building a new wallet on the old stack with the same team of developers. One wallet, Mycelium, you own all of. One wallet, you have sold a substantial amount of equity in. You have done it in such a way that will not prevent fund mixing, and lets you fund development of the old wallet under the auspices that you are pooling resources for the purpose of saving costs.

:) Every stat people are touting is a desperate attempt to prove this is working. 17k total nodes? 700 online? We don't measure Bitcoin nodes that way. You measure them by online nodes. That means that 700 nodes is what OB has. Otherwise we'd talk about Bitcoin being a multi-million node cryptocurrency. Also, I'm skeptical of even that number since so many products don't load up when you click on them which tells me that there are a lot of people booting up to test it, and listing items to test them... but then not doing anything with their node.

How can you say that when no one is using any of the meta coin platforms yet?
@_date: 2016-04-25 14:10:21
This is such a dumb post ThePiachu. Generally, I have considered your commentary well thought out, but this misses the point of your debate entirely. You are correct that no one "needs" these platforms. But you have applied no thoughtfulness to the discussion whatever. How did the world turn before Bitcoin? How did drug dealers and prostitutes deal with clients or their bosses? The answer is that cash provides many of the efficiencies of Bitcoin. Bitcoin, however, ushered in a new era of efficiency for certain things - moving cash across borders for example. As a result, those participating in that new paradigm "need Bitcoin." Moreover, when Visa, Mastercard, and AMEX pulled their services from Backpages, in the past, that business would have been effectively shut down. This new world allows them to continue to survive. You can choose to be as literal about that commentary as you want. But as it stands, people need Bitcoin. It is not simply used because it is cool.
To whether people "need" counterparty, your point is entirely that the functionalities provided by counterparty are very very useful - but there are other platforms that also provide those functionality. That's true. You fail to recognize any of the shortcomings of all the platforms and even say that colored coins is further along in development. I don't think that's true, but even if it is, I don't think Chris or I have ever criticized colored coins. It is a viable alternative to Counterparty, though it is definitely limited by Bitcoin. Colored coins lose their color, for example, if the UTXOs do not move from color enabled wallet to color enabled wallet. Counterparty, on the other hand, deals with accounts, letting users send Counterparty assets to and from Bitcoin wallets encoding themselves in the blockchain by riding on the back of transactions. Very simply, it is a more useful way of encoding data into the blockchain than Colored Coins. That said, that could change. But it's very clear that the functionality of meta coins are very very useful. Use = need. If they provide efficiencies (settlement in video games, tether, etc) then.
The other point, that I think you glossed over is that Bitcoin is paid for by subsidies by the federal government. So that means that the price of Bitcoin reflects the premium on fungible value. The less useful currently fungible vehicle like cash become, the more people "need" Bitcoin. As that premium increases, so too does the price of Bitcoin, along with the hash rate which is securing the chain. What that means is you have a chain whose security is based on the need for fungible value, and you are comparing it to a chain whose entire utility is premised on the notion that people need smart contracts. That's a fine point, but for the fact that you nor anyone can identify who needs these things or, for that matter, what some examples of useful smart contracts are that aren't ridiculously convoluted. You are absolutely right in saying that people might use them because it's cool, but you have to admit that the fundamental truth about blockchains is that they rely on capital inflows for their security. That means that there needs to be someone who "needs" what this provides, in order for the block chain to support the weight of it's data.
This, might even be a better vehicle by which Counterparty could be criticized. To say that it adds chain weight and is likely unconsidered in miner's securing of the chain, is an entirely legitimate criticism. If that is true, then were a Counterparty asset to gain real value, it might be the kind of thing that incentivizes an attack on the network. But that isn't your criticism.
Ultimately, people can build projects because they can, or they feel like it, or they want to, but at the end of the day, someone is going to have to demonstrate a "need" for that project. I built a lot of things when I was a kid. I databased all my baseball cards, I spent hours cataloguing my music, I had literal pissing contests. But those were fun, and their effects on others were negligible and transcient. What do you do when your blockchain is gigabytes large, requires its users to store in active memory, data that may or may not be useful, and whose entire proposition is to build a blockchain that is not secured by its fungible token, and rather, whose incentive is entirely based on the utility of smart contracts.
It seems to me, you mistook Chris's criticisms of Ethereum as an endorsement of Counterparty. When in reality, we have never pumped Counterparty insofar as saying we think the tech is really cool. We have said numerous times XCP is a dubious proposition since people might not (again with the word) "need" it. Moreover, the smart contracts that will be added to the platform are going to be every bit as useful as Ethereum. Again, in spite of that truth, the same question needs to be answered. Who needs this shit? Sure, it will be on Bitcoin so the security part is solved, but that doesn't instantly mean people need it. The beauty of Counterparty is that because it's on Bitcoin, your criticism of it doesn't matter because it free-rides on the back of the network. Ethereum, on the other hand is 15GBs and growing and begging for someone to find some utility. Bitcoin's utility was obvious from the outset... Ethereum's utility is not. Counterparty's utility might not be obvious, but since it is on the Bitcoin network, it could languish for 10 years before finding an use whereas Ethereum doesn't have that luxury. When you have no utility and all you have are users playing with it because it's cool, you have a price that is driven by nothing more than rampant speculation. Bitcoin definitely has it's speculators (as does XCP), but there is real utility there as well. Ethereum... not so much.

Because Bitcoiners are rarely concerned with the quality of an idea and are more concerned with being high fived by their sixteen year old compadres. Right now OB is popular among bitcoiners. Thats not a very big group. Apart from that, they aren't comparable projects. OB is a decentralized network that is poorly designed for centralized ecommerce. DZ is a decentralized market that leverages bitcoin's property of censorship resistance. Unlike OB, we have no overhead associated with the network part.  What that means very simply is that the only people who will ever use OB are ideologically motivated mental midgets. I'm ok with that. This experiment will let me get a pretty good idea of how many of those there are. But you should consider whether you came to bitcoin for its unique censorship resistant, immutable  properties or if you came to fight amazon.

@_date: 2015-12-15 20:34:16
Well, let's talk about what censorship we're worried about. If you are afraid that a Theymos-type is waiting in the wings to tell you that you can or can't list a product, then yes, this system is censorship free. If the censorship freeness, however, is an acknowledgement of regulatory routing and a grizzly-like solidity in the face of guns and laws, then you have a system that is every bit as censorable as the internet. Now, the internet isn't that censorable - look at pirate bay. But Pirate Bay has to obfuscate their server locations, change IPs, move their stuff around, and the owners of the site go into hiding from time to time. They suffer from shutdowns, copyright claims, and more. They are pretty sophisticated and have done a massively good job of staying up in spite of themselves. So how is that different than OB? If the government wants to shut down OB, it would serve the host where the store is located, it would take your data, and it would locate you since there is no obfuscation of IPs. You could obfuscate your identity in the same way that Pirate Bay does. But you have absolutely no more solidity in this network than you do as a website. Every single site is a single point of failure.
@_date: 2015-12-15 19:53:41
No, it's not. The OB network is P2P, the stores are self-hosted. Just like how http is distributed and websites are not. It's the same model.

Well i certainly dont believe in oracles. Dns was definitely a suggestion of satoshis as was storing it on a different chain. Then namecoin has been a bit of a failure. So... what do you say about that? The assumption that you can spool up another blockchain no problem is wrong. It is predicated on a belief that the universe owes you a working chain; it doesn't. As to whether I run a node... i mean, you dont know that. But if the economic incentives are such that running a node isn't being done by me, then consider the incentives of running a node for 11 different blockchains. Satoshi wasn't an idiot. But thinking that his uninformed-by-history equivocations are something you need to agree with because he said them is... idiotic.
If your data isn't going onto the bitcoin blockchain, I suspect the data will see no efficiencies being stored on a blockchain over a traditional database.

No one said you're building a drug marketplace. But it is certainly not a permissionless marketplace, which is the marker of something decentralized.


You guys are the ones insisting on the discussion turning toward drugs. But you seem to be impossibly unwilling to understand why your system is nonsensical.


Well, you've never made this point. But it's a stupid point nonetheless. The point I've made is that there is no difference between OB and the internet, and that if you scale, your entire infrastructure will exactly mirror the internet with a suite of stores and marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon. But it won't do that because it is just a bad version of the internet. You are blinded by your anger for my criticism. Ebay and Etsy are perfectly fine. I can get to them in chrome, and they work well. They are websites. Just like a store in Open Bazaar. The fact that you can't understand the project you're supposed to be the expert in and I do is definitely a testament to my intellect. I strive to be the dumbest person around here, but you have outstupided me.


No it's not. An OB store that hosts lots of people's product is a OB version of Etsy or Ebay. OB is a p2p version of http which is already a distributed/decentralized system. If you don't understand why Ebay is making you pay for access to the network they have built, then you will be very confused when your project fails. If any store achieved scale in OB, I guarantee, they would charge people to sell on that site, because... it costs money to both maintain network and build it in the first place. And since those stores will be owned by their respective owners, those products will again, be censored by the store owner. You have literally constructed a thing that looks and works exactly like http. It's hilarious.

Lol. Asking someone a question isn't being a jerk. But it's nice to know where you stand.

@_date: 2015-12-17 19:54:29
Oh... so the current system is already decentralized? News to me. I think you're describing middlemen, which ob promises to delete.
@_date: 2015-12-22 00:03:17
I would probably say yes. I'm not a programmer. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 04:58:08
It's not semantics Nick. But you made a pretty unequivocal statement about what censorship is, and it's pretty much a description of your actions. So you can skirt around it all you want. I just appreciate you gave us a glimpse into your personal feelings on the matter, considering this all started with you guys claiming that censorship was the opposite of your platform.
@_date: 2015-12-23 18:44:26
The assertion that Satoshi designed Bitcoin to be extended as such? What evidence do you need? If you want to assess that, go learn to program Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-12-01 16:04:02
Yes, that is in fact censorship. It's pretty scummy btw to post deleted posts while not leaving them in the original discussion for context. On their own, however, these posts are hilarious.
@_date: 2015-12-13 01:09:58
We haven't said that OpenBazaar is a business Chris. We've said that OpenBazaar is a stupid idea. And when we've explained why, your team has lied about how the protocol works.

@_date: 2015-12-01 17:52:46
Oh man, so true. I never bothered to look. Quick everyone, before u/cryptonaut420 whitewashes.
This is my favorite:  which can be read here: 
I like this bit most: "You know what IS censorship? Deleting posts so that no one can read them. There isn't really much more to it than that, it's a simple definition.... Want to know what one of the big differences between and the XT sub is? On XT, we frequently have certain mods and other aggressive members coming over constantly throwing insults, or even just saying a bunch of stuff which most people there obviously don't agree with. Their posts are not deleted, and they are not even banned (AFAIK). Instead they are just downvoted and people provide their counter arguments or w/e... now on the other hand, no problem just banning people left and right, constantly deleting posts etc. all based on some rules they made up on the spot and apply selectively (read: that "trolls on notice" sticky thread that seems to have conveniently been taken down, or the other thread earlier where theymos announced discussion of XT is banned)."
u/cryptonaut420 has just shown the world his butt.
@_date: 2015-12-02 05:09:17
Lol, u/tmornini is trying to Satoshi u/brighton36. But tmornini is the idiot! I love it (I'm doing the play-by-play).
So the question is where is the censorship in storing hashes? You are evading the original question.
@_date: 2015-12-11 07:05:29
Hoffman is building Open Bazaar which I've been highly critical of. So he's just butt hurt. I wouldn't take anything he says too seriously. He's just a troll.

@_date: 2015-12-18 19:24:13
I fully understand them. :) I am an e-commerce marketer. So... I am incredibly aware of how these systems work and how one can make money in each of the ecosystems. As to a common reputation system, what are those little stars that are next to each of the store profiles in google? What would you call that?
@_date: 2015-12-13 16:09:17
Lol, the only reason I do this Brian, is because after your project fails, people will want to know why, and I will have explained it at every stage. Everyone will be surprised by the downfall of OB except me, because I gave you great critiques, and you didn't bother to listen to even one. Instead you folded your arms and called me a meanie. Also, you didn't address the fact that you just straight-up lied.
@_date: 2015-12-15 21:07:59
Lol, maybe they don't understand how to build a decentralized market.

@_date: 2015-12-16 14:22:32
So.. what's the difference?
@_date: 2015-12-21 01:19:53
Not a good idea. Don't do it. This is the first idea of every single Bitcoiner I'm willing to bet that you probably got here about 5 months ago (despite your claim). You won't make money, and it will fail. I hope you didn't quit your job to do this.
@_date: 2015-12-11 07:09:49
Lol, Brian Hoffman is nothing but a bully. He likes watching those who are unable to defend themselves get smeared on the internet and is unconcerned with truth. He regularly misrepresents the nature of his project OpenBazaar in an effort to trick the Bitcoin community into supporting it which is unfortunate because it's just a shittier version of Shopify. I wish him luck in all of his endeavors, but would hope that he gains a little humility and begins listening to those who know more than him. I'm not sure what he's contributed to the community, though whatever it is, I'm sure it was more than me.
@_date: 2015-12-22 20:59:31
It's not sarcasm Paul. You did. If you didn't, you would correct the record as publicly as it was reported and then re-reported by the Economist, the Bank of England, Financial Times, and every journal in the Bitcoin space.

I'm of the opinion that you probably shouldn't decide what the topic of a given forum conversation is about considering that the initial topic has very little to do with wher ethe ensuing conversation goes. But that is your prerogative. I don't have beef with Adam. He has beef with me and Chris. I enjoy the beef. It adds a lot of fun drama. But you should recognize what direction this is going in.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:10:27
Fine, why don't you explain it to me since you seem to have bought the propaganda rather than using your brain.

@_date: 2015-12-20 19:49:30
Correct. A nodejs implementation is being built.
@_date: 2015-12-17 19:19:42
No you're wrong. it isn't any different than the internet. The protocol might be distributed, but the stores themselves are completely centralized - exactly as a website is on the decentralized http-based internet.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:37:31
Don't mind Bruce. He's just a troll.
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:07:34
I wish I could take credit. I don't know code from a hole in my butt. I'm just doing what I can to start building a community around this with u/eragmus who's taken on the subreddit.
@_date: 2015-12-17 04:52:14
:) Lol. That account isn't me u/frankenmint. Neither is u/obesejunseth. People are making accounts because they don't like me. It's a real honor to be disliked enough for them to go about doing that.
People say they want a subreddit free from moderation. So now they can't complain. They can go to bitcoinarchy and get it. I don't actually think that's what they want.
EDIT: I didn't click your link before answering and had assumed you linked to r/bitcoinarchy.
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:24:20
There are two camps here. The stupid camp thinks that we're here because of some big technological innovation. Bitcoin works because of tech, certainly. But the innovation in bitcoin is the economic system. It is the economics that keep the chain safe, and it is the economics that keep this thing running. In the case of Bitcoin, there is no pretense of value. No one said, Bitcoin will just keep some kind of value and therefore it will keep this chain going. The proposal was, here is a scarce asset with no value. If the market finds this valuable, let's see if it can make this machine move forward. So far it seems to be working. One cannot simply declare that goal and see it come to fruition, however. The economics of this system are inordinately complex. And it's the playground of arrogant children to pretend like they understand it at all.

Lol, I haven't mentioned my project. But now that you bring it up, you can follow the project that actually is a decentralized store here: 
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:27:00
Drop Zone is a market built directly on the Blockchain.  No GUI right now, just a command line client. But it's working, and we just did a transaction on it. It's what a real decentralized market looks like.
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:36:53
It's not that they are the only ones who can have an opinion. It's that subject matter experts are the only ones whose opinions should matter. So why would a core dev spend his time explaining to the masses of r/bitcoin whose opinion is largely retarded the finer points of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-12-17 01:05:48
r/bitcoinarchy is the answer!
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:44:04
You say that, so if things are so obvious to you, let's do it. Tell me what it is that I do not understand.

@_date: 2015-12-21 15:04:53
I believe that would be correct. The goal is to make as much of this prunable as possible. For now, there has to be a balance struck between what miners will mine and what is being submitted. 'Til recently, miners were regularly ignoring OP_RETURN. That said, this will very likely require that users pay a bit more for DZ transactions. They have deliberately been made very identifiable so that they can be discriminated against.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:14:04
This wasn't a panel full of randos. It was some of the biggest names in Bitcoin and then Craig.
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:43:35
That's not true at all. Your IP is broadcast, and each store is just like a website. So in exactly the same way that Piratebay moves its servers around, uses different URLs, etc, you could obfuscate in that way. But for the most part, people are going to be hosting this on traditional servers. People will be hosting this on their home computer (which makes their home computer a server as well). And then, all a government has to do to take a store down is serve a subpoena. But you knew that... right?
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:30:21
So now that Craig has been outed as lying about his credentials, would you like to revise your statement?
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:17:12

@_date: 2015-12-17 18:28:18
The whitepaper talks about it. When this paper came out, it changed the way I think about Sybil attacks. Like the internet has no restrictions on content, a market really shouldn't handle the sybil attacks other than to impose the small cost of creating identities. In the early days of the web, we dealt with SPAM by using webrings and trusted content repositories. Now, Google sorts through the SPAM and delivers us the content we want. If DZ works, that is probably the solution to Sybil attacks. I imagine it would start off with people linking to vendors they know and trust, and grow from there to some sort of search.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:17:04
That I agree with.
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:38:28
Haha. It's a decentralized marketplace. It's like Open Bazaar but built on the blockchain in a way that actually makes it censorship resistant.

Lol, Sam, do you see that there is no difference between "the item is in the crevice of a tree" and "the item is in your mailbox?"
I think you need to open your mind and learn to iterate. Anything the OB protocol claims to do, DZ does better. And in DZ, the local search is anonymizing, which... I bet it's not in OB. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 04:17:36
1. Yes. Big lies.
2. Nothing has been proven. But Paul has definitely been shown to lie a lot.
3. Hmm... no, that was u/brighton36. But yes, I did open a new one some days later. And yes, Adam Levine censors. You can know he does because if you go to the general forum, he has shadowbanned that article.
4. Haha. I might be a sockpuppet of Chris'. I wouldn't know. I can't see his hand, it's too far up my ass
5. His questions were stupid. And we answered them all.
6. Yes Chris said that.
7. Yes. And I stand by that. I have been trying for years to give up my credibility and prove that I am a moron. Thank you for furthering my cause here.
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:12:32
The owner of the store that sells those things can be censored. Their server can be shut off. And if they opt for external hosting, that host can be subpoenaed. So, just like how you could build a store on your own domain that would sell those things uncensored, the gov could stop it right away.
@_date: 2015-12-01 16:12:53
They weren't off topic. They were in exactly the vein of insipidness that Adam had posted previously. They were exactly on topic.

@_date: 2015-12-26 16:15:18
God, the stupid conveyed here is amazing.
Ebay = Open Bazaar
Open Bazaar will not work. It provides no efficiency over the incumbent systems. It has no anonymity, it isn't censorship resistant.
Facebook = Synereo
There is no way that the four or five devs on the Synereo project will replace Facebook. Moreover, that project, if you didn't already figure it out, exists for nothing more than the crowdsale.
WhatsApp = Signal Messenger
At least this isn't a blockchain app. Hilariously, this is the one thing that actually has been built and works on chain. You should look at the chat portion of Drop Zone's protocol. It chats over testnet
This is already decentralized. Uber provides a central service for the decentralization of taxis. They are an insurer more than they are a centralized cab company. If you are a taxi driver, and you get caught by the local officials, and fined, they pay it for you. Bitcoiners are obsessed with this one, but they don't know what Uber is.
Again, it is a platform that decentralizes hotels. Tell me again what you would do differently here?
@_date: 2015-12-17 19:18:39
Good points u/catsfive.
@_date: 2015-12-11 14:25:13
That was a huge critique of mine. The point isn't to be online if you're not around .The point is to not be able to be taken down when it's up. That said, you still have no way of persisting reputation events. :) And because you have no blockchain, you never will. So ya'll should probably consider writing reputation events into the chain.
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:26:24
I agree, he's not. But the point is nevertheless correct. It becomes difficult to give identity-less people awards, even if they deserve them given the rules that exist for these awards.

But how do you know it exists?
@_date: 2015-12-18 05:40:50
I am amazed at how many times I have to answer this question. You are analogizing the starting of a website on the internet. Your statement is akin to "The internet doesn't charge you 15% fees to start a website."
@_date: 2015-12-17 02:32:42
Oh yeah! That's the kind of forum I would love to run! Sounds like you're looking for censorship of a certain kind. You should probably stay here. :)
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:56:59
I told you what it means. The network of OB is decentralized. Just like the internet. The stores are stored locally.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:01:52
Bruce, you are the conversation rail giver. You show up on every post i make like that one about getting Josh Garza to not speak at BTC Miami. You summarily dismissed the accusations and asked for more evidence but begged that he keep his speaking spot. Oh not to mention that you keep inviting yourself to secret meetings that you advertise as secret on islands that you put on that are for people that have contributed to BTC (which you haven't). You aren't exactly a credible person.
@_date: 2015-12-15 21:43:58
I just told you that ebay and etsy are excellent. They are honey pots of network effect.


Is that a fact? Have you ever run an ecommerce store, or are you making uncitable claims that are irrelevant?


Thank you.
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:10:53
I saw that. But I wouldn't be satisfied by "Bitcoin Belle just knew him." He was a unknown, then suddenly appeared next to people we have all heard of and know well. So how did that end up happening, and I can't imagine its timing wasn't a coincidence.
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:36:19
Well, u/stormsbrewing is right. It is a protocol. But it's not any better than http which is also a distributed protocol and which also lets you have an self-hosted store. So... all OB is, is a non-web version of something like http, but instead of letting you host any kind of content you want, it is limited to only stores, and it's inaccessible to internet browsers. So, it's just a shitty version of Shopify or Magento.
@_date: 2015-12-02 21:58:53

Bitcoin is far more decentralized than the internet. You could take down nearly all the node operators, and your access to Bitcoin and its entire transaction history would be completely uncompromised. Moreover, you could simply connect to a peer and get that entire transaction history yourself if you were worried about it being shut down. In OB, if an user's "store" is shut down, the content can no longer be accessed. This is trivially censorable.
Seriously guys, we spent years talking about how the efficiency of Bitcoin is that it is not censorable. Censorable by whom? Did you think we were saying it isn't censorable by Theymos? Or did you think that we were saying it isn't censorable by the government. Because if it's trivially censored by governments, it's censorable. And that is what OB is.


Every store on the OB network persists in one location. It is on your node. That is it. So if it were for drugs, all that would mean is that every store owner is another Ross Ulbricht. The risk of being the marketplace owner is lifetime in prison. If you want to gain from network effect, you will find, very soon, that people will start to make destination stores on OB - much like Amazon. I'm telling you, OB will never get big enough to see that, but it's absurd that you would think that the great invention here is that everyone can keep running their own store. It will very quickly, if it gets any scale, start to look just like the web. Lots of individual stores, a few megastores like Amazon. Good luck. And just like Amazon, if the government wanted to shut it down, it could.
You need to realize that OB is distributed like the internet. But the stores themselves are not distributed. So what you have is a distributed network (like http) that connects to individual stores (like websites). OB is programmed in UDP, not I2P. It is not able to be put behind tor with ease or speed.
Finally, centralization is not "superior to centralized models" except in cases where the externality you are dealing with is burdensome regulation. This means that these stores will only find efficiency if they are selling goods that you couldn't otherwise buy through centralized means easily. So... my guess is that New Hampshirites will start to buy all their Raw Milk on OB. But that will probably be the only use case that it ever sees.

Ok, so let's work on this. So it's like Bitocoin in that it connects to a p2p network. Excellent. So to what end? Does that p2p network do anything but route the traffic that queries for you to you? Because if that is what it does, all you've done is something like a distributed namespace. That sounds awful similar to DNS. And if it's like a website in that you can install it on your computer or host it in the cloud... that sounds an awful lot like... a website... on the internet routed to via DNS. So... I get what you're saying. But the truth is that nothing has changed here.

I think it's pretty clear. You're asserting that a good use of the blockchain is to write checksums into it. That's pure stupidity. The notion that checksums are something that suffers from censorship is nonsensical. Maybe there are like 2 examples. But I'd be hard pressed to believe there are even that many. The blockchain is an instrument of regulatory arbitrage. It works in spaces subject to high degrees of censorship and oversight. Checksums are not anywhere on that spectrum.

Interesting. So this can easily be decided by using IRL definitions. 
Hmm... well... if we give OP the benefit of the doubt, assuming that he knew what ethos meant, and that his definition doesn't deter much from what it says on Wikipedia... then I suppose what he is accusing Tim of is changing the patina of the discussion. He's trying to direct the conversation in a way that is a different direction than is it is currently trending through the spread of information that (many of us believe) is accidentally disingenuous at best and a straight up lie at worst. So now that we've clarified the definition of the word and my rose colored understanding of the OP's original use of it, let's get back to having a conversation. Did you have something to say or do you just complain about words people used correctly so you don't need to be held responsible for ignoring their point?

You're not correct here. The internet is to a website or amazon as open bazaar is to a single store or a store that lets multiple people list on it. I'm nto going to say much about this, because you're wrong, and it's obvious to anyone who has half a brain and reads what you wrote.
But I will say this, you didn't come to Bitcoin to remove the 15% from Ebay. You will find very soon that Ebay earns that 15% and that the features of OB will necessarily suck because they don't have the money to build a good, competitive product. You will also learn that the internet has 0 fee to join, and that the crux of your argument is that it will be easier to sell things on OB because no one will ever use it. You don't know that's what your argument is, but you will soon.

That's not greed. Bounties are clearly a donation by the company wherein they are discovered. The problem is that the opportunity cost for hackers overall needs to somewhat matched by the proposed bounty. When I say opportunity cost, I mean, also to include the chance that one might be caught and put in jail, etc. For you to believe that your coins are safe in a place like CB, their payouts for exploit finds such as this, must match or exceed the opportunity to exploit. I don't know where $5k is on that spectrum, but it should unsettle you that the guy who found the exploit finds it to be too low since he could have exploited it.

Again, when you're 30, and you look back, you will see it and be embarrassed. I look forward to that day. Wunderkinds get humbled when they realize they were protected from criticism by their age and the rampart of yes-men that gather in their midsts. The difference is very simple. One of those is telling people things. The other is sitting and listening to what people say and then writing articles based on your own progression through the thinking. One of these starts with a conclusion and finds a premise that matches it, the other starts with a NULL premise and explores it until either a conclusion is reached or the learning is so expansive that the conclusion is forever undefined. One of these is science, the other is what Tim Swanson and you do.

Haha, we rarely pump drop zone. DZ just happens to be what you claimed to have built. But yeah, I would say that the project is obviously stupid, and r/bitcoin has a unhealthy obsession with it. So I'm trying to explain why that obsession makes no sense after trying for months to understand what makes your project any different than hosting a website. That said, it is obvious. I show up to set the record straight since you guys are completely equivocal about the project's limitations. You haven't taken a shit on drop zone threads because you don't understand it. You have no critiques. That said, unlike OB, the day you do have good questions, I'll happily answer them because I understand how DZ works which will preclude me from making statements about it that are false: 
By the way, that's your fearless leader taking a shit on one of my posts that has nothing to do with either DZ or OB. Lookie there, you aren't only going after the better project, you're leveling personal attacks at me. So... I guess that makes you the bigger ass holes.

@_date: 2015-12-15 20:01:51
You're right. Decentralized doesn't mean anonymous., which is why I listed it in addition to something the OB is not. As far as what it means to be decentralized, I would say that it probably means that when one node in the network is taken out it does not impact the rest of the network in a way that matters. So in the case of Bitcoin, you can take out any node operator, or even 90% of the node operators and the state of the network will not change. Not only that, I would say that it is a question of content solidity. In the case of Bitcoin, the content remains. In the case of OB, if you remove a store through DDOS, the content is no longer accessible. OB simply makes every single person who hosts their own store responsible for the content they are selling. It is no different than just using the internet. And if its efficiency really is in Dark Markets, this does nothing to stop dark market exits (because each store is still owned by individuals and if a dark market scaled at all, they would simply be like the Amazon of dark markets on OB), it does nothing to give anonymity to dnms, and it does nothing for retailers as far as risk mitigation. In fact, a simple website over Tor is probably better for DNMs. And if that's the case then who is OB good for? The answer is that it's not actually better than the existing infrastructure for anybody.

So this is pretty darn complex. Is the internet a server that acts as a single point for the entire system? Like is there a giant shutoff button in the mountains of Colorado? I'm sorry for the ignorance, just trying to figure out what makes this different than the internet nad hosting a website.


Oh, so it's like the http standard? And OB is just like... loading Magento onto an apache install? That makes sense. Ok, what else? Don't go too fast for me, I'm an idiot.


Ok... so sort of like the internet? If this is true, why are there so few people in your community contributing code now? Seems like a majority of ya'll are spectators.


Right... sorry, just trying to keep up. So... if they are running their own store on their own computer, then isn't that a little like running your own website on your computer? Wait a second, what happens if your store gets used a lot? Where will you host it? Because I think that a lot of people accessing your store would gum it up... I guess if I were going to have a well-used store, I'd put it on an instance of Amazon. But that seems like it's getting to close to looking like a website now... I guess I'd just buy a faster computer and I'd pay like an extra couple thousand bucks to purchase like a huge amount of bandwidth into my home. Hope no one DOSes me since the data line probably is too small for someone to even try to distribute it. But I'm sure you have thought of fixes to that since I'm the idiot.


Ok, this is interesting. I was under the impression that the entirety of OB would be shut down if even one store was raided. I guess that's not true. So, OB operates almost exactly like the internet right? Like if I'm selling pills from Canada in my store, and the police raid my home to shut down my website, the whole internet doesn't go down, just my site. Do I have that right? So, not to be too prideful, I'm not certain, so you'll have to clarify, but if someone raids a node operator, is the information in the Bitcoin network affected? Or does all the information stay on all the nodes? Because what you just described feels a lot like the internet and a lot less like a decentralized system. But I wouldn't know. I'm retarded. Please explain.


This is a good point. So, I get the sense that you're under the impression that this works with Tor. that would be pretty neat if it did. But since it's written on UDP, I believe it doesn't. But I'm the idiot, so you should probably double check for me.  let me make it easy for you to double check.


Interesting. Too bad the system nakedly broadcasts your IP... at least that's what I've heard.


Whew, I thought it was using something like VISA that a lot of people use. Ok, so it's good to hear that they will be using Bitcoin. So can you quickly explain why this is any different than setting up Shopify (which also takes Bitcoin), and if your answer is that it takes bitpay or coinbase, then can you explain why this is any different than setting up Magento and adding any Bitcoin address you want to the system?

That is not the case But it's humorous. Every ebay seller can, in addition, have an online store. No one is barring them from doing that. The notion that OB is the Ebay part is fucktarded. OB is the internet part, the stores are the ebay part. If the ecosystem got to any sizable quantity of users, you would see stores that are like Ebay (they charge for access to their network) and stores that are like an individual site store. You miss that this is EXACTLY analogous to the internet.

Stores are hosted on censorable computers. The instant you have any volume, you will need to use something like cloud hosting to load your store.
@_date: 2015-12-18 01:18:21
Lol. The criticism isn't that it has nothing to offer. It's that it has to offer exactly the same thing as the internet.
Let me spell it out for you, if you care to read:
In any decentralized system, you need to understand what it is that needs to be decentralized in order to be revolutionary. The innovation of Bitcoin was to decentralize the ledger itself. The reason? The risk of exchange is in double spends. So you prevent double spends by allowing the network to come to consensus and then solidifying that consensus through burning energy and signing off on that energy. This allows the creation of non-replicable assets on the internet that can be controlled by a single person (address), something previously considered impossible. The fact that this asset is non-duplicable is why it can have value (consider that email messages aren't able to be sold, but bitcoin messages can be). The message itself, which allocates which address has what coins. This feature also means that governments can't stop it because the creation of money is something that is done in hundreds of countries, by hundreds of people.
In a market, there are a number of risks that are present. The first risk is in selling goods. If you're selling goods that are gray or black market, then you are at risk of being shut down, arrested, charged with crimes for the sale of goods. Open Bazaar doesn't solve that problem. So then there is the other problem, the problem of actually owning the market itself. Seeing a market that solved this problem would be a real treat as hosting a market has with it the most incredible risks (see Ross Ulbricht). Amazon has to do an awful lot of moderation as does Ebay to make sure they are compliant. A market owner would be someone who owns and controls the market itself.
So I am assuming you think that OB is decentralizing the market. But you would be wrong. In fact, if you open a store on OB, you have opened your own market. So consider in the future, you own a market that gets some traction, a lot of people flock to your market. So you start thinking, "I could scale the fuck out of this thing." Because you have figured out a good hosting solution, and because you have the keys to the market, you build on top of Open Bazaar a solution that lets people start posting on your store. You are now, effectively the Amazon of Open Bazaar. You have to pay for hosting, improvements to your market, and, dare I say, you will have to moderate your market. Why? Because you own the market. How do you pay for this? Well, you either take a percentage of each sale, or you require merchants to pay you up front to be on the platform. So, a marketplace on Open Bazaar can have an owner, just like a website can have an owner. So, now, let's say you want to sell raw milk, so you set up your own store on Open Bazaar. Certainly the platform can't prevent your sale of raw milk. Certainly you can't be censored from setting up the store in the first place. But the store itself is owned by you. You are the carrying agent for all the risk, and it is no different than setting up a website and selling raw milk there.
Simply put, Open Bazaar does not actually displace the risk to the seller, but worse than that, it doesn't change the paradigm of who owns the marketplace, since the marketplaces are owned by the people who run them. If you want a store that is decentralized, then you must find a marketplace that is 1) unable to censor your content (Open Bazaar's content can be censored just as easily as a website can be), and 2) removes the risk of owning the marketplace (Open Bazaar does not do this since the owner of the marketplace is still an individual). This is why something like Drop Zone makes sense. The marketplace, itself, is owned by the Bitcoin blockchain. The problem of selling illegal goods is largely mitigated by the participants not holding the data of their marketplace. If someone wanted your market data, they would need your Bitcoin private keys. Even still, the risk to individuals is mitigated to the degree they choose to mitigate it (the Drop Zone protocol allows for dead drops meaning that no one has to actually meet the seller, and the seller doesn't have to provide any information about themselves apart from their bitcoin public keys).
The point is, Open Bazaar doesn't actually solve any problems. It is just a science fair project that acts like an internet that is walled off of the www. I don't lack imagination. I have just spent a lot more time thinking about this problem than you or they have.
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:58:36
Consensus exists when consensus exists. You cannot simply wish for it to exist. Insisting on a timeline for consensus is very un-Bitcoin. It actually betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of this entire project. Mandating consensus by fiat is a bit like telling miners they should find blocks faster. It's absurd.

Oh god. Ok. Let me walk you though this. You can buy an S&amp;P 500 share with your dollars. You can also sell an S&amp;P 500 share relatively quickly. So the value of your money can be preserved. The liquidity problem can be easily overcome with debt vehicles like credit cards which can be paid off immediately so no debt is incurred. Your head is too far up an Austrian economist's ass to see the error in your thinking here. "Huge inflation" isn't a thing in the US. 3% inflation... is. In fact, 3% inflation is what the fed's stated inflation target is. The effect that you're discussing, when you take the economy out 100 years is the effect of compound interest. You want to know how to avoid inflation of 3%? Put it into a stock market that grows at 9.9%. Don't believe that's the growth rate of the stock market? Then you're a conspiracist who doesn't believe in real numbers.
Saifedean is an idiot. And I'll assume, as it is easy for me to do, you are new here. Welcome to Bitcoin. You believe in a world where all of Keynes is dumb and all of Mises is good. I call people like you Luddites. And you are blinded by the people you surround yourself with. For what it's worth, I doubt very much that you have ever read any actual Keynes.
RE: "If the economy needs money to degrade in order to work, how come the most prosperous time in America for the working and middle class was during the time we had a gold standard?" It wasn't. Stop being such a dolt. The most prosperous time in the US was when McDonald's released it's dollar menu and the poorest people in the economy were able to get enough food to feed them for a day for $2. $3 if they wanted a drink. The most prosperous time in America was when you could go anywhere in the world for about $1,000 on a machine that flies at around 600 MPH. The most prosperous time in America was the time that everyone, poor and rich, was able to pretty much carry around a supercomputer in their pocket. The poor, by the way, have a supercomputer in their pocket that is indistingishable from the supercomputer that Bill Gates has in his. In fact, poor people probably have iPhones and Android phones. Bill Gates has to se the insufferable Windows interface because brand. The most prosperous time in America was when all information was accessible by going to one location (Google) and searching for an answer. All information was recorded. We were able to fix our own cars using videos that volunteers and enthusiasts made and posted themselves.

No retailers wouldn't. I am a retailer. I have a very big store, and I know what the costs actually are. OB is as decentralized as a website. If you want to do a shitty store, you can install WordPress and Woocommerce. If you want to differentiate, you will add more stuff.
@_date: 2015-12-16 14:30:40
Haha, if you are asking me if I have done e-commerce, the answer is yes. And yes, I have even built an entire store, long before OB came around. If you would like to begin accepting Bitcoins at your own store, you can download and install u/brighton36's open source code here:  If you'd like to see my work in analytics and such, you can read my work on places like Moz: 


This is not correct. There is no solidity in the OB network. I know they make it sound like there is, but you shoudl ask them again. They will tell you it is not yet possible though they want to build it in someday. You could also accomplish this with hosting and a CDN, btw.


Escrow is hilarious, btw. You want to remove middle men, so you add one. Hahahaha. And no, their reputation system is censorable as well since it's not on the blockchain.


I do think it's something like magento or wordpress. The difference is that those are accessible via http and OB requires that you download a special browser. I coined the criticism against OB as being  It will be exactly like these options without the ability to be found in Google.

4) What does steemit have to do with a blockchain? Because if I showed you the bitcoin.com website, and told you it was the most trafficked site in the world, that wouldn't validate any arguments for or against Bitcoin. Steemit is a Ned's attempt at starting a content site. He says it's on a blockchain because that causes all of you to allow him to externalize the cost of maintaining a database. Effectively, you bootstrapped Medium. Nothing to do with a blockchain.

@_date: 2018-08-13 15:37:31
"The cost of college has tripled in less than ten years." - No it hasn't. The sticker price has gone up. Almost no one pays the full price. This is literally an example of price discrimination. Additionally, you're just wrong.  Prices have gone up 2.6x over the course of 20 years for private colleges. This is an annual growth of 7.85%. Over the same period of time, prices went up at 2.9x at out-of-state public colleges and 3.4x for in-state payers. The annual growth rate for them was 9.71% and 11.9% respectively. 2/3 of students receive scholarships. The average scholarship given is $5,750 for students going to public university. The average scholarship given to students going to private universities is $15,680. This means that the average public university student pays between $4,941 and $20,260 per year depending on whether they are applying in state or out of state. The average private university student pays $26,047. This represents the actual increase in price, since before college (as you deceptively wrote) tripled in 10 years, the actual annual percentage increase for 2/3s of college goers, whether they be in-state tuition payers, out-of-state tuition payers, or private universities payers actually increased 2.7%, 6.5%, and 3% annually, respectively. Stop lying. Examine your claims.

u/paulsnow said himself that the claim was overstated:
[8/14/15, 7:18:41 PM] junseth: To tell you the truth, I don’t believe for a second that you even got a commitment form Honduras.
[8/14/15, 7:21:21 PM] Paul Snow: We don't.
[8/14/15, 7:21:49 PM] Paul Snow: They moved it right up to the point of commiting, and ran into political issues.
I have spoken to the reporter, Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfus, who told me that her reporting was a spot piece, and did no fact checking. I have called the registry in Honduras, and they seemed to have no knowledge of Factom, but said they would get back to me with more information. That said, they have yet to respond. Snow said that they had asked the report not be released when it was released, but Gertrude says that she has records and phone calls from the day wherein Peter Kirby was asking the report to be expedited.
The project released the claim on the last day of their token sale, and they raised many funds post the announcement. I asked them to correct the record publicly, and Paul Snow stated that the country of Honduras asked them not to correct the record since they didn't want the attention, which is funny considering that Factom sells what amounts to truth token. Snow likes to show up and ask for people to show where the Factom team themselves say the word contract. But if you read the Reuters release, it's very clear that they intend for people to who are reading it to assume that the deal is said and done.
Needless to say, the claims are completely unexamined, and no evidence has been presented by Factom's team.

If you ran your store ON the Bitcoin blockchain and the FBI came to your house and took your computer, you wouldn't be shit out of luck. Your listings would still be up and unless you were storing your private keys on the computer unencrypted, you wouldn't actually have to store any of the data. You could aslo access those listings trivially over Tor, whereas OB doesn't work over Tor. Why not just make a website over Tor, anyhow, if you're going to go through the trouble of setting up a server? You might as well at least benefit from people being able to access your store via a regular web browser rather than the OB browser.

Thank you  I just saw this post and YouTube video. Your kind words are humbling.
I think it's hard not to sound fanatical. And to be honest, the panel really got me excited. They were articulating revolutionary advances in payment systems, and almost every one of them is something Bitcoin already does. And in a room of onlookers, it is hard to get that accross. When you're sitting next to "experts" in the space (and they actually are experts), it's hard to believe that a technology that exists outside of the incumbent system and whose idea was, apparently, conceived of by one person, could contain within it all the innovations that current payments have been dreaming of implementing. And while the synopsis I just gave completely ignores the works of the cypherpunks and the history of cryptographic currencies, to the lay man, Bitcoin didn't exist, and then suddenly now, it does. Reasonable people are going to have a hard time coming around, and we can't blame them. We just kind of have to keep talking about it, until everyone decides that it's here, staying, and completely normal. Then the real world-changing work of Bitcoin and her developers can begin.

I don't disagree that it's a word game. Which is why I defined what a credit card is to most people: a point-of-sale debt leveraging instrument. But your analogy to the horseless carriage is absurd. There isn't a conflation of a horseless carriage with something else. It was recognized as something entirely different than a carriage. Likewise, a debit card is a debit card. It is more like cash or BTC. A credit card is a credit card. It is more like a mortgage or a credit line or a bank loan. They are nothing alike save for the fact that right now, a debit card and a credit card are both cards that use the Visa, Mastercard, AMEX payment networks. You are living in an environment where people still use credit cards. You're not Shakespeare. You're not creating words (though it's debatable whether even he created words).
So you need to use words as people understand them. Right now, when you say credit card, people think point-of-sale debt instrument. There are other forms of point-of-sale debt instruments. Layaway is one of them. Though, Layaway holds your product in escrow as you pay a service fee for the storage and obsolescence of whatever you bought. Another point-of-sale debt leveraging instrument is called a credit line. Each of these are kinds of debt. Their differences are slightly nuanced, but not that difficult to understand. None of them are like cash or a debit card.
Will all of these words change some day in the future because of Bitcoin? Maybe. But what will they change to? Who knows? You certainly aren't the one who is driving linguistic trends. And just because we all agree that those words can and probably will change doesn't give you license to use them incorrectly today. My guess is that even if the word "credit card" changes, we will all look back on it in the future and understand what it is today, which is a point-of-sale debt leveraging instrument.

This is a typical structure of Libertarian arguments. You have lost site of your point. Your thesis is that holding money makes cash a liability. My point is that no one holds cash. You said that was asinine, and failed to acknowledge the fact that I'm correct. My point is that cash is designed to discourage you from holding it. It enforces you to act more rationally and invest your money into economically beneficial activities. This design works. The value of your money being less is a dumb metric because it is not meant as a store of vale. It is meant as a medium of exchange. If you got out of this book that cash is a liability and not an asset and that Bitcoin is where you should put your money, then congratulations on getting to Bitcoin, but you didn't get here by being a rational intellectual.

And when they do, they get chastized by the community. Scams are almost always obvious. The problem in Bitcoin is that there are a lot of people who scam themselves, cases where the scammers don't even know they're scamming, business plans that have no merit asking for money from BTCers, and then there are the out and out ponzis. Scams are easy. They really really are.

Not sure which part your insulted by. But I stand by the assessment that "BTC" is going to replace credit cards is not an interesting or rational analysis. No one here is arguing about the payment network-ness of Bitcoin. The question is whether it will replace credit cards. If you have a point of sale debt leveraging instrument, regardless of if it uses BTC to operate or not, it is functionally a credit card. But a debit card is not a credit card. I think that's fairly obvious. Xapo is releasing a Bitcoin debit card I thought. That's not really innovative. Since BTC operates like fiat, all a BTC debit card will do is act like fiat. That doesn't change anything but make a Bitcoin transaction feel like a fiat transaction. Also, I'm curious as to what kinds of debt instruments you are talking about. As far as I've seen, anyone who has created a Bitcoin debt instrument has ended up being a scammer. In the current ecosystem, you can't leverage Bitcoin. Maybe someday you will be able to, but the interest rates are going to be a completely different animal than they are in a fiat-centric, deflationary currency abounding world.

Also it's worth noting, I did not describe people who disagree with "my own superior assessment" as uneducated. I said that the statement "bitcoin's will replace credit cards" might be a compelling one to make to those who are uneducated. I'm also not making a statement judgmental statement about education. I am ambivalent to the affects of "being educated." I would say that being educated often stilts a person's perspective. Moreover, "being educated" is fundamentally different than knowledge acquisition. Being uneducated is distinctly different from being an idiot. I would assert that being both uneducated and an idiot is less dangerous than being educated and an idiot. But as I said, provenance matters. People listen to oracles. And oracles generally become oracles by asserting credentials. So for those who are making arguments about Bitcoin for the purposes of advancing the cause, it's important not to discredit yourself. Making statements that are very very false is a good way to do just that. You should be constructing generally honest arguments that are aimed at convincing the very highly educated as well as the least educated. Because BTC is good for all of them. can you weigh in here? I'd love to hear if I'm correct about your motivations for posting this question, and if my description of where these arguments are coming from is at all helpful for you.

Debit cards are not credit cards. This is the entire point of OP's question, and this continues to be the most inane conversation I have on a daily basis with Bitcoiners. Credit cards and debit cards are different things entirely. Just because they are both magnetic stripes and use the same network, it does not make them the same thing. Also, you are lying to yourself when you say you do not use it as a means of debt. Paying the credit card off after 30 days, means that you took an interest free loan for the amount on those cards during that time. That means you used it as a credit card and not as a debit card. So, it is literally very different for you than a debit card.

You are happy because they have "tested" the machine and the rate of failure is going to be almost 0% since they have rooted out all the bad machines.

Absolutely this.
In stock markets, you need shorting because, in some ways, it provides an incentive to out bad actors. In BTC, if you found a vulnerability, you could literally short the coin before exposing it. What that means very simply is that the vulnerability (depending on the money that flowed into the short) priced in the affects and risk of the vulnerability ahead of time. It's a good way 1) for someone who finds a vulnerability to be rewarded for finding it and 2) making sure that they can take a position that makes any sense for those that have information that are negative. In a good market, you should be able to make money on any information you have that others don't.
@_date: 2014-07-04 17:57:19
Ok. I've been debating this for so long with Bitcoiners. So here I am to explain what it is that BTCers are saying.
I would theorize that the big problem here is that Bitcoiners, on the whole are insular, unsocialized, largely introverted, and many of them are young and do not understand complex debt instruments - a credit card being one of the least complex that there is to understand.
So, this is the article that made me realize what people who say that BTC are going to replace credit cards actually mean ( The fact is, Visa and Mastercard make money on their payment network. They do not underwrite anything. The only thing they make money on is the payment network. So, Bitcoin threatens the payment network. Since debit cards, credit cards, and the like, use the MC, V payment network, often people who do not understand that the average American household carries something like $7k in credit card debt conflate debit cards and credit cards. This leads to an anecdotal perception of how credit cards are used. The assertion: if I don't use them to carry debt, then no one does. The conclusion: credit cards are the same thing as debit cards. The recursive leap: debit cards are going to be replaced by Bitcoin transactions, therefore credit cards will be replaced.
If you can understand that a credit card is not necessarily card (in places like Japan, NFC is often used to pay for things.), but, rather, what a credit card actually is, is a credit line that can be used at the point of sale, then the statement, "BTC will replace point of sale debt instruments" is absurd. If you define a credit card as a card, then you have no imagination, and I'm not sure how you're into something as forward thinking BTC.
So the comparison is 100% non-sensical for anyone who understand what a credit card is. The real questions that should be asked are things like, in a world where BTC is in hyper-deflation, does it make sense to loan money (as a bank) or to simply ride the deflation. There is a chance that debt (as it's structured) is incredibly inefficient and doesn't work in a BTC world - at least not in a world where BTC hyper-deflates. There also need to be questions about the role of debt and leveraged debt instruments in the world. Do we need an inflationary crypto on a BTC side-chain? Does that make sense in a world where markets are inter-connected. If we cannot leverage BTC, should we ever leverage? If leverage is inefficient, then BTC does, in fact, threaten credit cards. If we agree that there will always be leverage, then it doesn't.
Point is, I think that when people say, "BTC threatens credit cards," they are showing their ignorance. That's actually the wonder of this crypto currency. It works, it works regardless of whether the people who use it understand it. That's why it's remarkable. Also, I'm not saying that people who say this are dumb. But they certainly have a gaping hole in their understanding of the world, and probably lack a giant amount of empathy, considering they fail to conceive what a burden not being able to get that point of sale debt is to some people. Even still, Bitcoin works.
I think the real lesson is that the world is run by 16 year olds and the uneducated. Education doesn't necessarily help you. And if you assume that people aren't idiots then when you hear stuff like "BTC will replace credit cards," it's important, 1) to get to the kernel of what they are actually saying, and 2) help them to understand why it's non-sensical. Because those statements make you sound like an uneducated idiot to anyone who knows what they are talking about. And while it might be a great way to convince less educated people (probably the majority of the world) to jump onto the Bitcoin train, it is absolutely why those who are educated think that Bitcoin is a futile project. That said, uneducated people are probably the most likely people to be carrying massive amounts of credit card debt. If they think that your technology is going to take away their point of sale credit line, you probably just lost their support. That said, when smart people hear fanboys say that Bitcoin is going to replace credit cards, they think, "this person doesn't know what a credit card is, why should I listen to him about this thing he claims is going to threaten incumbent currencies." And, to be honest, the person who asks that question in the conversation is the one who can't be blamed. Provenance matters, and if you make yourself sound like an idiot, everything else that you say will be questioned. That last bit is just a public service announcement. I expect this to get downvoted to hell. But hopefully it will be helpful to @_date: 2014-11-04 13:39:32

This just isn't true. If you have sme questions about the systemic risks involved in some of these businesses, we can have it out. But those risks generally are what amount to actual proof. If someone is telling you that you can make money on something that is necessarily unprofitable, they are a scam (or they are scamming themselves). The math isn't difficult, and you can come to most of the conclusions simply by understanding a few principles and their actual extenuations, for example: markets are efficient.

False. There are very good reasons to carry debt.
And you're wrong. If you're using a credit card optimally (which is a far better word than responsibly, considering that responsible-ness is judgmental and not for you to assert), you would be using it as a way to take an interest free loan for 30 days so that you could make money on the float. Another great example of how BTCers don't understand the credit card as a debt instrument.
@_date: 2014-07-05 15:04:19
Ahh. Ok, well, you're right, that sounds like an insult. It's not meant to be. I'm doing my best to explain why Bitcoiners disagree with the points leveled in the argument, and after having argued it with probably a dozen or so people, those are the reasons I have come up with. It's unscientific, and unacademic, and based purely on anecdote. But I'm not really have the argument here with other BTCers, I'm giving a very specific answer to a question that has confused me for more than a year.
That said, I think I make my feelings pretty well known when I write:


Here's the thing, I'm very open to being proven wrong in a debate. People do it all the time, and anyone who has ever debated me in the real world will tell you that I concede as far as that goes. If you show me to be wrong, I will give up the ghost right there and then. But in this case, I'm not wrong. There is actually no good reason for making the statement, "Bitcoin's will replace credit cards." My overall point isn't that people who disagree with me are stupid. But, as you accused me of being, it is that Bitcoiner's are so far up their own arse that they refuse to be reasonable on points like this one. Just to show the unreasonableness, just read through the posts here. No one is engaging with the OP's question. They are just repeating, as if it's obvious, that BTC will replace credit cards. It's not me who is being disrespectful, it's those who refuse to put any thought into this question and consider that they have it all figured out. And yes, I think that even if the reason these posters refuse to engage the question has nothing to do with them being "insular, unsocialzed, and largely introverted..." the repeated refusal to engage the question does show a lack of respect for the debate as well as a lack of desire and a unconcern with being informed.
While I don't think I say directly, nor did I imply on purpose that people who disagree with me are anything more than uneducated on this very narrowly specific matter, I would say that, attitudinally, the desire not to learn is a lack of desire to be educated. If that is how they approach the rest of their life, then yes, they probably are uneducated. I strongly suspect it's not, BTCers on the whole are generally very smart and willing to learn. But I will say, on this question, they sound like morons.
My assessment above isn't really anything but a string of facts. I assume the OP is confused because based on those strings of facts, people still say, "Bitcoins are going to replace credit cards." Again, for anyone who knows what a Bitcoin is, and for anyone who truly understands what a credit card is, that statement is as stark and insipid as red will someday become blue or 1+1 will someday = 14. And every BTCer I've ever heard declare it with pride says it with such smugness that it's clear they think they have reached some very clever conclusion. And I even see critics of Bitcoin respond to the statement very positively. As I said above, the truth of it doesn't always matter. BTC works regardless of whether people's explanation of the protocol itself, or explication of how this all might cause the future to unfold is accurate. I would also say I chose my words very carefully. People that say this about credit cards are ignorant, not stupid. Ignorance is a lack of knowledge. I'm ignorant about how the protocol works largely. My understanding of it is rudimentary. I'm not a computer science type. Others whom I trust are, and they say it works very well and that it is rock solid. I would never make analogous declarations of the protocol like, "The block chain is LIKE two tigers making love" because I'll sound like an idiot. It doesn't mean I'm an idiot, it means I'm ignorant of how the blockchain technology works. That said, I will lean on the arguments of those who understand the blockchain or how mining works to explain it very simply to those who have questions. Gavin once said that the work of miners is like solving a Sodoku puzzle. You do work on a problem whose answers are not simple to compute, but whose answers are very simple to verify. The other explanation I've heard is the effective work of miners is simply ordering transactions. Combine these two explanations and you have a pretty good analogy about how mining works that you can take to almost anyone and explain by analogy a very complex process. I wouldn't explain it that way without having first had numerous conversations and listening to tons and tons of information by people who actually understand mining. I'm still not sure how it works technically, but that is my rudimentary grasp of how the complex process works.
That said, the difference between credit cards and debit cards is so chasmic, that comparing the two is ignorant. Saying that magnetic stripe is going away is interesting, but obvious. That isn't the result of Bitcoin. That has been going on in places like Japan for about 10+ years as a result of NFC technology going mainstream. I have a feeling, however, that 5 or 10 years from now when the card portion of credit cards is on your phone and not in your wallet, Bitcoiners will point and go, "see, I told you so." And I'll have to smack my face and point out that just because you aren't literally carbon copying someone when you "cc" someone in an email, we call it carbon copy because it achieves the same end. If you think that a credit card has to be a card, then you don't understand what is important about a credit card. What is important about a credit card is that it is a credit line that can be used at the point of service. So again, if you think that's what Bitcoin will replace, please give me a reasonable explanation of how.  I'm open to understanding. I'm skeptical at the moment. The questions I pose above are actual, good questions that I would like to hear answers to. But as far as that goes, I'm assuming that most Bitcoiners won't bother to spend the time articulating that BTC will replace a point of sale debt instrument because most Bitcoiners don't know that that's what they are actually saying when they say "Bitcoin will replace credit cards."

Not going to disagree. I'm still convinced that the reason this didn't go to trial, however, is'nt because Ross didn't do it, it's because it would have tainted the rest of the case.

This is absolutely true. Colored Coins was a great first attempt to make this a reality. Nowadays, I'm very bullish on Counterparty for this reason. I wrote a blog post on remittances a few months ago  This is an extension of the point made here. But yes, anything will very soon be able to be exchanged with anything else. Shapshift's business model will also exist in a completely decentralized way with things like the counterparty DEX. Any sort of bearers' note that can be tokenized will be able to be very easily tokenized. And smart contracts will make things instant, automatable. Interbank settlement will be able to happen between your Magic the gather boardgame ( and Chase bank's USD, however they implement that. One thing is certain, they will eventually implement it. And everyone's understanding of value will be suddenly and instantly flipped upside down.

From the lawyers I've spoken to it sounds to me like the fact that the murders for hire being used to keep him away from being able to get out on bail was never objected to by Ross's lawyers after the charges were dropped.

These graphs are normalized graphs. They aren't showing volume, they are showing relative volume over time. So if you have a that usually gets 10 searches each month, then one month gets 100 searches, then drops to around 20 searches each month, the normalized graphs like this will show a huge swing that makes it look like search went to the moon. When you extend it out, and you realize that there was one week where searches went from 10 searches each month to 10,000, and then back down to 10, it will make the swing from 10 to 100 look tiny as well. I hate when people post google graphs in this subreddit because no one knows what these are measuring and it's asinine.
The graph ranges not from 0 to 1 million, but from "never been searched" to "the most search this term has ever had in a given period." The graph is only helpful if you know what you're looking at.

Every transaction has a level of counterparty risk. The goal is to lessen it, not remove it completely. Even Bitcoin has counterparty risk. As long as it is working as it should, however, that risk is mitigated by the war of miners that is going on to prevent one another from making the chain insecure. And that war is regulated by economics. And the mechanics of those economics are ensured through the protocol.

Sam, you are comparing apples to oranges here. You can reference all sorts of things from the blockchain using the internet. Or you can download the blockchain to your own computer, if you'd like. But for those who use the Blockchain to store that data, the experience is seamless. It could power an entire tor-wrapped site with no need for the user to know that all the data is pulled directly off of the blockchain. The data is held on the blockchain, so even if a store was taken down, the listings and ratings remain. That is what immutability does.

21 sold a miner, which was pitched as a perpetual motion machine. I bought one because it is hilarious. It gained numerous names such as the 21 PiTato (because it was a $400 asic attached to a Raspberry Pi), and the Butt Box. They turned off the production of the butt box and liquidated their supply on ebay pretending that they were doing it through a third party. Then they pivoted to email addresses that you can generate requiring people to pay to contact you. People like Adam Back generated profiles  I did myself as well. Suddenly a number of us have had our accounts deleted. The explanation from 21.co is that we are impersonating people. But that's pretty clearly not the case here. And even if it were the case, it has nothing to do with why they selected certain accounts for deletion.

It's irrelevant whether the expense of WU is the cost of moving things in the database. Remittance is perfect for disintermediation of third parties. It just is. But what we forget in Bitcoin is that usually we think that this technology will enhance those in that industry if  they adopt. But we forget that what it actually does is displace those actors. So WU will be shoved out of remittance as we know it today. They may continue to do something remittance-y, but it will be very different than they or you thought it was in exactly the same way that banks are not going to look like banks in 10 or 15 years.

"so if these are all killer apps why arent people using them?"
Because Bitcoiners have been distracted with alt coins and stupid projects for the last few years. So, some of the actually valuable projects are sort of just being developed in quiet. Counterparty being one of them.
This is absolutely true. Trusted third parties do enter the equation in this scenario. The problem isn't trusted third parties necessarily. The question is about how trusted are they. Like if Wells Fargo were to issue the asset and use it internally, I bet you'd trust it pretty implicitly. this is abotu backend techs. If WELLSFARGOUSD were issued using Counterparty or something like that, you'd actually be able to move in and out of the money on the blockchain with a high level of confidence that you could convert it back into dollars because if in the Wells Fargo system it would be as good as dollars. If you have enough institutions doing this, you end up with a network effect that requires a consolidation of the asset. So you might actually have them ask the Fed to issue and distribute the asset. Now, if you don't like the fed, that's an entirely different discussion. But my point is that this is possible with the Bitcoin blockchain tech.
And it's cheap. If it's posisble and cheap, it will probably happen. I'm saying that because this is possible, you actually lose the need to have companies doing remittance. And it becomes pretty clear that remittance will be done frictionlessly using the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:01:33
They are metacoins. XCP is used to run smart contracts and can be used to hold other moneys in escrow. But their entire system is built on the blockchain. That's why Counterparty is so remarkable. It is the first "killer app" as people say, of Bitcoin. It extends the functionality such that you do not need to transact in BTC on the blockchain save for when you move tokens.

I think this is a distinction without a difference. What I'm saying is obviously an analogy. But The Blockchain is an overwrought kludge that does exactly one thing: disintermediation of third parties. I think that's very Rube Goldbergish. It doesn't mean it's not useful, it simply means that it's big and klunky, but it's the only thing we've ever seen that does what it does.


Nothing you just said is something I disagree with. I regularly say that the Byzantine General Problem is an economics problem, not a computer science one. Bitcoin is the money of the blockchain. But you need to be able to disambiguate the two as well.


Well, we shall see. You may be right. But I would assert that Bitcoin gives the state the ability to gain even more control of the currency. That said, my point wasn't that the state will issue them. It's that companies probably will be the first. As I say, Coinbase will probably issue CoinbaseUSD or something.


Bitcoin or the printing of cryptographically verifiable money does not preclude the ability of the state to obfuscate fiscal policy. it would, however, give them the ability to better control their fiscal policy.


Thank you muchly. And fair criticism is fair. You are allowed as many issues as you want. And time will dictate which of us is right. That said, if you see anything technical (not philosophical) that you believe to be incorrect, please let me know. If you disagree with me philosophically, let's have it out.

No, I fully understand what Bitcoin solves. Simply because you can dis-intermediate third parties, it doesn't mean that it's always a good idea. You can also dis-intermediate a lot of their functions, but not all of their functions. Like, for example, you could use the blockchain to perform escrow services in conjunction with CP. That is a function that will exist. In that sense, your bank could be the or one of many oracles in a transaction. What banks will look like in the future is going to be mind-blowingly different. But you can't decentralize all the things. You can decentralize many of them. The goal is to remove counterparty risk when it is more efficient that it is removed. Not to simply remove it altogether from all things.

A business exposes itself to all sorts of systemic risk. In the case of Bitcoin there is volatility risk, there is exchange risk, there is governmental risk, and more. However, if an institution can exchange natively on the Blockchain w/o having to go between the currency of the blockchain and the currency they are approved to transact in, a large amount of that systemic risk can be removed. Frankly, this is why businesses should dump BTC when they receive them. The risk profile of a business should be very narrow and specific. So, if they want to be a trader, if that is their strategy, then the risk they expose themselves to is the volatility. They like it because a trader becomes an expert at trading and making money when the price goes up or down. A company like Microsoft, on the other hand, expects to make x% profit, and does not want to engage in the risk of trading since that is not among their core competencies. Exposing those profits to risk is irresponsible. Supposing they do want to expose them to risk, however, then Microsoft will hand their money to an internal team that has expertise in trading. They will allocate that money according to their own internal trading strategy. Anyhow, not to digress too much, but the reason to use a meta layer on top of BTC instead of BTC itself is so that you can get all the advantages of BTC with an understood risk profile.

 when you break up pools, you have broken up the block creator. That's important because that is an attack vector. Now in the case of Bitcoin, we would notice very quickly. But in the case of a merge mined coin, I would bet that the people on Discus fish don't care about that attack vector so long as their attack vector isn't available on Bitcoin. I would be willing to bet, in fact, that less than 5% of Discus miners even have any idea they are merge mining namecoin or that they would be willing to leave if they did start attacking it. Best example of this is CoiledCoin.
My point is that you are eating the sandwich twice for the same price. This is quintescentially a free lunch. You're doing 1 set of hashes for two chains. Good enough if it works. But I have yet to be explained why it's not a free lunch.


100% yes. If it exists and is not attacking, the mere existential threat of it should be enough to prove my point. Luke is fine wiht it because he likes keeping the spam off the chain.

To be fair, I mean the Bitcoin blockchain. That said, I think you're point is correct. It will be the blockchain technology that kills remittance. And, as that blockchain is currently constituted, it will probably the Bitcoin blockchain that does it. That said, there is definitely room for debate. Once people build apps for blockchain-based asset management, however, I don't see a lot of reason to care about technologies like Ripple since the BTC blockchain can and will accomplish the same task.

The project he's talking about is Lets talk Bitcoin. He is certainly right that LTB is responsible for a huge number of the txs on the blockchain. The token who saw trading of $39 yesterday is a pretty useless counterparty token and is distributed in a way that makes the team over at LTBCoin seem like rubes. Adam uses it to sell ads on his network, and that, as far as I can tell, is its entire utitlity.
Striving to be the coin with the most transaction volume on the blockchain or in the counterparty project is a bit laughable. Your asset should have some utility (like with SOG assets which are playing card tokens). What Adam and team should consider doing is siloing their coins and letting users export them upon need. Adam Levine regularly complains about the cost of being greater than 50% of the counterparty network, and he could easily solve this by simply asking users to accumulate Adambucks, and then paying a small output to export the value when they need to (like to send it to an exchange or to pay for an ad).The process would look like this: you log in to LTB, you go to the page where your balance is displayed, you hit export, a QR code pops up with a text field for you to put the wallet address you want the coins sent to, and you use any other wallet to pay a small amount for the export of the value. This will allow you to do distributions 100% free! Being &gt;50% of the network in this case means you are wasting a lot of money, and it is a gross display of incompetence. The reason you hear people say "fuck you chris/junseth" is because you hang out in a crowd filled with morons. When you are serious about solving your problems, we will happily help. :)

I agree Eric. But Garza shouldn't speak. I don't mind the Q&amp;A, but I'm skeptical he will show up. My hope is that Levin fills the time with someone from the Counterparty project. I know that everyone has a horse in this race, but IMHO, if you're having Ethereum speak, it's hard (maybe even disingenuous) to not also have Counterparty get some time considering the incredible work that they have done this year. That said, I'm going in any case.

You can use the blockchain using small amounts of BTC. But with these layers being built on top o fit such as Counterparty, Mastercoin, and the like, the small amount of flake needed to transact on the chain actually adds an interesting dimension to one's ability to move value on the chain. I could, for example, move the representation of 1 billion USD on the blockchain using tokenization and something like three cents worth of BTC.

Well, I disagree that you're better off using Ripple. You're absolutely correct about everything you say here regarding the benefits of Bitcoin. But in a world where remittance is, in fact, still needed (the presence of remittance indicates that there is a central issuing authority).
I'm sure that there are pitfalls in the idea, but Wells Fargo, for example, could use these meta-layers for their system of account. That would very mean, very simply, that they would honor their $1 token as $1 since it would represent the $1 in your bank account. Banco Brazil could do the same. That means, since it's decentralized, you could convert between the two on a decentralized exchange. That's just one scenario. But again, as I said earlier, time will show us who is right.

@_date: 2015-01-22 16:03:57
It's not worth making enemies of Gates. The reason for a statement like this is probably misinformation. He might even be right. But it's a moot point. Reversal of transactions ATM requires a trusted third party, which means that centralization is the most efficient way to do that. For that, solutions already exist. If people like Gates think that this is an important part of the system, then they need to understand that they are proposing a problem that is not solved by BTC and is solved very easily by banks, mastercard, visa, and their contemporaries. That said, with smart contracts being built into platforms like Counterparty, there may be a way in the future to do transaction reversals without that third party. And that functionality is built on the blockchain. Moreover, if he's concerned about BTC volatility, it means that what Gates doesn't know yet is that the Blockchain is currency agnostic. While BTC is the current currency of the blockchain, it probably doesn't always have to be, and using tokenization on the blockchain, a person can basically trade USD, Reals, Rubles, whatever currency they want. They could even trade currency baskets on the blockchain. I'd be willing to bet that Ripple's functionalities will all be built on the BTC blockchain in the not so distant future. So, while I applaud Gates for dipping his feet in the miry waters of Bitcoin, I don't think he's leveled up enough to be making declarations about the state of Bitcoin quite yet.

@_date: 2015-05-13 06:18:09
Right now, to put information into the blockchain, the cost is relatively expensive. You can put a few kb of data into the chain for a small price. If you want to put a lot of information into one transaction, it gets expensive. The idea that an increased block size will not cause the price of inserting information to drop, or that people will not change their behavior as a result of the increased block size is a 100%, complete unknown. It is arrogant to assume that the manner in which the blockchain is used will reflect the manner in which it is used today. Moreover, the cost of running a node may increase. So, while businesses may need to run them, there is a chance that running a node will become so cumbersome that a business will not be able to bear the expense. I would think that this is unlikely because data is relatively cheap to store. But who knows? Additionally, we do not know who is running nodes or for what reason. It is presumptuous to assume that they are run for any reason considering we don't have any actual data on that. I'm not sure where I stand on the increase. I'm largely of the opinion that letting the core devs argue it out will (probably) lead to an optimal conclusion and that non-programmers like myself ought to remain spectators rather than pretending we know anything about this part of the tech. What I don't enjoy are speculations and theories without any actual, non-anecdotal evidence.

There are a lot of people interested in what you are doing. If I believed for a second that credibility was obtained through quantity of approval or number of spectators cheering for a team, I wouldn't be in Bitcoin my friend.
I do think you're team is incapable of understanding Bitcoin. I think that you decided you had figured out how to solve a problem that you didn't understand and have run full-speed down that road. No one working on DZ wants the drug dealers. But in a truly uncensorable market, you will get them. You are liars, you misrepresent the facts of your project all the time. But my guess is that your lies are more bumblings. I just don't think you know what you're building.
As to whether I'm an ass hole, it shouldn't matter. I'm willing to be an ass hole. I'm not the one taking stands on Twitter and calling the core devs poopy stinky pants because they demonstrated an exploitable weakness of the Bitcoin tech in a way that hurt nobody but proved the point. Your originaly thesis is all of this was that asking hard questions made me an ass hole. I'll take it. But as the questions were answered, my suspicions have been further and further confirmed. I'm not a politician, I don't make snarky remarks about things because I believe the community will be behind me (submitting a issue that Coinbase should be re-added to Bitcoin.org).

You don't. that's why this is so funny.


Where are you going to hide them? A hole in the ground? You can make your private keys as inconvenient to get as you want. The associated price of recovering your coins could be astronomical too. That would be hilarious. Again to my original point, ACTUALLY securing your Bitcoin wealth is tedious and time consuming.


That's not just my opinion. I suspect your bitcoins aren't actually insured. Moreover, telling someone they have committed a "logical fallacy" is not an argument. It's cute, but it's not actually engagement. Especially when a person's grasp of the fallacies os as tenuous as yours.


I'll let you argue that to your insurance company.


Yes. It was a poor argument because your argument was a crazy rant. I don't need to argue it. You're just wrong. You want me (as you say later on) to assume you not an idiot. But you're arguing against the basic functionality of a market with semi-rational actors. You can lie in that bed. I don't need to do anything else.


This is your point because you don't understand my point. My point isn't that Apple would be worth the same today as in the future. It's that it would be worth the same as the increases it currently has less the inflationary pressure. Thus, Apple would be worth... I don't know... 11% increase per year or whatever it is, minus the inflation during that same time. Very simple. I could engage with you on your level, but I would be assuming anyone who reads this is an idiot. I don't. I assume only one person in this exchange is.


I'm not going to engage with the other part of this because it's non-sensical. You are a crazy person. But yes, a 500% ROI over 50 years would assume an incredibly reasonable level of inflation (about 3%). You shouldn't make that loan. Again, you can measure this against a benchmark. You wouldn't make that loan because the market has returned an average of about 9% per year. You lose 6% in the opportunity of not holding cash - a 4,100% increase. By the way, we have banks because you wouldn't make that loan. They need a 9ish% return on their holdings. So they have figured out how to do that by making 3.4% or so loans. You don't know how to do that because you're not a loan making specialist and you don't have the supply chain or diversity of loans to bundle and sell them.


That would be dumb for whomever took the loan. The person paying your loan back has the potential to go bankrupt simply because of the volatility. You'd likely achieve userous rates. Congrats! Why would a person take that loan when they can get a reasonable loan at a bank which specializes in the practice of loan making? The chances of you getting your money back on a Bitcoin loan are very very low, by the way. This is because you aren't a loan specialist, there is not really a very good legal framework for you, as an individual, to make that loan. The risk commensurate would be articulated in your potential returns. Good luck! Btw, my statement doesn't prove your point. You have no point there. Your arguing an absurdity.


It's a feature. And it's a feature that caused you to invest in Bitcoin. Well done Fed!


This is a bad assumption. There are no guarantees anywhere. Bitcoin inflates all the time.


You didn't, it's clear.


You're consulting with a crazy. I'd at least use the back of a napkin. It will make your math more credible. 


I would ask again. How old are you? You don't understand basic things. It's apparent that you either live under a rock, are a legitimate cray cray, or are 16.


I assure you that from your end, there has been no intellectual conversation here. You can accuse anyone of ad hominem. But you seem incapable of making arguments of any affect or reading refutations with an honest eye. The "argument" doesn't register on your pyramid because I wasn't making an argument. I was telling you that you weren't making an argument either - which you weren't. You were just saying words at me.


Reading your stuff is like trying to parse an instruction manual for a 10k item bike. They are overwrought, and at the end, the bike doesn't look like the picture in the manual. Your thought experiments are terrible. You are the one that distinguished between monetary inflation and price inflation. You then said they are completely different things. You then went on to describe price inflation. You then told me that that was monetary inflation and that you had just shown how it was different than price inflation. I pointed this out. Now you're saying that your actual argument was that monetary inflation leads to price inflation. So we're back at the original point I made, which is that you don't know how inflation works - which I think is pretty clear by the circuity of your arguing to get back to my original point. I said, "Monetary inflation is uninteresting. Libertarians, in particular, like to claim that it is bad because it is bad. It is only "bad" in a world where price inflation becomes problematic." You have now told a story wherein monetary inflation leads to price inflation. Which... was my point.


This is a re-casting of the argument. You do this a lot. You can argue all you want that war is bad. I don't live in that world. Bad/Good dichotomies are just kind of impossible to argue against or for. I believe war happens. The best you can hope for is a mitigation of damage. And yes, you made the argument about war deaths, trotted out an extraordinary example, then had to smell the poop you just made when I gave you the actual data. So your option is to re-cast the argument. That's fine. But it's dishonest. And yes, these times might be more turmulous than previous times. I think your argument is that in a world with no inflation, that wouldn't be true. I don't buy that. No one buys that. If you want to get into the foreign policy weeds, we certainly can. You know nothing about foreign policy, neither do I. I'm willing to bet experts would laugh at your notion that war would just kind of be a dissipate concern with no inflation.


Lol, well, I guess we're back to arguing price inflation, despite your desire to disambiguate and only discuss monetary inflation. Price deflation might, at times, help the poor. It is also a sure sign of a waning economy. You will likely end up with fewer jobs, fewer people willing to spend, and a bunch of other consequences that you probably don't know about because you accept the Libertarian claim that deflation is *a priori* a good thing. Oh and yes, you are definitely a Libertarian of some sort. You asked to not have the political trebuchet lobbed your way. But it seems you have at least conceded that point.

Not if you hold dollars under your bed. But you don't. You should be taking those dollars and investing them in stocks. So that when, as you say, the dollar goes poof, you will retain the same purchasing power when the government re-boots its currency. Libertarians love to believe that currency failures are going to cause a global reboot that will leave them rich. That's not how that works. Currency failures beget new currency. Modern failures like the Ruble or the dozen or so that Brazil rebooted and rebooted in the 80s are great examples of how this will actually go. There is a long period of pain, but the country gets back on its feet and Libertarians still have their stupid gold, for which they are unable to use because gold is a medium of exchange which is too value dense.

Bitcoin bowl night was one of the most important nights in my Bitcoin life, if that is an acceptable phrase.
I was in Sarasota for a family Christmas, which, lucky for me, was just down the road from St. Petersburg. On the 26th I made the short drive North, where I met with u/brighton36. All the usual suspects were there: Pumper Moe Levin, David Bailey, Tony Gallippi, his sister Connie and their mother, all the Bitpay staff, Will Pangman and more. We were given press credentials and a ticket, both of which you can see [here]( [Bitpay tweeted]( that there was even a Bitcoin accepting cab. It seemed as though Bitpay had really done a lot of work to prime the city for the event.
We weren't really supposed to have it, but we were basically given free reign of the stadium, and eventually were even given access to the locker room area. We also got up onto the sponsor platform where all the Bitpay team was. I remember being struck with how stressed out Tony looked. There was a sort of pall over the executive team at Bitpay that I couldn't figure out, though a year later, we have [learned quite a bit about]( In days leading up to the bowl, we had heard that OKCoin, who was going to be one of the games big sponsors, had pulled out of their commitment (sound familiar), as a result of backing one of Bitpay's competitors. At least that's what was told to us. That left Bitpay to fund the whole cost of the sponsorship largely on their own. So now, having been robbed for nearly $2 million (which we didn't know then, remember) they were also on the hook for a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract for putting the generic Bitcoin logo onto a bowl field. It was a pretty neat, altruistic move, but I'm not entirely sure it was wise, though who knows.
Before the game, we made our way to the parking lot where the most hardcore football fans had already begun drinking. "What do you know about Bitcoin?" We asked. It became pretty clear that no one even knew that Bitcoin or Bitpay proper was the sponsor of the game. No one knew what a BTM was, no one used or had any Bitcoin. To the attendees it was just the St. Petersburg bowl game. Walking into the stadium, I was told there were some lonely BTM machines parked around, though I saw no evidence of them, though they did exist outside the stadium beforehand. It would be interesting to see what kind of actual use they got out of them if they existed. The in-stadium vendors, we were told, did not accept Bitcoin. So while you could supposedly acquire your coins at a fairly substantial premium in the stadium, you couldn't spend them... anywhere.
We didn't really watch the game. Let's be honest, we're Bitcoiners, no one here is into sportsing. Pumper Moe and David Bailey had a 1 Bitcoin bet on who would win, if memory serves me correctly. But that was the only evidence I saw of any real sports interest out of a Bitcoiner. The rest of us were eating the spread and dranking the drink.
After the game, we made our way to the party tent where we hung out with all the Bitcoiners. It was a sort of anyone who is anyone party. Lots of recognizable coiners were there. As fun as any Bitcoin party (conference) has ever been, I figured that if nothing else, it was a great time for the city to see the power of Bitcoin. After the revelry, around 1AM, we called the cab driver who Bitpay had informed us of. He came and picked us up at the party tents and four of us filed into his SUV. On the way back to our AirBnB, we started asking him questions.
"How many riders used Bitcoins with you today?"
"Not even one. You're my first. I couldn't believe it," he told us.
"Yeah, I was told that there would be hundreds of Bitcoin users around today and that Bitcoin would be an excellent way to make some extra money, but I didn't even get 1 customer who wanted to use it."
When he dropped us off, he muttered some profanities under his breath about how much of a bust the day was, booted up his Bitpay app and fumbled through it. It was obviously his first time using it. We sent him coins, the app confirmed, and we got out of the cab.
We didn't say a word for about 5 minutes as we ascended the stairs to where we were staying, not one. We closed the door behind us and all I was able to muster was a, "holy shit, no one uses Bitcoin." Here we were, surrounded by the biggest Bitcoin event in the history of our fair experiment, and not one Bitcoiner bothered to use it. Before you get huffy, let me remind you, that it wasn't only filled with Bitcoiners, but the company that had taken on itself the primary responsibility of being Bitcoin's chief promoters. A Bitcoin-exclusive company, filled with Bitcoin-enthusiasts couldn't be bothered to use Bitcoin in the city that they had named the Bitcoin capital of the world. I realized at that moment that Bitpay was in trouble. We did some back of the envelope calculations and figured out what their approximate run-rate was, and figured if they didn't fire some employees from their very obviously bloated staff, they would be out of business by about December of this year (just passed). The hubris of the company going around spending money willy nilly, encouraging its employees to do interviews instructing other enthusiasts on how to get a Bitcoin career, purchasing and having their fingers in the most "important" Bitcoin media outlets would have been astounding to you if you had been in that room with me. It felt like someone had punched me in the gut.
The lesson you should take from this is that you are very likely not a Bitcoin user. And amidst all these heated debates like block size and confirmation times, and every other goddamn thing you think is important, the thing that I know about you that you don't know about you, is that given the opportunity to use Bitcoin, you will take your principled Libertarianism and shove it up your ass. This movement is filled with more spectators than a football bowl game. For all the bitching and moaning about how much you need Bitcoin to do this or that, the truth is, most of you are not trying to optimize Bitcoin for its users. You are doing your darndest to help build Bitcoin for spectators. So the next time you think about the scaling debate, or you consider what Bitcoin needs, consider it from the perspective of a meth addict, or a heroine user, or a prostitute who can't have a bank account. Those are the people for whom Bitcoin is immediately useful. If that's not you, then coming onto r/bitcoin and explaining what it is Bitcoin needs to do to be useful makes you an arrogant ideologue. Because, as all the most important Bitcoiners demonstrated on Bowl night, if you don't need to use Bitcoin, you won't.

No, the main critique is that we don't have a product. It is just a permissionless marketplace. The efficiency is for the underserviced Sam. Contraband = things that are illegal to sell. So, Bibles in North Korea, drugs in the US, porn in Iran - all contraband. In Portugal, drugs aren't contraband. But there are other underserviced markets too where holding the data might serve significant risks to people. Local Bitcoins is a perfect example. Selling Bitcoins, or being the owner of a site like Local Bitcoins, is a high-risk activity. That is a underserviced market. So you can say whatever you want, but you again show a lack of depth that should worry any follower of your project.

If you do something illegal, it is on you, no doubt. But you are incorrect. Each of these listings, subsequent purchases, etc, are reputation events. In order to record those, you need to store them immutably. You do not get that on OB. Moreover, the danger here is in who owns and stores the data. Ulbricht went to jail because the website, the marketplace itself, was his. He owned it, his database controlled it. In the case of OB, each individual store owner is in the same position. It will be their storefront, they will hold the data. So if they are doing something for which the problem is the holding of the data itself, OB provides no advantage over an online store.

* Multisig/escrow is darn neat, but you can do that on any DNM. We don't call those Bitcoin projects. They are just stores. Moreover, you can replicate any of these features on a Wordpress+Woocommerce installation. Wordpress+Woocommerce isn't a Bitocin project. You can also accept and use Bitcoin's many features on centralized platforms like Magento or Shopify or through Ebay with Paypal. If OB is a Bitcoin project, then so is Ebay, Shopify, and Magento. The only thing that makes people think OB has anything to do with Bitcoin is that they use it for advertising.
* Merchant-IDs in the blockchain are pointless. So what? There is no counterparty risk in merchant IDs. And that could be as simple as making a merchant-ID a public address. This is not a OB innovation, it is a Bitcoin innovation.
* Using proof of burn to gain trust... this isn't in any way relevant. It's a protocol, and this is a proposed economic system endemic to the protocol. The notion that those with the most to gain (scammers) but who need the platform least, would not be willing to burn, but those with the least to gain but who need the platform most (small, new businesses who are trying to see if there is a market for their product) would be willing to burn to create profiles, is absurd. The idea here is to prevent sybil attacks. But calling something Spam is a judgment that shouldn't be made at the protocol level. That is why http doesn't ban spam, but Google and webrings let people sort around and through it.
* Decentralized p2p rating system is a cute idea. I have read Dr. Washo's proposal numerous times, and I think it's a lot of words, nothign interesting, and almost nothing peer to peer about it. Also, this rating system has nothing to do with Bitcoin.


This isn't true at all. Other people run full nodes, you do not have to. Even still, this is not the equivalent of running an OB store. A full node is a copy of everyone's accounts on the B/C. An OB node is not, it is just your store, and a way to connect and route to peers so you can find stuff. If your bitcoin node goes down, the network isn't even slightly damaged. If your OB node goes down, your entire store goes with it.
As to why OB won't work? It provides absolutely 0 efficiency over the current system. It doesn't work over http, it uses UDP. So you can't link to products or benefit from Google crawling your store without a huge amount of rigmarole. A person has to have the alternative OB client installed on their machine to make it work. In the way that children had to host their html experiments on their home network in the early 90s, you will have to host your own OB store on your home computer. If your traffic is too much for your local service to handle, you will have to put it on a third party platform. So while OB developers like to claim that the network isn't censorable, they are not saying who it is censorable from. Right now, they're claim is that etsy, ebay, amazon, and the like can kick you off their platform. That's all well and good, but then you can go and start your own website if you would like. The cost to move from their platform to your own is virtually 0. Bitcoin works because it is censorship resistant from governments. It wouldn't be considered censorship resistant if the censorship resistance was limited to Ebay. It also wouldn't be interesting. You would be laughing at Bitcoin if it were claiming it's censorship resistant to Ebay and that's why it's cool. That's what OB is claiming, because they know there is no governmental censorship resistance. Whether you advocate full censorship resistance or not, the reason Bitcoin or Tor or the internet itself are so interesting is because they are permission-less, not because they are standing up to the great, evil powers of Ebay or Amazon. The tech only works if it's censorship resistant to everyone.

@_date: 2016-01-01 17:37:07
That is what their team is saying. But it's a complete misrepresentation. Sellers host their own stores, which means that each "store" is just like a website. So if your criticism of stores being online is that they are censorable, or that products on ebay are censorable, all the ways that law enforcement has to censor websites now, will be equally available on OB. u/CC_EF_JTF knows this, as does the rest of the team. But they refuse to be honest about the project's actual censorship resistance because they know that if they did, the network they have built would disappear in an instant.
@_date: 2016-01-04 13:39:21
Well, it might be. The difference between all that have come before it is very simply, were the shares that were sold on a blockchain previous to this actually legal? The answer is possibly "no." That would, in fact, make this the first issuance of a share on a blockchain... if... and this is a big if... if what NASDAQ issued them on is actually a blockchain and not just a database. I'm willing to bet that it isn't a blockchain, which means that this can't be the first time such shares have been issued on one of these things. As to whether the previous issuances were legal, that is for a court to decide.
@_date: 2016-01-01 21:47:20
Ok. Well, you don't need to be technical to grasp this. They are building a system that allows end-users to host their own store. So, simply, your store will be on your home computer. If you turn your computer off, your store goes off. So if you get a lot of traffic, so that your home Comcast bandwidth can handle it, you are going to have to put it into the cloud to host it. So suddenly, you have a system that is hosted in places it can be taken down - just like a website. They can state anything they want, but they have built a completely stupid, unsolid system with no decentralization. It is decentralized like the internet is decentralized. While the protocol itself is not centralized, the stores themselves (just like a website) are, and those are where all the risk was in the first place.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:28:12
Actually, it would never not be now. This is a concept called taking your risk early. For peace of mind, and for reasonableness, I have tended to take a more balanced investment approach wherein I have dollar cost averaged. But truthfully, in a world where you are modeling compensation for risk, and that risk has a tendency to compensate you for the actual risk (it isn't mean reverting), then the best time for you to buy is always now rather than later. You will be, on average and over the long term, compensated for taking on higher risk by taking the risk now rather than taking it later. But honestly, because we're not all milionaires with Scrooge McDuck vaults, I would strongly recommending setting up an auto buy every week for a small amount that you can afford and just letting it run. The better advice is don't buy Bitcoin if you don't understand Bitcoin. But no one ever takes that advice. So I'll leave you with this reasonable peace of thinking.

You have to be a child to believe that. Stuff becomes cheaper because middle men fight for making supply chains cheaper. The iPhone 6 becomes cheaper because it is obsolete. The iPhone 7 comes out like 2 years after the iPhone 6. It has 2 years more technology in it. If you can't see the value in 2 years worth of technological advancements, you'd have to have be nuts. Supply chains become cheaper, science drives price down (OLEDs), and you are the beneficiary. This is all done through debt financing. And you can call that slavery. But slavery is a black dude working in a field picking cotton by force. The comparison is flippant, and probably incredibly offensive. Your slavery involves cheaper products that you freely get to buy, and an egalitarian benefit to all humanity through logistics/supply chain improvements. As a result of Eli Whitney and the development of combines, there is no risk to you at all of having to end up picking cotton or any fruit/vegetable for that matter. So try removing the rhetoric, and make a point that actually has any merit at all.

That's not how insurance works. Uber is fighting back regulation. The reason taht taxi drivers haven't done this already is because the legal infrastructure is such that if you're caught, you are fined severely by the municipality you're driving in. Uber merely provides insurance to these cabs such that if they are caught, Uber will pay the fee. You think that the incentive to decentralize is on the side of the riders. but the incentive is actually on the side of the drivers.

Haha, they won't see a discount. :)
Someone has to absorb that risk. If you're a seller, you're probably going to try to earn any gains you see from the platform. That is, in fact, the pitch here. Sellers are complaining about having to pay 10-15%. You think they are now excited to hand that savings off to customers?
This is why this entire debate is so laughable to me. Ya'll believe the most intellectually incongruous things. Just think about it. If you are a seller, and suddenly a new platform shows up, you're telling me that merchants will take on the risk of that new platform and go create content there? Why? Well, the answer you'll give me is that they don't want to pay the 10-15% risk because that's such a burden. You probably also believe that the 10-15% is rent extraction from such companies as Ebay/Amazon. So the pitch for merchants is that they will come to OB to make more money than they were. But you simultaneously argue that they will then give all of that discount over to the customers who will flock in droves to the new platform in order to save money.
So simply: 1) sellers will rid themselves of the rent extractors and make massive amounts of cash from their newfound margins because 2) network effect of buyers is going to be driven by the massive discounts that buyers can now give such that their profit margins remain unchanged! This is the economic equivalent of believing in perpetual motion

The entire evaluation from OP is just false. It negates the fact that there are mining operations with large stores of cash that do not need to dump Bitcoins to pay for electricity. Basically, non-institutional miners need to get out because they can't afford mining.
Mining is commodotized - maybe the most commodetized - service ever developed. And what's great about the network is that it adjust the difficulty, so we don't need tons of miners to keep the network going; we need enough to keep things decentralized.

No it isn't. Money represents value. You have to represent it in some way. All you're advocating is that you get to pick a less efficient way of representing it. If you want to trade in furs, you still can. Paper money, fiat money, is one of the greatest innovations in history - as is credit. Pull your head out of Ludwig Von Mises' ass and take a look at the history of money. The Mississippi company is a great place to start. You'll probably get a glimpse at the world's first Bitcoiner in John Law. He innovated money by moving it from metal to paper. He then used the innovation to fund and run a scam. In the early days of paper money, Wildcat banks would issue local currencies. They would do things like locate their branches in way out of the way places, so that it was nearly impossible to ever actually convert the paper into metal. Notice, however, that these notes are liabilities. The bank issues a certificate that can later be redeemed for an asset. If you want to exercise your fundamental freedom of choice or conscience, then you can go and buy the debt of any corporation that you wish. It will be denominated in the common medium of exchange, the US dollar. But you will effectively be holding currency of any kind that you would like. You have perfect choice in this system. You can even be less sophisticated, if you'd like, and you can choose to interact in Amazon debt by buying their gift cards. This is a liability that can be redeemed for any of the commodities on Amazon's online store. It's a near perfect, fungible store of value. You don't know that because you haven't thought through this criticism save for what you have inferred from Bastiot.

Monetary inflation is uninteresting. Libertarians, in particular, like to claim that it is bad because it is bad. It is only "bad" in a world where price inflation becomes problematic.


Sure. So what? Again, this is a central libertarian thesis. How is it any different than just saying, "money funds wars?" Something has to fund wars. And maybe war is bad. We can probably all agree that we don't like it. But maybe war is also just a state of nature and you want to have wars do the least amount of harm. We can all shed a tear for the children in Iraq who die in war. But we also have to admit that casualties during war are way way down compared to what they were in, say, Gettysburg.


Simple. There are a lot of levers that cause inflation. Money printing is certainly one. Interest rates might be another. But a unforeseen plague that kills 10% of your population is also one. So is an attack on currency by foreign nationals who raise the price of resources. I think that the fed does a bang up job of managing all these concerns. You know who wouldn't? Your local currency-issuing bank.


I don't mean problem in the sense that you seem to mean it. I mean problem in that it is a concern with monetary policy. It is "foisted" on you because a little bit of inflation is good for the economy. You can't really have an opinion on inflation because you're basically not subject to it, a fact that we will get to in a bit.


You will only know if you did an adequate job defending it when you go to sell it. The fact that someone can show up at your house and break your legs to get your bitcoin is probably a systemic risk that you haven't considered that you are bearing. This is not a risk when you hold your money in a bank.


No you aren't. You're investing in a share of Apple stock and it's denominated in dollars.


This isn't the case. Without inflation, Apple's stock would probably be worth the same less the inflation. So you would, at the end, have a lower percentage increase (less money) and about the same purchasing power.


You haven't done the math on this. It's easy math to do. This is a Libertarian argument. Lucky for you, I did the math:  For those who don't want to read, the important bit is this:


Had you invested in gold 100 years ago and not stocks because of evil monetary inflation, you would have considerably reduced your purchasing power.


If this were true, it would also be true of Bitcoin which is most often denominated in dollars. The price of Bitcoin takes into consideration things like miner's unloading coins, but also the actual cost of inflation of the denominating currencies. IF this is true of Bitcoin, why would it not also be true of Apple stocks?
Libertarianism is an expensive ideology. You should do your best to bid it goodbye.

That's not true. Modernity has seen Greece default 5 times. This is the sixth. The did it 4 times in the 1800s, and 1 time in the 1900s. Most countries, save for something like 2 or 3 default with more regularity than you'd expect. There have even been long periods in history (as recent as the 1970s) wherein nearly half of the world was in a state of default. You should take a look at Rogoff's "This Time Is Different." It's a history of national default.
Relevant quote:


It's well worth the read. You'll find that there have been periods of history where more than 40% of the world lay in default. The US is one of only a few nations that has never defaulted or even de-fact defaulted through inflation. Also worth noting, from the same book:

This is 100% rhetorical blubber. This isn't true. You can literally discount the value of future inflation because the government tells you what they are targeting. Moreover, it's not that the value doesn't exist yet, it's that it 100% exists. You can see it. The value is tangible. You can see it in McDonald's $1 menus. You can see it in enormous, cheap televisions. You can see it in the incredible medical advances that America has pushed forward. Moreover, you can participate in the growth by investing in an all market index fund.

That's a question for McDonald's. But I bet there is a very very good reason. You can go ahead and try to find the missing €.29. My guess is it's in some tax/tarif, or in the geographic disparateness of Germany that doesn't. There is going to be something that 100% explains the price difference. You should also consider charting that price against inflation. I bet that €1.29 buys you more now than it used to. That increase will either match actual inflation or it will slightly outpace it. Regardless, I bet it's no more difficult to find €1.29 today than it was €1 whenever it was €1. The remarkable thing here is that you can get an entire day's calories for about €3-€4. And while that might have been pennies 100 years ago, my guess is it's easier to get people to part with €1 today than it was pennies 100 years ago.

Look, if you knew the answer to the question, you could be a billionaire. No one could have foreseen Google in 1992. We had webrings, and they were damn good - very effective at getting you to your content. Your question is begging, however. Your presumption is that Bitcoin needs or will be adopted en masse. The incentive for Bitcoin speculators is to pump, and want more users in the way that an MLM schemer wants more people to get in. But the Universe doesn't owe you that.
You should sit down, strap in, and just kind of let this ride happen.
In my not so humble, and always correct opinion, Bitcoin's core user group is the under-serviced: prostitutes without bank accounts, porn stars, drug dealers, people who need it for capital flight in countries where their currencies are being devalued by their governments (people can run miners in these countries to convert their money into energy which will give them Bitcoin at, what is probably, a slight loss that they consider to be less than the risk of holding their own fiat). Think of Bitcoin sort of like you might think of protein receptor. It works when it fits.
I think that this community has a tendency to jimmy it in to every nook and cranny. Bitpay is AMEX, but with the Bitcoin (it processes tiny numbers of transactions and is basically used to buy gift cards, which is why investors aren't getting their money back); Coinbase is a bank, but with the Bitcoin (this is why coinbase's users are likely almost exclusively speculators and not users - it will suffer if speculators quit, which is a hard bet); Rebit.ph is remittance but with the Bitcoin (it is as efficient or less efficient than Western Union); and OB will be Ebay but with the Bitcoin (you can apply your own intellectual considerations if you want to speculate on where that will go).
They do not have a permissionless marketplace, they have a marketplace that mimics the internet. So if you want me to equivocate on "who is making the android to bitcoin's linux," I would venture to guess that it is a company you have never heard of who will enter the ecosystem in 20 to 30 years time and do something more unexpected than you could have ever imagined, but it won't be OB. Asking that question right now is like asking who will make the Google of the internet in 1992 when the internet was nothing but porn, email didn't really exist in the way it exists now (you had Eudora and weird shit like that).
Scaling the internet was a ridiculous task. I remember in the early days, AOL melted down, and users left in droves because it couldn't handle the traffic and started to slow way way down. This is why when people talk about Bitcoin scaling, it's very clear to me that they do not remember the early days of scaling the web. It didn't happen overnight, it was incremental, and as it grew organically, so too, did the solutions for scaling. You need to service your existing users before you can start asking where this will go. And that is why the core devs are working so hard to keep Bitcoin decentralized at the expense (people here think) of obtaining new users.
Most users aren't users, they are speculators. Building Bitcoin for speculators at the expense of maintaining its only real, differentiating feature (uncensorable-ness) would be like saying that Linux is too hard to use, so in order to grow it, you need to make it look and act exactly like windows (including running windows programs). Good luck! Linux, by the way, didn't need a million people adopting it for it to be useful, it needed the right people to adopt it.
Also, it's worth noting, much of the speculation about Bitcoin is a bit absurd. No one ever said, "boy who will bring C++ to the masses?" Bitcoin, is a protocol. It's unsexy, it's not exciting, and I would be willing to bet that you will see an ecosystem of decentralized projects built on it that leverage it's only real, differentiating feature (uncensorable-ness). The tragedy of these projects is that they are altruistic. Unlike projects like Factom, Synereo, GetGems, Augur, or Dash's redirection of miner funds to developers all leverage tokens for the purpose of enriching the programmers who wrote them. While I understand the motivation for that sort of profit taking, that has never been the proposition that will work here.
Bitcoin was, is, and must always remain egalitarian. By the way, the tragedy of the commons that grows out of that egalitarianism might be its death. Satoshi mined because it was the only way to get it off the ground. The coins became valuable because people saw value in them. He built the protocol thanklessly. If it didn't work, his work was down the drain. The counterparty project did the same thing, to a large extent. The Drop Zone project (which is an actual decentralized market and a Bitcoin project because it's built on top of Bitcoin in its entirety) did the same thing.
So I guess the short answer to your question is that when someone builds an app that everyone finds useful, and everyone needs, and requires Bitcoin for everyone to use, that is when everyone will use Bitcoin. I wouldn't get your hopes up on that happening any time soon, and I wouldn't even go so far as to guarantee it will ever happen. But that is what Bitcoin will need if it's going to be adopted by the plebs.
For now, you can be satisfied that Libertarians will use it to buy bedsheets on Overstock out of principle. But in the spirit of the Holidays, I think the better thing to do, is simply be thankful that it is working, and if it doesn't work for anyone other than the people it is working for now, you can be proud of the fact that this community, you, me, and everyone here, have given those with no access to traditional markets or the money used therein the chance to participate and be treated with the dignity they deserve. That's about as far as I'll go about my motivations for being here.
But I would encourage you to examine your motivations if your goal is to bring Bitcoin to the masses without real consideration for what it might do to those that need it most. Because there is a strong chance that, in the short term, "bringing Bitcoin to the masses" will kill Bitcoin in the long term. Where, building Bitcoin for the use case(s) we know about and letting people come if it fits their Bitcoin shaped hole, is going to keep Bitcoin alive and useful. Pre-optimization is evil.

Man, people... you get like 90% there, and then... you get it wrong.
The blockchain is a tool for managing scarcity and settlement of that scarcity. Bitcoin will do the the remittance industry what Napster did to the music industry. But you have some levelling up to do here.
Scarcity comes in all forms, and value is contained within those scarce resources. The blockchain will allow for the remittance of scarce resources, such as World of Warcraft swords, in exchange for US Dollars, in exchange for S&amp;P 500 shares, in exchange for Bitcoin. All of that will be able to be accomplished on The Blockchain. You can have your global currency or whatever you want to call it... medium of exchange.... But Bitcoin manages the risk of settlement, and you that means you can settle a lot more than just Bitcoin.

No that's not what you were talking about. This is also not what happens. Slavery in Africa definitely still exists. You know where it doesn't exist? The US. Have you considered why? It's probably largely to do with progress. We have an economy that is more efficient without slavery.


Again, a complete conflation of the actual argument. Who cares who invented it? Again, the point is progress killed slavery. You're struggling here. Moreover, Sam didn't invent the Gin. His father invented a comb that Whitney mechanized. Again, not relevant.


Lol, no your mom didn't. Not without pay, she didn't. Unless you're 60 years old. Picking cotton is not slavery. Being owned by someone is. You're using highly emotional arguments to try to make a point and it's obviously disingenuous. I picked sugar beats, corn, and cabbage as a high schooler. Does that make me a slave? Or is there a distinction that we make between people that work on farms and slaves? Because I think that you have missed this nuance.

LMFTFY: If your ideology didn't cause you to believe that fiat was monopolized or that such a monopoly was bad, you wouldn't here because you can't conceive of why this would be interesting with the veneer of your stupidity.


Again, monopoly is used here for rhetorical effect. It's like calling the Social security system or money proper a "Ponzi."


Ok. And common sense says you will as well. The law doesn't mandate that you keep those fiat dollars. Only that you accept them at the point of sale. You will like that when you go to your bank, convert them into digital versions of that note, and then use that note to invest in something tother than the dollar.


Well, that's an egregious example... You don't have to accept it's value. The market sets its value. No one tells McDonald's they have to have a dollar menu. They did that on their own. You can delete your fiat at any time. That's what you did with Bitcoin... and look... no government told you you couldn't.


Isn't it good to be an American?


Ok, so now we're at the crux of it. You believe that America's responsible management of its monetary supply is causing inflation in Venezuela such that government officials are storing their wealth in the evil US dollar. It's a goddamn conspiracy. Again, you can't seem to disentangle your notion of slavery with inflation in the US. You're using it, again, for rhetorical purposes and not to bolster your point. Completely dishonest... again.


Yes, because we live in a global society. It's amazing though, our best trading partners are those with great economies. Venezuela is our 32nd largest trading partner and only $17MM/year come as agricultural imports. We send them $688MM in agricultural imports. So it seems like they benefit more from our progress than we do from this slavery you speak of. In fact, if you do the math, we're running a $671MM trade deficit with regard to agriculture with them. You can see these numbers for yourself on this government conspiracy website:  Your thesis is so stupid. It doesn't hold in the face of the most basic scrutiny.  I can't even confirm whether this slavery exists other than your assertive affirmations that it definitely does.


Welcome to real life. You have discovered that countries exist in a state of antagonism. A battle for resources and allocation of them is the history of earth. Yes, untold suffering has occurred. Thank God that progress has stamped much of that out. Your Luddism seeps through as you want to go back to simpler times when we kill Indians to take their land. The outcome of your belief is such a problem. You should want progression not regression. That said, I don't think you even know you're advocating regression.


You have stepped so far away from your original point. Your original point was that debt and inflation are slavery. Now that you realize how dumb and offensive that is, you're like doing a bunch of research on places slavery still exists. It's weird.

You're an Austrian. It's obvious. You probably think that the Libertarian label doesn't apply to you because you tell people in your personal life that you are an anarcho capitalist. What you don't know is that every Libertarian started calling themselves an ancap a few years ago. So... you're just another Libertarian.


You don't actually think this. Bastiat thinks this about taxes and modern Libertarians have extended this thinking to inflation. It is not theft. That's stupid and a completely false equivalency.


I thought you were trying to articulate how monetary inflation is bad. Now you are explaining why price inflation is bad. You don't have a very coherent thesis here. You really want to say that you believe inflation is bad. Your reason for thinking this is that you read it in a book - not that you have a good, coherent understanding of why it's actually bad.


Price inflation hurts the poor. Monetary inflation does not. I'm not the one trying to disambiguate these terms. But you certainly are. The reason the poor are hurt is because price inflation causes them to spend more on everyday goods. This increase is a higher percentage of their income. It is not because money is added to the supply.


So what? Every time you have an innovation in money, whomever is in control of lubricating the economy is going to have an incredible responsibility because they can take resources from other people using their value. Funding wars is a feature, not a bug. You want to add friction to the economy so that it's harder for governments to accomplish this. This would also add friction to your ability to spend, get credit, and the like.


Yes, you picked an extraordinary example - perhaps the most extraordinary in history. Rather than cherry picking, which is dishonest, you could actually take a look at the real data.  Deaths by war are down.


Thank you for clarifying that I was talking about the thing I said I was talking about. You don't know what monetary inflation is. You keep conflating it with price inflation. Disambiguation of these terms is dumb anyhow in a discussion of inflation. No one is talking about monetary inflation when they say inflation. They are always talking about price inflation, because that's the only one that anyone really cares about. Here, however, people like to squirrel out of the arguments by just pretending like they meant monetary inflation and expecting that the opponent doesn't have an answer. The only thing that matters here is how monetary inflation affects price inflation. You seem to think it does - and you would be right in the case of some currencies where debasement has occurred. But just because printing money is happening, it doesn't meant that price inflation is hugely affected. A great example is the great QE that you Libertarians love to pretend matters. There has been little to no price inflation (since you apparently require strict labeling lest your head explode) during the period of QE. So if there was no price inflation, but there was huge amounts of monetary inflation, can you explain to me who is hurt? Where was the theft? Purchasing power is the same. Or are you saying that there should have been some egalitarian way to have distributed that money? That's now how things work. But it's a cute argument to make that betrays a unprecedented level of concern trolling and virtue signaling.

It's not wrong. Greenspan's point is more nuanced than your Libertarian stupid will allow you to see. The US does, indeed have the ability to print as much money as it can. The chance of a strict default is, as he says, literally impossible though there have been times that it is politically more probable than others. Using the debt ceiling as a political football the last 12 years or so has brought us to the brink of disastrous default. In fact, this political brinksmanship is what he is literally commenting on. Printing money to oblivion has always been considered a defacto default by states. His commentary here has to do with the fact that disaster was coming as a result of the S&amp;P downgrade which came as a result of Standard's and Poor's doing an incorrect analysis of America's ability to pay its debt. When corrected, S&amp;P said that their math was wrong, and the US was well suited to take on its debt load, however, we were going to maintain the downgrade due to the political climate which they said they believed made it likely that default might occur. Can we avoid divorcing shit like this from context?

No, money funds wars. Inflation does not.


Now we're just saying words.


What? Borrowing is not disentangled from inflation. Inflation is a hard problem. And trust me, you like it.


No bro. Bitcoin is great. But for those with a lot of it, protecting their money is a literal full time job. Banks were created because no one wanted to hold their own value. Banks are an amazing invention of the modern age. Don't be Andreas Antonopoulos. These are such thoughtless points.


No one but an idiot "invests" in dollars. You can invest in companies. Your investment can be denominated in dollars. But let's not conflate the denomination with the medium of exchange. You haven't thought through this. In fact, I'd be willing to bet you denominate your Bitcoin investment in dollars. How is that different than investing in VTSAX? You aren't subject to inflation in either case, not in the way you mean you are.


Oh man. You are new here. Seizure isn't solved by Bitcoin. Denomination? Again, are you just writing words? Bitcoin can inflate as well. Right now, as the price of Bitcoin goes up against the dollar, we're in a period of deflation. When Bitcoin goes down, we are in a period of inflation. It's more complicated than that slightly, but not much more.

So, to that end, you're right, a "truly open, online market without trusted third parties to host or facilitate trade" has never existed. If you want to host your OB store on your computer, you can do that. But you've always been able to do that with websites. So if you can host your own website, and you can host your own OB implementation, then it would stand to reason that an e-commerce website and an open bazaar store are equally as "open," but one of them is definitely more "online" than the other, considering that OB is UDP and not http.
As far as facilitation goes, you don't need OB for that. Bitcoin is what solves that problem, not OB. Add a Bitcoin option to your home computer's implementation of Wordpress+Woocommerce, and you have the makings of the exact same kind of system.
Oh wait... from left field, completely forgot, there is a truly open, online market that has existed in usable form for quite a number of months now. Totally slipped my mind.

You have choice dumb dumb. You choose the US Dollar because it's most efficient. You can advocate anything you want. But you, yourself are making a choice based on efficiency, not on ideology, while advocating ideological choices. That's fine, but you look dumb wearing those pants.


Oh... wow... so maybe there is like... efficiency in having a regulated medium of exchange... whoa... surprise!


Yup... it's efficient like that.


Great! So now we can all play the same game on the same field. Amazing how commerce has advanced so.


It doesn't remove choice. I just articulated how you have choice. It's that the majority of people use the form of money that has the least amount of friction for the purpose of exchange. Guess what! That's the dollar!


That's just like your opinion man. There is no evidence to back up that opinion. Moreover, as I went through earlier, this isn't actually a monopoly in the traditional sense. The word is used by Libertarians for the purpose of inciting emotional reactions.


Obviously you don't care. You probably should though. Discounting history is fine. Dumb... but fine.

Counterfeiting is the act of making a fraudulent version of something. It is not the act of printing something you have the authority to print. You ask why I wrap Libertarian ideology with this argumentation, it's because they (you) throw in these asinine arguments that are completely indefensible. Printing money is not counterfeiting. Although, I know what you mean, because I've had this argument with Libertards many times in my life. What you mean is that because there is nothing backing the currency (intrinsic value argument) all money that is printed is fraudulent money because it does not represent an asset. Essentially, the counterfeit tort is against mother earth herself which provided unto us gold in the ground. This sort of stupidity is why Libertarianism needs to be addressed. It is a disease that blinds people to rational thinking.


Correct. Not all that relevant, but your point is well taken. In this instance, I'm being rhetorical. My critique is on the outrage. There is no tort here on any of you. You have not been wronged by the government's inflation. You can't really feel indignant about it. Moreover, the reason you're able to avoid it is a method whereby everyone is able to avoid it. So unless your an expert in how inflation works, I would stand by the fact that you can't really have a valid opinion on it.


Perhaps you have. I'm willing to bet you haven't.


Yes. It is. This is why people put high value items in safety deposit boxes. Also, it kind of isn't. A painting can go up in value, sure. But it's a single painting. W/ Bitcoin, you can stuff as much value onto a private key as you'd like. If you lose your private key, ALL the value disappears in an instant. This is not how other commodities work. The value density of Bitcoin things is essentially infinite, limited only by the value of Bitcoin. That's not the same as other things.


You're a Bitcoiner and a Libertarian with loud opinions. You probably have a neon glowing sign telling the whole neighborhood.


Oh man. "So too can my bitcoin be." Are you Yoda? Fucking high-fallutin sentence structures need to be done with. That aside, if you believe that to be true, then why don't you go ahead and insure your bitcoin. I can insure my money by walking to the bank and putting it in a bank account. Bitcoin's will necessarily have more friction to insure. And I'm willing to bet that it will be difficult for you as an individual to actually get them insured at all. Moreover, when was the last time you heard of someone insuring the cash under their mattress. Sounds like you are acting in a manner that is unbecoming of a holder of what you believe to be a currency.


How old are you? This is the stupidest thing anyone has ever written. I'm not even going to address it it's so stupid. I'll let you just kind of sit in your fart for a while.


Yes, it happens all the time. Apple does it. So do thousands of other companies. This isn't even related to any point anyone made.


You have to argue gold vs the stock market - because no one is going to hold a dollar bill for 100 years. Dollars aren't investments. Gold is an investment. This is where Libertarians go off the rails. This gold bug shit is so dumb. You are not missing the opportunity cost of holding gold vs a dollar which no one has ever held for 100 years unless they are a legitimate crazy. This is a question of opportunity cost against a benchmark. You can pick the dollar. That would be a dumb benchmark. You ought to pick a benchmark that actually gives you a perfect understanding of the actual opportunity cost of your choice. So no, you didn't do the math. In order to spend that gold, you still have to convert it to fiat - kind of like every other investment.


What is the example you gave?


I don't think you know what you agreed to there. This is as dumb as your point about Apple stocks which you believe would appreciate faster if denominated in Bitcoin than if they were denominated in dollars. I think your designation as a layman economist is generous, and self-given. I don't think you have much of an idea how these things work. That's 101.


You don't believe that. You're here to get rich. You believe that Bitcoin will be highly volatile to the moon. Bitcoin has proven a terrible store of value with its ups and downs.


You'd have to be an idiot to hold fiat as a store of value. The government has promised that it will devalue it to encourage investment. As a reaction to this promise to make your money worth less, the government has driven you into Bitcoin. Do you see the irony here? The government is asking you to invest your money to create value in other segments of the economy. Your so enraged at their request, that you decided to show the government whose boss and used your hard earned dollars to invest your money in other segments of the economy. Amazing how it works. If you really wanted to stick it to the big cheese, you'd do nothing with your money. You'd pull it out of banks, you'd rent a storage unit and start filling it pallets of dollar bills. Show Uncle Sam whose boss. Don't participate in the economy. That seems to be what you think you're doing now. It's laughable that you can't see that you're literally doing what the government asked you to do. Kind of sad that you can't see it.


If you stop making Libertarian points, I will stop bringing up your Libertarianism... sorry, anarcho-capitalist beliefs.

An audit is kind of a dumb idea. The Bitcoin foundation is not a community org. They served a purpose, paid people to go to conferences in the early days, paid core devs, and were largely funded by early guys many of whom would be complicit in any wrongdoing in the event an audit showed nefarious activity. Most of the people in this sub did not give to the foundation (I'm willing to bet). The foundation ought to simply shutter, and be a forgotten relic of Bitcoin's early past. What would you do if you found wrongdoing anyhow? Claw back the money? You won't be able to.
Moreover, the audit would go to satisfy the 16 y/o neckbears on r/bitcoin who would complain that anyone had a salary north of 40k because they think that's a lot of money.

If everything I said is true, than this can't be true. Printing of money is one of the most transparent actions that the government undertakes. If the information is near perfect, "distortion" is nearly impossible. You choose to use the word "monopoly" because of the incredible negative emotions it stirs. But it clearly isn't a Monopoly strictly. Money isn't a commodity as such nor is it a good. Money represents value. There are hundreds of countries competing to represent value most efficiently. You can choose to use any of those representations. Most people use the one that is most easily spent in their near vicinity. The next question would be which of those moneys would you prefer to hold? The answer is probably USD. And again, you can hold any kind of money you want. You can hold Goldman Sachs debt, if you'd like. So let's not pretend that there is anything like a monopoly here. That's completely disingenuous.

God you're an idiot. You wrote:


Slavery is a horrible evil. It just is. You're the one saying that debt and slavery are the analogous. Learn to confront your own arguments. It will make you a more honest person. You're now claiming that you were just making an abstract claim that because of the current economic system, in Africa there are slaves. That wasn't what you were saying. You're just dishonest. That's fine, but it's stinky.


No inflation is a matter of fact. You advocate what? Deflation? 0% inflation? The 2010 Libertarian is back in Bitcoin apparently. Welcome to stupid mountain. The notion that slavery exists has nothing to do with the question at hand. The intellectual sommersaults you've had to commit to in order to make this recent argument is laughable. Slavery doesn't exist because the Fed inflates the USD - nor was that what you were asserting originally. This is what we call moving the goal post. You are incapable of arguing a linear point.


Why don't you explain this? It makes absolutely no sense, and I think you pulled it out of your prison wallet. None of this follows from the former point. If I'm following you, you're saying that inflation exists, somehow, inflation creates a value gap that causes people to be employed. Because people are employed, you believe that that necessitates a statistically significant portion of of those people will necessarily be doing work for free because of the law of large numbers. I think this is what you're trying to say. If it is, that's idiotic. If you're trying to say something else, then you should string together a coherent set of words that form a thought.
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:55:41
I'm definitely an idiot. But you didn't start doing that until I pointed out the problem with your disgusting analogy. Also, ad hominums are perfectly acceptable when employed judiciously. I'll gladly take any you dish out.


"We" aren't. This is called a political football. Your the one who is claiming that the fed is manipulating the currency. To simultaneously believe that the fed is manipulating the currency, and that China has a special place in this argument, is at the very least intellectually dishonest. But cognitive dissonance has been the name of this argument. So I guess I can see how you believe both things.


He's a Libertarian. This post is stupid. And I pretty deftly explained why.


This is a re-casting of your actual point, and it is non-sensical. You re-cast it because comparing the debt created in the making of fiat to slavery is obviously dumb. You have pivoted to this point simply stated: inflation in the United States is why cacao farming in East Africa uses slave labor sometimes. That's a pretty funny pivot. Also, a tacit acknowledgement that you're original point was incorrect.


Yes. I do. I've ben trying to be dense and obtuse this entire argument. Sadly, I haven't been able to outdo you.


I didn't argue it was good for America. I argued that you aren't affected by it and you don't understand it. In either case, your pivot is obvious.


I mean, if someone wants to read your comment, it's just above. I don't think that one can divorce context from a quote that is literally 10 lines up. That said, for your sake, we can post your whole quote, since you believe that readers are too dumb to use their scroll bar. Here is what you said:


I responded to it with the following:


You then pivoted, made an appeal to emotions by claiming your mother was a slave, and then said that the entire crux of your argument was actually that inflation causes slavery in Africa today. I don't know how much less obtuse I can be than to literally repeat your arguments back to you.

You learned that rule in third grade. It's a dumb rule rooted in the Latin obsessed 19th century grammar wars. If you'd like to nitpick English, you should probably acquire a better grasp on the rules your discussing. At least select mistakes that are actual mistakes. Or do that clever thing dumb people like to do when insulting their oponent by adding a [sic] in the middle of a sentence they have discovered a mistake in. Oops, did it again with the preposition. The [sic] thing is especially painful because it tells the reader that you noticed the mistake but you are such an honest person you have ensured that his original text remains intact. All the while, you will insult the author by pointing out that you are a bit more pedantic than he is. He will will give you a commensurate hurrah when he can't be specific about what he dislikes withing your argument. You will be proud. And when you die, you meet st Peter who will ask whether you ever ended a sentence in a preposition. You will say, "of course not, now let me in." And he will send you to hell for your stupidity.

Owning the network has no carrying risk. No one "allows" anything on the internet either. But you're lying about no one "controlling the listing." The owner of the market controls the listing.
As you said: "Now, it's not being built specifically for contraband, so there's no IP address obfuscation (Tor or I2P). If you list something illegal then the government could subpoena your ISP, come to your house and arrest you and shut down you computer. Your computer hosts your store so if you're arrested your store is gone (though if you're arrested it hardly matters, does it?)." Which is exactly how it works on the internet, which goes to my point, you have built a shitty version of the internet.
DZ isn't another Silk Road either. It is a permissionless marketplace. You have just confirmed the biggest critique I regularly make, that you have built a shitty version of the internet. The reason has nothing to do with Drop Zone. The reason Drop Zone matters is because it is a permissionless marketplace.

It's always been toxic muyuu. You know that. Blockchains are war. Toxicity is layer one. Layer two is Libertarians. They provide the payment channels wherein the toxicity can be used. Layer 3 are the users like prostitutes and drug dealers. They are served by layer 1 and 2 but know nothing about the politics or the poison of layer 1. They just know that they can pay for their ads on backpages. Layer 4 is Blythe Masters and factom who provide an impenetrable regulatory shield that is doing its best to build broad regulation for MYSQL databases. They are promoting magical thinking about how Blockchain can do anything. This sends regulators in all directions trying to make sure that Blockchains don't become sentient. Layer 5 is Ethereum and Doge coin which lets n00bs practice blockchaining without pooping on Bitcoin. Layer 6 is Roger Ver who runs about screaming that there are hoardes of Hobbits at the gates of Moria wanting to get in to the cave filled with trolls. He is providing shield for Layer 5 which is actually where the Hobbits enter, and it is absent of trolls. Rather, layer 5 is filled with farts. These farts are the fuel of speculative inflows into Bitcoin.
This synergism is called Byzantine Fault Tolerance. Every blockchain needs all 6 of these elements to function. This is how we know that Ethereum isn't a blockchain. It is layer 5, not layer 1. Toxicity is not in its fundamental layer. They are running on compassion. They will need to be replaced as the layer 5 infrastructure as soon as they begin using POS. Perhaps ETC will become layer 5. In any case, layer 5 is a drop in.

Lol. No the jury isn't still out. There are claims about what they do. But i haven't heard any honesty about it. There is no good example of what you need turing completeness for. We have a number of smart contracts built into the bitcoin network. And as we need more, the core devs will build them. But externalizing the process of building them, making the load of any idiot's code endemic to the chain is nonsense unless there is even one compelling use case. In fact you probably need several more than 1 to make it worth the chain weight. But you haven't even thought of a single use case, so let's start there. To the blockchain argument, it's won. People are now finally admitting that their "blockchains" are just database with a blockchain sticker. Others are getting out of the space entirely. Are you new here?

Hey frankenmint. So that's the Ruby client. Max gave a great little explanation of how to install that here:  That is a commandline client.

You would put this in the header: '&lt;script src="dropzone-lib.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;' and use the calls on that page to implement on your own site if you wanted to make a chat client for example or if you wanted to implement a block explorer that served Drop Zone encoded transactions in a special way.

Permissionless is the only efficiency of blockchains. OB isn't permissionless. If you want to setup a website selling illegal goods, you can. The risk is in holding the data for marketplace. OB has you hold all the data. It's shitty shopify because you are hosting your own store on your own computer. You want to do that with a website? I think not.

This is what HTTP does. But it's more flexible and extensible.


You can use Bitcoin on your website too.


This isn't true either. The notion is that you can just get on with an internet connection. The truth is, that you need a constant internet connection that is reliable and has enough bandwidth to support browsing of your store. The reason this is required is because OB isn't actually decentralized. The protocol, like any protocol, might be decentralized. The stores themselves, they are self-hosted, like a website.


A middleman is someone who provides an efficiency in the market. OB itself is a middleman. It might be a cheaper middleman, but I doubt it. This entire project is predicated on the notion that middlemen are rent extractors. This isn't the case. Middlemen are not rent extractors they are efficiency creators.


So you are making the claim for sellers that it will end in them making more money. And then to buyers you are telling them "OpenBazaar has discounts on products and I don't need to turn over my personal data to a company to use it." So your assumption is that any gains made by the sellers will be immediately passed on to buyers. I'm willing to bet that's not the case since it would invalidate your claim to sellers.

Libertarian talking point.


Vociferous assertion with no basis.




Assertion rooted in unstated ideology wherein you apparently are now of the belief that wealth ought to be egalitarianly distributed based on merit, which stands against everything everyone believes in property rights since the only way to remediate this sort of assertion is through governmental redistribution (you didn't think that through).


Another assertion with no consideration. This makes no sense. It absolutely communicates value.


Most modern economists agree that actual interest rates are almost completely divorced from the Fed's actions. So this is probably false.


If you believe in efficient markets (which most people claim to), then you have to believe that the interest rates have almost no effect on actual prices. Prices adjust in the face of interest rate modifications.

Giving actual information probably means beating them over the head with it relentlessly because... they won't get it. Telling n00bs about Bitcoin looks like this:
"Hi, I'm a n00b, I'd like to spend my entire life savings on a Bitcoin mine."
"No, n00b, please don't do that."
"Why not? Bitcoin is money you can print for free on your free money making computer!! Didn't you know that? I thought you were the Bitcoin expert. Maybe I know more than I thought I did."
"Bitcoin costs money to print because energy is not cheap."
"I have free energy."
"Umm... where?"
"My apartment's utilities are included."
"Oh, ok, so you're going to steal energy from your landlord who will pay for it?"
"It's not stealing. He included it in the rent."
"I don't care what you call it, the court will probably decide it's stealing."
"Courts have no power here, I am a Bitcoiner. I am printing money with my eternal money making printing machine which I bought at 321-Super-Obvious-Cloud-Mining-Scam.co.io.biz."
"Oh, so you aren't even going to buy a miner?"
"Why would I need to when I can cloud mine?"
"Oh... umm, are you holding the private key for the keys that you have generated at 321-Super-Obvious-Cloud-Mining-Scam.co.io.biz?"
"What's a private key? They give me a login, I just go in there and see how much I've made. I'm making like 30% per day over what I put in. That's why I'm putting in the rest of my savings."
"You shouldn't do that. You're going to get scammed."
"Hahaha, you don't know that. You can't know that. I've been making 30% per day, and you think it's a scam. People said the same thing about Bitcoin back in the day, and look at what that returned."
"Umm... yeah... but Bitcoin is a different kind of technology. You're just giving your money to a dude changing the amount of money you're making on a database somewhere. Bitcoin is a decentralized network. By the way, if you don't understand what a private key is, you probably shouldn't be investing yet."
"Why? It's so easy, all I have to do is make an account on a website, and they can hold my coins."
"By the way, I just started a bitcoin business."
"Oh God, no."
"Yeah, I'm a Bitcoin consultant. I'm going to go around to local businesses, and help them get setup to accept Bitcoin."
"Oh my God, this is a fucking hamster wheel. Everyone does this. What you'll find out is that no one uses Bitcoin, so no business owner will keep on accepting it unless they are ideologically aligned with you, in which case they already accept it."
"You probably did it poorly."
"No, everyone else, all thousand million people who came before you did it poorly also. Bitpay did it poorly and they had millions to burn."
"Who is Bitpay?"
"Oh my God."
"Look, we're in a bar right now that doesn't accept Bitcoin. I'll just go to the owner, tell them that if they accept Bitcoin, at the end of the night I will buy it from them at the exchange rate we agree to at the beginning of the night. See? No risk for him, only upside."
"No bar owner is going to accept that. They don't want to be running an exchange, or making sure they are here to negotiate your Bitcoin price. They just want to accept the payments that they have signed up for."
"Why are you even here if you are so pessimistic about Bitcoin?"
"I'm not a pessimist, I just understand what it does. It isn't a silver bullet."
"Bitcoin is going to change the world."

So the problem that Blockchains attempt to solve is a problem called the Byzantine General's problem. You probably know this, but let's start at the beginning for those that don't. There have been thousands and thousands of proposed solutions to this problem in computer science over the years. In the 90s, Microsoft even put together a proof that showed that the problem was impossible to solve via computer science means. The simple 1-sentence description of the BG problem is the answer to the question: "how do you prevent data from being corrupted in a network where there are nodes that have (economic) incentive to lie about the data." In Bitcoin, if you can lie about the state of the ledger, you will be a very rich person. There is a lot of technical nuance left out of my description of the problem. But it should satisfy the purpose of this discussion.
The PoW solution takes the solution outside the realm of pure computer science and establishes the problem as a computer science + economics problem. You can thank Adam Back  for that, by the way. The introduction of PoW as we see it in Bitcoin is the extenuation of Back's proposal, who proposed that producing hashes had actual economic value by recognizing that a tiny tiny tiny amount of computer power had to be contributed to produce valid hashes. What Adam missed in the hashcash implementation that Bitcoin resolved is the fact that a pure hashing protocol has no ability to scale as computers become better. Real simple, while hash production does cost resources (electricity), as computers get better and better the production of valid hashes approaches 0 (it's an asymptote). Bitcoin lets the hash value scale with computational improvements. As computers get better, more hashing happens. The result is not a more secure blockchain, it's a blockchain that scales with technological improves making Bitcoin as secure today as it was a week ago or a year ago. For me, this means that I am far less excited by increases of hashpower. That will happen for the rest of Bitcoin's history, as the protocol scales continuously with Moore's law. It also means that you can not hash on one blockchain without consequence to another because while the protocols may be different, and the algorithms for hashing may be different, the resources consumed are real. A miner cannot double spend his real world resources to hash on two chains. This fact means that PoW blockchains are war.
PoS, on the other hand, criticizes the necessity of having real-world resources to solve the problem. There are numerous problems with PoS that you can read about. They are most eloquently outlaid in Poelstra's paper which he has updated over the years. But just an examination of the proposal of PoS should be enough to make you scratch your chin. PoS traditionally reduces PoW to computer science. It removes the economic inputs that are required to have solved the BG problem. This is known as the "Nothing at stake" problem. Many have trivially solved this problem requiring that people stake UTXOs to be honest. In the event that they are honest, they get their money. If they are dishonest, they lose their money. So this, at least, recognizes that the BG problem has economics concerns. What it doesn't do, however, is recognize that the burning of energy is the simplest way to stake resources. As such, these protocols operate under the assumption that attacks against the protocol are mitigated internally by the protocol itself. So far every single one of these proposed solutions has been subject to short, medium, and long range attacks of varying sorts that can be carried out by expending real world resources. NXT and Ripple, for example, suffered stake grinding attacks. I'm not sure what Ripple did (I'll have to do some research), but NXT fought those attacks by obfuscating their consensus code.
What this means is that PoS is usually reducible to inelegant Proof of work. The consensus can be exploited by someone willing to actually spend the resources. And, like ASIC boost, a lot of these attacks can be carried out unbeknownst to the users. You should recognize that in "Blockchain" you own your coins probabilistically. While Bitcoin is a settlement engine, it is probabilistic settlement. The more time that goes on, the more you probably own your coins. The goal of a blockchain should be to increase the probability that this statement is true. While Bitcoin allows you to know with near absolute certainty that you own your coins in just 6 or 7 blocks, if a consensus protocol is given to long range attacks, that are trivially obfuscated, you might find that your coins are not absolutely yours for 6 or 7 months. Moreover, if there are PoW attacks that can be carried out on PoS chains, then, very simply, even if the coins are yours, the mining algo is broken. It means that PoS is an attackable protocol that is waiting for the next attack iteration which it will have to respond to in the way that Google responds to ranking manipulation. With Bitcoin, the problems are things like ASICboost, which isn't an economic code problem. It's a problem with SHA2. The economics are such that once discovered, it now behooves every miner to use ASIC boost. So sites like  which state "AsicBoost is a patent-pending method to lower your total cost per Bitcoin mined by approximately 20%" don't understand that the hashing will just scale to match the cost of mining. All that ASIC boost will do is increase the hashpower on the network making the network exactly as secure as it was before ASIC boost, making sure that anyone who exploited the advantage to make money will have their advantage reverted to the mean. This sort of self-healing isn't possible in PoS unless... of course... we agree... that PoS usually is reducible to simple, inelegant PoW. And if that's true, then that means that the premise of the question which (I assume) is why we don't use the more efficient consensus protocol in the making of a blockchain, is a dumb question. Because all that will happen in a world where PoS is inelegant proof of work is that you'll have exactly the same real-world costs associated with PoS, and you'll have far less transparency than exists in a simple PoW scheme like exists in Bitcoin.
TL;DR: The reason to use PoW instead of PoS is because PoW has little to no attack surface, whereas PoS is just PoW but end-runs PoW's simplicity and exchanges it for Rube Goldberg like complication for no reason other than to prevent you from understanding how real resources are going to be expended in ensuring consensus.

smart contracts can use any kind of oracle. Human oracles included. Generally people have discussed the need for multiple oracles in case one goes rogue. But if you say the oracle could be a computer program that someone is in control of, that is effectively the same as an individual person. They can still go rogue. What you want is someone whose economics is tied to being dishonest. Should they violate that honesty without recompense, it will be expensive for them (like they might go bankrupt kind of expensive). You're 100% correct that a majority of users don't believe smart contracts must escrow value. But I am 100% correct about that. If it doesn't escrow value, then it's not a smart contract. Those people are the people you should instantly discredit.

@_date: 2016-11-07 07:15:16
No one said smart contracts had to be "turing complete." In fact that makes no sense. Turing completeness is an attribute of programming languages. It is not an attribute of smart contracts. I don't know what the official definition is, but I can tell you what I think a smart contract is. A smart contract escrows value. It relies on an oracle that has the ability to release the escrowed value to one or more parties. They are held together by economics, meaning that it should cost more to break a smart contract than is held in the contract. This doesn't have to be the case, but as was the case with the DAO, if it is not, exploitation of the contract will be both feasible and expected. This definition means multisig is a smart contract. It means that CLTV is definitely a smart contract. It also means that being a smart conteact does not necessitate the use of a blockchain.

RSK can't get merged miners. That's an idiotic proposition. It won't happen. Federated pegs for security are stupid, also. I'm not positive, but I believe that RSK uses the federated proposition in order to function. If all the nodes went down, it would cease to exist. That's unlike counterparty, for example, which uses the nodes for indexing, but continues to exist even if no one is hosting the nodes. Moreover, the nodes can be hosted by anyone - no potting ceremony. The security of a product like Counterparty is the security of Bitcoin. There are other systemic threats to that project. But in the case of RSK, it is completely dependent on miners making the poor economic decision to mine on the RSK sidechain. Moreover, the federated node structure is going to be ridiculously centralized.
I think they say that global organizations like the IMF are going to host these nodes. Tell me how long you think they will run a node when they find the primary use case for smart contracts, so far, is writing contracts that function as Ponzi games. What would the IMF do if they were hosting an application with a security hole like the DAO? Explain to me how this will work. Because I see the ending here being much more embarrassing than ETH.
By the way, it's disingenuous to say that they are running on the security of the Bitcoin network. It's just false. It's a small fraction of the Bitcoin network because you will likely have only irrational (ideological) miners merge mining.

@_date: 2015-08-17 05:30:16
I put it in a document and posted it on Twitter my friend. Nowhere else.
Regarding the article, you are further digging yourself a hole and blatantly lying. It's ridiculous to make claims on the internet that can be instantly disproven. The Reuters article, which can be found here:  says the following in its very first sentence: "Honduras, one of the poorest countries in the Americas, **has agreed** to use a Texas-based company to build a permanent and secure land title record system using the underlying technology behind bitcoin, a company official said late Thursday."
Furthermore, Factom ran the statement on its own, official blog which can be found here:  "Honduras, one of the poorest countries in the Americas, has agreed to use a Texas-based company to build a permanent and secure land title record system using the underlying technology behind bitcoin, a company official said late Thursday."
 I'm very ok with you lying. But please make sure to continue doing it in a way that is very simple for me to reveal to the world how deluded you are. It makes it much easier to have these sorts of discussions.

Yes, it's obviously something that needed to be fixed. Everyone agrees that at some point it should be fixed. Gavin made everyone decide it needed to be fixed now. It is a great example of people not thinking for themselves. Look, you guys have done amazing work. What I'm bothered by is the way this whole proposal was done. Asking Reddit to equivocate on the issue was in disgusting taste.
I know the core devs have been thinking about scaling. I am so thankful that you guys have been working on that. I don't like the "high tech lynching" that has occurred here wherein Gavin and Hearn have decided to take the matter public which is aggravating. My statement about "no one caring about it" was about the priority of random Redditors not core devs. Yes, the core devs have been working toward scale ever since the beginning of Bitcoin. Redditors didn't know to care for the most part until Gavin and Hearn told them to.
EDIT: Didn't realize I was talking to maaku7. Thought it was a random Redditor. (Sorry)

You have such a bad history of standing up for bad peojects Bruce. My favorite to date is when you kept saying the paycoin accusations were unfounded. I think its time for you to shut your yap and play in your freemason sandbox on your private island alone. You should consider reducing your "reasonable" toned defense of idiot projects. Also, you have some claims we can examine here:
"He explained complex stuff with ease"
Which complex stuff?
"There are many damn good CEOs who actually speak quite simply about things or mess up in interviews... "
"Anyone who has done lots of interviews has had this come up....you feel stumped on something and then later realize that either you didn't really understand the question or the interviewer didn't understand the context or both."
He didnt later clarify the answers, so now that he has seen himself, what are the answers to this question?
"There are CEOs, right in this space, who even after thinking about a question....for weeks...still can't do things as basic as articulate what the business does, what problem it solves or how it makes money."
Uhh, which companies? Which CEOs? Are any of them not scams? This is a huge problem for a company and i suspect that you are making it up.

 I think that's what we call historical revisionism. And you're also wrong about Moe. You were there, you saw the massive paycoin logos on all the walls. You saw Garza at the party surrounded by bodyguards. Moe took what was obviously blood money. Yermack of y/bitcoin did the same thing for his subsequent issue. And you showed up at a thread where people were gathering pitchforks and told them that the evidence wasn't in, and we needed to hear the scammer speak. Then Garza duped you when he said he would speak then didn't. You're probably a large part of the reason that his sponsorship went forward.

Joey, every time you speak, i become evermore convinced that you have spent about 8 minutes sussing this idea out. Should you begin to be used as an oracle there will be significant financial stake in making the prediction market lie. And since prediction markets are fairly shallow, making the market lie will be a simple attack. Moreover, you talk about BTC sidechains, but have never given any indication of how you would go about securing your project's side chain. This makes me suspect that you are either saying side chain to appease bitcoiners with no intention of building it on a sidechain, or you dont know how sidechains work on some level. Finally, the whole btc is hard to develop on is true. Get over yourself. It is lazy to program something that requires immutability on a project that has 0 evidence it will be immutable.
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:15:41
That's not correct. Your presumption is that the financial gain from this attack would be endogenous to the market. Say in the case that someone has bet on an outcome and the oracle for that outcome is the Augur system. My point is that because there is no liquidity in prediction markets, it is generally more profitable to bribe the oracles. Moreover, in a system where oracles gain from telling truth, and truth is determined by that which the oracles agree on, it is more beneficial in your system to respond to external incentives en masse than to assume that no one will. Otherwise, it is likely that you will give good answers to a group of people who are bribed which will cause good actors to be punished.

So u/joeykrug, as I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong, you have an oracle system that gives users scores for their correctness right?
So couldn't you have a very simple to orchestrate attack where an user who stands to make... say... a million dollars on the outcome being the opposite result, bribe the oracles with a 500k payout in a smart contract system iff they cause the result to be incorrect?

I certainly don't have any information on this. I was just shocked! But you have offices in Paris. So if you are in a major city, and your offices are like 2500 square feet, I'm guessing you pay about $4k or $6k/month USD. The justification of that sort of cost indicates to me that for a giant sized place like that you probably pay like $400-600/month if it's really as subsidized as you say. And San Francisco, I wouldn't be surprised if you pay between 4k and $12k per month.
I just have trouble wrapping my mind around the possibility of throwing between $8400 and $18,400 out of the window every single month in a startup. It screams bubble.

@_date: 2015-07-14 12:25:59
Haha. You actually do.
I'm not usually a proponent of blockchain all the things. But this is the exactly perfect use of a Blockchain. I needed a way to trade the cards with someone I didn't know without having to trust them. You can accomplish that in a few ways, but not without intermediaries. Like I could have sold the card on ebay, they could have paid with paypal, and I could have sent the card to them once I receive the payment. This works because I trust myself. But what if I'm untrustworthy. I don't send the card, but only take the payment. Now the other person has the ability to get his money back by begging Paypal. But you couldn't do a negotiated swap across borders without both parties trusting both each other and a third party.
This literally had 0 need for trust. You couldn't accomplish it any other way. I didn't even need to trust any courier of any kind.
Also, we exchanged trading cards. I gave them a card, they gave me a card. The person I ultimately traded with was in Finland. How else would you do this?

Tbh, it's a good reminder that we're still "early days." If you listen to the media talk about Mt. Gox, it's like it happened a century ago. they talk about how it happened in the early days of Bitcoin. While it will always be weird sounding to us... the fact is... it probably did. you will, no doubt remember the hundreds of exchanges that went belly up and many community scandals that occurred long before the Gox.

The product is made to be as big as a credit card so that it can be conveniently stored... IN YOUR WALLET!
IMO, there are a lot of problems with this hardware wallet. 1) 2G - 2G connections are set to sunset as a usable network next year. Very few companies will continue to support it which means your Case will be bricked almost as soon as it ships. 2) It is a fragile piece of equipment. 3) It's price point is out of line. 4) I'd be surprised if it's hardware (such as it's fingerprint scanner) are any good at all. 5) Everyone is making a hardware wallet which means that it's a Bitcoin idea whose time has come, and those never make money. 6) They have a team of something like 13 people to develop this piece of hardware. How the fuck do they afford that? They are burning a minimum of $500k/year presuming that those people are paid any kind of reasonable salary. 7) They are both a hardware and software company. This almost never works. 8) They are holding a key. Why is this stupid? Well, since it's a multisig, it seems to me, you could use your phone as the "biometric" multi-sig wallet without sacrificing anything. Doing that would allow you to trust your hardware, and would allow you to innovate on the software. Why would I pick Case over Airbitz? THe answer is, I almost certainly wouldn't because 1) I trust Airbitz more, and 2) I don't need a new device.

David, Paycoin was a giant scam and it was obvious. I remember telling you after you had run the issue that it as an obvious scam, and the article you put in the magazine was a terrible shill-y article because it was disguised as journalism, but was just a letter written by Garza about how Paycoin did what Bitcoin does. Your response: "I'm pretty sure that Paycoin isn't a scam." So yes, it will definitely happen again, but I don't think you can take credit for trying very hard to prevent it.

You're 100% right. I think that was the intention of the question. I remember thinking that the kid was just a cray cray when this happened. And while the weird is pouring from his mouth, there is so much interesting that is in his statement that I didn't see years ago. The religious overtones of Bitcoin are incomparable. You're absolutely right as well about what I think his question actually was.
Bitcoin's evangelism is interesting too, by the way. I was raised Evangelical, and even grew up on a Christian commune among missionaries. Think about the notion of missions. You leave your home, you go out, you tell people that you have some valuable secret. It's so similar to what you do when you tell people about Bitcoin. The difference is that when you give them some Bitcoin at the end, when you transact with people, you are actually transmitting them literal value. In Christianity, that would be when you give to them Jesus. In Bitcoin... it's when you download Mycelium to their phone and send them some $$$$.
It also illustrates that Bitcoin screws with your head. You come here a normal person, you leave unable to speak to people who live in the real world.

I never discussed local bitcoins.
The reason that local bitcoins doesn't work as a risk mitigation tool is because the deliverer of the good generally reveals themselves. Just because your exchanging in bitcoin doesn't mean that you are doing regulatory arbitrage. However, in instances where the supply chain  deliverer doesn't need to reveal themselves to the recipient, this is where regulatory arbitrage can be assisted by the blockchain. This is probably why a decentralized Uber will not gain efficiencies when built on the Blockchain. The driver has to show the end user who they are (recipient of service meets the service provider).
Remittance, however, is perfect for this because remittance is one-way. It involves a sender and a receiver, and the receiver is not required to pay back the sender. The directionality of this transaction allows for the supplier to not reveal themselves to the recipient, thus rendering any regulation moot and the risk of participating in that economy mostly riskless.

1. 100%. Yes, it can. This is an integrated library, so you could build a store that lets you show woocommerce items as well as items that you (or someone else) has listed in the blockchain.
2. GUI is coming. I think that a WP plugin will probably have to be the work of someone else, but it is absolutely possible for someone to implement, and if there are enough users interested, it might be something that we as a team consider contributing code to.
Frankly, if someone wants a really simple idea that they can build right now, implementing local bitcoins on DZ would be both simple and very lucrative if done right.

The proof-of-work mechanism is required in order to make something a blockchain datastructure my dopplegangery friend. As you point out, there is a difference between Bitcoin and git. The difference is the introduction of dynamic membership multi-party signatures that sign off on valid work that is done. If you believe that git is a blockchain, rather than something that is merely analogous to the blockchain, then the next thing to examine is why you believe this Bitcoin thing is important at all. Proof-of-work is not merely a spam filter. It is the security of he network.
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:57:52
So that's not the case either. You simply need to write a smart contract external to the system whose rules indicate that the bet must end at x result in order for the money to then be dispersed. The oracles do not need any guarantees than that it's written in he blockchain.

@_date: 2018-03-02 20:03:28
Because the belief system ascribed to by Libertarians is one of moralization. It's a with us or against us philosophy. There is no internal consistency to modern Libertarian thought. And that means that almost anything can be justified. There is also a strong component of entitlement. Anyone who disagrees is a person who stands in the way of what one is entitled to.
"The fed is evil" is a mantra that is employed by Libertarians and in exchange for the accusation, Libertarians believe that the entire economic infrastructure should burn to the ground. Then they, holding gold (and now Bitcoin even though Libertarians - particularly Misens - used to look down on BTC), will be victorious and wealthy in the great reboot. The hope is that everyone else will be impoverished. The economics of modern Libertarianism become hugely problematic when you understand the history of things like the gold standard. The gold standard is a unspecific talking point. Libertarians use the word so that they don't have to talk about the specifics of their belief in a gold standard. What is a gold standard? Is it that a specific amount of money will back each unit of currency? Is it that a unit of currency will fluctuate with regard to its backed unit? As in is the currency floating and gold static? What happens if the gold monopolizes all the gold and a market price becomes difficult to actual come to because there isn't enough on the market since states are hoarding it? This is actually what ended the gold standard. It nearly bankrupted the US as we liquidated gold to provide market access. So then we move to silver. The problems with metals is that a lot of metals have extra-currency uses. The second best use of the metal isn't actually to be used as currency. It's to be used in industrial production. More than that, you need enormous amounts of a metal to describe all the value in the world. The problem is that there is more value in the world that needs to be articulated than can be articulated with gold or silver or bronze. The world is way more nuanced and monetary systems more complex than modern Libertarians can fathom. The humor of the gold collection is that a huge portion of the profit comes from states profiting on Libertarian beliefs about state confiscation. The state confiscated gold in the 20s to prevent the US from bankruptcy. When we got off the gold standard, we minted coins to sell to ideologically stupid people who believed that gold was going to be confiscated again. The seigniorage on those coins is enormous. And libertarians buy them from the state in order to profit from the state when it collapses. The state knows this, so they continue to sell those coins at a hilariously high profit. This is the tax for believing in conspiracies. It is the Libertarian version of the state-run lottery.
The philosophy ignores actual monetarists like Keynes because they have wholesale rejected his economic theories even though those theories were the basis of much of what modern economists like Friedman used. Moreover, the reliance on their thinkers relies on the belief that economic advances stopped in the 1800s. This is what gives such ridiculous equivalencies as QE=money printing.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:40:26
Here's the deal, you believe that surrounding yourself with people like yourself is a way to prove yourself correct. All you've managed to do is cobble together a group of crazies that believe an enormous amount of stupid. Now, I'm with you, I'm a big liberal statist. I believe unreasonable things like the state manages externalities well and that you don't actually own land because the state effectively lets you rent it. But you believe idiotic things like the moralization of inflation.
Libertarianism tends to find two things in monetary policy and then simply make them equivalents. QE=printing money. In this case it's inflation=printing money. The reason that ya'll do this is that you need the bogeyman to rear his ugly head as often as possible and arguing that the state continually does this thing just by a different name is convenient. It also takes on a more sinister sort of motivation when the state rotates the names it uses. Yet, reading your post, as is typical, you are wishing upon a star that the state erodes and that I am reduced in some Darwinian fire.
Your idea of society is terrible. Your philosophy is evil. You believe in the great reboot wherein you end up on top, and the people at the bottom are genocided so that you can stand on money mountain saying, "I told you so." And you believe that because you think that you have secret knowledge and when other's challenge your secret knowledge you entrench yourself. Here's the thing, you have read exactly one economist (if you've read him at all). You have no ability to back out and do the math of the claims. 97% since 1913, for example is an erosion of about 2.8% per year. You probably believe that it's simple to just have 0% inflation. You'd be wrong. 3% is the Fed's inflation target. They basically hit it over the last 100 years, which is remarkable. And they tell you that that is their target. Meanwhile, over the same period of time, the market has grown by about 9.9% per year which means that $10 put into a broad portfolio of stocks 100 years ago would have grown commensurately to 81920. Simply, a policy of slow inflation, even if you adjust a well invested dollar's value on this metric of money losing 97% of it's value, means that in 1918 dollars, you have the spending power of $2460. Meanwhile, if you had put your money into the Libertarian investment of gold, your $10 would be worth the 1918 equivalent of about... $10. So you're money would have grown to a whopping $400 or so in today's terms. Your investment strategy and belief systemover the last 100 years would have lost you $80,000. So if you'd like to talk about whether your policy of value growth is smarter than my policy, let's actually compare real numbers. You don't know what you're talking about.

Listen to adam kokesh much? Laws backed by violence.... The state has a monopoly on force friend. That's what distinguishes it as a state. Sometimes force is violence.

At the same time, I bet you have a thesis on when you would be willing to "bear arms against the state" in an act of violent protest. So then what? In a world where you even have that thesis, are you the one whose words are backed by violence? Because I think that it's just better to understand the world exists in a very tenuous sort of state where everyone is considering violence against everyone else. And your capacity to commit the very thing you accuse the state of means your anti-violence and anti-state rhetoric is nothing more than virtue signaling to your friends who are also thoughtless.

The details are obvious. You can back into them. The SEC is going to approve something that looks like this: the company that is issuing the shares in the hotel will be able to build a "blockchain inspired" database that will allow individuals to purchase equity in one single property. Now, given the tax implications, etc, this will not be able to be done in a conversion from Bitcoin/ETH to whatever is being sold. That means they will probably have to fund a "coin" using a ticker symbol. So they will be able to pull in funds from places like Fidelity and Vanguard. The end result will be an innovative way for companies to offer more targeted equity offerings. None of this is new, it's just that no one thought to do it until Blockchain. And what's more, it's not even useful. Except that you could, potentially, divest yourself of elements within a company that you consider to be toxic. So if you don't think this hotel is a great investment in the overall portfolio of the company, maybe you don't put money in it. But all this would be, then, would be a company that has wrapped inside of it a ton of DBAs. This might have the effect of changing the way that bankruptcy works. Like, maybe Amazon could bankrupt specific parts of the company. But, honestly, I suspect, already, that this is how hotels and most businesses operate currently. I don't know for certain, but it wouldn't surprise me. The only other thing this might do is allow for huge amounts of foreign investment. But I suspect the SEC will kabosh that once it's seen. Ultimately, this will regress to be exactly what we have.

Why would you assume I care about fairness? It's funny for me that a Libertarian would ask me a question about fairness, when the entirety of Libertarianism is about competency being a value vaccuum. If I asked you if financial inequality is fair, you'd say, "it's a function of markets." But when it comes to printing money, you want an articulation of what is fair. How stupid.
You know who else is greatly benefited by a well-managed currency dumb dumb? You. The state is made up of people like you. So the notion that the entity that creates money is benefited greatly should be wonderful news to you.

Lol. So deflation is just -(inflation). If it deflates, it can also inflate.

But Libertarians are convinced it does.
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:58:55

@_date: 2018-03-01 17:11:17
RE: "doesnt help when over half the world doesn't have access to financial instruments" Yes it does. That's why the US is the richest nation. This should stand as an example to run a coherent economy. Also, this is a diversion from the argument about inflation and money. Generally this sort of hail mary argument is tossed out when a person feels a wee bit of cognitive dissonance. I strongly recommend you explore that.
RE: "protect them from inflation and leeching middle men" Inflation is a fact of money. Inflation exists to help the market better articulate value. It lets you slowly distribute money and give more and more units of distributable fiat to articulate the value in the economy. Money is supposed to be a physical articulation of the value that exists. Inflation is a small, redistributive tax on that value that you don't have to pay if you can just put your money into places like the market. 
RE: "Leeching middle men" This is one of those libertarian conspiracies that just won't die. Middle men aren't leeches. They exist because they made some process more efficient. If you remove a middleman or improve upon their process, you can profit from that difference. Or, if you are good at what they are good at, you can compete the profit margin down for their business. The best example of this is remittance. Remittance companies run paper thin margins. You probably think they profit big off the poor. You'd be wrong.
RE: "also inflation stems from the issuance of debt and seems to directly funnel into the hands of the few banking and investment conglomerates." No, inflation stems from a lot of issues. The issuance of debt being one of them. Birth/death rates another one of them. International use being another one. All sorts of causes of inflation. Don't be myopic. Now, the issue of money being issued through banks is another problem entirely. It's a complicated problem that a lot of other economists agree with you on. If you don't like it, go to school, study the issue, and figure out a better, mathematically more efficient way to do it better. Because this is the same problem Bitcoin has with mining. Bitcoins are issued through the miners. THe miners are basically borrowing against their electricity. It's no different. The bondholders are just the electric companies and not other countries in some sense.
RE: "inflation is good for the economy if the money injected goes toward actual investment, not propping up toxic assets" Yes. Which it does. Now, can't say the same for all the money flowing into these ICOs.
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:43:04
Shall we refer to Thomas Sowell's opinion on Keynes since you seem to think you have such a smarty pants grasp on it?  Interesting how the person who taught you "Basic Economics" doesn't even give such a strong rejection of Keynes. Would you like to recant or would you like to double down?
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:14:20


Yes. This is roughly true. I don't know that I think Libertarians "hate" poor people. Most Libertarians I know do not have any money. But they do spend their time preparing for the demise of society and chicken little-ing about our impending doom. Then every 10 to 20 years they are right about a market dip.


No, it's not the complete opposite. It is an anti-science political view that is as bad as rejecting evolution. "Audit the fed!"  No one talks about that. It's already audited. The Libertarian credo is a continuous string of lies and absurd, unfalsifiable statements. It's very different than old-time Libertarianism a la Milton Friedman. There is no place for moral norms in economics. Moreover, Libertarianism in the modern sense is about 3 inches from communism. If you don't believe that, then answer why it is that so many Libertarians were sympathetic to Bernie Sanders in the US. The reason is that his values map on to Libertarian values, in spite of the fact that Libertarians would vehemently oppose the label fo "socialist" or "communist." Ultimately, both comunism and Randian Libertarianism boil down to utilitarianism. Here's the thing, you can't have voluntary communism. This is the Libertarian use-tax fallacy. You can live in a communist society voluntarily, only if the communist society is in a system that is not communist. These social, structural changes really need to be implemented at the state level - otherwise they aren't incurring the full cost of the ideology. Why can you be a communist in America? You can in the same way that Libertarians can have gun-toting militia men. The government allows people to have ideologies and to exercise their ideologies until their ideologies spill out and become an externality.


NAP works in a civil society. Hilariously, NAP is simply a Nash equilibrium strategy that says I do not aggress until I am aggressed. I return kindness with kindness. So you can be moralistic about NAP, or you could spend a little time exploring which Nash strategy will win against NAP. It's actually simulatable. And if your entire strategy is a kind of Nash equilibrium strategy, then you have removed it from the realm of morality. All I have to do is pick a more efficient strategy than NAP. You've basically destroyed your ability to do foreign policy if you subscribe to NAP because the entire world will just employ a strategy that wins your stated policy. Try it here: 


Absolutely. Libertarians believe that they are fully responsible for their own success. This causes them to misunderstand the necessity of redistributive programs, they think that taxation is theft, and they don't understand the need for paternalism. In Bitcoin, that has resulted in people investing in scams. With regard to taxation, Libertarians do not understand that unless they have a highly specialized job or high ability to negotiate salary (like a union), w/o taxation, their salary would basically be whatever they are taking home today. So if you make 30k, and your tax bracket is 30%, your salary in a world without taxes would be 27k because that is the amount that you are actually willing to work for. The $3k delta would go to hiring more people or to the profits of the risk taker. An employees taxes are not actually the employee's taxes. They are basically a way to tax the owner of a company.

Markets act differently depending on conditions, times, and surrounding realities. At times, markets respond well to policies that are ascribed to Keynes. Sometimes, markets act in a way that Hayek-ian or Friedman-like ascribed policies work better. The reason is that both Keynes and Friedman were writing about truth. Friedman's writings articualte truth as do Keynes. Just because they observed competing behaviors at times, it doesn't mean that they can't both be right. We call this nuance.

I'm actually not referring to blockchain security. I'm referring to a problem with holding non-fungible assets on a chain. I would suspect, very strongly, that this is not a blockchain. It will be a database, and the idea will be blockchain inspired. Because, consider, I own 10% of this hotel because I'm rich AF. Then some thief comes along and steals my tokens. Now what? He owns 10% of the tower? I think not.  Those tokens need to be able to revert back to me. If they can't revert back to me, then this system is a sham. Blockchains are good for fungible assets. Ownership in a building does not meet that criteria.

Well then you should study the history of money. When regional printing was a thing, banks would employ such tactics as locating themselves far in the country so that it became hard to exchange dollars for the thing backing the currency. IN some places, you could spend one kind of money on one side of town, and another kind of money on the other side of town. Likewise, there was an enormous price guide that was released giving exchange rates for regional banks. It was a difficult, cumbersome system filled with scams. People would regularly lose their money when holding the bills of a bank that failed. So if that's what you want, then more power to you.

There aren't any citations of crazy buying and selling. You are picking a single source with no actual knowledge of the criticism of the source. Mackay's book was written 200 years after the purported tulip bubble and is fantastical at worse. And you have no evidence other than his fantastical account. The actual evidence supports a rise in price for a single month in 1637 that, weirdly, isn't even out of the ordinary as far as prices go. Now, could the Tulip Bubble have actually happened? Sure. Do you have any evidence that it did outside of Mackay's book? No.

It doesn't necessarily. But your thesis is that the supply is being created for static demand. But that's not how it works. You have a dynamic supply. The best currency is likely the most useful currency. It will have the most demand. This is a number that changes. This is why a currency can go rotten, and inflation for that currency can soar. The market, itself, causes the value of the money to collapse. The supply doesn't even have to change for that to happen. The currency just has to fall out of favor. The USD is used all over the world for all sorts of transactions. Supply goes all over the world for all sorts of things. Additionally, since it is a medium of exchange, money can be further created which creates additional weird risks. Euro-dollars were a good example of that. Tethers right now are another great example of that. The bogeyman known as fractional reserve banking is another great example. The printing of money is a difficult thing to manage, because when $1 is printed, that $1 can actually be used to generate... I don't know... $10 worth of value in the economy. So there isn't a strict equation between printing and inflation, in fact the correlation is pretty low.

I assure you I'm as dumb as the rest of them. And all of that is good for Bitcoin. But the question that one must ask you, if you believe that a currency backed by something is important, is what is Bitcoin backed by. I suspect you will say something like "mining" or "hashing" or "immutability." But then one could give as trivial an answer to your question. The American Dollar is backed by "labor" or "Oil" or anything else.

You're completely wrong and have no idea what you're talking about. You haven't looked at evidence or primary sources for this.
Extraordinary Popular Delusions is the center of the criticism here. The book relies on Mackay's word and anecdotes. There is little to no citation in the book, and almost all modern rhetoric regarding the tulip bubble is pulled from the work. It is the earliest work if its kind and it came about a long time after the purported event.
If you read the book and don't understand the largely specious stories in it, then you either didn't actually read it or have your head up your ass. The best piece in the book to illustrate this, in my opinion, is the story about the sailor who ate a Semper Augustus tulip bulb. He used it as a relish for his herring sandwich mistaking it for an onion. He was found later (hours later) just in the midst of eating his sandwich. He was arrested and thrown into prison for months. There is no evidence for this story, and it is often repeated as an example of the craze that surrounded the tulip bubble.
Garber's work is the best on this. He analyzed prices from the era and shows that prices of tulips then were no higher than they are today. He cites the modern prices paid for rare bulbs. The price is exorbitant, hundreds of thousands of dollars. Usually it is companies that buy them and then turn them into new varieties of tulips to sell to mass audiences. When the item goes for sale to mass audiences, the price comes down to normal levels almost immediately. The behavior of paying that much for a rare tulip bulb is absolutely not irrational, and is done on the regular.
So the question is whether prices for non-rare bulbs increased. There is evidence that for one month in January 1637, prices increased 20 fold: "The only facet of the speculation for which an explanation does not emerge from the evidence is the 1-month price surge for common bulbs in January 1636, when the price rose up to twentyfold.... prices rose by about 26 times in January 1637 and fell to one-twentieth of their peak value in the first week of February." Garber uses primary sources for his evidence, and his work is far more comprehensive than Mackay's story-telling.
The fundamental problem with your belief in the tulip bubble is that it is unfalsifiable and enters into your psyche as profferable evidence that "bubbles" exist. There is actually a lot of debate about whether bubbles can exist - the central question being whether prices paid during certain periods are mathematically and obviously "irrational." I think it's difficult to say, as you do, "there are bubbles... of all sizes

Debt monetization and quantitative easing are not similar. They share characteristics, and you can criticize them both. But they are not the same thing. Again, these Libertarian tropes are the reason that it's difficult to discuss this subject. Your understanding of both QE and DM are not in line with what QE and DM actually are. Moreover, the notion that because Zimbabwe did it it's wrong is like saying that 99% of people who get in car accidents were listening to the radio, therefore the radio is what causes accidents. All of these financial instruments are profitable when used correctly. There is a fine line between using them correctly and debasing your currency however. But let us not fall into the rhetorical trap of reductio ad Zimbabwe. There have been plenty of countries who have debt monetized that did not end up in such dire straits as Zimbabwe. So that should indicate that there is, at least, a spectrum of quality to the execution of these methods.
If you want a good book that will help you understand the thinking behind America's decisions throughout the crisis, read Stress Test. You might not agree with it, but it will at least give you insight into the process of saving an economy. You will find that it is entirely iterative. America's methods were based largely on Sweden's methods (I believe) which worked in Sweden and seem to have worked here. We executed it slightly differently. Our politics required certain modifications.

It's not out of thin air. It's a highly regulated system that gives us an incredibly predictable increase in the money supply. How much outstanding money is there? That's difficult but not because of fractional reserve. If you want to criticize the monetary system, you should at least have some understanding of what you're talking about - and Libertarians don't.
There is a really salient critique one could make about the distribution of fiat. Having it distributed to the banks and then doled out is kind of awful. The Fed has absolutely no way of remediating this. They have tried, like when they released the Sacagawea dollar coin through Walmart. But they are still relying on corporations to release moneys. I think the government believes this to be egalitarian, and it probably is fairly egalitarian. I'm not sure how else they would do it. Bitcoin might actually have some interesting applications there (though probably not). But you should take your Libertarian rhetoric and re-examine it. It's stupid, and you don't have a great understanding of why.

It's not created out of thin air. You have to ask yourself what money is. Money is representative value. The value that it represents is created by those doing things like labor. You are absolutely dependent on a benevolent fed to create value in a responsible way. The Federal reserve has in its charter an actual inflation target. The whole market funds represent the value of the entire market. This isn't held up by the largesse of the fed. It is held up by companies creating real value. The reason the Fed can't prop up things with gold-backed currency is because there isn't enough gold to represent that value. We moved to paper currency instead. This actually has a lot of advantages. It's not magic, though it is amazing. What we have today is an iteration of what has been developing. If you want to understand the modern state of things, read One Nation Under Gold. It's a phenomenal history of gold. You will see that a large portion of the debate around backed currencies was committed by those who held large quantities of gold. They were lobbying Presidents and congressmen alike. You'll see that backing the currency in these metals was lobbied for because it creates the world's greatest hodler.
The disambiguation of money from precious metals is an important part of history because it is an acknowledgement that value is not an asset. It is soemthign that is, in fact, being created. Like Bitcoin, what you need is a decentralized system of ledger management. This is what cash got us. Cash is a new invention. It was an outgrowth of the late 17th century notes created by the Bank of England which were like early checks, and then later by John Law in his creation and running of the Mississippi company scam. It was an iterative process, and it's remarkable.
The problem with a backed currency is that the currency is necessarily tied to the market capitalization of the asset. So as the world grows, while there might be a metal that is sufficient for representing that value, there comes a point when that value is so great, that it can no longer be represented by one or even a number of elements. This is actually a good thing. It frees up value to be created from those resources. Gold, for example, has only limited uses. But decoupling it from its use as a ledger allows it to be used for those things. Maybe we'll never find a good use for it. But at least the metal is free to be used now.
And that's actually why Bitcoin is amazing. Bitcoin has no use case, for th emost part, outside of its use as a ledger system. It takes up no space, it is self-regulated in some ways. It lets you opt out and opt in. It's a bearer asset. All of these things are amazing features of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a great place. But as you mentioned, pressing enter is a much cheaper way to produce a currency. The seniorage on fiat is going to be way less than Bitcoin. This is actually something you want. Ultimately, we pay for the creation and debasement of our currency as citizens. If money costs $6,000 to create, then you will pay that in taxes or in fees somewhere along the line. It is a significant expense. So when the state can create money by adding it to electronic balances, this actually means that it can create more representational value for less money. This means more efficiency for you, lower prices, lower taxes, and more.
Ultimately, it's probably fractions of a penny in terms of what the actual amount is that is saved per person, but it is savings. On the other hand, Bitcoin is expensive. It costs thousands to produce a Bitcoin. Blockchains are inefficient data structures. Just consider that while the Federal Reserve can probably keep its ledger on 10s of computers, Bitcoin requires thousands of node operators. Whereas the Federal Reserve can create more money with the sweep of a pen, it takes thousands of computers hashing to create Bitcoins. So in a world where we care about efficiency, then we have to ask ourselves what the fuck it is that Bitcoin gives us. The answer is pretty simple. It gives us spaceless cash. It allows borderless transactions without the scrutiny of anyone. Permissionless value transfer is an amazing feat. Cash does permissionless value transfer as well. It's not spaceless, however. Cash does everything Bitcoin does, and it does it at a significantly reduced cost... until it doesn't. Remittance to places like Venezuela is easier and better with Bitcoin. Buying drugs from Chinese factories is easier and better done with Bitcoin. Sending money to gamble in online casinos is done better with Bitcoin.
But cash is better when it comes to doing local exchanges - like the often lauded purchase of a cup of coffee. Remember Voltaire: do not make perfect the enemy of the good. And don't be dishonest enough to ignore the costs of your choices. Bitcoin isn't a cheap choice. It's expensive. It's necessary sometimes. And digital bearer assets are a complete and utter disruption to the state of the Universe. Amazing! But you can't acknowledge that without first acknowledging the incredible disruption to the Universe that non-backed, state issued currency is/was. Perhaps the state is evil. But I suspect that this line of thinking isn't where you'll find the great Satan. Rather, you'll see that this great system is why you own an iPhone, a 60 inch television, and are going to live to 86 without much effort.

Lol, this is the best question I've ever been asked. It's like a choose your own adventure of crazy.
I believe that WTC 7 fell because Satan came forth and commanded upon its head that it ought to lay to the ground and worship the debris that had been created by terrorists hitting the first two trade centers. Upon Satan's command, the tower fell to the ground, trumpets resounded, and the LORD Jesus came from heaven whereupon he bathed the earth in his glory and separated the goats from the sheep. He looked upon the fallen tower and said "It is good." And by this action, the whole of the earth was saved and brought into his glory and given bread and wine and sundry grape-like fruits. This restoration and redemptive act was predicted in the 4th century by a philosopher who wrote, and this is roughly translated, "thereon where the crumbled assets lay, dead in piles of sullen gray, once standing tall and proud, dost there no longer stand, And block the western sun, from shining on that land. And there upsprung from there, shall water to emerge, and flow forever forth, on blackened granite stair."

Dearest subject,
I am quite a bit sorry that you have learned nothing during the last century whence the value of money itself was decoupled from precious metals. The problems with coupling value, as such, are too numerous to count. First and foremost, there isn't enough of any one given element to represent all of the value that must be represented. More than that, one must recognize the simple problem of definition proposed in the question of backing.
What does it mean to be "backed by" a metal? This is the subject of debate and its resolution is near impossible. Yet, as I'm sure you will consider in your wisdom, it is often stated flippantly with no regard to its meaning. It is said as if its meaning is obvious. I would encourage you, as your liege, to recognize its obviety and to consider wherefrom you have gained such a concept.
Let us explore, for a fair moment, the notion that coinage is what you mean. This, I believe, is the most modern conception of something being "backed." Where, may I ask, does the value of such a coin come from? What does one do with a coin that is worth 1 tomato one day and 1,000 tomatoes, or 10,000 tomatoes days hence? This, it seems, poses a problem, and it is a real problem. The solution in days past has been for me, the king, to present to you the value of a coin by fiat. This, I would say, is worth precisely 1 guilder. And you would spend it as such. This kingly dispensation of value, however, nearly bankrupted the crown in the 1600s and encouraged arbitrage of a disheartening sort between people who were melting down our coins and trading them in France for gold itself. So this posed a problem. Additionally, there were individuals of incredible disrepute clipping the rounded coins such that the silver contained therein was lessened greatly and the purported metallic content of each coin was questionable.
And what say you of the fact that a majority of these precious metals today are put toward the sale of commemorative coins, purchased by Libertarians for the preservation of their notional value. This seems a highly masturbatory system of valuation, one propped up by the purchasing of those coins itself.
Then again, perhaps you are not speaking of coinage and are speaking instead of the value of a paper note whose value is propped up by a holding of some precious metal. This would be a fine thought as well, save for the difficulty of a states need to hold the asset all the while ensuring that there is enough of it to trade. This quagmire nearly bankrupted her majesty's United States whence before the notes were disambiguated from the metal, the country's supply of the yellow metal was as a dry river bed. The United States made an emergency delivery to Her Majesty's Treasury whence it was nearly completely dissipated by way of global trade.
The notion of backing by one metal or another is one that has endured considerable efforts of those whom lobby for the metal of their own holding. The merits of silver backed currencies are most lauded by silver traders. The merits of gold backed currencies are most lauded by gold bugs. This has been the case for more then a century.
And what of the cost of producing dollars and Bitcoins. You are wrong about the price of making a single Bitcoin. The actual cost is more like $6,000. This wasn't always the case. But as a commoditized endeavor, mining for profit is a dubious proposition. Insofar as it is profitable, this is a temporary glitch in the system that will be quickly rectified as more energy-burning specialists enter into the profession. The cost of hitting enter for the fed, is quite a bit as well. This is a reductionist understanding of how the Federal Reserve goes about making money. It is not simply the application of pressure upon a keyboard that allows for the creation of more fiat. It is through a robust, and difficult set of government orders that money comes into existence. And to its fake-ness. Yes, it is as fake as the things you can purchase with it. It is as fake as the labor you produce in its pursuit. It is as fake as the mansions built with it. Yes, my friend, the money your government creates is fake. And all of the things you have gained by its existence are fake as well. It is for this reason that one is encouraged highly, to avoid its holding. Holding it is effective as holding water in your hands. Inflation, like a sieve with water, will render trivial once large amounts held. This can be mitigated through the process of holding not cash, but the securitized ownership in companies that was invented in 1605 when the Netherlands first created the Dutch East India Company. Even more encouraging are such modern innovations that encourage your holding of the whole market such as Vanguard's total Stock market index fund. This tool, while not as seaworthy as the company's emblem would rather suggest, allows you to reduce the supply of dirty un-backed fiat and invest it into the economy you are attempting to exit.
Alas, I can not prevent you from such wrong-headed thoughts as you are giv'n to, but I can certainly do my best to inform you of the incredible tools you have access to. Perhaps you will make use of them. Perhaps you will not. But at least you are now aware of them.

Ok, so thanks for answering Maybe you can help me then since everyone here seems too blinded by passion for the project to engage. I'm not saying I dislike the project. I'm trying to understand why it's more useful than what exists.
So, RE these nodes, are they just routing traffic to stores? Or are they doing something else? You as the store owner are still hosting the store on a single computer right?
So... what happens when 100 people connect to your store at once? What happens when you turn your computer off? Does your store disappear? What happens if your computer is nabbed by LE? Is all communication encrypted? Is buyer/seller info stored on your harddrive or is it stored somewhere else by the network?

You can do that, it's Adwords. If you look at the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs), you'll see the adwords ads that surround the rankings. Those organic results are purely algorithmic. But there are a lot of interesting searches that web marketers are seeing nowadays where results that are organic are being combined with some paid elements. [Mike Blumenthal has been tracking this trend and has some great content on it]( That said, most of those results where there is a combined organic/paid listing are local searches.

u/suninabox is right mathematically. You're wrong mathematically. And your reasoning is idiotic. The reason to dollar cost average is because you can't afford to take on the risk at a given moment, so you buy in as you're willing to take the risk. What suninabox is talking about is called "taking your risk early." Simply, if you're expected return is X over term t on a random walk that drifts upward (the axis around which the random walk occurs slopes up), then your best bet is to take your risk as soon as you can. Over time, your chance of loss decreases as the random walk follows its path up. Even if it goes down for long periods, the chances that it won't eventually wash out any big losses over time is very low.
Look at the S&amp;P 500 for a good example. On average it has returned 9.9&amp; over the last 100 years. Invest 100 years ago, keep your money in the market, and look at it today, you would realize that events like the long-lasting depression are barely a blip. Moreover, your returns would be basically the same if you had invested at any point along the curve. They would be 9.9&amp; +- some small variation. The later you invest, the less opportunity you will have to share in that return.
Bitcoin is highly risky. So if you believe it will follow a similar trajectory, then the right strategy is to put as much in as you can as early as you can. That said, this is a unilateral bet, and you are exposed to the risk of the asset you are dumping money into in a unique way that dollar cost averaging (feels like it) avoids. If that is a risk you are not comfortable holding, or if your age doesn't permit you to hold the asset long enough to wash out losses, then Bitcoin is probably not for you or you can dollar cost average. But if you had taken your risk early on Bitcoin with an investment thesis that it will moon, you would be a very rich person right now. That's the opportunity cost. You chose to do other things with your money. You made out less well than people who took on all the risk. That doesn't make them better or smarter, it might even make them dumber. But that's what happened. Personally, I put about 5&amp; of my money into Bitcoin and the rest into the Total Stock Market Index. I'm very comfortable with that allocation given my age. And I also dollar cost average because it is the strategy that lets me sleep at night. That said, it's the wrong strategy.

Well, I hate Circle :). But that's just me.
Those kinds of "growth hacking" campaigns work. I mean, you're literally paying people to do your lead gen for them. It is revealing. If giving people $5 is profitable, it makes me wonder what you're worth to them. My guess is that Circle is hoping you keep your coins in their system. That said, for a financial company like Circle, $5/lead is probably ridiculously cheap. If you're doing lead gen for a financial company, they are going to pay you $50+ for each lead. So for a company to win those kinds of leads, it is a really cheap way to get those leads. Again, I have no idea what their lead gen costs look like.

Those GA listings are frustrating. It's kind of genius what these referrers are doing. That said, it's annoying.
If you want to, you can filter them out. You have to know a little Regex. If you want a good analytics resource, I read [Avinash Kaushik]( The way that i usually setup my analytics is I have an unfiltered profile, and then one wherein I enact a lot of filters. I want one where I can capture all the information. In the other profile, I can play and manipulate data so it shows what I want and what I don't want. I also make other sort of throw-away filtered profiles to experiment. Any filters I like I bring into my primary filtered analytics profile. I've never bothered to filter these sites, because they make up such a small proportion of my traffic. But I am seeing them show up from time to time. I imagine for those with less traffic, these might show up as a significant source of traffic. Is that what's going on for you?

This is really a biz dev question. I don't have a Harvard MBA. I suspect very strongly that BitPay is in trouble, however. I actually said it after the night of the bowl. I was with some friends and we took the only Tampa bay taxi home after the bitpay party. It was like 2am or 3am. We were his last call of the night. When we asked him how many Bitcoiners had called that day, he said 0. I realized that if BitPay's employees (CEO included) couldn't be bothered to use their Bitcoins... let's just say something smelled fishy.
The reason is because merchant adoption is great for Bitcoin's users. But there probably aren't more than around 60,000 of us in all reality. So if you want to focus on merchants you probably need to focus on building the user base. Tipping non-Bitcoiners on reddit is really functional. I thinkt hat probably grows the user base a lot. And it does it witout requiring the expansion of merchant adoption because tipping (I suspect) is a largely closed loop economy. The tips get tipped. So you don't need Microsoft to accept BTC while people start tipping each other with it. I think we probably learned that from DOGE coin.
My guess is that we'll see BitPay disappear. Probably get subsumed by a bigger company, maybe it's clients will be rolled into CoinBase. I think that the first place we will see widespread merchant adoption are going to be Marijuana dispensories. I think we will are on the bring of seeing widespread user adoption in places where having money presents more risk (risk being a function of volatility and opportunity cost) than having Bitcoin. So... maybe some African nations, Argentina, Brazil if things go bad... I don't know. But I think we're going to see some of that very soon.
Bitcoin works. I don't need to do much. That said, you're hitting on why I did this AMA at all. I think that making Bitcoin easier to use is a function of innovation. Innovation requires risk takers. Anyone in Bitcoin now has a propensity toward taking on more risk than the general public. So... guess who I suspect is going to be the best innovators in this space. By the way, for all of you reading this, that higher risk probably means that your idea will fail. But hopefully, I'm giving you some tools here, that will give you a small, slightly better chance at succeeding. That's not a slam on anyone. But it is reality. (I had about 6 failed businesses before Alarm Grid worked, and not even Alarm Grid is guaranteed to work forever... just happens to be working now)

Ha! No one cares about this except Bitcoiners. If it works it really will upend a lot of content creation. How it would affect things, I'm not really positive. But if you are tippign writers, it means that the content hosts become a lot less important. So... I don't know... if this works... it could be amazing... it might also fuck shit up real bad. What does a world look like wherein there are no publishers and only content producers? I don't know. It may be a better world. It may be a worse world. What Bitcoin does to the future of content is unfathomable to me. I can barely keep up with Bitcoin month to month. So I do my best not to step into the unknowns like the question of what will happen someday as a result of BTC.

Are you trying to rank for like 4 days? Or are you trying for permanent rankings? The advice you're giving is almost all rooted in parts of Google's algorithm which really haven't been important since between 2009 and 2011. Keyword heavy domains... done. Keyword heavy domains with dashes... done done. Landing pages with thin content and similar variations of the keyword... no chance in a competitive field. &lt;H1&gt; and &lt;H2&gt; tags are statistically uncorrelated with ranking anymore. Links... well they matter a lot... just not as much as they used to. I stopped actively link building about 2 years ago because building good content is a much more effective ranking tool now than getting links. Title tags are very important, but are probably going to become much less important in the next year. Keyword saturation metrics don't matter at all anymore. You don't get penalized for using a word too many times. It used to be that you would want to check and make sure you didn't use your keyword more than like 6% of the time or something like that. That's pretty much gone. Now, if you write like poop, you rank like poop. Google's semantic web algos are getting much better. So what I know about you is that you are competing in non-competitive markets, and your ranking because your content is unfortunately better than what exists. If I jumped into those markets, I would probably be able to destroy your sites without even trying to build links.

Hahaha. Nope. Decentralization is super inefficient. Bitcoin is a giant rube goldberg machine that is end-running government. You want an articulation of the efficiency of decentralization, look at the cost of running Bitcoin. Tens of thousands of dollars, millions of watts, etc, just so we can stop spending paper.
Just answer this question: is it more efficient to have a few centrally managed databases stored on a few redundant cloud-based computers store millions of stores? Or is it more efficient to have millions of computers (all of which need to be running and online), storing individual stores themselves. The answer is having a couple servers (which are just computers) storing millions of stores is way more efficient than having millions of computers (which on the whole will be low-power servers)...
Here's another question, what if you sell something that is super popular - say you sell security systems like my company alarmgrid.com. What happens when you have 100 people visiting your store at any given time? Are you going to use your home's bandwidth? Are you going to throw your OB store onto a server? So... if you can't just use your computer at home, and you have to host it on a server to handle the traffic, then all you have done as the OB project is created a new browser for something that acts exactly like the internet. So, suddenly, you realize, having an OB store is nothing different than having a store at a .onion. But instead of TOR, in order to access your store, you have to use the much less used OB browser. So... again, what good is it?

Well, getting legitimate links won't hurt your site. There is a lot of discussion around the perils of things like guest blogging. These sorts of discussions are stupid. If an article has a link to your site because the link makes sense to put there, you won't get penalized. I ask all of our vendors to write us up, talk about how we're doing something unique because it helps them, it's a sort of testimonial, and the links definitely help us. they are good links because the content is relevant and good. The article isn't as good and useful as a NYT article, but it's good. And I really don't care if it's dofollow or nofollow. Write good content, get some links. I really don't believe strongly in link hunting anymore though. So, get links when you can. But basically, just kind of do good content on your site, and on other people's sites.
That online FAQ strategy that I link to way at the top is gold. If you want content, that will give you content forever, and it's good content. Really really good content. It was written up in Search Engine Watch in an article entitled [16 Secret Google Analytics Advanced Segments Worth Their Weight in Gold]( You can get a ton of mileage from it. Oh, and it's free to implement.
Blog a lot. Use YouTube. Leverage Facebook. Use Mailchimp if it's useful. Tweet a lot. I mean, you gotta get creative. If you want to get some inspiration for fun things you can do, google "[Wil Reynolds]( He's always been one of my favorite thinkers in this space. He has a team of people doing big projects in Philadelphia and he has built a creative, inventive environment wherein his marketers are allowed to try some of the weirdest things you could imagine. I like to think I'm great at this, but I'm always humbled when he says stuff because some of it is so obvious but weirdly off the wall. I just can't believe I didn't think of trying it. But he basically does this AMA strategy where he gives all his secrets away for the purpose of benefiting everyone. His tactic works. It gets him business. But it also means for those that can't afford him, you can build your site using the same tactics a big agency does. His best message is do RBS (which means Real Business Shit). Don't worry too much about gimmicks, don't try to influence rankings through manipulation. Just write good content, host good events, get real links from real, useful places. Don't worry about where your next link is going to come from. Think of how to get another useful user to do what you want them to do. That might mean you bid on a keyword using adwords, it might mean you write an article about Kraft cheese being sued for buying too much wheat last year, it might mean you host a pie eating contest in your local city. But if you are asking about tactics that destroy your site, you're in the wrong frame of mind. As "how do I build my business?"  instead.
Any marketer worth their salt should be in that same mindset, asking, "how do I build your business." If a marketer tells you all about the links they will get you, or the keywords they will rank you for... they are not going to get you results.

Because, my questions and questions are very good. I'm guessing that Andreas will probably spend 5 minutes looking at Eris and come up with the exact same questions. So then you can either do what you do with us which is dismiss his questions and further embarrass yourself, or you can answer them and actually help people understand why this is so obviously a great project that is about to change the world.

Ha! I was just talking to Aaron Lasher about this a few weeks ago.
There are so few wallets. I'm a web marketer, so I'm not exactly sure how to compete in the iOS marketplace, though I suspect its more of the same. Probably understanding some of their ranking algos, and then competing based on weird, probably still underdeveloped, manipulable metrics. For an online strategy, I would take it straight to wallet questions. I would get ranking for every keyword associated with "iphone Bitcoin wallets," "Bitcoin apps," "Why Apple doesn't like Bitcoin apps," "Should I buy an android or iPhone if I'm into Bitcoin," "What is the best Bitcoin wallet," and all sorts of questions like that.
I generally do what I can to own the space, and with Bitcoin there is no reason that someone can't download your wallet alongside other people's wallet.
More content ideas:
"Mycelium vs Airbitz"
"Mycelium vs. Breadwallet"
"Mycelium vs. Coinbase"
"Mycelium vs. Circle"
"Airbitz vs. Breadwallet"
"Airbitz vs. Coinbase"
"Airbitz vs. Circle"
"Breadwallet vs. Coinbase"
"Breadwallet vs. Circle"
"What is the best Bitcoin wallet?"
Own the conversation around all wallet discussion. If they choose Breadwallet it's because it's the best wallet. These sorts of articles just make you a great resources, they show that you are interested in helping the community, and that you trust people to make the best decision for them. Mycelium is great. Good luck competing with them. But from what I understand, you guys have an amazing product. I am on android, so I don't get to use it. But you will see if you go with this strategy, how powerful owning conversation around an entire space (even your competitors) can be.
These are some just low hanging fruit articles to get started. I would just make content like that. I would probably replicate every single one of these on YouTube as well. Do some good, unprofessional (but better than shit) videos, get them transcribed using speechpad.com, write good descriptions of each one, and probably host them on your site. There's more... but if I'll only reveal it if you actually do this stuff since... no one ever wantsto do the simple stuff ;P

So I'm going to give you the rundown of what I would do if I were running a betting site. I am not running a betting site, so all of this might be stupid. But just so you can understand how I would go about this.
First, I split sites into content types. Content types are not different than each other. Text is text, for the most part, but if you categorize content, you can really build a site using sort of weird silos that iwll allow you to interconnect everything. Also, if you schema mark it up, you can do some reall amazing things with content.
For a betting site, you make your money on bets placed. So you obviously want that behavior. So you need a content type where people convert into betters. Getting someone to make a bet is the same as Alarm Grid getting someone to purchase a security system.
If you do a quick keyword search on these sports events, you will very quickly see that the highest search term has to do with tickets to sporting events. 
Where am I seeing this?
Good question. I used [Google's keyword planner](
So I am seeing a lot of keywords for tickets. So X vs Y tickets tend to be a very common search. These search terms are interesting because they are ephemeral. They come and go, which means that almost any site can compete for them if they do it right. So I would make a ticket content type.
I would make a versus content type (this is quasi-evergreen for a lot of sports where the teams do not change from year to year). These I would make landing pages that pull in tickets having to do with the X vs Y games for the season. For one-offs like the pacquiao/mayweather fight, i'd make the page, add the ticket, and then pretty it up so that you could compete on the P vs M tickets keyword. The META title would be "X vs Y tickets [year]" and I'd have it dynamically change the year each season (unless there was some reason to have one setup for each year for historical traffic. I'd have a bunch of content (not copied) about the history of these two teams matching up, and why it's important. Then I'd list the tickets. I'd also have a call to action button that says, "bet on X vs Y." I might even give people a little flake to start betting with like centsports did just to encourage signups.
Those odds comparison tables, I would definitely not group them by sports. I would group them by matchups. Odds comparison tables, by the way, should be another content type. That way you can include them in places like a blog post, or on these pages, or on other spots on the site. For the page with teh odds comparison table itself, I might title the pages "X vs Y odds." I would have a landing page for the betting on each game as well entitled "bet on x vs y." On this page I would have a call to action that lets them bet. I would include the odds content type in some ways, I'd have tons of content around analyzing who to bet on. I'd produce articles for each bet like, "why you should bet on Pacquiao in his Fight against Mayweather" and similarly something along the lines of (but not exactly) "why you should bet on Mayweather in his Fight against Pacquiao."
I'd also then do videos on the content, build up a celebrity sports guy that will tell you what he thinks will happen in the fight.
THere's more, but that's enough for now. The reason people dont' succeed when they build sites is because the amount of work in getting these up is inordinate. THink about it, I'm basically telling you to do about 10,000 pieces of content over the next month. That's nuts. Content is hard, expensive, and the ROI isn't always there.

Meta keywords haven't been a ranking metric since about 2010 (I think that was around when Google pulled support). I never put them in anymore. The only thing that meta keywords will do is really just forecast to your competitors which keywords you're targeting. That said, I don't even recommend targeting specific keywords anymore. I think it's important to take a holistic approach here. Write tight, good, on-subject content. And then write a lot more of it. Interlink them on-site with good descriptive text.


Meta descriptions do not have anything to do with rankigns anymore. They can affect clickthrus. Matt Cutts made a great recommendation. Don't worry about optimizing every description. Write them in cases where you are getting bad traffic, or where you think you could improve your clickthrus. webmaster.google.com is a great way to measure that stuff.


These are important when they are used appropriately. You want to use ratings for things that need ratings. Yoast should be using schema.org's protocol to make this easy. Joost is a very competent developer (despite loving Wordpress). I haven't looked at Yoast recently, but star ratings are great (if they are used appropriately). When you decide to add them ask yourself the question, "would I benefit from knowing the rating on this content?" If the answer is yes, then you might want to add them.


Spend a good amount of time on these. Make them about 55 words long. Make them descriptive. Google is doing a lot of title trimming these days, however. Even so... use these well.

It's a bad idea.
You have to understand, most subscription businesses are working on a strong chance that they will not receive the last month's payment for service. So they are taking on inordinate risk. It's a fine assumption, but the majority of subscription businesses are pretty low margin. Apart from that, you need to account for the cost of chasing people down who do not have push payment processing. This is an expensive proposition.
The discount rate you are applying for purchasing up front is incredible as well. You are advocating that the business give a 40% discount for paying up front. That's ridiculous. It would probably mean that their monthly is way too costly. Tbh, the amount a business ought to discount for paying up front instead of at the end of the year, is probably a fairly simple NPV calculation that would include some percentage of customers that won't buy unless the option exists, some percentage of customers that won't buy because the option exists, and some percentage of customers that would have paid the regular fee and instead take the discount. If you don't know these numbers, you're going to apply random discounts as you just did here.
The truth is, subscription businesses are hard. They suffer from high attrition rates, and those are hard to control. Insurance, I believe, has something like a 40% attrition rate year over year. This is hard as hell to overcome.
The way that a bitcoin monthly service fee will work is going to probably by keeping some amount of coin in centralized places and authorizing those services to sign for you for certain expected txs. Or... maybe we see debt leveraging instruments that can be paid off with Bitcoin. We will call these things credit cards, and they will be push based, and they will allow you to spend Bitcoins that you don't necessarily have. If only we had something like that today maybe recurring payments wouldn't be so difficult in the real world.

Depending on the niche, local search can be hard or easy. Most niches are really not that difficult. For the best resource on local search, you need to read [David Mihm's yearly report on local ranking factors](
For the get started guide on my end...
Make sure there is a page dedicated to the location. Make sure that the Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) listings are on the page and marked up by schema.org. In the meta title on the page, I usually use the format [This service or product in City, State].
On the page, I make sure that there is lots of text (minimum of 300-500 words). The text will be personable, but it will also have great keywords related to the location. Make sure to mention the location a few times as well as the service(s)/product(s) being sold in the text.
Get a [google places page]( get a [bing local listing]( and then [head on over to Yahoo and do the same]( Probably worth grabbing the [Yelp.com page]( as well.
Then there are a number of services that you need to sign up with for aggregating data. The way that the local search algorithms work is distinctly different than the organic algorithms. Whereas, for example, links matter a lot in organic listings, in local listings it's the listings online that list your NAP and the quality of those sites. There are about 200 billion other factors (exaggeration), but those are the two big ones. Take a look at [this]( if you want to understand the local search ecosystem.
Once you've claimed all your listings on the search engines, you need to get your data to one of the aggregators. The aggregator you use will make this very simple. Make sure your data is correct, make sure you pick all the right codes/numbers, and then head on over to [one]( [of]( [the]( [aggregators]( and sign up (I recommend moz.com's or UBL's aggregators. If you want to do it right, you will probably need to pay between $30-$100 or more each year per location.
Now, you need reviews. If you can do these three things, in a low-competition to medium/high competition niche, you will do just fine for local. Do your best to get reviews on lots and lots of sites too :). This will all take about 45 minutes to an hour per location.

So education campaigns are really hard. On a small budget, this is where you're going to have to get creative. I like Facebook for some of this. If you have a pretty good idea of who would benefit from your product, you can use some incredibly powerful tools for targeting people there. But for the most part, if you want to do a big education campaign, it's a lot easier to do with 1) an experienced marketer and 2) a lot of money. If you don't have either of these things, you're going to have to rely on a lot of luck. Generally, it's better to make a market, then use that market to release a product. Like with Alarm Grid, for example, it might make sense for us to develop and release a security system someday. I assume it is not a good idea. But if you look at the space, that's the trend right now. Canary, Simplisafe, Scout, and more are doing this exact thing. They disagree. But if my company were to release one, we have thousands and thousands of DIY security enthusiasts we could market to because we first used a market of people who are looking for a product they already know exists.

You misread. I said that the mining costs are an articulation of its inefficiency. I said that Bitcoin is inefficient because it's decentralized. Decentralization is inefficient because the only reason to decentralization is to end-run costs injected into a system by third parties, and these costs have to be inordinate in order for it to make sense to decentralize. Examples of times when this makes sense are few and far between. Bitcoiners (like myself) think that currency might be one of them.
RE: Shutting down the node, you literally just took people through my criticism. You shut down a storefront by simply removing the seller. How will they prosecute the seller? Well, he has the storefront on his computer. So... that shouldn't be too difficult. OB does nothing to mitigate actual risk.

@_date: 2015-04-28 17:00:34
It's not rejecting reality. It's rejecting your understanding of how that matters. You're understanding would be that if it takes 15% more to list on Amazon, then on OB it would be 15% cheaper. That's not the case. You need to start thinking about 1) the time it takes to list, the time it takes to package, the time it takes to receive and process payment. The price that you'll have to reduce it by because the risk of non-receipt to the buyer for a single-item purchase is higher than it is on Amazon (yes seller/buyer protection costs money), and the list goes on and on and on. You are not being fair regarding your analysis of the actual cost of selling a good or service.
RE: Sellers hosting their own stores... so you're telling me that every single buyer/seller has a record of all their transactions. So, now we have a system where all the proof needed to convinct a buyer, rather than having the obfuscation of a TOR login, is going to be 100% hosted at home on their own computer?
Moreover, here's the other problem, no one has yet answered. What if you run a popular store that needs to serve 100+ connections at a time? How does the network handle that?

That's a very Satoshi answer. But you still haven't answered the question. What is the use case. You're telling me that it's better because it's more convenient. But it's not. You have to download a small-team maintained interface to your computer, so that you can host a store that would be perfectly acceptable to host in an online marketplace like Ebay or Amazon. Now, if you tell me that it's only for illegal goods then we can talk. And my question for you would be why would you want your entire store (the evidence they will use against you in a trial) stored on your computer? I'm asking you to explain this, because it's a hugely obvious flaw. So is this not going to be the case? Telling me that I just don't understand is absurd. This, I think is a good question. So, tell me why it's not a good question or how OB solves the problem.

Defining an user is probably a lot like defining an attrition rate. There are a lot of ways to do it. In the case of Google, they might do it through signed up members, they might do it by unique users across their platforms, they might use some other metric to define it. In a traditional ad model, you might expect (on the extremely high side) $6/1000 users. If you're a television station, or you're Hulu, you might be able to get $20/1000 users. To get $30/user/year on just ad revenue, you're talking an user having to access your site/properties  something like 30,000 per year. That might be true of a few G users, but it certainly isn't true of most of us. So more than likely, $30/user is not exactly right. And an ad isn't exactly an ad either. Google surveys, for example, pay sites to post surveys before their content. This isn't exactly an ad, but it probably goes in the same bucket.

You don't know how markets work. Middle men exist because they make markets more efficient. You can't simply remove them.

There are no fees there.

Very serious. Illicit goods are a difficult problem to deal with because LE try to enforce the cutting off of the supply chain.

It is inefficient for exactly the reasons I state. Decentralization is effective only when it reduces the cost injected by middlemen. The only reason to decentralize is an ecommerce application is because it sells illicit goods. OB won't do that well, as far as I can tell because you are hosting your own store. Rather, there is one instance of each store. So shutting down a storefront is trivial. In the way that the US government can seize a website, they could seize your store with relatively little effort. So sure, you can't shut it down, but that is not relevant in 99.99999999% of cases. the only time it is relevant is... bum bum bum... when third parties (the government) make the system so inefficient, you have to decentralize.

if you want someone as good as me, you'll have to pay them a lot of money. The truth is, what makes me good is that I'm creative. You're paying for my artistry. When it comes to the basics, [use this guide]( A good SEO will march into your business and make sure that this is implemented. Most projects I have taken on over the years, have ended once this stuff was done because it is the most valuable stuff you can implement.
Generally, when people tell me they want to hire a "good online marketer," it means they want a silver bullet. It doesn't really work quite that way. What I did as an online marketer with clients is I got paid to tell them what to do.
So I would make sure that the Google guide is in place. For betting, I would start writing articles on things to bet on. Get people onto the site looking to make bets. I would probably do a lot of articles on smart contracts. I would be doing things on weird esoteric things like prediction markets, assassination markets, sports, UFC fights, etc. Betting is a hard industry because you're competitors are generally spammers. Kudos to anyone who can compete in a spam industry. It's not fun at all because the rankings are so short lived and nominally valuable if you aren't great at getting them (low payoffs for a lot of effort for most people).
In gambling, your essentially monetizing content. So you need to be writing 10-15 articles each day on the thing(s) you want people to be betting on. Thrwo the occasional, "how bitcoin will kill betting," article out there just for posterity. But you gotta realize, if you have a business that exists because cash money is good at doing cash money things, and your only value proposition is, "we do the same thing those trusted sites do, but we do it with Bitcoin," you are going to limit your pool of users to only the Bitcoin community. To users that come ot the site, you need to explain teh value proposition - not convert them to Bitcoin. You need to say, "this is why we use Bitcoin and don't/can't take credit cards or wire transfers." Articles on, "how to make bets on sports in America," "Using Bitcoin for gambling in countries where it is illegal..." and more. Were I helping you figure out content, those are the directions I would take it.

This is such a dumb analysis of the Big Short. It isn't a story about banks being evil. It's a story about interests run amok. The banks are the ones who discovered the bad tranches. Them, along with rating agencies colluding (on accident) is what caused those bad tranches in the first place. But this has nothing to do with evil banks. Moreover, the movie/book are more story than history. I think the true story here is one that affects Bitcoin. The reason that banks were able to get away with this is because no one bothered to check what was going on with the tranches. A couple people figured out that mathematically, they looked like dubious propositions. But some bankers, to figure out what was going to happen with the tranches, started actually breaking them open like an egg and researching the indiviudal mortgages. They were the first people to actually dig through the items that were securitized. What happened is that they discovered that while it looked like a nice egg on the outside, when the shell was cracked, it was obvious rot. The rot hadn't been detected by ratings agencies because, like is the case with private prisons, the competitiveness of the ratings agencies incentivized good reports over bad since these banks could shop around their bundles and see which agency would give it the best rating.
In some ways, this scenario represents the LIbertarian dream of policing yourself. This ratings agency problem is the outgrowth of pure, unbridled markets. Interestingly, it's worth noting, that there weren't many people that had the ability to look into these tranches. It was time consuming and it was costly. This is a lot like auditing bitcoin code. Anyone can do it, but it's not easy. It's time-consuming and it's costly. We rely on a few experts to do it.
Ultimately, in banking, in spite of all that happened, we have recovered, and the markets are booming. This is an amazing feat. That said, the risk of Bitcoin collapsing is far greater than the "system" as the result of bankers. Bitcoin is given to the same risks. And bankers aren't evil, they are just people like you. They are charged with breaking the system so that we can figure out how to regulate the hole away.

Bitcoin is cash money. Cash money does cash money things. You gotta realize, if drug dealers and money launderers are willing to use Bitcoin, it's because it works, not because it doesn't work. You should probably thank your lucky stars for this PR problem by the way.
I ahve been doing Bitcoin forever. I remember when [Chuck Schumer got on television and told the world how to purchase drugs using the internet]( did the world say holy hell, get rid of that?
The date of that article above is June 5, 2011. I suspect that the reason you're here today has a lot to do with the early drug markets. You have to realize that Bitcoin solves the Byzantine General's problem. People don't understand why that's important, or whether it's important at all. But the effect of that is that as long as the network is big enough, this so-called PR problem doesn't matter. Bitcoin is agnostic to your opinions about laundering money and using drugs. And that agnosticism is a large source of its utility. It is valuable because of it's PR problem. So I think that people need to embrace Bitcoin for all the reasons it allows you to commit crimes. Because in the same way you can commit crime with BTC, you can also do more good than anyone has ever been capable of. You can send funds into North Korea, Zimbabwe, any place with despotic dictator. And you can do it without anyone's permission. That same feature lets you send money to drug dealers and your mafioso compadres with impunity.

@_date: 2015-04-05 00:32:16
The explanation is really simple. Google is dumber than people think. It can't see what it can't read. When you put up a video on the internet, Google only knows what you put in the title and what you put in the description. It also knows that that content is less important than what is in the video. No one goes to a video to read the description. So when you use a properly marked up transcription feed such as the one that YouTube has, Google will know what's in the video. This will be the only time you see me admit this because it's definitely more fun to be a character in the videos, but I'm the one behind the Chris Derose counterparty videos. Chris and I work on content (Chris pitches a lot of the non-evergreen stuff), I give him thousands of BTC FAQs that need some answering, then we find interesting locations, and I make sure that he looks comfortable. The way they are posted, the transcribing of every single video, and the way they are each marketed are my strategies in action. At this point, after about 80 videos, I'm guessing that almost all of you have run into them at some point. This is a small group of people here. So if you haven't hit them, you will. As you notice each one of them is fully transcribed. I promise you, I'm not making money on recommending [speechpad]( though you can see me on [their testimonial's page]( :). I recommend them because transcribing works, and they're cheap and accurate.

RE: URLs, you should get a better URL. For clickthrus and legitimacy, I'd stick with a .com. 301 redirects don't lose 10-15% of your juice. It will be a nearly 1:1 if you implement correctly. You should se little to no reduction in traffic.
URLs matter for clickthrus, but aren't necessarily that important for ranking anymore.
dash keywords were never good for SEO. They were something that you could do to stuff keywords into URLs and it worked. Now it just looks bad. Your clickthrus will be reduced as a result.
RE: "Should I do a site wide url shortening project with 301 from old to new and a .&lt;word&gt; extension?"

I know what data adwords provides. I use Adwords everyday. It is a tiny fraction of what you need for a robust campaign. And if you do not own the site on the other end, tracking metrics is nearly impossible. You can do it by passing someone through a trackable URL. It won't be great, but it would be good enough for something like affiliate. But when you're blindly sending traffic through to someone's site, you will have 0 actionable analytics that are not more than data than that which will answer the question: "how do I waste more money sending more people through with completely unknown results." I appreciate your sentiment. You want to help Bitcoin. If you want to help Bitcoin, do not do it by throwing money into a toilet and bringing other people's money with you.

People who are competing in non-competitive markets will often tell you that some of these tactics work.

Pools aren't the same as centralization. If you don't own your miner, you don't own your hashing strength.

Because it is trivial to leave, it is disingenuous to represent mining pools as centralized entities.

It's actually not a linked list. It functions like a linked list. But a linked list is a specific thing wherein a set of unordered data is linked by way of a pointer to the address of the next link in the chain. A blockchain is an ordered set of data without pointers, just an offset. That said, the distributed consensus part is definitely true.
What a blockchain is is going to be very difficult to summarize in a single sentence.

I imagine that this post is trying to comment on the state of Bitcoin.
But u/bittburger misses the point. Job's response is 100% rhetorical. The accusation is that he doesn't understand technology. He then responds, "you're right, but I do understand users, and I do understand user experience, and that's what I care about" (paraphrase... obviously). The truth is, Apple was built on the back of the work of engineers, and Jobs did understand tech. He was engaging with the interface the man he was responding to had asked him to engage within. He was patronizing the audience and you.
You know what else? Jobs gives the names of engineers he says he appreciates the work of. Yet he was known for taking those ideas, claiming them as his own, and not divvying up credit to those who felt they deserved it. And, while one might argue that Jobs presented the dreams, it is hard to say that it wasn't the engineers who accomplished them. Moreover, there is a difference between user tech and what is inside the machine. Intel didn't start asking customers how they would design a fabless semi-conductor. Yet, Apple used their chips because they were built by the most competent engineers.
Bitcoin is not an end user system. Bitcoin wallets, they are. Coinbase is. Circle is. Trezor is. Bitcoin is the tech for tech geeks and engineers who build production systems on top of it. It should be built competently, with engagement by those building end user systems. That is why we don't have a turing complete scripting language built on Bitcoin. As it becomes obvious what kinds of smart contracts this system needs, they will be built into the protocol. n-LockTimeVerify, multi-sig, experiments like coinJoin, MimbleWimble, and even Segwit perhaps, and I'm sure more, are the equivalent of what Steve Jobs was asking for. Did u/adam3us, u/petertodd, or u/nullc ask YOU whether you needed those things? I know they didn't, because while you may think of yourself as a Steve Jobs type, you probably lack the competency to be a Steve Jobs type.
Those gentlemen could be Jobs competency was off the charts, much like the core team's competency. And when he says something like "you have to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology," I would say that this statement is built on years and years and years of him understanding the capabilities and limitations of the technology. So when he presents a dream, it is within the bounds of the tech. Simply: Jobs spent years understanding the science, then he spent years telling people what the limits of the science were. His exploration of UI/UX were explorations of the limits of the science that he well understood.
Your understanding of the tech is limited, which means that your dreams are unreal. You want 2 megabyte blocks. You want instant confirmations. You want a better UX/UI design. Those are fine dreams, but in order to achieve them, you need to have a understanding of the limits of the system you're asking it from. If I ask you, "what are the costs of 2 megabyte blocks?" You might try to address all the standard r/btc concerns. But the truth is, you have no objective ability to assess the question. Because the question could be better asked, "what are the costs of a hard fork?" And one of those costs is systemic risk to the entire system. Your desire for bigger blocks, which your side has mislabeled as "scalability," could be the failure of the entire system. And before you say I'm spreading FUD, consider that while complete and total failure is unlikely, that is a risk that the maintaining the status quo simply doesn't pose. So the response by those who are competent is to maintain the status quo until the science says they can do otherwise.
It's also worth noting that at every turn, Apple has made decisions that have infuriated users. Bigger screens, no one wanted that. iPad? People said the name sounded like a tampon and that it needed to be changed. Making the power cord smaller, people were livid that they couldn't use their old chargers. Glass screens? People break them every week, but they are so much nicer than the alternative, people deal with it. $600 price tag? You still buy it. A cheaper consumer line? No one was happy about that. Removing the CD drive in Apple airs? People thought that was nuts. While it may not be obvious to you, these decisions were based on data. The removal of the CD was Apple knowing something that you probably hadn't ever considered. I remember when they did it, I thought about how often I used the CD drive, and realized that I hadn't used it in over a year. The science said it was time to take that away from me. But I, the end user, was reticent to let go of it. Apple was right - because data, not because of end user competency.
Now, Macbooks are as thin and slightly smaller than the Air. They are discontinuing the Air line because the science has gotten us to a place where they can make their normal computers as thin as the "thin" line without consequence to most of the other features. Jobs could have just as easily said, "I want a micro-thin laptop" in 1998. The engineers wouldn't have been able to do it because his dream wouldn't have been in line with the reality of the technology. Instead, in 1998, he said "we're going to put giant bulbous, colorful plastic on the back of cathode ray tubes because no one has ever made a sexy monitor. The rest of the product will be great as well, but that will be how everyone knows that this is a mac."
TL;DR: If you want to put users first, you need to understand the limits of tech. If you don't understand the limits of tech, your dreams for the end user system will be out of scope and un-accomplishable, but we will all agree that your dreams are better than what exists. Unfortunately for your dreams, the universe has constraints.

So will Popify's stores.


Not if you sell in Bitcoin, which has no cost. So, your point is now that Shopify allows you to sell product for more kinds of convenient exchange, whereas OB only lets you use Bitcoin. OB loses on this front.


Neither does shopify, if you use Bitcoin. Get your facts straight Sam and stop misrepresenting the truth.


Whereas in Open Bazaar, they simply have to download an app, that will let you access the network in a special browser that will let them search for products, just like they could already do in Google. Would you download the Shopify app to your computer that only let you shop on Shopify? Or would you rather go on the internet and search for products from all sorts of sources like you can do in Google?


This is false on its face. And even if it were true, when was the last time you had to setup hosting or manually configure Amazon.com in order to shop on it?


Then who uses it? Is it a network of robots or are those people selling there real people and the people buying there real buyers? Even if that were the case, if you want a selling network based on compassion, you can go to Etsy.


So is the internet.


OB, as it is proposed in its final form, is as revolutionary as a purple turd. It is certainly unique, and no one has ever seen anything like it. But it's useless and stinky. There is a reason the internet doesn't look like OB. And what's more, OB is as censorable as the internet, which is a whole other discussion. If you don't like the internet, that's well and good, the solution isn't to make another internet with all the same problems of the current internet.

Your responses are woefully inadequate, but I will let the readers decide. I will respond to the "baseless" and insulting accusations, which were also discussed at length on the show.


If I'm right about the other stuff, it is stupid. It provides no efficiencies over incumbent systems.


This is 100% true. It is a claim made by OB developers again and again. And it's false because it doesn't apply to Bitcoin payments on any platform. So it is an articulation of the limitation of the OB platform which is that you cannot use credit cards.


They do. As I just articulated in the previous response. They are not aware of how commerce works online.


I don't know if it's a lie, but if it's not a lie, it's embarrassing. You said that people would discover OB stores through word of mouth. Hilarious! That's how the internet worked (Webrings) back before... the internet had users. This is just an acknowledgement by the team that they do not think anyone will use the platform.


I would stand by that. Good developers, incompetent problem solvers.


This was said in the OB slack. Which I said in the podcast. :)


This isn't baseless. this is based on the other points. And it's Wordpress with WooCommerce plugged in. Again, a pretty good indication you are not familiar with e-commerce.


That was not the claim. The claim was that you can see how useful OB is by asking how often users are going to use Bitcoin to purchase. There aren't many. And you can use Shopify/Woocomerce+Wordpress to accomplish this as well. OB's claim is that on Shopify you have to go through a gateway such as Coinbase or Bitpay so you can't decide your own personal BTC wallet. So WP+WC allows that.


It is if Shopify is. But the truth is that OB could have been built 20 years ago and offers nothing new. The only difference is that you can pay for things in Bitcoin while, just like a website, broadcasting your IP.


It is pretty darn bad along with Patterson's article which he has linked to above. Both betray an utter ignorance of the space they are innovating in.

You cannot do a smart contract without value escrow. It is not smart if it cannot execute itself. And it cannot execute itself if it is not able to hold the value within itself. Just because you have unicorns in your brain, doesn't mean unicorns exist. Reality needs to bite you in the ass from time to time.

It's just the case. It's not a thoughtful critique. If you believe that Bitcoin's just good for payments, you don't have a great handle on what it does. Tor/I2P/Bitmessage is fine. But the Drop Zone protocol can be used over Tor. It doesn't need bitmessage because a secure chat protocol is built in over testnet. But the best bit of it is that you don't need to build a completely solid, decentralized network before you get started because every inch of data can exist in the blockchain. If you don't understand the advantage, either you don't know what Bitcoin is, or you didn't spend much time considering the proposition.

If they have no profit motive, why would they sell at all. :) You can displace any middlemen you want. But if you provide no efficiencies, you will only find that the middlemen were useful. Bitcoin's utility is not in that it removes profit motive. If you believe it is what Bitcoin does, you will have a very hard time trying to find any efficiencies.

If you are new, my personal preference would be to keep them in those wallets. Circle and Coinbase, IMO, are more credible and better at securing your Bitcoins than you will be. Spend some time reading about how to secure them on your own. Understand the risks, understand the risk you're taking by putting them in a place like Circle and Coinbase, and then make a decision for yourself.

It really depends on the person. I generally don't regard it as an exchange. They have an exchange. But the bank portion is separate from it, as far as I can see. I think them and Circle are probably at less risk of insolvency. That said, nothing is impossible, and assess the risk for yourself.

That problem was solved like 1,000 years ago. Stellar and Ripple are going to fail because they provide no efficiency over ACH or Swift.

Coinbase is like a bank. It's like putting your money in Wells Fargo. If someone comes and points a gun at you and says, "Give me your money" it's a little bit more difficult to extract from you. On the other hand, if you hold your private keys, while no one else has them, you will have to store them somewhere. It's like putting cash in your wallet, in some ways (although you can make it reasonably challenging to get your money) you will not have the security that coinbase has. That said, at least you get to make the calls when it comes to who gets to extract your value. There are a lot of good guides on how to make and keep secured bitcoin private keys. I recommend you read these. But my real advice is this: if you don't know how to secure your private keys, you probably shouldn't hold them. If you aren't holding them, you need to understand that someone else is in charge of your money, and you should make sure not to have with them more than you can lose.
TL;DR: if someone has a link to a great guide on how to secure your Bitcoins offline, it would be much appreciated.

As the price goes up, people (you and everyone) get irrational. The evangelism sets in. You tell everyone you know to invest. They get irrational and crazy. They put all their money in... they put all their credit cards in... they mortgage their homes and put the money in... But bubbles burst. And soon they'll find that their exuberance got the best of them. Even if you say, "be rational, don't go nuts, just put a little in," they won't listen to you. They will likely put a huge portion of their personal finances into Bitcoin at the very top... bubble bursts, they lose everything until the next (possible) bubble.
If they are lucky, they will make good money on the ride up. Most aren't so lucky, but some are. Then, a new rash of scams will pop up, they will give their money to them trying to duplicate the wealth they just made by sheer dumb luck.
In the end, the real lesson is, don't invest in shit you don't understand. Your family/friends aren't here because they understand Bitcoin. They are here because they think it will make them rich. If you don't understand what makes BTC valuable, you should stay far far away. Because you will be prone to goodbying all your moneys.

Oh, does Popify sound just like Shopify to you? That wasn't intended. This was just a thought experiment. :)


Ok, so the advantage of OB is that you can pick your BTC address? I hope you don't spend all your money implementing this incredibly revolutionary feature.


If it's better, which I doubt, it's probably like 1% better. Moreover, the reason the vast majority of users pay Shopify transaction fees is because a majority of buyers pay with credit cards because Bitcoins are not usually used.


How can this be possible when hosted Shopify and Magento are setup by filling out a form? Moreover, if you think that setting up OB on an external server is going to be easier than using a shopify or magento installation, then you're nuts.


So OB is an advantage because you don't need to have a domain? Hahaha!


And if OB is successful, you would have this exact same problem. Just to give you your own idiotic critique back in simple English. You believe that the internet is a bad place for businesses because there are too many people there.


And how would one get to these URIs? Oh! That's right! You would need to have the OB browser on your computer and it would open. This is like saying that you can use skype right in your browser because you can click a link that will open the application for you. Blatant lie.


Ok, so we get to the crux of it. You would use Amazon's decentralized free shopping app because you are building this out of an entitlement ideology, not because this is more efficient. OB isn't decentralized. It isn't uncensorable in the slightest. Also, your statement is false on its face. Open Bazaar is going to be a downloadable browser that allows you to access only a non-http based portion of the web. You missed the point entirely, which doesn't surprise me. My point in saying that you don't need to configure Amazon in order to get on it is to say that this isn't a feature of any application. The web is seamless and wonderful, and easy to get from place to place. Moreover, you are ignoring the fact that for any store of any size, you will have to host it on a third party server like AWS. So... tell me now that OB is going to be easy to setup for people with traffic.


So start a website. Oh... in OB you don't need a domain... I forgot. So the advantage of OB is that you don't need to pay $7.50 every year to purchase a domain. You don't need to pay them unless you want to take advantage of the tech they have spent many man years building for great seller/user experience.


You have to be an idiot if you do not believe that buying and selling on the internet is easy. I don't think you're an idiot, so I'll just chock this up to a simple lie.


I agree with this. I'm entering my critiques into the Telos of Christ and you will have to look at them constantly as your project implodes as a result of every thing I have outlined here and in previous posts. I have asked questions of the project, been forced to squeeze answers out of you guys, and have finally come to my conclusions. If you survive it won't be because you created something revolutionary, it will be because your users are ideologues who want to use Open Bazaar for no reason other than to signal to their Libertarian friends how hip they are.


I bet this thing gets used for like 2 days, and that will be that. It's not decentralized, which is hilarious.


This isn't needed in Shopify or Amazon because, as you pointed out, a majority of users use credit cards which perform this function already. So you're wrong. They do provide them. You are nothing but an incompetent boob who has never done anything in the e-commerce space. Based on your rantings, and misgivings about the current state of online retail, I can say with certainty that you have never spent any time actually working in the space. You are incomprehensibly ignorant about it, which makes you a terrible candidate to build anything having to do with it. But that's none of my never mind. Just an observation that I know is correct without even having to look at your work history. The arrogance flows through you, and it is showering down on the masses of actual e-commerce experts and online marketers who are revelling in its stupid smell. :) I wish you luck in the project, but I hope you come back here and check off each of the different ways I have told you it will fail as soon as you become a bit disillusioned with the project's shortcomings.

A token is a message. The difference between a blockchain and a database is that the messages of a blockchain can decompose to value. Eris calls their tokens "garbage" or some similar non Sequitur. But you can call these data whatever you want. It can be a token, or it can be an entry in a database. The only thing that matters in a blockchain will be the immutability of that information, and in a bank chain it will be suspect. Swift and ACH, on the other hand, are very capable of handling and building these value-passing messages. You don't need or want a blockchain for that because the passing comes with heavy regulatory incumbrance.

They were in the course of discussion. I didn't have a list. But I have a lot of questions about OB.
1) What is their value proposition? What efficiencies does their system provide? 
2) You can see the discussion that made them decide to kick me out of their slack here:  The precipitating event was they were butthurt that I called OB "ShittyShopify." When I answered the questions, I entered their slack and said simply, "Dr. Washo, I answered your questions on soundclous :)." Immediately after, I was booted.
3) OB and its supporters calls anyone who asks good questions a troll:  They have done it for some time.
4) OB can't be accessed through traditional online portals. Simply, no one will be able to discover products. They keep saying they are going to decentralize reputation. It's a ridiculous proposition. Google has millions of man hours in its protocol. They obfuscate their website reputation algorithm because the instant everyone knows it, it gets manipulated. SEO is the job of manipulating that data. I asked how they would handle sorting.
5) Where did they get the ebay number:  Who are these sellers? Are they the worst of ebay's sellers, and that's why they aren't able to sell? Or is there some other reason they aren't able to sell? Has this even bern asked?
6) How do you propose supporting a market for escrowers when they will almost never be needed?
7) Why do you believe that the 15% or 10% or whatever it is that an user loses on Ebay/Amazon, can be simply decentralized away? Why aren't these numbers indicative of the actual value that Amazon/Ebay provide in regard to providing customers, uptime, customer protections, seller protections, etc etc etc. Why wouldn't it end up that the OB products just end up 10-15% more expensive?
8) How are you going to ensure network security? It's called a decentralized market, but there is no security in the protocol.
9) How can one claim that OB will be easier to use for people when it requires an external client to work?
10) Why would this be included in their section on arbitration: "Ultimately, through the use of precedents and an arbitration market, a polycentric merchant law is expected to arise in OpenBazaar." Are they trying to build a decentralized market, or are they trying to build a new kind of law? This is very... conspiratorial to me.
There are lots of other questions.

In order to use smart contracts on XCP (which don't exist yet) you will have to use XCP because you need something that is escrowable. Using Bitcoin exposes users to exchange rate fluctuation. XCP is ONLY smart contract fuel. That is it. If you start using Bitcoin as smart contract fuel, you will very quickly see that a decentralized smart contract platform will be exposed to the volatility of Bitcoin. In the case of XCP because it serves only one function, it's price is a function of its use as fuel and nothing else (even though at the moment, it is a speculative asset almost entirely). I don't know how this or any of the answers I have given are anything like dancing around the question. I'm doing my best to answer them very directly.
Merge mining is not a free lunch. You have to realize the more merge mining opportunities that exist, the fewer miners will be working on the merged mine opportunity. They will select the most lucrative mining opportunities. Thus, as this project claims, there is absolutely no way that this chain will be as "secure as Bitcoin." This is a very big lie that should forecast to you the incredible deceptiveness this team is willing to employ, or, if they are not being deceptive, it is a great indication of how little they understand Bitcoin. That is a pretty good indication that this isn't a genuine project with good intentions. As to whether it will be out by early December, we shall see.
The contracts aren't on main net because contracts represent a very big risk profile. They might break the system, so the CP team has decided to be very very cautious about deploying the contracts on main net. I don't care if people are using CP or not. I don't think it's underutilized by the community. Spells of Genesis, for example, is using CP in an incredible way. Other great projects like TopCoin are built on top of Counterparty. You have to realize, there just isn't much use case for this stuff yet. Bitcoin is still on training wheels. Counterparty is on training wheels. It's a new project built on an incomplete project. The possible improvements that sidechains represent over the current Counterparty deployment are incredibly unclear. Sidechains MAY represent a better way to build counterparty. If that's the case, Counterparty will move onto a sidechain. Even still, it will require a mining infrastructure, though it will be far ahead of any platform anyone else tries to deploy. Marc Andreesen is correct about marketing. But that has nothing to do with this discussion. Counterparty is a protocol. Bitcoin is a protocol. Marketing teams are teams of people paid to do marketing. Decentralized protocols do not have them. So while Marc might be right, that discussion is not relevant to this discussion.

Thank you. Everyone in Bitcoin right now thinks that the approach needs to be merchant adoption. I very strongly believe that individual merchants are not going to get any use from it. They will go to hours and hours of training by local enthusiasts, then excitedly implement it on their machine only to find out that no one (probably not even the enthusiastic presenters who told them about it) will spend their coins.
I realized this at the Bitbowl. Bitpay sent out a tweet about 1 single taxi driver that accepted Bitcoin via the Bitpay app. We called the cabby and used him at around like 1 or 2 am. We were the first people who called him to use bitcoin the entire day. 24 hours, in a city with a Bitcoin Bowl, not even the Bitpay employees bothered to use Bitcoin. Huge disservice to the cause if you ask me.

When I hear someone say this, it occurs to me that you are too young to have seen a world without paypal. It was very different. Paypal ushered in the era of modern payments. When I was a kid, my parents (most parents) paid for things with paper checks. Credit cards were not ad common as they are today, and walking into a bank wad a minimum of a once per week activity. That was only 20 years ago. Now, everyone has a credit card, most places don't accept  checks, and you and I buy everything online. Paypal and Thiels team were the coinbase of the early internet. People may not love them now, but do you remember how hard it was to pay for things online before paypal? Because I do.

So smart contracts need to be able to self-enforce, otherwise they aren't a smart contract. That is why they have to escrow value.
If, for example, Bob sees that he's about to pay Alice $10, in your world, all he needs to do to change things is to defund his account so that Alice can't be paid. That's a pretty worthless contract. And you haven't made an improvement over the old system.

Lol, it would depend on what you mean by "studied." I probably have "studied" it in the way that you have "studied" it.
You can't at once declare it a pseudo science and then declare that you understand how it would better work. Libertarians love to talk about the great mess that we're in. Yet the economy has been improving, the jobless rate is pretty darn low, both men and women are able to find work, and inflation has been kept at a shockingly low rate.
I know what you're going to say now. You're going to tell me that the economy hasn't been improving, and that it's like a ponderous house, a melon on two tendrils, that we've boarded the train, and there's no getting off; the system is ready to collapse at any moment. That's a fine statement. Libertarians have been saying it since I can remember. And yet the market continues up up and away. Ok, so now you wish to argue how the jobless rate is manipulated because it doesn't measure people who have dropped out of the workforce. Well... how would you measure it? I bet your proposal is non-sensical. So now you can tell me about hidden inflation. And you will tell me that inflation is not 2% or 3% or 4% per year like the government reports. You wish that the CPI included energy and food. Real inflation, you think, is somewhere near 8 or 10%, maybe as high as 20%. That's all good and well, but it's false. It's conspiratorial. And the claims are unfalsifiable. Telling me we're in a desperate mess is a bunch of hooey, and there isn't evidence for it other than assertions. You achieved such an understanding by reading Zero Hedge and other conspiracy blogs. You and I are not specialists. I would, if I were you, refrain from speaking specially on subject areas you know as little as I do on. Claiming the Status quo is broken is fine enough, but the claim is extraordinary.

A peg in that sense is equally as removed from the process as xcp. The only difference between the implentations is that the security of a side chain will require a mining infrastructure.
@_date: 2015-10-15 22:37:39
Good point Paul. Is bitcoin a sotware license?
@_date: 2015-10-08 13:38:58
It's not cheaper. You need a mining infrastructure. And it's not more decentralized. You need a mining infrastructure. I can't convey this anymore strongly than to explain that sidechains require that miners mine on that chain. I'm unaware of how something can be "more decentralized" than Bitcoin, though, considering that Counterparty rides on the main network.
Counterparty doesn't need mining. It uses federated nodes, and it inscribes the protocol directly into the Bitcoin Blockchain. Very simply, that means if Bitcoin continues to exist, so will Counterparty. That is not the case with sidechains. Other than space in the chain it costs nothing for Counterparty to exist which will be the same cost bourne by a sidechain, except that it will require an entirely new mining infrastructure.
Sidechains do not exist yet. Future thinking is fine. But by the time that rootstock comes out, there will have been a year or two development into Counterparty. And, if sidechains prove a better use case, it could easily be ported to a sidechain. Developing on an unproven system screams scam to me.
The contracts are not in use on main net. You can use them on testnet. The reason that this sub hasn't heard anything more about counterparty since it's implementation is because like Bitcoin, and unlike Ethereum or every other pump in the space, Counterparty doesn't have a marketing team. It is a very humble technology that does some very humble things.

Bitcoin is the native currency of counterparty. Xcp is the gas for contracts. There is no other way to do robust smart contracts on chain. Its fine to claim that a federated sidechain will work.

There are a number of problems here.
1) You think an altcoin is anything that is not BTC. An altcoin is an out of consensus Bitcoin fork. XCP is not that. Also, in a sidechain, you would check Bitcoin out and... end up with some kind of altcoin (by your definition). There would be no difference, except a sidechain would be insecure because it requires a separate mining infrastructure.
2) The metacoin (which is a much more appropriate name for what XCP is) exists because you must decouple the value of smart contract gas from that of the speculative value of Bitcoin. 
3) I didn't bring up side chains. You did by insinuating that the proposed solution as articulated in the title of this post, is a good solution to people not wanting to use an altcoin. You can use BTC as gas for the contracts if you'd like. But it's probably better to use BTC as transactional grease, and have some other commodity act as gas. XCP is escrowable Bitcoin. Bitcoin's contract language is deficient for security reasons. XCP lets you use the protocol to execute smart contracts without having to affect the underlying security of the BTC protocol. And it's done without the rigmarole of a sidechain. Your statement, "it actually makes no sense for Bitcoin users/investors to use Counterparty, when they can use something similar on a sidechain" is a gross overstatement that exemplifies a complete misunderstanding of how sidechains work. You think that it is objectively better to run something in a sidechain without even the slightest understanding of the ramifications. Hell, you haven't even considered whether Counterparty could be built on a sidechain if it is an objective good.

@_date: 2015-10-13 02:32:57
Let me summarize your points, and then I will respond to them. If you don't like my summary, you can further clarify. That said, I'm willing to bet you're about 16.
You are claiming that blockchains generally serve some efficiency over the current banking process. I'm claiming that it does not because the inefficiency in the current process, I would bet, is the result of regulatory incumbrance. Blockchain doesn't remove regulatory incumbrance if it is not public and immutable. The thing that I will also admit is that I don't know much about banking. So I wouldn't pretend to understand how a blockchain will benefit banks. I will only say that I know what a blockchain does, and what it does not do. And I know that the proposed uses of blockchain for banks, so far, are not things that blockchain does not do with any kind of efficiency.
You also seem to also believe that a feature of blockchains are their immutability, which I would agree with. But blockchains are not immutable a priori. They are immutable because the cost to change them is so enormous. Whereas making a change to an entry in a database is a fast, cheap, energy efficient process, making a change to a blockchain costs as much as it would cost to unroll back to the block that the change needs to be made in. This means that for a blockchain to provide the paper trail you are claiming they provide, a bank or banks would have to expend enough energy to make those entries such that it would be so costly to unroll the changes that they simply cannot do it. While this could maybe be achieved locally by forcing a bank that has a blockchain within it to expend huge amounts of energy resources to input entries (say like 50% of their profits), the fact that private blockchains would not be distributed would mean that banks could make changes to them simply by rolling back to a point in the blockchain since they are only needing to check with themselves whether they are honest. Permission ledgers are not going to work because the more efficient, honest thing to do is simply host a database with some kind of journaling technology. That technology would probably be hosted by someone whose trust, in its entirety, is escrowed in their willingness not to make changes to that database. You might call such an entity ACH or a SWIFT.
The reason that the Bitcoin blockchain is so important is that it's so expensive to roll back, it is effectively immutable. No one can make a change without expending something on the order of a million dollars + per day. And that's just to get a fighting chance at making modifications.
The entire reason the Bitcoin blockchain works might be because it removes the trusted centralized database. But centralization is far more efficient. And if you are looking for a solution for your bank that is to decentralize a working centralized process, you are likely going to run smack into a wall of inefficiency. If you don't believe me, look at the announcement by the rebit.ph employee this week  Now, you can make any argument you want. You can scream and yell, and poop on him for making that statement. But he's right. I knew that was the case long before he made the statement  I know how remittance on the blockchain can work. You can read it here:  But what do I know? I am dumber than a mole rat :).

The only problem with Bitcoin is that every single dev that looks at Bitcoin thinks that they are smarter than Satoshi and spends their time building their own Bitcoin: Ethereum, Bitshares, Ripple, Litecoin, Darkcoin, Nxt, etc... If those same developers had built features on top of the Bitcoin protocol, this puppy would be a lot farther along than it is. Then, on the other side, a bunch of starry-eyed morons are declaring problems that no one has ever had are problems, then claiming they can solve them with the blockchain: Synereo, Eris, Factom, Blockchain Factory, Bitnation, (maybe) Storj... (we'll see), and more!!!
So, if you're devs, if you're actually devs, you are the superheroes we are depending on to actually build some useful tech. If you crowdfund here, there is a special place in hell for you because of the money you will be taking from 16 year olds. So don't do that, or Satan will stab you with a pitchfork.
The best project in crypto, is probably Counterparty (IMO), so it might be worth your time looking at them. CP solves a problem, and the devs didn't take money when they started the project.
If you have skills in UI, making Bitcoin products more useful would be pretty awesome. But, my opinion isn't all that popular. I don't care at all about user adoption or merchant adoption. I care about devs scratching their own itch. Don't take money when you do it. And don't listen to anyone about the problems in Bitcoin. Confirmation times are not a problem, but all the 16 year olds here will tell you they are. Ultimately, if you are here to find out what's wrong with Bitcoin, you and your dev team will probably go and start your own version of Bitcoin because you will think the problems are simple to solve that way...
Before you go down the path of starting Bitcoin businesses, here are the first ideas that everyone has regarding Bitcoin businesses:
1) start a bitcoin consultancy
2) start mining
3) start any business then take bitcoin instead of fiat so you can own the niche
4) start a t-shirt company that accepts Bitcoin
5) Fix Bitcoin by raising money and spending years trying to build a perpetual motion machine
6) Fix Bitcoin by starting a new Bitcoin/religion

Occasionally you won't have any free UTXOs. The way that I use counterparty, is I send my BTC in like 10 transactions so that I can in any given block do 10 different things (lie make 10 different assets or trade 10 different times, etc). Might be part of what's going on.

One would need to buy xcp to do smart contracts or to buy assets just as they would have to check btc out to do that on this platform. The difference is that xcp is secured by the bitcoin mining infrastructure. A sidechain needs miners for security. Not to mention counterparty already exists and this is planning on building on something that does not yet exist.

It's better than being a conspiracist friend. You can measure the stupidity of your theory if you'd like. You can go ahead and look at the returns of banks against a base metric, like the returns of the S&amp;P 500. You'll find that banks probably have more volatile returns than the S&amp;P. During some periods their returns are higher, during other periods their returns are lower. But over the long run, they return about exactly what the S&amp;P 500 does. Oh, and if you truly believe that they actually are here to screw you over, then you can own that conspiracy by investing in these banks because they're public companies. You don't believe the conspiracy because you probably hold little to no bank stock. The hilarity of Libertarian stupidity is that the refutations of the conspiracies take no thought to come up with and no time to present. And yet, most Libertarians have spent years steeping themselves in the notion that they are a victim of the system. And before you decry my pigeon-holing you as a Libertarian, I know... I know... you're not a Libertarian. You, like every other Libertarian, are a "crypto-anarchist," "anarchocapitalists" or some other variation of the form that someone told you to use to avoid the stigma of the ideology you adopted in High school and never grew out of.

You believe in perpetual motion. I'm ok with that as long as you admit it. Proof of Stake doesn't work. That's an entirely different discussion, but it doesn't.


Then why not just use a distributed database with the same protections, where all the banks can have a red flag go up in one of the banks tries to make a change that doesn't agree with the consensus?


Banks do not trust each other.


Same with Stellar and Ripple. They are merely sending messages. Their messages do not decompose to value, and are merely promises to pay.


Not if the token can't decompose to value. Also, if you're on a blockchain, and another bank attacks it and rolls it back or figures out how to perform a double spend, then have they broken the law or have they merely operated in a way that is consistent with the rules of the chain. This is an important point, because the only way you can answer it honestly is to say that these chains are arbitrable. As such, they are not immutable. Their outputs are subject to laws and they are not chains of truth, but, rather, nothing more than message passing protocols with some kind of useless token.


And they will fail. Stellar/Ripple aren't good options because they lack the efficiency of ACH/Swift.

BTCS isn't a pump and dump. It just happened to be the first publicly traded pinksheet that used the word Bitcoin in the name. It was also featured on Stossel, which was a big deal. Pink sheets are notoriously problematic. And this one is probably a problem as well.

The reality is, 10% richer is probably not even correct. The average person doesn't have more than $1,000 in savings. So even if you're correct, your saying that the average person would have an extra $100 to their name. The question at hand is whether those taxes, the ones your employer pays or the ones you pay, are actually making us all richer. I think that you don't have to look farther than Pokemon Go to know that it is. Everyone from the poorest of the poor to the richest of the rich are out there getting Pokemon on their fucking smart phones. How much did they pay for this game? $0. How much did they pay for their phone? $16/month. How did that happen? Well, an American company called Apple and an American company called Google, located in the state with the highest tax rates, paid their employees ungodly sums of money for which they paid ungodly amounts of taxes to both the state and federal government, and under this disgusting system filled with bullshit welfare, they filled the world with computers capable of launching the most complicated rockets to the most hard to get to places. At the same time, America's 500 biggest companies grew at a rate near 10% per year. All of that while the fed managed this disgusting, debt-based economy.
I think you're agreeing with us here. And it's the first time I've ever heard you say something specialty. But holy hell, there are a thousand good points to make that make the Libertarian scheme seem ridiculous.
On another note Vitalik, when are you going to exit the ETH scam. You've done a good job there. You learned a lot about taking money from people, and now you seem to want to embrace the markets are efficient worldview. Time to come home buddy pal.

Lol, I mean, if you know him, we'd happily interview him. Is he claiming to be a Bitcoin expert? BEcause I think we'd propably be more inclined to interview him about his pigeons.

Farts are farts, no matter how small. So don't stop the thinking, I believe in you all. Your very small farts won't have to subside, you can sit in them all through the day and be snide. Just consider a moment, consider I ask, that maybe thinking isn't your most impressive task. And while you think long, and while you think hard, remember that Libertarian thinking's more abrasive and marred than any that you have encountered as yet. Though I can see why you think engaging with thoughts that aren't one's you agree with will make you all frightened and frettish and squeamish. So while sitting in mother's home playing with your sister's doll, don't forget that a fart is a fart, no matter how small.

Uh oh, we have another idiot. u/Redtype2, you don't believe in skepticism? This guy is just talking about stupid bullshit.

I hold no strong opinions on anything. But what I do know about QE is that the criticisms leveled by LIbertarians make no sense. As to whether it's a good idea... I don't know. I just know you can't know either.

QE != printing money
@_date: 2016-07-04 00:49:16
Because those poitns are stupid.
@_date: 2016-07-11 20:49:30
I guarantee you don't understand it either. The Libertarian claim is that QE is printing money. It simply isn't. That is a great little primer on it. You can also find Jeffrey Tucker saying that he mis-spoke on QE. Plenty of others who did as well. What's clear is that while we will admit that we don't understand QE, you can pretend like you do, and will sound competent at your Libertarian dinner parties. I won't be popular there, but I will be a thousand miles closer to understanding it than you will be.

You could stop being a goddamn sexist by assuming women can't get here on their own.

Perianne doesn't know what a blockchain is. Amanda is here to advocate a scam. So you can say what you want, but I suspect your not entirely sure what your own point is.

No, it's me ignoring stupid conspiracies. I would do the same thing if she brought up Bilderberg.

:) It's not like we don't air these opinions every week on the show. But posting private convos is an interesting decision. If Alex had asked, the answer would have been, "sure, post it." But to see a convo that you had with someone a few hours earlier show up on reddit with no warning, that's not something I would do.

I think this is a better summation.

Im certain we agree.

I think if you read u/DaReminder's post, you will see that I am in fact the dumber one.

There is more to come. We will be showing the rest of the audio on the show this weekend. We full on disrupted the meeting. u/derosetech got on a soap box and started yelling about how it is a ponzi. I joined; we got kicked out; the meeting ended.

That story is a bit aggrandized. It was a Cleveland Steamer. How people began retelling the story as being an Alabama Hot Pocket is beyond me. Sure, Chris colonel mustarded the Chairwoman. But nothing weird happened.
