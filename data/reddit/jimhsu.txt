The official specifications (call it "white paper" if you want) are here: 
The project itself is here:  ... note the number of commits. The project went through a pretty brutal testing process (during and after burn) involving a lot of stuff breaking and crashing. It's still alpha quality, but judge for yourself what the quality of the code is compared to a lot of "finished" projects.

Most of the assets (including mine - look up TEST) are simply name hogs, but there is one truly "real" asset so far: MPTSTOCK
MoneyPakTrader is a pretty well known individual doing BTC exchanges in BTCtalk, and he issued stock (I presume to also use for BTC/XCP/USD exchanges). Exciting times are here.

I don't think it's necessary to remind people of the integer overflow bug that nearly killed bitcoin back in 2010, or the infamous blockchain fork, or various double spend attacks far greater than what we see here ....
... because the community works around such things. Not by people who cry when the sky is falling, but who sit down and fix these problems when they occur, and before they occur.
Cue the number of times that "bitcoin has been pronounced dead" due to a critical bug.

How it is on top of BTC:
- Shares common addresses (private and public). Every BTC address is an XCP address, so you already have one.
- All communications happens on top of BTC blockchain. Currently uses multisig (escrow) transactions; transitioning to OP_RETURN in Bitcoin 0.9.
How it is not BTC:
- Your BTC balance has no connection with XCP (or any other asset) balance.
- There is no mining.
- There is a decentralized exchange.
- There is decentralized, trustless betting.
 will be a helpful resource.

OP_RETURN provides a consistent way to store metadata (which is necessary for any blockchain extension) without bloating the blockchain. Any transaction with OP_RETURN can automatically be pruned by the reference client. Therefore, it is thought that only projects that need OP_RETURN as well as archival nodes would retain (the relevant, for their project) OP_RETURN info.

Asymmetric cryptography is beautiful in that way. They probably generated it in, oh, about 1 millisecond (that's probably slow). But for anyone else to generate that exact key, even with the power of the entire bitcoin network at their disposal ... we're talking cosmic timescales here. 
Or you could, you know, create your own universe, start a Big Bang, build a hyperspace supercomputer, and get crunching.

Absolutely true; a centralized exchange is crucial for attracting higher trading volumes. Say what you will about HFTs and millisecond traders, but they provide liquidity.
Again counterparty is currently the only coin (or any e-currency) out there with both *working* centralized ( and decentralized ( exchanges. It will be interesting to see how arbitrage develops between the two.

I'm a medical student and converted bitcoin evangelist, so this is of particular interest to me.
The potential for decentralized currencies such as bitcoin (as well as next gen things like DACs) is enormous in the healthcare space. Not just things like physician payments, but truly innovative things like decentralized, transparent insurance companies. 
Imagine, for a moment, a service where people pay 1 mBTC/month into that essentially makes them a "shareholder" in a healthcare services company that offers insurance. Applicable conditions and reimbursements would be decided with, for instance, a voting system, and with another system that associates public addresses with real identity, you now have an insurance system that is totally transparent, fair (to the majority of the participants), and can even *make money* for the insured. This is totally radical stuff in the making.

For this reason, fee operators can set required betting fees, to cover the risk of mediation that they feel is appropriate. The difference is that they don't have to (can't, by design) manage the pot.
@_date: 2014-02-05 01:53:17
Don't need examples, the use cases already exist right now:
1. Issuance - basically creation of DACs (decentralized autonomous corporations). No "next gen" coin needed, the tech is already here. Assets can pay dividends to holders (think ASICMINER), can be bought and sold, and have other possibilities. Our first real asset is MoneyPakTrader, who does BTC/USD exchanges on BTCTalk and anticipates using dividends to pay out profits from his exchange service: 
2. Bets - Both Equal/NotEqual and CFD (contract for difference - variable) bets. Bets are off a feed, and can be anything from price of bitcoin, price of gold, results of Super Bowl (which you can actually see here:  - a 1 XCP decentralized bet on the Super Bowl was in fact completed last week)
3. Decentralized exchange. As of now, you can buy or sell XCP without having to send your money to any centralized entity. At all. No escrow, no flaky exchange website, nothing -- just the power of the Bitcoin blockchain.
You can of course use a centralized exchange, google docs, etc if you prefer. The client is not very user friendly right now, so some opt for these options.

Microsoft also has a lot more money to throw around...
To be honest both approaches are complementary and have their place in extending the value of the blockchain.

Imagine craigslist, but without any ability for any party to scam any other party with "failure to deliver". There is no middleman to handle trust. Just a completely decentralized exchange [the DEX] (that already works, unlike, for instance, mastercoin -- nothing against them though) that is secured by the power of the BTC network.
That said there is a centralized exchange available - Poloniex ( Useful as a good introduction (buy a few, then install the counterpartyd client and do your real stuff in the DEX). DGEX (of NXT) is also looking to integrate counterparty.

Same as bitcoin -- that would essentially hard fork the network. So such a proposal is unlikely to be accepted by, well, anyone.

I'd suggest two additions to the questionnaire:
1. When did you first hear of the word or concept "Bitcoin?" (year, month if available)
2. When did you first come to possess a nonzero amount of bitcoin? (again, yy/mm)
I'm pretty sure I have a nontrivial amount of BTC compared to folks who discovered/bought it as the same time that I did, but it's dirt compared to what I think people from 2012 or 2011 would have. 
And answers for the above: 1. June-July ish 2011, 2. 3/15/2013, somewhere around 2-4pm. Yea, that's a long 2 years. As for the amount ... all I'll say is that I own more now than back in March.
This poll, BTW, is not at all scientific because it targets a particular subgroup (r/bitcoin) on a site/population known for high tech literacy.

This is ultimately unsurprising. All MMO games, in essence, tend towards hyperinflation. I'll explain why below, but here are some posts to read:
Imagine you are a game designer, and want people to fork out $$$ to play a game each month. Do you:
1. Make an intrinsically deflationary currency (relative deflation, of course), so that players will be motivated to save money until they absolutely need to use it, or 
2. Make an intrinsically inflationary currency, so that players will be motivated to use it, increasing the velocity of money and therefore "consumption of content"?
If you have an ounce of economic sense as a game designer, the choice should be obvious. Your job is to get people playing games, not to "preserve the value of their assets" or "motivate them to save". 
Secondly, all games work on a source/sink principle. Sources - things like mob grinding, missions, etc almost, by definition, have to outweigh sinks (repair costs, resurrection costs, consumables) for the game to "be fun". The only way that you can get meaningful "progression" is for this to be the case. Hence by default, inflationary currency.
Now that you've established that every single virtual currency that this audience has been in contact with is hyperinflationary (even if they don't know what "hyperinflation" means), are you surprised that they would think that a "similar" virtual currency created by a guy that they never even heard of is a horrible "bet"?
It isn't even fun.
That said, one of my MMOs of choice (even though I don't play it anymore) -- Eve Online -- hasn't seen that much inflation in the time since I quit (3 years ago). This is probably due to terribly aggressive sinks (lose all items on death), player-driven market for consumables (weapons, missiles, minerals, etc), and the nature of the player base (who sees the hellish experience as "fun"). Try that with WoW and I don't believe you'll make it out of there alive. That said, the Eve player base should be *much* more receptive to cryptocurrency.

The company that makes these: Ziosk (
Agree that it's essentially a perfect setup for bitcoin - everything from ordering to tipping can be done on that, and hooking up a QR code w/ bitpay would make that work. I'd imagine Ziosk has to implement it in their software, before merchants would adopt it.
(One thing about it - default tip is 20%. It also cleverly uses some not-so-subtle psychological techniques to convince you to give higher tips (changing colors, etc). Also, I imagine it saves the server at least 3 trips (one to bring the check, one to get payment, one to give change/final receipt). 
Any .NET developers should also take a look at their Senior Software Engineer position:

The hope at least is a decentralized version of GLBSE (that [in]famous bitcoin stock exchange that recently shut down). With complete decentralization and immunity to subpoenas/cease and desist letters, there's the potential with decentralized technologies for something far superior and far more resistant.

Alas, my time to do detailed research on this is limited (else, I'd be working for a Wall Street firm). I'd invite interested people, though to consider:
* Autocorrelation of bitcoin (i.e. how likely that month x's performance is positive given positive month x-1 performance)
* The adoption curve - how many people have heard of bitcoin? How many people actively use it? How do those numbers change over time?
* How have costs of money transfers as % of assets changed over time?
* What industries are most vulnerable to being replaced? Least? 
* How have Establishment opinions on bitcoin changed over time?
Each of those could be an interesting research paper on SSRN.

Always refreshing to read something from Fama, and not from the evangelist/"die Bitcoin" bank crowd.
His most important point:


In other words, bitcoin's ability to be useful as a currency is directly related to the ability to hedge its value risk. TL;DR: **derivatives**. That's why CFTC's affirmation of bitcoin's commodity status + the encouraging volatility work done by BitFinex is so crucial.
I'll say this again - **the single most crucial next step to bitcoin's survival is the launch and adoption of an efficient, regulated, and legal derivatives (futures/options) market.** Who will be first?
I believe he is mistaken on this point, however:




With non-rate revenues for banks comprising a whopping [44% of revenue and growing]( I'm incredulous that banks can drop those charges substantially or to zero and maintain their revenue streams, which are already under pressure from the [ZIRP]( environment.

I do position trading / investing of various asset classes (everything from US equities to crude oil to inverse volatility), but on the other hand, I have little interest daytrading cryptocurrencies. My *actual* occupation is neuroscience. You're welcome to check out my prev. posts.
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:16:51
And interestingly, the long term (multi year since inception) trend of volatility has been down - I have no idea what will happen, but the stats do indicate that 10x rallies followed by 80% declines may be a thing of the past, or would at least occur over multi-year cycles instead of a few months.
About the optionality: I find it interesting that bitcoin is one of the few asset classes out there with an embedded positive gamma and positive theta. Usually gamma sensitivity is inverse to theta sensitivity. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 20:13:46
I wonder what I'm doing with my life, explaining optionality on a Sunday afternoon :) ... anyways, here's an ELI5 explanation of the concept:
*Note IANAEconomist, so the way I understand things may be different than what business schools may teach students. On the other hand, I haven't been "corrupted" by Wall Street yet. None of this should be construed as financial advice or recommendations to buy or sell any security, etc etc.*
The [financial greeks]( are a theoretical construct that helps explain why an asset changes in price. The grade that you get on a paper is a single number -- but many things go into that grade such as the content, the grammar, length of the paper, whether or not your teacher likes you, etc.
The greeks are:
**Delta** - how the asset changes in price with changes in price of the underlying. E.g. an ETF 100% invested in oil has one delta: it goes up $1 with every $1 that oil goes up. An ETF that borrows money to invest 200% in oil would have 2 deltas - $2 for every $1 that oil goes up. Delta can be any real number (positive or negative). 
**Theta** - how much the value changes with respect to time passing. Think of an insurance policy: if you buy insurance for 2015, the insurance is obviously worth less in Nov of 2015 than Jan of 2015, because it covers less days. Long options = negative theta. Short options = positive theta.
**Gamma** - how much the **delta** changes with changes in the underlying. This is harder to give a real-world example, but something that goes up more the price is away from the price you bought it has positive gamma; ditto for negative. Long options = positive gamma. Short options = negative gamma.
(I skipped things such as vega/rho/whatnot because those sensitivities are harder to explain, and less relevant here).
Actual options/derivatives have direct optionality. Embedded or intrinsic optionality is a bit different, but is another way of saying that the same "concepts" apply, only to things that are not derivatives. E.g. buying biotech stocks gives you greater delta sensitivity than buying conservative utility stocks, because they tend to go up more with a increase in market prices (this is technically called [beta]( but I'm using an example for illustration). Neither biotech stocks nor utility stocks are options, however.
As for bitcoin? My opinion (note, **opinion**) is that bitcoin has positive gamma and theta exposure. Why?
Gamma - As we've seen before and just last month, a lot of the interest in bitcoin is being driven by rapid price increases in a short duration. In other words, high bitcoin prices tend to generate higher bitcoin prices due to [momentum]( That is, until there is too large of a deviation from [intrinsic value](
Theta - Bitcoin becomes more useful over time given greater adoption/infrastructure/investment/clarity of regulations. The value is directly driven by this investment. Thus, it is quite unlike an insurance policy (negative theta) or gold (zero theta).  
*In the long run*, theta is the fundamental driver of returns. The world generally becomes better over time. People and corporations make more money over time. And currencies such as bitcoin would probably become more useful over time.
I'll end with some classic quotes:

Bubbles (systems in criticality in general) don't "deflate" for any particular reason. An analogy is trying to balance a ruler on the end with your finger - the pertubation that causes it to fall is not important compared to the fact that it actually falls (I mean, the underlying instability of the system that amplifies small flunctuations into a crash). 
I recommend this book in particular: 
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:34:08
Or have the guts to sell right after the peak (i.e. bull trap). Got out of virtually all holdings (only single-digits though) @ 200 and 180 after the crash ... worth it. Still have 1 BTC for posterity.
(I did financial modeling just before the crash, and that told me to get out).
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:21:21
(new here). The ironic thing being that cognitive neuroscience has demonstrated that the dopaminergic system (thought to the the one contributing to irrationality) in fact acts rationally during bubbles. It's the "rational" parts of the brain (prefrontal cortex) that tend to act irrationally. I could go more into power laws, log periodicity, herd behavior, etc but I'll stop there.
