People are way more afraid of bitcoin than I thought.  Seems like it's a bad subject in public right now.  It's going to take awhile before people are receptive to change again.  It comes in phases in my opinion.  Similar stages that we through with the internet in the mid 90s.  Remember all the annoying AOL discs?

I don't.  People are actually using it.  It drives the price down slowly from the businesses selling it for cash.  If you watch the blockchain it is constantly doing transactions.  Sometimes i'll watch it for 10 mins or so and count out like $100,000 in bitcoin.  Have faith.  Utilization is on the up.  Adoption is slowed ATM but when Utilization catches up we'll see some fireworks.

I just installed Explorer!  Who's with me?!?!??!

Honestly, I wouldn't own it if I didn't.

This reminds me so much of when it was $20 for so long and everyone was saying, "In a year it'll be worth $40!"  Everyone was like, "Nah..."  Then a month later it went up to like $200.  It dropped soon after that to around 100 for a long time.

Been buying for years.  I'd say it's as safe a time as ever.  As in not at all.  Cheers!
